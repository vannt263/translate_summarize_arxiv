    "noise - induced escape from a metastable state underlies many important phenomena in nature and technology .",
    "it is often investigated experimentally for systems close to a bifurcation point where a metastable state disappears .",
    "examples include josephson junctions @xcite , nanomagnets @xcite , and mechanical nano- and microresonators @xcite .",
    "studying escape in this regime is advantageous in two respects .",
    "first , near a bifurcation point the activation barrier is small , so that the escape rate can be measured in a conceivable time even for low temperature or small noise intensity .",
    "second , the dynamics near a bifurcation point displays system - independent features , including the onset of one or several soft modes . in turn , this leads to scaling of the escape rate with the control parameter of the system .",
    "we will discuss escape for system near a generic saddle - node bifurcation , which is one of the most common types of bifurcations . here ,",
    "for very small values of the control parameter @xmath0 counted off from the bifurcation value @xmath1 , the metastable and unstable states of the system are close to each other in phase space .",
    "the motion along the axis that connects them is slow .",
    "this is easy to understand when metastable and unstable states are a minimum and a saddle point of the potential energy of a particle .",
    "the curvature of the potential has opposite signs at these points .",
    "therefore the potential locally flattens out as @xmath0 approaches zero . in agreement with this picture , for very small @xmath0",
    "the system dynamics is controlled by a single soft mode @xmath2 , which is overdamped .",
    "in this paper we consider systems with very small damping .",
    "their motion may become underdamped even where the parameter @xmath0 is still close , although not too close to the bifurcation value .",
    "the dynamics of the soft mode is characterized by the vibrational frequency at the metastable state @xmath3 .",
    "it is much less than other frequencies , and @xmath4 for @xmath5 . yet",
    "@xmath3 may exceed the relaxation rate , which is characterized by an independent small parameter @xmath6 .",
    "such a situation often occurs in underdamped josephson junctions , for example .",
    "noise - induced escape near a bifurcation point is well understood in the limit @xmath5 , where the motion is overdamped @xcite . here , under fairly general assumptions the activation energy of escape scales as @xmath7 .",
    "this agrees with the scaling of the mean - field free - energy barrier near a termination point of the metastable state @xcite .",
    "as we show , such scaling holds also for underdamped systems further away from @xmath8 provided the metastable and saddle states are still close to each other .",
    "this can be understood for a brownian particle in a potential well . here",
    ", the activation energy of escape is given by the height of the potential barrier , independent of friction ; friction only affects the prefactor in the escape rate @xcite .",
    "therefore the scaling is the same in the under- and overdamped regimes .",
    "the scaling @xmath7 was discussed already in the early work on josephson junctions @xcite and later for underdamped driven oscillators @xcite and magnets @xcite .    as we show , besides the @xmath7 scaling , underdamped systems may display a different scaling near , but not too close to the bifurcation point .",
    "this is because the motion slowing down is not necessarily related to the stable and unstable state approaching each other .",
    "the slowing down may have a different , nonlocal origin .",
    "it can be thought of as resulting from flattening , or an overall decrease in magnitude of the effective potential of the system in a broad range of the generalized coordinate .",
    "we provide a theory of escape for this nonlocal case and find the corresponding critical exponent .",
    "the results are applied to a specific system , which provides an example of this scaling behavior and has attracted much attention recently @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the model of a fluctuating underdamped system . in sec .",
    "iii we describe two scenarios that lead to the motion slowing down and ultimately to the saddle - node bifurcation , in the presence of friction , as the control parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of friction is described in sec .",
    "energy diffusion is considered in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi we obtain the critical exponents for the activation energy of escape , which is the central result of the paper . in sec .",
    "vii the theory is applied to a nonlinear oscillator driven by a strong resonant field and compared with the previous results for this model @xcite .",
    "viii contains concluding remarks .",
    "close to a saddle - node bifurcation point one of the motions in the system becomes slow compared to other motions .",
    "quite generally it is described by a langevin equation @xmath9 here , @xmath2 and @xmath10 are the coordinate and momentum of the slow motion , and @xmath11 is its effective hamiltonian .",
    "the terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe friction and noise , respectively .",
    "we have assumed that the motion is slow on the scale of the correlation time of the reservoir coupling to which leads to friction and noise .",
    "therefore we disregard retardation in the friction force . in the same approximation we disregard the noise correlation time and set the noise to be @xmath14-correlated in time , @xmath15 where @xmath16 enumerate the @xmath2 and @xmath10 components of noise .",
    "the diffusion matrix is symmetric , @xmath17 , and generally @xmath18 depends on the dynamical variables @xmath19 .",
    "the noise intensity @xmath20 will be the smallest parameter of the theory .",
    "we assume that the friction coefficient @xmath6 is small and that the friction force is non - hamiltonian .",
    "the latter requires that @xmath21 is not equal to zero .",
    "the part of the force @xmath22 for which @xmath23 can be incorporated into the hamiltonian , leading to its small renormalization @xmath24 .",
    "this concerns , in particular , @xmath2-independent terms in @xmath25 and @xmath10-independent terms in @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 depends on the control parameter @xmath0 which characterizes the distance to the bifurcation point .",
    "this point is located at @xmath8 , for @xmath28 .",
    "we require that ( i ) @xmath29 be analytic in @xmath0 in a neighborhood of @xmath8 , and ( ii ) @xmath30 for @xmath8 .",
    "these two conditions determine the order of the hamiltonian @xmath11 with respect to @xmath0 uniquely for the different functional forms of @xmath11 used below , i.e. , if both @xmath31 and @xmath32 meet them , then @xmath33 .",
    "the physical picture of motion leading to escape is simple .",
    "the system is initially prepared at some point @xmath34 in the basin of attraction to the metastable attractor ( focus ) @xmath35 . over the relaxation time @xmath36 ,",
    "the system approaches the attractor .",
    "noise leads to small fluctuations about the attractor , but for small noise intensity the system stays close to it for a time that largely exceeds @xmath37 .",
    "ultimately there happens a large fluctuation that carries the system over the basin boundary leading to escape from the metastable state .",
    "the probability @xmath38 of noise - induced escape from a metastable state is a complicated function of the dynamical parameters .",
    "however , it displays a universal behavior in the vicinity of a bifurcation point .",
    "this behavior has been well understood in two limiting cases .",
    "the best known case is a brownian particle in a potential well , which escapes from the well due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the motion of a brownian particle of mass @xmath39 in a potential @xmath40 is described by the equation ( [ eom ] ) with @xmath41 and with @xmath42 being white noise of intensity @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamics of a brownian particle is special in several respects .",
    "first , the value of the momentum in a stationary state is independent of the parameters and is equal to zero .",
    "second , independent of the friction coefficient , the stable and unstable states of the system @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the local minimum and maximum of @xmath40 .",
    "third , as a consequence of the form of the noise , the escape rate has a simple form @xmath46 the exponential factor here is just the ratio of the boltzmann factors in the populations of states with energies of the saddle point and the attractor .",
    "it is _ independent _ of the friction coefficient .",
    "in contrast , the prefactor in @xmath38 depends on @xmath47 @xcite ; however , in this work we will be interested only in the exponent in @xmath38 .",
    "the potential @xmath40 depends on the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the standard analysis of this dependence goes as follows .",
    "when @xmath0 is close to the critical value @xmath8 , the stationary states are close to each other and ultimately merge for @xmath8 ; we set @xmath48 for @xmath8 . for small @xmath0",
    "the potential is a cubic parabola , @xmath49 , @xmath50 locally in @xmath2 ( which has been appropriately scaled ) .",
    "the stable and unstable states are @xmath51 . both the distance @xmath52 and the frequency of vibrations about the potential minimum in the absence of friction @xmath53 decrease with decreasing @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) leads to the scaling of the activation barrier with @xmath0 of the form @xmath54 .",
    "we emphasize that this scaling holds independent of friction , for a brownian particle .",
    "because the friction coefficient @xmath47 is small , the approximation ( [ cubic ] ) applies both where the system is underdamped , with @xmath55 , or underdamped , with @xmath56 .",
    "the critical value of the bifurcation parameter @xmath0 is also independent of @xmath47 .",
    "irrespective of the friction coefficient , very close to the bifurcation point the dynamics of the system is overdamped @xcite .",
    "it is described by a soft mode @xmath57 , which is the distance between the saddle and the attractor .",
    "the langevin equation for @xmath57 after proper scaling and changing to a slow time @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 for @xmath60 the system has a stable and unstable states @xmath61 , which merge together for @xmath62 .    because the motion near the bifurcation point is slow , with characteristic time @xmath63 , and occurs in a narrow range @xmath64 , the noise @xmath65 can be considered white , with a @xmath57-independent intensity @xmath66 .",
    "then the escape rate is @xcite @xmath67 eqs .",
    "( [ overdamped ] ) , ( [ escape_overdamped ] ) can be understood as the limit of brownian motion for @xmath68 , where the brownian motion becomes overdamped .",
    "( [ overdamped ] ) follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eom ] ) , ( [ equilibrium ] ) in this limit , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the activation energy of escape @xmath71 ( [ escape_overdamped ] ) scales with @xmath0 in the same way as the barrier height @xmath72 for the corresponding brownian particle .",
    "we emphasize that the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ overdamped ] ) is not at all limited to systems close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it applies essentially to any weakly fluctuating dynamical system close to a saddle - node bifurcation point , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the scaling @xmath73 has been considered a benchmark of activated escape near a saddle - node bifurcation point . it has been used very broadly , in particular as a tool for measuring critical current of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "we will consider the general case of a system away from thermal equilibrium , which is described by eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) with small friction coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "our major assumption is that , as we decrease the control parameter of the hamiltonian @xmath0 from a positive value @xmath74 while keeping @xmath75const , the system will experience a saddle - node bifurcation . because the system is nonequilibrium , the bifurcation value @xmath76 may depend on the friction parameter @xmath6 . for convenience , in what follows we do not set @xmath1 , but we assume @xmath77    for small @xmath47 the system is underdamped for @xmath78 .",
    "still very close to @xmath76 it invariably becomes overdamped and is described by eq .",
    "( [ overdamped ] ) .",
    "we want to find the _ forms of the hamiltonian _ and the corresponding phase portraits of the hamiltonian trajectories that will be compatible with this scenario of the saddle - node bifurcation .    by assumption , the bifurcation results from the change of the hamiltonian dynamics , not from the special structure of the friction force .",
    "then a necessary condition is that the hamiltonian system has a center @xmath79 and a saddle point @xmath80 for @xmath60 . with weak friction ,",
    "the center becomes a focus .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes very close to @xmath76 the focus becomes a node and ultimately merges with the saddle point .",
    "central to the occurrence of a bifurcation is the slowing down of the system with decreasing @xmath0 .",

    "the major effect of friction is energy drift towards a stable state .",
    "in contrast , noise leads to energy diffusion away from the metastable state and ultimately to escape .",
