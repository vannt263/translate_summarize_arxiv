    "quasars ( qsos ) serve as tools , in conjunction with studies of the intergalactic medium , for probing conditions in the early universe .",
    "these studies rely on the fact that the spectra are , to the lowest order , rather uniform ( e.g. , the construction and application of qso composite spectra ) . we know , however , that the spectra do exhibit differences : the spectral slopes , as well as the line profiles , differ among quasars . in fact , even in a single spectrum , the widths of the emission lines can be vastly different . although these differences may provide insights for understanding the physical environments in the vicinity of quasars ( by constructing inflow or outflow models for different kinds of elements in the surroundings ) , they present substantial challenges when modeling broad and narrow line regions ( blrs and nlrs ) .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the variation in quasar spectra is therefore a necessary and important study .    in the pioneering work by francis",
    "( 1992 ) , the authors applied a principal components analysis ( pca ) to 232 quasar spectra ( i.e. , spectral pca , in which the concerned variables are the observed flux densities in the wavelength bins of a spectrum ) from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; hewett et  al . 1996 ) and found that the mean spectrum plus the first two principal components in the rest - wavelength range @xmath8   describe the majority of the variation seen in the uv - optical spectra of quasars . in this spectral region",
    ", the quasars are shown to have a variety of spectral slopes and equivalent widths , ranging from broad , low - equivalent - width lines to narrow , high - equivalent width lines , with other spectral properties also varying along this trend .",
    "furthermore , boroson and green ( 1992 ) identified several important parameters in describing quasars and carried out a pca on 87 quasars from the bright quasar survey ( bqs ; schmidt & green 1983 ) in this parameter space ( i.e. , parameter pca , in which the variables are the physical quantities of interest ) , from which an anti - correlation was found between ( optical , around the h@xmath10 spectral region ) and @xmath11@xmath7 $ ] .",
    "( this correlation is widely quoted as `` eigenvector-1 '' ) .",
    "more recently , shang et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) considered a wider rest - wavelength range covering ly@xmath6 to h@xmath6 , and constructed eigenspectra from 22 optically selected quasars from the bqs .",
    "their results agreed with boroson and green s eigenvector-1 , and supported the speculated anti - correlation between ( optical ) and ( uv ) .",
    "the conclusions of these studies , however , are drawn from small ranges of redshifts ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ) respectively .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey has the advantage of a large number of quasars , and most importantly , a large redshift range .",

    "it is straightforward to see that , if the number of spectra is greater than the number of wavelength bins , @xmath52 equals the total number of wavelength bins in the spectrum .",
    "an assumption that the spectra are without any gaps was made previously . in reality , however , there are several reasons for gaps to exist : different rest - wavelength coverage , the removal of skylines , bad pixels on the ccd chips all leave gaps at different restframe wavelengths for each spectrum .",
    "all can contribute to incomplete spectra .",
    "the idea behind the gap - correction process is to reconstruct the missing regions in the spectrum using its principal components .",
    "the first application of this method to analyze galaxy spectra is due to connolly & szalay  ( 1999 ) , which expands on a formalism developed by everson & sirovich ( 1994 ) for dealing with two - dimensional images .",
    "initially , we fix the missing data by some means , for example , linear - interpolation . a set of eigenspectra",
    "are then constructed from the gap - repaired quasar spectra .",
    "afterward , the gaps in the original spectra are corrected with the linear combination of the kl eigenspectra .",
    "the whole process is iterated until the set of eigenspectra converges . from our previous work on the sdss galaxies @xcite , the eigenspectra set converges both as a function of iteration steps in the gap - repairing process and the number of input spectra .    to measure the commonality between two sets of eigenspectra ( i.e. , how alike they are ) , two subspaces @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath55 are formed respectively for the two sets .",
    "the sum of the projection operators of each subspace is calculated as follows @xmath56    where @xmath57 are the basis vectors which span the space @xmath54 ( see , for example , merzbacher 1970 ) .",
    "a basis vector is an eigenspectrum if @xmath54 is considered to be a set of eigenspectra . if the two subspaces are in common , we have @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the trace of the products of the projection operators , and @xmath60 is the ( common ) dimension of both subspaces .",
    "the two subspaces are disjoint if the trace quantity is zero , which hence serves as a quantitative measure for the similarity between two arbitrary subspaces of the same dimensionality .",
    "models of accretion on black holes and scenarios for the formations of -blends often predict relationships between the uv and optical quasar spectral properties ( for example , the strong anti - correlation between the `` small bump '' and the optical blends was suggested by netzer and wills 1983 ) . using our sample with 16,707 quasar spectra",
    ", we construct a set of eigenspectra covering 900   to 8000   in the restframe . for each quasar spectrum ,",
    "the spectral regions without the sdss spectroscopic data are approximated by the linear combinations of the calculated eigenspectra by the gap - correction procedure described in ",
    "[ section : kl ] . a quantitative assessment of this procedure on quasar spectra is discussed in detail in appendix  [ appendix : gapcorr ] . to determine the number of iterations needed for this gap - correcting procedure",
    ", we calculate the commonality between the two subspaces spanned by the eigenspectra in one iteration step and those in the next step . for the subspace spanned by the first two modes ,",
    "the convergence rate is fast and it requires about three iterations at most to converge . including higher - order components , in this case the first 100 modes , the subspace takes about 10 iteration steps to converge . in this work ,",
    "all eigenspectra are corrected for the missing pixels with 10 iteration steps .",
    "the gaps in each spectrum are corrected for using the first 100 eigenspectra during the iteration .    the partial sums of weights ( i.e. , accumulative weights , where the weights are the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix ) in different orders of the global eigenspectra are shown in table  [ tab : weights_all ] .",
    "the first eigenspectrum accounts for about 0.56 of the total sample variance and the first 10 modes account for @xmath61 . to account for @xmath62 of the total sample variance , about @xmath63 modes are required .",
    "the first four eigenspectra are shown in figure  [ fig : global_eigenspec ] , and their physical attributes will be discussed below .",
    "the first eigenspectrum ( the average spectrum of the data set ) reveals the dominant broad emission lines that exist in the range of @xmath64   .",
    "these , presumably doppler - broadened lines , are common to most quasar spectra .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : compare_1steigspec_edrcomposite ] , this eigenspectrum exhibits a high degree of similarity with the median composite spectrum @xcite constructed using over 2200 sdss quasars , but with lesser noise at the blue and red ends , probably due to the larger sample used in this analysis .",
    "the 2nd eigenspectrum shows a striking similarity in the optical region ( @xmath65   ) with the 1st galaxy eigenspectrum ( i.e. , mean spectrum ) from the sdss galaxies ( of @xmath66 galaxy spectra ; yip et  al .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_qso_gal ] shows a comparison between the two .",
    "besides the presence of the ca@xmath67 and ca@xmath67 lines and the balmer absorption lines as reported previously in the composite quasar spectrum , the triplet ( which appears to be composed of two lines because of the limited resolution , i.e. , @xmath685169+@xmath685174 , and @xmath685185 ) is also seen in this mode .",
    "the presence of the balmer absorption lines ( see the inset of figure  [ fig : compare_qso_gal ] ) implies the presence of young to intermediate stellar populations near the nuclei ( because of the sdss 3 spectroscopic fiber ) .",
    "the main differences between the quasar 2nd eigenspectrum and the galaxy mean spectrum lie in the balmer lines h@xmath6 and h@xmath10 , which are , as expected , doppler - broadened for the qso spectra .",
    "the quasar eigenspectrum also has a redder continuum , meaning that _ if _ this eigen - component represents all contributions from the host - galaxies , the galaxies would be of earlier spectral type than the average spectral type in the sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "our ability to detect significant host - galaxy features in this eigenspectrum triggers an important application , that is , the removal of the host - galaxy contributions from the quasar spectra .",
    "the properties the host - galaxies of quasars have recently attracted interest ( e.g. , bahcall et  al .",
    "1997 , mclure et  al . 1999 ,",
    "mclure et  al .",
    "2000 , nolan et  al . 2001 , hamann et  al .",
    "2003 ) , mainly because of their obvious relationship with the quasars they harbor and the probable co - evolution that happens between them .",
    "therefore , the evolution of massive galaxies , which are believed to be at one time active quasar hosts ( see hamann & ferland 1999 ) , can also be probed .    on the other hand , narrow emission lines in active galactic nuclei ( agns )",
    "have been considered less useful than broad emission lines as diagnostic tools , because agns with prominent narrow lines have low luminosities ( see , for example , the discussion in chapter  10 of krolik 1999 ) , in which case contributions from the host galaxies may affect both the continuum and the lines , obscuring their true appearances .",
    "hence , the removal of host - galaxy components can potentially fix the narrow emission lines and reveal their true physical nature .",
    "preliminary results ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "2004 , in prep . )",
    "show that it is possible to remove the galaxy continuum in the lower - redshift quasars in the sdss sample .",
    "related issues such as the effects on the broad and narrow emission lines from such a removal procedure are beyond the scope of this paper and are currently being studied .",
    "the second mode also shows slight anti - correlations between major broad emission lines which exist in @xmath69 smaller and larger than @xmath70   ( see figure  [ fig : global_eigenspec ] ) .",
    "the change of the continuum slope , with a zero - crossing ( i.e. , a node ) at around 3990   , dominates this global eigenspectrum .",
    "the optical continuum appears to be galaxy - like , but not as much as the 2nd global eigenspectrum .",
    "for example , in this component the [ ] @xmath683728 is missing , and the nebular lines are generally weaker .",
    "the node at @xmath71   is in partial agreement with the 2nd principal component of 18 low - redshift ( @xmath72 ; balqsos _ excluded _ ) quasar spectra @xcite , which showed the uv - optical continuum variation ( except the node is at @xmath73   ) .",
    "this particular wavelength ( 4000   ) marks the modulation of the slope between the uv and the optical regions .",
    "one related effect is the `` ultra - violet excess '' , describing the abrupt rise of quasar flux densities from about 4000   to 3500   .",
    "this observed excess flux was suggested to be due to the balmer continuum @xcite , as there seem to be no other mechanisms which can explain this wavelength coincidence .",
    "in malkan & sargent s work , an exact wavelength for this onset was not clear .",
    "the node at @xmath71   can serve the purpose of defining that wavelength .",
    "other possible physical reasons for the modulations between the uv and optical continua are the intrinsic change in the quasar continuum ( e.g. , due to intrinsic dust - reddening ) and the stellar light from the host galaxy .",
    "there is also a second node located in ly@xmath6 showing an anti - correlation between the continua blueward and redward of the ly@xmath6 .",
    "since the number of quasars with spectroscopic measurements in the vicinity of ly@xmath6 is much smaller than those with measurements in the uv - optical regions that are redward of ly@xmath6 , the significance of this anti - correlation is less than that of the uv - optical continuum variation in this eigenspectrum .",
    "this mode shows the correlations of broad emission lines , namely , ly@xmath6 , , + @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath7 $ ] , , @xmath11@xmath7\\lambda$]5008 and also the balmer emission lines h@xmath6 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath74 , h@xmath75 and h@xmath76 .",
    "these are in partial agreement with the 3rd eigenspectrum of shang et  al .",
    ", in which emission lines @xmath7 $ ] , , h@xmath6 , h@xmath10 are found to be involved .",
    "it seems natural that these balmer lines are correlated , as presumably they are formed coherently by some photo - ionization processes .",
    "however , it is not known why they appear in this low - order mode .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 $ ] and h@xmath10 vary similarly was seen previously @xcite , and it was suggested that h@xmath10 and @xmath7 $ ] may arise from the same optically - thick disk .      by construction , subsequent higher - order eigenspectra show more nodes , causing small modulations of the continuum slope .",
    "they also show broad absorption line features . since quasars with bals are not the dominating populations in our sample ( there are 224 broad absorption line quasars in the 3814 quasars from the sdss edr quasar catalog , reichard et  al .",
    "2003 ) , their signatures preferentially show up at higher orders in this global set of eigenspectra .",
    "the bal components are not confined to only one particular mode , but span a number of orders . to investigate the effects of balqsos on the global eigenspectra ,",
    "our approach is to perform the kl transform on our original sample ( including balqsos ) and on the same sample but with the balqsos excluded , and make a comparison between them .",
    "there are 682 balqsos ( with balnicity index @xmath77 ) found in our sample according to the balqso catalog for the sdss spectra by trump et  al .",
    "( private communication ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : weight_global_bal_balexcluded ] compares the weights at different orders between the balqso - included and the balqso - excluded global eigenspectra .",
    "since the balqso - included global eigenspectra contain information describing both the non - balqsos and the balqsos , the weight of each mode is larger than that of the balqso - excluded eigenspectra . that is , the balqso - excluded eigenspectra set is more compact .",
    "the magnitude of this offset , however , is small and is apparent only after the 5-th order , which is consistent with the fact that the balqsos form a minority population ( about @xmath78  % ) .",
    "this difference is seen to extend to higher orders , implying that the features describing the balqsos span a number of higher - order eigenspectra and are not confined to only one particular mode .",
    "a comparison of the 6th global eigenspectrum between the balqso included and excluded samples is shown in figure  [ fig : comp_all_allcutbal_6thmode ] .",
    "absorption features ( in this case , in + @xmath7 $ ] and ) are found in the first set of eigenspectra but are missing in the latter .",
    "we have to note that the discrepancies in the spectral features of these two sets of eigenspectra attributed to the weight differences are not only confined to the existence or non - existence of bal absorption troughs as shown here , as the difference in the normalizations between the two can in general also yield different eigenspectra sets .",
    "we will leave the discussion of the reconstruction of the balqso spectra using eigenspectra till ",
    "[ section : bal ] .",
    "to study the possible evolution and luminosity effects in the quasar spectra , our first step is to investigate whether the set of eigenspectra of a given order derived from quasar spectra in different redshift and luminosity ranges differ . the trace quantity mentioned in ",
    "[ section : kl ] is adopted for these quantitative comparisons .",
    "as a null measure , two subsamples are chosen with approximately the same redshift and luminosity distributions , such that any differences in the two sets of eigenspectra would be due to noise and the intrinsic variability of the quasars .",
    "we fix the rest - wavelengths of this study to be @xmath79   , and require a full rest - wavelength coverage of the input quasars ; redshifts are limited to 0.9 to 1.1 .",
    "one subsample contains 472 objects ( subsample 1 ) and the other subsample , 236 objects ( subsample 2 ) .",
    "subsample 2 is , by construction , a subset of the original 472 objects .",
    "the reason behind this construction is to ensure a high commonality of the two sets of resultant eigenspectra .",
    "they both have luminosities from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , and the actual distributions of redshifts and luminosities are similar . the line on the top in figure  [ fig : common_subsample ] shows the commonality of these two subsamples as we increase the number of eigenspectra forming the subspace .",
    "as higher orders of eigenspectra are included in the subspaces , the commonality drops , meaning that the two subspaces become more disjoint . as mentioned above , this disjoint behavior is mainly due to the noise and the intrinsic variability among quasars , both are unlikely to be completely eliminated . at about 20 modes and higher , the commonality levels off , which implies that the eigenspectra mainly contain noise .    with this null measure in place , the differences of our test subsamples are further relaxed to include luminosity effects alone ( subsamples 1 and 3 , see table  [ tab : subsample ] ) , redshift effects alone ( subsamples 3 and 4 ) , and lastly , both effects combined ( subsamples 1 and 4 ) .",
    "the commonalities of these subsamples are overlaid in figure  [ fig : common_subsample ] .",
    "the first modes constructed in all these subsamples , including the null measure , are always very similar to each other ( more than 99  % similar ) .",
    "this shows that a single mean spectrum can be constructed across the whole redshift coverage , which was presumed to be true in many previous constructions of quasar composite spectra .",
    "the validity of construction of the mean spectrum in a given sample may seem trivial , but it is not if we take into account the possibility that the quasar population may evolve at different cosmic epochs .",
    "similar to the null measure , as higher orders are included in the subspaces , the eigenspectra subspaces become more disjoint .",
    "in addition , the commonalities in these condition - relaxed cases actually drop _ below _ the null measure for orders of modes higher than @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the eigenspectra of the same order but derived from quasars of different redshifts and luminosities describe different spectral features .",
    "in addition , our results show that both luminosity and evolution effects have detectable influences on the resultant sets of eigenspectra , very much to the same degree ( in terms of commonality ) . in the case of the combined effects",
    ", the commonality drops to the lowest value among all cases , as expected .",
    "the actual redshift and luminosity effects found in the quasar spectra will be presented in sections  [ section : evolution ] and [ section : baldwin ] .",
    "we learn from this analysis that there does not exist a unique set of kl eigenspectra across the whole redshift range , with the number of modes equal or smaller than approximately 10 .",
    "the implications are twofold . on one hand",
    ", the classification of quasar spectra , in the context of the eigenspectra approach , has to be redshift and luminosity dependent . in other words ,",
    "the _ weights _ of different modes are in general different when quasars of different redshifts and luminosities are projected onto the same set of eigenspectra .",
    "so , eigenspectra derived from quasars of a particular redshift and luminosity range in general do not _ predict _ quasar spectra of other redshifts and luminosities . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of the redshift and luminosity effects in our sample can be probed quantitatively by analyzing the eigenspectra subspaces .",
    "kl transforms are performed on subsamples with different redshift and luminosity ranges , that allow us to explicitly discriminate the possible luminosity effects on the spectra from any evolution effects , and vice versa .",
    "the constructions of these bins are based on requiring that the maximum gap fraction among the quasars , that is , the wavelength region without the sdss data , is smaller than 50  % of the the total spectral region we use when applying the kl transforms .",
    "the total spectral region , by construction , is approximately equal to the largest common rest - wavelengths of all the quasars in that particular bin .",
    "we find that constraining the gap fraction to be a maximum of 50  % improves the accuracy of the gap - correcting procedure for most quasars ( see appendix  [ appendix : gapcorr ] for further explanation ) . as a result",

    "the 2nd mode in every @xmath86-bin has one node at a particular wavelength .",
    "this implies that the linear - combination of the first 2 modes changes the spectral slope .",
    "this is similar to the galaxy spectral classification by the kl approach @xcite , in which the first two eigenspectra give the spectral shape .    for the lowest redshift bin ( * zbin  1 * ; figure  [ fig : zbin1_eigenspec ] )",

    "this hibal ( defined as having high - ionization broad absorption troughs such as ) quasar is chosen for its relatively large absorption trough in for visual clarity .",

    "the first few modes ( @xmath96 for this spectrum ) are found to fit mainly the continuum , excluding the bal troughs . with the addition of higher - order modes the intrinsic absorption features ( in this case",

    "some intrinsic absorption features are found to require @xmath97 modes for accurate description , as was found in the global eigenspectra (   [ section : globalhighorder ] ) .",
    "we should note that in the reconstructions using different numbers of modes ; the _ same _ normalization constant is adopted ( meaning the eigencoefficients are normalized to @xmath98 ) .",
    "clearly , a different normalization constant in the case of reconstructions using fewer modes ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : recon_bal_b3_277_51908_437]a ) will further improve the fitting in the least - squares sense .",
    "while the fact that a large number of modes are required to reconstruct the absorption troughs probably suggests a non - compact set of kl eigenspectra ( referring to those defined in this work ) for classifying bal quasars , the appropriate truncation of the expansion at some order of eigenspectra in the reconstruction process will likely lead to an _ un - absorbed _ continuum , invaluable to many applications .",
    "the proof of the validity of such a truncation will require detailed future analyses .",
    "one method is to construct a set of eigenspectra using only the known bal quasars in the sample and to make comparisons between that and our current sets of eigenspectra . by comparing the different orders of both sets of eigenspectra we may be able to recover the bal physics .",
    "we expect that this separate set of balqso - eigenspectra will likely reduce the number of modes in the reconstruction , which is desirable from the point of view of classification .",

    "this is not surprising as the global eigenspectra must account for the intrinsic variations in the quasar spectra as well as any redshift or luminosity evolutions .",
    "there are , therefore , two major factors we should consider when adopting a global set of quasar eigenspectra for kl - reconstruction and classification of quasar ( instead of redshift and luminosity dependent sets ) .",
    "first , we need to understand and interpret about @xmath99 global eigenspectra .",
    "this is significantly larger than found for galaxies ( 2 modes are needed to assign a type to a galaxy spectrum according to connolly et  al .",

    "this agrees with the commonality analysis in   [ section : similar ] , that there are evolutionary and luminosity effects in the qsos in our sample . as such ,",
    "eigenspectra derived in a particular redshift and luminosity range are in general not identical to those derived in another range .",
    "the accuracy of the extrapolation in the no - data region using the kl - eigenspectra remains an open question for the @xmath37-bins .",
    "it will be an interesting follow - up project to confront the repaired spectral region with observational data , which ideally cover the rest - wavelength regions where the sdss does not .",
    "for example , uv spectroscopic observations using the hubble space telescope .",
    "to study evolution in quasar spectra with the eigenspectra , we must ensure that the eigencoefficients reflect the same physics independent of redshift .",
    "we know however that the eigenspectra change as a function of redshift ( see   [ section : similar ] ) . to overcome this difficulty , and knowing that the overlap spectral region between the two sets of eigenspectra in any pair of adjacent redshift bins is larger than the common wavelength region ( @xmath101   ) for the full redshift interval , we study the differential evolution ( in redshift ) of the quasars by projecting the observed spectra at higher redshift onto the eigenspectra from the adjacent bin of lower redshift . in this way ,",
    "the eigencoefficients can be compared directly from one redshift bin to the next .    without the loss of generality",
    ", we project the observed quasar spectra in the higher redshift bin ( or dimmer quasars for the cross - luminosity projection ) onto the eigenspectra which are derived in the adjacent lower - redshift one ( or brighter quasars for the cross - luminosity projection ) .",
    "for example , @xmath102 ( i.e. , the spectra in the @xmath37-bin * b3 * ) are projected onto @xmath103e@xmath104 ( the set of eigenspectra from the @xmath37-bin * b2 * ) , and similarly for the different luminosity bins but the same redshift bin . from that",

    "this redshift dependency can be explained by either the evolution of chemical abundances in the quasar environment @xcite , or an intrinsic change in the continuum itself ( which , of course , could also be due to the change in abundances through indirect photo - ionization processes ) .",

    "as the second mode in the @xmath37-binned eigenspectra describes the change in the spectral slope of the sample , the above findings support the idea that the balmer continuum , as a part of the small bump , changes with redshift . to further understand this effect , the 3rd eigenspectrum in * c2 * is taken into consideration , which presumably describes the iron lines ( see   [ section : feanticorr ] ) .",

    "the non - trivial value of the regression slope in the case of @xmath127 agrees with the change in shape of the observed line profiles in the small bump regions seen in the local wavelength level ( smaller in width than what is expected in the continuum change ) with redshift . in conclusion , this implies that there exists the possibility of an evolution in iron abundances but with a larger sample variation compared with that for the continuum change .    to our knowledge",
    ", our current analysis is the first one without invoking assumptions of the continuum level or a particular fitting procedure of the blends that finds an evolution of the small bump ; directly from the kl eigencoefficients . because of the large sample size",

    "another example is the @xmath11@xmath7$]@xmath169 and @xmath11@xmath7$]@xmath170 pair .",
    "hence if correlations are interpreted between the emission lines from one local bin with those from an adjacent bin , caution has to be exercised . the uncertainty in the continuum estimation ( e.g. , the iron contamination in the continuum in the vicinity of ) prevents us from drawing an exact physical interpretation of this phenomenon .",
    "two examples of the locally - constructed eigenspectra are shown in figures  [ fig : lyalpha_eigenspec ] and [ fig : hbeta_eigenspec ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lyalpha_eigenspec ] , the eigenspectra are constructed using wavelength - selected qso spectra in the rest - wavelengths @xmath8   ( with @xmath171 ) , so that both ly@xmath6 and are covered .",
    "excellent agreement is shown between our eigenspectra and those selected from the large bright quasar survey in the @xmath172 range @xcite .",
    "the second eigenspectrum ( corresponding to the first principal component in francis et  al . ) shows the line - core components of emission lines .",
    "in contrast , the 3rd mode ( corresponding to their 2nd principal component ) shows the continuum slope , with the node located at around 1450   . besides , the addition ( with positive eigencoefficient ) of the 3rd eigenspectrum to the 1st one enhances the fluxes at shorter wavelengths while _ increases _ the blueshift .",
    "this supports the finding of a previous study @xcite that blueshift is greater in bluer sdss qsos .    at longer wavelengths , the sdss quasars with redshifts",
    "@xmath173 show the anti - correlation between ( optical ) and [ ] ( figure  [ fig : hbeta_eigenspec ] ) , in agreement with the eigenvector-1 ( boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "the first two eigenspectra in figure  [ fig : hbeta_eigenspec ] demonstrate that both the h@xmath10 and the nearby [ ] forbidden lines are anti - correlated with the ( optical ) emission lines , which are the blended lines blueward of h@xmath10 and redward of [ ] . in the 3rd local eigenspectrum , the balmer emission lines are prominent , which was noted previously in the pca work by shang et  al .",
    "in addition , we find a correlation between the continuum and the balmer lines in this local 3rd eigenspectrum , so that their strengths are stronger in bluer quasars .    to date",
    ", it is generally believed that the anti - correlation between ( optical ) and [ ] is not driven by the observed orientation of the quasar .",
    "one of the arguments by boroson & green was that the [ ] @xmath685008 luminosity is an isotropic property .",
    "subsequent studies of radio - loud agns have put doubt on the isotropy of the [ ] emissions .",
    "recent work by kuraszkiewicz et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , however , showed a significant correlation between eigenvector-1 and the evidently orientation - independent [ ] emission in a radio - quiet subset of the optically selected palomar bqs sample , which implies that external orientation probably does not drive the eigenvector-1 . an interesting future project to address",
    "this problem is to relate the quasar eigenspectra in the sdss to their radio properties .",
    "enlargements of the first two locally constructed eigenspectra focusing on major broad emission lines are illustrated in figure  [ fig : linecore ] . except for the almost perfectly symmetric and zero velocity of the line centers of the 1st and 2nd eigenspectra exhibited by [ ] @xmath685008",
    ", most broad emission lines do show asymmetric and/or blueshifted profiles .",
    "these demonstrate the variation of broad line profiles of quasars and the generally blueshifted broad emission lines relative to the forbidden narrow emission lines .",
    "the forbidden lines in the narrow line regions of a qso are always adopted in calculating the systemic host - galaxy redshift , so the clouds associated with blueshifted bels probably have additional velocities relative to the host .",
    "this line - shift behavior was found in many other studies ( see references in vanden  berk et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "the behavior of the shift led richards et  al .",
    "( 2002b ) to suggest that orientation ( whether external or internal ) may be the cause of the effect .",
    "it is also obvious from figure  [ fig : linecore ] that the 2nd eigenspectra are generally narrower ( except for , in which the conclusion is complicated by the presence of the surrounding lines ) than their 1st eigenspectra counterparts .",
    "the line - widths of the sample - averaged kl - reconstructed spectra using only the first eigenspectrum or the first two eigenspectra are listed in table  [ tab : fwhmlocal ] .",
    "the addition of the first two modes , weighted by the medians of the eigencoefficients , causes the widths of 76  % of the emission lines ( with fwhm @xmath174  km  s@xmath26 ) to be narrower than those reconstructed from the first mode only .",
    "hence , most broad emission lines can be mathematically decomposed into broad , high - velocity components and narrow , low - velocity components .",
    "appearing in the second local eigenspectra , the line - widths are thus the most important variations of the quasar broad emission lines .",
    "the line - core components were reported by francis et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) for and ly@xmath6 ; and shang et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) for some major broad emission lines .",
    "one nice illustration of the line - core component of the 2nd mode is the splitting of h@xmath74 and its adjacent [ ] in figure  [ fig : hbeta_eigenspec ] , for they are blended in the 1st mode .",
    "similar properties may be expected in the 2nd @xmath37-binned eigenspectra .",
    "table  [ tab : fwhmzbin ] lists the average fwhm of different linear combinations using the first 3 eigenspectra in constructing some major broad emission lines .",
    "comparatively , for most emission lines the second @xmath37-binned eigenspectra do not show as narrow line components as the second eigenspectra , in which the widths of 61  % of the emission lines with fwhm @xmath174  km  s@xmath26 become narrower by adding the 2nd eigenspectrum to the 1st one .",
    "this effect is mainly due to the difference in the numbers of quasars , and more importantly , the inclusion of a wider spectral region causes the ordering of the weights of different physical properties to re - arrange . in this case , the spectral slope variations are more important than those of the line - cores .",
    "while the 3rd @xmath86-binned eigenspectra ( weighted by medians of the eigencoefficients of the sample ) also do not represent prominent changes in the emission line - cores , except for ly@xmath6 and ( the fwhm of appears to be larger because the line - core 3rd mode is pointing downward in * zbin  4 * ) , on average the quasar populations with _ negative _ 3rd eigencoefficients do show narrower widths for 77  % of the emission lines .",
    "similarly , the 2nd global eigenspectrum does not carry dominant emission line - core components , which are found to be represented more prominently by the 3rd mode ( table  [ tab : fwhmglobal ] ) .",
    "the narrower emission features in the 2nd local eigenspectrum compared with the 1st one , and the fact that almost every broad emission line is pointing towards positive flux values in both of these two modes , imply that there is an anti - correlation between fwhms and the equivalent widths of broad emission lines .",
    "in fact , as suggested by francis et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) , this may form a basis for the classification of quasar spectra in @xmath175   , by arranging them accordingly into a sequence varying from narrow , large - equivalent - width to broad , low - equivalent - width emission lines . from the locally constructed eigenspectra ,",
    "such an anti - correlation is not generally true for every broad emission line as we find that there exists at least one exception : a positive correlation between the fwhm and the ew of in the local bin of the redshift range @xmath176 .",
    "an assumption in these measurements is that the continuum underneath can be approximated by a linear - interpolation across the window @xmath177   .",
    "one complication , however , is the contamination due to the many emission lines in the vicinity of , so the true continuum may be obscured .",
    "the positive fwhm - ew correlations appear to exist in some other weaker emission lines as well , but the weak strengths of those lines do not permit us to draw definitive conclusions under the current spectral resolution . in conclusion , the fwhm - ew relation can help us to classify most broad emission lines individually , but _ this relation can not be used in a general sense , nor does it represent the most important sample variation _",
    ", if the surrounding continua are included to the extent of the rest - wavelength ranges of the @xmath86-binned spectra .",
    "nonetheless , most broad emission lines can be viewed mathematically as the combinations of broad and narrower components .",
    "a future study will focus on finding the best physical parameters for classifying the spectra in the wide spectral region , which will be the subject of a second paper .",
    "one possible approach is to study the distributions of the eigencoefficients and their relations with other spectral properties ( e.g. , francis et  al .",
    "1992 ; boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "the shapes of the continua and the correlations among the broad emission lines of the second locally constructed eigenspectra are all identified in either the 3rd or the 4th @xmath37-binned eigenspectra .",
    "we do expect , and it is indeed found to be true , that the local properties of the spectra can be found in the latter , though the ordering may be different .",
    "the identifications are marked in figures  [ fig : zbin1_eigenspec ] @xmath85 [ fig : zbin5_eigenspec ] by the redshift ranges of the local eigenspectra , with reference to the luminosity averaged * zbin * eigenspectra .",
    "the correlations of broad emission lines are generally found in higher - order @xmath37-binned eigenspectra compared with the orders representing the spectral slopes .",
    "we perform kl transforms and gap - corrections on 16,707 sdss quasar spectra . in rest - wavelengths",
    "@xmath178   , the 1st eigenspectrum ( i.e. , the mean spectrum ) shows agreement with the sdss composite quasar spectrum @xcite , with an abrupt change in the spectral slope around 4000   .",
    "the 2nd eigenspectrum carries the host - galaxy contributions to the quasar spectra , hence the removal of this mode can probably prevent the obscuration of the real physics of galactic nuclei by the stellar components . whether this eigenspectrum is",
    "the only one containing galaxy information requires further study .",
    "the 3rd eigenspectrum shows the modulation between the uv and the optical spectral slope , in agreement with the 2nd principal component of shang et  al .",
    "the 4th eigenspectrum shows the correlations between balmer emission lines .",
    "locally around various broad emission lines , the eigenspectra from the wavelength - selected quasars qualitatively agree with those from the large bright quasar survey , the properties in the eigenvector-1 @xcite , and the anti - correlations between the fwhms and the equivalent widths of ly@xmath6 and @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between the fwhm and the equivalent width is found in most broad emission lines with few exceptions ( e.g. , is discrepant ) .    from the commonality analysis of the subspaces spanned by the eigenspectra in different redshifts and luminosities , the spectral classification of quasars",
    "is shown to be redshift and luminosity dependent .",
    "therefore , we can either use of order 10 @xmath37-binned eigenspectra , or of order @xmath179 global eigenspectra to represent most ( on average 95  % ) quasars in the sample .",
    "we find that the first two modes can describe the spectral slopes of the quasars in all @xmath37-bins under study , which is the most significant sample variance of the current qso catalog .",
    "the simplest classification scheme can be achieved based on the first two eigencoefficients , so that a physical sequence can be formed upon the linear - combinations of the first two eigenspectra .",
    "the diversity in quasar spectral properties , and the inevitable different restframe wavelength coverages due to the nature of the survey , increase the sparseness of the data .",
    "hence , higher - order modes enter into the construction of the broad emission lines with the eigenspectra , in contrast to the galaxy spectral classification , in which most emission lines vary monotonically with the spectral slope @xcite .",
    "this result is also a manifestation of the high uniformity of galaxy spectra compared with quasar spectra .",
    "we find that bal features do not only appear in one particular order of eigenspectrum but span a number of orders , mainly higher - orders .",
    "this may indicate substantial challenges to the classification of bal quasars by the current sets of eigenspectra in terms of arriving at a compact description .",
    "a separate kl - analysis of the bal quasars is desirable for studying the classification problem . nonetheless , the appropriate truncation of the number of eigenspectra in reconstructing a quasar spectrum can in principle lead to an un - absorbed continuum .",
    "we find evolution of the small bump by the cross - redshift kl transforms , in agreement with the quasars from the large bright quasar survey @xcite and in other independent work @xcite .",
    "the baldwin effect is detected in the cross - luminosity kl transforms , as well as from the mean qso spectra derived for different luminosities .",
    "one implication of these redshift and luminosity effects is that they have to be accounted for in the spectral classification of quasars , consistent with our finding from the commonality analysis .",
    "the high quality of the data allows us to obtain quasar eigenspectra which are generic enough to study spectral properties . despite the presence of diverse quasar properties such as different continuum slopes and shapes , and",
    "various emission line features known for several decades , our analysis shows that there are unambiguous correlations among various broad emission lines and with continua in different windows .",
    "a second paper is being prepared to address the classifications of the dr1 quasars in greater detail .",
    "one interesting direction is to relate the current eigenspectra approach to the radio properties of the quasars , so that further discriminations of intrinsic and extrinsic properties can be achieved , for example , the orientation effects on the observed spectra ( e.g. , richards et  al .",
    "another application currently being addressed is the removal of host - galaxy components from the sdss quasar spectra .",
    "in addition , the cross - projections can also be applied to study future larger samples of quasars ( e.g. , @xmath94 100,000 at the completion of the sdss ) for possibly new evolution and luminosity effects .",
