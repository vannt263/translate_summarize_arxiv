    "wave propagation in disordered media and its consequences to the disorder induced localization , or anderson localization @xcite have been studied in detail for electron ( quantum ) waves @xcite , as well as for light ( classical ) waves @xcite for last four decades .",
    "we have discussed several aspects of transport and localization for 1d electronic systems in our previous paper @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with an interesting aspect of the application of the anderson localization to enhance the coherent light amplification in a coherently amplifying disordered medium .",
    "due to the bosonic nature of the light quanta , there is possibility of coherent amplification or coherent absorption(attenuation ) for light ; and these possibilities are absent for electronic(fermionic ) case .",
    "background to study this problem comes from the following two facts : ( 1 ) coherent amplification in an coherently amplifying medium is a non conserving scattering process where temporal phase coherence of a wave is preserved despite amplification and ( 2 ) coherent back scattering ( cbs ) in a disordered media is the main cause of weak and strong localization will not be affected with additional presence of a coherently amplifying medium due to the persistence of phase coherence of the interfering waves .",
    "the preservation of the cbs , hence the localization , despite amplification can bring the interesting possibility of obtaining synergitic enhancement of wave amplification , or laser action without mirrors due to the confinement by the anderson localization , in an optically pumped laser active disordered media . in our previous short paper @xcite",
    "such possibility was shown theoretically for 1d amplifying disordered media . _",
    "our calculation @xcite lead to an important result that in the presence of amplification in a disordered optical medium , the anderson localization enhances the coherent amplification .",
    "_ in fact , recent experiments @xcite support aspects of the lasing action , or more precisely , enhanced amplification of spontaneous emission ( ase ) , in an amplifying and strongly scattering medium without an external resonant cavity .",
    "there is current interest to see the affect of disorder on coherent amplification / absorption in different disorder regimes . in this detailed paper",
    "we have discussed the possible background and probable several physical aspects of the problem of coherent light amplification using the anderson localization and a detailed study of the 1d amplifying / absorbing disordered medium .",
    "it is now well known that in 1d and 2d all states of a wave are localized for both electronic and optical disordered systems @xcite .",
    "this motivate one to study synergetic effect of amplification and localization for lower dimensions .",
    "we study analytically and numerically , the probability distribution of the reflection coefficient(@xmath0 ) and phase ( @xmath1 ) of the complex amplitude reflection coefficient ( @xmath2 ) of a wave reflected from a one - dimensional coherently absorbing / attenuating disordered medium for a gaussian white - noise potential for different lengths of the sample , with different strengths of disorder , and with different active ( gain or loss ) parameter values .",
    "we set up a general framework to study 1d coherently amplifying / absorbing disordered media and discuss the context of physical realization for both optical and electronic cases .",
    "coherent amplification we mean mainly is due to the stimulated emission of radiation which can only be applicable to an optical ( bosonic ) case and has no electronic counterpart .",
    "coherent absorption can have physical situation in both the optical and the electronic cases  for the electronic(fermionic ) case it signifies effectively the incoherent part of the electron wave function caused by inelastic scattering .",
    "we consider here mainly the 1d helmholtz equation , where the coherent ( linear ) amplification / absorption is modeled by adding a constant imaginary part to the real potential .",
    "we derive first a langevin equation for the complex amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath3 and then the fokker - planck equation in the @xmath4-space for evolution with the length of the sample for different parameter values : ( 1 ) disorder strength , and ( 2 ) active parameter .",
    "we discuss the appropriate physical situations for both the cases , i.e. , absorption and amplification .",
    "modeling amplification / absorption by a complex potential , however , always gives a reflection part due to the mismatch between the real and the imaginary potentials .",
    "we discuss these issues in detail .",
    "we also derive a langevin equation and then the fp equation by a phenomenological modeling where absorption has no concomitant reflection part .",
    "we also have discussed recent experimental and theoretical works of others on coherent amplification / absorption .",
    "the main cause of the weak and the strong localization in a disordered medium is coherent - back - scattering ( cbs ) @xcite . in the weakly localized regime , cbs is the correction to the classical transport , and in the strongly localized regime cbs is the dominant effect . in the presence of coherent amplification / attenuation , the partial wave amplitudes get amplified / attenuated in the same way along the echo ( i.e. , time - reversed ) paths when they meet at the starting point @xmath5 as shown in fig.[ppfig1 ] , i.e. , the phase is not lost due to the coherent nature of the amplification , or attenuation which is relevant to the stimulated emission of radiation , or the coherent ( stochastic ) absorption .",
    "let now briefly describe disordered coherently amplifying / absorbing media relevant to this problem .",
    "by coherently amplifying media we mean stimulated emission of radiation in a lasing medium . here , we show that the presence of localization in a highly scattering medium , when the medium is also an active amplifying one , can the amplification .",
    "there is the possibility of using anderson localization as a `` non - resonant feedback '' mechanism for lasing action .",
    "recent experiments which show self - sustaining lasing action in an optically amplifying and highly scattering medium , without an external cavity , support these aspects which we will discuss in later section .",
    "although the real situation of stimulated radiation in a lasing medium involves non - linear amplification , for the sake of simplicity we will consider a linear amplifying medium only and discuss enhanced amplification by the disorder induced confinement . by the linear medium here we mean the refractive index being independent of the light intensity .",
    "light localization is an interesting and clean problem due to the fact that the energy of the photon is high and no effect of temperature and photons are noninteracting .",
    "there are , however , problems in localizing light @xcite .",
    "this is because the `` effective potential '' of a dielectric medium depends on the incoming wave energy , or the wavelength ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the problem is to satisfy the mott - ioffe - regel ( mir ) @xcite criterion for the localization which is essential for any wave localization .",
    "the mir criterion for the localization demands that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wave number of the incident wave and @xmath9 is the elastic ( coherent ) scattering mean free path for transport as shown in fig.[locwindow ] . for longer wavelengths , or in the low energy limit of the incident wave , scattering is dominated by the rayleigh scattering , @xmath10 , for a @xmath11 dimensional scatterer . in the other extreme limit of high frequency , or short wave length , the system is almost transparent ( non - scattering ) to the incoming wave for wave lengths smaller than the correlation length of the random potential when the response of the system is that of geometrical optics .",
    "localization is , thus , missed in both the wave length limits , the large as well as the small . while in 1d and 2d",
    "all states are localized for arbitrary weak disorder , there is a very wide localization window where the localization length is very large . in 3d",
    "there may be a small free - photon localization window for intermediate wavelengths . here",
    "the mir criterion can be satisfied in an indirect way by first creating a pseudo - band gap by fulfilling the bragg condition @xmath12 through a periodic lattice of dielectric medium and then deliberately introducing a weak disorder to the system @xcite .",
    "it was shown for 3d that in such systems , the density of states near the band gap correspond to localized states .",
    "* what will happen to coherent light amplification in an amplifying ( active ) medium , when the light modes are already disorder - localized in that medium ? * + for 1d and 2d all modes are localized for light wave and one can see the direct affect of localization on coherent amplification / absorption . in 3d there is a small localization window and possibility of a physical situation can be as follows .",
    "suppose the wavelength @xmath13 of a lasing light lies within the localization window .",
    "a typical localization window for 3d is shown in fig.[locwindow ] .",
    "now , consider a three - level lasing scheme as shown in fig.[proposal ] . for lasing action electrons have to be pumped first from the ground level to the upper excited levels .",
    "the transitions from the excited level to the intermediate meta - stable level are arranged to be non - radiative . lasing action occurs between the meta - stable and the ground states .",
    "now it is possible to arrange such that the shorter pumping wavelength @xmath14 that excites electrons from the ground state to the upper excited states lies within the delocalized geometric - optical regime , while the meta - stable to the ground state radiation wave length , i.e. the lasing wavelength @xmath13 , lies within the localization window .",
    "then , the question is how the localization and the coherent amplification synergetically lead to enhanced amplification . also , how does the lasing wavelength get selected , if at all in the absence of a resonant cavity structure providing the feedback .      in a typical amplifying medium",
    ", a wave has to traverse a long path - length for amplification , by stimulated emission .",
    "simultaneously , the wave may lose its energy by other loss mechanisms like non - radiative dissipation , escape out of the system etc .. the wave requires a positive feedback to gain a higher amplification .",
    "such a feedback can be given in several ways .",
    "in the case of resonant feedback , the laser active material is kept inside a resonant cavity @xcite , which is generally made of two parallel mirrors as shown in fig.[fabry ] .",
    "stimulated emission has a typical width for its intensity distribution ( gain profile ) over the wavelengths .",
    "resonant cavity is made by matching the spacing between the two mirrors such that it can give positive feedback selectively to a set wavelengths that `` fit '' into the cavity .",
    "given a cavity of length @xmath15 , we will get the resonant positive feedback , if @xmath16 is satisfied , where @xmath17 is an integer . the wavelength which satisfies the above resonance condition will survive , because only this wavelength will overcome the energy losses in the medium through multiple passes .",
    "intensity for the rest of the wavelengths will die down as there is no feedback to them to compensate for the loss in the medium .",
    "the line - width of the laser light will now be determined by the cavity  q(quality)-factor .",
    "it is much narrower than the width of the gain profile of the laser material .",
    "it is also narrower than the widths of the cavity resonances .",
    "it is in fact `` gain - narrowed '' .",
    "a distributed `` gain '' to a wave propagating in an amplifying medium can be given to it in its forward journey ( single pass ) also , if it moves over a sufficiently long path length as shown in fig.[gain]a .",
    "an example of this type of medium is to be found commonly in our galaxy .",
    "astrophysical `` maser '' @xcite , like the @xmath18 maser in our galaxy gets feedback by this mechanism .",
    "the gain produces its own spectral narrowing without any resonant structures . in order to see how this happens , note that the medium amplification has a gain profile with respect to the wavelength . a starting intensity profile , which also has a distribution over the wavelengths , passing trough the amplifying medium is modulated by the gain profile . in the process of a long - length journey , only the prominent peak of the initial intensity profile will be effectively amplified .",
    "thus , let @xmath19 be the starting intensity distribution of a stimulated radiation and @xmath20 be the gain profile of the medium .",
    "after @xmath21 successive coherently amplifying encounters , the intensity distribution will be amplified iteratively as :    @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 ......... @xmath25 .",
    "+ the latter would tend to a single delta - function as @xmath26 , even when the initial profile @xmath19 is broad , but singly peaked .",
    "fig.[gain]b shows a schematic typical `` gain narrowing '' by such a `` feed - forward '' mechanism .",
    "`` feed - forward '' is a better nomenclature here than `` feedback '' .",
    "a variation on the above feed - forward theme is readily realized in a diffusing , amplifying medium where random multiple scattering ( turbidity ) can enhance the path length traversed by light ( or increase its residence time ) before emerging out of the amplifying medium .",
    "thus if @xmath27 is gain length for the pure amplifying medium ( i.e. , the length over which the intensity is amplified by a factor @xmath28 ) , and @xmath9 is the transport mean free path for diffusion due to scattering , then for the three - dimensional sample size @xmath29 , the gain exceeds the loss at the boundaries and self - sustaining emission  super radiance(sr )  can result .",
    "there is really no feed - back loop here and hence no true laser action . what one has is the amplification of uncorrelated spontaneous emission ( ase ) .",
    "it does , however , show gain narrowing as discussed above .",
    "we are trying to explore the possibility of using the anderson localized states for a feedback mechanism in the disordered lasing media .",
    "when a wave passes through a disordered amplifying medium it undergoes coherent multiple scattering .",
    "it is reasonable to think that due to the multiple scattering processes a wave can get amplified before it escapes from the system . in a strong disordered media ,",
    "coherent back scattering ensures the wave to bring back to its starting point .",
    "now the questions are : ( a ) is this amplification sufficient to overcome the loss in the system , ( b ) can we use the system ( amplifying medium with disorder ) as a pure optical amplifier , and ( c ) is there a mechanism for wavelength selection .",
    "the answers to ( a ) and ( b ) seem to be yes , as supported by recent theories and experiments and answer to ( c ) is still unknown .",
    "recent series of experiments by lawandy _ et .",
    "@xcite have shown evidence for self - sustaining lasing action in an amplifying , optical scattering medium . though it seems more like amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed on rhodeamine 640 perchlorate laser dye , dissolved in methanol , as an active medium .",
    "colloidal suspension of @xmath30 nanoparticles ( coated with @xmath31 ) in the active methanol solution was used as the optical scattering random medium .",
    "the emission from such a system was found to exhibit multi - mode laser oscillations in the absence of any external resonant cavity . with no @xmath30 ( no strong disorder ) in the active solution , there was no lasing action from the pure laser active dye dissolved in methanol .",
    "very recent experiment by wiersma _ et .",
    "@xcite shows enhancement of amplification due to coherent back scattering from an coherently amplifying optical disordered solid state medium .",
    "this experiment is more relevant to our calculation , which deals with amplification in a medium due to localization .",
    "these experiments motivate one to study the phenomenon of amplification - enhancement by disorder in more detail .",
    "the model we are going to consider is for the case of a pure 1d random amplifying medium .",
    "a physical realization may be a single longitudinal - mode optical fiber doped with a laser active material ( @xmath32 , say ) and disordered intentionally .",
    "there have been recent interest in the role of absorption on localization , and on the different length scales in the problem in the presence of absorption . for the bosonic case , like light etc .",
    ", a coherent state ( e.g. a laser beam ) is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator .",
    "removal of a photon(absorption ) does not destroy the phase coherence .",
    "fermions can not be annihilated in the context we are considering here . for the fermionic case , the physical picturization of the absorption will be some kind of inelastic process ( like scattering by phonons ) , where electrons lose its partial temporal phase memory .",
    "this type of absorption is called _",
    "stochastic absorption_. absorption can be of an other type also , the so called deterministic absorption . in this case , particles are shut out by a chopper from its beam path .",
    "it has been shown that the stochastic absorption retains more coherence than the deterministic absorption while absorbing ( removing ) the same amount of particles @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite have shown that the absorption in case of light wave does not give any cut - off length scale for the localization problem .",
    "if a system is in the localized state , absorption will not kill the localization to make the system again diffusive . a sharp mobility edge exist even in the presence of significant absorption in 3d .",
    "adding a constant imaginary part with the proper sign to the real potential of the maxwell / schrdinger wave can model the linear coherent amplification / absorption .",
    "the maxwell equation can be transformed to the schrdinger equation where the effective potential depends on the frequency of the incoming wave .",
    "also , both the maxwell and the schrdinger equations can be transformed to the helmholtz equation .    adding a constant imaginary potential @xmath33 to the original real potential @xmath34 , the schrdinger equation becomes : @xmath35   \\psi \\ , = k^2 \\psi \\quad , \\label{sceq}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 .",

    "formally , we will consider 1d one - channel helmholtz equation only , and will specify at the proper place which situation is appropriate , optical or electronic .",
    "it has been pointed out by rubio and kumar @xcite that modeling absorption by complex potential will always give a concomitant reflection .",
    "increasing the strength of the complex potential will not increase the absorption .",
    "there is a competition between the amplification / absorption and the reflection .",
    "for very high absorption , the system may try to act as a perfect reflector .",
    "later we present a detailed analysis for the modeling of absorption by `` fake '' , or `` side '' , channels obviating the need for a complex potential .",

    "that is , let us start with the @xmath125 scatterers , and add one more scatterer to the right to make up the n+1 scatterers .",
    "now , we want to see the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath130 .",
    "that is , let there be a delta - function potential scatterer between @xmath15 and @xmath129 , positioned at the point @xmath131 , that can be considered as the effective scatterer due to the extra added scatterers for length @xmath132 . for @xmath133",

    "summing all the processes of direct and multiple reflections and transmissions , on the right side of the sample of length @xmath15 , with the effective delta potential at @xmath152 , one gets , @xmath153 summing the above geometric series , substituting the values of @xmath72 and @xmath154 , and taking the continuum limit for l , one gets from eq.[2.24 ] , the langevin equation : @xmath155 with the initial condition @xmath156 for @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the absorbing parameter .",
    "this is not quite the same as the eq(4.4 ) obtained by introducing an imaginary potential .",
    "it turns out , however , this langevin equation gives same results in the regime of weak disorder but differs qualitatively in the regime of strong disorder .",
