    "rank data has recently generated a considerable interest within the machine learning community , as evidenced in ranking labels @xcite and ranking data instances @xcite .",
    "the problem is often cast as generating a list of objects ( e.g. , labels , documents ) which are arranged in decreasing order of relevance with respect to some query ( e.g. , input features , keywords ) .",
    "the treatment effectively ignores the grouping property of compatible objects @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when some objects are likely to be grouped with some others in certain ways .",
    "for example , a grocery basket is likely to contain a variety of goods which are complementary for household needs and at the same time , satisfy weekly budget constraints .",
    "likewise , a set of movies are likely to given the same quality rating according to a particular user . in these situations , it is better to consider ranking groups instead of individual objects . it is beneficial not only when we need to recommend a subset ( as in the case of grocery shopping ) , but also when we just want to produce a ranked list ( as in the case of watching movies ) because we would better exploit the compatibility among grouped items .",
    "this poses a question of how to group individual objects into subsets given a list of all possible objects .",
    "unlike the situation when the subsets are pre - defined and fixed ( e.g. , sport teams in a particular season ) , here we need to explore the space of set partitioning and ordering simultaneously . in the grocery example",
    "we need to partition the stocks in the store into baskets and then rank them with respect to their utilities ; and in the movie rating example we group movies in the same quality - package and then rank these groups according to their given ratings .",
    "the situation is somewhat related to multilabel learning , where our goal is to produce a subset of labels out of many for a given input , but it is inherently more complicated : not only we need to produce all subsets , but also to rank them .",
    "this paper introduces a probabilistic model for this type of situations , i.e. , we want to learn the statistical patterns from which a set of objects is partitioned and ordered , and to compute the probability of any scheme of partitioning and ordering .",
    "in particular , the model imposes a log - linear distribution over the joint events of partitioning and ordering .",
    "it turns out , however , that the state - space is prohibitively large : if the space of complete ranking has the complexity of @xmath3 for @xmath2 objects , then the space of partitioning a set and ordering approaches @xmath1 in size as @xmath2 approaches infinity @xcite .",
    "clearly , the latter grows much faster than the former by an exponential factor of @xmath4 . to manage the exploration of this space",
    ", we design a ` split - and - merge ` metropolis - hastings procedure which iteratively visits all possible ways of partitioning and ordering .",
    "the procedure randomly alternates between the ` split ` move , where a subset is split into two consecutive parts , and the ` merge ` move , where two consecutive subsets are merged .",
    "the proposed model is termed ordered sets model ( @xmath5 ) .    to discover hidden aspects in ordered sets ( e.g. , latent aspects that capture the taste of a user in his or her movie genre ) ,",
    "we further introduce binary latent variables in a fashion similar to that of restricted boltzmann machines ( rbms ) @xcite .",
    "the posteriors of hidden units given the visible rank data can be used as a vectorial representation of the data - this can be handy in tasks such as computing distance measures or visualisation .",
    "this results in a new model called latent @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we show how the proposed latent @xmath5 can be applied for collaborative filtering , e.g. , when we need to take seen grouped item ratings as input and produce a ranked list of unseen item for each user .",
    "we then demonstrate and evaluate our model on large - scale public datasets .",
    "the experiments show that our approach is competitive against several state - of - the - art methods .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . section  [ sec : ordered - set - log - linear ] presents the log - linear model over ordered sets ( @xmath5 ) together with our main contribution ",
    "the ` split - and - merge ` procedure .",
    "section  [ sec : introducing - latent - variables ] introduces latent @xmath5 , which extends the @xmath5 to incorporate latent variables in the form of a set of binary factors .",
    "an application of the proposed latent @xmath5 for collaborative filtering is described in section  [ sec : application - in - collaborative ] .",
    "related work is reviewed in the next section , followed by the conclusions .",

    "this work is closely related to the emerging concept of _ preferences over sets _ in ai @xcite and in social choice and utility theories @xcite .",
    "however , most existing work has focused on representing preferences and computing the optimal set under preference constraints @xcite .",
    "these differ from our goals to model a distribution over all possible set orderings and to learn from example orderings .",
    "learning from expressed preferences has been studied intensively in ai and machine learning , but they are often limited to pairwise preferences or complete ordering @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there has been very little work on learning from ordered sets @xcite .",
    "the most recent and closest to our is the pmop which models ordered sets as a locally normalised _",
    "high - order markov chain _ @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with our setting which involves a globally normalised log - linear solution .",
    "note that since the high - order markov chain involves all previously ranked subsets , while our osm involves pairwise comparisons , the former is not a special case of ours .",
    "our additional contribution is that we model the space of partitioning and ordering directly and offer sampling tools to explore the space .",
    "this ease of inference is not readily available for the pmop .",
    "finally , our solution easily leads to the introduction of latent variables , while their approach lacks that capacity .",
    "our ` split - and - merge ` sampling procedure bears some similarity to the one proposed in @xcite for mixture assignment .",
    "the main difference is that we need to handle the extra orderings between partitions , while it is assumed to be exchangeable in @xcite .",
    "this causes a subtle difference in generating proposal moves .",
    "likewise , a similar method is employed in @xcite for mapping a set of observations into a set of landmarks , but again , ranking is not considered .    with respect to collaborative ranking , there has been work focusing on producing a set of items instead of just ranking individual ones @xcite . these can be considered as a special case of @xmath5 where there are only two subsets ( those selected and the rest ) .",
    "we have introduced a latent variable approach to modelling ranked groups . _ _ our main contribution is an efficient ` split - and - merge ` mcmc inference procedure that can effectively explore the hyper - exponential state - space . _",
    "_ we demonstrate how the proposed model can be useful in collaborative filtering .",
    "the empirical results suggest that proposed model is competitive against state - of - the - art rivals on a number of large - scale collaborative filtering datasets .",
