    "in recent years , single - layer graphene has received much attention due to its two dimensionality , dirac - like energy spectrum and outstanding spin - coherence properties.@xcite specifically , the hyperfine interaction and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) are considerably weak,@xcite suggesting a long spin relaxation time ( srt ) in single - layer graphene .",
    "this long srt makes single - layer graphene a promising candidate for spintronic application .",
    "so far , a number of experiments on spin relaxation have been carried out , with the srts being orders of magnitude shorter than theoretical prediction.@xcite this pronounced discrepancy has provoked many investigations on the extrinsic effects of spin relaxation such as adatoms,@xcite curvature,@xcite substrate effects@xcite and contacts.@xcite consisting of two layer graphene , bilayer graphene ( blg ) also possesses good spin - coherence properties.@xcite additionally , in contrast to single - layer graphene , blg has a tunable gap caused by an out - of - plane electric field,@xcite which can be used to turn on or off the electronic transport .",
    "in addition , in the absence of space inversion symmetry , the intrinsic soc in the pseudospin space of blg provides an out - of - plane effective magnetic field near the dirac points whereas the intrinsic soc of single - layer graphene only induces a shift of the energy spectrum.@xcite moreover , the electron - phonon coupling becomes more complex in blg due to the existence of more phonon modes.@xcite so far , some efforts have been made to investigate the intravalley electron - phonon coupling.@xcite specifically , the intravalley electron - acoustic ( ac ) phonon coupling has been calculated by viljas and heikkil@xcite with the continuum theory and also by borysenko _",
    "et al._@xcite from first principles . to explore the intravalley electron - optical ( op ) phonon coupling , the tight - binding model , density functional theory and first principles approach are employed by viljas and heikkil,@xcite cappelluti _",
    "et al._@xcite and borysenko _",
    "et al._,@xcite respectively .",
    "however , the intervalley electron - phonon coupling , which has been shown to play an important role in spin relaxation in rippled single - layer graphene,@xcite has not been reported in the previous literature .",
    "all these intriguing features make blg an attractive material for investigation .",
    "very recently , some attention has been devoted to the spin relaxation in blg.@xcite experimentally , the srts of blg on sio@xmath0 substrate@xcite or in freely suspended blg@xcite are reported to be of the order of @xmath1-@xmath2ns . both yang _ et al._@xcite and han and kawakami@xcite measured the temperature and carrier dependences of the srt .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that the srt is weakly dependent on temperature .",
    "however , han and kawakami@xcite reported a marked decrease of the srt with the increase of the temperature .",
    "as for the carrier density dependence , the decrease of the srt with increasing carrier density at low temperature is reported in both experiments . however , at room temperature , yang _",
    "et al._@xcite observed an increase of the srt with increasing density whereas the srt measured by han and kawakami@xcite exhibits a marginal density dependence .",
    "in addition , yang _",
    "et al._@xcite also showed that the srt scales inversely with the mobility at both room and low temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the above two experiments based on the micromechanically exfoliated blg samples , avsar _",
    "et al._@xcite carried out the experiment in chemical vapor deposition grown blg . the carrier density and temperature dependences of the srt measured are comparable to the ones by yang _",
    "et al._@xcite both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "motivated by these experiments , diez and burkard@xcite calculated the electron spin relaxation due to the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite with only the long - range electron - impurity scattering included in blg .",
    "they claimed to obtain a good agreement with the experimental data of yang _",
    "et al._.@xcite it is noted that the effective soc ( referred to as the spin - orbit field in ref .  ) used in their calculation is induced by an interlayer bias voltage together with the intrinsic soc in the pseudospin space.@xcite however , the intrinsic soc in the pseudospin space becomes incomplete in the presence of the interlayer bias since the interlayer bias breaks the space inversion symmetry and leads to additional extrinsic soc terms in the pseudospin space.@xcite also even with only the intrinsic soc in the pseudospin space in their calculation , they overlooked the out - of - plane component of the effective soc .",
    "as will be shown later , the leading term of this component leads to a zeeman - like term in the two valleys and makes a dominant contribution to the in - plane spin relaxation .",
    "moreover , they neglected the electron - phonon and electron - electron coulomb scatterings .",
    "in fact , the electron - electron coulomb scattering has been demonstrated to be very important for the spin relaxation in semiconductor systems@xcite and also single - layer graphene at high temperature.@xcite the electron - phonon scattering has also been shown to play an important role in spin relaxation in both semiconductors@xcite and single - layer graphene@xcite at high temperature .",

    "we investigate the electron spin relaxation due to the dp mechanism in blg with only the lowest conduction band being relevant by the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach.@xcite the soc of the lowest conduction band near the dirac points @xmath3 is constructed from the symmetry group @xmath4 in the presence of an out - of - plane electric field.@xcite its three components",
