    "relativistic @xmath6-symbol _ , whose underlying graph is the complete graph of @xmath14 vertices .",
    "in the course of the first explicit computations of relativistic @xmath6-symbols @xcite , it was observed that they always evaluate to non - negative real numbers , up to some signs which cancel when one calculates the product of @xmath6-symbols over all four - simplices of a closed manifold  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we generalize the result of  @xcite to relativistic spin networks on a large class of graphs . while  @xcite has established the positivity of the barrett ",
    "crane amplitudes for the case of @xmath6-symbols ,  for five - valent vertices and therefore for a model which is defined on the two - complex dual to a triangulation , our generalization extends this result to the barrett  crane model defined on generic two - complexes . in addition ,",
    "we present a formulation in which unnecessary signs are avoided right from the beginning and which allows us to generalize the result to @xmath1-symmetric spin networks whose edges are labeled by representations of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes a representation of @xmath0 , and whose intertwiners are certain generalizations of the barrett  crane intertwiner .",
    "the key idea of our proof is to use a canonical description for the intertwiners in terms of their integral presentation .",
    "a main technical problem in the study of spin networks is that one needs good conventions in order to define the intertwiners ,  some clebsch  gordan coefficients , at the vertices . for a single intertwiner",
    ", however , there is no canonical definition known .",
    "writing down clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients rather requires the choice of bases for the representation spaces , and the resulting expressions do depend on these choices .",
    "a typical example is a three - valent vertex of an @xmath13-spin network whose edges are labeled by irreducible representations .",
    "let @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the irreducible representations of @xmath17 .",
    "then the dimension of the space of compatible intertwiners is @xmath18 the space of intertwiners is at most one - dimensional , but this still does not fix the intertwiner . given any choice of normalization , there will still be signs appearing when one exchanges two of the three tensor factors .",
    "this can be seen most easily in the special case @xmath19 in which the one - dimensional trivial representation is contained in the totally antisymmetric subspace of @xmath20 .",
    "the main difficulty of the positivity proof are these signs which one has to keep track of .",
    "the positivity proof that has been found for products of @xmath6-symbols  @xcite already indicates that it is necessary to consider pairs of these intertwiners , chosen carefully so that these signs cancel .",
    "the strategy of the present article is to concentrate on canonical objects which can be defined without any choices .",
    "already in the study of the duality transformation for non - abelian lattice gauge theory  @xcite , it was noticed that an important role is played by a canonically defined object , the intertwiner arising from the integration over the symmetry group @xmath0 acting on a tensor product of representations , equation   below , which gives rise to pairs of intertwiners , called @xmath21 in   below , whose _ relative _ normalization is canonically fixed .",
    "this leads automatically to the desired cancellation of signs .",
    "the evaluated spin networks whose positivity we wish to prove , take in general values in @xmath22 and can be written as traces of suitable linear maps . at the technical level ,",
    "the key idea of the proof is to defer the calculation of the traces to a later stage and to study the linear maps instead .",
    "in fact , many of these linear maps are actually _ positive _ ,  it is not only their trace that is positive , but rather the individual summands of the trace . by making these stronger conditions explicit in the calculations , we are able to construct an infinite family of positive linear maps by induction .",
    "their traces will then provide the evaluated spin networks and establish their positivity .",
    "the proof is elementary and purely algebraic except for the input that orthogonal projectors are positive .",
    "going beyond the study of relativistic spin networks , it is tempting to conjecture that all spin networks that can be written down using only group integrations and index contractions , are positive .",
    "we show by counterexample that this stronger conjecture is not true .",
