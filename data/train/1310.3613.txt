    "during the last decade , the development of non - volatile electronic memories based on the resistive switching ( rs ) effect in transition metal oxides made a huge progress , becoming one of the promising candidates to substitute the standard technologies in a near future .",
    "rs refers to the reversible change of the resistance of a nanometer - sized media by the application of electrical pulses @xcite .",
    "though immediately after the discovery of the reversible rs effect in transition metal oxides its application for multi - level cell memories ( mlc ) was envisioned @xcite , reports so far chiefly focused on single - level cell ( slc ) devices @xcite . unlike slc , which can only store one - bit per cell , mlc memories may store multiple bits in a single cell @xcite . mlcs of up to 4 bits ( 16 levels ) are currently available based in both , standard flash @xcite and phase - change @xcite technologies .         in an @xmath0-bit rs - based mlc memory , one has to encode the @xmath1 memory levels as distinct resistance states .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 memory states can be identified with each one of the consecutive and adjacent resistance bins of width @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . to store the @xmath4 memory state",
    "the device has to be set to the corresponding bin , ie @xmath5 .",
    "the requirement of non - volatility implies that the value should remain within that bin , even after the input is disconnected or the memory state is read out . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] we plot data of a random sequence of stored memory states in our implementation of a 64-level ( 6-bit ) mlc . for practical convenience resistance levels",
    "are translated into voltage levels by a fixed bias current .",
    "the central component of the mlc is a rs device of a resistance @xmath6 , whose magnitude can be changed by application of a current pulse @xmath7 .",
    "the resistance change depends on @xmath7 through a highly non - trivial function @xmath8 ; @xmath9 the function @xmath8 is usually unknown , however , an important general requirement for non - volatile memory applications using rs is that @xmath10 for currents below a given threshold .",
    "this allows to sense ( ie , read - out ) a stored memory state , ie the so called remnant resistance @xmath11 , injecting a bias current @xmath12 without modifying the stored information .",
    "thus , @xmath13 , @xmath12 .",
    "a two level memory can be simply implemented by pulsing a rs - device strongly with opposite polarities and sensing the corresponding high and low @xmath6 states with a weak bias current .",
    "however , the previous observation of a current threshold has an important consequence for the implementation of mlc memories .",
    "in fact , in order to implement an mlc one should be able to tune the value of @xmath11 to any desired value .",
    "the better the control on this tuning , the better the ability to define the bins and a larger number of bits could be coded in the mlc . in principle , a perfect knowledge of the function @xmath8 should allow for this , but in practice the function is not known .",
    "yet , any reasonable form of @xmath8 would allow to tune any arbitrary memory state by applying a sequence of pulses of decreasing intensity , following a simple zero - finding algorithm as in standard control circuit .",
    "nevertheless , the requirement of a threshold current difficult the fine tuning , as small corrections beneath @xmath14 have no effect . in practice , the dead - zone introduced by relatively large values of @xmath14",
    "prevents a straightforward implementation of rs - device as mlc memories with a large number of levels .",
    "below we shall demonstrate how this conceptual problem can be overcome , and exhibit the implementation of a 64-level mlc .",
    ", and a write state where current pulses are applied in order to cancel the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". when wr is deactivated , @xmath7 is force to zero . ]",
    "we adopt a manganite - based rs - device , made by depositing silver contacts on a sintered pellet of la@xmath17pr@xmath18ca@xmath19mno@xmath20 ( lpcmo ) @xcite .",
    "a rs - device is defined between the pulsed ag / lpcmo and a second non - pulsed contact . a third electrode ( earth )",
    "is required in a minimal 3-contact configuration setup .",
    "a requirement for our mlc is that the rs - device operates in bipolar rs mode @xcite , ie , depending on the pulse polarity the remnant resistance either increases or decreases .",
    "it is now well established that the mechanism behind bipolar rs is the redistribution of oxygen vacancies , within the nanometer - scale region of the sample in contact with the electrodes @xcite . in the case of lpcmo",
    ", the oxygen vacancies significantly increase its resistivity because the electrical transport relies on the double - exchange mechanism mediated by the oxygen atoms @xcite .",
    "pulsing an electrical current trough the contact will produce a large electric field at the interface due to the high resistivity of the ag / lpcmo schottky barrier .",
    "if the pulse is strong enough , it will enable the migration oxygen ions across the barrier , modifying the concentration of vacancies and , hence , changing the interface resistance .",
    "the ionic migration remains always near the interface and does not penetrate deep into the bulk , since the much larger conductivity there prevents the development of high electric fields .",
    "thus , the rs effect remains confined to a nanometer - sized region near the interface , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ phys ] .",
    "we now introduce a practical implementation of an rs - based mlc that produced the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] .",
    "we used an ag / lpcmo interface and off - the - shelf electronic components .",
    "the block diagram of the concept is presented in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] and the schematics and technical details are included in the appendix .",
    "we envisage an implementation of an rs - based mlc memory chip where the storage core is a set of many rs - units with a single common control circuit .",
    "the common control would set each of the individual rs - units , one at a time , thus resembling the concept of the refresh logic circuit in the drams . in this work",
    "we demonstrate the implementation of the control circuit with a single rs memory unit .",
    "key to our mlc implementation is to adopt a discrete - time algorithm that overcomes the problems discussed above @xcite , and which we describe next .",
    "the required memory state @xmath21 is coded in terms of a @xmath15 , while @xmath16 indicates the actual stored value ( fig .",
    "the system iteratively applies pulses @xmath7 of a strength that is an estimate of the required value to set the target state @xmath15 , eventually converging to it .",
    "this discrete - time feedback loop continuously cycles between 2 stages ; probe and correct . in probe stage",
    "the switch connects the rs - device to the current source @xmath22 in order to sense the remnant resistance . in the correct stage",
    ", the switch connects the rs - device to a pulse generator that applies a corrective pulse @xmath7 , of a strength that is obtained from the difference between the delayed @xmath16 and the target value @xmath15 as follows , @xmath23=k_{p}\\,e\\left[k\\right]+k_{i}\\,\\sum_{i=0}^{k}e\\left[i\\right],\\label{eq : pi}\\ ] ] where the error signal @xmath24=v_{out}\\left[k-1\\right]-v_{in}\\left[k\\right]$ ] is the change required in the output voltage and @xmath25:=i_{pulse}\\left(k\\ , f_{{\\rm clk}}^{-1}\\right)$ ] , being @xmath26 the frequency of the system clock and @xmath27 an integer . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generic proportional and integral constants respectively with @xmath30 unit , being @xmath31 and @xmath32 the electric current and voltage units .",
    "the first term of the equation represents a proportional estimator . the second term prevents the system to get stuck in a condition where @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , for low @xmath24 $ ] a pulse of strength @xmath34 $ ] would lay below the threshold , thus not producing any further change in the state of the system .",
    "the magnitude of the second term linearly increases in time , thus making @xmath7 to eventually overcome the threshold and correct the output voltage in the desired direction .    notice that even if this approach resembles a standard proportional - integral ( pi ) control loop with dead - zone , there are substantial differences .",
    "first , the remnant resistance reading and the correcting pulse application occur at different times .",
    "this requires the addition of the continuously commuting switch .",
    "second , we also needed the introduction of a delay , implemented as a sample and hold circuit , as is required for the feedback path . these differences and",
    "the strong non - linearity in @xmath8 makes the stability analysis of this approach ( which also depends on specific values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) a significant issue that we describe below .",

    "[ results ] .",
    "we emphasize that the relatively slow operation speed of our memory mlc would be dramatically improved upon device miniaturization and integration . for simplicity , we sampled a random subset of 16 out of 64 different voltages uniformly distributed along the operative range ( fig .",

    "each write and read cycle had a duration of 13 seconds .",
    "in the first 5 s the wr signal was active and a memory value was set . after a memory value was set , we observed a small relaxation of @xmath16 with time constant of @xmath831.6 s. the value of @xmath16 remained essentially stable afterwards .",
    "thus , for the sake of performing a large number measurements , we only monitored the memory retentivity during the 5 time - constants ( ie , 8 seconds ) that immediately followed the set . within that period ,",
    "the wr signal was inactive , and the memory state stored in @xmath16 was probed every 0.1 s ( ie , the memory was read out 80 times ) .",
    "continuously sampled at 10 reading per second . during the readings indicated with the red bars the signal wr was active ;",
    "the output value accurately follows the sequence of input values that is randomly chosen on the grid . during the readings indicated with blue bars ,",
    "no pulses were applied to the rs - device , resulting in a drift .",
    "( b ) histogram of the last read value of the memory in each cycle ( ie , last value of blue sections ) .",
    "the horizontal bars denote the @xmath84 intervals corresponding to a 16 , 32 and 64 level devices .",
    "the location of the bars are chosen so to minimize the error probability ( ie , area of histogram outside the interval ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ results](b ) we present the histogram of the distribution of observed errors in the reading of a given stored memory value .",
    "the observed values correspond to the remnant resistance of the memory cell , after reading it 80 times at a 10 hz rate , following the set .",
    "the histogram is constructed from a sequence of 460 memory state recordings .",
    "the finite dispersion of the histogram is the main limitation for implementing a high number of memory levels . to easily visualize the retentivity performance of the memory for increasing number of levels , we indicate with horizontal bars the resistance interval @xmath85 ( = @xmath86 ) that corresponds to having a 16 , 32 and 64 mlc memory ( ie , 4 , 5 and 6 bits , respectively ) .",
    "the probability of error in storing a memory state corresponds to the area of the histogram that lays outside the resistance interval normalized to the total area . with a confidence level of 95% , the probability that the mlc fails to retain a stored state is 0.21@xmath870.05 for a 64-level system ( 6 bit mlc ) .",
    "this error probability rapidly improves as the number of levels is decreased , being @xmath88 0.012 for a 16-level mlc .",
    "the previous data on the performance of the memory can also be expressed in terms of the bit error rates ( ber ) . in our mlc , we find ber@xmath890.006 for the 16-level system , ber@xmath890.07 for the 32-level system and ber@xmath890.1 for the 64-level system .",
    "lower error probabilities for bits than for levels , reflects the fact that , typically , the error corresponds to the memory level drifting to an immediate neighbor level ( that often shares a large number of bits ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a feedback algorithm to precisely set the remnant resistance of a rs - device to an arbitrary desired value within the device working range .",
    "this overcomes the conceptual problem of fine tuning a resistance value in non - volatile rs - devices for mlc applications , due the presence of a threshold current behavior .",
    "the feedback configuration is intrinsically time - discrete , since it is based on read / write sequences",
    ". the overhead in the writing time introduced in this feedback system may be a limitation for its utilization as primary memory in a computer system , but it can easily compete with actual speed of the current mass storage devices ( flash memories ) .",
    "the applicability of the concept to implement an n - bit mlc memory was successfully demonstrated for @xmath0 = 4 , 5 and 6 , with an lpcmo - based circuit ; which clearly illustrates the critical trade - off between ber , number of memory levels and ( power and area ) overhead of the control circuitry .",
    "[ fig : simplified - circuit ] shows a simplified circuit of our implementation .",
    "the estimator circuit ( see fig . [ f4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] ) is implemented by ic100d , ic101a and the high - current buffer a3 ( and associated components ) .",
    "it compares the output of the sample and hold ( s&h ) against the input signal divided by 2 , and then computes the pi function . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are set by means of p101 and p100 respectively .    during the correct state , corrective pulses",
    "are applied to the rs - devices ( lpcmo ) , by closing s1 during @xmath92s .",
    "c102 and r109 introduce a time constant of @xmath93s , reducing the rise time of the pulses in order to avoid overshoots . in the probe state , ic103b closes first and @xmath91ms after , ic103a .",
    "also , s4 clamps the inverting input of a3 to @xmath94v+ .",
    "the timing of the circuit is generated by a timing circuit based on the master clock clk ( see fig .",

    "the voltage drop at the switching interface of the rs - device ( ranging 20 - 50 mv ) is amplified by the instrumentation amplifier a1 ( gain=21 ) , eventually setting the voltage at the output of the s&h .",
