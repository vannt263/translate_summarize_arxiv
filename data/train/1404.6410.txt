    "energy - momentum localization plays an important role among the open issues appeared over the years in general relativity .",
    "the difficulty which arises consists in constructing a properly defined energy density of gravitating systems . as a result ,",
    "up today there is no generally accepted satisfactory description for gravitational energy .",
    "a number of researchers have used different methods for the energy - momentum localization .",
    "standard research methods include the use of different tools such as superenergy tensors @xcite , quasi - local expressions @xcite and the well - known energy - momentum complexes of einstein @xcite , landau - lifshitz @xcite , papapetrou @xcite , bergmann - thomson @xcite , mller @xcite , weinberg @xcite , and qadir - sharif @xcite .",
    "the coordinate system dependence of these computational tools remains the main problem encountered .",
    "an alternative to avoid the dependence on coordinates is the tele - parallel theory of gravitation @xcite which has been used in many studies on the calculation of the energy and momentum distribution .",
    "concerning the pseudotensorial prescriptions , only the mller energy - momentum complex is coordinate independent .",
    "schwarzschild cartesian coordinates and kerr - schild cartesian coordinates are used to compute the energy - momentum in the case of the other pseudotensorial prescriptions . in the last decades , despite the critique on energy - momentum complexes , their application has yielded physically reasonable results in the case of many spacetime geometries , in particular for geometries in @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that there is an agreement between on one hand the einstein , landau - lifshitz , papapetrou , bergmann - thomson , weinberg and mller prescriptions and , on the other hand , the quasi - local mass definition introduced by penrose @xcite and developed by tod @xcite for some gravitational backgrounds .",
    "it should be stressed that several pseudotensorial definitions yield the same results for any metric of the kerr - schild class as well as for solutions more general than the kerr - schild class ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , one can underline the similarity of some of the aforementioned results with those obtained by using the tele - parallel theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "finally , one can also point out the ongoing elaboration of the definition and application of energy - momentum complexes , as well as the attempt for their rehabilitation @xcite .",
    "the present work has the following structure : in section 2 we describe the new four - dimensional charged regular black hole solution @xcite under study .",
    "section 3 contains the presentation of the einstein , landau - lifshitz , weinberg and mller energy - momentum complexes utilized for the calculations .",
    "section 4 contains the computations of the energy and momentum distributions .",
    "finally , in the discussion given in section 5 , we present our results and examine some limiting and particular cases . throughout the paper we use geometrized units",

    "the calculations for the einstein , landau - lifshitz and weinberg energy - momentum complexes are performed in schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "greek indices range from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , while latin indices run from @xmath18 to @xmath17 .",
    "attempts to avoid the central singularity in the presence of a horizon for a classical black hole solution have started already in the 1960 s with bardeen s regular black hole solution @xcite followed up by a number of works in the subject ( see , @xcite for a review of existing models and many relevant references ) .",
    "the interest in this research area was revived after e. ayn - beato and a. garca @xcite studied a regular black hole solution coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics , whereby the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is augmented by the addition to the lagrangian of a term depending nonlinearly on the electromagnetic field tensor . since then , a number of very interesting works has been published on this subject @xcite . in fact , it is worth noticing that the aforesaid authors were the first to establish a connection of bardeen s regular black hole solution with a nonlinear electrodynamics leading to the current interpretation o !",
    "f an exact solution supported by a nonlinear magnetic monopole @xcite .",
    "recently , l. balart and e.c .",
    "vagenas @xcite constructed a family of new spherical , static and charged black hole solutions in the context of einstein - nonlinear electrodynamics by imposing the following conditions : ( i ) the weak energy condition has to be satisfied , ( ii ) the energy - momentum tensor has to respect the symmetry @xmath19 and , ( iii ) the metric must have an asymptotical behaviour as the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution .    starting with a general static and spherically symmetric line element : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and by relaxing the third condition , the authors have also constructed a more general family of charged regular black hole solutions which do not behave asymptotically as the reissner - nordstrm black hole metric . in this case , the mass function depends on two integer constant parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath3 is the electric charge , @xmath25 is the gamma function , @xmath2 is the black hole mass and @xmath26 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "particular cases such as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath10 lead to the metrics obtained by bardeen @xcite and hayward @xcite .",
    "the line element ( [ line_element ] ) with the mass function ( [ mass_function ] ) does not behave asymptotically as the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution unless @xmath0 .",

    "the numerical values @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we get figure 1 showing the two horizons .",
    "one can see that the position of the inner horizon is shifted towards bigger values of @xmath5 as the parameter @xmath4 decreases , while the position of the outer horizon remains unaffected .",

    "the local conservation law is respected : @xmath41 thus , the energy and momentum can be calculated by @xmath42 applying gauss theorem , the energy - momentum becomes @xmath43 with @xmath44 the outward unit normal vector over the surface @xmath45 .    in the landau - lifshitz prescription ,",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum complex @xcite is defined as @xmath46 with the landau - lifshitz superpotentials : @xmath47 the @xmath48 and @xmath49 components are the energy and the momentum density , respectively .",
    "the local conservation law holds : @xmath50 by integrating @xmath51 over the 3-space one gets for the energy - momentum : @xmath52 by using gauss theorem we get @xmath53    the weinberg energy - momentum complex @xcite is given as @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the corresponding superpotentials : @xmath56 with @xmath57 here the @xmath58 and @xmath59 components represent the energy and the momentum density , respectively . in the weinberg prescription the local conservation law",
    "is also respected : @xmath60 the integration of @xmath61 over the 3-space gives the energy - momentum : @xmath62 applying gauss theorem and integrating over the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath5 , we get the following expression for the energy - momentum distribution : @xmath63    the mller energy - momentum complex @xcite is @xmath64 with the mller superpotentials @xmath65 @xmath66 being antisymmetric : @xmath67 mller s energy - momentum complex also satisfies the local conservation law @xmath68 while @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the energy and the momentum density respectively .",
    "thus , the energy - momentum is given by @xmath71 with the use of gauss theorem one gets @xmath72",
    "in order to perform the calculations using the einstein energy - momentum complex , it is necessary to transform the metric given by the line element ( [ line_element ] ) in schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus , we obtain the line element in the form : @xmath73 now , after computing the superpotentials in the einstein prescription we get the following non - vanishing components : @xmath74^{(\\alpha -3)/3}}\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath75^{(\\alpha -3)/3}}\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath76^{(\\alpha -3)/3}}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] using the line element ( [ line_element ] ) , with the metric coefficient ( [ metric_coef_b ] ) , the equation ( [ einstein_p ] ) for the energy and the expressions ( [ h001])-([h003 ] ) for the superpotentials , we obtain the energy distribution for the regular charged black hole in the einstein prescription : @xmath77^{(\\alpha -3)/3}}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] further , all the momenta are zero",
    ".    in figures 2 , 3 we can see the graph of the energy distribution as a function of the distance for different values of @xmath4 , while figure 4 presents the energy distribution as a function of charge and mass .                in order to apply the landau - lifshitz prescription",
    ", we use the @xmath78 quantities defined in eq.([ll_p ] ) to compute the energy  momentum distribution .",

    ", the energy in the weinberg prescription ( [ w_energy ] ) is identical with the energy in the landau - lifshitz prescription ( [ ll_energy ] ) .    in figures 5 ,",
    "6 we can see the graph of the energy distribution as a function of the distance for different values of @xmath4 , while figure 7 presents the energy distribution as a function of charge and mass .                in the mller prescription , the only non - vanishing superpotential is : @xmath88 } { r^{2}}-\\frac{48m^{4}(\\frac{\\alpha } { 3}-1)r}{\\left[1+\\frac{8m^{3}r^{3}}{q^{6}}\\right]^{(\\frac{\\alpha } { 3}-1)}q^{6}\\left[1+\\frac{8m^{3}r^{3}}{q^{6}}\\right]}\\right\\}r^{2}\\sin \\theta.\\ ] ]    applying the last result for the line element ( [ line_element ] ) with the metric coefficient ( [ metric_coef_b ] ) and using the expression ( [ m_p ] ) , we get the energy distribution in the mller prescription : @xmath89}{r^{2}}- \\frac{48m^{4}(\\frac{\\alpha } { 3}-1)r}{\\left[1+\\frac{8m^{3}r^{3}}{q^{6}}\\right]^{(\\frac{\\alpha } { 3}-1)}q^{6}\\left[1+\\frac{8m^{3}r^{3}}{q^{6}}\\right]}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] also , in this prescription it is found that all the momenta vanish .    in figures 8 , 9 we can see the graph of the energy distribution as a function of the distance for different values of @xmath4 , while figure 10 presents the energy distribution as a function of charge and mass .                it is pointed out , according to figure 8 , that for @xmath90 the mller energy of the regular black hole is negative and decreases monotonically for the whole range of the values of @xmath5 considered .    finally , in figure 11 we give a comparison of the energy distributions as obtained by the different prescriptions for @xmath91 .",
    "this paper is focused on the study of the energy - momentum for the gravitational field of a new four - dimensional , spherically symmetric , static and charged regular black hole solution developed in the context of einstein - nonlinear electrodynamics coupling , by applying the einstein , landau - lifshitz , weinberg and mller energy - momentum complexes .",
    "the metric considered , which has two horizons , does not asymptotically behave as the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution unless @xmath0 , where @xmath92 is a positive integer parameter .",
    "the expressions for the energy are well - defined in all the aforesaid prescriptions and depend on the mass @xmath2 of the black hole , its charge @xmath3 , a positive integer @xmath93 and the radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "both the landau - lifshitz and weinberg prescriptions give the same result for the energy distribution , while all the momenta are zero in all four prescriptions used .    in order to examine the physical meaning of the results obtained , we study the limiting behavior of the energy for @xmath94 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in three cases : ( i ) @xmath95 , ( ii ) @xmath10 and ( iii ) @xmath96 . however , since the cases ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) do not yield any physically meaningful result , we present only the results for the case ( iii ) in table 1 .       as we can see , the limiting behavior of the energy for the asymptotically reissner - nordstrm solution ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) is the same as in the case of the non - asymptotically reissner - nordstrm solution given in table 1 .",
    "thus , by comparing the results obtained for the energy with all the energy - momentum complexes applied , we see that , for @xmath8 and at infinity , the einstein prescription and the mller prescription give the same results ( namely , the adm mass @xmath2 ) with that obtained for the schwarzschild black hole solution . on the other hand , the landau - lifshitz and the weinberg prescriptions , while at infinity lead to the same result ( the adm mass @xmath2 ) ,",
    "in the chargeless case @xmath8 give the energy distribution @xmath100 which is in total agreement with the expression obtained for the schwarzschild black hole using schwarzschild cartesian coordinates ( see , k.s .",
    "virbhadra ( 1999 ) , in @xcite ) .      based on the present study , as well as on the aforementioned agreement with previous results obtained in the case of the schwarzschild metric",
    ", we conclude that the einstein and mller energy - momentum complexes give physically meaningful results and , thus , can be considered as the most reliable tools among the energy - momentum complexes for the study of the energy - momentum localization of gravitational systems .",
    "an interesting future perspective lies in the calculation of the energy - momentum of the new regular black hole solution considered in the present work by applying other energy - momentum complexes and/or the tele - parallel equivalent to general relativity ( tegr ) .",
