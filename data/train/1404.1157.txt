    "<S> by means of first - principles calculations , we found that the early characterized three - dimensional topological bulk dirac semimetal of the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 na@xmath1bi is dynamically unstable at the ground state due to the presence of the large imaginary phonon frequencies around the @xmath3 point . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , our calculations suggest a new ground state phase which crystalizes in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure with a buckled graphite - like na / bi sheets , which is both energetically and dynamically more stable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the calculations also uncovered that the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase at the ground state is also a topological 3d dirac semimetal , being exactly the same as the electronic states of the metastable @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase .    </S>",
    "<S> three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological bulk dirac semimetals ( tdss ) , as a new class of topological electronic state , is highlighting an exciting frontier of the dirac electrons . in the tdss , </S>",
    "<S> the conduction and valence bands touch only at the discrete dirac points and disperse linearly in all directions in the brillouin zone ( bz ) . </S>",
    "<S> this electronic state is different from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions in graphene and the surface state of the 3d topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tdss exhibits many attractive phenomena , on the one hand , in analog of graphene @xcite , such as high electron mobility and conductivity in the 3d form , etc , and on the other hand , with numerous fascinating quantum properties , including the unique surface states in form of fermi arcs , the weyl phases , the high temperature linear quantum magnetoresistance and the topological magnetic phases as well as the anomalous hall effect @xcite . in general , the tdss </S>",
    "<S> are predicted to exist at the critical phase transition point from a normal insulator and a topological one through the spin - orbital coupling effect or by tuning the chemical composition @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , such bulk dirac points are accidental degeneracies . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , very recently the systems of the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2-na@xmath1bi @xcite that one of the current authors participated in discovering @xcite and @xmath6-bio@xmath7 @xcite and cd@xmath1as@xmath7 @xcite have been demonstrated theoretically and then confirmed experimentally to be tdss in their native phases as their 3d bulk dirac fermions are indeed protected only by the crystallographic symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been noted that the crystal structure of the topological 3d bulk dirac semimetal of na@xmath1bi crystallizes in the na@xmath1as - type phase @xcite with the space group of @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 and @xmath8=2 which was firstly derived in 1937 by brauer and zintl @xcite from a deby - scherrer pattern , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as a matter of fact , the structure of the prototype compound na@xmath1as was re - investigated to correspond to other two closely correlated structures : the anti - laf@xmath1-type ( space group of @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 , @xmath8=6 , fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ tab1 ]        within the context , it is an urgent task to clarify the ground state phase of na@xmath1bi . </S>",
    "<S> according to the pearson s handbook @xcite , na@xmath1bi was attributed to the earlier characterized metastable @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure and the later studies focusing on na@xmath1bi @xcite all follow this structure . here , by means of first - principles calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we have systematically investigated the phase stabilities and the electronic structures of na@xmath1bi at the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results uncovered that the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure is the energetically favorable ground - state phase with thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the early characterized @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure is dynamically unstable with some large imaginary transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes around the high - symmetry k point at ground state . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , their electronic band structures are similar to each other , featured by two 3d bulk dirac fermions protected by the threefold rotated crystal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our calculated results suggest that the ground state @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase of na@xmath1bi is also a robust tds .    the structural optimization and electronic properties of na@xmath1bi were calculated within the framework of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite by employing the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite . the energy cutoff was set at 350 ev and appropriate monkhorst - pack _ </S>",
    "<S> k_-meshes were chosen . </S>",
    "<S> a very accurate optimization of structural parameters was achieved by minimizing forces ( below 0.0001 ev /  ) and stress tensors ( typically below 0.5 _ _ </S>",
    "<S> k__@xmath21 ) . to check the dynamical stability , we further derived the phonon dispersions using the finite - displacement approach as implemented in the _ phonopy _ code @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase stabilities of three structures ( @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 , @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 and @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 ) considered here for na@xmath1bi can be visualized from the energy - vs - volume curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51-na@xmath1bi is about 4 mev / f.u . </S>",
    "<S> lower in energy than the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure . </S>",
    "<S> this small energy difference suggests that the metastable feature of the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure which can be stable above about 46 k simply estimated according to @xmath22@xmath23=@xmath24@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has been noted that the @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 phase is energetically comparable with the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure . </S>",
    "<S> table [ tab1 ] further compiles the optimized lattice parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as early as 1965 mansmann suspected that na@xmath1bi crystalizes in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure and refined its lattice constants @xcite in good agreement with our currently derived data in table [ tab1 ] , but he did not report the specified atomic sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase has two formula units per unit cell ( @xmath8 = 2 ) , which is about one third in size of the other two competing structures ( @xmath8 = 6 ) . for the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase , </S>",
    "<S> the bi atom lies at 2@xmath5 site ( 1/3,2/3,1/4 ) and the na atoms occupy two inequivalent sites , na1 at 2@xmath26 site ( 0 , 0 , 1/4 ) and na2 at 4__f _ _ site ( 1/3 , 2/3 , 0.58269 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation leads to a layered structure with the staking sequence of na-(graphite - like na / bi sheet)-na and the graphite - like na / bi sheet is separated by the sodium atoms , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the na - bi distances within the graphite - like layers are around 3.151   and the vertical na - bi bonds between the adjacent layers are about 3.228  thus the na and bi atoms forming a base - centred tetrahedron .    in particular , the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure </S>",
    "<S> is closely correlated with the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 one . </S>",
    "<S> the important difference is that in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure the layered graphite - like na / bi sheets are distorted ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c and d ) . at first , the upper / lower shifting ( about 0.05   ) of the partial na1 atoms along the _ c_-axis in the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase can be visualized , forming buckled graphite - like na / bi sheets . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the original na2 atoms in the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase distort within the _ ab_-plane . therefore , there are three inequivalent na wykoff sites in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure ( see table [ tab1 ] and fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the bismuth atom is surrounded by seven na atoms at the na - bi interacting distances ranging from 3.176 to 3.495   in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase , whereas the coordination numbers for bismuth in the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure is ten from the na - bi interacting distances from 3.152 to 3.544   .    meanwhile , the @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 structure share a similar feature of this @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase with buckled graphite - like na / bi sheets . </S>",
    "<S> but , their differences are also highly obvious . in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure , </S>",
    "<S> the na1 and bi atoms lie in the same layer and the na2 atoms are out of the the plane comprised by na1 and bi . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 structure , the na1 atom does not lie in the same layer as bi stays ( fig . [ fig1]g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be clearly visualized from their projections along both [ 0001 ] and [ 11@xmath270 ] directions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e and h ) . </S>",
    "<S> it needs to be emphasized that k@xmath1bi was experimentally suggested to crystallize in this @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 structure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a complete description of that structure can be referred to olofsson s detailed discussion@xcite .    6@xmath1/@xmath2 , @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 and @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     radiation with @xmath28 = 1.54439  for the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 ( green ) and @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 ( red ) </S>",

    "<S> the red circles indicate the projection to the na-3__s _ </S>",
    "<S> _ states.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c and i ) , both @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 and @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 phases of na@xmath1bi exhibit the imaginary phonon frequencies around the @xmath3 and @xmath29 point , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this fact demonstrates their structural instabilities at the ground state . from the analysis of the eigenvectors from the phonon calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we found two soft transverse acoustic ( ta ) mode on na atoms being orthogonal to the bismuth plane . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals that the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase can be converted into a dynamically stable structure by tuning the na atoms along the direction of soft modes . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , these atomic vibrational directions are exactly the same orientations that the na atoms distort to in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase , as discussed above . as a further supporting evidence </S>",
    "<S> , there is no imaginary phonon frequencies in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath5 structure ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](f ) ) , which indicates the dynamical stability of the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure at the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> because the valence number of the na atom is much less than that of bi and the bi networks remain unchanged in the three structures , it is highly difficult to distinct them from the powder xrd patterns . </S>",
    "<S> as analyzed in details for laf@xmath1 and na@xmath1n @xcite , their xrd patterns of both the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 and @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 structures are so close that it is impossible to distinguish these structures . </S>",
    "<S> lucky , through our calculations for na@xmath1bi , the candidate of the @xmath06@xmath1@xmath9 structure can be safely excluded due to its instability of phonon dispersion at the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we note that the simulated xrd patterns ( cu k@xmath30 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) for both the metastable @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure and the ground state @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 one show minor differences . as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , there are two additional small peaks at ( 022 ) and ( @xmath3131 ) which can be clearly seen in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 phase . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we believe that the careful xrd experimental measurements can effectively distinguish these two phases .    figure [ fig4 ] further compiles the calculated electronic structure of the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted that its electronic structures are almost the same as what the metastable @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 structure exhibits @xcite . from the density of states in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) , the na-3__s _ _ and bi-6__p _ _ states dominates the valence and conduction bands , respectively . as evidenced in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , the top valence bands are mostly occupied by the bi-6@xmath32 states , whereas the conduction bands comprised mostly by the na3 - 3@xmath33 states with highly strong dispersion . in similarity with the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase @xcite , the most crucial feature of the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure also shows an inverted band structure . in the case without the inclusion of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect , </S>",
    "<S> the na-3@xmath33 state lies in the valence bands , being energetically lower than the bi-6p@xmath34 states by about 0.26 ev at the @xmath29 point . by switching on the soc effect , </S>",
    "<S> the na-3@xmath33 state becomes even lower in energy by 0.75 ev than the bi-6@xmath35@xmath34 states . </S>",
    "<S> although the inverted band structure appears , the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure is not a nontrivial topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , it is a topological semimetal with two 3d bulk dirac points at ( 0 , 0 , @xmath36 @xmath370.256@xmath38 ) along the @xmath29-a direction as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) , being exactly the same with that of the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , in similarity to the @xmath06@xmath1/@xmath2 phase @xcite the 3d dirac cones are indeed protected by the threefold rotation crystal symmetry in the @xmath0@xmath4@xmath51 structure . </S>",
    "<S> although in this case , the graphite - like na / bi sheets are buckled due to the shifting of na2 atoms , its threefold rotation symmetry still remains unchanged . within this condition </S>",
    "<S> , the 3d bulk dirac cones would be highly robust . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it needs to be mentioned that each 3d bulk dirac cone is fourfold degenerated , linearly dispersing around the fermi point . </S>",
