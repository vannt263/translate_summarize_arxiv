    "the only known proof of this theorem was published by monsky in 1970 @xcite . the proof is based on two key ideas : the sperner s lemma and the coloring of the plane in three colors based on a 2adic valuation .",

    "the first generalization was conjectured by stein and proved by monsky in 1990 @xcite .",
    "it claims that a centrally symmetric polygon can not be cut into an odd number of triangles of equal areas .",
    "though it is based on the same idea of 3-coloring , this proof is technically more challenging than the proof in the case of the square and uses a non - trivial homological technique .    in 1994",

    "@xmath0 is called _ balanced _ if its edges can be divided into pairs so that in each pair edges are parallel , equal in length and have opposite orientation ( the edges are oriented , their orientation comes from the orientation of the boundary ) .",

    "this function is not unique and its construction is based on the axiom of choice .",

    "any area - preserving affine transformation @xmath92 acts on the four vertices of @xmath90 by permutation , a simple check shows that @xmath93 .",
    "we will apply lemma [ two ] to the three colorings corresponding to the following area  preserving affine transformations :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    by lemma [ two ] , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100",
    "so , @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , applying the same procedure to affine transformations @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we get @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "for two vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 their _ wedge product _ is defined as the oriented area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors .",
    "it can be calculated as the determinant : @xmath108    for any closed broken line @xmath109 we define its generalised area by @xmath110    for a non  selfintersecting broken line the notion defined above gives the oriented area of a polygon , which is bounded by the broken line .",
    "[ three+ ] for a lattice parallelogram @xmath111 the following is true :    * if area of @xmath111 is even , then @xmath112 * if area of @xmath111 is odd , then @xmath113    the parallelogram can be cut into two equal triangles of the integer area .",
    "the application of lemma [ two ] gives the first statement .    to prove the second statement",
    ", we will show that if the parallelogram @xmath111 has odd area , then all its pairs of coordinates of vertices are different modulo @xmath1 . if the vertices of the parallelogram have coordinates @xmath114 , @xmath115 , then its area is equal to @xmath116 @xmath117 from this formula , it is clear that if there are two vertices with both @xmath118 and @xmath119 coordinates being conjugate modulo @xmath1 , then @xmath120 is even .",
    "so , vertices of the parallelogram are colored in colors a , b , c , c. depending on the order in which these colors follow each other we obtain one of the cycles @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123",
    ".    the following lemma generalizes lemma [ three+ ]    [ four ] if @xmath0 is a balanced lattice polygon , then the image of its boundary under the map @xmath71 is representing a class @xmath124 in the group @xmath125 , which is lying in a subgroup of index @xmath1 generated by @xmath126 : @xmath127 for some @xmath128 .",
    "+ furthermore , @xmath129    parallelograms are basic examples of balanced polygons and we have seen that lemma [ four ] holds true for them .",
    "now , we are going to show that any balanced polygon is built from parallelograms in some sense .",
    "for this we need to describe an action of group @xmath130 on the set of broken lines .    for a broken line @xmath109 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath131 the side vector of @xmath52 ( here @xmath132 ) .",
    "any @xmath133 acts on the set of broken lines according to the rule : @xmath134 with @xmath135 , and for each @xmath136 @xmath137 this action sends balanced broken lines to balanced and lattice to lattice .    let @xmath138 denote a transposition @xmath139 . it is well known that a set @xmath140 generates @xmath130 . one can check that @xmath141 and @xmath142 here p is a parallelogram @xmath143 , with @xmath144 these properties guarantee that broken lines @xmath52 and @xmath145 satisfy the conditions of lemma [ four ] simultaneously .",
    "since lattice polygon @xmath0 is balanced , number @xmath44 of its vertices is even and sides of @xmath0 can be indexed by numbers @xmath146 and @xmath147 so that @xmath148 and sides with indices @xmath149 and @xmath150 are parallel , equal in length and inherit opposite orientations from the polygons boundary .",
    "numbers @xmath149 and @xmath150 are just natural numbers from @xmath151 to @xmath148 , so one can consider permutation @xmath152    in the broken line @xmath153 after any side with an odd number goes the side parallel and equal to it and having the opposite direction . both the area and",
    "the class of @xmath153 in @xmath154 is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath155 can be presented as a product of transpositions @xmath138 , @xmath156 satisfies the conditions of lemma [ four ] .",
    "now we are ready to finish the proof of our main result .",
    "suppose that for a balanced lattice polygon @xmath0 of integer odd area there exist a cut into an odd number of triangles of equal areas . if @xmath157 and the number of triangles is equal to @xmath158 , then the area of each of them is @xmath159 .",

    "this contradicts the oddness of @xmath160 .",
    "in the following section no new results are obtained , so the style will be rather informal .    it is more natural to define tropical colorings on @xmath166  the real projective plane .",
    "it is well - known that a point of @xmath166 is defined by its homogenious coordinates  a triple of real numbers @xmath167 $ ] with not all @xmath168 equal to @xmath3 . for any nonzero @xmath169 triples",
    "@xmath167 $ ] and @xmath170 $ ] define the same point .",
    "one can define a * momentum map * from the projective plane to a triangle @xmath171 in the plane with vertices ( 1,0),(0,1 ) and ( 0,0 ) : @xmath172 defined by the formula @xmath173)=\\frac{2^{-\\nu_2(x ) } \\big ( 1,0\\big )   + 2^{-\\nu_2(y ) } \\big ( 0,1\\big)+ 2^{-\\nu_2(z ) } \\big ( 0,0\\big)}{2^{-\\nu_2(x)}+2^{-\\nu_2(y)}+2^{-\\nu_2(z)}}.\\ ] ]        one can check that the image of any line in @xmath166 under the momentum map is a union of three segments sharing a common end . for each segment",
    "the remaining end is lying on a side of triangle @xmath171 and the whole segment is contained within a line , passing through the vertex of @xmath171 opposite to the side .    the image of the line @xmath174 cuts t into three pieces , whose points we color in three colors a , b and c.",
    "now we can color each point in @xmath166 in the color of its image under the momentum map .",
    "this coloring is the same as coloring @xmath89 constructed in the beginning of the paper if considered on the affine chart of @xmath166 with @xmath175 .",
    "[ a. hales , e. straus , 1982 ] [ hs ] let @xmath21 be a set of algebraic curves in @xmath66 having the same newton polygon @xmath111 with @xmath44 integer points inside ( @xmath21 is a @xmath44dimensional linear system of algebraic curves ) .",
    "then there exists a coloring of @xmath66 in @xmath176 colors such that no curve in @xmath21 contains all @xmath176 colors and no color is confined within a curve in @xmath21.dimensional linear systems of algebraic curves without based points . ]          in @xcite such colorings are constructed algebraically ; here we will give a tropical explanation of this construction .",
    "by @xmath177 we mean @xmath178 .",
    "let us consider algebraic torus @xmath179 and `` a momentum map '' : @xmath180 where @xmath181    there exists a curve with newton polygon @xmath111 , whose image devides @xmath182 into @xmath183 regions .",
    "we assign to them different colors .",
    "it can be proved that the image of any other curve with newton polygon @xmath111 intersects at most @xmath44 regions .",
    "now , we can color each point in @xmath184 in the color of the region of @xmath66 containing its image .",
    "this coloring is the same as that constructed by hales and straus .",
    "this illustration shows that colorings constructed in @xcite are natural from the perspective , suggested by tropical geometry .",
    "unfortunatelly , it does not lead to an easier way of proving theorem [ hs ] , because of both combinatorial difficulties in analyzing the way in which two tropical curves intersect and algebraic difficulties in extending the colorings from @xmath185 to the whole @xmath186 ."
