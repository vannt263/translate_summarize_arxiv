    "the @xmath6laplacian of a function @xmath7 on @xmath3 is defined by @xmath8 for suitable @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0-laplacian can be used to model the flow of a fluid through porous media in turbulent regime ( see for instance @xcite ) or the glacier s ice when treated as a non - newtonian fluid with a nonlinear relationship between the rate deformation tensor and the deviatoric stress tensor ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also used in the hele - shaw approximation , a moving boundary problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us present a model , well known in the case of the laplace operator , which remains very useful to understand the physical meaning behind some inequalities that we shall prove , in particular those involving the inner radius of @xmath3 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the @xmath0-laplacian is often used to reflect the impact of non ideal material to the usual vibrating homogeneous elastic membrane , modeled by the laplace operator .",
    "thus , the following is used to describe a nonlinear elastic membrane under the load @xmath7 , @xmath9 the solution @xmath10 stands for the deformation of the membrane from the rest position ( see @xcite ) . in that case ,",
    "its deformation energy is given by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , a minimizer of the rayleigh quotient , @xmath12 on @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 here @xmath15 is usually referred as the principal frequency of the vibrating non elastic membrane .      for @xmath5 , we study the following eigenvalue problem :    @xmath16    where we impose the dirichlet boundary condition and consider @xmath17 to be the real spectral parameter .",
    "we say that @xmath17 is an eigenvalue of @xmath18 if has a nontrivial weak solution @xmath19 .",
    "that is , for any @xmath20 , @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is then called an eigenfunction of @xmath18 associated to the eigenvalue @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , it is well known that one can obtain an increasing sequence of eigenvalues tending to @xmath25 via the rayleigh - ritz method . moreover , those are all the eigenvalues of @xmath26 .",
    "linearity is a crucial component in the argument .    for the general case",
    ", it is known that the first eigenvalue of the dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the @xmath0-laplace operator , denoted by @xmath15 , is characterized as , @xmath27 the infinimum is attained for a function @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 is simple and isolated ( there is no sequence of eigenvalues such that @xmath29 tends to @xmath15 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the eigenfunction @xmath30 associated to @xmath15 does not change sign , and it is the only such eigenfunction ( a proof can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "as for @xmath31 , it allows a min - max characterization and every eigenfunction associated to @xmath32 changes sign only once in @xmath3 ( it was first shown in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is not known if @xmath32 is isolated . via for instance",
    "lyusternick - schnirelmann maximum principle , it is possible to construct @xmath29 for @xmath33 and hence obtain an increasing sequence of eigenvalues of .",
    "there exist other variational characterizations of the @xmath34 eigenvalues .",
    "however , no matter what variational characterization one chooses , it always remains to show that all the eigenvalues obtained exhaust the whole spectrum of @xmath34 .",
    "using the domain monotonicity property , it is easy to obtain an upper bound for the principal frequency of the @xmath0-laplacian . indeed , for @xmath35 , we have that @xmath36 therefore , if we consider the largest ball that can be inscribed in @xmath3 , we get @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "note that unlike the case @xmath24 corresponding to the laplace operator , there are no explicit formulas for @xmath15 of a ball .",
    "lower bounds involving the principal frequency are a greater challenge .",
    "nevertheless , some results are known .",
    "let us start by recalling that the classical faber - krahn inequality can be adapted to the @xmath0-laplacian as noted in @xcite and @xcite ( see also the rearrangement results in @xcite ) : among all domains of given @xmath1-dimensional volume , the ball minimizes @xmath15 . in other words",
    ", we have that @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the @xmath1-dimensional ball of same volume than @xmath3 . for the laplacian , lower bounds of the type @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive constant , have been studied extensively . if @xmath43 , the first result proved in that direction is due to j. hersch in @xcite , and states that for convex simply connected planar domains , the latter inequality holds with the constant @xmath44 .",
    "this result was later improved by e. makai in @xcite .",
    "for all simply connected domains , he obtained the constant @xmath45 .",
    "an adaptation of makai s method for the pseudo @xmath0-laplacian was studied in @xcite and lead to a similar lower bound for simply - connected convex planar domains .    by a different approach",
    ", w. k. hayman also obtained a bound for simply - connected domains with the constant , @xmath46 .",
    "r. osserman ( see @xcite ) later improved that result to @xmath47 .",
    "r. osserman also relaxed the assumption of simple connectedness of the domain by considering the connectivity @xmath48 of a planar domain has a parameter .",
    "he obtained a similar lower bound for domains of connectivity @xmath49 , a result that was improved in @xcite .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "it was first noted by w. k. hayman in @xcite that if @xmath50 is a ball with many narrow inward pointing spikes removed from it , then @xmath51 but in that case the inradius of @xmath50 tends to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , bounds of the type , @xmath53 are generally not possible to obtain even if @xmath3 is assumed to be simply connected .",
    "the higher dimensional case for euclidean domains is discussed in section [ s3 ] .",
    "similar bounds on manifolds are presented in section [ s4 ] .    in the next subsection",
    ", we extend some of these results to the case @xmath54 .",
    "the size nodal set of an eigenfunction of the @xmath0-laplacian is also discussed . all proofs are given in section [ s5 ] .",
    "we present some lower bounds for the principal frequency involving the inradius of a planar domain with an explicit constant , @xmath55 we do so by adapting proofs obtained for the usual laplacian .",
    "we need two main ingredients : a modified cheeger - type inequality ( see the original result for the laplacian in @xcite ; a generalized version for the @xmath0-laplacian can be found in @xcite ) , and a geometric inequality relating the ratio of the length of the boundary of a domain and its area .",
    "regarding the modified cheeger inequality , it consists of an adapted version of a result in @xcite :    [ cheegerlemma ] let @xmath56 be a riemannian surface , and let @xmath57 be a domain homeomorphic to a planar domain of finite connectivity @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the family of relatively compact subdomains of @xmath59 with smooth boundary and with connectivity at most @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the area of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the length of its boundary .",
    "then , @xmath64    the crucial point of lemma [ cheegerlemma ] resides in the fact that the cheeger constant is computed among subdomains that have a connectivity of at most the connectivity of the domain , which allows us to use geometric inequalities accordingly .",
    "we start by proving the following extension of osserman - croke s result to the @xmath0-laplacian .",
    "we actually generalize a stronger result that was implicit in @xcite and @xcite , but made explicit in @xcite . instead of considering the inner radius , we use the reduced inradius , which is defined by : @xmath65 notice that @xmath66 .",
    "the first main result consists of extending classical planar inradius bounds of the laplace operator to the case of the @xmath0-laplacian :    [ osscrop1 ] let @xmath3 be a domain in @xmath67 . if @xmath3 is simply connected , then for all @xmath68 , we have that @xmath69 if @xmath3 is of connectivity @xmath49 , then for all @xmath68 , we have that @xmath70    it is hard to say whether these bounds are optimal for the case @xmath54 since we can not compute eigenfunctions and eigenvalues explicitly on simple domains , unlike the case of the usual laplacian . also note that for the laplace operator , instead of the constant @xmath71 given by , the better constant @xmath72 was found using probabilistic methods in @xcite .    for a bounded domain @xmath3 in @xmath73 , the ground state problem associated to the @xmath74-laplacian is the following : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "it is a notable feature that @xmath77 , i.e. the value of @xmath78 can immediately be read off the geometry of @xmath3 , without any topological assumptions on @xmath3 ( see @xcite and reference therein for additional details ) .      as @xmath79 ,",
    "the limit equation formally reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 where @xmath82 with @xmath59 varying over all non - empty sets @xmath83 of finite perimeter ( see @xcite for instance ) . here",
    ", @xmath3 is assumed to be smooth enough .",
    "if we restrict the subdomains considered in the computation of @xmath84 to smooth simply connected ones , we get    [ p=1 ] if @xmath3 is a simply connected planar domain , then @xmath85      this subsection is devoted to the study of the size of the nodal set @xmath86 of an eigenfunction @xmath22 of .",
    "yau s conjecture ( see @xcite ) asserts that the size of the nodal set of an eigenfunction @xmath22 is comparable to @xmath87 .",
    "donnelly and fefferman ( see @xcite ) proved yau s conjecture for real analytic manifolds .",
    "however , if one assumes only that @xmath88 is smooth , yau s conjecture remains partially open . in the planar case",
    ", it is known that @xmath89 where @xmath90 stands for the @xmath91-dimensional hausdorff measure ( see @xcite ) . if @xmath92 , lower bounds were obtained ( see recent works of sogge - zelditch in @xcite , colding - minicozzi in @xcite , and mangoubi in @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize the lower bound in the planar case for the @xmath0-laplacian on a planar bounded domain .",
    "however , the situation is slightly different from the one for the laplace operator mainly since it is still not known whether the interior of @xmath93 is empty or not ( see for instance @xcite for a discussion on that matter ) .",
    "the result is the following :    [ nodalsets ] let @xmath3 be a planar bounded domain .",
    "there is a constant @xmath94 such that for @xmath95 , there exists a positive constant @xmath96 such that @xmath97    in order to prove the previous theorem , we need to start proving the analog of a classical result of the dirichlet laplacian stating that every eigenfunction must vanish in a ball of radius comparable to the wavelength :    [ zeros ] let @xmath98 be a bounded domain .",
    "let @xmath99 where @xmath100 the first eigenvalue of a ball of radius @xmath91 . then ,",
    "any eigenfunction @xmath22 of vanishes in any ball of radius @xmath101 .",
    "this result can be deduced from .",
    "recall that if @xmath102 , w. k. hayman s counterexample holds . therefore , it is not possible to get such lower bounds in that case even if @xmath3 is simply connected or if @xmath103 connected .",
    "nevertheless , e. lieb obtained a similar lower bound by relaxing the condition that the ball has to be completely inscribed in @xmath3 . by doing so",
    ", one can also relax some hypotheses on @xmath3 .",
    "instead , throughout this section , we shall only assume that @xmath3 is an open subset of @xmath4 .",
    "no assumptions on the boundedness or on the smoothness of the boundary of @xmath3 are required .",
    "we denote the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath18 by @xmath104 . in the case",
    "that @xmath3 is a bounded domain , @xmath104 corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath18 with dirichlet boundary condition as defined in . in the general case , we write @xmath105 lieb s method to get such a bound is to allow a fixed fraction @xmath106 of the lebesgue measure of the ball to stick out of @xmath3 .",
    "the result can be found in @xcite .",
    "it states that for a fixed @xmath106 , if @xmath107 where @xmath108 , then @xmath109 here @xmath110 .",
    "notice that the constant in the lower bound is not totally explicit since it depends on @xmath111 , which is not known explicitly for @xmath54 .",
    "mazya and shubin obtained a similar bound , but instead of using lebesgue measure , they considered the wiener capacity .",
    "the goal of this section is to generalize results of @xcite to the @xmath0-laplacian to cover the case where @xmath112 .",
    "to do so , we mainly use results stated in @xcite and simplify the approach used in @xcite , while losing the explicit constants in the bounds . recall that @xmath0-capacity is defined for a compact set @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , as @xmath115 fix @xmath116 .",
    "a compact set @xmath117 is said to be @xmath118-negligible if @xmath119 we are ready to state the main result of this section and its corollaries :    [ thm1 ] if @xmath120 , there exist two positive constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 that depend only on @xmath123 such that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the interior @xmath0-capacity radius .",
    "a direct application of theorem [ thm1 ] is the following :    [ coro1 ] if @xmath120 , then @xmath126 .",
    "corollary [ coro1 ] gives a necessary and sufficient condition of strict positivity of the operator @xmath18 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "for instance , let @xmath3 be the complement of any cartesian grid in @xmath127 ( this example is adapted from @xcite . clearly , for any @xmath116 , @xmath128 ; thus , @xmath129 . however , if @xmath3 is a narrow strip , @xmath130 , implying that @xmath131 .    note that",
    "since @xmath132 does not depend on @xmath133 , we immediately get the following :    if @xmath120 , the conditions @xmath134 for different @xmath133 s are all equivalent .",
    "also , one can show that for @xmath120 , the lower bound given by theorem [ thm1 ] implies the lower bound obtained earlier by lieb , .",
    "to do so , one needs to use an isocapacity inequality that can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2.3 ) , stating that if @xmath135 be a compact subset of @xmath4 , then @xmath136 where equality occurs if and only if @xmath135 is a ball .",

    "suppose that @xmath142 therefore , using , we get that @xmath143 yielding the desired result .",
    "another way to avoid such difficulty is to consider convex domains in @xmath73 .",
    "doing so , we can prove the following :    if @xmath3 be a convex body in @xmath73 , then the following inequality @xmath144 holds for all @xmath145 :    the proof is based on two key facts ( see @xcite ) , namely that the inequality , @xmath146 is required to be true only for subdomains bounded by level surfaces of the first eigenfunction of @xmath3 ( see the proof of lemma [ cheegerlemma ] ) , and that if @xmath3 is convex , then those subdomains @xmath147 are also convex ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.13 ) ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath148 , the proposition then follows easily .",
    "a striking difference between the usual laplace operator and the @xmath0-laplacian is that it is possible to obtain bounds of the type in higher dimensions , as long as @xmath0 is `` large enough '' compared to the dimension .",
    "indeed , w.k .",
    "hayman s observation remains valid in the case @xmath149 since for such @xmath0 , every curve has a trivial @xmath0-capacity . on the other hand , for @xmath150 ,",
    "even a single point has a positive @xmath0-capacity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 , proposition 5 and its corollary ) ) .",
    "consequently , w. k. hayman s counterexample no longer holds since removing a single point has an impact on the eigenvalues as it can be seen from . taking the latter observation into account ,",
    "it is possible to prove the following theorem :    [ thmprincipal ] let @xmath151 and let @xmath3 be a bounded domain .",
    "then there exists a positive constant @xmath152 such that @xmath153    it is known that if @xmath154 , every curve has a positive @xmath0-capacity .",
