    "increasing use of computers and networks in business , government , recreation , and almost all aspects of daily life has led to a proliferation of online sensitive data about individuals and organizations .",
    "consequently , the study of privacy has become a top priority in many disciplines .",
    "computer scientists have contributed many formulations of the notion of _ privacy - preserving computation _ that have opened new avenues of investigation and shed new light on some well studied problems .",
    "one good example of a new avenue of investigation opened by concern about privacy can be found in auction design , which was our original motivation for this work .",
    "traditional auction theory is a central research area in economics , and one of its main questions is how to incent bidders to behave truthfully , _",
    "i.e. _ , to reveal private information that auctioneers need in order to compute optimal outcomes .",
    "more recently , attention has turned to the complementary goal of enabling bidders _ not _ to reveal private information that auctioneers do _ not _ need in order to compute optimal outcomes .",
    "the importance of bidders privacy , like that of algorithmic efficiency , has become clear now that many auctions are conducted online , and computer science has become at least as relevant as economics .",
    "our approach to privacy is based on communication complexity .",
    "although originally motivated by agents privacy in mechanism design , our definitions and tools can be applied to distributed function computation in general . because perfect privacy can be impossible or infeasibly costly to achieve , we investigate approximate privacy . specifically , we formulate both worst - case and average - case versions of the _ privacy - approximation ratio _ of a function @xmath3 in order to quantify the amount of privacy that can be maintained by parties who supply sensitive inputs to a distributed computation of @xmath3 .",
    "we also study the tradeoff between privacy preservation and communication complexity .",
    "our points of departure are the work of chor and kushilevitz  @xcite on characterization of privately computable functions and that of kushilevitz  @xcite on the communication complexity of private computation .",
    "starting from the same place , bar - yehuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also provided a framework in which to quantify the amount of privacy that can be maintained in the computation of a function and the communication cost of achieving it .",
    "their definitions and results are significantly different from the ones we present here ( see discussion in appendix  [ apx : bar - yehuda ] ) ; as explained in section  [ section - discussion ] below , a precise characterization of the relationship between their formulation and ours is an interesting direction for future work .",
    "consider an auction of a bluetooth headset with @xmath4 bidders , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , in which the auctioneer accepts bids ranging from $ 0 to $ 7 in $ 1 increments .",
    "each bidder @xmath6 has a private value @xmath7 that is the maximum he is willing to pay for the headset",
    ". the item is sold in a @xmath0-price vickrey auction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the _ higher _ bidder gets the item ( with ties broken in favor of bidder @xmath5 ) , and the price he pays is the _ lower _ bid .",
    "the demand for privacy arises naturally in such scenarios  @xcite : in a straightforward protocol , the auctioneer receives sealed bids from both bidders and computes the outcome based on this information .",
    "e.g. _ , that bidder @xmath5 bids $ 3 , and bidder @xmath4 bids $ 6 .",
    "the auctioneer sells the headset to bidder @xmath4 for $ 3 .",
    "it would not be at all surprising however if , in subsequent auctions of headsets in which bidder @xmath4 participates , the same auctioneer set a reservation price of $ 5 .",
    "this could be avoided if the auction protocol allowed the auctioneer to learn the fact that bidder @xmath4 was the highest bidder ( something he needs to know in order to determine the outcome ) but did not entail the full revelation of @xmath4 s private value for the headset .",
    "-price auctions , height=336 ]    observe that , in some cases , revelation of the exact private information of the highest bidder is necessary . for example , if @xmath8 , then bidder @xmath4 will win only if @xmath9 .",
    "in other cases , the revelation of a lot of information is necessary , _ e.g. _ , if bidder @xmath5 s bid is @xmath10 , and bidder @xmath4 outbids him , then @xmath11 must be either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "an auction protocol is said to achieve _ perfect objective privacy _ if the auctioneer learns nothing about the private information of the bidders that is not needed in order to compute the result of the auction .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustrate ] illustrates the information the auctioneer _ must _ learn in order to determine the outcome of the @xmath0-price auction described above .",
    "observe that the auctioneer s failure to distinguish between two potential pairs of inputs that belong to different rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate ] implies his inability to determine the winner or the price the winner must pay . also observe , however , that the auctioneer need not be able to distinguish between two pairs of inputs that belong to the same rectangle .    using the `` minimal knowledge requirements '' described in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate ] , we can now characterize a perfectly ( objective ) privacy - preserving auction protocol as one that induces this _ exact _ partition of the space of possible inputs into subspaces in which the inputs are indistinguishable to the auctioneer .",
    "unfortunately , perfect privacy is often hard or even impossible to achieve . for @xmath0-price auctions , brandt and sandholm  @xcite",
    "show that _ every _ perfectly private auction protocol has exponential communication complexity .",
    "this provides the motivation for our definition of _ privacy - approximation ratio _ : we are interested in whether there is an auction protocol that achieves `` good '' privacy guarantees without paying such a high price in computational efficiency .",
    "we no longer insist that the auction protocol induce a partition of inputs _",
    "exactly _ as in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate ] but rather that it `` approximate '' the optimal partition well .",
    "we define two kinds of privacy - approximation ratio ( par ) : _ worst - case _ par and _ average - case _ par .",
    "the worst - case par of a protocol @xmath14 for the @xmath0-price auction is defined as the maximum ratio between the size of a set @xmath15 of indistinguishable inputs in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate ] and the size of a set of indistinguishable inputs induced by @xmath14 that is contained in @xmath15 .",
    "if a protocol is perfectly privacy preserving , these sets are always the same size , and so the worst - case par is @xmath5 .",
    "if , however , a protocol fails to achieve perfect privacy , then at least one `` ideal '' set of indistinguishable inputs _",
    "strictly _ contains a set of indistinguishable inputs induced by the protocol . in such cases ,",
    "the worst - case par will be strictly higher than @xmath5 .",
    "consider , _",
    "e.g. _ , the sealed - bid auction protocol in which both bidders reveal their private information to the auctioneer , who then computes the outcome .",
    "obviously , this naive protocol enables the auctioneer to distinguish between every two pairs of private inputs , and so each set of indistinguishable inputs induced by the protocol contains exactly one element .",
    "the worst - case par of this protocol is therefore @xmath16 .",
    "( if bidder @xmath4 s value is @xmath17 , then in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate ] the auctioneer is unable to determine which value in @xmath18 is @xmath19 . in the sealed bid auction protocol",
    ", however , the auctioneer learns the exact value of @xmath19 . )",
    "the _ average - case _ par is a natural bayesian variant of this definition : we now assume that the auctioneer has knowledge of some market statistics , in the form of a probability distribution over the possible private information of the bidders .",
    "par in this case is defined as the average ratio and not as the maximum ratio as before .",
    "thus , intuitively , par captures the effect of a protocol on the privacy ( in the sense of indistinguishability from other inputs ) afforded to protocol participants  it indicates the factor by which , in the worst case or on average , using the protocol to compute the function , instead of just being told the output , reduces the number of inputs from which a given input can not be distinguished .",
    "to formalize and generalize the above intuitive definitions of par , we make use of machinery from communication - complexity theory . specifically , we use the concepts of _ monochromaticity _ and _ tilings _ to make formal the notions of sets of indistinguishable inputs and of the approximability of privacy .",
    "we discuss other notions of approximate privacy in section  [ section - discussion ] .",
    "we present both upper and lower bounds on the privacy - approximation ratio for both the millionaires problem and @xmath0-price auctions with @xmath4 bidders .",
    "our analysis of these two environments takes place within yao s @xmath4-party communication model  @xcite , in which the private information of each party is a @xmath2-bit string , representing a value in @xmath1 . in the millionaires problem",
    ", the two parties ( the millionaires ) wish to keep their private information hidden _ from each other_. we refer to this goal as the preservation of _ subjective _ privacy . in electronic - commerce environments , each party ( bidder ) often communicates with the auctioneer via a secure channel , and",
    "so the aim in the @xmath0-price auction is to prevent _ a third party _ (",
    "the auctioneer ) , who is unfamiliar with any of the parties private inputs , from learning `` too much '' about the bidders . this goal is referred to , in this paper , as the preservation of _ objective _ privacy .    informally ,",
    "for both the @xmath0-price vickrey auction and the millionaires problem , we obtain the following results : we show that not only is perfect privacy impossible or infeasibly costly to achieve , but even close approximations of perfect privacy suffer from the same lower bounds .",
    "by contrast , we show that , if the values of the parties are drawn uniformly at random from @xmath1 , then , for both problems , simple and natural communication protocols have privacy - approximation ratios that are linear in @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ , logarithmic in the size of the space of possible inputs ) .",
    "we conjecture that this improved par is achievable for _ any _ probability distribution .",
    "the correctness of this conjecture would imply that , no matter what beliefs the protocol designer may have about the parties private values , a protocol that achieves reasonable privacy guarantees exists .",
    "importantly , our results for the @xmath0-price vickrey auction are obtained by proving a more general result for a large family of protocols for single - item auctions , termed `` _ _ bounded - bisection auctions _ _ '' , that contains both the celebrated ascending - price english auction and the class of bisection auctions  @xcite .",
    "we show that our results for the millionaires problem also extend to the classic economic problem of _ provisioning a public good _ , by observing that , in terms of privacy - approximation ratios , the two problems are , in fact , equivalent .        as explained above , the privacy work of bar - yehuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and the work presented in this paper have common ancestors in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the work of brandt and sandholm  @xcite uses kushilevitz s formulation to prove an exponential lower bound on the communication complexity of privacy - preserving @xmath0-price vickrey auctions .",
    "we elaborate on the relation of our work to that of bar - yehuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in appendix  [ apx : bar - yehuda ] .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , our work focuses on the two - party deterministic communication model .",
    "we view our results as first step in a more general research agenda , outlined in sec .",
    "[ section - discussion ] .",
    "there are many formulations of privacy - preserving computation , both exact and approximate , that are not based on the definitions and tools in  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly review some of them and explain how they differ from ours .",
    "the most extensively developed approach to privacy in distributed computation is that of _ secure , multiparty function evaluation _ ( smfe ) . indeed ,",
    "to achieve agent privacy in algorithmic mechanism design , which was our original motivation , one could , in principle , simply start with a strategyproof mechanism and then have the agents themselves compute the outcome and payments using an smfe protocol .",
    "however , as observed by brandt and sandholm  @xcite , these protocols fall into two main categories , and both have inherent disadvantages from the point of view of mechanism design :    * _ information - theoretically _ private protocols , the study of which was initiated by ben - or , goldwasser , and wigderson  @xcite and chaum , crpeau , and damgaard  @xcite , rely on the assumption that a constant fraction of the agents are `` honest '' ( or `` obedient '' in the terminology of distributed algorithmic mechanism design  @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ , that they follow the protocol perfectly even if they know that doing so will lead to an outcome that is not as desirable to them as one that would result from their deviating from the protocol ; clearly , this assumption is antithetical to the main premise of mechanism design , which is that all agents will behave strategically , deviating from protocols when and only when doing so will improve the outcome from their points of view ; * multiparty protocols that use _ cryptography _ to achieve privacy , the study of which was initiated by yao  @xcite , rely on ( plausible but currently unprovable ) complexity - theoretic assumptions .",
    "often , they are also very communication - intensive ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for an explanation of why some of the deficiencies of the vickrey auction can not be solved via cryptography ) . moreover , sometimes the deployment cryptographic machinery is infeasible ( over the years , many cryptographic variants of the current interdomain routing protocol , bgp , were proposed , but not deployed due to the infeasibility of deploying a global internet - wide pki infrastructure and the real - time computational cost of verifying signatures ) .",
    "for some mechanisms of interest , efficient cryptographic protocols have been obtained ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    in certain scenarios ,",
    "the demand for _ perfect _ privacy preservation can not be relaxed . in such cases ,",
    "if the function can not be computed in a privacy - preserving manner without the use of cryptography , there is no choice but to resort to a cryptographic protocol .",
    "there is an extensive body of work on cryptography - based identity protocols , and we are not offering our notion of par as an extension of that work .",
    "( in fact , the framework described here might be applied to smfe protocols by replacing indistinguishability by computational indistinguishability . however",
    ", this does not appear to yield any new insights . )    however , in other cases , we argue that privacy preservation should be regarded as one of _ several design goals _ , alongside low computational / communication complexity , protocol simplicity , incentive - compatibility , and more .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to be able to _ quantify _ privacy preservation in order to understand the tradeoffs among the different design goals , and obtain `` reasonable '' ( but not necessarily perfect ) privacy guarantees .",
    "our par approach continues the long line of research about information - theoretic notions of privacy , initiated by ben - or _",
    "et al_.  and by chaum _ et al_.regardless of the above argument",
    ", we believe that information - theoretic formulations of privacy and approximate privacy are also natural to consider in their own right .",
    "in this paper , we consider protocols that compute exact results but preserve privacy only approximately .",
    "one can also ask what it means for a protocol to compute approximate results in a privacy - preserving manner ; indeed , this question has also been studied  @xcite , but it is unrelated to the questions we ask here .",
    "similarly , definitions and techniques from _ differential privacy _",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , in which the goal is to add noise to the result of a database query in such a way as to preserve the privacy of the individual database records ( and hence protect the data subjects ) but still have the result convey nontrivial information , are inapplicable to the problems that we study here .      in the next section ,",
    "we review and expand upon the connection between perfect privacy and communication complexity .",
    "we present our formulations of approximate privacy , both worst case and average case , in section  [ sec_approximate - privacy - def ] ; we present our main results in sections  [ section - bounds - i ] and  [ section - bounds - ii ] .",
    "discussion and future directions can be found in section  [ section - discussion ] .",
    "we now briefly review yao s model of two - party communication and notions of objective and subjective perfect privacy ; see kushilevitz and nisan  @xcite for a comprehensive overview of communication complexity theory .",

    "deterministic _ communication protocols .",
