    "in galactic dynamics , the term chaos refers to the exponential divergence of initially nearby orbits in phase space . in non ",
    "integrable systems , initially nearby stars in strong chaotic regions drift away from each other very quickly , thus losing memory of their common origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "understanding whether this physical process plays a major role in shaping the stellar phase space distribution of the solar neighbourhood is of key importance , as it is within this distribution that we hope to gain a significant insight into the formation history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the characterisation of the formation history of our own galaxy is a very ambitious undertaking by modern astronomy @xcite .",
    "understanding how the milky way evolved to become the galaxy we currently inhabit would allow us not only to explore our origins , but also to understand galaxy formation in a more general context @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it can allow us to test the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this theory predicts that the present  day population of galaxies grew in mass by merging with smaller companions . as their potential wells grew deeper , galaxies continued to accrete gas that cooled , collapsed into a disk , and gave rise to most of their stellar component @xcite .",
    "in addition to this in ",
    "situ population , every galaxy is predicted to have a minor fraction of its stellar content associated with merger events @xcite .",
    "the tidal force that a satellite experiences as it orbits its host may be strong enough to disrupt it significantly . as a result of this interaction , initially spatially coherent and extended stellar streams are formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these streams are thus fossil signatures of this formation process and their identification is key to reconstructing the merger history of our galaxy .",
    "stellar streams associated with the most ancient accretion events are expected to populate the inner galactic regions , in particular the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , dynamical times in these regions are relatively short and streams tend to mix rapidly , losing their spatial coherence @xcite .",
    "even though galaxies are essentially collisionless @xcite , and thus streams become more clustered in velocity as they diffuse in configuration space , statistically significant phase space overdensities are needed to identify such streams in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "clearly , the longer it takes for a stream to diffuse in configuration space , the larger the chances of identifying it in phase space .",
    "the rate at which a stellar stream spatially dissolves depends not only on the orbit of its progenitor satellite , but also on the properties of the host galactic potential @xcite . in a galactic potential where a stream is on a regular orbit , its local",
    "density decreases in time as a power law , thus relatively slowly .",
    "yet the current paradigm of galaxy formation predicts strongly triaxial and cuspy dark matter haloes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these two characteristics are known to be a significant source of chaos in a galactic potential @xcite . on a chaotic orbit ,",
    "the local stream density decreases at an exponential rate .",
    "furthermore , chaotic orbits can significantly drift in the space of quantities that are otherwise approximately conserved , such as angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus hindering its identification at the present day .",
    "one of the main goals of ongoing and past astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic missions is to map the stellar phase space distribution in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in addition to _ gaia _",
    "@xcite , which will measure positions and velocities of more than a thousand million stars , several other projects have provided and will continue to provide complementary information ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a meaningful interpretation of the degree of substructure found in the solar neighbourhood requires a deep understanding of the role that chaotic mixing plays in shaping the underlying substructure s phase space distribution .",
    "since the identification and characterisation of chaotic orbits is a fundamental step towards this goal , efficient and accurate tools for this purpose are essential . a seminal contribution to the field of chaos detection",
    "was made by lyapunov @xcite when he introduced the idea behind the so  called lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lces ) .",
    "lces are theoretical quantities that provide a measure of the rate of local exponential divergence of two initially nearby orbits in phase space .",
    "thus , the lces are a very convenient way to distinguish between chaotic and regular motion and , particularly , to characterise chaos .",
    "of particular importance is the largest lce ( llce ) , which is the lce in the direction for which these two orbits diverge most rapidly . theoretically , the characterisation of an orbit according to its llce is done based on its asymptotic behaviour at infinity",
    ". the lyapunov indicator ( li ) , on the other hand , refers to the finite  time version of the llce .",
    "a numerical value of the li very close to zero indicates regular behaviour whereas any positive value indicates chaotic motion .",
    "the inverse of the li provides a measure of the timescale for the manifestation of the exponential divergence . in practice ,",
    "numerical finite ",
    "time techniques based on the concept of local exponential divergence like the li ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are commonly considered to be chaos indicators .    nowadays",
    ", there are many chaos indicators in the literature that were developed based on the idea of the lces . among the most used and tested indicators we find the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reliability shown by the fli in previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes this chaos indicator an ideal tool to characterise the role of chaos in solar neighbourhood  like volumes .    in this work",
    "we will take advantage of a variant of the fli , the so  called orthogonal fast lyapunov indicator ( ofli ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to evaluate the importance of chaos and chaotic mixing in shaping the phase space distribution of halo stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we describe the models and the techniques in section  [ sec : methodology ] and include a short but comprehensive characterisation of the behaviours of the ofli in section  [ sec : meth - ind - bridge ] . in section  [ sec : relevance ] we present our results on the actual impact of chaos in erasing local signatures of accretion events on the stellar halo phase space and revise the widespread assumption that chaos must inevitably lead to diffusion .",
    "we discuss and summarise our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix we include a brief introduction to the concept of local exponential divergence , the definition of the li and a more formal description of the phenomenon of stickiness and sticky orbits .",
    "in this section we introduce the simulations and numerical tools used to characterise the chaotic nature of the stellar halo phase space distribution enclosed within solar neighbourhood  like volumes .",
    "we use five high  resolution , fully cosmological @xmath0body simulations of the formation of milky way ( mw)like dark matter ( dm ) haloes carried out using the parallel tree ",
    "pm code gadget3 ( an upgraded version of gadget2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by the _ aquarius project",
    "each halo was first identified within a large cosmological periodic box of 100 @xmath1 mpc a side @xcite and then re  simulated using a multi mass particle zoom  in technique .",
    "these dm  only simulations were performed using the following cosmological parameters : matter ( dark and baryon ) density , @xmath2 ; dark energy density , @xmath3 ; normalisation of the power matter spectrum , @xmath4 ; scalar spectral index , @xmath5 and hubble constant , @xmath6 km s@xmath7mpc@xmath8 km s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , consistent with wmap 1 and 5year constraints @xcite .",
    "the dm haloes for the _ aquarius project _ were selected to have masses @xmath9m@xmath10 , comparable to the mw , and to be relatively isolated at @xmath11 .",
    "they were identified using a friends  of  friends @xcite algorithm and self  bound subhaloes were identified with subfind @xcite .",
    "each mw  like dm halo was re  simulated at a series of progressively higher resolutions .",
    "the experiments presented in this work are based on the simulations with the second highest resolution available , and their main properties are presented in table  [ table : aquarius ] . for a more detailed description of the simulations ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the phase space distribution of halo stars in the neighbourhood of the sun potentially holds an invaluable source of information about the assembly history of the milky way .",
    "stellar streams are the most direct signals of galactic accretion and their identification in the solar neighbourhood is of fundamental importance to the study of galactic dynamics",
    ". our capability to detect these stellar streams might be threatened by local chaotic mixing processes that can smooth out the phase space distribution function on a very short timescale ( section  [ sec : introduction ] ) . in this work",
    "we have explored whether chaotic mixing can play an important role in shaping the phase space distribution of orbits local to the present position of the sun our results reinforces the idea that this process is very inefficient within a physically meaningful timescale , even within the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the degree of substructure in the solar neighbourhood s phase space distribution depends on several factors .",
    "first , dynamical timescales in the inner regions of the galaxy are relatively short . in general , stellar streams within this region are expected to be spatially well ",
    "mixed @xcite .",
    "in addition , due ( at least ) to the triaxial and cuspy nature of the underlying gravitational potential , a fraction of local streams could be evolving on chaotic orbits .",
    "chaos , in the lyapunov sense , indicates exponential divergence of initially nearby orbits in phase space .",
    "stream stars with chaotic orbits would experience very rapid mixing , with local spatial densities decreasing at an exponential rate such that their detection at the present day would be unlikely .",
    "furthermore , regions filled with chaotic orbits can foster chaotic diffusion , which erases the ` dynamical memory ' imprinted in phase space and effectively produces a smooth distribution function ( section  [ subsubsec : form ] ) .",
    "we have shown that , even though all of these processes are undoubtedly active in the solar neighbourhood , they do not necessarily imply a significantly smooth phase space distribution function .",
    "one of the key factors in this discussion is the relevant timescale of the system , which serves as an upper bound for the actual time available to develop chaos .",
    "in particular , the ( dark matter halo ) potential in the inner 20 kpc of the galaxy is not expected to have evolved significantly within the last @xmath12 gyr ( @xmath13 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency of chaos should be evaluated with regard to this timeframe .    to characterise the true impact of chaos in shaping local stellar halo phase space structure , we used fully cosmological @xmath0body simulations of the formation of milky way  like dark matter haloes , coupled with a semi  analytic model of galaxy formation ( section  [ subsec : meth - sim ] ) , to sample the phase space distribution of solar neighbourhood  like volumes ( section  [ subsec : meth - init ] ) .",
    "we modelled the dark matter halo potential with a triaxial extension of the well  known nfw density profile ( section  [ subsec : meth - pot ] ) and used it to integrate the equations of motion , coupled with the first variational equations , to compute the orthogonal fast lyapunov indicator , ofli ( section  [ subsec : meth - ind - ofli ] ) .",
    "this chaos indicator allowed us to robustly characterise the dynamical nature of stellar particles .",
    "orbits were classified into three different components : regular , sticky and chaotic .",
    "an important difference between these three families is the rate at which the local ( stream ) density around a given particle decreases as a function of time .",
    "while for regular orbits the local density decreases as a power law , for chaotic orbits it does so at an exponential rate . in between",
    "we find the so called sticky orbits .",
    "sticky orbits behave as regular for a given period of time , after which their behaviour becomes chaotic .    in all solar neighbourhood  like volumes analysed we find that , even within these strongly triaxial potentials , only @xmath14 of the stellar particles reveal their chaotic nature within a hubble time .",
    "we find that @xmath15 of orbits can be characterised as regular .",
    "for the remaining @xmath16 , namely ` sticky ' orbits , it takes in general much longer than 10 gyr to reveal their chaotic behaviour .",
    "the fraction of sticky orbits is particularly important because , for halo stars moving on such orbits , chaotic mixing may not have enough time to operate even though the orbits themselves have an intrinsically chaotic nature .",
    "it is important to mention that , in all cases , we have considered a simplified representation of the underlying galactic potentials . to explore whether this approximation could affect our results , orbits of the stellar particles associated with the aq ",
    "local volume were integrated on potentials with axis ratios extracted from the remaining four dark matter haloes . in all cases",
    ", we kept the virial mass and concentration parameters fixed to those associated with halo aq  a2 .",
    "if our results would be highly sensitive to the shape of the potential , this change to the triaxiality should significantly increase the fraction of chaotic orbits .",
    "in all cases we find that the fraction of orbits presenting chaotic behaviour within 10 gyr is @xmath17% .",
    "the obtained fractions are very similar to the one obtained with the axis ratio extracted self  consistently from the dark matter halo aq ",
    "this indicates that , as long as the main sources of chaos are included in the model ( i.e. , central cusp , triaxial shape and its radial dependence ) , slight variations of the galactic potential should not dramatically alter the global dynamics of the system .",
    "our results indicates that chaotic mixing , although non  negligible , is not a significant factor in erasing local signatures of accretion events .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of g13 , who quantified the number of stellar streams in the same solar neighbourhood  like volumes considered in this work .",
    "their results suggest that the strongest limitation on quantifying substructure is mass resolution , rather than diffusion due to chaotic mixing .",
    "they found that , in the best  resolved local volumes , the number of identifiable streams ranges from @xmath18 to 600 , in very good agreement with previous analytic predictions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the orbital classification presented in g13 most likely overestimates the fraction of stellar particles moving on chaotic orbits . as a consequence of the high but still finite particle resolution of these simulations",
    ", g13 were forced to track the time evolution of local ( stream ) densities within relatively large spheres ( @xmath19 kpc ) . as shown in this work ,",
    "such large spheres are likely to encompass stellar particles that exhibit very different dynamical behaviours , and hence do not faithfully represent the time evolution of their corresponding local densities .    despite the optimistic view described above",
    ", some relevant caveats of the present work must be discussed and addressed in follow  up work .",
    "first of all , the galactic potentials considered in this work are associated only to the underlying distribution of dark matter . in a more realistic model , this potential should also account for the mass distributions of the galactic disc , bulge and a supermassive central black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that previous studies including multi  component galactic potentials have successfully identified large amounts of substructure in solar neighbourhood  like volumes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , studies based on stellar haloes obtained from fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations find an overall fraction of chaotic orbits that , in all cases , is @xmath14 , in agreement with our results @xcite .",
    "we have also considered static potentials that are not allowed to evolve as a function of time . while an evolving potential could enhance the efficiency of diffusion in phase space",
    "( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , previous attempts to characterise the degree of substructure in local volumes , taking into account the variation of the galactic potential in a cosmological context , have suggested that this effect may not be significant after all .",
    "as previously discussed , at least within its inner regions , the galactic potential is not expected to have evolved significantly during the last @xmath12 gyr .",
    "we will further explore the validity of the assumptions adopted in this work in a follow  up study ( cincotta et al .",

    "the chaos indicators , which are based on the time evolution of the deviation or tangent vector to the flux describing a given dynamical system , measure the rate of divergence of two initially close solutions . in order to quantify the rate of divergence of such two nearby orbits ,",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian system defined on a differentiable manifold , the energy surface in the present case .",
    "if we denote by @xmath20 the hamiltonian with @xmath21 , the energy surface is thus defined by @xmath22 . further , on introducing the notation    @xmath23    the equations of motion can be recast as : @xmath24 so that the first variational equations take the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the deviation vector and @xmath27 denotes the jacobian matrix of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 ( an orbit ) denote a solution of for the initial condition @xmath30 .",
    "introducing some norm in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we denote @xmath33 which characterises the hamiltonian flow in a small neighbourhood of @xmath29",
    ". therefore the mean local rate at which nearby orbits to @xmath29 diverge is given by the largest lyapunov characteristic exponent ( llce ) , defined as : @xmath34 the llce allows to determine whether an orbit is regular or chaotic ( that is , stable or unstable in the lyapunov sense ) . indeed , only when the @xmath35 increases exponentially fast with time the llce would be different from zero .",
    "the inverse of the llce , the lyapunov time , provides the timescale for the manifestation of the local instability ( that is to say the time needed for two nearby orbits to diverge by a factor of one @xmath36folding ) . whether @xmath37 is null or positive ,",
    "@xmath38 is said to be regular or chaotic , respectively .",
    "the numerical value of the llce for a large but finite time @xmath39 , is the so  called lyapunov indicator ( li ) , which is the most widely used technique of chaos detection .",
    "clearly the li is a finite  time approximation of @xmath37 given by eq .  .",
    "therefore , a given orbit will be classified as either regular or chaotic whether @xmath40 converges to zero or to a positive value , respectively .",
    "the inverse of the @xmath40 is the finite  time approximation to the above defined lyapunov time ( a detailed discussion on the theory and numerical computation of the lyapunov characteristic exponents and , particularly of the llce , can be found in the extensive review of * ? ? ?",
    "since sticky orbits are important in the present study , we briefly recap their typical behaviour .",
    "the phenomenon of stickiness is clearly seen in near  integrable hamiltonian systems with low  to  moderate perturbations . in this direction ,",
    "the kam theory ( for a non  rigorous approach see for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ensures that most of the original tori associated with the integrable system survive in the presence of a sufficiently small perturbation .",
    "these are the irrational tori , those that satisfy the so  called diophantine condition .",
    "meanwhile , tori close to a resonance condition are destroyed , leading to unstable chaotic motion . in systems with two degrees of freedom , the two  dimensional invariant tori divide the energy surface ( of dimension 3 ) . for systems of higher dimensionality",
    "the scenario is much more complicated , since , for instance the kam tori no longer divide the energy surface and the stickiness phenomena , although still present , requires further explanation .",
    "therefore , chaotic orbits can not enter a ( resonant ) stability domain due to the presence of an invariant curve that act as a barrier for chaotic motion and so remain confined to a finite width stochastic layer around the island . by slightly increasing the perturbation strength ,",
    "invariant curves can be broken down and the barriers become only quasi  barriers to chaotic motion .",
    "this is due to the intricate structure of the former invariant curves @xcite , an infinite set of unconnected infinitesimal parts of the earlier curve , strictly speaking a cantor set or cantori ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a qualitative description ) . therefore , chaotic orbits starting in a large chaotic domain could in general avoid the cantori .",
    "meanwhile , a chaotic orbit with initial conditions close enough to the cantori might cross the quasi ",
    "barriers of the cantorus and stick to the stability island associated with the resonant orbit .",
    "hence , that chaotic orbit would mimic a regular one in the island .",
    "such a chaotic orbit is called ` sticky  chaotic ' or simply ` sticky ' . in general ,",
    "sticky orbits are trapped within thin chaotic layers and might visit the neighbourhood of different stability islands for a rather long time before they escape ( through the cantori ) into the chaotic sea ( in the context of poincar surfaces of section ) .",
    "a sticky orbit therefore looks like a regular orbit for a rather long time , until its chaotic nature is clearly exposed  in other words its chaos onset time is relatively large ."
