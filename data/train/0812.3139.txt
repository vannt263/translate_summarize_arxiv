    "the fine structure constant @xmath1 is the fundamental physical constant characterizing the strength of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is a dimensionless quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the system of units used .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the permittivity of vacuum , _ c _ is the speed of light , _ e _ is the electron charge and _ @xmath6 _ is the reduced planck constant .",
    "the fine structure constant is a key of the adjustment of the fundamental physical constants .",
    "the different measurements of @xmath1 are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig : alpha2008 ] .",
    "these values are obtained from experiments in different domains of physics , as the quantum hall effect and josephson effect in solid state physics , or the measurement of the muonium hyperfine structure in atomic physics .",
    "the most precise determinations of @xmath1 are deduced from the measurements of the electron anomaly @xmath7 made in the eighties at the university of washington @xcite and , recently , at harvard . this last experiment and",
    "an impressive improvement of qed calculations have lead to a new determination of @xmath1 with a relative uncertainty of @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless this last determination of @xmath1 relies on very difficult qed calculations . to test it ,",
    "other determinations of @xmath1 are required , such as the values deduced from the measurements of @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass of cesium and rubidium atoms ) which are also indicated on the figure [ fig : fig : alpha2008 ] . in this paper , we present the measurements of @xmath10 made in paris in 2005 and 2008",
    ".    the principle of our experiment is the measurement of the recoil velocity @xmath13 of a rubidium atom absorbing or emitting a photon ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the wave vector of the photon absorbed by the atom of mass @xmath16 ) .",
    "as the relative atomic masses @xmath17 are measured very precisely , the measurement of @xmath10 is a way to determine accurately @xmath1 via the rydberg constant @xmath18 : @xmath19 in this equation , the relative atomic mass of the electron @xmath20 and the rubidium @xmath21 are known with the relative uncertainties of @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "as the fractional uncertainty of @xmath18 is @xmath24 , the factor limiting the accuracy of @xmath1 is the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "the principle of the experiment is to coherently transfer as many recoils as possible to the atoms ( _ i.e. _ to accelerate them ) and to measure the final velocity distribution . in our experiment ,",
    "the atoms are efficiently accelerated by means of @xmath25 bloch oscillations ( bo ) .",
    "the velocity selection and velocity measurement are done with raman transitions .",
    "the experiment develops in three steps .",
    "i ) firstly , we select from a cold atomic cloud of @xmath26 a bunch of atoms with a very narrow velocity distribution . this selection is performed by a doppler velocity sensitive counter - propagating raman transition . in 2005",
    ", we have used a @xmath27-pulse to transfer the atoms from the @xmath28 to the @xmath29 hyperfine levels of @xmath26 . in 2008 ,",
    "we have modified the experimental scheme to take advantage of ramsey spectroscopy : we use a pair of @xmath30 pulses which produces a fringe pattern in the velocity space .",
    "ii ) secondly , we transfer to these selected atoms as many recoils as possible by means of bloch oscillations as explained later .",
    "iii ) finally , we measure the final velocity of the atoms by a second raman transition which transfers the atoms from the @xmath29 to the @xmath28 hyperfine level . in short ,",
    "we have used two different pulse sequences , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 configurations .",
    "the accuracy of our measurement of the recoil velocity relies in the number of recoils ( @xmath33 ) that we are able to transfer to the atoms .",
    "indeed , if we measure the final velocity with an accuracy of @xmath34 , the accuracy on the recoil velocity measurement @xmath35 is : @xmath36    bloch oscillations have been first observed in atomic physics by the groups of salomon in paris and raizen in austin . in a simple way",
    ", bloch oscillations can be seen as raman transitions where the atom begins and ends in the same energy level , so that its internal state ( @xmath29 for @xmath26 ) is unchanged while its velocity has increased by @xmath37 per bloch oscillation .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : parabole ] which shows the atomic kinetic energy versus the atomic momentum . the velocity distribution obtained after the @xmath38 selection is also represented .",
    "bloch oscillations are produced in a one dimensional optical lattice which is accelerated by linearly sweeping the relative frequency of two counter propagating laser beams ( frequencies @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the frequency difference @xmath41 is increased so that , because of the doppler effect , the beams are periodically resonant with the same atoms ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the recoil energy in frequency units and @xmath45 the number of transitions ) .",
    "this leads to a succession of rapid adiabatic passages between momentum states differing by @xmath46 . in the solid - state physics approach",
    ", this phenomenon is known as bloch oscillations in the fundamental energy band of a periodic optical potential .",
    "the atoms are subject to a constant inertial force obtained by the introduction of the tunable frequency difference @xmath41 between the two waves that create the optical potential @xcite .",
    "we now describe the acceleration process following the bloch formalism .",
    "if , after the selection , the atom has a well defined momentum @xmath47 with @xmath48 , the atomic wave function is modified when the optical potential is increased adiabatically ( without acceleration ) and becomes in the first energy band : @xmath49 with @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 designs the ket associated to a plane wave of momentum @xmath52 and the amplitudes @xmath53 correspond to the wannier function @xcite in momentum space of the first band .",
    "when the potential depth is close to zero , the limit of the wannier function @xmath53 is 1 over the first brillouin zone and zero outside . on the contrary , if the potential depth is large , the wannier function selects several components in the velocity space .",
    "when the optical lattice is accelerated adiabatically , the wannier function is continuously shifted in the momentum space following the relation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the velocity of the optical lattice .",
    "the enveloping wannier function @xmath56 is shifted by @xmath57 in momentum space .",
    "after the acceleration , the potential depth is decreased adiabatically and , in equation [ wannier1 ] , the wannier function selects only one component of the velocity distribution . at the end ,",
    "the wave function is @xmath58 . if @xmath59 is the velocity variation due to the acceleration , the number of bloch oscillations @xmath25 is such as @xmath60 . consequently , if the initial atomic velocity distribution fits the first brillouin zone , it is exactly shifted by @xmath61 without deformation , as it is shown , on fig .",
    "[ fig : parabole ] , for the velocity distribution produced by a pair of @xmath30 pulses .",
    "our experimental setup has been previously described in detail . briefly",
    ", we use a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and an optical molasses to cool the atoms to about @xmath62 .",
    "the determination of the velocity distribution is performed using a @xmath63 pulses sequence of two vertical counter - propagating laser beams ( raman beams ) @xcite : the first pulse with a fixed frequency @xmath64 , transfers atoms from @xmath65 , @xmath66 state to @xmath65 , @xmath67 state , into a narrow velocity class ( width of about @xmath68 ) .",
    "then a laser beam resonant with the @xmath69 to @xmath70 cycling transition pushes away the atoms remaining in the ground state @xmath28 .",
    "atoms in the state @xmath29 make @xmath25 bloch oscillations in a vertical accelerated optical lattice .",
    "we then perform the final velocity measurement using the second raman @xmath27-pulse , whose frequency is @xmath71 .",
    "the populations of the @xmath29 and @xmath28 levels are measured separately by using a time of flight technique . to plot the final velocity distribution we repeat this procedure by scanning the raman beam frequency @xmath71 of the second pulse .    to avoid spontaneous emission and to reduce other stray effects ( light shifts and refraction index ) , the raman lasers and the optical lattice are blue detuned by @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively from the one photon transition .",
    "the delay between the two @xmath27-pulses is @xmath74 ms and their duration @xmath75 ms .",
    "the optical potential depth is @xmath76 . for an acceleration of about @xmath77 we transfer about @xmath78 recoil momenta in @xmath79  ms with an efficiency greater than @xmath80 per recoil . to avoid atoms from reaching the upper windows of the vacuum chamber , we use a double acceleration scheme : instead of selecting atoms at rest , we first accelerate them using bloch oscillations and then we make the three steps sequence : selection - acceleration - measurement .",
    "this way , the atomic velocity at the measurement step is close to zero . in order to eliminate the effect of gravity",
    ", we make a differential measurement by accelerating the atoms in opposite directions ( up and down trajectories ) keeping the same delay between the selection and measurement @xmath27-pulses .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 can then be deduced from the formula : @xmath82 where @xmath83 corresponds respectively to the center of the final velocity distribution for the up and the down trajectories , @xmath84 are the number of bloch oscillations in both opposite directions , @xmath85 is the bloch wave vector and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the wave vectors of the raman beams .",
    "moreover , the contribution of some systematic effects ( energy level shifts ) is inverted when the direction of the raman beams are exchanged : for each up or down trajectory , the raman beams directions are reversed and we record two velocity spectra .",
    "finally , each determination of @xmath10 and @xmath1 is obtained from 4 velocity spectra .",
    "[ fig : spectre1 ] shows two velocity spectra for the up and down trajectories .",
    "the determinations of @xmath88 and @xmath1 have been derived from 72 experimental data point taken during four days . in these measurements ,",
    "the number of bloch oscillations were @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then , the effective recoil number is @xmath91=1780 .",
    "the dispersion of these n=72 measurements is @xmath92 and the resulting statistical relative uncertainty on @xmath10 is @xmath93 .",
    "this corresponds to a relative statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 of @xmath94 .",
    "all systematic effects affecting the experimental measurement have been analyzed in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "the total correction due to the systematic effects is @xmath95 on the determination of @xmath10 . with this correction",
    ", we obtain for @xmath1 : @xmath96\\ ] ] this value of the fine structure constant is labeled @xmath97 on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig : alpha2008 ] .",
    "we describe in this section the results obtained in the @xmath32 configuration .",
    "the scheme of this interferometric method is shown on fig . [",
    "fig : interferometre ] .",
    "the frequency resolution is now determined by the time @xmath98 within each pair of pulses while the duration of each @xmath30 pulse determines the spectral width of the pulses and the number of atoms which contribute to the signal .",
    "this interferometer is similar to the one of the reference @xcite , except that effective ramsey @xmath15-wavevectors point in the same direction .",
    "consequently , this interferometer is not sensitive to the recoil energy , but only to the velocity variation due to bloch oscillations which take place between the two sets of @xmath30 pulses .    as in the @xmath31 configuration ,",
    "a value of @xmath10 is deduced from four spectra obtained with the upwards or downwards acceleration and by exchanging the directions of the raman beams .",
    "an example of two spectra is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre2 ] . in this case , the total number of bloch oscillations is @xmath99 , corresponding to @xmath100 recoil velocities between the up and down trajectories .",
    "the duration of each @xmath30 pulse is @xmath101s and the time @xmath98 is @xmath102 ms ( the total time of a pair of @xmath30 pulses is @xmath75 ms ) . for these experiments ,",
    "the blue detuning of the raman lasers is @xmath103 ghz . by comparison with the @xmath31 configuration",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre1 ] ) the resolution is better : the half period of the fringes is about @xmath104 hz when the line width of the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre1 ] was about @xmath105 hz .",
    "nevertheless , the reduction of the uncertainties is not in the same ratio .",
    "this is due to the phase noise of the raman laser which becomes more important . to lower this effect ,",
    "we have set up an active anti vibration system : then the precision of each frequency measurement increases by about a factor of two .",
    "after this amelioration , to improve the resolution , it is tempting to increase the time @xmath98 between the @xmath30 pulses",
    ". nevertheless , another limitation appears , which is the size of the vacuum cell .",
    "indeed , when we make the selection , the velocity of the atoms is close to @xmath61 and , during the selection , the atom travels a distance of @xmath106 .",
    "for example , in the case of the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre2 ] , the total displacement of the atoms is about @xmath107 mm and @xmath108 mm for the down and up trajectories ( the upper window of the vacuum cell is @xmath109 mm above the center of the cell ) : practically , with the parameters corresponding to the spectra of fig . [",
    "fig : spectre2 ] , we use all the size of the cell . consequently ,",
    "if we want to increase the delay @xmath98 , we have to reduce the number @xmath25 of bloch oscillations and there is no benefit .    to surpass this limit ,",
    "we have developed a method , called _ atomic elevator _ , to better use the volume of the vacuum cell .",
    "the idea is to move the atoms to the top or the bottom of the cell before making the sequence described above .",
    "then , we use the total size of the cell to accelerate and decelerate the atoms . to displace the atoms ,",
    "we accelerate the atoms with @xmath110 bloch oscillations during @xmath111 ms and , after a dead time of @xmath112 ms , we decelerate the atoms with @xmath110 bloch oscillations . this sequence displaces the atoms by about @xmath113 mm . with this technique ,",
    "we have increased at the same time @xmath25 to @xmath114 and @xmath98 to @xmath115 ms .",
    "[ fig : spectre3 ] shows two records obtained with these parameters .",
    "the visibility of the fringes is similar to the one of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre2 ] and the half period of the fringe is about @xmath116 hz .",
    "now the frequency difference between the two spectra corresponds to @xmath117 . during the selection ,",
    "the atomic velocity is about 10 m / s and the atom travels a distance close to 6 cm .",
    "this shows the limitation due to the size of the vacuum cell .",
    "we present now the result deduced from @xmath118 measurements of @xmath10 . for these measurements ,",
    "we have used the two methods described previously , with and without the atomic elevator .",
    "the total number of bloch oscillations @xmath119 varies from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "the dispersion of these @xmath122 measurements is @xmath123 and the resulting relative statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 is @xmath124 .",
    "the systematic effects are similar to the ones described in reference @xcite .",
    "the two main effects are due to the geometry of the laser beams and to the second order zeeman effect .",
    "to evaluate the first effect , we have measured the wave front curvatures with a shack - hartmann wave front analyzer ( haso 128 from imagine optics ) . from these measurements , we have obtained a correction of @xmath125 on the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "as explained above , the effect of parasitic level shifts is eliminated by inverting the direction of the raman beams .",
    "nevertheless , this assumes that the measurements are made exactly at the same position when the direction of the raman beam is inverted .",
    "in fact , these positions are not exactly the same because the directions of the recoils given at the first raman transition are opposite . for the timing used in our experiment ,",
    "they differ by about @xmath126 .",
    "we have precisely measured the spatial magnetic field variations to control this effect .",
    "this correction depends of the number of bloch oscillations .",
    "for example , in the case of the records of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre3 ] , its value is @xmath127 . finally the relative uncertainty due to the systematic effects is @xmath128 and we obtain for @xmath1 : @xmath129\\ ] ] this value corresponds to the point labeled @xmath130 on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig : alpha2008 ] and is in agreement with our 2005 measurement .",
    "our two results are also in agreement with the most precise value deduced from the electron anomaly ( labeled @xmath7(harvard ) on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig : alpha2008 ] ) .",
    "we have presented two determinations of the fine structure constant @xmath1 . depending on the raman pulses arrangement ( @xmath31 or @xmath32 configurations ) , our experiment can run as an atom interferometer or not .",
    "the comparison of the two resulting values , which are in good agreement , provides an accurate test of these methods .",
    "the comparison with the value extracted from the electron anomaly experiment @xcite is either a strong test of qed calculations or , assuming these calculations exact , it gives a limit to test a possible internal structure of the electron .",
    "our goal is now to reduce the relative uncertainty of @xmath1 .",
    "we are building a new experimental setup with a larger vacuum chamber . with the new cell",
    ", we plan to multiply the number of bloch oscillations by a factor of three .",
