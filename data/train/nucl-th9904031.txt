    "computations of pion production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) collisions near threshold , allow a confrontation of our understanding of @xmath4 interactions with data in a kinematic region for which chiral symmetry , and therefore quantum chromodynamics qcd , could be very important .",
    "the reaction @xmath3 near threshold has attracted much attention in the years since the first iucf data appeared @xcite and has exposed serious disagreements with earlier theoretical calculations @xcite . the existence of many conflicting models claiming to explain this discrepancy @xcite calls for a principle to organize the several potentially significant mechanisms of pion production .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) has been applied to mesonic @xcite , one - baryon @xcite , and nuclear @xcite processes where typical momenta of the order of the pion mass , @xmath6 , allow a systematic expansion of observables in powers of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 gev .",
    "et al _ @xcite have adapted the power counting and applied @xmath5pt to near - threshold pion production , where momenta are of order @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the nucleon mass .",
    "they estimated leading and next - to - leading contributions , the latter including important short - range contributions , related to the isoscalar components of the potential ( and possibly described by @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson exchanges ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , van kolck _ et al _ @xcite showed that next - to - next - to - leading contributions ( _ e.g. _ , from @xmath13 meson exchange ) are also relevant ; data could then be explained within the very large theoretical uncertainties associated with @xmath2-wave pion rescattering and the short - range structure of the nuclear force .",
    "other @xmath5pt - inspired calculations have also stressed the importance of understanding rescattering @xcite and the effect of loops @xcite . since these @xmath5pt - inspired calculations include a larger number of contributions than other , model calculations , one concludes that a large theoretical uncertainty plagues all calculations performed to date .",
    "given such uncertainties , it is natural to examine other channels using the same techniques .",
    "here we are going to discuss @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which traditionally have been considered better understood than @xmath3 .",
    "we consider energies near threshold where the calculation simplifies , because the pion emerges mostly in an @xmath2 wave .",
    "we will show that an understanding of these channels is still in the future .",
    "we adopt here the conventional nuclear approach of grouping all @xmath4 interactions generated by mesons of small momentum in a potential , while the contributions associated with energies comparable to @xmath6 are accounted for in a kernel to be evaluated between wavefunctions generated by the potential . splitting the problem this way ,",
    "one should still strive to calculate wavefunctions and kernels from the same theory or model , otherwise ambiguities arise from off - shell extrapolations ( or equivalently , from nucleon - field redefinitions ) .",
    "@xmath5pt is the only known tool for performing this task , and at the same time is consistent with qcd , because its symmetries are treated correctly .",
    "@xmath5pt is also unique in that it offers the possibility of doing systematic calculations : an expansion in momenta provides a power counting to organize the calculation even though coupling constants are not small .",
    "@xmath5pt separates interactions in long - range effects calculated explicitly with pion exchange and short - range effects accounted for by contact interactions with an increasing number of derivatives .",
    "parameters not constrained by chiral symmetry depend on details of qcd dynamics , and are at the present unknown functions of qcd parameters .",
    "predictive power is not lost , however , because at any given order in the power counting only a finite number of unknown parameters appear ; after they are fitted to a finite set of data , all else can be predicted at that order .",
    "these predictions are called `` low - energy theorems '' .",
    "since the lagrangian of @xmath5pt is the most general one consistent with qcd symmetries , @xmath5pt is a generalization of current algebra .",
    "unfortunately , the only @xmath4 potential derived in @xmath5pt @xcite and fitted to low - energy phase shifts @xcite produces poor results near the pion production threshold .",
    "attempts to remedy the situation are in progress @xcite . for the time being we will rely on modern , `` realistic '' phenomenological potentials which fit @xmath4 data very well . by considering more than one of those , we can estimate the otherwise uncontrolled error stemming from our inconsistent use of potential and kernel .",
    "we are going to see that , in contrast to neutral pion production , the error is small in the channel considered here . because such realistic potentials reproduce low - energy phase shifts with identical long - range tails",
    ", they must contain the equivalent to the leading order in the chiral expansion .",
    "although our approach should be considered phenomenological , our leading - order result will be an approximation to a low - energy theorem . at sub - leading orders in the expansion , an apparent ambiguity arises , concerning the correct treatment of the energy transferred in pion rescattering .",
    "this can be seen in the conflicting results of estimates of the same kernel @xcite .",
    "this issue is under study @xcite ; here we will limit ourselves to the most natural prescription that the transferred energy is @xmath16 .",
    "we will concentrate most of our efforts on the kernel .",
    "we will discuss a reasonable power counting for pion production that generalizes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite . in leading order ,",
    "the new ingredient here is pion rescattering using the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term that dominates isospin - dependent @xmath19 scattering .",
    "this term does not contribute to the reaction @xmath20 . in the latter ,",
    "the leading non - vanishing order consists only of an impulse term ( ia ) , in which a single pion is emitted from a nucleon , and a similar contribution from the delta ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this leading order underpredicts the experimental data by a factor of approximately 5 , due to two cancellations not incorporated in our power counting : _ ( i ) _ among different regions in coordinate space for each term evaluated between initial and final wavefunctions ; and _ ( ii ) _ between the total impulse and delta contributions .",
    "( i ) _ results from our present inability to treat the potential and the kernel on the same footing . oversight _",
    "( ii ) _ is somewhat accidental , but actually expected from the fact that , in energy , the pion threshold sits midway between the elastic threshold and the delta pole .",
    "the sensitivity of the delta contribution to the realistic potential used is the main source of dependence on the @xmath4 potential of the final result .    as a consequence of the accidentally small leading order , effects which are usually negligible",
    "acquire prominence in neutral pion production in the @xmath21 reaction .",
    "one effect is isospin - independent pion rescattering .",
    "@xmath5pt is critically necessary to assess the size of this contribution .",
    "first , in principle @xmath5pt allows one to determine from @xmath19 data not only the momentum- and energy - independent @xmath22 vertex , but also terms which are quadratic in energy and momentum .",
    "this is important in view of the fact that in pion production the virtual pion has energy of order @xmath23 and the combination of parameters of relevance is thus different from the combination that appears at the @xmath19 scattering threshold .",
    "there is by now a number of consistent estimates of the relevant parameters to third order @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the uncertainty of this contribution to pion production can be made by using also a lower - order determination @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath5pt is the only way to account for rescattering as a component of a feynman diagram without destroying chiral symmetry .",
    "there have been attempts to estimate rescattering by simply connecting a nucleon line to a @xmath19 amplitude with an arbitrary off - shell extension @xcite . by considering field redefinitions in the most general chiral lagrangian ,",
    "it is easy to show that the off - shell ambiguity in the pion leg is equivalent to a set of short - range @xmath24 interactions , and that an inconsistent treatment of both effects leads to violation of chiral symmetry in a way that is contradictory with qcd @xcite .",
    "using @xmath5pt , it was found @xcite that rescattering interferes destructively with the leading - order effects in @xmath20 .",
    "this further interference makes agreement with data more difficult .",
    "although the magnitude of the effect is still being assessed @xcite , it is certain that the uncertainty stemming from different determinations of the @xmath5pt parameters is large @xcite .",
    "this disagreement between theoretical evaluations and cross - section data for @xmath20 can be largely removed if @xmath11 , @xmath25 and other heavy mesons are included @xcite .",
    "when first suggested @xcite , it looked as if @xmath20 was a clear signal of these otherwise elusive mechanisms . among the first corrections in our power counting ,",
    "one finds two - pion - exchange loop graphs and @xmath24 counterterms ( that behave properly under chiral symmetry ) . a full @xmath5pt calculation requires the calculation of these loops , and although some steps have been taken in this direction @xcite , it is a herculean task that remains to be completed .",
    "even then , it will still require that the counterterms be fitted to some pion production data ( say , right at threshold ) so that other data ( say , the energy dependence close to threshold , or other channels ) be predicted .",
    "in the case of @xmath20 , even the most sophisticated phenomenological models have to recourse to such a fit of a short - range counterterm @xcite . in any case , after all this one would then be interested in determining whether such counterterms are of natural size , and whether they can be further understood as the result of heavy - meson exchange . in view of all other uncertainties , the authors of ref",
    "@xcite took the point of view that an estimate of this class of sub - leading contributions could more easily be made by modeling them with meson exchange in z - graphs , following ref .",
    "it turns out that the counterterms so produced are of natural size , which lends them credence , but that they are not sufficient to achieve agreement with data . in order to study convergence , further meson exchanges ( chiefly @xmath13 ) that contribute to higher - order counterterms",
    "were considered , and shown to be smaller but still relevant @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of ref.@xcite was that it is possible to describe the @xmath20 reaction consistently with qcd , reasonable meson exchanges , and realistic potentials , but only within a very large theoretical uncertainty .",
    "it is our intention to assess here our theoretical understanding of the @xmath26 reactions by analyzing the effect of the same microscopic mechanisms .",
    "these reactions have been studied for some time .",
    "conservation of parity , angular momentum , and isospin constrains the possible channels for these reactions . in the case of unbound final nucleons , sufficiently close to threshold the strong @xmath2-wave two - nucleon interaction implies that the most important channels should be those in which the final nucleons have relative orbital angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "some of these partial waves are listed in table  [ tab.01 ] .",
    ".partial - wave amplitudes for the @xmath28 reactions that can contribute to the isotropic cross section right at threshold with an @xmath27 final state .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the pion angular momentum . [",

    "the cross section for @xmath36 is related to that of @xmath37 by isospin considerations .",
    "there is a relative factor 2 from @xmath21 being pure isospin @xmath38 and @xmath39 having @xmath38 and @xmath40 in equal probabilities ; and there are coulomb effects .",
    "the total cross - section for the deuteron channels is function of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the maximum pion momentum .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that sufficiently close to threshold the cross - section for @xmath43 is @xmath44 while for @xmath45 it is @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a constant which depends on the strong interactions that produce the pion and @xmath48 is a coulomb factor arising mostly from the pion - deuteron electromagnetic interaction .",
    "if the experimental data for @xmath45 are corrected for these electromagnetic effects , then both reactions near threshold can be viewed as a determination of the single constant @xmath47 .",
    "the threshold behavior of the reaction @xmath49 was estimated by gell - mann and watson @xcite , who predicted an energy dependence @xmath50 under the approximation of zero - range nuclear forces .",
    "early theoretical analyses of the reaction @xmath51 , like in ours , split it into a kernel where the two - nucleon system emits the pion and effects of initial- and final - state interactions taken into account by using deuteron and scattering wave functions that satisfy the schrdinger equation with a given @xmath4 potential .",
    "the numerical results of the early analyses @xcite were that this reaction is dominated by the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]b ) .",
    "the main competitor process was thought to be the impulse term ( ia ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]a ) .",
    "the early estimate of this ia gave a small contribution @xcite due to a cancellation in the matrix elements between the @xmath2 and @xmath35 waves of the deuteron final state .",
    "it was believed that the wt term alone could account for the essential features of the data .",
    "= 13.0 cm = 4.0 cm    with the advent of accelerators capable of producing intense high - quality beams of protons with gev energies and very precise detecting systems , good and accurate data for @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath51 @xcite , and @xmath52 @xcite near threshold became available .",
    "for the deuteron channels , the new data confirm the threshold behavior ( [ snp ] ) @xcite , and show that the theoretical calculations started by koltun and reitan were in the right direction .",
    "more recent calculations of the wt and ia mechanisms @xcite , however , indicated that their strength might not be sufficient to explain the new data .",
    "as for the unbound final state , the recent measurements in the indiana cooler @xcite give @xmath53 a calculation @xcite using ia , on - shell pion rescattering , and @xmath54 z - graphs finds good agreement with data in all @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 channels with a soft @xmath19 form factor .",
    "our motivation here is to examine what a chiral power counting suggests for the pion production in the @xmath58 and @xmath49 reactions near threshold . for the @xmath59 reaction",
    ", we will compute @xmath60 but will disregard the coulomb interaction in both the initial state which is not so important due to the not - so - small initial energy and final state .",
    "this means we do not calculate @xmath48 , and can only compare with coulomb - corrected @xmath21 data .",
    "we will see that @xmath60 is indeed approximately linear with @xmath61 at threshold , so our result can be considered a calculation of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ spp ] ) .",
    "alternatively , it is a calculation of @xmath62 . for the @xmath56 final state , we will also disregard the coulomb interaction and see that our cross section has an energy dependence similar to the data .",
    "moreover , we will show that the wt term is indeed the dominant one , not only for the @xmath63 @xmath56 final state but also for the deuteron channel , which is consistent with the early analyses for this final state .",
    "the ia term is smaller than wt because of cancellations between different regions in coordinate space , and between the @xmath2 and @xmath35 waves of the deuteron final state .",
    "the same cancellations affect the contribution from an explicit @xmath1 in the intermediate state ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]d ) , more so in the @xmath59 channel than in the @xmath64 channel .",
    "the relative smallness of this term here reduces the effects of using different @xmath4 potentials compared to the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "however the delta contribution is affected by a number of uncertainties .",
    "we include also the same sub - leading terms that proved important in the @xmath20 reaction : isospin - independent rescattering ( st , fig .",
    "[ fig.1]b ) , and heavy meson exchange simulating short - range mechanisms ( @xmath54 and @xmath13 , fig .",
    "[ fig.1]c , e ) .",
    "the sub - leading galilean correction to the wt term ( gc ) is included as well .",
    "these contributions are all relatively small .",

    "near threshold for pion production the total energy of the two colliding nucleons is of order @xmath66 , so that the center - of - mass initial kinetic energy of each nucleon is @xmath23 .",
    "this energy is smaller than the nucleon mass , so we can use a non - relativistic framework .",
    "the nonrelativistic kinetic energy formula holds ; the mass @xmath67 plays no dynamical role , and the typical momentum of real and virtual particles involved in this process is @xmath68 .",
    "this requires some adaptation of the usual effective theory ideas which have been developed for momenta typical of most nuclear systems , @xmath69 . because the mass difference between the delta isobar and the nucleon , @xmath70 , is numerically of order of the typical excitation energy we are interested in , @xmath6 , the @xmath1",
    "must be included explicitly as a degree of freedom in the lagrangian .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath71 is smaller than the characteristic mass scale of qcd , @xmath8gev , at least in the chiral limit @xmath72 , so that the contribution of other states ( the roper , the @xmath25 meson , _ etc . _ ) can be buried in short - range interactions .",
    "we thus seek a theory of non - relativistic nucleons and deltas interacting with pions that is consistent with the symmetries of qcd .",
    "@xmath5pt is implemented via the most general lagrangian involving these degrees of freedom aided by power - counting arguments .",

    "second , the @xmath281 form factor seems to be much softer than the corresponding @xmath273 form factor ; our neglecting both enhances the @xmath1 contribution relative to the wt term .",
    "third , we have neglected the @xmath244 mass difference in energies ; since the @xmath1 mass would appear in the denominator , the delta contribution would decrease by a factor of @xmath282 .",
    "fourth , we have neglected the kinetic energy of the delta , account of which would further decrease its amplitude .",
    "fifth , it is known that there can be some cancellation between the pion- and rho - exchange delta terms ; including the latter would also diminish the delta contribution .",
    "assuming each of these gives a 10% decrease , we could very well be overestimating the @xmath1 contribution by 50% or more .",
    "if we neglect this contribution altogether , we obtain the results in fig .",
    "[ fig.22 ] for the cross section in the @xmath74 channel and in fig .",
    "[ fig.23 ] for the cross section in the @xmath217 channel .",
    "this brings theory to underestimate both sets of data by a common factor of @xmath283 .",
    "this implies that there must be further corrections to the amplitude of about 50% .",
    "this is not unlike the @xmath20 reaction considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where theory tends to fail by a similar factor .",
    "the case for failure of theory there is less clear - cut , however , because of the lack of a large contribution as for the wt term here . as a consequence ,",
    "the usually small effect of other mechanisms is enhanced and the result is dominated by shorter - range dynamics ; more sensitivity to the potential and seagull terms surfaces , and it is possible to find a combination of parameters that includes data @xcite .",
    "no such gimmicks work here .",
    "for example , we find that heavy - meson exchange hailed as solution in the @xmath20 reaction does not help much in @xmath284 and @xmath285 , in agreement with the findings in refs . @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the @xmath1 contribution ( which is a particular type of rescattering ) suggests that we need better control over longer - range contributions , such as @xmath19 rescattering and two - pion exchange .",
    "= 13.0 cm    = 13.0 cm",
    "we have calculated the cross section near threshold for the reactions @xmath286 , using a chiral power counting to order interactions .",
    "the interactions included contain most of the interactions found in the literature .",
    "in particular , they include mechanisms used in various models of the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "in contrast to the latter , results here depend relatively little on the wavefunction employed and on short - range interactions .",
    "the weinberg - tomozawa term dominates , but the delta contribution can be important , with large uncertainty .",
    "our computed results typically fall a factor of about two below the data .",
    "our kernels vary as the cube of a generic meson - nucleon coupling constant , so such discrepancy can be parametrized as a 12% deficiency in the coupling constants .",
    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant is known to higher precision than that , but not to much higher precision .",
    "thus the discrepancy we find might not be a very serious problem .",
    "our main conclusion is that a relatively long - range mechanism  such as @xmath19 rescattering and/or two - pion exchange is needed for the description of these reactions .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that advance in understanding pion production in @xmath4 collisions must follow not from the study of @xmath20 by itself as has been the trend of theoretical study to date but from focus on an understanding of long - range effects that afflict all channels .",
