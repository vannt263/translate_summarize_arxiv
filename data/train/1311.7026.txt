    "the concept of _ s - property _ for logarithmic potentials appeared for the first time in the works of h. stahl @xcite , in the study of the limiting distribution of poles of pad approximants , see also @xcite for a recent survey and extension of these results .    inspired by stahl s works ,",
    "gonchar and rakhmanov extended the s - property to situations with external field @xcite .",
    "they then characterized the limiting distribution of zeros of certain _ non - hermitian _ orthogonal polynomials , subject to the existence of a certain curve with the s - property in an external field - the _ s - curve _ , see section [ section_s_property ] below for a precise definition .",
    "very recently , rakhmanov returned to the question of existence of s - curves from a general perspective @xcite .",
    "he considered an associated _ max - min equilibrium problem _ in logarithmic potential theory , and in an `` ideal '' situation he proved that this max - min problem has a solution and the solution has the s - property .",
    "this general approach by rakhmanov is very similar in spirit to his previous work with kamvissis @xcite , where a max - min problem for green energy in a particular external field was considered .    in @xcite ,",
    "rakhmanov also pointed out some examples where his proposed `` ideal '' situation does not apply , although similar considerations should also lead to the existence of a curve with the s - property .",
    "the present work is aimed at studying this problem in a very particular , but important , model , namely when the external field is given by the real part of a polynomial .    following the approach of rakhmanov , for a polynomial @xmath1 we consider a max - min problem of the form @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over a suitable class of contours @xmath5 ( see section [ section_admissible_contours ] below for precise definitions ) , and the infimum is taken over the set of borel probability measures",
    "@xmath6 on @xmath5 .",
    "the aim of this work is to prove that the max - min problem has a solution , and this solution leads to an s - curve @xmath5 .    the max - min approach is not the only possible approach to the existence of the s - curve . in some particular cases",
    ", it is possible to construct the s - curve explicitly from specific properties of the problem at hand , see e.g. @xcite for recent contributions . in general ,",
    "the explicit determination of the s - curve - or more specifically the determination of the support of its equilibrium measure - is a hard problem , and some numerical studies have also been carried out , see @xcite .    motivated by questions in random matrix theory",
    ", bertola @xcite also studied the existence of the s - curve for polynomial external field in the same framework as the present paper . by using deformation techniques",
    ", bertola was able to show the existence of the s - curve .",
    "however , his approach just works when the underlying equilibrium measure vanishes as a square root on the endpoints of its support , although it is very likely that his approach could also be adapted to remove this restriction .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in our work there is no restriction on the underlying equilibrium measure - so we get the same result as bertola but valid in the general situation .",
    "an extension of the concept of s - curves to vector equilibrium problems appears in the context of hermite - pad approximation , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "vector equilibrium problems also appear in certain problems in random matrix theory , for example for random matrix models with external source @xcite and coupled random matrices @xcite , see @xcite for an overview .",
    "the asymptotic analysis has been mostly restricted to cases with enough symmetry so that the relevant contours are contained in the real or imaginary axis . a suitable existence theory for curves with s - property appropriate to vector equilibrium problems with external fields , and possibly also upper constraints ,",
    "would be a major step towards the analysis of situations with less symmetry .",
    "see @xcite for a first example in this direction .",
    "to state our main result , we first need to introduce a few notations and notions .    throughout this paper , @xmath1 always denotes a complex polynomial of degree @xmath7 and @xmath8 also , we denote @xmath9      given a finite borel measure @xmath6 on @xmath10 , its _ logarithmic potential _ at @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 and its _ logarithmic energy _ by @xmath13 whenever these integrals make sense .",

    "if we modify the contour away from the support , keeping the equilibrium measure in the external field the same for the modified contour , the s - property is preserved .",
