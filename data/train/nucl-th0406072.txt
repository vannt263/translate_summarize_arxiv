    "the production of strange particles has always been a subject of great interest in heavy - ion collisions because of their relevance to possible signatures of deconfinement and flavor equilibration @xcite .",
    "strangeness enhancement that has been observed at various colliding energies is a phenomenon associated with soft particles in the bulk matter @xcite . at high transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) , on the other hand , the production of jets does not favor strange particles , whose fragmentation functions are suppressed compared to those for non - strange particles . at intermediate range between the two extremes the distribution depends sensitively on both the strangeness content and the production mechanism .",
    "it has been shown that in that range the spectra of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 can be well described by parton recombination @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the production of and @xmath2 , both of which consist of only strange quarks . without the participation of the non - strange quarks , they present a clean platform for the examination of the transverse momentum spectra of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 quarks .",
    "our aim is to learn about the transition from the enhanced thermal quarks to the suppressed shower quarks in the strange sector .    since the hidden - strange particles ( @xmath10 )",
    "are expected to have small hadronic cross sections due to the ozi rule @xcite , and are less likely to be affected by final - state interaction with co - movers in heavy - ion collisions , compared to kaons and hyperons .",
    "their spectra should therefore reveal more directly their formation mechanism .",
    "we shall apply the recombination model , as in @xcite , and predict the shapes of their spectra beyond the intermediate range where data do not yet exist .",
    "we can also calculate the @xmath11 ratio and show how different it is from the @xmath12 ratio that has been the definitive signature of parton @xcite .",
    "if the prediction of the peaking of the @xmath11 ratio at @xmath4 gev / c is verified by experiments , it will be another piece of evidence in support of at high @xmath6 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the focus of our work is on the hadronization of partons and not on the hydrodynamical evolution of the initial dense system .",
    "thus we make no assertions on the nature of the thermal partons , but take their spectra from low - data phenomenologically in the framework of the model .",
    "the shower parton distributions are known from previous study @xcite , so our calculation of the hidden - strange hadronic spectra involves the of various combinations of thermal and shower strange quarks .",
    "the enhanced thermal @xmath0 and the suppressed shower @xmath0 lead to an interesting departure from the more familiar scenario in the non - strange sector .",
    "we shall assume that all hadrons produced in heavy - ion collisions are formed by of quarks and/or antiquarks , the original formulation of which is given in @xcite .",
    "later improvements are described in @xcite for hadronic collisions , in @xcite for @xmath13 collisions and in @xcite for @xmath14 collisions . for any colliding system",
    "the invariant inclusive distribution of a produced meson with momentum @xmath8 in a 1d description of the process is @xmath15 and for a produced baryon @xmath16 the properties of the medium created by the collisions are imbedded in the joint quark distributions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the functions ( rf ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the hadron structure of the particle produced , but not on the medium out of which quarks hadronize . in the valon model description of hadron structure @xcite , the rfs are @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are statistical factors . @xmath25 abd @xmath26 are the non - invariant probability densities of finding the valons with momentum fractions @xmath27 in a meson and a baryon , respectively .    equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) apply for the produced hadron having any momentum @xmath28 .",
    "we consider @xmath28 only in the transverse plane , and write @xmath6 as @xmath8 so that @xmath29 becomes @xmath30 times the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) . for and production , @xmath17 is @xmath31 , and @xmath18 is @xmath32 .",
    "the rfs are very narrow in momentum space , since both and are loosely bound systems of the constituent @xmath0 quark .",
    "we shall approximate @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35-functions : @xmath36 and set @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . using these in eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , and then in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain the simple algebraic expressions @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the mass of or @xmath2 , as the case may be .    in @xcite",
    "we have described how the joint parton distributions can receive contributions from the thermal ( @xmath44 ) and shower ( @xmath45 ) sources . in a schematic way they can be expressed as @xmath46 where showers from more than 1 jet are neglected . in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) the multiplicative factor @xmath47 is added to the @xmath48 distribution to allow for the possible constraint arising from the competition among various channels of hadronization that can limit the number of @xmath0 quarks available for the formation of @xmath2 .    we parameterize the invariant @xmath0 quark in the thermal source as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two parameters to be determined by fitting the low - data ; they are expected to be different from those in the non - strange sector .",
    "the distribution of shower @xmath0 quark in central au+au collisions is , as in @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the shower parton distribution ( spd ) for an @xmath0 quark in a shower initiated by a hard parton @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the transverse - momentum ( @xmath56 ) of hard parton @xmath54 at midrapidity in central au+au collisions , and @xmath57 is the average fraction of hard partons that can emerge from the dense medium to hadronize . as in @xcite , @xmath55 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 is set at 3 gev / c , and @xmath57 is found to be 0.07 .",
    "equations ( [ 7])-([12 ] ) completely specify the problem .",
    "there are 3 parameters to vary to fit the spectra of and @xmath2 : they are @xmath59 and @xmath47 .",
    "all aspects of the semi - hard shower partons have been fixed by previous studies @xcite .",
    "the three parameters are all related to the soft thermal partons , the properties of which , we have stated from the outset , are to be determined phenomenologically .",
    "we first vary @xmath50 and @xmath51 to fit the data on the of in central au+au collisions at @xmath60 gev @xcite . for up to 3 gev / c , which is the extent to which data exist",
    ", the entire can be accounted for by the of the thermal partons only .",
    "the thermal - thermal component is shown by the dashed line in fig .  1",
    ". the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 used for the fit are @xmath61 the contributions from thermal - shower ( dash - dot line ) and shower - shower ( line with crosses ) do not become important until @xmath62 gev / c . the solid line in fig .",
    "1 indicates the sum of all contributions .",
    "the dominance of the thermal component for @xmath1 gev / c is due to the fact that the production of @xmath0 quarks in a shower is highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "for that reason the role of the shower partons in the formation of in the intermediate region is insignificant compared to that for the production of pions @xcite .",
    "shower - shower recombination that can be related to fragmentation can become important , but not until @xmath63 gev / c .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    next , for the production of there is only one parameter @xmath47 to vary .",
    "again , the of thermal partons only dominates throughout the whole region shown in fig",
    ".  2 . all other contributions that involve the participation of at least one shower parton are increasingly negligible with increasing number of shower @xmath0 quark .",
    "the of @xmath66 can be identified with the fragmentation of hard partons to in the same sense that the of only the shower @xmath67 in a jet gives the proton by fragmentation @xcite , even though the fragmentation function for does not exist . evidently , the contribution to the spectrum from fragmentation is negligible until is extremely large .",
    "( dashed line ) ; @xmath68 ( dash - dot line ) ; @xmath69 ( light solid line ) ; @xmath66 ( line with crosses).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the value of @xmath47 used in the fit of the data @xcite is @xmath70 it affects only the overall normalization of the spectrum , not the relative magnitudes of the different components . thus our predictive power is in the shape of spectrum , not in the normalization .",
    "the agreement with the data in fig .",
    "2 is clearly excellent .",
    "apart from the different powers of @xmath71 in eq.([11 ] ) that appear in ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , the shape is controlled by @xmath51 , which is common for both and production .",
    "the low level of production is a phenomenological fact that is embodied in the smallness of @xmath47 in eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "the underlying physics is most likely the demand for @xmath0 quarks in the formation of lower - mass particles , such as kaons , hyperons and meson , so that their availability for forming the higher - mass is significantly reduced . to consider all channels of hadronization",
    "simultaneously would require a study similar to those carried out in @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this work , where our emphasis is on the dependences of and @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the result from thermal contributions only , while the solid line includes the contributions from the shower @xmath0 quarks.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    having obtained and spectra , let us present their ratio @xmath72 , shown in fig .",
    "the dashed line is the ratio of only the thermal contributions .",
    "it is linearly rising because , on account of eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , it is proportional to @xmath8 at large @xmath8 after the common exponential terms of the two spectra are cancelled .",
    "the solid line shows the effect when the thermal - shower is taken into account .",
    "although the effect of shower partons on is small , the effect on above @xmath73 gev / c is substantial enough to turn the dashed line in fig .  3 into a peak at around 6 gev / c .",
    "confirmation of this peak by future experimental data would be a definitive validation of the theoretical approach taken here and , in particular , the importance of thermal - shower recombination .",
    "the strange sector differs from the non - strange sector in several ways .",
    "firstly , the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 given in eq.([13 ] ) are different from @xmath74 for the non - strange quarks @xcite .",
    "strangeness enhancement refers to the excess of @xmath0 quarks in @xmath14 collisions compared to the scaled @xmath75 collisions , but the total number of @xmath0 quarks is still much less than that of light quarks in nuclear collisions .",
    "that difference is reflected in @xmath50 being much less than @xmath76 .",
    "the inverse slope @xmath51 is , however , higher than @xmath77 , since hydrodynamical flow gives the more massive @xmath0 quark a larger mean transverse momentum than it does the light quarks . the combined effect of larger @xmath51 and weaker shower @xmath0 quarks results in the thermal partons becoming a dominant contributor to the formation of and over a much wider range of than in the case of non - strange quarks . for pion production",
    "the thermal - shower becomes important for @xmath78 gev / c , whereas for it is not until @xmath79 gev / c .",
    "the above comment can not be checked directly by experiments .",
    "however , the predicted ratio of to can be tested .",
    "the rising portion of that ratio in fig .",
    "3 is much broader than that for the @xmath12 ratio @xcite , and is an indication of the dominance of thermal - thermal recombination .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath80 is very different from that of @xmath81 . the latter peaks at @xmath82 gev / c with an experimental value exceeding 1 , whereas the former is predicted to peak at @xmath4 gev / c with a value less than 0.4 .",
    "neither @xmath81 nor @xmath80 exhibits properties that can be associated with fragmentation .",
    "the difference between them reflects the differences between @xmath83 and @xmath0 quarks on the one hand , and between non - strange and hidden - strange hadrons on the other .    within",
    "the framework of it is possible for us to examine the reality of formation through @xmath5 coalescence , which is a mechanism that has been advocated in certain models @xcite .",
    "if @xmath84 denotes the invariant inclusive distribution , @xmath85 , of hadron @xmath86 at @xmath87 in heavy - ion collisions , then the coalescence process of @xmath88 implies by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) that @xmath89}(p_t ) \\propto h_k^2(p_t/2 )    \\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from a multiplicative constant associated with the rf . on the other hand ,",
    "if is produced by @xmath90 as we have done here , then the same procedure yields @xmath91}(p_t ) \\propto { \\cal t}_s^2(p_t/2 ) ,    \\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dominance of the thermal parton is used .",
    "thus it is a matter of comparing @xmath92 with @xmath93 , which are the invariant distributions of the entities that recombine .",
    "since a kaon is formed by @xmath94 recombination , where @xmath95 denotes either @xmath96 or @xmath97 , whose thermal @xmath98 is characterized by @xmath76 and @xmath77 shown in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , the exponential part of @xmath92 must have an inverse slope @xmath99 that is between @xmath77 and @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "that is to be compared to the exponential part of @xmath102 , which is @xmath103 [ cf .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) ] . in view of our good fit of the data in fig .  1",
    ", we conclude that an alternative fit using @xmath92 characterized by @xmath99 would fail .",
    "it therefore follows from the consideration of the dependence alone that can not be formed by @xmath5 coalescence .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with that of @xcite based on the centrality independence of the @xmath104 ratio .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that both and are formed mainly by the of thermal @xmath0 quarks , have reproduced the shape of the of from a fit of that of @xmath3 , and have made a prediction of the ratio of to that peaks at @xmath4 gev / c .",
    "thermal - shower does not become important until is at around that peak , and parton fragmentation does not dominate until @xmath6 is much higher .",
    "finally , we have shown how the dependence disfavors the formation of by @xmath5 coalescence .",
