    "the binary grs  1915 + 105 is a member of the group called microquasars .",
    "it is a stellar size analogue of quasars , containing an accreting black hole and ejecting two jets at relativistic speeds ( mirabel & rodriguez 1998 ) .",
    "a number of groups have attempted to find the basic properties of the system : morgan , remillard & greiner ( 1997 ) and greiner , morgan & remillard ( 1998 ) used the rxte data to constrain the mass of the black hole ( bh ) and inferred the limits between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "recently greiner , cuby , & mccaughrean ( 2001 ) used the infrared observations to obtain the mass function .",
    "they were also able to identify and characterize the donor .",
    "they find that the system consists of a @xmath2 bh , with a @xmath3 k - m iii type giant filling its roche lobe , at an orbital separation of @xmath4 ( period of 33.5 days ) .",
    "the formation of such system poses a problem for the standard stellar evolutionary scenarios ( greiner et al .",
    "the mass of the bh is larger than the bh masses measured so far . in the framework of stellar evolution",
    "it was argued ( wellstein & langer 1999 ) that massive stars are not able to produce such massive bhs .",
    "the high wind mass loss rates ( or the mass transfer event ) remove entire h - rich envelopes of massive stars , which become massive wolf - rayet stars with yet more enhanced mass loss rates .",
    "therefore , at the time of core collapse / sn explosion these massive stars are reduced to a fraction of their initial mass , and they can not be responsible for formation of massive bhs . in order to avoid this problem , it was suggested that wind mass loss rates were overestimated ( e.g. nugis & lamers 2000 ) .",
    "it was also proposed that probably the mass transfer ( mt ) phase reveling bare helium core happens very late in the evolution of a star ( case c mt ) , and thus remaining lifetime of wolf - rayet phase is very short and wind mass loss is not that significant ( brown , lee & tauris 2001 ; kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "however , nelemans & van den heuvel ( 2001 ) performed calculations with reduced helium mass loss rates and allowed for case c mt scenario , and they have found that they are still not able to reproduce the formation of high mass bhs .",
    "this was due to the fact , that the case c mt is attainable only for primaries initially less massive than 19 - 25 @xmath5 , and thus not able to form high mass bhs .",
    "nelemans & van den heuvel ( 2001 ) suggested that helium stars end their lives with higher masses than it is currently believed ( i.e. , either their lifetimes are shorter or the mass loss rates should be further reduced ) .",
    "recent development of population synthesis codes may offer a solution for formation of high mass bhs in binaries .",
    "belczynski , kalogera & bulik ( 2002 , hereinafter bkb02 ) have shown that using detailed hydrodynamical calculation of core collapse ( fryer 1999 ) and allowing for a direct bh formation there is a possibility of forming bhs of @xmath6 for a wide range of initial stellar masses .",
    "they have also demonstrated that reduction of lowered helium star wind mass loss rates by another factor of 2 ( which is still allowed by the observations ) may increase maximum bh mass formed out of a single star up to @xmath7 , while reduction of all wind mass loss rates ( both for h - rich and he - rich stellar phases ) increases the maximum bh mass to @xmath8 .",
    "belczynski , bulik , kluzniak ( 2002 ) have calculated that the mass of bh may be maximally increased during binary interactions by @xmath9 .",
    "the highest mass bhs appear because of mt in a binary , yet this is not likely in case of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the bh of grs  1915 + 105 is in a binary with a low mass star , and therefore bh mass could not have been increased significantly",
    ". currently the mass ratio of the system components is @xmath10 .",
    "however , the progenitor of the bh must have been even more massive and the initial mass ratio must have been even smaller , @xmath11 .",
    "to appear at the present orbital separation the system must have gone through a common envelope ( ce ) stage .",
    "it is not clear when the ce event took place and what type of mt ( case b , c ) was involved ( brown , lee , & tauris  2001 , nelemans & van den heuvel 2001 )    in this paper we present the investigation of the possible evolutionary paths leading to the presently observed parameters of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "we use the _ startrack _ population synthesis code ( bkb02 ) to search for possible evolutionary paths that may lead to formation of such a binary .",
    "we describe the model and present the results in   2 , while   3 contains the discussion and summary .",
    "in our calculations we use the _ startrack _ population synthesis code described in detail in bkb02 . in our standard evolutionary scenario , we use modified hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) formulae to evolve single stars along with their proposed wind mass loss rates . different types of binary interactions are taken into account , and in particular we follow the evolution of dynamically stable and unstable mt phases . to model dynamically stable events we follow prescription proposed by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and for unstable phases we invoke standard ce prescription of webbink ( 1984 ) .",
    "we form compact objects in supernova ( sn ) explosion / core collapse events , following the results of hydrodynamical calculations of fryer ( 1999 ) .",
    "neutron stars are formed in full flagged sn explosions and receive natal kicks form the cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) distribution ; intermediate mass bhs are formed through partial fall back and in attenuated sn explosions receiving smaller kicks than neutron stars ( nss ) ; while most massive bhs are formed through direct collapse of immediate progenitor with no accompanying sn explosion and they do not received any kicks at their formation .",
    "we start by examining the properties of the binaries resembling the current state of grs  1915 + 105 , i.e. containing a bh accreting from a low mass giant . in order to trace the evolution of grs  1915 + 105 like system in more detail we require that , under the assumption of conservative mt orbit evolution , the period of the binary will at some point reach the current value of @xmath12days , and that then the bh mass is @xmath13 , and the red giant with mass of @xmath14 . as during conservative mt from lower mass object period increases",
    ", this leaves only systems with periods shorter than the observed one as possible progenitors of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the systems could have gone through two mt episodes : first when the more massive star ( currently the bh ) was evolving , and we are witnessing the second one now .    under the assumption that the second mt phase began already when the donor was a red giant , we calculate the maximum mass loss rate from giant donor in binary with a massive bh . maximum mass loss increases with the lifetime of a giant ( shorter for higher masses ) and with core mass of a giant at the onset of mt ( bigger for higher masses ) .",
    "using formulae presented by ritter ( 1999 ) and stellar models implemented in _",
    "startrack _ we find that only red giants with masses @xmath15 have a chance to become less massive than @xmath16 .",
    "a @xmath17 star may lose only @xmath18 during its red giant lifetime ( @xmath19 myrs ) , while @xmath20 star ( @xmath21 myrs ) may lose up to @xmath22 to a @xmath23 bh companion . under the above assumptions , we obtain @xmath24 upper limit on the mass of secondary in grs  1915 + 105 , which suggests that only a small amount of mass was transferred in the system , and that the observed bh mass is close to the one , at which the bh was formed .",
    "there is also a possibility , that the current mt onto bh began when the secondary was still unevolved , i.e. on the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "however the chances of such configuration are much smaller than for a giant donor .",
    "the reason is that low - mass ms stars expand only slightly ( factors of a few ) and to form a bh system with ms roche lobe overflowing donor would require that it starts from the orbital periods in a very narrow range . on the other hand , for red giants the radius expansion is significantly larger ( factors of tens to several tens ) , so the systems from much wider range of orbital periods may lead to roche lobe overflow .",
    "moreover , if the mt began when the secondary was still on ms , it is not clear that such a system would survive the evolution through the secondary rapid expansion across the hertzsprung gap and later form mt system with a giant donor , resembling the one observed in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "thus in our simulations we are looking for systems with the orbital period shorter than @xmath12days , with a bh more massive than @xmath25 and a giant with the mass lower then @xmath26 and effective temperature in the range of @xmath27@xmath28k corresponding to spectral type range : k4k0 .",
    "we evolved binaries with the massive primaries ( @xmath29 ) , and the low - mass secondaries ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we first ran a standard model simulation ( see bkb02 ) with @xmath31 binaries and obtained no systems satisfying the above defined criteria . for such low initial mass ratios the masses of the bhs in binaries barely reach up to @xmath25 .",
    "we then ran a set of simulations with modified binary evolution parameters : a model with all stellar winds decreased by two ( model g1 of bkb02 ) , a model with increased ce efficiency @xmath32 ( model e4 ) , and a model where bh receive the same magnitude kicks as the nss do ( model s1 ) , and a model in which bh receive no kicks at birth regardless of their mass ( model s2 ) .",
    "only one model ( model g1 ) was successful , and we obtained @xmath33 grs  1915 + 105 like systems after evolving @xmath31 primordial binaries .",
    "in most of the cases shown the progenitor system evolves through a ce phase , when the primary expands during its evolution on the giant branch .",
    "this tightens the orbit to periods resembling the one observed today . however , although infrequently , the system may start from a much wider orbit , and thus avoid a ce phase ( the primary never expands enough to fill its roche lobe ) . then at the time of the bh formation a correctly placed natal kick puts the bh in a tight orbit with its companion , and that was how several systems obtained a period resembling the one observed today in grs  1915 + 105 . with the proper period and bh in place , the system then just awaits till the low - mass secondary evolves off the ms and becomes a red giant .",
    "expansion along the red giant branch eventually brings the secondary to fill its roche lobe , and the second mt episode starts . during this phase",
    "the mass is transferred conservatively from the secondary to the bh , causing the increase of orbital period .",
    "somewhere along this phase , which may last hundreds of myrs for low - mass giants , the system resembles the currently observed state of grs  1915 + 105 .      in figure  [ mqevol ]",
    "we show an example of binary evolution leading to formation of grs  1915 + 105 . in order to reproduce the high bh mass",
    "we were forced to decrease all mass loss rates used in our standard model by a factor of two .",
    "we start the evolution with two population i ( z=0.02 ) zero age main sequence ( zams ) stars , a @xmath34  primary and a @xmath35  secondary , in a wide ( semi - major axis @xmath36 ) and eccentric orbit ( eccentricity @xmath37 ) . in",
    "about @xmath38myrs the primary evolves off the ms and becomes a giant , increasing its size significantly .",
    "when the radius of the primary becomes comparable to the periastron distance tidal circularization becomes efficient and the orbit circularizes .",
    "we treat circularization with the conservation of binary angular momentum , and thus @xmath39 decreases . after further expansion",
    "the primary fills its roche lobe , and although it has lost almost 17 @xmath5  in the wind , it is still much more massive than its low - mass ms companion . due to the extreme mass ratio ,",
    "the following mt is dynamically unstable and leads to ce phase ( stage ii ) .",
    "the envelope of the primary is ejected from the system at the cost of the binary orbital energy , and the binary orbit shrinks by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "since the ce phase was very short ( evolution on dynamical timescale ) the secondary is almost unaffected , however the primary after the loss of its entire envelope becomes a massive helium star ( stage iii ) .",
    "the helium star primary evolves through consecutive nuclear burning phases , loosing @xmath40  in the heavy wolf - rayet star type wind ( slight expansion of the orbit , stage iv ) , until it finally collapses to form a bh .",
    "the immediate bh progenitor is a helium star , which due to its high mass implodes directly to form a bh without any associated sn explosion .",
    "there is neither mass loss nor orbital parameter ( a , e ) change ( stage v ) .",
    "a small mass ( stellar binding energy ) loss in this phase would introduce a small eccentricity which will not affect significantly the further evolution of the system .",
    "the binary now harboring the massive bh and the low - mass ms secondary remains unchanged on a circular @xmath41day orbit for over 5 gyrs , the time needed for the secondary to evolve off the ms .",
    "the secondary on its way up the red giant branch fills its roche lobe , and the second mt begins ( stage vi ) .",
    "the donor is much less massive than the bh companion and the mt is dynamically stable , proceeding on nuclear timescale of expansion of the secondary .",
    "the conservative mt rate may be approximated with a simple analytical formulae ( e.g. ritter 1999 ) .",
    "vilhu ( 2002 ) estimated the current mt rate for grs  1915 + 105 to be @xmath42 . since the predicted mt rate may be overestimated due to x - ray heating of the donor ( vilhu 2002 ) we use @xmath43 to evolve the system through the mt phase .",
    "starting from the initial period of @xmath44 the mt continues through 10.5 myrs until the orbit expands to match the observed period of grs 1915 + 105 of @xmath45 ( stage vii ) .",
    "we have assumed that all the material transferred from the donor ( @xmath46 ) was accreted onto bh .",
    "this assumption ( mass conservation ) does not hold exactly in case of microquasars as at least a fraction of the transferred material must be lost in the jets .",
    "had we assumed non - conservative evolution during mt , we would have obtained a similar result , although we would expect the mt to last diffrent period of time ( depending on the specific angular momentum of ejecta ) in order for the binary to reach the observed period of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "we have modeled the evolutionary paths leading to formation of binaries with a massive bh accreting from a low mass giant using the _ startrack _ population synthesis code .",
    "the initial binary separations span a wide range however the initial periastron distance @xmath47 is constrained in the range between @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see figure  [ initial ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we require the period of the system to become smaller than the one observed today in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "wider systems either have too long resulting periods or never enter a ce phase . the tighter systems begin the first mt just when they leave the ms and their cores are not massive enough to produce later the observed high mass bh .",
    "the distribution of the initial masses of the primary , shown in figure  [ initial ] , is quite wide .",
    "it starts rising steeply above @xmath50 , where direct bh formation starts ( for lowered wind mass loss rates ; see fig.1 in bkb02 ) .",
    "it means that _",
    "i ) _ masses of bh are high and that _ ii ) _ bh do not receive natal kicks , which would easily disrupt many potential progenitors .",
    "the distribution peaks at around @xmath51 and then declines roughly as dictated by combination of our assumed initial mass function and the initial - final mass relation . in the model g1 where potential grs  1915 + 105 progenitors appear , we find that even stars with @xmath52 may overfill their roche lobe and initiate mt .",
    "such massive stars are believed to lose mass at the rate sufficiently high that in response the orbit expands faster than the star increase its size , hence mt is not expected .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that in our model we have decreased wind mass loss rates , and therefore the orbital expansion is much slower .",
    "most of the secondary masses lie between @xmath53 , implying that only small amount of material has been accreted onto bh .",
    "we find that the large mass of the bh can be easily explained provided that the wind mass loss rates are decreased by a factor of two .",
    "the wind mass loss rates in massive stars have been discussed by nelemans & van den heuvel ( 2001 ) . in their figure 2",
    "describing the mass loss rates for wolf - rayet stars there is quite a significant scatter in the observational points , and the only point for an @xmath54 star lies a factor of a few below all lines corresponding to different approximations used in the literature .",
    "thus we conjecture that the mass loss rates for massive wolf - rayet stars above @xmath55 could be approximately a factor of two lower than it would seem based on the extrapolation of the results for lower mass stars .",
    "we note that the first mt ( ce phase ) from the massive primary to the low mass secondary proceeds in most cases not by the clear case b or case c evolution . this fact was already noted in the literature ( e.g. dewi et al . 2002 ) , however it is still not widely acknowledged",
    ". massive stars ( @xmath56 ) begin core helium burning ( cheb ) shortly after leaving ms , and in most cases they avoid an extended phase of h - shell burning ( first giant branch ) . on the h - r diagram these stars move to the up and right , increasing monotonically their temperature and luminosity . in contrast to intermediate and low - mass stars , their radii increase during the cheb phase . as",
    "the cheb phase is relatively long - lived , many of these stars overfill their roche lobes if harbored in close binaries , driving a mt during cheb .",
    "standard mt terminology devised for low - mass and intermediate mass stars , which contract during cheb , and thus can not drive mt during this phase , is therefore not applicable for very massive stars . to avoid the confusion , we denote here the mt driven by the star during its cheb as late case b mt .",
    "formation of the most massive bh in close binary systems needs to be connected with this late case b evolution , as this is the stage when the star has the biggest core when it is stripped of its envelope .",
    "additionally , one may form a massive bh in close binaries from initially very wide systems , which avoided mt but then during the bh formation a precisely placed natal kick may tighten the binary . however , the possibility of such an event is very small , and moreover it is not yet clear if most massive bhs receive any kicks at all . in fact ,",
    "nelemans , tauris & van den heuvel ( 1999 ) found that spatial velocities of binaries harboring bh , are easily explained by the symmetrical sn mass ejection and without any significant natal kick accompanying bh formation .",
    "we consider the low spatial velocity of grs  1915 + 105 ( @xmath57  km s@xmath58 ) , as the first observational evidence that the most massive bh are formed without any kicks imparted on the system , and thus no accompanying mass ejection nor sn explosion .",
    "this is just a reasonable extrapolation of the findings of nelemans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which is consistent with theoretical modeling of sn / core collapse events by fryer ( 1999 ) ; ns are formed in asymmetric sn explosions , while intermediate massive bh are formed through partial fall back accompanied by almost symmetric sn and receive either a small or no kick at all , while the most massive bh are formed in direct collapse with no sn nor natal kick .",
    "we conclude that existence of a massive bh in grs  1915 + 105 implies that the currently used wind mass loss rates , both for h- and he - rich stars , are possibly overestimated by factor of @xmath59 for very massive stars . moreover , our models reproduce the observed properties of grs  1915 + 105 , only if we allow for direct bh formation , with no accompanying sn explosion .",
    "our results also suggest that the directly formed bh do not receive any natal kicks .",
    "if we agree on the possibility of the direct collapse of a massive star at the end of its nuclear lifetime , and also if we allow for change of wind mass loss rates within observational bounds , we find that evolution and formation of grs  1915 + 105 can be well understood within the current framework of stellar single and binary evolution .",
    "we would like to thank michal rozyczka , ron taam , vicky kalogera , ron webbink , natasha ivanova , janusz ziokowski and fred rasio for comments on this project .",
