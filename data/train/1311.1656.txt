    "it is obvious to see from definition that the mutual information vanishes if two emissions are independent . a simple evaluation yields @xmath9 for the tunneling model@xcite . using this definition of mutual information , we show in the figure [ fig : vonneumann ] that by considering pairwise entanglement between schwarzschild black hole and emitted particles",
    "it is entertaining to compare with an earlier unitary model of black hole evaporation proposed by page@xcite and recently by iizuka and kabat@xcite .",
    "consider a black hole @xmath0 evaporates in @xmath10 steps with a particle of equal mass @xmath1 each time . the mutual information between the black hole and emitted particles ( solid curve ) first increases then decreases , while total mutual information between pairs of emitted particles ( dashed curve ) increases quadratically .",
    "here we use @xmath11 to simulate the result.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fact , the tunneling probability takes a universal form for many kinds of black hole with finite size of event horizon : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the change of bekenstein - hwaking entropy after radiation .",
    "in particular , the tunneling model of neutral particles in the reissner - norstrm black hole was discussed in parikh and wilczek s original work@xcite and it was generalized to charged particles later in @xcite . in the case of the reissner - norstrm black holes with mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath14 , we denote the entropy function as @xmath15 ^ 2-\\big(m+\\sqrt{m^2-q^2 } \\big)^2\\}$ ] for each emission of mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath16 . in order to avoid naked singularity ,",
    "condition @xmath17 has to be satisfied during the hawking radiation .",
    "this suggests the existence of certain bound(s ) for charge - mass ratio in each emission . in the original treatment of hawking radiation , it is not obvious how to estimate this ratio bound while the conservation of energy is not enforced . on the other hand ,",
    "while the conservation law is enforced in the tunneling model , the conservation of information is also guaranteed@xcite . whether the information loss paradox is solved or not in the tunneling model by admitting nontrivial entanglement during the radiation process is still under dedate@xcite .",
    "regardless the consequence of debate , our main results in this letter are to estimate the charge - mass ratio bound from the mutual information shared by two consecutive emissions , and propose an optimization scheme in the radiation process .",
    "since the monotonically decreasing of black hole entropy during hawking radiation , it is a natural assumption that mutual information stored in each consecutive emission pair is nonnegative .",
    "this fact is known as the jensen s inequality from the mathematical point of view . ] .",
    "the nonnegativity condition for the mutual information in radiation of schwarzschild black holes simply requires that @xmath18 in each emission , which is just the nonnegativity of mass or energy defined earlier is a monotanously decreasing function with respect to @xmath0 , that is @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , the nonnegativity condition is not automatically satisfied in the case of rn black hole because the @xmath20 is not a simple function when both @xmath0 and @xmath14 are varying . ] .",
    "investigating the mutual information appeared in the reissner - norstrm black hole suggests a bound for charge - mass ratio .",
    "the mutual information between two consecutive emissions with mass @xmath21 and charge @xmath22 can be computed as @xmath23 .",
    "while this quantity is nontrivially dependent on @xmath0 and @xmath14 , it is insightful to obtain some simple results at following limits :    * @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 + in the limit of large black mass and charge , we have a simple form : @xmath27 .",
    "if one assumes that two emissions are identical for simplicity , the nonnegativity condition enforces an upper bound for the charge - mass ratio @xmath28 . * @xmath29 + in this near extremal and large mass(charge ) limit , one finds the nonnegativity condition gives a small window for possible charge - mass ratio , that is @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",

    "the color contours show the equi - height lines of mutual information with values between @xmath36 and @xmath39.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    apart from those above - mentioned limits , one can numerically show the existence of bound(s ) is universal for various values of black hole mass and charge .",
    "as shown in the figure [ fig : ratio_bound ] , the upper bound is between @xmath40 and @xmath37 and there also appears nonzero lower bound near extremal limit while @xmath41 .",
    "we have learnt that the emitted quanta have bounds for the charge - mass ratio , but it does not tell exactly how much information is carried away during each emission . to estimate the amount of information for each emission",
    ", we propose the following alternative mechanism for evaporation of a charged black hole :    * given a specific mass and charge of a charged black hole , emissions of nonnegative mutual information are all admitted with some probability . * the emission carrying more mutual information has more chance .",
    "that is , the emission with maximum mutual information ( mmi ) dominates the process .",
    "it is possible to realize above - mentioned mechanism in the language of path integral , if an action relevant to the mutual information could be assigned to different paths . from information point of view , this is an optimization process that a charged black hole radiates most efficiently by giving away as much information as possible .",
    "the optimized @xmath35 ratio of emission with mmi can be estimated by assuming two consecutive emissions are small . in the figure [ fig : ratio_bound ] and [ fig : loci ]",
    ", we plot the function @xmath42 and loci of mmi for various @xmath38 ratio and emitted @xmath35 ratio .",
    "several remarks are in order :    * the mutual information , carried away by pair of emissions with mass @xmath1 , has maximum value @xmath43 for the neutral schwarzschild black hole . * for the charged black hole ,",
    "the mutual information decreases with the @xmath38 ratio .",
    "that is , the closer to the extremal limit , the less information _ leaks _ via radiation .",
    "the process is expected to stop at the extremal limit due to vanishing mutual information .",
    "however , it might take infinite time ( steps ) to reach extremal limit from non - extremality as discussed in @xcite . *",
    "the charge - mass ratio of mmi , denoting @xmath44 , is given by @xmath45 which is very small while the charged black hole is far away from extremal limit , and approaches unity while it is near extremality .",
    "evaporation under the mmi optimization .",
    "the process starts with some initial ratio @xmath46 and leads to the final state @xmath47 , where a black hole vanishes at zero temperature.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the contour plot of @xmath48 .",
    "the absolute value @xmath49 grows with black hole mass and get larger far away from extremality.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the evaporation of charged black holes were studied in detail by hiscock and weems@xcite , where the radiation spectrum is thermal and schwinger formula for pair - production were used for charge dissipation .",
    "the evaporation process respecting the mmi optimization can be simulated for charged black holes with various initial masses @xmath0 and charges @xmath14 . as shown in the figure [ fig : evaporate ] , it seems to roughly agree with the mass dissipation zone in @xcite at the early stage , however at later stage , it leads to the extremal limit before mass is completely exhausted , while it leads farther away from extremality in hiscock and weems .",
    "there appears no charge dissipation zone in our model .",
    "these differences can be also understood by explicitly evaluating the specific heat in our model : @xmath50 we plot the specific heat for various @xmath0 and ratio @xmath51 in the figure [ fig : specific_heat ] . in constrast to that in @xcite , the specific heat in our model is always negative , but approaching zero before it completely evaporates at extremality .",
    "we remark that to derive this specific heat , one noly needs to impose the optimization of mmi , without knowing details about charge and mass dissipation .",
    "the charge - mass ratio bound is found in this letter to be of order unity , that is about @xmath52 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that similar charge - mass ratio bound near the charged black hole was investigated by including the self - interaction of charged particles due to the infinite redshift near black hole horizon@xcite , and recently by one of the authors using the tunneling method@xcite .",
    "based on the same tunneling model , the ratio bound imposed by the nonnegativity of mutual information is tighter than that by the self - force@xcite , nevertheless both bounds approaches unity when the black hole is near the extremality . on the other hand , it would be interesting to check whether the evaporation scenario proposed in @xcite respects the nonnegativity constraint .",
    "since we have learnt that in the tunneling model , the nonnegative mutual information is in fact a direct consequence of monotoneous decreasing of black hole entropy during evaporation of both schawrzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes , it can serve as a guiding principle to rule out any model with unphysical process . furthermore ,",
    "as we show in this paper , it can even _ dictate _ the dynamics if optimization is called .",
