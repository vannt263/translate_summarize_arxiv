    "the phase transition is called `` trigger '' in this paper because the phase transition triggers the oscillation of the waterfall field @xmath8 . a crucial difference from the usual curvaton is that the source of the perturbation is not the perturbation of the oscillating ( waterfall ) field ( because @xmath9 for large scale ) but the perturbation of the slow - rolling field ( @xmath10 )  @xcite , which is not the inflaton ( @xmath11 ) of the primordial inflation but it is the field which triggers the phase transition . the characteristics of this scenario are shown in fig .",

    "as is discussed in the text , @xmath13 is determined by the model parameters . ]",
    "let us first consider the basic curvaton scenario .",
    "the initial perturbation of the curvaton @xmath8 is given by @xmath14 this corresponds to the perturbation @xmath15 in fig.[fig : usual ] .",
    "if the oscillation starts at @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( in the figure ) is exactly determined by the curvaton mass @xmath18 . then there is no perturbation which corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "obviously , both @xmath20 and @xmath19 can source the curvaton perturbation , but in the basic scenario the source perturbation is almost entirely coming from @xmath15 .",
    "the total curvature perturbation during the curvaton oscillation is given by @xmath21 where we introduced the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 is negligible . to calculate the curvaton perturbation ,",
    "what we need is the quantity @xmath24 at the beginning of the oscillation because @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 becomes constant during the ( quasi)sinusoidal oscillation .",
    "the new idea in this paper is that @xmath24 _ is dominated by the perturbation _ @xmath19 . in the basic ( non - hybrid ) scenario , the perturbation caused by @xmath26 does not dominate the total curvature perturbation .",
    "such modulated ( inhomogeneous ) interaction is not considered in this paper . ]",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the source of @xmath19 in the basic curvaton scenario is @xmath27 , and @xmath18 is not a constant when the potential is not quadratic . assuming that the sinusoidal oscillation starts at @xmath28 , the perturbation at the beginning of the oscillation is given by @xmath29 here we consider @xmath30 where , in contrast to the inflation phase , @xmath31 in the radiation dominated universe , which dominates the evolution of @xmath32 . assuming a polynomial function @xmath33",
    ", we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the quadratic potential gives @xmath36 , which always leads to @xmath37 . for @xmath38",
    ", we find @xmath39 the above perturbation is comparable to the perturbation sourced by @xmath15 in the basic curvaton scenario . therefore , this perturbation does not dominate the curvature perturbation , but may change its non - gaussianity . as the result ,",
    "the deviation from the quadratic potential ( @xmath38 ) may cause @xmath40 , but this perturbation can not dominate over the total curvature perturbation . in the original curvaton scenario ,",
    "the above dynamics has been included in the function @xmath41 introduced in ref .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite )",
    "to find a significant enhancement of the curvaton perturbation , consider a hybrid potential that is given by @xmath42 the potential during slow - roll is @xmath43 .",
    "the hybrid potential usually leads to generation of cosmic strings at the phase transition ( @xmath44 ) , but in this curvaton scenario the strings do not lead to a serious cosmological problem because the typical energy scale is much lower than the cosmological bound .",
    "suppose that the `` rolling field '' ( @xmath45 ) rolls from far away ( @xmath46 ) and the sinusoidal oscillation of the `` waterfall field '' ( @xmath8 ) starts suddenly after the phase transition . in this model , @xmath47",
    "is determined by the `` rolling field '' reaching the waterfall at @xmath48 .",

    "on the other hand , the initial value of the curvaton oscillation is given by @xmath51 , which means that the conventional source of the perturbation ( @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : usual ] ) vanishes in this model . for simplicity , assume that the energy density of the curvaton oscillation evolves as @xmath7 just after the phase transition .    in this scenario ,",
    "the perturbation of the `` rolling field '' ( @xmath10 ) is converted into @xmath19 to cause the perturbation @xmath52 . in this model ,",
    "the transfer of the perturbation @xmath53 sources the curvaton perturbation @xmath54 .",
    "the modulation of the phase transition ( @xmath55 ) causes the perturbation of the curvaton density ; @xmath56 where @xmath57 is assumed for the oscillation .",
    "if @xmath45 rolls slowly before the phase transition , there is a significant enhancement of the curvaton perturbation .",
    "note that , in the above equation , @xmath50 is not the conventional slow - roll velocity which is usually given by @xmath58 .",
    "this field has a significant acceleration @xmath59 due to @xmath60 in the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "moreover , the typical expansion given by @xmath61 shows that the relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is obviously non - linear .",
    "this kind of non - linearity does not appear in the case of the standard quasi - de sitter inflation ( with @xmath45 the inflaton ) , since @xmath64 is usually assumed for @xmath45 to undergo slow - roll .",
    "however , @xmath64 is not true in the radiation - dominated background . for later convenience , we consider the approximation ; @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the hubble parameter at the phase transition . here",
    "@xmath67 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the deviation from slow - roll is measured by @xmath68 .",
    "we assume @xmath69 to avoid extreme situations . may hold even if the field @xmath45 started oscillating near the waterfall . here",

    "it is evident that @xmath86 is motivated by supergravity , and @xmath87 measures the deviation from the naive setup .",
    "@xmath88 is inevitable if the usual supersymmetry breaking sector ( which is not related to the curvaton potential ) gives the mass term with @xmath70 .",
    "in both cases @xmath5 is highly model - dependent . ]",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath86 are possible at the same time if the universe is dominated by the radiation  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the spectrum @xmath90 for the slow - rolling field , where @xmath91 is the hubble parameter during the primordial inflation . defining the energy ratio at the beginning of the @xmath8 oscillation as @xmath92 we find at @xmath47 ; @xmath93 again",

    "although the situation depends on the choice of the model , @xmath104 may cause significant interaction between @xmath45 and the radiation , which could alter the potential . in this sense ,",
    "the potential used in the above argument is the effective potential approximated at the point very close to the waterfall and it includes all these corrections .",
    "the spectral index is @xmath105 and the non - gaussianity is @xmath106 for @xmath107 , as in the usual curvaton scenario . here",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath82 are defined at the horizon exit .      as a second example , we consider the fast decay scenario . again , we find the spectrum of the perturbation given by @xmath109 here the fast - decay assumption leads to @xmath110 . to quantify the ratio ,",
    "we introduce a parameter defined by @xmath111 where @xmath112 corresponds to the instant decay .",
    "we find @xmath113 as in the usual curvaton scenario , the phase transition at @xmath114 leads to enhanced non - gaussianity .",
    "the model predicts that , whenever @xmath115 is natural in the hybrid curvaton scenario , the instant decay may affect non - gaussianity .",
    "this is not mandatory in the slow - roll scenario , but could be mandatory if slow - roll breaks down before the waterfall .",
    "we are going to consider this possibility in the next section , although a more exact calculation requires numerical study .      since the radiation energy density is decreasing while @xmath116 is constant , the natural idea is that @xmath117 triggers the significant variation of @xmath45 and eventually it causes the phase transition . because the contribution of @xmath45 to the scalar potential is small ( i.e , @xmath118 ) ,",
    "the kinetic energy of @xmath45 is not significant even if the slow - roll is violated before the waterfall . to avoid an extreme situation ,",
    "our modest assumption in this section is @xmath119 . on the other hand , the perturbation @xmath63 leaves horizon during the primordial inflation , when the slow - roll parameters of @xmath45 are supposed to be much smaller than unity .",
    "we thus find that the spectral index is small , @xmath120 .",
    "the problem in the slow - roll scenario is that , since the variation of @xmath45 ( i.e , @xmath121 ) is negligible , we always have to assume careful tuning of the initial condition @xmath122 .",
    "this tuning is relaxed if slow - roll breaks down just before the phase transition .",
    "moreover , since @xmath123 is justified in supergravity , there is the _ important prediction _ that @xmath124 in the hybrid curvaton model .    to look into more details , consider the evolution in the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "this immediately leads to the equation of motion @xmath125 where the hubble parameter evolves as @xmath126 before fast - roll , we assume @xmath127 . substituting @xmath128 , we find for the radiation dominated universe  @xcite @xmath129 which has an oscillating solution when @xmath130 according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there can be a cancellation that leads to @xmath131 during radiation domination .",
    "therefore , a conceivable set - up of the model is @xmath132 with fast - roll starting when @xmath133 . at this moment ( @xmath134 ) , we find @xmath135    to capture the evolution after the breaking of slow - roll , we introduce @xmath136 , which is determined by the evolution thereafter .",
    "@xmath137 means that the @xmath8-oscillation starts immediately after the breaking of slow - roll .",
    "note that a non - trivial evolution of the waterfall field can be described by @xmath138 , which we will not consider",
    ". there could be a small - scale perturbation of @xmath139 , but this is not the topic of this paper .",
    "for @xmath140 , the @xmath8-oscillation starts in the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "this means that @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 assuming fast decay ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath86 , the slow - roll breakdown just before the waterfall may produce naturally the coincidence @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the scenario gives rise to @xmath144 , which can affect non - gaussianity .",
    "one may suspect that a large initial value ( @xmath145 ) can easily cause a long - time rolling that leads to the curvaton domination before the phase transition .",
    "this speculation is true . in this respect ,",
    "the scenario more or less depends on the initial condition .",
    "@xmath146 with @xmath86 may lead to the opposite scenario , in which domination by the curvaton starts _ before _ the phase transition .",
    "this scenario of the inflating curvaton  @xcite will be discussed in the next section .    in the above scenario with @xmath86 , long - time oscillation of the waterfall field",
    "is not needed for the curvaton domination .",
    "the waterfall field @xmath8 can decay after a few oscillations , _ in contrast to the standard curvaton scenario _ , in which a small decay rate is needed for the curvaton domination .",
    "the spectrum of the curvature perturbation is obtained in the same way as in the previous ( slow - roll ) scenario ; @xmath147 where the ratio @xmath148 behaves like a constant when @xmath149 is quadratic .",
    "otherwise , the result is highly model - dependent .",
    "note that the deviation from @xmath150 might be significant at the waterfall if the evolution is already far from slow - roll ( i.e , when @xmath151 ) . in this case , the non - linear evolution of @xmath45 and @xmath63 is significant and it requires further study . here , considering a model with the modest evolution @xmath150 and @xmath86 ( as motivated by supergravity ) , we expect @xmath152 .",
    "it is possible to realize the inflating curvaton scenario if the oscillation starts after curvaton domination .",
    "this scenario always gives @xmath153 by definition , and helps to explain the spectral index and its running by reducing the number of e - foldings required for the primordial inflation  @xcite .",
    "the number of e - foldings during the curvaton inflation ( @xmath154 ) is determined by the initial condition @xmath155 and @xmath5 ; @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the beginning of the curvaton inflation . in this section",
    "we assume @xmath76 couplings for the hybrid potential ( @xmath158 ) just for simplicity .",
    "considering the bound @xmath159 and @xmath160tev ( i.e , @xmath161tev ) , we find from eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) that the maximum number of @xmath154 is given by @xmath162 slow - roll ( @xmath163 ) requires @xmath164 if we demand @xmath165 .",
    "we are not excluding this possibility , but it would be interesting to relax this tuning using a fast - roll potential ( @xmath166 ) . in this case",
    "we find @xmath167 since the ratio @xmath148 does not evolve in the case of a quadratic potential , we obtain @xmath168 where the relation @xmath169 was used . here",
    "@xmath170 denotes the observable spectrum from the cmb .",
    "if we consider the stochastic initial condition @xcite , we find @xmath171 . here",
    "@xmath172 is used because @xmath76 couplings are assumed .",
    "therefore , the stochastic condition leads to @xmath173 this result is in sharp contrast to the pngb inflating curvaton  @xcite , in which the stochastic condition puts an _ upper _ bound for @xmath154 .",
    "an interesting application of this scenario is that @xmath174 can be related to the dynamical scale of supersymmetry breaking while @xmath86 is due to the supergravity action .",
    "considering @xmath175gev , we find ( the upper bound is different from eq.([35beta ] ) because the scale of @xmath174 is different . )",
    "@xmath176 and for @xmath177gev we find @xmath178    as in the standard curvaton scenario , the spectral index is given by @xmath179 where @xmath180 ( for the primordial inflaton ) and @xmath32 ( for the slow - roll curvaton field ) are calculated at the horizon exit . if the primordial inflation is of the chaotic type with potential @xmath181 , then @xmath182 . according to observations , @xmath183  @xcite , which leads to @xmath184 for negligible @xmath32 . in the oscillating curvaton scenario ( @xmath185 ) the spectral index excludes @xmath186 , and gives for the running of the spectral index @xmath187",
    "the situation is quite different in the inflating curvaton scenario . because of the second inflation @xmath188 , @xmath186 is not ruled out , while the running of the spectral index is enhanced when @xmath189 , which can have observational impact  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the curvaton idea is that the sector , which gives rise to primordial inflation ( inflaton sector ) , can be decoupled from the sector which gives rise to the curvature perturbation ( curvaton sector ) .",
    "this can naturally accommodate the stability of the hierarchy in scales , which is a feature of the curvaton scenario .",
    "moreover , in the curvaton scenario , the inflaton sector does not even need to feature a fundamental scalar field at all   gravity in the inflationary cosmology was pioneered by starobinsky  @xcite . ] in that sense , the curvaton scenario liberates the inflaton sector from many serious constraints  @xcite .",
    "although the inflaton sector has been investigated in the context of various theoretical models , including the hybrid - type potential for the inflaton field , the curvaton sector is usually considered merely with the simple quadratic potential .",
    "this gives somewhat `` biased '' information about the possibilities for inflationary cosmology . in that sense ,",
    "our paper is an effort to expand the state of the art .",
    "furthermore , the hybrid potential , which is the target in this paper , is well motivated in particle physics without being necessarily tied to the inflaton .",
    "for example , the hybrid structure may appear in guts or brane - brane interactions  @xcite while it can well explain the differences in scales  @xcite . finally , in the hybrid curvaton , the source mechanism of the curvature perturbation is utterly different from the original curvaton scenario . in that sense",
    "the basic formulation is brand - new .    to be more specific , we considered in this paper a new possibility of the curvaton scenario ; we studied oscillating , inflating and non - slow - roll scenarios for the hybrid curvaton . for the slow - roll scenarios we found significant enhancement of the curvature perturbation , while in the non - slow - roll scenarios we found that the tuning requirements for the initial condition are relaxed .",
    "the inflating curvaton predicts distinguishable running of the spectral index , which can not be attained in the usual inflation scenario except for a few extended models . there is a variety of models possible for the hybrid curvaton .",
    "for example , one can consider the curvaton analogues of smooth hybrid inflation  @xcite or shifted hybrid inflation  @xcite .    since the purpose of this paper is not the model building but the basic formulation of the brand - new idea , we avoided highly model - dependent arguments and focused on the simplest model that is useful to explain the essential idea of the scenario .",
    "we have considered @xmath190 because it is the natural choice . however , the scenario with @xmath191 is interesting as well .",
    "a large @xmath4 would reduce the spectrum of the curvature perturbation , but the non - linear evolution might enhance non - gaussianity , in a way that has not been considered yet",
    ". however , the calculation requires numerical study .",
    "we have also considered @xmath86 ( @xmath5 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ) because this is well motivated by supergravity .",
    "@xmath5 is generically a model - dependent parameter and , were it not for the supergravity motivation , there would be no reason to believe that @xmath86 .",
    "finally , we considered that the oscillation starts immediately after the end of the slow - roll evolution to avoid the complexity related to the dynamics of the waterfall .",
    "however , in some cases this dynamics could be non - trivial , which may require numerical calculations .",
