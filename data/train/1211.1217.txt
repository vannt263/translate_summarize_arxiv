    ", theory has to play its usual role of providing reasonable models for interpreting the observed phenomena and suggesting new experiments .",
    "an issue of particular interest in this context concerns the coupling in multi - layer systems @xcite .",
    "the inter - layer coupling determines the mechanisms of transport and propagation of a stimulus applied at one end of the structure and the mechanism of the adjustment of magnetic configurations in metallic multi - layer systems by an external magnetic field . in the context of perpendicular magnetic recording with exchange - spring media ,",
    "improved write - ability is achieved by appropriately tuning the coupling between the soft and hard magnetic layers @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of paramount importance to fathom the nature of interaction acting at the interface and the role it plays in conveying any perturbation through the multi - layer system .",
    "there is a great amount of published work investigating the inter - layer coupling and its effects on the magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "the authors investigated the magnetization dynamics due to spin currents in magnetic double layers and argued that transport in this structure is governed by a kind of long - range interaction called the _ dynamic exchange coupling_. the microscopic mechanism underlying this effective coupling and the way it affects the collective behavior of magnetic hybrid structures require further investigation .",
    "while the rkky coupling provides an interpretation of experiments on very thin conducting spacers assuming a high degree of perfection @xcite , rough surfaces may induce strong stray fields and thereby dipolar coupling in multi - layer systems . for a magnetic bi - layer",
    "several configurations are considered in refs . .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "the calculations confirm the fact that in the absence of roughness the dipolar coupling between two perfectly flat infinite planes vanishes and that for planes of finite dimensions the dipolar coupling may give rise to a ferromagnetic or an anti - ferromagnetic coupling . on the other hand",
    ", one can not exclude the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction , which is an anti - symmetrical exchange interaction and mainly stems from a combination of low symmetry and spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in the presence of disorder , especially at the interface of thin films or multi - layer systems , the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction has been shown to play an important role since local symmetry is broken by surface effects .",
    "indeed , it leads to large anisotropy and may even change the magnetic order , see ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction is induced by spin - orbit coupling between two ferromagnetic layers separated by a paramagnetic layer @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we bring a new contribution that attempts to further clarify the role of three inter - slab couplings , namely exchange , dipolar and dzyaloshinski - moriya , in the spin dynamics and magnetization profile ( mp ) .",
    "it is also essential to compare these interactions with respect to their efficiency in the realignment of the spin configurations and eventually the magnetization reversal .",
    "more precisely , we investigate the effect of coupling ( intensity and nature ) , applied field , and anisotropy on the spin dynamics of a multi - layer system composed of a hard magnetic slab coupled to a soft magnetic slab through a nonmagnetic spacer .",
    "the soft slab is modeled as an array of several atomic layers while the hard layer , of a different material , is either considered as a pinned macroscopic magnetic moment or as an array of atomic planes .",
    "we compute the magnetization profile and hysteresis loop of the whole system by solving the ( coupled ) landau - lifshitz equations for the net magnetic moment of each ( atomic ) layer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction we define the system we study in section ii . in section",
    "iii we deal analytically and numerically with the rigid interface . section iv deals with the soft interface .",
    "it presents the results for the effects of applied field , inter - slab couplings , and their comparison .",
    "it ends with the results of hysteresis loops .",
    "we finally summarize the main results in the conclusion and give a few perspectives for future investigations .",
    "we consider the coupling between two slabs : one is a sufficiently thin hard magnetic system ( hms ) with strong out - of - plane anisotropy and , on top of it , a thick soft magnetic system ( sms ) with in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the sms slab will be modeled as a multi - layer system of atomic planes of e.g. fe , whereas the hms slab will be modeled either as i ) a single macroscopic magnetic moment in which case we have a rigid interface ( ri ) , see fig . [",
    "fig : hsblrigid ] or as ii ) a multi - layer system of atomic planes of e.g. fept , and in this case we get a relaxed or soft interface ( si ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hsblrelaxed ] . in both cases , i.e. sms /hms - ri or sms / hms - si we have an exchange - spring system with a characteristic mp that depends on various physical parameters such as the sms - hms coupling , the anisotropy and exchange coupling within each slab , and the applied field .",
    "accordingly , in this work , we will investigate the effects of these parameters on the mp in the whole system and on the hysteresis loop for the two configurations .",
    "in particular , we will consider and compare the effects of three kinds of inter - slab couplings , which are exchange , dipole - dipole and dzyaloshinski - moriya .",
    "for later reference , we denote by ei - es , ddi - es , and dmi - es the exchange - spring system where sms and hms are respectively coupled by exchange interaction ( ei ) , dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , or dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction ( dmi ) .    [",
    "fig : hsbl ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite the relatively simpler case was considered where both the sms and hms were represented by their respective net magnetic moments .",
    "the relaxation processes of the corresponding magnetic dimer were then studied . in particular , the relaxation rates related with the reversal of its magnetization were computed . moreover ,",
    "the effects of the three couplings mentioned above were investigated for different configurations of the anisotropy easy axes , and at finite temperature . in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in the exchange - spring effect and in the mp at equilibrium and at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , the main objective here is to investigate how the magnetic structure / state of the sms adapts to a change in the physical parameters , especially at the interface .",
    "the exact solution for the mp has been obtained for the system with ri , in the absence of the external magnetic field @xcite . for definiteness ,",
    "the sms - hms lies on the @xmath0 plane and the out - of - plane anisotropy in the hms slab points in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we denote the ( net ) magnetic moments of hms by @xmath2 , and the @xmath3 magnetic moments of the sms by @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , there is a total of @xmath5 magnetic moments in the system pictured here as an open chain of coupled magnetic moments .",
    "indeed , it is assumed that all atomic magnetic moments of each sub - layer @xmath6 in the sms are parallel to each other so that their magnetic state can be represented by the net ( normalized ) magnetic moment @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we do not include boundary effects in this study .",
    "for the hms , @xmath2 represents the net magnetic moment of the whole slab .",
    "the system setup is shown in fig .",

    "setup of the sms / hms system with rigid interface . ]",
    "if we denote by @xmath8 the anisotropy easy axis ( along the @xmath1 axis ) of hms and @xmath9 the anisotropy easy axis , taken here along the @xmath10 axis , of the sms , the total energy of the system can be written as @xmath11    with @xmath12 being the energy of the sms slab .",
    "the first term is the in - plane anisotropy with constant @xmath13 ( s stands for soft ) , the second term is intra - sms nearest - neighbor exchange coupling , of intensity @xmath14 . similarly , the energy of the hms slab contains the out - of - plane anisotropy contribution and the exchange coupling .",
    "however , in the present case of a ri , the energy coupling is dropped since we assume that all atomic magnetic moments within the slab are already tightly bound together by the exchange coupling . on the other hand , the anisotropy contribution is also dropped because it is assumed to be strong enough to pin the macroscopic magnetic moment @xmath2 in the @xmath1 direction .    finally , the interaction between the two slabs will be denoted in the sequel by @xmath15 and will be of three different origins  : exchange , dipolar or dzyaloshinski - moriya . in the present case , @xmath15 is the exchange coupling and will be set to @xmath16 , so that    @xmath17    the analytical solution of the problem requires an additional simplification that consists in setting @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we can write the energy ( in units of exchange coupling ) as @xmath19 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 .    then",
    ", we introduce the coordinate @xmath1 of each atomic sub - layer along the @xmath1 direction , such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the sub - layers at the interface and the top of the sms slab , with @xmath23 being the thickness of the sms slab and @xmath24 that of its atomic sub - layers , _",

    "note that @xmath26 represents the hms slab and a slight shift of @xmath27 in the reference frame between the numerical and the analytical calculations should be taken into account .",
    "indeed , the analytical calculations were performed in the continuum limit .",
    "moreover , the angle deviation with respect to the @xmath1 axis @xmath28 of two adjacent magnetic moments @xmath29 is supposed to be small . for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the equilibrium polar angle of the multilayer system as defined in @xcite . for typical materials",
    "@xmath32 , thus @xmath33 . in such a case one can write down the ( finite - difference ) equation for @xmath34 from the energy minimization .",

    "we solve the set of coupled landau - lifshitz equations ( lle ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ( dimensionless ) effective field comprising the anisotropy and exchange contributions , together with the interaction at the interface .",

    "in these zero - temperature calculations , damping is used to drive the system into the equilibrium state , _",
    "i.e. _ the state of minimal energy .",
    "we start from a state of homogeneous magnetization along the hms anisotropy axis and allow the system to relax towards a minimum that yields the mp of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : avsnxil ] we plot the angle deviation @xmath48 of the magnetic moment of the top sms sub - layer against the number of sub - layers in the sms slab .",
    "the results for three values of the in - plane anisotropy @xmath49 show a good agreement between our numerical results and eq .",
    "( [ eq : smstoplayer ] ) .",
    "one can also see how @xmath50 depends on @xmath49 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : minimalnumber ] ) . for a weak @xmath49 the system behavior",
    "is dominated by the fixed magnetic moment of the hms slab through the interface exchange coupling .",
    "adding more sub - layers to the sms slab attenuates this effect since the interface interaction is counter - balanced by the anisotropy and intra - layer interaction of each sms sub - layer , leading eventually to a deviation of the magnetic moment of the top sms sub - layer for @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath49 increases , the contribution of each sms sub - layer to the energy of the whole system increases , thus leading to a smaller @xmath50 .",
    "in the previous section , we defined a model for a system with rigid interface and energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyrigidinterface ] ) .",
    "the agreement with the previously published analytical work validates the numerical approach used here , which can now be employed to deal with more complex systems that are difficult to tackle analytically .",
    "more precisely , we extend the previous model by replacing the macroscopic magnetic moment @xmath2 of the hms , that was pinned along the anisotropy direction , by @xmath52 sub - layers each with an out - of - plane ( in the @xmath1 direction ) uniaxial anisotropy of intensity @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in the present case we apply an external magnetic field @xmath54 at an angle @xmath55 with respect to the @xmath1 axis .",

    "in order to better understand the effects of each variable we set to zero all those that we are not studying , with only two exceptions , namely @xmath49 , which takes the value of @xmath47 for all the profile plots and various values for @xmath85 and @xmath86 variation .",

    "the system can be viewed as an `` inverted '' rigid magnet , where the sms and the hms ( net ) magnetic moments at the interface are pinned in - plane .",
    "the out - of - plane variation of the hms magnetic moment results from the competition between the hms intra - slab exchange interaction and anisotropy .",
    "in this situation , the variation in the hms magnetization can be calculated by using eq .",

    "[ fig : jvsxivsdm_mp_ri ] we present different magnetic profiles for typical values of the ei ( @xmath135 ) , ddi ( @xmath136 ) and dmi ( @xmath137 ) , as can be found in refs .",

    "the black curve with circles is the mp with only ei at the interface and serves as a reference .",
    "the red curve with squares is the mp obtained as we add ddi .",
    "compared to the ei strength , the ddi is two orders of magnitude weaker and thereby its contribution to the alignment of the magnetic moments at the interface is very small .",
    "nonetheless , it tends to align the interface along the @xmath1 axis and this effect propagates throughout all sub - layers by the in - plane exchange interaction , causing a global decrease in the mp .",
    "the dark blue curve ( triangles up ) represents the mp for ddi only .",
    "we see that the weak ddi is not sufficient to overcome the anisotropy of each sub - layer , leading only to a slight deviation near the interface but away from the latter each slab remains parallel to its easy axis .",
    "we observe an increased ( induced ) deviation in the sms as compared to that of the hms .",
    "this is due to the stronger anisotropy of the hms enhanced by the ddi - induced anisotropy in the @xmath1 direction , making the out - of - plane direction more favorable at the interface than the in - plane direction . on the other hand , for the reasons given earlier",
    ", the dmi with its vector @xmath115 along the @xmath10 axis , leads to a similar result with each slab aligned along its own easy axis even near the interface .",
    "the mp in the azimuthal direction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jvsxivsdm_mp_ri ] ( right ) compares the three inter - slab couplings .",
    "the ei and ddi are two interactions that do not induce an azimuthal rotation and the corresponding mp always lies in the same plane ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the green curve ( with diamonds ) is the mp obtained after adding dmi with its vector @xmath116 in the @xmath10 direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jvsxivsdm_mp_ri ] we see that the dmi induces a slight decrease in the deviation @xmath118 because the dmi tends to align the magnetic moments of the sms slab along the @xmath119 axis , as is seen previously in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmixphil ] .",
    "even though the magnitude of this interaction was not high enough to overcome the anisotropy and internal exchange , it induced a deviation at the interface in the azimuthal direction .",
    "this deviation is , however , constrained by the ei at the interface and the anisotropies of the slabs .",
    "the light blue curve ( triangles down ) represents the mp for dmi with no exchange at the interface .",
    "as it could be expected , the magnetic moments of the hms are all aligned along the @xmath1 axis ( recall that @xmath116 is along the @xmath10 axis ) , while those of the sms slab are all in the @xmath0 plane with a higher @xmath130 deviation at the interface than in the previous case .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that now the dmi competes only with the anisotropy of the sms slab .      here",
    "we present a succinct study of the hysteresis loop for different values of the interaction .",
    "it helps us to understand how the switching mechanism of the multi - layer system changes with the nature and strength of the inter - slab coupling .",
    "all the hysteresis curves presented are plots of the normalized magnetization @xmath139 versus reduced applied magnetic field @xmath75 , along the hms anisotropy axis ( @xmath1 axis ) .",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we start in a state of zero magnetization ( _ i.e. _ the magnetic moments of all sub - layers are on the plane with no applied field ) and iterate the lle ( [ eq : lle ] ) until we reach the state of minimal energy .",
    "next , we increase the applied field slightly and wait for the system to reach the new equilibrium state .",
    "we keep increasing the applied field until we reach saturation of the magnetization .",
    "then , we ramp the field down and up again thus closing the hysteresis loop . obviously , for each value of @xmath75 , we wait until the state of minimal energy is reached .",
    "figure [ fig : hysteresishz ] ( a ) shows hysteresis cycles for different values of ei . let us denote by @xmath142 the sms switching field , by @xmath143 the hms switching field , and by @xmath144 the saturation field of the whole multi - layer system . with no interaction ( @xmath145 ) and for @xmath146",
    "the equilibrium state is that where the magnetic moments ( of hms and sms ) are oriented along their respective easy axes , _",

    "the net magnetization of the system is that given by the hms net magnetic moment projected on the @xmath1 axis .",
    "when @xmath75 is increased the magnetic moments of the sms start to rotate towards the applied field in a reversible process until the system reaches saturation ( @xmath150 for all @xmath151 ) at @xmath152 .",

    "further increase of the applied field ( in the opposite direction ) induces a slight reversible deviation of the hms magnetization . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresishz ] ( a ) this corresponds to the plateau ( on the @xmath145 curve ) from @xmath156 to @xmath157 , until @xmath75 reaches the hms anisotropy field @xmath158 . at this value of the field ,",
    "the hms magnetic moments coherently switch from @xmath159 to @xmath160 , thus achieving negative saturation . along the lower branch",
    "the system follows the same switching process from @xmath161 to @xmath103 .    for nonzero but weak coupling , @xmath162",
    ", the system follows the same behavior , but neither the hms nor the sms goes through a coherent rotation because of the inter - slab interaction .",
    "the sms saturation field @xmath142 is now higher because its magnetization is stabilized by the interaction with the hms . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath163 decreases because the molecular field of the already reversed sms acts against the hms anisotropy field . for stronger ei ( @xmath164 )",
    "the plateau disappears completely ( @xmath165 ) , indicating that once the sms magnetic moments reach a certain deviation , the ei induces a cascade effect in the hms that causes the switching of the latter .",
    "the same observations of nonuniform magnetization switching leading to a smaller coercive field were made for magnetic recording exchange - spring media @xcite .",
    "finally , an increase of the ei increases the remanent magnetization .",
    "the coercive field increases as long as @xmath166 .",
    "as soon as the ei becomes strong enough to observe the cascade effect ( @xmath167 ) , the coercive field becomes a decreasing function of ei .",
    "now , since the inter - layer exchange coupling decreases for an increasing spacer thickness , the coercive field passes by a minimum when the latter increases , again in agreement with what has been observed in refs . .",
    "weak ( @xmath168 ) or medium ( @xmath169 ) ddi has a similar behavior to that of the ei , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresishz ] ( b ) .",
    "there is some difference , however , between the ei and ddi regarding the evolution of the hysteresis cycle as the inter - slab coupling is varied . while increasing ei decreases @xmath144 , the ddi induces an increase of @xmath144 with increasing @xmath102",
    "indeed , ddi whose bond is along the @xmath1 axis induces an additional anisotropy at the interface along this axis and thereby tends to stabilize the magnetization in this direction . for @xmath170",
    "the induced anisotropy field is stronger than the hms anisotropy field .",
    "this implies that it is possible for the magnetic moments of the hms that are far from the interface to switch before those at the interface .",
    "when the applied field becomes in excess of the induced - anisotropy field a complete switching is achieved . finally , both the remanent magnetization and coercive field increase with ddi .",
    "the effect of the dmi along the @xmath1 axis on the hysteresis cycle is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresishz ] ( c ) . a similar behavior to those exhibited by ei and ddi for weak interaction ( @xmath171 )",
    "is observed .",
    "again , we observe a progressive rotation of the sms magnetization before the applied field becomes strong enough to induce a reversal of the hms magnetization . as we discussed earlier",
    ", with no applied field the dmi along the @xmath1 axis induces a variation in the deviation of the magnetic moments of the hms , while pinning the sms ( net ) magnetic moment along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the slight deviation induced in the magnetic moments of the hms leads to a reduced hms switching field @xmath163 .",
    "further increase of the interaction ( @xmath172 ) induces again a cascade effect in the hms that causes both slabs to switch in the same field ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "however , we have to note that unlike ei and ddi , the hms / sms switching field is not equal to @xmath144 .",
    "this is again due to the deviation induced in the hms magnetic moments by dmi .",
    "both the remanent magnetization and the coercive field decrease with increasing dmi .",
    "we can see that each kind of interaction induces a specific `` single magnetic moment''-like behavior for strong coupling @xmath15 .",
    "a strong ei tends towards a system with no anisotropy , whereby the area of the loop tends to vanish , reaching saturation with very low applied fields in a switch - like behavior .",
    "ddi on the other hand tends to induce a square loop , typical of a very high uniaxial anisotropy with easy axis parallel to the applied field .",
    "finally , the dmi tends to narrow the cycle and the magnetization follows the applied field , typical of a system with uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the field .",
    "obviously , the perfect `` single magnetic moment '' behavior is never reached because the inter - slab interaction is present only at the interface and the deviation of the outer sub - layers is limited only by the intra - slab exchange interaction and the applied field .",
    "we have studied a magnetic multi - layer system composed of a hard magnetic slab with out - of - plane uniaxial anisotropy and a soft magnetic slab with in - plane uniaxial anisotropy , separated by a nonmagnetic spacer .",
    "we have considered three cases of inter - slab coupling , namely exchange , dipolar or dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions .",
    "the soft magnetic slab has been modeled as a stack of atomic ( e.g. fe ) layers , while the hard magnetic slab has been modeled either as a macroscopic magnetic moment or as another stack of atomic ( e.g. fept ) layers .",
    "each atomic layer is modeled as a macroscopic magnetic moment representing its net magnetic moment , and is coupled to adjacent layers by exchange coupling .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the external magnetic field , the in - plane or out - of - plane anisotropy , and the three interactions on the deviation angle ( relative to the hard slab anisotropy easy axis ) .",
    "we have computed the magnetization profile through the whole multi - layer system .",
    "our computing method consists in solving the set of ( coupled ) landau - lifshitz equations for the net magnetic moments of the layers .",
    "we first validate this method by comparing the corresponding results to the previously obtained analytical expressions for the case of exchange inter - slab coupling .    for the effect of the applied magnetic field",
    ", we found that with sufficient number of layers in the soft slab , the system behaves according to the stoner  wohlfarth regime and that there exists a critical field",
    "at which the whole system aligns along the applied field .    for exchange and dipolar interactions",
    ", there is an asymptotic value that depends on the anisotropy and the intra - layer exchange . for the dipolar interaction with a bond along the hard slab anisotropy , this asymptotic value",
    "is given by the analytical expression for rigid interface , where the hard slab is modeled as a single pinned magnetic moment , and only the variation in the soft slab is relevant .",
    "the dipolar interaction was next extended through the whole soft slab with a rigid interface .",
    "the ensuing effect on the magnetization profile of the soft slab has been recovered by an effective dipolar coupling at the interface only , upon re - scaling the intra - slab exchange coupling .",
    "the two corresponding effective coupling parameters depend on the initial dipolar interaction , but not on the number of sms layers .    for the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction",
    ", we found that the magnetic moments of one of the slabs are pinned in a given direction , whereas those of the remaining slab rotate in either the polar angle or the azimuthal angle , depending on the direction of the vector @xmath116 .",
    "large values of the dm coupling lead to a system with rigid interface , with the magnetic moments at the interface being perpendicular to each other and to the vector @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , a switch - like mechanism can be achieved with this interaction .",
    "indeed , an indirect reversal of the sms magnetization can be achieved by directly forcing a reversal of the hms magnetization with the help of a magnetic field .",
    "it is obviously also possible to obtain the desired effect for the exchange - spring system by achieving the reversal of hms via the switching of the sms magnetization with the help of a smaller magnetic field .",
    "a comparison between the three interactions with typical orders of magnitude has been given .",
    "the exchange coupling shows the strongest effect , and when added , the dipolar and dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions induce a slight ( but non negligible ) deviation in either the polar or azimuthal magnetization profile .    finally , hysteresis cycles for the three different interactions are computed . a typical exchange spring behavior , where the soft slab switches first , followed by the hard slab at a stronger field , is observed for weak interaction in all cases .",
    "strong coupling causes both slabs to switch under the same field .",
    "exchange and dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions tend to narrow the cycle , while the dipolar interaction leads to squared cycles . for application purposes such as magnetic recording using vertical exchange - spring media ,",
    "the dzyaloshinski - moriya inter - layer coupling strongly reduces the coercive field while keeping high values of the anisotropy which thus ensure good thermal stability .    a work in progress consists in treating each atomic layer as a two - dimensional lattice with the aim to compute spin correlations as functions of the various energy parameters and to determine the spin - wave spectrum . in the near future",
    ", this zero - temperature study will be extended to finite temperature with the aim to investigate thermal effects with special emphasis on the calculation of activation rates of such multi - layer systems and thereby assess their thermal stability ."
