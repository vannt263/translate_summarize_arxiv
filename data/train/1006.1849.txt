    "in proton - proton collisions , the factorised form of the inclusive cross section is given by , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the parton - level scattering cross section for parton @xmath2 to scatter off parton @xmath3 normalised to the hadron - hadron flux and @xmath4 into @xmath1 . ] and the sum runs over the possible parton types @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the probability of finding a parton of type @xmath2 in the proton carrying a momentum fraction @xmath5 is described by the parton distribution function @xmath6 . by applying suitable cuts ,",
    "one can study more exclusive observables such as the transverse momentum distribution or rapidity distributions of the hard objects ( jets or vector bosons , higgs bosons or other new particles ) produced in the hard scattering .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) prediction is a useful guide to the rough size of the cross section , but is usually subject to large uncertainties from the dependence on the unphysical renormalisation and factorisation scales , as well as possible mismatches between the ( theoretical ) parton - level and the ( experimental ) hadron - level .",
    "the theoretical prediction may be improved by including higher order perturbative predictions which have the effect of ( a ) reducing the renormalisation / factorisation scale dependence and ( b ) improving the matching of the parton level event topology with the experimentally observed hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "the partonic cross section @xmath1 has the perturbative expansion @xmath7 where the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) strong corrections are identified . for many processes ,",
    "knowledge of the nlo correction is sufficient .",
    "however , for the main @xmath8 or @xmath9 scattering processes such as drell - yan , higgs production , di - jet production , vector - boson plus jet , vector - boson pair production or heavy quark pair production , the nlo corrections still have a large theoretical uncertainty and it is necessary to include the nnlo perturbative corrections .",
    "in addition to reducing the renormalisation and factorisation scale dependence there is an improved matching of the parton level theoretical jet algorithm with the hadron level experimental jet algorithm because the jet structure can be modeled by the presence of a third parton . in this talk , we are mainly concerned with the nnlo corrections to di - jet production where the resulting theoretical uncertainty is estimated to be at the few per - cent level  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    finally we generate points corresponding to the final and initial state single collinear regions of the phase space . for the final - final collinear singularity , fig .",
    "[ fig : scollff](a ) shows the @xmath10-distribution for a range of values of @xmath11 .",
    "similarly in the initial - final collinear limit , we show the distributions of @xmath10 for small values of @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scollif](a ) .",
    "we see that the subtraction term , which is based on azimuthally averaged antennae functions does not accurately describe the azimuthal correlations present in the matrix elements and antenna functions when a gluon splits into two collinear gluons .",
    "this is the reason why the distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig : scollff](a ) and [ fig : scollif](a ) have such a broad shape .",
    "it is clear that as we approach the collinear limits @xmath13 , the azimuthal terms are not suppressed and the subtraction term is not , point by point , an adequate representation of the matrix element .",
    "nevertheless , the azimuthal terms coming from the single collinear limits do vanish after an azimuthal integration over the unresolved phase space .",
    "here we are performing a point - by - point analysis on the integrand defined by the matrix element squared and the subtraction term .",
    "one possible strategy is to introduce a correction term @xmath14 to the @xmath15 four - gluon antenna functions which reconstructs the angular terms  @xcite .",
    "subtracting @xmath14 from the final - final and , initial - final and initial - initial configurations ( by crossing momenta to the initial state ) produces a subtraction term that is locally free of angular terms .     for 10000 single final state",

    "fig : scollff](b ) and  [ fig : scollif](b ) . for 10000 final state single collinear phase space points and @xmath20 we obtained an average @xmath21 and a standard deviation of @xmath22 .",
    "we repeated the same analysis for the initial state collinear configuration for @xmath23 and obtained an average of @xmath24 and a standard deviation of @xmath25 .",
    "for both cases , the distributions now peak around @xmath26 with a more pronounced peak as the limit is approached , just as in the double unresolved and single soft limits discussed earlier .",
    "this demonstrates the convergence of the counterterm to the matrix element .",
    "however , the azimuthal correction term @xmath14 has the unfortunate side effect of generating new divergences which are not present in the matrix element .",
    "a second more successful approach is to cancel the angular terms by combining phase space points related to each other by a rotation of the system of unresolved partons @xcite . when both collinear partons are in the final state , this can be achieved by considering pairs of phase space points which are related by rotating the collinear partons by an angle of @xmath19 around the resultant parton direction .",
    "similarly , for the initial - final state collinear configurations produced when @xmath27 for @xmath28 and with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the phase space points should again be related by rotations of @xmath19 about the direction of @xmath31 .",
    "this has the consequence of rotating @xmath32 off the beam axis and therefore has to be compensated by a lorentz boost .",
    "the effect of combining pairs of phase space points is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : scollff](c ) and  [ fig : scollif](c ) .",
    "we see that the distributions for both final - final and initial - final collinear limits have a very sharp peak around @xmath26 . for the final state singularity and @xmath20 we obtained an average of @xmath33 and a standard deviation of @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , for the initial state collinear singularity and @xmath23 we found @xmath35 and @xmath36 . there is an enormous improvement compared to the raw distributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : scollff](a ) and [ fig : scollif](a ) and a significant improvement compared to adding an azimuthal correction term shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : scollff](b ) and [ fig : scollif](b ) .",
    "the phase space point averaged subtraction term clearly converges to the matrix element as we approach the single collinear limit and correctly subtracts the azimuthally enhanced terms in a point - by - point manner .",
    "in this contribution , we have discussed the application of the antenna subtraction formalism to construct the subtraction term relevant for the six - gluon double real radiation contribution to di - jet production .",
    "the subtraction term is constructed using four - parton and three - parton antennae .",
    "we showed that the subtraction term correctly describes the double unresolved limits of the @xmath37 process .",
    "in particular , by combining phase space points , the subtraction term avoids the problems associated with angular correlations produced when a gluon splits into two collinear gluons .",
    "the final goal is the construction of a numerical program to compute nnlo qcd estimates of di - jet production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
