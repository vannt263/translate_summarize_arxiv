    "for continuously varying one - parameter families of iterated maps in @xmath0 , discontinuous changes in the size of an attractor are the most easily observed type of global bifurcations , including changes in the basin boundary ( metamorphasis ) .",
    "these changes can occur as the result of a change in stability of the recurrent set .",
    "a more general situation occurs when discontinuous changes in attractors occur as the result of a discontinuous change in the size of the recurrent set itself .",
    "such a global bifurcation is called an * explosion*. for the last several years , we have been studying explosions and their properties , including a classification of explosions at heteroclinic tangencies for planar diffeomorphisms  @xcite , and more recently a numerical study of the statistical properties of a certain kind of explosions that occur in dimension three and higher  @xcite . our research , as well as that of many others  @xcite , has been guided by a 1976 conjecture of newhouse and palis  @xcite .",
    "( see also the restatements in  @xcite ) . for over thirty years , this conjecture has managed to elude proof .",
    "the conjecture says that for for generic planar diffeomorphisms , all explosions occur through the following two local bifurcations : saddle - node bifurcations and homoclinic bifurcations . in this paper",
    ", we prove that the conjecture is true for smooth interval maps .",
    "in addition , we are able to give a full classification of which types of tangencies give rise to explosions .",
    "these are important and new result in themselves .",
    "they are for example in contrast with a recent result of horita , muniz , and sabini  @xcite , showing that in a probabilistic sense , the newhouse palis conjecture is not true for circle maps . in a broader sense",
    ", we are hopeful that the insight gained from the one - dimensional case will give rise to insights leading to the proof of the planar case of the newhouse palis conjecture .",
    "it is clear that an isolated saddle node bifurcation for either a fixed point or periodic orbit gives rise to a local explosion , since new periodic points appear .",
    "however , in many cases in both one and higher dimensions , a saddle node bifurcation also gives rise to a global bifurcation .",
    "the set of recurrent points changes discontinuously as the parameter is varied at points not contained in the saddle node periodic orbit .",
    "for example , the period three window in the chaotic attractor for the logistic map corresponds to an explosion : for parameter values less than a bifurcation value , there is a global attractor which comprises the full recurrent set .",
    "it consists of an interval . after the bifurcation parameter ,",
    "the global attractor consists only of a period three orbit , and the full recurrent set is a nowhere dense cantor set within the attractor interval .",
    "an explosion occurs at the bifurcation parameter , and it is due to a saddle - node bifurcation at a point inside the global attractor .",
    "saddle node bifurcations an invariant circles are another well - studied examples of this phenomenon .    in all dimensions , explosions due to",
    "a homoclinic or heteroclinic bifurcation essentially occur due to the creation of a homoclinic tangle when stable and unstable manifolds interesect transversally . in one and two dimensions ,",
    "the transition between no intersection and transverse intersections involve tangencies between the stable and unstable manifolds of fixed or periodic points ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the hnon map and ikeda map contain well studied examples of explosions which are a result of homoclinic bifurcations . in higher dimensions",
    ", such bifurcations can occur without tangencies  @xcite .",
    "such a bifurcation leads to unstable dimension variability  @xcite .    in our previous work for planar maps",
    ", we gave a precise classification for which types of tangencies for heteroclinic cycles will result in explosions .",
    "we called this class of cycles * crossing cycles * , because the different stable and unstable manifolds involved in the cycle lie _ across _ the tangency from each other .",
    "we show here that the same results hold for interval maps .",
    "our main results are as follows :    [ t : explosions ] for generic one - parameter families of smooth maps of the interval with homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles ( hypotheses h1 - 6 ) , explosions occur in if and only if there is an isolated crossing orbit .",
    "[ t : general ] explosions within generic one - parameter families of smooth maps of the interval ( hypotheses h1 - 3 ) are the result of either a tangency between stable and unstable manifolds of fixed or periodic points or a saddle node bifurcation of a fixed or periodic point .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : in section  [ s : def ] , we give basic definitions of explosions and homoclinic tangencies .",
    "we are considering the particular recurrence class of chain recurrent points , which are defined in this section as well . in section  [",
    "s : homo ] , we prove the explosions at tangencies theorem . in section  [ s :",
    "mainproof ] , we prove the general explosion classification theorem .",
    "our results rely on a very sophisticated and well - developed theory for the dynamics of interval maps .",
    "we have briefly stated the necessary results in the course of the proof .",
    "we now give some formal definitions of concepts described in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth one - parameter family of maps .",
    "we exchangeably write two notations : @xmath2 . for the definition of an explosion it is more natural to use the concept of chain recurrence rather than recurrence .",
    "the relationship between chain recurrence and other types of recurrence is discussed in  @xcite .    for an iterated function @xmath3",
    ", there is an * @xmath4-chain * from @xmath5 to @xmath6 when there is a finite sequence @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "if there is an @xmath4-chain from @xmath5 to itself for every @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) , then @xmath5 is said to be * chain recurrent *  @xcite .",
    "the * chain recurrent set * is the set of all chain recurrent points . for a one - parameter family @xmath14",
    ", we say @xmath15 is chain recurrent if @xmath5 is chain recurrent for @xmath14 .",
    "if for every @xmath12 , there is an @xmath4-chain from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and an @xmath4-chain from @xmath6 to @xmath5 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are said to be in the same * chain component * of the chain recurrent set .",
    "the chain recurrent set and the chain components are invariant under forward iteration .",
    "the following definition is for an explosion bifurcation in the chain recurrent set .",
    "such a definition can be formulated for the non - wandering set as well .    a * chain explosion point * @xmath16 is a point such that @xmath5 is chain recurrent for @xmath17 , but there is a neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath5 such that on one side of @xmath19 ( i.e. either for all @xmath20 or for all @xmath21 ) , no point in @xmath18 is chain recurrent for @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath5 is not necessarily an isolated point of the chain recurrent set .",
    "for example , at a saddle node bifurcation on an invariant circle , the chain recurrent set consists of two fixed points prior to bifurcation and the whole circle at and in many cases after bifurcation .",
    "the chain recurrent set is not invariant under backwards iteration of a noninvertible map .",
    "thus explosion points are not preserved under iteration , forward or backward .",
    "the following lemma states what is guaranteed by the fact that chain recurrence is preserved under forward iteration .",

    "specifically , there exists @xmath25 such that there is no chain recurrent point in @xmath26 for all @xmath20 , but @xmath5 is chain recurrent at @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath27 is chain recurrent at @xmath19 , but @xmath27 may also be chain recurrent for @xmath20 .",

    "we now give definitions of homoclinic and heteroclinic points .",
    "note that for a diffeomorphism , homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits require the existence of saddle points with stable and unstable manifolds of dimension at least one .",
    "thus they can only occur in dimension two or greater . however , for noninvertible maps , it is possible to have fixed or periodic points with one - dimensional unstable manifolds and a zero - dimensional stable manifolds .",
    "marotto terms such points snap - back repellers  @xcite .",
