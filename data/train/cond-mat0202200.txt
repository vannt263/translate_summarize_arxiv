    "percolation is the classic model for disordered systems @xcite . for concreteness we will study bond percolation systems in which bonds on a lattice are randomly occupied with probability @xmath5 .",
    "clusters are defined as groups of sites and bonds which are connected by occupied bonds .",
    "clusters can be decomposed into objects known as blobs .",
    "blobs are sets of sites and bonds which can not be decomposed into disconnected sets by cutting only one bond .",
    "equivalently blobs are sometimes described as being multiply - connected  there are at least two disjoint paths between each point in a blob and every other point in the blob .",
    "the decomposition of the entire percolation cluster into blobs has been extensively studied @xcite , as has the distribution of sizes of blobs in the backbone @xcite . for both cluster and backbone blobs ,",
    "the fractal dimension of the blobs is the fractal dimension of the backbone .",
    "here we address the questions of ( i ) whether there are more fundamental objects into which blobs can be decomposed , and ( ii ) whether these objects then be further decomposed . to answer these questions",
    ", we employ the language of graph theory , in which sites are the vertices and bonds are the edges of a graph @xcite",
    ".    one can define @xmath0-connected graphs ( or @xmath0-blocks ) as graphs which can not be separated into disconnected subgraphs by cutting the graph at fewer than @xmath0 vertices @xcite .",
    "thus , clusters are 1-blocks and blobs are 2-blocks . the natural next level of decomposition of percolation systems is to decompose blobs(2-blocks ) into 3-blocks . by the definition above , 3-blocks are graphs which can not be decomposed by cutting the graphs at fewer than 3 vertices . from a physicist s point of view , one can understand what 3-blocks are by considering a blob as a resistor network with each bond being a resistor .",
    "assume one is trying to determine the resistance between 2 vertices of the network .",
    "one can simplify the network by using kirchoff s laws to replace groups of sequential bonds and groups of parallel bonds by single virtual bonds having resistance equivalent to the bonds replaced .",
    "after this has been done as completely as possible , what are left are 3-blocks .",
    "we define the mass of a 3-block as the number of virtual bonds plus the number of non - replaced original bonds remaining in the 3-block .",
    "figures [ tpodecomp ] and [ preal ] provide examples of the decomposition of a blob into 3-blocks . it has been shown @xcite that the decomposition of 2-blocks into 3-blocks is unique .    determining the scaling of the distribution of the 3-blocks into which the 2-blocks can be decomposed is the subject of this paper . in graph theory , the sites are typically not constrained to a lattice structure , and one is only concerned with the topology of the graphs ; we will , however , work on square and cubic lattices .",

    "this suggests that while the actual values of @xmath4 may be within the bounds we have estimated , the actual values will be consistent with @xmath97 .    as in 2d , if we do not replace two - terminal objects in a 3-block by a single virtual bond , the fractal dimension of the 3-block is that of a blob(see fig .",

    "then @xmath104 it has been observed @xcite that @xmath105 is the codimension of the percolation cluster and @xmath106 is the codimesion of the backbone .",

    "possibly similar methods can be employed to find the fractal dimension of @xmath0-bones ( and therefore @xmath0-blocks ) with @xmath114 to high precision .",
    "the process of replacing a 2-terminal object , @xmath115 , by a single virtual bond and then replacing 2-terminal objects within @xmath115 by single virtual bonds and so on is reminiscent of the decimation process in renormalization group ( rg ) approaches to percolation @xcite .",
    "it is here , however , that the similarity ends .",
    "the decimation process performed in the decomposition into 3-blocks is an exact decimation performed on objects in individual realizations while the rg decimation is performed on the lattice and is an approximation , except for hierarchical lattices .",
    "also , the purpose of the decomposition into 3-blocks is to improve computational performance and analyze the properties of substructures of the cluster while the purpose of rg calculations is to find properties of percolation analytically .",
    "finally , whereas rg approaches on hierarchical lattices result in objects that are finitely ramified , the decomposition into 3-blocks we perform maintains the infinite ramification of the euclidean lattice .",
    "the fact that the fractal dimension of 3-blocks is significantly smaller than the fractal dimension of 2-blocks has important computational implications .",
    "we can efficiently calculate properties(e.g .",
    "resistance , velocity distributions , self avoiding walk statistics ) of a percolation cluster or backbone as follows :    * decompose the cluster or backbone into 2-blocks * decompose the 2-blocks into 3-blocks * calculate the desired properties of the 3-blocks * algebraically determine the properties of the 2-blocks from the properties of the 3-blocks * algebraically determine the properties of the cluster or backbone from the properties of the 2-blocks .    in many cases",
    "the computation will require less cpu ( computer processing ) resource when the complexity of the computation is a power law or exponential of the mass of the object for which the property is being calculated . by decomposition",
    "we make the mass of these objects smaller .",
    "reduced cpu resource usage is also obtained if only a decomposition into 2-blocks is made although the saving are less .",
    "systems of larger size than could be treated before can now be treated when we decompose into 3-blocks because the fractal dimension of the 3-blocks are lower than that of the object in which they are embedded ; this is not true if we only decompose into 2-blocks .    as an example of the dramatically smaller size of the largest 3-block versus the size of the largest blob consider a 3d system of size @xmath116 . at criticality",
    ", the largest mass blob in the backbone will be of the order @xmath117 while the mass of the largest 3-block in the backbone will be of @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ preal ] we show an actual simulation realization in which a blob of 950 bonds is decomposed into a 3-block with only 216 virtual bonds , greatly reducing the computational complexity .",
    "traditionally the decomposition of percolation systems has been to decompose the system into clusters ( 1-blocks ) and to decompose the clusters into blobs ( 2-blocks ) .",
    "we extend this decomposition by decomposing 2-blocks into 3-blocks .",
    "3-blocks are especially interesting because in contrast to 1- and 2-blocks , the 3-blocks have the property that they can be nested .",
    "that is , 2-terminal objects , which are replaced by single virtual bonds in a 3-block , can themselves contain other 3-blocks . because of this replacement of a 2-terminal object by a virtual bond , the fractal dimension of 3-blocks is significantly smaller than the fractal dimension of 2-blocks .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this smaller fractal dimension has important computational implications for the size of percolation systems which can be analyzed and the speed at which the analysis can be performed .",
    "in addition , within the error bars of our calculations , the values for the 3-block fractal dimension appear to be identical for 2d and 3d systems .",

    "<S> these fractal dimensions are significantly smaller than the fractal dimensions of the blobs , making possible more efficient calculation of percolation properties . additionally , the closeness of the estimated values for @xmath4 in 2d and 3d is consistent with the possibility that @xmath4 is dimension independent . generalizing the concept of the backbone </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the concept of a `` @xmath0-bone '' , which is the set of all points in a percolation system connected to @xmath0 disjoint terminal points ( or sets of disjoint terminal points ) by @xmath0 disjoint paths . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the fractal dimension of a @xmath0-bone is equal to the fractal dimension of @xmath0-blocks , allowing us to discuss the relation between the fractal dimension of @xmath0-blocks and recent work on path crossing probabilities .    2 </S>"
