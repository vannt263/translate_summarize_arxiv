    "the following interesting problem from contemporary theory of peano continua and combinatorial group theory has been widely discussed and investigated ( most recently at the 2011 workshop on wild topology in strobl , austria @xcite ) , because it concerns two well - known and important @xmath0-dimensional spaces , namely the _ griffiths _ space @xmath1 and the _ harmonic _ archipelago @xmath2 ( cf .",
