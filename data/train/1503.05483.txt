    "zero - point contributions would cancel in a world with exact supersymmetry because of the sign change between boson and fermion contributions in eq.(6 ) .    in quantum field theory ( without coupling to gravity ) the zero - point energy is removed by normal ordering so that the zero of energy is defined as the energy of the vacuum .",
    "this can be done because absolute energies here are not measurable observables .",
    "before we couple to gravity , only energy differences have physical meaning , _",
    "e.g. _ in casimir processes  @xcite which measure the force between parallel conducting plates in qed and which contribute a `` cavity term '' to the mass of the proton in bag models of quark confinement .",

    "suppose one can argue away zero - point contributions to the vacuum energy .",

    "the higgs condensate gives @xmath53 56 orders of magnitude larger and with opposite negative sign to the observed value @xmath54 the qcd quark condensate gives about @xmath55 .",
    "if there is a potential in the vacuum it will , in general , correspond to some finite vacuum energy .",
    "why should the sum of many big numbers ( plus any possible gravitational counterterm ) add up to a very small number ?",
    "the higgs and qcd condensates form at different times in the early universe , suggesting some time dependence to @xmath7 .",
    "further large condensate contributions might be expected also in grand unified theories .",
    "what might the cosmological observations and particle physics being telling us ?",
    "it is interesting that the dark energy or cosmological constant scale @xmath56 in eq.(9 ) is of the same order that we expect for the light neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "light neutrino mass values @xmath57 0.004 - 0.007 ev are extracted from studies of neutrino oscillation data assuming normal hierarchy and values less than about 0.02 ev are obtained with inverted hierarchy @xcite .",
    "that is , one finds the phenomenological relation @xmath58 where @xmath59 gev is logarithmically close to the planck mass @xmath60 and typical of the scale that appears in grand unified theories .",
    "there are also theoretical hints that this large mass scale might perhaps be associated with dynamical symmetry breaking , see below .",
    "the gauge bosons in the standard model which have a mass through the higgs mechanism are also the gauge bosons which couple to the neutrino .",

    "the non - perturbative structure of chiral gauge theories is not well understood .",
    "if taken literally eq.(10 ) connects neutrino physics , higgs phenomenon in electroweak symmetry breaking and dark energy to a new high mass scale which needs to be understood .",
    "we next argue how this physics might be connected , first treating neutrino chirality by analogy with the `` spins '' in an ising - like system that becomes active near the planck mass @xcite .",
    "then , in section 3.2 we discuss recent lhc results which , when evolved to large scales , suggest stability or metastability of the standard model vacuum and which might hint at possible critical phenomenon at some very large scale .      changing the external parameters of the theory can change the phase of the ground state .",
    "for example , qed in 3 + 1 dimensions with exactly massless electrons is believed to dynamically generate a photon mass @xcite . in the schwinger model for 1 + 1",

    "scalar confinement implies dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and a fermion condensate @xmath61 .",
    "this scalar condensate is absent if there is no right - handed fermion participating in the interaction .",
    "suppose that the theory is ultraviolet consistent , _",
    "e.g. _ that it is embedded in a larger theory to ensure anomaly cancellation necessary for gauge invariance and renormalisability .",
    "switching off the coupling of su(2 ) gauge bosons to right - handed fermions must induce some modification of the non - perturbative propagators .",
    "either confinement is radically reorganised or one goes to a coulomb phase or to a higgs phase whereby the coulomb force is replaced by a force of finite range with finite mass scale and the issues associated with infrared slavery are avoided .",
    "we next suppose the confinement to higgs transition applies .",
    "that is , we suppose that the non - perturbative ground state of chiral gauge theory is in a higgs phase .",
    "anomaly cancellation in the ultraviolet is required by gauge invariance and renormalisability .",
    "if some dynamical process acts to switch off the coupling of left- or right - handed fermions , it will have important consequences for the theory in the ultraviolet limit and should therefore be active there . if symmetry breaking is dynamical and hence non - perturbative it will appear with coefficients smaller than any power of the running coupling .",
    "suppose an exponentially small effect @xcite . dynamical symmetry breaking then naturally induces a symmetry breaking scale @xmath62 which is much smaller than the high energy scales in the problem @xmath63 . if we take the mass scale @xmath63 to be very large , _",
    "e.g. _ close to the planck scale , then the expression @xmath64 naturally leads to hierarchies .",

    "we next consider a phenomenological trick to investigate the different scales in the problem .",
    "analogies between quantum field theories and condensed matter and statistical systems have often played an important role in motivating ideas in particle physics .",

    "the free energy density is equal to minus the pressure @xmath72  that is , the model equation of state looks like a vacuum energy term in einstein s equations of general relativity , @xmath73 .",
    "we take @xmath74 to be large and close to the planck mass .",
    "the exponential suppression factor @xmath75 then ensures that non - renormalisable fluctuations associated with the ising - like interaction are negligible in the ground state , which is in the spontaneous magnetisation phase involving just left - handed `` neutrinos '' .",
    "following our previous discussion , it seems reasonable to believe that the su(2 ) gauge symmetry coupled to the neutrino is now spontaneously broken , that is the su(2 ) gauge symmetry associated with the w@xmath10 and z@xmath11 bosons is in the higgs phase .",
    "weak interactions mean that we have two basic scales in the problem : @xmath76 and the electroweak scale @xmath62 induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "for a spin model type interaction , the ground state with left - handed `` spin '' chiralities is characterised by vanishing energy density .",
    "excitation of right - handed chiralities is associated with the large scale @xmath77 .",

    "the next generation electron edm experiments expect to probe up to the 100 tev scale . precision measurements of the neutron and nuclear edms @xcite and tests of cpt and lorentz invariance @xcite are so far all consistent with the standard model .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility that the standard model might work up to a scale close to the planck mass @xcite with stable or metastable vacuum , as well the implications for possible deeper structure and the vacuum energy puzzle .",
    "possibly , the standard model might be emergent as the long range tail of some critical planck system @xcite .",
    "whilst the standard model has proved very successful everywhere it has been tested we know that some extra physics needed to explain the very small neutrino masses , the baryon asymmetry and strong cp problems as well as dark matter and inflation .",

    "recent perturbative renormalisation group ( rg ) calculations suggest that the standard model vacuum with the measured higgs and top quark masses @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev  @xcite might be stable or metastable ( with half - life much greater than the present age of the universe ) @xcite .",

    "these calculations assume perturbative evolution of the standard model up to the highest possible scales of order the planck mass without coupling to additional `` new physics '' ( including any possible quantum gravity or possible dark matter candidates ) in the evolution . the rg calculations involve three families of fermions active in the rg equations and the higgs boson is taken as elementary in these calculations .",

    "experiments will push the high - energy and precision frontiers of subatomic particle physics .",
    "is new physics `` around the corner '' or might the standard model work up to a very large scale , perhaps close to the planck mass and perhaps hinting at critical new phenomena in the ultraviolet ? understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe and the cosmological constant vacuum energy puzzle promises to teach us a great deal about the intersection of subatomic physics and dynamical symmetry breaking on the one hand , and gravitation on the other .",
