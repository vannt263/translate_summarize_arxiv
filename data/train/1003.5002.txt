    "the algebraic @xmath0- and @xmath1-theory of group rings  @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a ring @xmath4 and a group @xmath5  are highly significant , but are very hard to compute when @xmath5 is infinite .",
    "the main ingredient for their analysis is the farrell - jones conjecture .",
    "it identifies them with certain equivariant homology theories evaluated on the classifying space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath5 . roughly speaking",
    ", the farrell - jones conjecture predicts that one can compute the values of these @xmath0- and @xmath1-groups for @xmath6 if one understands all of the values for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 runs through the virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath5 .",
    "why is the farrell - jones conjecture so important ?",
    "one reason is that it plays an important role in the classification and geometry of manifolds .",
    "a second reason is that it implies a variety of well - known conjectures , such as the ones due to bass , borel , kaplansky and novikov .",
    "( these conjectures are explained in section  [ sec : some_well - known_conjectures ] . )",
    "there are many groups for which these conjectures were previously unknown but are now consequences of the proof that they satisfy the farrell - jones conjecture .",
    "a third reason is that most of the explicit computations of @xmath0- and @xmath1-theory of group rings for infinite groups are based on the farrell - jones conjecture , since it identifies them with equivariant homology groups which are more accessible via standard tools from algebraic topology and geometry ( see section  [ sec : computational_aspects ] ) .",
    "the rather complicated general formulation of the farrell - jones conjecture is given in section  [ sec : the_general_formulation_of_the_farrell - jones_conjecture ] .",
    "the much easier , but already very interesting , special case of a torsionfree group is discussed in section  [ sec : the_farrell - jones_conjecture_for_torsionfree_groups ] . in this situation the @xmath0- and @xmath1-groups",
    "are identified with certain homology theories applied to the classifying space @xmath9 .",
    "the recent proofs of the farrell - jones conjecture for hyperbolic groups and @xmath10-groups are deep and technically very involved .",
    "nonetheless , we give a glimpse of the key ideas in section  [ sec : methods_of - proof ] . in each of these proofs",
    "there is decisive input coming from the geometry of the groups that is reminiscent of non - positive curvature . in order to exploit these geometric properties",
    "one needs to employ controlled topology and construct flow spaces that mimic the geodesic flow on a riemannian manifold .    the class of groups for which the farrell - jones conjecture is known is further extended by the fact that it has certain inheritance properties .",
    "for instance , subgroups of direct products of finitely many hyperbolic groups and directed colimits of hyperbolic groups belong to this class . hence , there are many examples of exotic groups , such as groups with expanders , that satisfy the farrell - jones conjecture because they are constructed as such colimits .",
    "there are of course groups for which the farrell - jones conjecture has not been proved , like solvable groups , but there is no example or property of a group known that threatens to produce a counterexample .",
    "nevertheless , there may well be counterexamples and the challenge is to develop new tools to find and construct them .    the status of the farrell - jones conjecture is given in section  [ sec : the_status_of_the_farrell - jones_conjecture ] , and open problems are discussed in section  [ sec : open_problems ] .",
    "in this section we briefly recall some well - known conjectures . they address topics from different areas , including topology , algebra and geometric group theory .",
    "they have one  at first sight not at all obvious  common feature .",
    "namely , their solution is related to questions about the @xmath0- and @xmath1-theory of group rings .",

    "for example , the spheres @xmath12 are topologically rigid , as predicted by the _ poincar conjecture_. a connected manifold is called _ aspherical _ if its homotopy groups in degree @xmath13 are trivial .",
    "a sphere @xmath12 for @xmath14 has trivial fundamental group , but its higher homotopy groups are very complicated .",
    "aspherical manifolds , on the other hand , have complicated fundamental groups and trivial higher homotopy groups",
    ". examples of closed aspherical manifolds are closed riemannian manifolds with non - positive sectional curvature , and double quotients @xmath15 for a connected lie group @xmath1 with @xmath16 a maximal compact subgroup and @xmath17 a torsionfree cocompact discrete subgroup .",

    "[ con : borel ] closed aspherical manifolds are topologically rigid .",

    "mostow rigidity_. one version of mostow rigidity says that two hyperbolic closed manifolds of dimension @xmath18 are isometrically diffeomorphic if and only if their fundamental groups are isomorphic .",

    "one of the main ideas is not to cover @xmath5 itself , but to enlarge @xmath5 to @xmath307 for an appropriate compactification @xmath308 of a certain contractible metric space @xmath89 that has an isometric proper cocompact @xmath5-action .",
    "this allows us to spread out the open sets and avoid having too many intersections .",
    "this strategy has also been successfully used in measurable group theory , where the role of the topological space @xmath308 is played by a probability space with measure preserving @xmath5-action ( see gromov  @xcite ) .",
    "the elements under consideration lie in @xmath0- or @xmath1-theory spaces associated to the control space @xmath5 . using a transfer",
    "they can be lifted to @xmath307 .",
    "( this step corresponds in the proofs of farrell and jones to the passage to the sphere tangent bundle . )",
    "we gain control there and then push the elements down to @xmath5 . since the space @xmath308 is contractible ,",
    "its euler characteristic is @xmath67 and hence the composite of the push - down map with the transfer map is the identity on the @xmath0-theory level . on the @xmath1-theory level one needs something with signature @xmath67 . on the algebra level this corresponds to the assignment of a finitely",
    "generated projective @xmath24-module @xmath78 to its _ multiplicative hyperbolic form @xmath309_. it is given by replacing @xmath310 by @xmath311 in the standard definition of a hyperbolic form , i.e. , the underlying @xmath24-module is @xmath312 and the symmetric form is given by the formula @xmath313 .",
    "notice that the signature of @xmath314 is @xmath67 and taking the multiplicative hyperbolic form yields an isomorphism of rings @xmath315 .",
    "we can construct @xmath225-coverings that are contracting in the @xmath5-direction but will actually expand in the @xmath308-direction .",
    "the latter defect can be compensated for because the transfer yields elements over @xmath307 with arbitrarily good control in the @xmath308-direction .",
    "to find such coverings of @xmath316 , it is crucial to construct , for hyperbolic and @xmath10-spaces , flow spaces @xmath317 which are the analog of the geodesic flow on a simply connected riemannian manifold with negative or non - positive sectional curvature .",
    "one constructs appropriate coverings on @xmath317 , often called _ long and thin coverings _ , and then pulls them back with a certain map @xmath318 . the flow is used to improve a given covering .",
    "the use flow spaces to gain control is one of the fundamental ideas of farrell and jones ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "let us look at a special example to illustrate the use of a flow .",
    "consider two points with coordinates @xmath319 and @xmath320 in the upper half plane model of two - dimensional hyperbolic space .",
    "we want to use the geodesic flow to make their distance smaller in a functorial fashion .",
    "this is achieved by letting these points flow towards the boundary at infinity along the geodesic given by the vertical line through these points , i.e. , towards infinity in the @xmath321-direction .",
    "there is a fundamental problem : if @xmath322 , then the distance of these points is unchanged",
    ". therefore we make the following prearrangement .",
    "suppose that @xmath323 .",
    "then we first let the point @xmath319 flow so that it reaches a position where @xmath324 . inspecting the hyperbolic metric , one sees that the distance between the two points @xmath325 and @xmath326 goes to zero if @xmath327 goes to infinity .",
    "this is the basic idea to gain control in the negatively curved case .",
    "why is the non - positively curved case harder ?",
    "again , consider the upper half plane , but this time equip it with the flat riemannian metric coming from euclidean space .",
    "then the same construction makes sense , but the distance between two points @xmath325 and @xmath326 is unchanged if we change @xmath327 .",
    "the basic first idea is to choose a focal point far away , say @xmath328 , and then let @xmath325 and @xmath326 flow along the rays emanating from them and passing through the focal point @xmath57 . in the beginning",
    "the effect is indeed that the distance becomes smaller , but as soon as we have passed the focal point the distance grows again .",
    "either one chooses the focal point very far away or uses the idea of moving the focal point towards infinity while the points flow . roughly speaking",
    ", we are suggesting the idea of a _ dog and sausage _ principle .",
    "we have a dog , and attached to it is a long stick pointing in front of it with a delicious sausage on the end .",
    "the dog will try to reach the sausage , but the sausage is moving away according to the movement of the dog , so the dog will never reach the sausage .",
    "( the dog will become long and thin this way , but this is a different effect ) .",
    "the problem with this idea is obvious , we must describe this process in a functorial way and carefully check all the estimates to guarantee the desired effects .",
    "it is conceivable that our methods can be used to show that virtually poly - cyclic groups belong to @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "this already implies the same conclusion for cocompact lattices in almost connected lie groups following ideas of farrell - jones  @xcite and for fundamental groups of ( not necessarily compact ) @xmath329-manifolds ( possibly with boundary ) following ideas of roushon  @xcite .",
    "show that solvable groups belong to @xmath278 or @xmath279 . in view of the large class of groups belonging to @xmath278 or @xmath330",
    ", it is very surprising that it is not known whether a semi - direct product @xmath331 for a ( not necessarily finitely generated ) abelian group @xmath107 belongs to @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "the problem is the possibly complicated dynamics of the automorphism @xmath332 of @xmath107 .",
    "such groups are easy to handle in the baum - connes setting , where one can use the long exact wang sequence for topological @xmath0-theory associated to a semi - direct product .",
    "such a sequence does not exists for algebraic @xmath0-theory , and new contributions involving nil - terms occur .",
    "show that mapping class groups , @xmath333 and thompson s groups belong to @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "the point here is not that this has striking consequence in and of itself , but rather their proofs will probably give more insight in the farrell - jones conjecture and will require some new input about the geometry of these groups which may be interesting in its own right .",
    "a very interesting open case is @xmath334 .",
    "the main obstacle is that @xmath334 does not act cocompactly isometrically properly on a @xmath10-space ; the canonical action on @xmath335 is proper and isometric and of finite covolume but not cocompact .",
    "the baum - connes conjecture is also open for @xmath334 .",
    "there is no group known for which the farrell - jones conjecture is false .",
    "there has been some hope that groups with expanders may yield counterexamples , but this hope has been dampened since colimits of hyperbolic groups satisfy it . at the moment one does not know any property of a group which makes it likely to produce a counterexample .",
    "the same holds for the borel conjecture .",
    "many of the known exotic examples of closed aspherical manifolds are known to satisfy the borel conjecture .",
    "the baum - connes conjecture is unknown for all @xmath10-groups .",
    "can one use the techniques of the proof of the farrell - jones conjecture for @xmath10-groups to prove the baum - connes conjecture for them ?",
    "in particular it is not at all clear how the transfer methods in the farrell - jones setting carry over to the baum - connes case . in the other direction , the dirac - dual dirac method , which is the main tool for proofs of the baum - connes conjecture , lacks an analog on the farrell - jones side .",
    "the farrell - jones conjecture is also very useful when one considers not necessarily aspherical manifolds .",
    "namely , because of the surgery sequence  , it gives an interpretation of the structure set as a relative homology group .",
    "so it simplifies the classification of manifolds substantially and opens the door to explicit answers in favorable interesting cases . here , a lot of work can and will have to be done .",
