    "the large values of the solar ( @xmath4 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath5 ) mixing angles in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite may be telling us about some new symmetries of leptons not presented in the quark sector and may provide a clue to the nature of the quark - lepton physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "if there exists such a flavor symmetry in nature , the tribimaximal ( tbm )  @xcite pattern , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , for the neutrino mixing will be a good zeroth order approximation to reality .",
    "a non - abelian discrete symmetry @xcite could play an important role in predicting the mixing angles .",
    "for example , in a well - motivated extension of the sm through the inclusion of @xmath9 discrete symmetry , the tbm pattern comes out in a natural way in the work of  @xcite .",
    "although such a flavor symmetry is realized in nature leading to exact tbm , in general there may be some deviations from tbm  @xcite .",
    "recent data of the t2k , minos and double chooz  @xcite collaborations imply that the unknown mixing angle , @xmath1 , can be relatively large , indicating a deviation from the exact tbm which leads to vanishing @xmath10 violation in neutrino oscillations . and ,",
    "the analysis based on global fits  @xcite of neutrino oscillations enter into a new phase of precise measurements of the neutrino mixing angles and mass - squared differences , indicating that the tbm mixing for three flavors of leptons should be modified .",

    "and we know nothing about all three @xmath10-violating phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "besides the mystery of the mixing pattern , tiny neutrino mass is one of the most challenging problem beyond sm .",
    "it suggests that neutrinos could be induced by a radiative correction or tiny couplings if a theory be within tev scale .",
    "several years ago , ernest ma introduced the so - called radiative seesaw mechanism  @xcite where the masses are generated through one - loop effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the existence of the flavor neutrino mixing for the three neutrinos @xmath16 implies that the individual lepton charges , @xmath17 , are not conserved  @xcite , the observation of neutrino oscillation have the possibility of measurable branching ratio for charged lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) decays such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , etc .. experimental discovery of such lepton rare decay processes is one of smoking gun signals of physics beyond sm .",
    "our starting point is an effective lagrangian obeying the discrete @xmath20 symmetry which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath21 singlet scalar fields at a scale higher than the electroweak scale . in addition , we assign a @xmath22-odd quantum number to a new higgs doublet and three right - handed singlet fermions while all sm particles are @xmath22-even parity , in order to explain both the tbm at tree level lagrangian and dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath22 symmetry is exactly conserved and a @xmath22-odd doublet higgs that does not have vev , so called _ inert higgs _ , while the standard higgs boson get a vev , which means the yukawa coupling corresponding to @xmath22-odd higgs doublet will not generate the dirac mass terms in neutrino sector .",
    "thus , the usual seesaw mechanism does not work any more and we naturally have a good candidate of dm corresponding to the lightest @xmath22-odd particle or large hadron collider ( lhc ) signals through the standard gauge interactions in our scenario",
    ". the assigned leptonic flavor symmetry will lead us to a neutrino mass matrix through one - loop mediated by a new higgs doublet and right - handed neutrinos having @xmath22-odd parity , and indicating the deviations from tbm in lepton sector by dimension-5 effective operators driven by @xmath21 singlet scalar fields with a cutoff scale @xmath23 . here",

    "we analyze possible spectrums of light neutrinos and their flavor mixing angles . in order to investigate the relation between dm and a non - zero @xmath1 , we focus on a normal hierarchical mass spectrum of light neutrinos .",
