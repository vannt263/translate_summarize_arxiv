    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the single - particle electron quantum states near these points are well - described by the dirac equation @xcite , where the wavefunctions have a spinor structure due to the two - point basis of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the wavefunctions in the vicinity of each of the dirac points are chiral , leading to a berry s phase when a particle is dragged around either one of them .",
    "this has important consequences for transport , most notably an absence of backscattering that inhibits localization @xcite and a finite conductivity even when undoped @xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the graphene structure has been theoretically shown to shift both shubnikov - de haas oscillations @xcite , and the step pattern of the integer quantized hall effect @xcite .",

    "all these properties may be understood in terms of non - interacting electrons in the graphene bandstructure .",
    "how do electron - electron interactions impact the properties of graphene ? to sensibly explore this question requires an understanding of the low - lying excitations of the interacting system .",
    "various parts of these spectra may in some cases be measured by inelastic light scattering @xcite or microwave absorption @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a study of these excitations in the quantum hall regime .    for a standard 2deg , a seminal paper by kallin and halperin @xcite demonstrated that for densities such that the non - interacting spectrum ",
    "highly degenerate landau levels with a harmonic oscillator spectrum  has its fermi energy in a gap , the low - lying collective mode spectrum may be interpreted in terms of a single particle - hole pair excited across the gap .",
    "the attractive interaction between these particles binds them into an exciton , which carries a well - defined momentum @xmath0 in spite of the magnetic field because the object as a whole is neutral . at small @xmath1",
    ", the exciton dispersion behaves as some form of density wave , typically either a magnetoplasmon or a spin density wave , depending on the quantum numbers of the electron and hole . at larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the dispersion crosses over smoothly into a form expected for a particle - hole pair with separation @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the magnetic length and @xmath4 the magnetic field .",
    "a simple classical interpretation of the excitation in this limit is that the mutual attraction of the particle and hole at some separation precisely cancels the lorentz force when they move together at an appropriate velocity , establishing a connection between the momentum of the object and the particle - hole separation .    in graphene",
    "this simple picture necessarily breaks down , because in the absence of a magnetic field , particles and holes move at a constant speed set by the linear spectrum around the dirac points . nevertheless , as we shall see the results for the quantum spectrum of these excitations are qualitatively quite similar to those of the 2deg .",
    "the main differences arise from the relatively large number of states within each landau level  there are two spin states and two valley states for each landau state  which allows for sixteen different excitations when the electron and hole have different landau indices .",
    "we shall further see that the large number of levels leads to stronger many - body corrections to the simple two - body model described above than is the case for the 2deg .    in what follows",
    "we will examine the exciton spectrum of this system in two different ways , first as a two - body problem of a positively and negatively charged particle each with a graphene spectrum in a magnetic field , and then as a many - body problem in which a single particle is excited across the fermi level of a filled fermi sea . at large momentum @xmath1",
    "we will see these spectra largely agree ( up to a constant which is undetermined in the first approach ) , while at small @xmath1 there can be considerable difference .",

    "we solve for the spectrum in the presence of the coulomb interaction , incorporating several landau levels with an eye towards measuring the degree of landau - level mixing . in section [ sec",
    ": many - body ] , we introduce the many - body problem with a detailed discussion of the low - lying excitations of the non - interacting system , for a variety of configurations of the chemical potential .",
    "the mixing of some of these excitations can be anticipated from the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "the momentum - dependent exciton energies are then calculated and catalogued according to spin and pseudospin quantum numbers .",
    "we conclude by highlighting some salient features of the neutral excitations in graphene , contrasting them with those of the 2deg .",
    "the calculation of matrix elements and dispersions is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the continuum limit of non - interacting graphene is obtained by adopting a @xmath5 approximation @xcite about each of the two dirac points , which we label using a pseudospin @xmath6 with eigenvalues @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a given spin state ,",

    "it has an essential two - body nature and can not be reduced to a choice of single - particle basis .",

    "the splitting of each level into 4 spin and pseudospin sublevels enlarges the realm of possibilities .",
    "we use the notation @xmath94 for the number of filled sublevels in landau level @xmath30 , where @xmath30 refers to the highest landau level with filled sublevels .",
    "thus , the undoped system with chemical potential @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath96 , whereas placing the chemical potential between landau levels @xmath30 and @xmath97 is denoted as @xmath98 .",

    "the peaks and valleys apparent in the exciton dispersions of figures [ fig : dispersion ] and [ fig : dispersion_gne4 ] are of particular interest , because they lead to van hove singularities in the collective mode density of states .",
    "such singularities are in principle detectable in inelastic light scattering @xcite and , via coupling through disorder , microwave absorption @xcite .",
    "thus it is useful to know when and where such singularites might be found . to compute them more accurately",
    ", we now turn to the many - body formulation of this problem .",
    "we study the many - body exciton dispersion by diagonalizing the many - body interacting hamiltonian on a subspace of trial wavefunctions , which consist of a single electron excited from the fermi sea . in the 2deg ,",
    "this procedure is known to give results for the exciton dispersion that coincide with those obtained from the poles of response functions computed in a generalized random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite . indeed , these wavefunctions are exact in the non - interacting case , and should thus provide a good basis for the weakly interacting regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the validity of these wavefunctions may persist for stronger interactions if the landau level mixing is weak .",
    "experience has shown that in the 2deg , the degree of landau level mixing is considerably less than one would naively anticipate based on the ratio of potential and kinetic energies .",
    "this mixing is known to be small @xcite even when this ratio is of order unity .    in the case of graphene , this notion is supported by the results of the previous section . in the two - body calculation , where we take @xmath128 , we find that in the lowest exciton state , landau level mixing occurs at a low level , causing the inflections in the dispersion to become somewhat more pronounced , but otherwise having little qualitative effect . from this",
    "we conclude that reasonably accurate results for the lowest exciton states may be obtained using only those electron and hole landau levels nearest the fermi energy .",
    "thus , we focus our attention on exciton states in which the landau level indices of the electron and hole differ by at most @xmath137 .    as in the previous section , we make the approximation that the coulomb interaction has su(2 ) symmetry with respect to the two sublattices . in this approximation , the coulomb interaction conserves pseudospin in addition to the usual spin conservation . as a result ,",
    "exciton states mixed by the coulomb interaction have the same net @xmath138 and @xmath6 and consequently have the same net contribution to the non - interacting energy from zeeman and pseudospin splitting .",
    "we restrict our consideration of mixing to those exciton states with the same non - interacting energy .",
    "in fact , such degeneracy is almost always due to the several possible spin and pseudospin configurations of the individual electron and hole when the net @xmath138 or @xmath6 is zero . due to the nonuniform spacing of landau levels in graphene , two electron - hole pairs with different landau level indices",
    "will not have the same kinetic energy unless one of the pairs has @xmath139 .",
    "the only exception occurs when @xmath133 , in which case the non - interacting states @xmath140 and @xmath141 have the same kinetic energy . under these considerations , we concentrate on the cases @xmath133 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131",
    ". in particular , the first case offers the possibility of landau level mixing for @xmath142 and intra - level spin and pseudospin waves for @xmath143 .    at this level of approximation , the dispersion relation @xmath144 for an exciton can be written @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath138 , and @xmath6 are , respectively , the combined kinetic energy , spin , and pseudospin of the electron and hole .",
    "the superscript @xmath147 provides an arbitrarily assigned index for the several branches of the additional contribution @xmath148 due to interactions .    in our many - body approach",

    "the first is the direct coulomb interaction between the excited electron and hole , whose matrix elements are identical to those found in the two - body approach of the previous section .",
    "this `` excitonic effect '' can be obtained in a diagrammatic expansion by including vertex corrections @xcite . in our continuum approximation , this contribution only scatters between exciton states if the electron and hole individually have the same @xmath138 and @xmath6 in the initial and final state .",
    "the second is the exchange term or `` depolarization effect , '' which is the only contribution present in rpa .",
    "physically , it represents the annihilation of the electron - hole pair at one point in space and its recreation at another point .",
    "this process only affects excitons with vanishing net @xmath138 and @xmath6 .",
    "finally , each single - particle sublevel has an associated self - energy which arises from exchange interactions with those occupied sublevels in the fermi sea having the same spin and pseudospin .",
    "this effect provides a @xmath1-independent shift to the exciton dispersion , guaranteeing that its energy is always non - negative .",
    "it also pushes the @xmath113 limit above the non - interacting energy .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : g4 ] for the simplest case @xmath150 .",
    "there are 16 exciton states with minimal kinetic energy which are differentiated by the spin and pseudospin sublevels of the electron and hole .",
    "direct interactions only scatter electrons ( holes ) into electron ( hole ) sublevels with the same @xmath138 and @xmath6 , and thus do not cause mixing .",
    "exchange interactions scatter among the 4 states with @xmath151 .      the case @xmath153 , @xmath143 , is shown in figure [ fig : ll_lz0 ] .",
    "the lowest exciton states actually have zero kinetic energy ; the excitation is a pure spin or pseudospin wave within the landau level .",
    "neither the direct nor exchange interactions mix the states . the dispersions are identical to that of the two - body case up to a constant due to the exchange self - energy correction as well as zeeman and pseudospin splitting .      the most interesting scenario is illustrated in figures [ fig : g1]-[fig : g3 ] for the cases @xmath154 .",
    "since the levels @xmath155 are equally spaced , there are excitons with @xmath142 whose kinetic energies are degenerate and may be split by landau level mixing .",
    "this is caused by the direct coulomb interaction , which admixes states connected by a wavy line .",
    "as in the @xmath98 case , the @xmath151 excitons are mixed by the exchange interaction .",
    "note that the number of exciton states with given values of @xmath138 and @xmath6 is closely tied to the number of filled sublevels .",
    "we now derive the three many - body contributions by diagonalizing the hamilonian on the subspace of trial wavefunctions .",
    "the matrix elements between the non - interacting exciton states are @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the filled fermi sea .",

    "we assume that the direct interaction with the fermi sea is cancelled by a neutralizing background charge .",
    "the calculation of these matrix elements is greatly simplified by separating the relative and center - of - mass motion of the electron and hole by means of the canonical transformation developed for the two - body problem .",
    "the computation of matrix elements and @xmath164 is discussed extensively in the appendix .    for a given chemical potential ,",
    "interactions give rise to several branches @xmath165 .",
    "since there are fewer distinct branches than there are states ( 16 states in the case @xmath142 , 4 for @xmath143 , ) some of the exciton states remain degenerate . some of this degeneracy may remain even after pseudospin and zeeman splitting are taken into account , which is readily done by inspection of the @xmath138 and @xmath6 quantum numbers in table [ tab : qnumbers ] .",

    "<S> we then turn to the many - body problem , where particle - hole symmetry and the existence of two valleys lead to a number of effects peculiar to graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the coupling together of a large number of low - lying excitations leads to strong many - body corrections , which could be observed in inelastic light scattering or optical absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss in detail how the appearance of different branches in the exciton dispersion is sensitive to the number of filled spin and valley sublevels . </S>"
