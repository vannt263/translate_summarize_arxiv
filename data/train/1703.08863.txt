    "in @xcite , the first author presented an algorithm for the rigorous computation of @xmath0-functions associated to automorphic forms .",
    "the algorithm is efficient when one desires many values of a single @xmath0-function or values of many @xmath0-functions with a common @xmath4-factor . in this paper",
    ", we explore the prototypical case of a family of @xmath0-functions to which that does not apply , namely maass cusp forms in the eigenvalue aspect .    as described in @xcite , one of the main challenges when computing @xmath0-functions is the evaluation of the inverse mellin transform of the associated @xmath4-factor .",
    "rubinstein @xcite describes an algorithm based on continued fractions that performs well in practice , but for which it seems to be very difficult to obtain rigorous error bounds . on the other hand ,",
    "the algorithm in @xcite , following dokchitser @xcite , uses a precomputation based on simpler power series expansions that are easy to make rigorous ; it works well for motivic @xmath0-functions of low weight , but suffers from catastrophic precision loss when the shifts in the @xmath4-factor grow large , as is the case for maass forms .",
    "a well - known similar problem occurs when one attempts to evaluate an @xmath0-function high up in the critical strip .",
    "rubinstein , following an idea of lagarias and odlyzko @xcite , has demonstrated that this can be dealt with effectively by multiplying by an exponential factor to compensate for the decay of the @xmath4-factor ; specifically , for a complete @xmath0-function @xmath5 of degree @xmath6 , one works with @xmath7 for a suitable @xmath8 .",
    "this idea can be made to work for general @xmath0-functions , including those associated to maass forms ( albeit with the problems related to precision loss noted above , if the @xmath4-factor is not fixed ) , and molin @xcite has worked out rigorous numerical methods in quite wide generality .",
    "for the specific case of maass cusp forms , vishe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has shown that the `` right '' factor to multiply by to account for the variation in both @xmath2 and the @xmath4-factor shifts is not the exponential function @xmath9 , but rather the hypergeometric function @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the parity of the maass form , and @xmath12 is its laplacian eigenvalue . to understand the motivation for this factor , consider first the case of a classical holomorphic cuspform @xmath13 , for which the @xmath0-function is defined via the mellin transform @xmath14",
    "since @xmath13 is holomorphic and vanishes in the cusp , we can change the contour of integration from @xmath15 to @xmath16 for some @xmath17 ; writing @xmath18 for @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath20 thus , rubinstein s exponential factor arises naturally from a contour rotation .    for a maass form @xmath13 of weight @xmath21 and even parity ( say )",
    ", we similarly have the integral representation @xmath22 since @xmath13 is no longer holomorphic in this case , we can not simply rotate the contour in this expression , but we are free to start with the rotated integral @xmath23 and try to relate it back to @xmath5 . as we show in  [ s : prelim ] , this can be done , and the two are related essentially by the factor .",
    "we analyze this strategy in greater detail in  [ s : prelim ] , but the upshot is that to compute maass form @xmath0-functions for a wide range of values of @xmath24 and @xmath2 , it suffices to compute @xmath25 for suitable values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in turn , using modularity to move each point to the fundamental domain , the problem reduces to computing the @xmath28-bessel function @xmath29 for various @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "fortunately , that is a problem that underlies all computational aspects of maass cusp forms and has been well studied ; see , for instance , @xcite .      in  [",
    "s : results ] , using as input the rigorous numerical maass form data of @xcite we compute values of the corresponding maass form @xmath0-functions and use the resulting numerical data to test conjectures about the distribution of zeros of maass form @xmath0-functions in the @xmath2- and @xmath24-aspects . in particular , we show that the phenomenon of zero repulsion around @xmath31 that strmbergsson observed @xcite disappears in the large eigenvalue limit .",
    "we derive rigorous error estimates and use the interval arithmetic package mpfi @xcite throughout our computations to manage round - off errors .",
    "thus , modulo bugs in the software or hardware , our numerical results are rigorous .",
    "let @xmath32 be a cuspidal maass newform and hecke eigenform of weight @xmath21 and level @xmath33",
    ". then @xmath13 has a fourier expansion of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36th hecke eigenvalue of @xmath13 , @xmath12 is its eigenvalue for the hyperbolic laplacian @xmath37 , @xmath38 indicates the parity , and @xmath39 moreover , @xmath13 is related to its dual @xmath40 via the fricke involution , so that @xmath41 for some complex number @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "associated to @xmath13 we have the @xmath0-function @xmath44 , defined for @xmath45 by the series @xmath46 it follows from that @xmath44 continues to an entire function and satisfies a functional equation relating its values at @xmath47 and @xmath48 . to see this ,",
