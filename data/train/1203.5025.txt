    "topological insulators ( tis ) have drawn quite intensive attention recently owing to the gapless surface / edge states , topologically protected against perturbations which do not close the bulk gap.@xcite similarly to graphene,@xcite exciting physical properties are expected if the ti surface / edge states are made gapped , resulting in  e.g.  half - quantized surface hall effect,@xcite topological magneto - electric effects,@xcite and majorana zero states .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that such effects can be triggered via the proximity effect of tis to magnetically ordered materials or superconductors , in which case new terms which impose or break certain symmetries are introduced into the effective hamiltonian .",
    "one particularly interesting situation arises if the time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath0 ) in a ti is broken via a controlled perturbation .",
    "the definition of the @xmath1 topological invariant , used to classify two - dimensional ( 2d ) insulators into ordinary insulators and tis , is hinged on the presence of the time - reversal symmetry in the system.@xcite it still remains an open question of how to generalize the @xmath1 topological invariant when @xmath0 is broken .",
    "in such a case , it is suggested@xcite that it is plausible to use the so - called spin chern number:@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the chern numbers for the spin `` up '' and `` down '' manifolds of the occupied states . since the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in general induces spin mixing , the spin chern number is well defined only when the system exhibits a gap in the spectrum of @xmath5 in addition to being a band insulator . in this case",
    "@xmath6 proves to be equivalent to the @xmath1 number when time - reversal symmetry is present.@xcite for models of tis@xcite and graphene,@xcite the spin chern number picture proved to be valid , while a more detailed analysis of this concept in real materials investigated from first principles is still lacking .",
    "owing to @xmath0 symmetry , the surface / edge states of tis are spin degenerate , making it hard to manipulate and exploit their transport properties in experiments based on magnetic detection .",
    "while the quantum hall effect usually requires a very large magnetic field to emerge , in this sense , the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect in ferromagnets would be much more suited for future spintronics .",
    "the qah effect , which has attracted a lot of attention recently but so far has not been verified experimentally , occurs in 2d chern insulators@xcite with broken @xmath0-symmetry , exhibiting overall spin - polarized edge states carrying quantized electric charge . up to now , it is believed that tis can be turned into chern insulators via magnetic doping@xcite but it still remains an experimentally unsolved problem despite recent advances in this direction.@xcite in this light , it is necessary to explore how tunable 2d tis are under @xmath0-broken perturbations , in particular , exchange interactions .",
    "bismuth is the heaviest atom with a stable isotope and strong spin - orbit coupling makes it an important ingredient of the newly discovered tis such as bi@xmath7se@xmath8@xcite and bi@xmath9sb@xmath10.@xcite ultrathin bi(111 ) films , which can be produced experimentally on different substrates,@xcite are also predicted to be 2d tis.@xcite in our study we take bi(111 ) bilayer as a representative of the latter class of tis . in this work",

    "the bi(111 ) bilayer@xcite @xmath11 in an external exchange field using first principles methods .",
    "we found that at small exchange fields the bilayer is in the time - reversal broken topological insulator phase , which can be characterized by non - trivial values of spin chern numbers , transverse spin hall conductivity , and spin polarization of the edge states .",
    "increasing the magnitude of the exchange field further drives the system first into a metal and then into a qah phase .",
    "detailed analysis of the electronic structures reveals that spin - mixing is important for closing the bulk gap and chern number exchange between valence and conduction bands . at last , we analyze the spin - polarization of the metallic edge states in different phases , show that its sign can be controlled by the strength of the exchange field , and prove that its magnitude is large enough to be observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments .",

    "the distance between the two layers were 4.52    and 1.67   , respectively ( see also fig .  4 ) .",
    "our theoretical investigations are based on density functional theory.@xcite we apply the local density approximation  @xcite to the exchange - correlation potential and use the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) as implemented in the fleur code.@xcite the self - consistent calculations with soc were carried out with the cut - off parameter k@xmath12 of 3.8  bohr@xmath13 and 50 @xmath14-points in the full two - dimensional brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the muffin - tin radius of 2.5  bohr was used .",
    "the band structure of the system with soc is presented in fig .",
    "the wannier functions technique was used on top of self - consistent dft calculations to derive an accurate tight - binding hamiltonian of the system.@xcite moreover , we have constructed the matrix elements @xmath15 of the pauli matrices @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the occupied bloch wave functions .",
    "these matrices were evaluated from the dft calculations and transformed into the real space representation in terms of maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs).@xcite this allowed us to take into account an exchange field applied perpendicularly to the surface of the bilayer by adding a @xmath18 term on top of the original hamiltonian , and to provide an ability to accurately evaluate spin polarization @xmath19 ( see caption of fig .  4 for details ) .",
    "in general , applying an exchange field lifts the spin degeneracy , where spin - up ( spin - down ) states get higher ( lower ) in energy spectra , and the difference of the occupation of spin - up and spin down leads to the spin - polarization @xmath19 which can be positive ( negative ) along the direction of exchange fields . in fig .",

    ". @xcite    examining the electronic structure of the system , presented in fig .",
    "2 , reveals that it is the spin - mixing accompanied by the exchange of the chern number between valence and conduction bands that leads to the phase transition from the @xmath0-conserved ti phase to the qah phase through the @xmath0-broken ti and metallic phases .",
    "the occurrence of the metallic phase has not been predicted previously  e.g.  for graphene@xcite or bi@xmath7se@xmath8.@xcite it emerges due to an overlap in energy of bands with opposite spin character in the vicinity of the @xmath46-point ( cf .",
    "2(c ) ) , which is characteristic of a material with a non - monotonous dispersion of the bands on both sides of the @xmath46-point .",
    "such a metallic phase can not be achieved  e.g.  for pure dirac bands , which have a local maximum ( minimum ) at the high symmetry ( in this case ) @xmath46-point , as is evident from fig .",
    "our transport calculations according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) show that a finite ahc develops in the metallic and qah phases , see fig .  2 .",
    "microscopically , the non - vanishing ahc can be traced back to the development of the singular berry curvature in @xmath14 space as the @xmath40-field is increased , see fig .",
    "2(g)-(j ) . for @xmath40",
    "below 0.31  ev the berry curvature has a non - trivial distribution in the bz with the regions of positive and negative values , comparatively small in magnitude ( fig .",
    "2(g ) ) , while the bz integral of the berry curvature amounts to zero .    at the onset of the metallic phase",
    "there is a noticeable hybridization between the conduction and valence bands of opposite spin , which gives rise to a very large negative contribution to the berry curvature around the points in the bz at the fermi level ( @xmath60 ) where the orbital character and the spin character of the valence and conduction bands is changing , or , in terminology of ref .",
    "[ ] , along a `` hot loop '' in the bz , fig .",
    "2(c)-(e ) and ( h)-(j ) .",
    "in such a situation , the berry curvature and the ahc , proportional to the integrated value of the berry curvature over the bz , are dominated by the spin - flip transitions mediated by the non - spin - conserving part of the spin - orbit interaction.@xcite at the @xmath46-point , the sign of the berry curvature reverses for @xmath61  ev , accompanying the switch in parity of valence and conduction bands .    in the metallic phase , the ahc as a function of @xmath40 is monotonously increasing ( fig .  1 ) , while the radius of the hot loop is increasing owing to the shift of the hybridization point between the valence and conductance bands away from @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "when the gap is reopened for @xmath62 ev , the ahc reaches a value of @xmath63 , with the chern number @xmath64 , see fig .  2 .",
    "in the qah phase , we observe from our calculations that out of six valence bands , the topmost two bands dominate the contribution to the ahc for exchange fields up to 0.60 ev .",
    "when the exchange field is increased further , deeper spin - up bands will be pushed closer to the fermi energy and take the spin - down character derived from the conduction bands ( cf .",

    "six of them are located on each side of the ribbon , while out of these six there are three `` spin - up '' left - movers and three `` spin - down '' right - movers .",

    "a close inspection of the edge bands in the case of the trb ti phase , fig .",
    "2(l ) reveals that the edge states do not connect the valence and conduction bands in the system , as in the case of the edge states of a conventional ti ,  c.f .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian of the system can be transformed such that the spectrum at the edges exhibits a gap at the fermi energy .",
    "moreover , owing to the breaking of the @xmath0-symmetry , back - scattering is in general allowed which results in the dissipative transport properties of the edge states.@xcite noticeably , in the qahe phase , fig .  2(n , o )",
    "the connection of the valence and conduction bands of the bilayer via the edge states is restored again , resulting in a dissipationless longitudinal transport of the ribbon , realized by the topologically protected edge states .    of particular interest here",
    "is the spatial distribution of the spin - polarization of the edge states around the fermi energy , @xmath67 , which plays a very important role in spin - polarized scanning - tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) experiments.@xcite we calculate this spin polarization as a function of the @xmath40-field in real space across the ribbon , and present the results in fig .  4 .",
    "let us consider first the case of a very small exchange field @xmath68  ev and look at the spin - polarization at @xmath60 across the ribbon ( fig .",
    "we observe that the spin polarization is : ( i ) rather localized at the edges of the ribbon , ( ii ) reaches very large values , ( iii ) displays oscillations in sign across the ribbon .",
    "these properties can be understood by referring to the electronic structure of the edge states for this value of the field , which is quite similar to that depicted in fig .",
    "2(l ) , only with the smaller separation between the upper ( predominantly spin - up ) and lower ( predominantly spin - down ) subgroups of two edge states , so that there are twelve states at @xmath60 all together .",
    "the direction and spin character of the edge states at @xmath60 is sketched in fig .",
    "we observe that owing to the presence of the non - zero exchange field and breaking of @xmath0 symmetry , the edge - states get spin - polarized , while on each side of the ribbon the number of right and left movers is equal for @xmath69 .",
    "this results in zero transverse charge conductance , in accordance to the phase diagram , fig .  1",
    ".    for larger wavevectors @xmath70 , see fig .",
    "2(l ) , the upper group of two states has a strong spin - up character , and for @xmath68  ev ( not shown ) it crosses the fermi energy , giving rise to a strong spin - polarization in the direction of the @xmath40-field . since the states with larger @xmath71 ( away from the bulk bands ) are more localized at the edges of the ribbon than the states with smaller @xmath71 ( closer to the bulk bands),@xcite positive @xmath67 in fig .  4 for this field",
    "is localized at the ribbon edges .",
    "correspondingly , the states at @xmath60 close to @xmath46 are the source of negative spin polarization , which is smeared more across the ribbon owing to stronger hybridization with the bulk states , thus giving rise to the change in the sign of @xmath67 away from the ribbon edges .",
    "we speculate that such oscillatory spatial dependence of @xmath67 should be a common phenomenon in a situation where the electronic structure of the edge states of a 2d ti exposed to an exchange field is non - trivial .",
    "the spatial distribution of the @xmath67 in the unit cell for this case is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "4 .    increasing",
    "the exchange field further pushes the tail of long wave length spin - up edge states out of the bulk gap completely around @xmath51 ev , fig .",
    "in this case , there are only 8 edge states left , whose direction of the spin - polarization at the fermi energy is opposite to the direction of the @xmath40-field .",
    "since the bi(111 ) bilayer exhibits a @xmath0-broken ti phase for this value of @xmath40 , there are two left and two right movers on each side of the ribbon , with zero transported charge , fig .  4 .",
    "in correspondence to the predominantly spin - down character of the edge states in @xmath14 space , the @xmath67 is large and negative in the vicinity of the edge of the ribbon .",
    "noticeably , the spin polarization decays much slower with the distance towards the center of the ribbon , when compared to the case considered previously , owing to the proximity of the edge states in @xmath14 space to the bulk states .",
    "we remark here that the predicted change in sign of @xmath67 is an interesting phenomenon , which can be exploited experimentally  e.g.  via tuning the strength of the exchange field by deposition of different adatoms@xcite ( see also comments in section v ) .",
    "the evolution of the edge states for @xmath72 ev can be seen in fig .",
    "2(l)-(o ) . as the exchange field",
    "is increased , the magnitude of @xmath67 gradually decreases , since the conduction and valence bands become very close in energy , and the @xmath73 vectors of the edge states approach the @xmath46 point .",
    "this is particularly clear for the edge states in the qah phase at @xmath74  ev , for which @xmath67 and its decay rate into the ribbon are very small , fig .",
    "4 . for the regime of @xmath40 in between 0.42 and 0.7",
    "ev ,  i.e. ,  at the onset of the qah phase , the number of edge states is the same as that in the @xmath0-broken ti phase at @xmath51  ev , but the emergent quantized charge conductance of the edge states proportional to @xmath59 on each side of the ribbon is evident , fig .",
    "when @xmath75 ev four more edge states are pushed out of the bulk gap window , and only four edge states crossing @xmath60 are left overall . in this case , we have a situation of two right / left movers on each side of the ribbon , with a small positive spin polarization , fig .  4 . the microscopic mechanism for spin - polarized electron conduction in these edge states without possibility to back - scatter remains and open and interesting topic for future studies .",
    "in this work , based on first principles calculations , we have considered the emerging topological phases of bi(111 ) bilayer in an external exchange field @xmath40 . we identify four different phases as the exchange field",
    "is varied : ti phase for @xmath41 , @xmath0-broken ti phase for small fields , metallic phase for intermediate fields , and chern insulator , or , qah phase for large exchange fields .",
    "we consistently identify each of the insulating phases in terms of the chern number @xmath59 , spin chern number @xmath6 , spin and charge transverse conductivity .",
    "we attribute the origin of phase transitions to the spin - orbit mediated spin - mixing between valence and conduction bands whose topology in @xmath14 space is controlled by the applied field .",
    "in particular , we focus on the electronic structure and development of the edge states in a zigzag ribbon of bi(111 ) bilayer as a function of the @xmath40-field .",
    "we show that the spin polarization of the edge states along the direction of the exchange field at the fermi level can be significant in magnitude , and its sign , as well as its spatial distribution can be controlled by changing the magnitude of the applied field . since reversing the direction of the exchange field leads to reversed propagation direction and reversed spin polarization of the edge states , the exchange field provides a tool to tune the properties of one - dimensional spin - polarized transport arising at the edges of insulators with non - trivial topological properties .",
    "we also speculate that the spin polarization of the edge states , which characterizes different topological phases , can be observed in  e.g.  scanning tunneling microscopy experiments .",
    "we remark that the experimental realization of the tunable exchange field applied to a thin bi(111 ) bilayer can be sought in two directions .",
    "one way lies in finding a suitable insulating substrate for deposition of bi(111 ) which exhibits essential magnetism at least at the interface with the bilayer . in this case",
    "the direction of the @xmath40-field can be easily ( depending on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ) reversed , while the magnitude of the exchange field can be tuned via  e.g.  the magnetoelectic effect if the substrate used for deposition has multiferroic properties .",
    "second route lies in deposition of transition metal adatoms on the bi(111 ) surface .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated theoretically that such adatom deposition can induce considerable exchange splitting with magnitude as large as several tenth of ev on the topological insulator underneath,@xcite and for bi@xmath7se@xmath8 , the exchange field is large enough to get the system into the qah phase.@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the exchange field in this case can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the transition metal , or by deposition of the system on an insulating non - magnetic substrate , which can cause essential modifications in the distance between the ti and deposited adatoms .",
    "we also note , that , generally speaking , the magnitude of the exchange field necessary to achieve the qah phase in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 depends directly on the initial value of the gap in the ti phase without the field .",
