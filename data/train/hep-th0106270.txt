    "the ising model has long been a subject of great interest .",
    "the computation of the free energy @xcite and spontaneous magnetization @xcite , toeplitz determinant representations @xcite , form factor expansions @xcite and nonlinear differential equations @xcite for the correlation functions are among the most important advances of the modern mathematical physics . the partition function of the 2d ising model in zero field was calculated exactly @xcite not only in the thermodynamic limit but also for finite lattices with different boundary conditions .",
    "the simplicity of the corresponding expressions enables one to get an idea about the mechanism of appearance of critical singularities in thermodynamic quantities from both mathematical and physical points of view .",
    "analytical expressions for thermodynamic quantities , which contain the dependence on lattice size , have numerous applications .",
    "for example , in computer simulation of thermodynamic systems or quantum field models one often needs such expressions to estimate the number of degrees of freedom for which a discrete numerical model is adequate to the initial continuous and infinite system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that modern experiments and technologies often deal with finite - size systems",
    ". theoretical analysis of such systems experiences the lack of exactly solvable examples .    in this paper",
    "we present exact expressions for the 2-point correlation function and the susceptibility of the 2d ising model on a lattice with one finite ( @xmath2 ) and the other infinite ( @xmath3 ) dimension .",
    "these expressions are very similar to well - known form factor expansions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we investigate the singularity structure of the susceptibility for finite values of @xmath0 and discuss the thermodynamic limit @xmath4 .",
    "the ising model on @xmath6 square lattice ( fig .",
    "1 )        is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath7 $ ] @xmath8=-j\\sum_{{{\\mathbf { r}}}}\\sigma({{\\mathbf { r } } } ) ( \\nabla_x+\\nabla_y)\\sigma({{\\mathbf { r}}}),\\ ] ] where the two - dimensional vector @xmath9 labels the lattice sites : @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; the ising spin @xmath12 in each site takes on the values @xmath13 ; the parameter @xmath14 defines the energy of the coupling of adjacent spins .",
    "shift operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 act as follows : @xmath17 partition function at the temperature @xmath18 @xmath19}{{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\beta h[\\sigma]},\\ ] ] and 2-point correlation function @xmath20}{{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\beta h[\\sigma]}\\sigma({{\\mathbf { r}}}_1)\\sigma({{\\mathbf { r}}}_2)\\ ] ] are given by the sums over all possible spin configurations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath21    we will impose periodic boundary conditions on both axes .",
    "this gives two equations for the shift operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 : @xmath22 for such boundary conditions the partition function ( [ 2.3 ] ) can be written as a sum of four terms @xcite : @xmath23 each of them is given by the pfaffian of the operator @xmath24 ( a lattice analogue of the dirac operator ) @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 the upper indices @xmath27 of the quantities @xmath28 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) correspond to different types ( antiperiodic or periodic ) of boundary conditions for the operators @xmath29 in ( [ 2.9 ] ) : @xmath30 when , for example , @xmath31 ( i.e. the torus transforms into a cylinder ) , then in the right hand side of ( [ 2.7 ] ) only the `` antiperiodic '' term survives : @xmath32 since the operator @xmath24 is translationally invariant , the pfaffian ( [ 2.8 ] ) can be easily computed . using fourier transformation ,",
    "one finds the following factorized representation for the partition function ( [ 2.11 ] ) : @xmath33 the superscript @xmath34 in the products ( or sums below ) implies that the quasimomentum components @xmath35 and @xmath36 run in the brillouin zone over half - integer values in the units @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ; integer values correspond to the superscript @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xmath40 the product over one of the quasimomentum components in the right hand side of ( [ 2.12 ] ) can be calculated in an explicit form , so that for the partition function one has @xmath41 where the function @xmath42 is the positive root of the equation @xmath43 and the parameter @xmath44 is the following function of @xmath45 : @xmath46 for @xmath47 @xmath42 remains positive in the whole range of the parameter @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) , but @xmath49 changes its sign after crossing the critical point @xmath50 . since the product in ( [ 2.14 ] ) is taken over fermionic spectrum , which does not contain the value @xmath51 , this does not cause any problem there .",
    "however , we will see that the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath52 leads to two different representations for the correlation function .",
    "the sum over spin configurations in the right hand side of the expression ( [ 2.4 ] ) for the correlation function can also be written in terms of pfaffians @xcite .",
    "corresponding matrices , however , are not translationally invariant .",
    "this fact drastically complicates the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the computation of the correlation function can be reduced to the computation of the determinant of a matrix @xmath53 of considerably smaller size @xmath54 , defined by the distance between correlating spins .",
    "further work is needed to transform the representation ( [ 2.17 ] ) into a representation with analytic dependence on the distance .",
    "form factor representation for the correlation function of the ising model is the most acceptable from physical point of view .",
    "first it was obtained in @xcite for the infinite lattice in the ferromagnetic region ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "later it was extended @xcite to the paramagnetic case ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "we note that somewhat earlier a similar representation for the 2-point green function was deduced in @xcite via @xmath59-matrix approach @xcite for a quantum field theory model with factorized @xmath59-matrix ( @xmath60 ) , which is usually associated with the scaling limit of the ising model .",
    "the discovery of the form factor representation for the correlation function has led to the whole trend @xcite in the integrable quantum field theory .    for the finite lattice",
    "the problem seems to be more difficult , but the result @xcite is , in a sense , even simpler .",
    "if correlating spins are located along one of the lattice axes , the matrix in the right hand side of ( [ 2.17 ] ) has toeplitz form .",
    "for example , when correlating spins are located along the horizontal axis ( fig .",

    "the expressions ( [ 2.20 ] ) , ( [ 2.21 ] ) are finite sums .",
    "however , the upper limits of summation can be set infinite , since it follows from ( [ 2.23 ] ) that the form factor @xmath68 $ ] vanishes for @xmath69 .",
    "note an important detail  the summation over the phase volume in ( [ 2.22 ] ) is taken over bosonic spectrum of quasimomenta , in contrast with the initial fermionic spectrum , which determines the matrix ( [ 2.19 ] ) .",
    "the other quantities in ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) are given by @xmath70    `` cylindrical parameters '' @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 explicitly depend on the number of sites @xmath0 on the base of the cylinder .",
    "their asymptotic behaviour for @xmath74 is the following : @xmath75 thus outside the critical point cylindrical parameters @xmath72 , @xmath76 and @xmath73 exponentially decrease for large @xmath0 and tend to zero for infinite lattice . finite sums ( [ 2.20 ] ) , ( [ 2.21 ] ) transform into series , summation over the phase volume in ( [ 2.22 ] ) is substituted by integration and , as a result , form factor representations on the cylinder transform into form factor representations on the infinite lattice @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for any finite @xmath0 both expansions  over even @xmath77 ( [ 2.20 ] ) and over odd @xmath77 ( [ 2.21 ] )  are valid in both ferromagnetic @xmath78 and paramagnetic @xmath79 regions . however , for @xmath80 , the first series is well - defined and converges in the ferromagnetic region and the second one does so in the paramagnetic region .    recall that we started from the determinant ( [ 2.18 ] ) of a @xmath62 matrix .",
    "the number of terms in its formal definition rapidly increases when @xmath81 grows .",
    "however , the form factor representations ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) are finite sums for any fixed @xmath0 , and the number of terms in these sums does not depend on @xmath82 .",
    "this gives a unique opportunity to verify ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) by comparing these representations with the results of transfer matrix calculations for @xmath0-row ising chains . for fixed @xmath0",
    "the dimension of the corresponding transfer matrix is equal to @xmath83 .",
    "one can find analytically all eigenvectors and eigenvalues if @xmath0 is not too large .",
    "we have successfully performed such check analytically for @xmath84 and numerically  for @xmath85 .",
    "the rigorous derivation of the form factor representation on the cylinder was performed in @xcite only for the spins located along the cylinder axis .",
    "we have not yet succeeded in generalization of the method for arbitrary disposition of correlating spins ( fig .",
    "meanwhile , the calculation of the momentum representation of correlation function @xmath87 or the susceptibility ( which is related to @xmath88 ) requires an explicit dependence on both components of the vector @xmath89 .",
    "form factor representations  ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) have a transparent physical content .",
    "this allows to make reasonable assumptions for corresponding generalizations .",
    "the above mentioned possibility of independent check allows to eliminate wrong hypotheses and to make correct choice . in principle , when @xmath90-component of the vector @xmath89 is not equal to zero , all quantities in ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) could change their form .",
    "however , corresponding expressions for free bosons and fermions on the lattice prompt one of the simplest generalizations  just the substitution @xmath91 suprisingly enough , this turns out to be sufficient .",
    "if instead of @xmath92  ( [ 2.22 ] ) one uses the expression @xmath93}}^{(b)}\\prod_{j=1}^n \\left(\\frac{{{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-|x|\\gamma_j - iyq_j-\\eta_j}}{\\sinh\\gamma_j}\\right)f_n^2[q ] , \\quad g_0=1 , \\label{3.3}\\ ] ] then the correlation functions  ( [ 2.20 ] ) and ( [ 2.21 ] ) exactly coincide with the transfer matrix results for @xmath84 in the whole range of the variables @xmath81 , @xmath90 , @xmath94 .",
    "numerical calculations confirm this for @xmath85 as well .",
    "the validity of  ( [ 3.3 ] ) is out of doubts and we hope that the known answer will simplify the problem of its rigorous derivation .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider the example of @xmath95 .",
    "the expansions ( [ 2.20])([2.21 ] ) are very similar to the representation of the correlation function in terms of the transfer matrix eigenvalues @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the largest eigenvalue and the coefficients @xmath98 are given by some bilinear combinations of the components of eigenvectors . to reduce , for example , ( [ 2.21 ] ) to ( [ 3.4 ] ) , we use the following expressions for the cylindrical parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 : @xmath99 one can derive these expressions from ( [ 2.25])([2.27 ] ) by passing to contour integrals in the variable @xmath100 and computing the residues .    for @xmath95 we have from ( [ 3.5])([3.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.24 ] ) @xmath101,\\\\   \\xi\\xi_{t}&=&\\frac   { \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(0)+\\gamma(\\pi/3)}{2 }    \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(\\pi)+\\gamma(2\\pi/3)}{2 }    \\sinh^{2}\\frac{\\gamma(2\\pi/3)+\\gamma(\\pi/3)}{2 } }   { \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(0)+\\gamma(2\\pi/3)}{2 }    \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(\\pi)+\\gamma(\\pi/3)}{2 }    \\sinh\\gamma(\\pi/3)\\sinh\\gamma(2\\pi/3)},\\\\ e^{-\\lambda^{-1}-\\eta(q)}&= &   \\frac   { \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(0)+\\gamma(q)}{2 }    \\sinh^{2}\\frac{\\gamma(2\\pi/3)+\\gamma(q)}{2 } }   { \\sinh\\frac{\\gamma(\\pi)+\\gamma(q)}{2 }    \\sinh^{2}\\frac{\\gamma(\\pi/3)+\\gamma(q)}{2}}.\\label{3.10 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then one finds @xmath102 @xmath103    our @xmath104 transfer matrix has 8 eigenvalues , and some of them are equal .",
    "besides that , some eigenvectors have zero components . as a result ,",
    "the expression for the correlation function ( [ 3.4 ] ) contains only three ( not seven ) independent terms . if we take into account the definition ( [ 2.15 ] ) , ( [ 2.16 ] ) of the function @xmath42 for particular values of quasimomentum @xmath105 , we get an exact correspondence between these three terms and ( [ 3.11])([3.16 ] ) .",

    "is given by the term @xmath136 @xmath137 which exponentially increases with the growth of the size of the cylinder base .",
    "it follows from ( [ 5.9 ] ) that the larger @xmath0  the smaller field @xmath138 is needed to order all spins on the lattice .",

    "therefore , the substitution of @xmath141 by the limiting value of the correlation function ( which equals @xmath142 ) under the ( infinite ) sum in the last step of the limits @xmath143 , @xmath144 requires not only ( [ 5.12 ] ) , but also the existence of the limit @xmath145\\bigr\\}=f(k),\\ ] ] and , moreover , @xmath146 the explicit dependence of the correlation function on the size @xmath0 , namely , the exponential tending of cylindrical parameters to their limiting values ( [ 2.28])([2.30 ] ) , can be viewed as an argument in favor of the equalities ( [ 5.13 ] ) , ( [ 5.14 ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the correlation function at large distances in the ferromagnetic region is mainly determined by the first term in the expansion ( [ 2.20 ] ) .",
    "note that it does not depend on @xmath90-projection of @xmath89 @xmath147 therefore , the distance @xmath148 , for which spins are strongly correlated , rapidly increases ( cf . with ( [ 2.29 ] ) ) with the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "physically it means that for `` ferromagnetic '' temperatures the cylinder is divided into `` domains '' of size @xmath148 with nonzero magnetization , the magnetization of the whole infinite cylinder being equal to zero .",

    "the initial expression ( [ 2.3 ] ) for the partition function of the ising model is a polynomial in @xmath45 , and the solution ( [ 2.12 ] ) is the factorized form of this polynomial .",
    "it provides an example of the mechanism of lee - yang `` zeros '' @xcite , which stipulates the appearance of critical singularities in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the specific heat in the thermodynamic limit acquires a logarithmic divergence @xmath157 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the specific heat is expressed through the same function in both ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions of @xmath45 .",
    "one could think that a similar picture holds for susceptibility .",
    "indeed , the initial expression ( [ 2.4 ] ) for the correlation function for finite @xmath132 and @xmath0 is a ratio of polynomials in @xmath45 .",
    "the formation of the singularities of the partition function , which stands in the denominator , we have just briefly described .",
    "unfortunately , the polynomial in the numerator can not be written in such simple factorized form .",
    "nevertheless , our form factor representation for @xmath3 and finite @xmath0 shows that the correlation function has a finite number of root branchpoints on the circle @xmath154 .",
    "their number is doubled in comparison with the case of partition function , since the expressions ( [ 2.20])([2.23 ] ) , ( [ 3.3 ] ) contain the functions @xmath42 ( [ 2.15 ] ) , corresponding to both bosonic and fermionic values of quasimomentum .",
    "the susceptibility on the cylinder is given by the infinite sum of correlation functions and this can lead to the appearance of additional singularities .",
    "one can show , however , that these singularities do not appear on the first sheet of the appropriate riemann surface .",
    "as an example , let us write down the susceptibility @xmath127 ( [ 5.4 ] ) for @xmath95 , using the expressions ( [ 3.14])([3.16 ] ) and representations ( [ 3.8])([3.10 ] ) for cylindrical parameters @xmath158 the singularities in @xmath45 could appear due to zero denominator in ( [ 6.1 ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen , however , that the corresponding factors @xmath159 for @xmath160 are not equal to zero .",
    "it can also be shown that on the first sheet of riemann surface ( which is determined by the condition of positivity of @xmath42 , treated as functions of @xmath45 , for real @xmath161 ) the arguments of cotangents in ( [ 6.1 ] ) also have non - zero values : these factors appear as the result of summation over coordinate @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the complete set of singularities of the susceptibility is exhausted by the branchpoints contained in the functions @xmath162 ^ 2\\label{6.2}\\ ] ] for each value of quasimomentum @xmath163 the function ( [ 6.2 ] ) has four branchpoints .",
    "if we denote them by @xmath164 , then @xmath165 it is seen from ( [ 6.2 ] ) , that for @xmath166 there exist only two branchpoints @xmath167 .",
    "one can now show that for any fixed @xmath0 the total number of singularities is equal to @xmath168 , and all singularities are located on the unit circle @xmath154 .",
    "we represent the corresponding picture for @xmath95 in the fig .",
    "2 .      we do not discuss the limit @xmath4 , when the singularities on the circle @xmath154 form a dense set .",
