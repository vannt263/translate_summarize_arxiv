    "in the last few years our understanding of small - scale structure at high redshift has increased enormously through the study of the ly-@xmath0 forest , the series of absorption features in the spectra of distant qsos . based in large part upon insights gained from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we now know that the physics governing the ly-@xmath0 forest is relatively simple . at the relevant redshifts the gas making up the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is in photoionization equilibrium , which results in a tight density ",
    "temperature relation for the absorbing material with the neutral hydrogen density proportional to a power of the baryon density .",
    "since pressure forces are sub - dominant , the neutral hydrogen density closely traces the total matter density on the scales relevant to the forest ( @xmath3mpc ) .",
    "the structure in qso absorption thus traces , in a calculable way , slight fluctuations in the matter density of the universe back along the line of sight to the qso , with most of the ly-@xmath0 forest arising from over - densities of a few times the mean density ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    while most attention has focused on the low - order statistics of the ly-@xmath0 forest , the statistical properties of the flux are significantly non - gaussian .",
    "@xcite studied the bispectrum of a large sample of qso ly-@xmath0 flux spectrum .",
    "while their results from observations and simulations and theoretical predictions reasonably agree with each other at large scales , they found the errors on the bispectrum are too large to discriminate between models with different ly-@xmath0 forest distribution based on the bispectrum method .",
    "however , while in general probing high-@xmath4 physics with the bispectrum is complicated , in some special cases patterns of higher order correlations can be visible in the moments of the flux .",
    "one particular pattern is that due to the action of gravity in hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the presence or absence of this pattern provides us with a powerful probe of ` extra ' physical effects , beyond gravity , in the formation of the ly-@xmath0 forest , as first emphasized by zaldarriaga , seljak & hui ( 2001 ; hereafter zsh01 ) .",
    "these authors noted that it was possible to constrain fluctuations in the continuum by appealing to higher order moments of the flux . in this paper",
    "we wish to address another physical effect : scatter in the density - temperature relation induced for example by different thermodynamical histories for the gas , fluctuations in the uv background radiation field or radiative transfer effects .",
    "we shall see that it is possible to put tight constraints on the scatter in the @xmath1 relation by considering the higher order moments of the spectra .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : sim ] we briefly discuss the simulations involved in this work and how we extract `` mock '' ly-@xmath0 spectra .",
    "the statistical method introduced by zsh01 is reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : sta ] .",
    "our main results are presented in  [ sec : sca ] , and we discuss the application to high resolution keck spectra in section  [ sec : app ] . in  [ sec : dis ] we discuss several related issues .",
    "since we are interested in the higher order correlations in the ly-@xmath0 flux which are induced by gravitational processes , we first need a model of gravitational clustering . for this purpose",
    "we use a particle mesh code to follow the evolution of dark matter clustering , including only gravity .",
    "details of the pm simulation can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . given the particles positions and velocities ,",
    "the ly-@xmath0 forest spectrum can be constructed based on the so - called `` fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation '' , in which ly-@xmath0 absorbing gas is assumed to trace the dark matter distribution , and be in a state of photoionization equilibrium with the uv background radiation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . under these assumptions",
    "the gas temperature can be obtained through @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the matter density and @xmath7 the cosmic mean .",
    "the index @xmath8 is expected to vary from near unity right after reionization , to @xmath9 at low-@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will set @xmath10k throughout , but in the next section we will introduce scatter around the values given by eq .",
    "[ eq : rhot ] .",
    "the neutral hydrogen number density , based on our ionization equilibrium assumption , is @xmath11 , with the constant of proportionality dependent on the baryon density , redshift , and hydrogen photoionization rate .",
    "we shall fix it using the observed value of the mean flux ( see below ) . with the gas density , temperature and velocity data ,",
    "the optical depth @xmath12 , at a given velocity @xmath13 is @xmath14 \\label{eq : tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the sum of hubble expansion and peculiar velocity at position @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the doppler parameter . here",
    "@xmath18 is the proton mass , and @xmath19 is the photoionization cross section .",
    "the flux at velocity @xmath13 is then @xmath20 .    for definiteness",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath21 output of a @xmath22 particle and @xmath23 mesh pm simulation in a box of side @xmath24mpc , which gives a simulation resolution of @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "the cosmology simulated was of the @xmath27cdm family , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the density and velocity fields were gaussian smoothed by @xmath31kpc to simulate the effects of gas pressure and @xmath32 spectra , each of @xmath33 pixels , were computed on a regular grid parallel to the box axes .",
    "the normalization constant was fixed to reproduced the mean flux , @xmath34 , observed by @xcite at @xmath21 ( see also appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "to constrain scatter in the temperature density relationship on small scales we adopt the high - order statistical method proposed by zsh01 .",
    "we briefly describe this technique here and refer the reader to their paper and @xcite for details .",
    "we define the relative fluctuation of the flux , @xmath35 , and its fourier transform @xmath36 we bandpass filter @xmath37 with a window function @xmath38 : @xmath39 , taking the window function @xmath38 to be either a square window , @xmath40 or a gaussian window function .",
    "our results are not sensitive to this choice , so in what follows we shall concentrate on the square window .",
    "the filtered field @xmath41 in fourier space is then inverse transformed back into real space to define @xmath42 and this is squared to produce @xmath43 . following the conventions in @xcite ,",
    "we define @xmath44 as the power spectrum of @xmath37 , @xmath45 as the power spectrum of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 as the cross - spectrum between @xmath37 and @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath46 depends quadratically on @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath45 can be related to the flux bispectrum and trispectrum , respectively .",
    "we also introduce the same cross - correlation coefficient @xmath48 to study the effect of large scale density fluctuation on small scale power , defining @xmath49",
    "we model the scatter in the temperature - density relation as log - normal in @xmath45 at fixed @xmath6 , with mean value determined from eq .",
    "[ eq : rhot ] .",
    "we choose the width , @xmath19 , to mimic the results seen in hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "specifically we choose @xmath50 and @xmath51 to study the effect . for comparison , by checking @xmath52 scatter plot",
    ", we find a scatter of @xmath53(0.2 ) is consistent with results from low ( high ) resolution hydrodynamic simulations in @xcite , respectively ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : filter]a shows the power spectrum @xmath44 of our simulation under the assumptions of no scatter , @xmath54 or @xmath51 . at @xmath55 ( scales @xmath56mpc ) ,",
    "scatter in the temperature - density relation adds power .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : filter ] the power spectrum , bispectrum , trispectrum and cross - correlation coefficient from the simulations with a top - hat filter with modes between @xmath57 .",
    "we chose that range to maximize the effect of @xmath1 scatter on @xmath48 .",
    "as pointed out by zsh01 , a positive correlation between the large scale density fluctuations and the power on small scales is induced by gravitational instability . since , within the `` fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation '' ,",
    "the fluctuations in the dark matter distribution are directly traced by fluctuations in the ly-@xmath0 forest , the positive correlation induced by gravitational instability is manifest in the ly-@xmath0 flux . in the ly-@xmath0 forest",
    "the correlation is negative since the flux decreases with increasing density .",
    "we see that our model for scatter in the @xmath1 relation does not change the large scale fluctuations of the ly-@xmath0 flux spectrum ; however , by locally varying the optical depth @xmath12 through eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] , it effectively adds noise at small scales . figure",
    "[ fig : filter]d shows @xmath48 at low-@xmath58 becomes steadily less negative as the scatter is increased .",
    "note also that the bispectrum , tri - spectrum and cross - correlation coefficient go quickly to zero for @xmath59 .",
    "this is because after filtering the highest mode in the squared field , @xmath60 , is @xmath61 , or @xmath62 in this case .",
    "finally , we have investigated the requirements on signal - to - noise and resolution of spectra which would be suitable for measuring @xmath48 on the appropriate scales . by adding gaussian random pixel noise to our mock spectra we found that a @xmath63 approaching 50  100 is required in order not to wash out the small scale signal .",
    "we also notice that the level of scatter is closely related to the simulation resolution .",
    "the flux spectrum is obtained by averaging out fluctuations in simulations cells over the thermal broadening width .",
    "the smaller the cells are , the more cells will be averaging out , and the smaller the fluctuation will be . in our simulation ,",
    "the typical temperature of the igm is @xmath64 k , which corresponds to a size of @xmath65 .",
    "so the flux spectrum in each pixel is roughly averaged over three neighboring cells . to test this effect , we check simulations with two other resolutions that are close to the ones in hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite , which are two and four times higher than the one used in the paper .",
    "we found that there are no significant differences among these cases .",
    "in this section , we study the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath48 with two , high resolution , high @xmath63 quasar spectra , q  1422 + 231 at @xmath66 @xcite and hs  1946 + 7658 at @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "these two quasars were observed with keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) , with a signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "we split the two spectra into a total of 13 separate pieces between ly-@xmath0 and ly-@xmath70 emission to avoid contamination from ly-@xmath70 absorption .",
    "each piece has a comoving length of 60@xmath71 mpc to match our pm simulation .",
    "we calculate @xmath48 among these 13 samples following the method described in section ",
    "[ sec : sta ] , and compare these results against our pm simulation .",
    "we made no attempt to correct for metal lines . in order to account for evolution in the mean flux",
    ", we adjusted each spectral segment to @xmath72 by scaling the implied optical depths as in the simulations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ck ] we show @xmath48 from both keck data and our pm simulation . to study the filter effect , we select three filters : ( a ) : @xmath73 ; ( b ) : @xmath74 ; and ( c ) : @xmath75 . with each filter",
    "we plot the no scatter case ( solid lines ) , scattering with @xmath54 ( dotted lines ) and scattering with @xmath51 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "keck data are labeled as solid circles , with error bars computed from the simulations ( the sample size in the data is too small to give constraints on variances ) .    clearly , with large fluctuations , negative signals present in cases with filter ( a ) & ( b ) , which agrees with simulation quite well .",
    "this is consistent with what zsh01 found in q  1422 + 231 data , and confirms the correlation between the large and small scale fluctuations of the ly-@xmath0 flux spectrum induced by gravitational instability .",
    "also in case ( a ) & ( b ) , there is almost no difference between no - scatter and scatter because their power spectra ( see figure  [ fig : filter]a ) show no difference between @xmath76@xmath77 . at smaller scales ( larger @xmath58 modes )",
    "the scattering increases the power spectrum and starts to differentiate between the scatter and no - scatter cases .",
    "we also find , with filter ( c ) , the @xmath48 from keck data is essentially zero , consistent with @xmath78 scatter in @xmath1 relation case .",
    "though other effects ( such as random noise ) may also drive @xmath48 to zero , increasing the @xmath1 scatter above 20% drives @xmath48 positive , so we can conservatively set an upper limit of @xmath78 on the the scatter in the @xmath1 relation .    in the above we adopted an independent random gaussian - distributed @xmath45 for each pixel .",
    "in reality , however , pixels tend to correlate with neighbor pixels : pixels around a high @xmath45 pixel appear to also have a high temperature and vice versa .",
    "such a correlation among pixels tends to produce a `` correlated '' noise from @xmath1 scatter and enhance the signals in cross - correlation coefficient @xmath48 : the larger the correlated pixel length scale , the stronger the @xmath48 .",
    "so with filter ( c ) , we can ask : what is the largest length scale that pixels can be correlated with each other , without showing a strong signal in @xmath48 that conflicts with the keck data ?",
    "we can parameterize this by adopting a correlation parameter @xmath79 : @xmath80 , while @xmath81 is the temperature of pixel @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the temperature obtained from an independent random draw , and @xmath79 is a number between 0 and 1 : @xmath84 means pixels are independent of each other , while @xmath85 mean the maximum correlation .",
    "we found , for the 20% scatter case , @xmath79 must be smaller than @xmath86  0.5 not to be ruled out by the keck data .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a distance of @xmath87 pixels if we define two pixels correlated at the 1% level as `` correlated '' .",
    "this means , with a 20% scatter , the correlated scale length must be smaller than @xmath88 mpc , or @xmath89 .",
    "the observational evidence for the gravitationally induced correlation , and for small - scale decorrelation , currently rests on two high resolution spectra .",
    "it would obviously be of some interest to improve the analysis presented here and to increase the sample of qso spectra for which the analysis has been performed .",
    "zsh01 showed that gravitational instability , and the assumption of the `` fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation '' , predict a specific correlation between large- and small - scale power in the ly-@xmath0 forest .",
    "they also showed , based on high resolution keck data , that observations were consistent with the correlation predicted by gravity . here",
    "we point out that this observation allows one to limit the deviations from the `` fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation '' and in particular to constrain the fluctuations in the density - temperature relation of the igm .",
    "such fluctuations are expected to arise from varying thermodynamical histories for the gas and from fluctuations in the ultra - violet background radiation field or radiative transfer effects .",
    "we find that these fluctuations must be @xmath90 in @xmath45 at fixed @xmath6 in order to be consistent with high resolution keck data .",
    "our method provides a sensitive way to probe for scatter in the temperature density relation that is expected from the complex physics of the igm and seen in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "persistence of gravitationally induced higher order correlations in the spectra requires that the scatter be no more than twice as large as already seen in hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation .",
    "this limits the role of `` additional '' sources of fluctuations such as an inhomogeneous uv background field or radiative transfer effects . to further strengthen the case",
    "requires this correlation to be computed from more high @xmath63 , high resolution quasar spectra such as could be obtained with keck , magellan , or similar telescopes .",
    "we hope that when more high quality spectra along different lines of sight become available , this method will be a powerful tool to study any `` extra '' physical process , beyond gravity , in the igm .",
