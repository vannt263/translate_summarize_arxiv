    "much attention has been focused on vortices in nature,@xcite especially for the quantized vortex in fermionic superfluid and superconducting systems.@xcite one of the fundamental physical quantities of the quantized vortex is the radius of vortex core .",
    "kramer and pesch@xcite have pointed out theoretically that the radius of vortex core decreases proportionally to the temperature @xmath2 at low temperatures , much stronger than anticipated from the temperature dependence of the coherence length .",
    "this anomalously strong shrinking of the vortex core , the so - called kramer - pesch ( kp ) effect,@xcite occurs when the fermionic spectrum of vortex bound states@xcite crosses the fermi level.@xcite the temperature dependence of the vortex core has been theoretically investigated in the case of superconductors.@xcite the low - temperature limit of the vortex core radius was discussed also for dilute fermi superfluids@xcite and superfluid neutron star matter.@xcite    there are several length scales which characterize the radius of vortex core.@xcite one of them is the coherence length @xmath3 .",
    "the pair potential @xmath4 depressed inside the vortex core is restored at a distance @xmath5 away from the vortex center @xmath6.@xcite however , @xmath3 is almost temperature independent at low temperatures . another length scale",
    "is related to the slope of the pair potential at the vortex center , which is defined as @xmath7 the kp effect means @xmath8 for @xmath9 , while the pair potential @xmath4 is restored at a distance @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) at low temperatures.@xcite since the spatial profiles of the pair potential @xmath4 and the supercurrent density @xmath12 in the vicinity of the vortex center are related with each other through the low - energy vortex bound states , the length @xmath13 scales with the distance @xmath14 at which @xmath15 reaches its maximum value.@xcite therefore , the kp effect gives rise to @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) linear in @xmath2 .",
    "recently , @xmath18sr experiments were performed on the @xmath1-wave superconductor nbse@xmath19 to observe the kp effect.@xcite the experimental data of spin precessions , which correspond to the fourier transformation of the redfield pattern ( the magnetic field distribution ) of a vortex lattice , are fitted by a theoretical formula,@xcite extracting the information on the spatial profile of the supercurrent density @xmath12 around vortices.@xcite while a shrinking vortex core was observed , it was weaker than the theoretical expectation of the kp effect for a clean superconductor .",
    "that is , indeed the observed vortex core radius @xmath20 seemingly shrank linearly in @xmath2 , but was extrapolated towards a finite value in zero - temperature limit , indicating a saturation of the kp core shrinkage at a low temperature .",
    "the measurement of the vortex core radius @xmath20 by @xmath18sr was also performed for ceru@xmath19 with a similar result.@xcite since the kp effect is directly connected with the low - energy vortex bound states , the energy level broadening due to impurities may give rise to a modification of the kp effect,@xcite in particular , a saturation as observed .",
    "impurities exist inevitably in any solid state material , so that such a saturation effect is not unlikely to occur .",
    "even it turns out that a rather small concentration of impurities , leaving the material moderately clean , would have a strong influence as observed in experiments.@xcite    there are several factors which influence the behavior of vortex core radius .",

    "the examination of the temperature dependence of @xmath25 suggests that under certain conditions the chiral @xmath0-wave state shows a more robust kp effect against impurities than an @xmath1-wave state .",
    "this behavior is connected with the compensation of the intrinsic phase structure and the vortex phase winding , if chirality and phase winding are oppositely oriented.@xcite therefore , we argue that chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors might be better candidates for the experimental observation of the kp effect . the chiral @xmath0-wave superconductivity has been proposed for sr@xmath19ruo@xmath24 with rather strong experimental evidence,@xcite and more recently for na@xmath26coo@xmath27h@xmath28o.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 ,",

    "1(a ) , at low temperatures the vortex core radius @xmath22 _ shrinks approximately linearly in @xmath2 with moderate curvature _ and saturates towards a finite value in zero - temperature limit .",
    "this gradual saturation due to impurities is in contrast to a sudden truncation of the kp effect due to the discreteness in the energy spectrum of the low - lying vortex bound states.@xcite in the case of the chiral @xmath0-wave pairing system , as seen in fig .  2 , for the positive vortex ( [ eq : op - pp ] ) the shrinkage of the vortex core radius @xmath22 saturates towards a finite value in zero - temperature limit by impurity scattering , analogous to the @xmath1-wave vortex . for the negative vortex ( [ eq : op - pm ] )",
    ", however , the local restoration of the anderson s theorem inside the vortex core@xcite yields a kp effect little affected by impurity scattering and , as seen in fig .  3 , the vortex core radius @xmath22 _ strongly shrinks linearly in @xmath2 at low temperatures even in the presence of impurities_.    it would naturally be highly desirable to establish the kp effect experimentally beyond the present level .",
    "our analysis shows that impurity scattering which is harmful for the kp effect in conventional superconductors , can under certain condition be harmless in a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor , making this kind of system a good candidate for experimental tests .",
    "on the other hand , we expect that rather weak shrinkings of vortex core observed in nbse@xmath19 ( refs .  ) and ceru@xmath19 ( ref .  )",
    "may be explained partly in terms of the impurity effect , i.e. , the vortex core shrinkage approximately linear in @xmath2 with moderate curvature and its saturation towards a finite value in zero - temperature limit @xmath193fig .",
    "rather large extrapolated values of the vortex core radius at zero temperature observed experimentally might be partly attributed to effects of multiple gaps .",
    "finally , we mention a multi - gap effect on the kp effect .",
    "our preliminary results for @xmath212 in a two - gap model show that a contribution from the fermi surface with a smaller gap to the total supercurrent density @xmath12 around a vortex makes the position @xmath20 , at which @xmath15 has its maximum value , shift outward away from the vortex center @xmath6 , leading to a finite @xmath20 at zero temperature in spite of the clean limit.@xcite our detailed results for the kp effect in a two - gap superconductor will be reported elsewhere .",
    "sr@xmath19ruo@xmath24 ( refs .  ) and nbse@xmath19 ( ref .  ) have multiple bands and may be effectively two - gap superconductors .",
    "mgb@xmath19 is a typical two - gap superconductor.@xcite further investigations on the vortex core shrinkage in terms of the multi - gap effects are left for future experimental and theoretical studies .",
