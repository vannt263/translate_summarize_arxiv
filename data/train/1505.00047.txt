    "_ polynomial chaos _ ( pc ) is a computational spectral method that is used to propagate and quantify uncertainties arising in the modeling of physical systems .",
    "the method originated from the works of wiener  @xcite and cameron and martin  @xcite on the decomposition of functionals in a basis of hermite polynomials of gaussian random variables .",
    "ghanem and spanos  @xcite used such an expansion to solve stochastic equations with random data .",
    "xiu and karniadakis  @xcite introduced _ generalized polynomial chaos _ ( gpc ) involving non - gaussian random parameters .",
    "extensions to arbitrary probability measures followed in the works  @xcite ; see also @xcite for recent theoretical developments and a convergence result for gpc expansions .    _ polynomial chaos expansions _ ( pce )",
    "provide an explicit expression of quantities of interests as functionals of the underlying uncertain parameters and in some situations allow us to perform uncertainty quantifications at a considerably lower computational cost than monte carlo methods .",
    "however , they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and thus typically work efficiently for systems involving low dimensional uncertainties .",
    "a related major drawback appears in the long - term integration of evolution equations . in the presence of random forcing in time ,",
    "the number of stochastic variables in the system increases linearly with time and thus quickly becomes overwhelming .",
    "moreover , standard pce utilize orthogonal polynomials of the initial distribution and as time evolves , the dynamics deviate from the initial data substantially ( e.g. , due to nonlinearities ) and the solution may become poorly represented in the initial basis .",
    "this led the authors in  @xcite to legitimately question the usefulness of ( standard ) pce to address long - term evolution properties of solutions such as intermittent instabilities .",
    "this paper aims to address the aforementioned drawbacks .",
    "we propose a pc - based method that constructs evolving chaos expansions based on polynomials of projections of the time dependent solution and the random forcing .",
    "more precisely , chaos expansions at each iteration are constructed based on the knowledge of the moments of underlying distributions at a given time . in the setting of dynamics satisfying a markov property",
    ", we crucially exploit this feature to introduce projections of the solution at prescribed time steps that allow us to `` forget '' about the past and as a consequence keep the dimension of the random variables fixed and independent of time .",
    "our chaos basis is adapted to the evolving dynamics with the following consequences : ( i ) our expansion retains its optimality for long times ; and ( ii ) the curse of dimensionality is mitigated .",
    "notably , we establish , with appropriate modifications , theoretical convergence analysis which sheds light on our numerical findings .",
    "further , asymptotic analysis for computational complexity will also be discussed .",
    "inspired by examples of  @xcite , we will apply our method to a nonlinear coupled system of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) and its variants .",
    "other iterative methodologies have already been proposed in  @xcite in various contexts of random differential equations ( rdes ) .",
    "the main novelty of our approach is that it allows us to compute long - term solutions of evolution equations with complex stochastic forcing , which here will be a brownian motion but could be generalized to more complex models .",
    "white noise  driven evolution equations have important roles in modeling the small scale effects and certain uncertainties in many applications such as turbulence , filtering , mathematical finance , and stochastic control  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",

    "numerical experiments comparing dgpc to hermite pc and monte carlo simulations are presented in section [ sec : numeric ] .",
    "some conclusions are offered in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we briefly introduce the original pc framework . the notation we follow",
    "can be found in  @xcite .    given a probability space @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a general sample space , @xmath2 is a @xmath3-algebra of subsets and @xmath4 is a probability measure , we consider @xmath5 , the space of real - valued random variables with finite second moments .",
    "let @xmath6 be a countable collection of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) standard gaussian random variables belonging to the probability space , and @xmath7 .",

    "note that the wick polynomials are orthogonal to each other with respect to the measure induced by @xmath14 .",
    "the cameron and martin theorem  @xcite establishes that the wick polynomials form a complete orthonormal basis in @xmath15 .",
    "this means that any functional @xmath16 , can be expanded as @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the sum converges in @xmath18 .",
    "we define @xmath19 as expectation with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the expansion is called polynomial chaos expansion ( pce ) .",
    "we will also use the term hermite pce to emphasize that the expansion utilizes gaussian random variables .",
    "one of the notable features of is that it separates the randomness in @xmath20 such that the coefficients @xmath21 are deterministic and all statistical information is contained in the coefficients . in particular , the first two moments are given by @xmath22 = u_0 $ ] and @xmath23 = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{j } } |u_{\\alpha}|^2 .",
    "$ ] higher order moments may then be computed using either triple products of wick polynomials  @xcite or the hermite product formula  @xcite ; see section [ sec : moments ] .    in numerical computations",
    ", the doubly infinite expansion is truncated so that it becomes a finite expansion @xmath24 where we simply used polynomials up to degree @xmath25 in the variables @xmath26 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the graded lexicographic ordering for multi - indices ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 5.2 ) .    in the context of white noise  driven sdes , the random variables @xmath27 can be obtained by the projection @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a brownian motion on @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 is a complete orthonormal system in @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is comprised of i.i.d .",

    "the simple truncation leads to @xmath41 terms in the approximation .",
    "thus , the computational cost increases rapidly with high dimensionality , which in turn decreases the efficiency of pce .",
    "this is the `` curse of dimensionality '' .",
    "another related major problem of pc is that expansions may converge slowly and even fail to converge for long time evolutions  @xcite .",
    "these problems led to numerous extensions of the hermite pce , which we now briefly discuss .",
    "the paper  @xcite proposed a method called generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) , in which the above random variables @xmath42 have specific , non - gaussian , distributions in the askey family  @xcite .",
    "further generalizations to arbitrary probability measures beyond the askey family were proposed in  @xcite , where the probability space is decomposed into multiple elements and chaos expansions are employed in each subelement .",
    "the approach taken in  @xcite is to use a restart procedure , where the chaos expansion is restarted at different time - steps in order to mitigate the long - term integration issues of chaos expansions .",
    "another generalization toward arbitrary distributions is presented in  @xcite , using only moment information of the involved distribution with a data - driven approach .",
    "our key idea is to adapt the pce to the dynamics of the system . consider for concreteness the following sde : @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a general function of @xmath20 ( and possibly other deterministic or stochastic parameters ) , @xmath29 is a brownian motion , @xmath45 is a constant , and @xmath46 is an initial condition with a prescribed probability density .",
    "we assume that a solution exists and is unique on @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "as the system evolves , a fixed polynomial chaos basis adapted to @xmath46 and @xmath47 may not be optimal to represent the solution @xmath48 for long times .",
    "moreover , the dimension of the representation of @xmath47 increases linearly with time @xmath40 , which renders the pce method computationally intractable even for moderate values of @xmath40 .",
    "we will therefore introduce an increasing sequence of restart times @xmath49 and construct a new pce basis at each @xmath50 based on the solution @xmath51 and all additional random variables that need to be accounted for . a very similar methodology with @xmath52 was considered earlier in  @xcite .",
    "when random forcing is present and satisfies the markov property as in the above example , the restarting strategy allows us to `` forget '' past random variables that are no longer necessary and focus on a significantly smaller subset of random variables that influence the future evolution . as an example of application",
    ", we will show that the restarting strategy allows us to capture the invariant measure of the above sde , when such a measure exists .    to simplify notation",
    ", we present our algorithm on the above scalar sde with @xmath44 a function of @xmath20 , knowing that all results also apply to systems of sdes with minor modifications ; see sections [ sec : higherdim ] and [ sec : numeric ] .",
    "first , we notice that the solution @xmath48 of is a random process depending on the initial condition and the paths of brownian motion up to time @xmath40 : @xmath53 therefore , recalling the expansion for @xmath54 , the solution at time @xmath40 can be seen as a nonlinear functional of @xmath46 and the countably infinite variables @xmath14 .",
    "as previously noticed in  @xcite , the solution @xmath48 can be represented as a linear chaos expansion in terms of the polynomials in itself and therefore , for sufficiently small later times @xmath55 , @xmath56 , the solution @xmath57 can be efficiently captured by low order chaos expansions in @xmath48 everything else being constant .",
    "moreover , the solution @xmath57 on the interval @xmath58 depends on @xmath59}$ ] and not on values of @xmath60 outside of this interval .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of random variables in @xmath14 that need to be accounted for .",
    "this crucial observation clearly hinges upon the markovian property of the dynamics .",
    "hence , dividing the time horizon into small pieces and iteratively employing pce offer a possible way to alleviate both curse of dimensionality and long - term integration problems .",

    "the idea is then to employ polynomial chaos expansion in each subinterval and restart the approximation depending on the distributions of both @xmath63 and @xmath51 at each @xmath50 , @xmath64 ; see figure [ fig : prop_chaos ] . here",

    "we utilize the term @xmath66 to represent orthonormal chaos basis involving its arguments . in order to establish evolution equations for chaos basis @xmath67 , triple products @xmath68",
    "$ ] are needed .",
    "this procedure basically corresponds to computing the coefficients and indices in the hermite product formula .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath51 does not belong to any classical family such as the askey family in general .",
    "the construction of the orthogonal polynomials in @xmath51 is therefore fairly involved computationally and is based on the general pce results mentioned earlier in the section . at each time step , we compute the moments of @xmath51 using its previously obtained chaos representation and incorporate them in a modified gram  schmidt method .",
    "this is a computationally expensive step .",
    "armed with the orthogonal basis , we then compute the triple products in @xmath51 to perform the necessary galerkin projections onto spaces spanned by this orthogonal basis and thus obtain evolution equations for the deterministic expansion coefficients . letting @xmath69 ,",

    "we then perform a high order time integration .",
    "cumulants of the resulting solution are then computed to obtain relevant statistical information about the underlying distribution",
    ".    the proposed methodology does not require the computation of any probability density function ( pdf ) and rather depends only on its moments at each restart time .",
    "the statistical information contained in such moments provides useful data for decision making in modeling and , for determinate distributions , moments characterize the distribution uniquely .",
    "this aspect will be essential in the proof of convergence in section [ sec : conv ] .    comparing our method with probability distribution function methods , e.g. , the fokker ",

    "we also stress an important difference between our approach and  @xcite : our scheme solely depends on the statistical information , i.e. , moments , which are available through chaos expansion , whereas  @xcite either requires the pdf of @xmath74 at @xmath50 or uses mappings to transform @xmath74 back to the original input random variables , which in our problem is high dimensional , including the @xmath42 variables .",
    "we now describe the implementation of our algorithm .",

    "however , they quickly lose their accuracy as time grows .",
    "this is consistent with the simulations presented in  @xcite .",
    "the second row of the same figure shows that the accuracy is vastly improved in dgpc using @xmath441 , and second order statistics are accurate up to three or four digits .",
    "moreover , errors in the variance oscillate around @xmath442 for @xmath443 throughout the time length suggesting that the approximation retains its accuracy in the long term , which is consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "our algorithm easily outperforms standard pce in capturing the long - time behavior of the nonlinear coupled system in this scenario .",
    "+    for this scenario , we consider the system parameters as @xmath444 , @xmath433 , @xmath445 , @xmath446,@xmath447 , @xmath448 without the deterministic forcing @xmath449 and with the initials @xmath450{90}{$\\models$}}\\ , v_0 = n(0,{\\sigma_v^2/8b_v } ) .",
    "$ ] in this regime , the dynamics of @xmath328 are characterized by unstable bursts of large amplitude  @xcite .",
    "second order statistics obtained by hermite pce and our algorithm are presented in figure [ fig : ex7_2 ] , where the first two parts ( figures [ fig : ex7_1a ] and [ fig : ex7_1b ] ) correspond to hermite pce .",
    "we observe from figure [ fig : ex7_1b ] that the relative errors for standard hermite expansions are unacceptably high . on the other hand , as the degrees of freedom is increased in dgpc , there is a clear pattern of convergence of second order statistics ; see figures [ fig : ex7_2e ] and [ fig : ex7_2f ] .",
    "note , however , that short - time accuracy is better than accuracy for long times .",
    "this behavior may be explained by the onset of intermittency as nonlinear effects kick in after short times .",
    "further , figure [ fig : ex7_2 g ] shows the error behavior of variance at @xmath451 as @xmath25 and @xmath369 vary , and @xmath82 is fixed .",
    "the rate of convergence is consistent with exponential convergence in @xmath25 and @xmath369 as the logarithmic plot is almost linear . for similar convergence behaviors ,",
    "see @xcite .     +     +    finally , in figure [ fig : ex7_3 ] , we present the evolution of the first few cumulants obtained by dgpc , which shows that the system converges to a steady state distribution as time increases .",
    "bivariate cumulants are ordered so that first and second subscripts correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : ex7_3f ] shows kurtosis excess for @xmath452 and clearly indicates that the dynamics of @xmath98 stay gaussian , whereas those of @xmath20 converge to a non - gaussian state .    as a final example , using the same set of parameters of the previous example , we introduce a small perturbation to the second equation and set @xmath453 in .",
    "another choice of perturbation as @xmath454 was considered before in  @xcite . comparing figurs [ fig : ex7_3 ] and [ fig : ex8 ]",
    ", we see that evolutions of higher order cumulants are perturbed in most cases as expected . in this case",
    ", it took a longer transient time to converge to an invariant measure as additional nonlinearity was introduced into the system .",
    "polynomial chaos expansions ( pce ) applied to the simulation of evolution equations suffer from two drawbacks : in the presence of stochastic forcing , the dimension of randomness is too large , and the long - time solution may not be sparsely represented in a fixed pce basis @xcite . in the setting of markovian random forcing , we have proposed a restart method that addresses the two aforementioned drawbacks .",
    "such restarts of the pce , which we called here dynamical generalized polynomial chaos ( dgpc ) , allow us to both to keep the number of random variables small and to obtain a solution that remains reasonably sparse in the evolving basis of orthogonal polynomials , as was done earlier in @xcite .    following @xcite , we applied dgpc to the long - time numerical simulation of various stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . to demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to reach long - time solutions , we computed invariant measures for sdes that admit one and found a very good agreement between dgpc and other standard methods such as monte carlo - based simulations .",
    "we also presented a simple theoretical justification for such a convergence .",
    "the main computational difficulty in dgpc , as in most gpc - based methods , is the estimation of the orthogonal polynomials of evolving arbitrary measures .",
    "our method , as in @xcite , is based on estimating moments of the multivariate distribution of interest and estimating orthogonal polynomials by a gram ",
    "schmidt procedure .",
    "the bottleneck in such estimations is the cost of computing moments .",
    "this is similar to the cost of solving differential equations by pce methods , where moment estimations are also the most costly step .",
    "however , in dgpc , such estimations can not be performed offline .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", we need to ensure that the evolving measures remain _ determinate _ so that their orthogonal polynomials span square integrable functionals . since distributions with compact support are determinate , our theoretical results have been applied in the setting where sde solutions are well approximated by compactly supported distributions . in this connection",
    ", we note that the calculation of orthogonal polynomials from knowledge of moments is an ill - posed problem , which is a serious impediment to gpc methods in general .",
    "extension of the method to larger systems than those considered here , including to systems obtained by solving stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) is challenging .",
    "the method works reasonably well for low dimensional sdes and it needs modifications for larger systems .",
    "however , the general idea remains applicable . to keep the number of uncertain variables in check",
    ", the method has to be coupled with a compression technique such as karhunen ",
    "loeve projection at each restart time .",
    "moreover , sparse truncation techniques further help to reduce costs .",
    "the analysis of extensions of dgpc to larger systems , faster methods to compute orthogonal polynomials , and adaptive restart procedures is the subject of ongoing research .",
