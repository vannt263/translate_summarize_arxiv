    "in what follows by a _ pencil _ @xmath8 we will always mean a _ real polynomial pencil _ of degree @xmath1 homogeneous polynomials in two real variables , i.e. , a real line in @xmath0 identified with the space of all homogeneous degree @xmath1 real polynomials considered up to a constant factor . here",
    "@xmath9 is a projective parameter . in",
    "order to use derivatives it will often be convenient to view homogeneous degree @xmath1 polynomials in two variables as inhomeogeneous polynomials of degree at most @xmath1 in one variable .",
    "any choice of a basis @xmath10 in @xmath11 allows us to consider the real rational function @xmath12 ; a different choice of basis leads to a rational function of the form @xmath13 , which can be viewed as the postcomposition of the rational function @xmath12 with the real linear fractional transformation @xmath14 in the target @xmath15 .",
    "thus all properties of real rational functions which are invariant under real linear fractional transformations in the target space are naturally inherited by real polynomial pencils .",
    "for instance , the graph of a real rational function @xmath12 restricted to @xmath16 defines a finite branched covering @xmath17 .",

    "the most classical notion of genericity for meromorphic functions / pencils requires that the function / pencil under consideration should have the maximal possible number of ( simple ) critical points with all distinct critical values .",
    "we will refer to this notion as _ hurwitz - genericity _ , see  3 .",
    "the classification of hurwitz - generic real rational functions was carried out in details in @xcite .",
    "the violation of hurwitz - genericity essentially occurs for two basic reasons . either several critical points collapse and form a degenerate critical point or some critical values collide but their corresponding critical points are still distinct . in the present paper",
    "we study a weaker notion of genericity than hurwitz - genericity requiring only that all real critical points of the considered real rational functions / pencils stay simple , see definition  [ d1 ] below .",
    "this notion is the natural counterpart of the absence of the collapse of critical points in the realm of real algebraic geometry .",
    "it still keeps some important information about the behavior of real rational functions / pencils and is closely related to the natural analog of the classical discriminant for the grassmannian of two dimensional subspaces .",
    "one more important observation is that the violation of such genericity is detected in the source space instead of the target which is always more difficult . in short , we forbid singularities and do not care about multisingularities .",
    "our notion of genericity allows us in particular to give a complete solution to the following problem .",
    "[ pb1 ] for which pencils @xmath8 is the number of real zeros in this pencil constant , i.e. , when is the number of real solutions ( counted with multiplicities ) of the equation @xmath22 independent of @xmath23 ?",

    "indeed , note that for any fixed @xmath31 the number of real zeros of the equation @xmath22 equals the number of the real intersection points of the rational curve @xmath32 with the line through the origin with slope @xmath33 .",
    "if the number of real intersection points is constant then there should be no real tangent lines to @xmath34 passing through the origin . but the points on @xmath34 where the tangent line to @xmath34 passes through the origin correspond exactly to the real zeros of the wronskian @xmath35 , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "let @xmath6 denote as usual the grassmannian of lines in @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the behavior of the number of real zeros in a pencil @xmath8 is closely related to the properties of real zeros of the wronskian @xmath30 justifies the following definition :    [ d1 ] a real polynomial pencil @xmath8 is called _ generic _ if the wronskian @xmath30 has no multiple real zeros and it is called _ nongeneric _ otherwise .",

    "note that the singularities of any garden occur exactly at the critical points of @xmath56 where @xmath57 attains a real value .",
    "if such a critical point has multiplicity @xmath58 then at that point the garden has a transversal intersection of @xmath59 nonsingular branches with angle @xmath60 between any two neighboring branches . a critical point with real critical value",
    "is called _ simple _ if its multiplicity equals @xmath61 .",
    "a pencil @xmath48 is called _ nonsingular _ if the only critical points of @xmath57 with real critical values are real and simple .",
    "this implies that the only singularities of its garden @xmath47 are transversal intersections of @xmath16 with other branches of @xmath47 .",
    "the garden @xmath47 of a nonsingular pencil @xmath11 will be called _",
    "nonsingular _ as well .",
    "the aforementioned transversal intersections are called the _ vertices _ of the garden .",
    "note that the vertices of @xmath47 correspond exactly to the real zeros of @xmath35 .",
    "we need to describe nonsingular gardens in more details .",
    "a nonsingular garden @xmath47 is the disjoint union of two basic parts @xmath62 , the _ chord part _ @xmath63 and the ( possibly empty ) _ oval part _ @xmath64 .",
    "the chord part @xmath63 is the connected component of @xmath47 containing @xmath16 while the oval part @xmath64 is the complement @xmath65 .",

    "let us fix the standard metric on the image @xmath15 such that the length of @xmath16 equals @xmath68 .",
    "if we choose some basis @xmath10 of the nonsingular pencil @xmath11 under consideration then by using the rational function @xmath69 we can assign an extra piece of information to all elements of the garden @xmath47 .",

    "[ r1 ] note that the image of an edge , chord or oval can cover some interval of @xmath16 several times .",

    "the _ total weight _ of a boundary - weighted garden is the sum of the weights of all boundary components contained in the closed upper hemisphere other than ovals plus twice the weight of all ovals in the closed upper hemisphere .",
    "there is an obvious map @xmath72 from edge - weighted gardens to boundary - weighted gardens obtained by assigning to each boundary component the sum of the weights of the elements contained in this boundary component .",
    "note that the latter sum is either the sum of the weights of all edges and chords if the boundary component contains them , or just the weight of an oval if the boundary component is an oval , see figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "one can easily see that the image under @xmath72 of an edge - weighted garden @xmath70 is invariant under postcompositions of the rational function @xmath12 with real linear fractional transformations .",

    "it is not difficult to see that the equivalence relation introduced in definition  [ d4 ] preserves the total weight and the number of chords of a garden .",
    "we have defined all the notions mentioned in theorem  [ t1 ] and are now ready to prove this theorem .",
    "we start with some generalities about @xmath36 which can be easily extended to linear polynomial families of higher dimensions .",
    "the following important mapping is called the _ wronski map _ , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "we need several additional definitions and constructions .",
    "let us first recall the following classical definition .",
    "[ d6 ] a pencil @xmath48 of degree @xmath1 polynomials is called _ hurwitz - generic _ if the rational function @xmath50 has @xmath37 distinct critical points with distinct critical values and it is called _ hurwitz - nongeneric _ otherwise .",
    "[ r2 ] as we already noted in the introduction , a real rational function of the form @xmath13 may be viewed as the postcomposition of the rational function @xmath12 with the linear fractional transformation @xmath14 in the target @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that the property introduced in definition  [ d6 ] is independent of the choice of basis of the pencil @xmath11 .",
    "[ d7 ] the _ hurwitz discriminant _ is the subset @xmath118 consisting of all hurwitz - nongeneric pencils in the grassmannian of lines in @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , any real hurwitz - generic pencil @xmath11 is generic in the sense of definition  [ d1 ] .",
    "moreover , such a pencil is also nonsingular , i.e. , it has a nonsingular garden @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , any complex critical point together with its complex conjugate form a pair that can not have a real critical value .",
    "this proves the following lemma .",
    "[ l2 ] the grassmann discriminant @xmath36 is always contained in the hurwitz discriminant @xmath119 .",
    "we say that a nonsingular garden is _ directed _ if its edges , chords and ovals are directed in such a way that the boundary of each face becomes a directed cycle .",
    "this means that any given face will lie either to the right of any of its boundary components or to the left of any such component whenever we follow the direction that has been assigned to a boundary component .",
    "the faces that lie to the left of all of their boundary components are called _ positive _ while faces lying to the right of their boundary components are called _",
    "negative_. all neighbors of positive faces are negative and vice versa . obviously , in order to direct a garden it suffices to direct any one of its edges .",
    "therefore , there exist exactly two possible ways of directing a garden and these are opposite to each other in the sense that the one is obtained from the other by reversing the direction of every edge .    by a _ proper ( cyclic ) labeling _ of a directed boundary - weighted garden with @xmath120 vertices ( equivalently , with @xmath121 chords ) we understand the labeling of its vertices by symbols @xmath122 satisfying the following condition : for each boundary component the number of decreases ( downs ) between consecutive labels when we traverse the labels of the vertices in the order prescribed by the component s direction does not exceed the weight of this component .",
    "an _ involution _ of a properly labeled directed boundary - weighted garden is an operation that reverses both its orientation and the ( cyclic ) order of the labels by sending label @xmath85 to label @xmath123 .",
    "given a hurwitz - generic rational function @xmath124 and fixing the orientation of the target @xmath16 one gets the properly directed and labeled boundary - weighted garden @xmath125 of @xmath105 by taking its garden with the induced orientation of all elements and their induced weights together with the cyclic labeling of its vertices coming from the real critical values of @xmath105 .",
    "note that for any other choice of basis of the pencil @xmath96 the resulting garden either coincides with @xmath125 or may be obtained from @xmath125 by an involution .",
    "an equivalent version of the following result was stated and proved by means of rational functions in @xcite .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath119 denote the divisor of all hurwitz - nongeneric pencils .",
    "the connected components in the space @xmath126 of all hurwitz - generic pencils are in @xmath43 correspondence with the set of all properly directed and cyclicly labeled gardens of weight @xmath1 modulo the action of the involution .",
    "recall from lemma  [ l2 ] that the grassmann discriminant @xmath36 and the hurwitz discriminant @xmath119 satisfy @xmath127 . for our further purposes",
    "we need the following description of @xmath119 .",
    "[ t3 ] the hurwitz discriminant @xmath119 is the union of four real discriminants @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath83 and @xmath128 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined in lemma  [ l1 ] and @xmath83 and @xmath128 are two real algebraic hypersurfaces with the same complexification , namely the hypersurface of all coinciding critical values .",
    "more precisely , @xmath83 is the set of all real pencils @xmath96 for which the rational function @xmath56 has two real critical points with coinciding real critical value , while @xmath128 is the set of all real pencils @xmath96 for which the rational function @xmath50 has two complex conjugate critical points with coinciding ( and therefore real ) critical value .",
    "our plan is as follows .",
    "we will show that by crossing @xmath83 one can realize any admissible relabeling of a given cyclicly labeled boundary - weighted garden and that by crossing @xmath128 we can realize any of its admissible morse perestroikas .",
    "these two facts will be easy corollaries of the following statements .",
    "[ t4 ] any edge - weighted garden @xmath129 of total weight @xmath1 is realized by a real rational function of degree @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the set of all real rational functions with a given egde - weighted oriented garden is path - connected .    here by an edge - weighted garden of total weight @xmath1 we understand an abstract embedded @xmath66-invariant `` graph '' containing @xmath16 with vertices only of even multiplicity and possibly containing a number of @xmath66-invariant ovals considered up to a diffeomorphism of the plane .",
    "all edges , chords and ovals of this `` graph '' are equipped with positive weights .",
    "moreover , ovals have integer weights . finally , for any boundary component",
    "the sum of all weights in this component is a positive integer and the sum of the weights of all elements in this `` graph '' equals @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that in theorem  [ t4 ] we _ do not assume _ that @xmath129 is a nonsingular garden and that we actually allow arbitrary complex critical points with real critical values .",
    "the proof is based on ideas similar to those used in the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite and so we will only sketch it here . (",
    "the only major difference compared to @xcite is that we allow singular gardens . )",
    "we want to construct a topological branched covering @xmath130 which is invariant under complex conjugation and whose garden is isomorphic to @xmath129 .",
    "this will prove the realization theorem , since by riemann s uniqueness theorem there exists a unique complex structure on @xmath15 for which this topological covering is holomorphic .",

    "let us show first that by assigning all real critical values and picking an arbitrary map @xmath155 from each space @xmath146 for @xmath156 we can glue together all the @xmath155 s into precisely one half of a unique real rational function from @xmath150 .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that the real critical values determine exactly which parts of the boundary components of @xmath157 and @xmath158 for any two neighboring faces @xmath159 and @xmath160 should be identified ( glued together ) . indeed , by gluing together all the @xmath155 s for all @xmath156 according to this recipe we get a unique map from @xmath161 to @xmath15 .",
    "we may then take the conjugate copy of the latter map and glue the two halves together along @xmath16 into a sphere @xmath15 , thus obtaining a unique final map @xmath162 .",
    "one can easily see that the final map is the topological branched covering that satisfies all the properties required .",
    "it just remains to notice that in order to assign all real critical values for an edge - weighted garden it is necessary and sufficient to assign arbitrarily just one real critical value for each connected component of @xmath129 containing vertices .",
    "the critical values of the remaining vertices in each such component will then be automatically restored from the set of weights of the chords and ovals in the respective component .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem [ t4 ] just notice that the cartesian product of path - connected topological spaces is path - connected .",
    "[ c2 ] any admissible morse perestroika of a given nonsingular boundary - weighted garden is realizable .",
    "any singular garden that occurs while performing an arbitrary generic perestroika contains just two simple complex conjugate critical points with a common real critical value .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ t4 ] that such a garden can be realized by a rational function .",
    "any small generic 1-parameter deformation of this rational function will necessarily produce the required perestroika .",
    "indeed , in any such deformation the imaginary part of the interesting critical value will necessarily change signs while the rest of the garden will topologically stay the same .",

    "the set of all real rational functions realizing such a garden is path - connected .",
    "therefore , the set of real rational functions with a given oriented boundary - weighted garden is actually fibered over a contractible base with isomorphic path - connected fibers .",
    "( note that by lemma  [ ldesc ] the topology of the fiber does not depend on the particular weights of the chords . )",
    "thus the total space of fibration is path - connected .",

    "place its labels arbitrarily on @xmath16 in an order - preserving way , i.e. , assign real critical values to all real critical points .",
    "then one can restore the weights of all the chords and edges of the garden .",
    "these weights will necessarily satisfy system   given above .",
    "having done so for two different labelings and using the fact that the set of rational functions in theorem 5 is path - connected we conclude that we can find a path from the first rational function to the second through rational functions with the same boundary - weighted garden .",

    "in fact , if @xmath179 is an arbitrary complex number and @xmath180 denotes the number of zeros of the polynomial @xmath181 lying in the upper half - plane then the following more general result is known to be true , see @xcite .",

    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , the notion of garden of a real rational function provides a natural topological framework for investigating the hawaii conjecture ( conjecture  [ con1 ] ) .",
