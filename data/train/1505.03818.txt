    "<S> in this approach , the light is relatively intense , so that the electronic structure is represented by eigenvalues of a floquet hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependence of the electric field , rather than intrinsic properties of the material or nanoscale structures , is used to effectively break inversion symmetry and distinguish the valleys . </S>",

    "<S> variations in the intensity and the frequency of the light tune the quasienergy band structure through many distinct topological phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum includes two valleys of states near the @xmath26 and @xmath25 points of the brillouin zone , and wavefunctions are two - component spinors representing the electron amplitudes on the two sublattices of the honeycomb structure . in the presence of a spatially uniform , time - dependent electric field from light normally incident on the graphene plane , </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath33 is set to the @xmath39 point [ @xmath40 , with @xmath8 the nearest neighbor distance ] the lattice symmetry combines with the temporal symmetry so that @xmath41 , effectively tripling the relevant frequency for the floquet problem . because of this , distinct states can cross , rather than repel , at the floquet zone boundary @xmath42 as @xmath43 or @xmath14 are varied , leading to topological transitions in the quasienergy band structure .    </S>",

    "<S> for this @xmath55 the inequality  ( [ eq : sym_break ] ) is satisfied , provided @xmath56 , while the frequency tripling of @xmath53 is retained . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bulk ] , gaps at @xmath39 are in general unequal and can be opened and closed around @xmath28 separately by tuning the optical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note that the phase offset @xmath57 may be adjusted by varying the optical path length of the @xmath2 light component relative to the @xmath14 component . </S>",
    "<S> as we next show numerically , this leads to different band gaps for the two valleys , even allowing the gap to close for one while the other remains open . </S>",
