    "since the first extrasolar planet was discovered in 1995 @xcite , more than 800 exoplanets have been detected as of march 2013 , owing to improvements in both observational instruments and the methods of analysis .",
    "although most known exoplanets are gas giants , estimates based on both theory and observation indicates that terrestrial planets are also common @xcite .",
    "supporting these estimates is the fact that earth - like planets have indeed been discovered .",
    "moreover , space telescopes ( e.g. , _ kepler _ ) have now released observational data about many terrestrial - planet candidates . whether terrestrial planets with liquid water exist is an important question to consider because it lays the groundwork for the consideration of habitability .",
    "the orbital range around a star for which liquid water can exist on a planetary surface is called the habitable zone ( hz ) ( hart 1979 ; kasting et al .",
    "the inner edge of the hz is determined by the runaway greenhouse limit @xcite , and the outer edge is estimated from the effect of co@xmath0 clouds @xcite .",
    "the region between these edges is generally called the hz for terrestrial planets with plentiful liquid water on the surface ( ocean planets ) .",
    "planets with plentiful water on the surface but outside the outer edge of the hz would be globally covered with ice , and no liquid water would exist on the surface .",
    "these are called `` snowball planets '' ( tajika 2008 ) .",
    "moreover , an ocean planet could be ice - covered even within the hz because multiple climate modes are possible , including ice - free , partially ice - covered , and globally ice - covered states @xcite .",
    "although such planets would be globally ice - covered , liquid water could exist beneath the surface - ice shell if sufficient geothermal heat flows up from the planetary interior to melt the interior ice . in this scenario ,",
    "only a few kilometers of ice would form at the surface of the ocean @xcite , and life could exist in the liquid water under the surface - ice shell @xcite .    another possibility is presented by planets that float in space without being gravitationally bound to a star ( free - floating planets ) , as have been found thanks to recent advances in observational techniques @xcite . although such planets receive no energy from a central star , even a free - floating earth - sized planet with considerable geothermal heat could have liquid water under an ice - covered surface",
    ".    considering geothermal heat from the planetary interior , @xcite discusses the theoretical restrictions for ice - covered extrasolar terrestrial planets that , on the timescale of planetary evolution , have an internal ocean .",
    "@xcite shows that an internal ocean can exist if the water abundance and planetary mass are comparable to those of earth .",
    "a planet with a mass less than @xmath2 can not maintain an internal ocean .",
    "for a planet with mass @xmath3 , liquid water would be stable either on the planetary surface or under the ice , regardless of the luminosity of the central star and of the planetary orbit .",
    "these are important conclusions and have important implications for habitable planets .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis of tajika ( 2008 ) and vary the parameter values such as abundance of radiogenic heat sources and h@xmath0o abundance on the surface . although @xcite assumed that the mass ratio of h@xmath0o on the planetary surface is the same as that on earth ( 0.023 wt% ) , the origin of water on the earth is not apparent @xcite so it is possible that extrasolar terrestrial planets have some order of h@xmath0o abundance .",
    "we investigate this possibility by varying the h@xmath0o abundance in our simulation , and also check whether ice appears under h@xmath0o layers under high - pressure conditions ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , in this work , we consider the effect of high - pressure ice under an internal ocean and discuss its implications for habitability ( see section 4.2 ) . with these considerations , we discuss the conditions required for bound and unbound terrestrial planets to have an internal ocean on the timescale of planetary evolution ( owing to geothermal heat flux from the planetary interior ) .",

    "the condition for terrestrial planets to have an internal ocean is @xmath46    to estimate the geothermal heat flux @xmath21 through planetary evolution , we investigate the thermal evolution of terrestrial planets by using a parameterized convection model ( tajika  matsui 1992 ; mcgovern ",
    "schubert 1989 ; franck  bounama 1995 ; von blow et al .",
    "2008 ; see appendix for details ) .",
    "we assume @xmath47 , which is the initial heat generation per unit time and volume , is 0.1@xmath48 to 10@xmath48 , where the constant @xmath48 is the initial heat generation estimated from the present heat flux of the earth ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "ice undergoes a phase transition at high pressure ( fig .",
    "2 ) . unlike ice",
    "i , the other phases are more dense than liquid h@xmath0o .",
    "we call the denser ice `` high - pressure ice . ''",
    "because @xcite assumes that the amount of h@xmath0o on the planetary surface is the same as that on the earth s surface @xmath19 ( @xmath49 ) , the only possible conditions on the planetary surface are those labeled 1 , 2 , and 3 in fig .",
    "3 . however , because we consider herein that h@xmath0o amounts may range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , the h@xmath0o - rock boundary could move to higher pressure , so we should account for the effect of high - pressure ice ( fig .",
    "therefore , types 4 , 5 , and 6 of fig . 3b are added as possible surface conditions .",
    "types-2 and type-5 planets both have an internal ocean , but high - pressure ice exists in type-5 planets between the internal ocean and the underlying rock .",
    "we approximate the melting curve by straight lines connecting the triple points in the linear pressure - temperature phase diagram .",
    "we also assume that the amount of heat flux from the planetary interior that is transferred through the internal ocean by thermal convection is the same as that which is transferred through the surface ice . here",
    ", we presume that temperature gradient in liquid - water part of phase diagram is isothermal ( figs .",
    "3a and 3c ) , although a gradient for a deeper internal ocean than what is considered in this study should be carefully discussed .",
    "the condition for high - pressure ice to exist under the internal ocean is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pressure at the h@xmath0o - rock boundary and @xmath52 is the pressure on the phase diagram where the temperature gradient and the high - pressure melting line cross ( fig .",
    "3c ) . as a representative value",
    ", we assume that high - pressure ice has a density of 1.2 g/@xmath53 . because the characteristic features of high - pressure ice are poorly understood , we simplified the model ; and , in particular , the thermal conductivities of high - pressure ice ( see below ) .",
    "when thermal conductivity of high - pressure ice is relatively high and the temperature gradient in the high - pressure - ice part of the phase diagram is less than the gradient of the melting lines , the layer of high - pressure ice continues to the h@xmath0o - rock boundary [ ( i ) in fig .",
    "however , when the thermal conductivity is comparatively low and the temperature gradient is greater than that of the melting lines , the temperature gradient joins the melting line and goes along with the melting lines to the h@xmath0o - rock boundary [ dashed arrows ( ii ) and ( iii ) in fig .",
    "although little is known about the conditions on the dashed arrows , we assume that layer to be high - pressure ice in this study . therefore , from the point where the temperature - pressure line crosses into the high - pressure - ice part , the high - pressure layer continues to the h@xmath0o - rock boundary .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show the surface conditions for planets with masses from @xmath54 to @xmath55 at 4.6 billion years after planetary formation , with varying h@xmath0o masses on the surface , with initial radiogenic heat sources , and at 1au from our sun .",
    "we assumed @xmath56 for fig . 4a and @xmath57 for fig . 4b .",
    "because larger planets have larger geothermal heat flux and thicker h@xmath0o layers , they could have an internal ocean with less h@xmath0o mass on the planetary surface ( fig .",
    "4a ) and a weaker initial radiogenic heat source ( fig .",
    "4b ) . however , larger planets also have larger gravitational acceleration .",
    "thus , on those planets , high - pressure ice tends to appear under the internal ocean with smaller h@xmath0o mass on the surface ( fig .",
    "4a ) . for example , if a planet of mass of @xmath1 has an h@xmath58o mass of @xmath59 to @xmath60 , it could have an internal ocean .",

    "when the planet has a greater h@xmath0o mass , high - pressure ice could appear under the internal ocean ( fig .",
    "4d ) . here",
    ", the planetary surface temperature seems very low , so we assume that the planet is covered by ice that has a higher albedo ( @xmath270.6 ) than ocean / land ( @xmath270.3 ) .    figures 5a and 5b show the surface conditions for free - floating planets ( @xmath65 ) with masses from @xmath54 to @xmath55 at 4.6 billion years after planetary formation .",
    "the incident flux from the central star affects the surface temperature , thereby affecting the condition on the surface .",

    "the results of fig .",

    "an internal ocean could exist on free - floating planets under certain conditions , but the planetary size and water abundance strongly constrain these conditions ( see fig .",
    "5a ) . for instance , if a free - floating planet has an initial radiogenic heat source greater than @xmath66 , it can have an internal ocean ( fig .",
    "figures 5c and 5d give the temperature gradient of surface - h@xmath0o layers for free - floating planets .",

    "6d ) , an internal ocean without underlying high - pressure ice could exist to only approximately 5 au .",
    "the planetary mass and surface - h@xmath0o mass strongly constrain the conditions under which an extrasolar terrestrial planet far from its central star can have an internal ocean with no underlying high - pressure ice .",
    "we expanded on the models of tajika ( 2008 ) by ( 1 ) invoking the mass - radius relationship [ eq . ( 1 ) ] to consider planetary compression by gravity , ( 2 ) considering the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of ice ih [ eq .",

    "the surface - ice shell is thicker than that considered by tajika ( 2008 ) .",
    "for example , the surface - ice shell considered herein is about 1.1 times thicker at 1 au and about 3.5 to 4.4 times thicker on the free - floating planets ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this increased thickness is due to the use of eq .",
    "( 4 ) to describe the thermal conductivity of ice ih in contrast with tajika ( 2008 ) , where a constant thermal conductivity ( @xmath70 ) was used .",
    "tajika ( 2008 ) treated the abundance of h@xmath0o and heat source elements ( a ratio of mass against a planetary mass ) to be constant , i.e. , @xmath57 ( @xmath19 @xmath9 @xmath20 ) and @xmath56 , although the amounts should vary with a planetary mass , and showed that liquid water would be stable either on the surface or beneath ice for a planet with a mass exceeding @xmath71 , regardless of planetary orbit and luminosity of the central star . in this paper , however , when we consider a planet with parameters @xmath57 and @xmath56 , the results shown in fig .",
    "5 are not consistent with those of tajika ( 2008 ) .",
    "our results indicate that free - floating planets with masses between @xmath54 and @xmath55 could not have liquid water on the planetary surface and also under the ice for planetary parameters of @xmath57 and @xmath56 . as just explained , when using eq .",
    "( 4 ) to describe the thermal conductivity of ice ih , the planetary surface temperature becomes more sensitive to the thickness of the surface - ice layer , which leads to a several - times increase in the thickness of the surface ice .",
    "these results thus differ from those of tajika ( 2008 ) .    in this study , we assume that the high - pressure layer continues to the h@xmath0o - rock boundary from the point where the temperature - pressure line crosses into the high - pressure - ice part ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the results of this paper could depend on this assumption .",
    "when the thermal conductivity of high - pressure ice is comparatively low ( similar to that of ice ih ) , the heat can not be transported through the high - pressure ice effectively , thus the bottom of the high - pressure ice could be thermally unstable and be melted enough to form internal ocean .    the result of the present study indicate that the high - pressure layers under the internal ocean could be from @xmath721 km to @xmath27100 km thick because a super - earth planet with a few wt.% h@xmath0o could have @xmath27100 km - thick high - pressure ice layers . in high - pressure ice that is @xmath27100 km thick ,",
    "it is possible that convective ice layers appear . to estimate whether or not such convection layers arise",

    ". if the planet has significantly more h@xmath0o on the surface , the water layer would be very thick and our model would not apply to that planet . if the planet has significantly less h@xmath0o on the surface , the regassing flux of water would change because of insufficient water on the surface , and the planet s thermal evolution would differ from that of earth . in other words , we consider only those planets that are relatively active geothermally and have an adequate amount of water as earth - like planets . improving our model so that it applies to other types of terrestrial planets",
    "is an important problem that we leave for future work .      for genesis and sustenance of life , we need at least ( 1 ) liquid water and ( 2 ) nutrient salts because these substances are required to synthesize the body of life ( maruyama et al",
    "because nutrient salts are supplied from rocks , it is necessary that liquid water should be in contact with rock to liberate the salts .",
    "a type-5 planet ( fig .",
    "3b ) is thus not likely to be habitable because the internal ocean does not come in contract with rocks .",
    "however , it is possible for a type-2 planet to meet this requirement .",
    "therefore , we presume that only type-2 planets have an internal ocean that is possibly habitable .    therefore , the results of this study indicate that planetary mass and h@xmath0o mass constitute two more conditions to add to the previous conditions for an extrasolar planet to have an internal ocean without high - pressure ice . in other words , these considerations indicate that only a planet with the appropriate planetary mass and h@xmath0o mass can have an internal ocean that is possibly habitable .",
    "however , it is possible that hydrothermal activities within the rocky crust may transfer nutrient salts to the internal ocean through cracks in the high - pressure ice .",
    "large terrestrial planets such as those considered in this study are likely to have areas of high geothermal activity along mid - oceanic ridges and subduction zones as well as large submarine volcanos whose tops might emerge into the internal ocean from the high - pressure ice . furthermore , for planets with thick high - pressure - ice layers ( section 4.1 ) , the convective ice layer could transfer nutrient salts from the rock to the internal ocean . in these cases ,",
    "high - pressure ice might not prevent nutrient flux from the rock floor from reaching the internal ocean .      as shown in figs . 4b and 5b",
    ", an appropriate initial radiogenic heat source is an important factor in determining whether or not a planet has an internal ocean .",
    "because the variation in the amount of initial heat generation in planets throughout space is not known , we assume in this study that the initial heat generation @xmath47 per unit time and volume ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . thus , in order to resolve this issue , the general amount of radiogenic heat sources for extrasolar terrestrial planets should be estimated .",
    "an earth - size planet ( @xmath57 , @xmath56 ) orbiting at 1au around the sun for 4.6 billion years with no greenhouse gases might be globally covered by ice ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in contrast",
    ", earth currently is partially covered with ice but retains liquid water on its surface .",
    "therefore , it is almost certain that greenhouse gases play a major role in keeping the surface warm .",
    "even free - floating , earth - sized planets with atmospheres rich in molecular hydrogen could have liquid water on the surface because geothermal heat from the interior would be retained by the greenhouse - gas effect of h@xmath0 @xcite . by applying this model here ,",
    "we can account for the greenhouse - gas effect for various values of emissivity @xmath37 in eq.(6 ) . in future presentations",
    ", we will thus discuss how greenhouse gases modify the conditions necessary for the development of a terrestrial ocean planet or ice - covered planet with an internal ocean .    in the present study",
    ", we assumed pure h@xmath0o on the planetary surface .",
    "however , even if an extrasolar terrestrial planet has surface h@xmath0o , the h@xmath0o might not be pure because it might contain dissolved nutrient salts such as those found in earth s oceans . in this case , the melting point of the solution would differ from that of pure h@xmath0o .",
    "moreover , the phase diagram would become more complicated , and the properties of h@xmath0o ( e.g. , thermal conductivity ) could be transmuted as a result of the appearance of phases in which h@xmath0o ice contains nutrient salts .",
    "a very important work would thus be to analyze multicomponent water ( e.g. , seawater on earth ) to see what qualitative changes such a modified phase diagram would bring to our results .",
    "consider the examples , europa and ganymede , which are the two satellites of jupiter and are thought to have internal oceans .",
    "ganymede is thought to have high - pressure ice under its internal ocean ( see , e.g. , lupo 1982 ) .",
    "therefore , determining whether the internal oceans of europa and ganymede are suitable for life would be pertinent to the discussion of the habitability of internal oceans with or without high - pressure ice .",
    "in addition , a more circumstantial discussion of the habitability of internal oceans would require considering the redox gradient within the internal ocean [ as exemplified by the discussions of europa ( gaidos et al . 1999 ) ] , and the effects of the riverine flux of nutrient salts ( maruyama et al .",

    "<S> the existence of bound and unbound terrestrial planets with liquid water is an important question , and of particular importance is the question of their habitability . even for a globally ice - covered planet , geothermal heat from the planetary interior may melt the interior ice , creating an internal ocean covered by an ice shell . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we investigate the structures of the surface - h@xmath0o layers of ice - covered planets by considering the effects of ice under high pressure ( high - pressure ice ) . as a fiducial case , @xmath1 planet at 1 au from its central star and with 0.6 to 25 times </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0o mass of earth could have an internal ocean . </S>",
    "<S> we find that high - pressure ice layers may appear between the internal ocean and the rock portion on a planet with an h@xmath0o mass over 25 times that of earth . </S>",
    "<S> the planetary mass and abundance of surface water strongly restrict the conditions under which an extrasolar terrestrial planet may have an internal ocean with no high - pressure ice under the ocean . </S>",
