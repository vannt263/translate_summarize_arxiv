    "in dilute astrophysical plasmas , the mean free path between particle collisions can be much larger than the ion gyroradius . in this circumstance",
    ", the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) which describe the dynamics of the plasma must include anisotropic transport terms for energy and momentum due to near free - streaming motions of particles along magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the parallel thermal conductivity of the electrons is larger than that of the ions by a factor proportional to @xmath1 , whereas the parallel viscosity of the ions is larger than that of the electrons by the same factor .",
    "thus , provided that collisions are still frequent enough to keep the distributions of the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field in equilibrium , the usual equations of mhd must be supplemented with an anistropic electron heat conduction term , and an anisotropic ion viscosity . moreover , since the ratio of ion viscosity to electron heat conduction is proportional to @xmath2 , it is often sufficient to neglect the former , and consider only the effect of anisotropic electron heat conduction . in a rotating system , even a small ion viscosity may be important @xcite .",
    "if the parallel and perpendicular temperature of particles are not in equilibrium , more complex closures are required @xcite .",
    "the implications of anisotropic transport terms on the overall dynamics of dilute astrophysical plasmas is only beginning to be explored @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable results obtained thus far is that the convective stability criterion for a weakly magnetized dilute plasma in which anisotropic electron heat conduction occurs is drastically modified from the usual schwarzschild criteria @xcite . in particular , stratified atmospheres are unstable if they contain a _ temperature _ ( as opposed to _ entropy _ ) profile which is decreasing upward .",
    "there are intriguing analogies between the stability properties of rotationally supported flows ( where a weak magnetic field changes the stability criterion from a gradient of specific entropy to a gradient of angular velocity ) , and the convective stability of stratified atmospheres ( where a weak magnetic field changes the stability criterion from a gradient of entropy to a gradient of temperature ) .",
    "the former is a result of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is a result of anisotropic heat conduction . to emphasize the analogy",
    ", we will refer to this new form of convective instability as the magnetothermal instability ( mti ) .",
    "the mti may have profound implications for the strucuture and dynamics of many astrophysical systems .",
    "in this paper , we use numerical methods to explore the nonlinear evolution and saturation of the mti in two - dimensions .",
    "we adopt an arbitrary vertical profile for a stratified atmosphere in which the entropy increases upward ( and therefore is stable according to the schwarzschild criterion ) , but in which the temperature is decreasing upwards ( and therefore is unstable according to the balbus criterion , @xmath0 ) .",
    "we confirm the linear growth rates predicted by @xcite for dynamically weak magnetic fields , and numerically measure the growth rates for stronger fields .",
    "we follow the evolution of the instability into the nonlinear regime , and show that it results in vigorous convective turbulence and heat transport .",
    "these results may have implications for radially stratified atmospheres in which anisotropic transport may be present , including x - ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies @xcite , atmospheres of strongly magnetized neutron stars , and radiatively inefficient accretion flows @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we describe our numerical methods and initial conditions . in  3 , we compare the computational results to the analytical results of linear theory . in  4 and  5 we present the results from the non - linear regime and saturated states for two different choices of boundary conditions for the temperature at the top and bottom of the computational domain .",
    "finally , in  6 we summarize our results , discuss applications , and describe future work .",
    "the equations of mhd with the addition of the heat flux , @xmath3 , and a vertical gravitational acceleration , @xmath4 are @xmath5 @xmath6 + \\rho\\mathbf{g}=0 , \\label{mhd_momentum}\\ ] ] @xmath7 @xmath8   + \\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{q } + \\rho\\mathbf{g}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0 , \\label{mhd_energy}\\ ] ] where the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the total energy @xmath9 is given as @xmath10 with the internal energy , @xmath11 .",
    "for this paper , we assume @xmath12 throughout .",
    "the heat flux contains contributions both from electron motions ( which are constrained to move primarily along field lines ) and from isotropic transport which may arise due to photons or particle collisions which drive cross field diffusion .",
    "thus , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spitzer coulombic conductivity @xcite , @xmath17 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field , and @xmath18 is the coefficient of isotropic conductivity , ostensibly due to radiation .",
    "we consider both @xmath16 and @xmath18 as free parameters in the problem and will vary both independently .",
    "we now specify a vertical equilibrium state in which we can study the linear modes and nonlinear evolution of the mti .",
    "the first step is to choose an _ ansatz _ for the form of the gravitational field . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the simplest choice of a constant vertical acceleration : @xmath19 .",
    "this form is appropriate for a thin plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "alternative choices in which the gravitational acceleration varies with height would be appropriate for the vertical structure of a thin accretion disk , or the radial structure of a self - gravitating gas sphere .",
    "however , since the mti is a local instability , the evolution of modes with wavelengths much smaller than the scale height , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the adiabatic sound speed , should be independent of the form of @xmath22 .",
    "we will consider other profiles in applications specific to particular astrophysical systems in future work .",
    "we next make the _ ansatz _ that the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with height , while the entropy increases with height .",
    "perhaps the simplest vertical equilibrium state which satisfies this condition is a power law : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic pressure is small compared to the gas pressure ( @xmath27 ) , so that the vertical structure is given by the solution of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "of course , any power - law profile with @xmath28 decreasing with height would do ; however , by choosing a linear profile we guarantee that the vertical gradients are shallow and easier to resolve numerically . to satisfy hydrodynamic stability , we choose @xmath29 in an appropriate system of units .",
    "convective stability places a constraint on the entropy gradient via the schwarzschild criterion , namely , @xmath30 . for our choice of initial conditions convective stability to perturbations",
    "requires , @xmath31 .",
    "setting @xmath32 satisfies the hydrodynamic equilibrium and convective stability constraints .",
    "these constants determine the adiabatic sound speed in the domain to be @xmath33 by using a simulation domain which is small compared to the scale height , @xmath34 , we ensure the sound speed does not vary much from the top to the bottom of the box .",
    "finally , we add a weak horizontal magnetic field so that the domain contains either a zero or net magnetic flux : @xmath35 the alfvn speed becomes @xmath36 for the case of a uniform horizontal field .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is chosen to be small so that tension effects are unimportant in the linear regime , that is typically @xmath38 .",
    "we also investigate the effects of strong fields in suppressing the instability .      if @xmath39 , the heat flux in the initial state is zero because the magnetic field lines are parallel to the isotherms , and it represents an equilibrium .",
    "now imagine a small vertical perturbation that partially aligns the magnetic field with the background temperature gradient , that is @xmath40 .",
    "heat is now able to flow from the hotter to the colder regions , causing them to become buoyant and rise .",
    "this , in turn , causes the magnetic field to become more aligned with the background temperature gradient ; increasing the heat flow .",
    "thus , a growing instability is generated .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the instability is gained by considering the linearized equations of mhd ( eq.[[mhd_continuity]-[mhd_edef ] ] ) with the specification of a heat flux that is purely coulombic .",
    "the details can be found in ( section 4 , * ? ? ?",
    "we introduce the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath41 , @xmath42 the frequency of vertical oscillations in a stably stratified atmosphere .",
    "preserving balbus notation , we also define two useful quantities , @xmath43 using the fourier convention for perturbations , @xmath44 , and in the limit of a weak magnetic field , @xmath45 , the dispersion relation simplifies to the non - dimensionalized form @xmath46    solutions to the dispersion relation are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the lower branches are stable oscillations .",
    "note that in figure 5 of ( balbus 2000 ) the factor of @xmath47 multiplying the second term of equation [ dispersionrelation ] is omitted .",
    "our choice of initial conditions sets the constant @xmath48 . by analysis of the routh - hurwitz criterion ( section 4.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the instability criterion is @xmath49 in the limit of infinitesimal wavenumber , the instability criterion simply requires the temperature and pressure gradients to be in the same direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath50 we will refer to the instability criterion equation ( 18 ) as the balbus criterion .",
    "the instability criterion of the magnetorotational instability @xcite can be written @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the angular velocity .",
    "the similarity between the mri and the mti is self - evident .",
    "strong magnetic fields will stabilize short wavelength perturbations in both instabilities through tension .",
    "this point will be addressed in  [ linearmag ] in more detail .",
    "we follow the mti into the nonlinear regime using the athena mhd code @xcite .",
    "athena is an unsplit godunov method for ideal mhd that utilizes constrained transport to preserve the divergence - free constraint of the magnetic field .",
    "isotropic and anisotropic heat conduction are added to the basic mhd algorithm through operator splitting . by finite differencing the diffusion terms in local field line",
    "coordinates , we are able to keep the ratio of parallel to perpendicular thermal diffusion greater than at least @xmath53 for any orientation of the field with respect to the grid ( and much larger than that when the field is closely aligned with grid ) .",
    "we show in section 3.3 that the level of isotropic conduction added by numerical truncation error has a negligible effect on the linear properties of the mti .",
    "details of the numerical methods used for anisotropic conduction , including tests , are given in the appendix .",
    "all of the simulations presented in this paper are performed on a two dimensional grid , with horizontal and vertical coordinates @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the size of the domain is @xmath56 .",
    "our standard numerical resolution is @xmath57 for single - mode studies and @xmath58 for multi - mode studies , although we have performed resolution studies which span grid resolutions from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . by using a box size which is small compared to the scale height",
    ", we ensure the sound speed varies only slightly from the top to the bottom of the domain . from equation",
    "( 11 ) the average sound speed is @xmath61 , giving a sound crossing time , @xmath62 . for comparison , the typical magnetic field strength in the initial state",
    "is chosen to be @xmath63 , giving an alfvn speed of @xmath64 , and an alfvn crossing time of 100 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal @xmath54-coordinate .",
    "we study the saturation of the mti using two different boundary conditions in the vertical @xmath55-coordinate . in both cases , reflecting boundary conditions are applied to all variables except the internal energy , in which an extrapolation is used so that the pressure gradient balances the gravitational acceleration at the boundary  an important consideration for godunov schemes ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , for the first case , the boundary temperature is set equal to the temperature in the last active computational cell in the grid ; that is a neumann boundary condition is used for the temperature .",
    "we will refer to this boundary condition for the temperature as `` adiabatic boundaries , '' as heat is not exchanged . for the second case ,",
    "the boundary temperature is held fixed at constant values at the upper and lower boundaries ; that is a dirichlet boundary condition is used for the temperature .",
    "this latter case drives a heat flux into and out of the domain",
    ". we will refer to this boundary condition for the temperature as `` conducting boundaries . ''    by periodicity , there can be no net flux of mass , momentum , or energy in the horizontal direction .",
    "however , because we do not enforce @xmath65 on the vertical boundaries explicitly , it is possible through numerical truncation error to have a net flux of mass or momentum through the vertical boundaries .",
    "note we specifically permit a net flux of energy ( heat ) through the vertical boundary . for godunov schemes like athena , in order for the flux difference due to the vertical pressure gradient to exactly balance the gravitational acceleration source term , the gravitational source terms must be incorporated directly into the computation of the fluxes .",
    "this requires substantial modification of the underlying mhd algorithm ; thus , we utilize the much simpler procedure of extrapolating the pressure at the boundary to cancel the source terms .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our method by keeping track of the the conservation of net magnetic flux and momentum in the simulation domain .",
    "the fractional error of these is no more than @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively over thousands of dynamical times .    to seed the mti ,",
    "small amplitude perturbations are added to the vertical velocity . to seed a single mode , a perturbation of the form @xmath68 is used , where @xmath69 is the mode of the perturbation .",
    "note single mode perturbations are not smoothed at the vertical boundaries .",
    "to seed multiple modes , gaussian white noise velocity perturbations which are smoothed in the vertical direction using @xmath70 are used .",
    "the standard perturbation amplitude is @xmath71 , which is much less than either the alfvn or sound speed .",
    "as a test of our numerical algorithms , we have performed a series of simulations using a grid of @xmath57 and single mode perturbations where @xmath72 varies from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and @xmath75 with a perturbation wavelength equal to the horizontal domain size .",
    "the initial conditions contain a uniform horizontal field of uniform amplitude @xmath76 ( net flux ) and an initial velocity perturbation of amplitude @xmath77 .",
    "adiabatic boundary conditions are used on the vertical boundaries .",
    "we measure the linear growth rate in the simulation by extracting the horizontally - averaged amplitude of the velocity perturbation seeded in equation [ singlemode_v ] at different times and applying the relationship , @xmath78 the measured growth rates are plotted as crosses on the dispersion relation for linear modes in the weak field limit shown in figure 1 .",
    "the measured growth rates from the simulations are in excellent agreement with the predictions of linear theory .",
    "given that the brunt - visl frequency and temperature vary vertically over the simulation domain , the initialized abscissa is actually a range , the midpoint of which is plotted . for example , one simulation has a range of @xmath79 $ ] which gives a theoretical growth rate of @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "analysis of the linear phase of the simulation gives a growth rate as @xmath81 $ ] , a relatively small error .",
    "due to the difficulty of defining a systematic error convention for this case , error bars are not shown , and the average values are plotted .",
    "we conclude our numerical algorithms for anistropic conduction accurately capture the mti .      like the mri",
    ", the magnetothermal instability can be stabilized at large @xmath82 by tension .",
    "equation [ mti_instability_criterion1 ] shows the dependence of the mti instability criterion on the magnetic field ( implicitly through the alfvn velocity ) .",
    "we define a stability parameter , @xmath83 , as @xmath84 where the maximum growth rate , @xmath85 , is given by @xmath86    figure 2 shows the effect of varying the magnetic field on the growth rate holding all other parameters fixed .",
    "we vary @xmath87 from @xmath88 to 0.03 while the conductivity is held fixed at @xmath89 and @xmath39 .",
    "all other parameters are the same as specified in the previous section .",
    "as the magnetic field ( and stability parameter ) approach zero , the growth rate asymptotes to its maximum value given by the weak field dispersion relation , equation [ dispersionrelation ] . as the magnetic field increases in strength the growth rate decreases until @xmath90 , at which point the instability is entirely quenched .",
    "the curve in figure 2 is approximated roughly by the fit @xmath91      isotropic conduction can damp the linear growth rates of the mti , thus limiting its effect to regions where anisotropic conduction dominates . the anisotropy factor , @xmath92 , is defined as @xmath93 equation [ dispersionrelation ] can be easily rewritten in terms of @xmath92 as @xmath94    to study the effect of isotropic conduction , we hold the total value of the conductivity , @xmath95 fixed . alternatively , this can be understood as choosing a fixed non - dimensionalized wavenumber in the dispersion relation .",
    "we then vary the anisotropy factor , @xmath92 .",
    "this linear study uses conducting boundary conditions at a resolution of @xmath96 .",
    "initial conditions are a magnetic field of @xmath97 yielding a net magnetic flux and a single - mode perturbation .",
    "figure 3 shows the effect of isotropic conductivity on the growth rate for a fixed @xmath98 .",
    "the solid line in this plot comes from the solution of equation [ dispersionrelation ] .",
    "as the conduction becomes purely anisotropic , the growth rate asymptotically approaches the weak - field value calculated previously .",
    "when isotropic conduction dominates , the instability is totally suppressed .",
    "the measured growth rates are slightly over - estimated compared to linear theory for @xmath99 .",
    "if one examines the value @xmath100 , weak - field theory predicts a finite growth - rate ; however , the simulation shows zero growth . in this case",
    ", the two terms of equation [ mti_instability_criterion1 ] are of similar order and the weak - field treatment breaks down .    an important result to note",
    "is that a small amount of isotropic conduction , @xmath101 , does not change the growth rate significantly from no isotropic conduction , @xmath102 .",
    "this fact implies that the anisotropic conduction routine does not need to preserve anisotropy to as many orders of magnitude as is needed for tokamak plasma simulations .",
    "we show in the appendix that our algorithm results in a ratio of parallel to perpendicular conductivity of @xmath103 for arbitrary orientations of the field with respect to the grid .",
    "thus , even though the effective @xmath92 in our simulations is not as close to one as in a real plasma , it is close enough , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath104 , that the resulting dynamics should be unaffected .",
    "table 1 is a list of all runs using adiabatic boundary conditions discussed in this paper .",
    "n1-n2 are characteristic non - linear studies whose properties are displayed in this paper .",
    "runs a1-a5 explore the effect of initial magnetic field strength on saturation .",
    "of course , many more combinations of these parameters can and have been simulated .",
    "an illustrative subset is presented here .      as a fiducial model",
    ", we consider a single - mode perturbation with a purely anisotropic conductivity @xmath105 and a uniform magnetic field strength @xmath87 of @xmath106 labeled run n1 in table 1 .",
    "figure 4 shows plots of the magnetic field lines at various times .",
    "the upper right plot shows the imprint of the sinusoidal perturbation on the magnetic field quite well .",
    "the lower left plot shows the significant non - linear structure that has evolved .",
    "finally , the lower right plot shows the field lines as they execute damped oscillation to a stable , albeit complicated , saturated state .",
    "this case has an initial total magnetic flux threading the domain , so the magnetic field strength does not decrease with time , and the magnetic flux remains constant to round - off error .",
    "figure 5 displays the components of the magnetic field energy , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and of the kinetic energy density , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , averaged over the computational domain .",
    "the magnetic energy associated with the horizontal component of the field is amplified from the initial field strength and a vertical magnetic field is created  both reaching a steady state value .",
    "the kinetic energy initially increases but asymptotes to zero , as the motion is only facilitating the rearrangement of the global thermodynamic gradients .",
    "the time is non - dimensionalized by the average adiabatic sound crossing time of the domain which is @xmath111 . for reference ,",
    "the average alfvn crossing time for these parameters , @xmath112 , is much larger .",
    "the conduction time , @xmath113 , is also much larger .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolution of the horizontally averaged temperature profile at various times .",
    "clearly , the profile evolves from a monotonically decreasing temperature to a vertically isothermal state . when the source of free energy is exhausted , _",
    "i.e. _ the temperature is isothermal , the instability shuts off and the system reaches its new hydrostatic state .",
    "despite the increase in the magnetic energy during the evolution of the instability , the magnetic pressure is still negligible .",
    "the final equilibrium state is simply a hydrostatic isothermal atmosphere .",
    "thus , we find that for adiabatic boundary conditions , the nonlinear saturated state of the mti is an isothermal temperature profile",
    ". these results are consistent with intuitive expectations .",
    "our fiducial model run n1 contains a uniform field and therefore a net magnetic flux .",
    "we have performed simulations of the nonlinear evolution of models with a sinusoidally varying horizontal field with no net flux , in order to investigate whether the final saturated state is affected .",
    "run n2 is identical to the fiducial model , except the that it is perturbed with gaussian white noise to seed multiple modes , and that it contains zero net initial magnetic flux .",
    "figure 7 shows the initial , linear , non - linear , and saturated states of the magnetic field at various times .",
    "the magnetic field structures here are much more complex than in the single - mode case .",
    "perhaps the most significant difference is the effect of magnetic reconnection .",
    "figure 8 plots the time evolution of horizontally - averaged magnetic and kinetic energies for run n2 .",
    "a significant contrast to the previous case is the decay of the magnetic field energy with time as a result of the anti - dynamo theorem @xcite and reconnection .",
    "the time evolution of the vertical temperature profile is within @xmath114 of the previous case , and therefore is not shown . through comparison of run",
    "n1 and n2 , the saturated hydrodynamic state seems to be independent of the single / multi - mode and zero / nonzero magnetic flux initial conditions .",
    "in addition , the saturated temperature profile does not depend on the initial magnetic field strength as long as @xmath115 .      in previous studies of the mri @xcite the effect of box size and resolution have been quantified .",
    "it is worth noting that our two dimensional simulations of the magnetothermal instability reflect a similar trend with respect to these simulation parameters .",
    "first , we define the magnetic field energy density amplification factor relative to the initial state as @xmath116 where , @xmath117 , is the time at saturation . as was seen with the mri , the saturation magnetic energy increases only very slightly with increasing resolution .",
    "secondly , saturation magnetic energy scales roughly linearly or slightly greater than linearly with the size of the simulation domain .",
    "of course , this measurement must be repeated in a three dimensional calculation to verify these results , as the anti - dynamo theorem changes the underlying physics significantly in 3d .      as was shown previously in ",
    "[ linearmag ] , the linear growth rate relative to maximum growth rate ( eq . [ maxgrowthrate ] ) of the mti is strongly dependent upon the magnetic field strength . in the case where the conductivity is entirely coulombic , @xmath118 ,",
    "the stability parameter , @xmath83 , is independent of the thermal conductivity .",
    "in addition to the dependence of the linear growth rate on the stability parameter , the saturated state is also dependent on the strength of the initial magnetic field .",
    "runs a1-a5 in table 1 explore this dependence by varying the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "this dependence manifests itself primarily in two quantifiable ways .",
    "first , the saturation magnetic field energy density , @xmath119 , increases monotonically as the magnetic field strength decreases ; thus , reducing the role of magnetic tension in retarding the growth of the instability . as the magnetic field strength increases , the instability is completely stabilized and",
    "the amplification factor is reduced to @xmath120 . the same general pattern is also demonstrated by the dependence of the growth rate on the stability parameter as seen in figure 2 .",
    "this similarity is not likely to be accidental .",
    "the second effect observed from the variation of the magnetic field strength is the degree of saturation obtained in terms of an isothermal temperature profile .",
    "figure 9 shows various saturated temperature profiles taken at the same time but with different stability parameters . where magnetic tension dominates",
    ", the temperature profiles have evolved less from the initial conditions . as the influence of the magnetic field decreases ,",
    "the temperature profiles become more isothermal .",
    "the profiles of simulations with higher magnetic field would _ not _ continue to evolve if the simulation were given more time , as the instability is simply turned off before its free energy source is completely used .",
    "essentially , the mti reduces the thermal gradient , the source of free energy , and amplifies the magnetic field ( increases the alfvn velocity ) until the two terms of equation [ mti_instability_criterion1 ] balance . a new",
    ", stable macroscopic thermodynamic equilibrium is then established .",
    "with adiabatic boundary conditions , there is a limited amount of free energy available to the system , and once saturation occurs , the motions decay away and a new vertical equilibrium corresponding to an isothermal atmosphere ( if @xmath121 ) is established . with conducting boundary conditions ,",
    "however , an isothermal profile across the domain can never be achieved .",
    "free energy to drive motions can always be tapped from the boundaries ; therefore , we might expect that sustained convection and turbulence are possible in this case . to test these expectations",
    ", we have performed a series of simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the mti using conducting boundary conditions .",
    "table 2 is a list of all runs using conducting boundary conditions discussed in this paper . as a fiducial model",
    ", we consider a simulation with zero initial net magnetic flux , run n3 , which is perturbed with multiple modes .",
    "an analogous case ( run n2 ) was considered in  4.2 for the adiabatic boundary condition .",
    "figure 10 shows the evolution of the magnetic field at various times .",
    "the linear evolution is not shown , but is quite similar to the adiabatic , multimode case ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "after the system reaches a quasi - equilibrium , bubbles of magnetic field emanate from the vertical boundaries and penetrate to the center of the atmosphere .",
    "these bubbles are reminiscent of nucleate boiling familiar from fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "one can observe the characteristic kelvin - helmholtz rolls on these bubbles .",
    "this boiling `` steady - state '' behavior is reached after approximately 2,000 sound - crossing times as reflected by the plot of the magnetic and kinetic energies shown in figure 11 .",
    "it is clear that after an initial spike some kinetic energy remains in the system , driven by the heat flux at the boundaries .",
    "the system is driven towards a more isothermal state with large boundary layers at the upper and lower surfaces of the simulation ( figure 12 ) .",
    "resolution studies show that as the simulation resolution is increased ( @xmath58 is shown ) the boundary layers shrink , and the interior region becomes closer to isothermal .",
    "we conclude that the fluid motion observed at late times is driven by the mti in an unresolved thermal boundary at the top and bottom edges of the domain .",
    "the resolution dependence of the boundary layer makes it difficult to determine the efficiency of heat transport by the magnetothermal instability in this case .    in fact ,",
    "the resulting vertical structure which emerges is not likely to be applicable to most astrophysical systems .",
    "the use of a solid reflecting wall kept at a constant temperature leads to a thin thermal boundary layer , and the structure of this layer determines the physics . in a real atmosphere",
    ", we expect the size of this boundary layer to be set by the size of the transition region from isotropic to anisotropic conduction .",
    "this will be explored further in  5.2 , where we use isotropic conduction to introduce resolved layers near the boundaries which are stably stratified with respect to the balbus criterion .",
    "this modification avoids the formation of thermal boundary layers at the wall .      as was shown in ",
    "[ lineariso ] , the linear growth rate of the mti is damped by the addition of isotropic conduction .",
    "this behavior is similar in many respects to that of the strong magnetic field case .",
    "the saturated state is also dependent upon the anisotropy parameter , @xmath92 .",
    "figure 13 shows the horizontally averaged temperature profiles at the time of saturation as calculated from runs i1-i4 . as can be seen ,",
    "even a modest amount of isotropic conduction , @xmath122 , is able to significantly reduce the saturation level of the instability .",
    "when the isotropic conduction is strong , @xmath123 , the temperature profile only marginally deviates from the initial condition .",
    "the driving term of the instability is reduced by the anisotropic fraction , thus , causing saturation after much less growth . in addition , the saturation magnetic energy density , @xmath119 , [ eq . ( [ deltaeqn ] ) ] scales monotonically with @xmath92 , asymptotically reaching its maximum value for purely anisotropic conduction .      a more realistic boundary condition is implemented by establishing an atmosphere with layers at the top and bottom that are stable according to the balbus criterion .",
    "this is accomplished by transitioning slowly from pure anisotropic conduction to isotropic conduction at the boundaries of the domain .",
    "we have performed a simulation , run n4 , with a domain @xmath124 , @xmath125 and a resolution of 100x250 .",
    "the average horizontal sound crossing time is slightly higher than the previous studies with @xmath126 .",
    "multiple modes are seeded with gaussian noise smoothed towards the vertical boundaries .",
    "the total conductivity is @xmath127 , while the isotropic and anisotropic conduction coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath72 are chosen such that the anisotropy parameter @xmath92 is @xmath129 since @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the conduction is purely isotropic near the boundaries , purely anisotropic in the center , and linearly interpolated in between .    the magnetic field strength is initialized to follow the same vertical profile , so that @xmath132 , with @xmath133 . with this definition ,",
    "the magnetic field is non - zero only in those regions that are at least slightly unstable by the balbus criterion .",
    "we can track the mixing of the stable and unstable layers by following the location of the field , since in ideal mhd the field is `` frozen in '' to the fluid .",
    "figure 14 shows the @xmath54 and @xmath55 components of the magnetic and kinetic energy averaged over the domain in run n4 .",
    "this plot is not much different than the previous driven case run n3 ( figure 11 ) , except the magnetic field does not decay in time due to the presence of a net magnetic flux .",
    "the background temperature profile only deviates slightly from the initial condition , indicating a fairly steady state .",
    "the most interesting insights come from examining the field lines at several different times as shown in figure 15 .",
    "the far left and middle left plots show the unstable central region in the linear and early non - linear phases . by the middle right plot , however , plumes driven by the mti have penetrated the convectively stable region , as evidenced by the magnetic field plume with kelvin - helmholtz roll . at a much later time ,",
    "when the system is essentially in steady state , much of the magnetic field has been stored in the stable region through convective overshoot .",
    "the phenomena of penetrative convection and overshooting has been thorougly studied in the magnetoconvection of stellar atmospheres , and it is likely this phenomenon is universal @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "this behavior could have important implications for a magnetic dynamo .",
    "a further diagnostic is the comparison of the magnitude of each component of the horizontally - averaged heat fluxes at different heights .",
    "in addition to the coulombic ( equation [ coulombic ] ) and radiative ( equation [ radiative ] ) heat fluxes , we define an advective heat flux , @xmath134 where , @xmath135 , is the fluid velocity , and @xmath136 , is the internal energy .",
    "figure 16 plots the time evolution of the vertical components of these three heat fluxes and the total heat flux at the midplane , and at 80% of the height of the domain in run n4 . at the former height",
    "only anisotropic conduction is present , while at the latter only isotropic conduction is present . at the midplane",
    "the oscillatory advective heat flux is clearly dominant at any given instant in time ; however , averaged in time the advective heat flux contributes roughly @xmath137 of the total heat flux .",
    "the coulombic flux , which is relatively constant in time , contributes the remaining @xmath138 .",
    "this fact is evident in table 3 , which lists the time- and horizontally - averaged total heat fluxes in the vertical direction at three different vertical heights .    to consider the heat conduction efficiency of the instability , we compare it to the expected heat flux across the simulation domain for pure uniform isotropic conductivity , namely @xmath139 .",
    "the time - averaged heat conduction at the midplane is @xmath140 , which indicates that the instability transports the entire applied heat flux .",
    "thus , we conclude that the mti efficiently transports heat flux in this two - dimensional case .",
    "given an atmosphere with @xmath141 and @xmath142 , one would expect it to be stable to convection . yet , if the density is low enough such that anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines is important , the atmosphere is in fact convectively _",
    "unstable _ , and it will establish a radically different hydrostatic equilibrium using the free energy provided by the initial temperature gradient .",
    "we refer to the new stability criterion in this case as the balbus criterion , and the convective instability that results as the magnetothermal instability .",
    "using time - dependent mhd simulations , we have verified the linear properties of the mti predicted by balbus @xcite .",
    "the growth rates and balbus criterion measured from the simulations agree well with linear theory . in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "the instability saturates as an isothermal atmosphere",
    ". steady convective turbulence can be driven if a fixed temperature difference is maintained across the upper and lower boundaries . in this case , the advective heat flux carried by fluid motions is larger than the conductive heat flux by a factor of two . the amplitude of the conductivity is important only in establishing the most unstable wavelength . for purely anisotropic conduction ,",
    "the maximum growth rate is independent of the conductivity .",
    "thus , our simulations show that if the balbus criterion is satisfied , unstable modes will produce vigorous motions and a significant heat flux , even if the conductivity is very small , and conduction times very long .",
    "we have also used simulations to study the effects of magnetic tension and isotropic conduction on the saturated state ; in both cases the mti saturates before an isothermal profile is established .",
    "there are several important directions for future studies .",
    "three dimensional simulations of driven , steady convection that explore the heat fluxes and dynamo action in the mti will be reported in a future paper .",
    "in addition , applications of the mti to specific astrophysical systems are warranted .",
    "two potential applications are of obvious and immediate interest .",
    "the first is to explore whether the mti can help explain the nearly isothermal temperature profiles observed in the outer regions of x - ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies @xcite . in this case ,",
    "anisotropic ion viscosity ( which has been ignored in this study ) may also be important .",
    "the second is to understand the effect of the mti on radiatively inefficient accretion flows . in particular",
    ", there is much interest in the transport properties of turbulence driven by convection @xcite versus the mri @xcite in such flows .",
    "however , since for diffuse plasmas the appropriate stability criterion is not the hiland but rather the balbus criterion , it is important to investigate how this changes the structure of the flow .",
    "we thank tom gardiner for his contributions to the athena code used here .",
    "ip acknowledges current support from the department of energy computational science graduate fellowship and previous support from the department of defense national defense science and engineering graduate fellowship .",
    "js acknowledges support from princeton university , and nsf grants ast-0413788 and ast-0413744 .",
    "the heat conduction equation for coulombic conduction is @xmath143 , \\label{app_heatconduction}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field . in cartesian coordinates , the right hand side may be written as @xmath144\\right]+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[\\hat{b}_y\\left[\\hat{b}_y\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial x } + \\hat{b}_y\\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial y}\\right]\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{app_rhs},\\ ] ] where @xmath145 $ ] is the @xmath54-component of the magnetic field normalized by the magnitude of @xmath146 . in order to develop a finite - difference representation of equation [ app_rhs ] , note that the athena code stores the magnetic field at cell faces and the temperature at cell centers .",
    "thus , the second @xmath147derivatives can be differenced as : @xmath148 and similarly for the second @xmath149derivative .",
    "the cross derivatives are considerably more complicated , requiring a 3x3 difference molecule to incorporate the change in the direction of the magnetic field across a cell . in addition , the mixed derivatives are written in a symmetrized way , so that the heat transport is manifestly conservative . for example , @xmath150}{4\\delta x\\delta y } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{\\hat{b}_{x , i-1/2,j}\\hat{b}_{y , i-1/2,j}\\left[\\left(t_{i-1,j+1}-t_{i-1,j-1}\\right)+\\left(t_{i , j+1}-t_{i , j-1}\\right)\\right]}{4\\delta x\\delta y}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the difference formula are implemented in an external module to the mhd integrator in athena .",
    "the two are combined using operator splitting  that is equation a1 is updated after a full timestep of the mhd equations .",
    "sub - cycling is used when the stability limit for the timestep used in the conduction module is smaller than the timestep resulting from the mhd algorithm .    to test the accuracy of the diffusion modeule ,",
    "we have computed the diffusion of a gaussian profile of temperature in a medium with uniform thermal conductivities . in our tests with straight magnetic field lines at an arbitrary angle to the grid the above finite differencing yields fractional l2 error norms that are @xmath151 , independent of angle .",
    "more complex tests involve anisotropic conduction along curved magnetic field lines .",
    "one of the more challenging test problems we devised is the conduction of heat along circular magnetic field lines .",
    "specifically the problem is defined on a domain spanning @xmath152 .",
    "a circular heat pulse is initialized in a region of an annulus defined as @xmath153 where in our simulation @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "figure 17 shows the quantitative convergence of the l1 error . at low resolution",
    "a large fraction of the error arises simply from the discretization of a curvilinear problem to a cartesian domain .    from conservation of energy",
    "we can estimate the effective cross - field diffusion coefficient .",
    "recall fourier s law of conduction for a heat flux , @xmath157 in units of @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "we can calculate the total energy passing through an area as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the cross - sectional area .",
    "take the 100x100 resolution case as a canonical example since it was used as our minimum resolution . at time",
    "@xmath161 when the annulus is essentially isothermal , the net heat that has leaked from the annulus is @xmath162 . by doing an order of magnitude estimate on equation [ heatestimate ]",
    "we find that @xmath163 implying that the ratio @xmath164 .",
    "as we have demonstrated previously , the instability is insensitive to isotropic conduction of this order of magnitude .",
