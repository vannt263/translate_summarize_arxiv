    "with the enormous progress of research on colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites@xcite over the last decade it has been realized that besides charge and spin also _ lattice degrees of freedom _  @xcite play a significant role in the formation of the cmr and the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . special attention focused on the optimal doped manganites , characterized by the largest cmr effects  in particular , la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lcmo ) .",
    "as the temperature range in which the cmr effect and the mit are observed is close to room temperature , these compounds have become potential candidates for technical applications .",
    "the phonon excitation spectrum has been studied in detail for undoped lamno@xmath2  @xcite which is , below approximately 750  k , in a jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted orthorhombic ( pnma ) structure . a theoretical analysis of the complete set of phonon modes in the doped compounds is still missing .",
    "lcmo has an orthorhombic symmetry whereas the sr - doped compound , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) , is rhombohedrally distorted .",
    "the infrared - active phonons of undoped rhombohedral ( r@xmath3c ) lamno@xmath2 were identified  @xcite however these zero - doping investigations can not make up for experiments at finite doping .",
    "in fact , the local mn - o geometry depends strongly on the size of the ions and doping concentration  @xcite which accounts for the structural differences between lcmo and lsmo .",
    "experimental studies of two single crystals , undoped and with @xmath4% sr - doping , were performed by paolone _",
    "et al._@xcite they discussed the assignment of all infrared active phonon modes in lamno@xmath2 at low temperature .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports on phonon modes in the metallic phase of lsmo . for bulk samples of lcmo , three sets of broad phonon bands",
    "are observed which reveal external- , bending- and stretching - type lattice vibrations , as classified in the cubic symmetry .",
    "@xcite    apart from providing a fingerprint of the lattice structure , phononic spectra can indicate the relevance of electronic correlations .",
    "the dominant effect of mobile electrons on the lattice vibrations is generically a suppression of phononic resonances due to screening . for metals",
    ", this may render the phonons unobservable in far - infrared ( fir ) optical spectroscopy .",
    "however , since the polycrystalline samples are poor metals , and even more so the investigated thin films , phonon resonances are still clearly resolved even in the conducting low - temperature ferromagnetic phase .    in lcmo",
    "a significant shift of the stretching mode near the mit was found  @xcite and associated with a reduced screening through charge carriers close to the mit .",
    "although the observed shifts of phonons in lcmo are evidently related to electronic correlations since they come along with the mit it is not obvious that they are explained exclusively by a reduced screening .",
    "in particular , not all phonon modes display the shift and , furthermore , in lsmo we observe phononic shifts which are tied to the ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic ( fm - pm ) transition , not the mit ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : comp ] ) . in lcmo",
    "the fm - pm transition and the mit coincide whereas in lsmo they are well separated .",
    "a comparative study of lcmo and lsmo should address and illuminate the fundamental question if the phononic excitations couple to spin degrees of freedom .    since the phonon resonances are well pronounced in the optical spectroscopy measurements of the metallic manganite films they provide a unique opportunity to analyze the consequences of a coupling of lattice degrees of freedom ( dof ) with spin and charge .",
    "correlation of lattice dof with charge dof has to be in an weak ( lsmo ) to strong coupling range ( lcmo ) as , for example , the polaronic excitations in the mid - infrared ( mir ) evidence a coupling in this range.@xcite also neutron diffraction measurements for lcmo revealed an anomalous volume thermal expansion at the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic mit,@xcite which has to originate from a sufficiently strong coupling .",
    "we will elaborate further on the consequences of a strong phonon - electron coupling for the phononic resonances in this paper and we will identify the characteristics in the fir spectra signifying cooperative dynamics not only of lattice and electronic charge but also of lattice and spin degrees of freedom .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .",

    "the spectra confirm the anticipated mode structure for the respective symmetry of the lattice and prove the high quality of the thin films . in sec .",

    "[ sec : fano ] , we discuss fano - like modifications of the line shape of distinct phonon modes in lcmo which testify a significant coupling of the lattice excitations to the electronic continuum in the ca - doped manganite films .",
    "the interference of nearly degenerate modes with electronic excitations may result in spectral weight transfer and level repulsion which we discuss within a phenomenological approach for coupled phononic and electronic modes .",
    "a summary of our findings and conclusions are presented in the last section , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the films for this investigation have been prepared using a standard pulsed laser deposition technique.@xcite lcmo was grown to a thickness of 200  nm onto ndgao@xmath2 single crystalline substrates .",
    "lsmo  # 1 with a thickness of @xmath5  nm and lsmo  # 2 with @xmath6  nm were deposited on ( laalo@xmath2)@xmath7(sr@xmath8altao@xmath9)@xmath10 .",
    "x - ray diffraction of lcmo revealed an orthorhombic structure with a preferred growth along the [ 110 ] axis while lsmo was confirmed to be in a rhombohedral structure with preferred growth along the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "the infrared reflectivities of the sample and the pure substrate were measured using a combination of fourier transform spectrometers , bruker ifs 113v and ifs 66 v / s , to cover the frequency range from 50 to 40000  @xmath11 .",
    "temperature dependent measurements from 6  to 295  k were performed with a he - cryostat .",
    "higher temperatures were measured in a home made oven in which the sample was exposed to a continuous flow of heated nitrogen gas . to obtain the optical conductivity @xmath12 a kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis",
    "was performed which included the results from submillimeter spectroscopy between 5 and 30  @xmath11 . applying the fresnel optical formulas for the complex reflectance coefficient of the substrate - film system , the optical conductivity for the films was calculated.@xcite    magnetization measurements",
    "were carried out between 2 and 400  k by using a commercial quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "the dc resistance measurements were performed by a standard four - probe method .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ac resistancee was done in a mach - zehnder interferometer arrangement , which allows the measurements of both , transmission and phase shift . applying the fresnel formulas , the ac resistance was determined directly without any approximations .",
    "upper panel ( lsmo ) : temperature dependence of the magnetization at @xmath13  oe ( left scale ) and dc - resistivity ( right scale ) .",
    "lower panel ( lcmo ) : magnetization at @xmath14  oe ( left scale ) ; dc- and ac - resistivity at @xmath15  ghz ( right scale ) . ]    frequently , manganite films exhibit fm transition temperatures @xmath16 lower than those reported for the bulk materials with the same nominal composition .",
    "the differences can be attributed to grain boundaries , strain , microstructure depending on the details of the growth process and on the lattice parameters of the substrate.@xcite they all result in a variation of the strength of the lattice distortion , which determines the structure and , accordingly , the electrical and magnetic behavior .",
    "it is well known , that differences between bulk samples and thin films can occur , depending on the quality of the films .",
    "however , we observe that the overall optical characteristics of the films are in good agreement with bulk properties .    .metal - insulator ( @xmath17 ) , magnetic ( @xmath18 ) and electric ( @xmath19 ) transition temperatures of the lcmo and lsmo films .

    "[ ca - fano ] exhibit a dip on the high - energy side , a consequence of the negative sign of the coupling parameters .",
    "the coupling constant is proportional to the effective mass . in manganites",
    "the carriers have hole character.@xcite the associated inverse sign of the effective mass may be responsible for a negative value of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that neither a coupling to the drude nor to the incoherent contribution can induce the nearly perfect antisymmetric shape of the 114  @xmath11 peak - dip structure .",
    "only a sufficiently strong coupling to the polaronic excitation supports this antisymmetric fano shape .",
    "the increase of coupling strength @xmath22 with temperature is significant .",
    "it results from the fact that the line shape keeps its antisymmetric form up to the highest temperature ( 295  k ) while the electronic background is reduced by a factor 8 from 160  k to 295  k. since the line shape of the phonon is controlled by a product of the coupling constant and the strength of the polaronic background ( @xmath23 ) , the coupling constant has to increase correspondingly to keep the observed shape .",
    "the line shapes of the two modes at about 170  @xmath11 do not deviate strongly from lorentzians which is consistent with rather small couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( cf .  tab .",
    "[ doublemode ] ) .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the `` hump '' in between the phonon at 114  @xmath11 and the nearly degenerate external modes at about 170  @xmath11 one needs a sufficiently strong electron - phonon coupling @xmath26 to the electronic resonance at about 300  @xmath11 .",
    "these electron - phonon couplings , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , affect the position and the spectral weight of the resonances at @xmath28 and @xmath29 considerably .",
    "the three coupled modes ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) constitute a `` triad '' with a bonding ( lowest ) , non - bonding ( intermediate ) and anti - bonding state . the bonding and anti - bonding modes always experience level repulsion so that the bare frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be both at 171  @xmath11 ( degenerate modes , cf .  tab .",
    "[ doublemode ] ) but the two resonances are still well separated at 295  k ( at 167  @xmath11 and at 171  @xmath11 , cf .   fig .",
    "[ ca - fano ] and tab .",
    "[ tabmoden - ca ] ) .  @xcite the level repulsion is accompanied by a transfer of spectral weight : according to tab .",
    "[ doublemode ] and fig .",
    "[ ca - fano ] , the lowest mode of the triad takes nearly all its weight from the electronic mode at 295  k. this observation may explain why the two - mode structure at 170  @xmath11 in lcmo is still intense at or above the mit whereas in lsmo the mode at about 170  @xmath11 is weak ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ external ] , right panel ) . in fig .",
    "[ ca_fano_vgl_t295 ] we display the `` bare modes '' , with parameters of tabs .  [ tab - ca - fano ] and [ doublemode ] , jointly with the interaction - dominated mode spectrum in order to summarize visually the effects of the strong electron - coupling on the external mode group in lcmo .",
    "fits of the low frequency phonon group with and without electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling for data at room temperature . ]",
    "in contrast to lcmo , the phonon spectra for lsmo exhibit no asymmetric shape and can be described by lorentzian oscillators . in the latter compound",
    "the electron - phonon coupling is smaller , as is confirmed by shape , position and temperature dependence of the polaronic mid - infrared ( mir ) resonance.@xcite",
    "manganite thin films provide an excellent opportunity to study the phononic excitations of lsmo and lcmo in their metallic phases .",
    "the films allow for a well - resolved , distinct phonon spectrum in infrared spectroscopy , even for temperatures well below the mit .",
    "in lsmo we identified each of the eight infrared - active phonons expected for the r@xmath3c symmetry and in lcmo we were able to resolve 18 out of 25 phonons expected for the pnma - symmetry .",
    "the phonon spectra reveal a number of anomalies which result from a finite electron - lattice coupling and which confirm the importance of cooperative effects of microscopic degrees of freedom when approaching the ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic and the metal - insulator transition .",
    "first and most apparent , we observe that the fir spectra change substantially up to the mit ( see figs .  [ ca - r - temp ] and [ sr - r - temp ] ) but then , above the mit , temperature dependent modifications are negligible .",
    "this overall @xmath31-dependence of the spectra up to the mit is related to a strongly reduced screening of the phononic excitations , due to localization or diffusive motion of electronic charges .",
    "however also a coupling of lattice and spin degrees of freedom is evidenced by the phononic excitation spectrum : temperature dependent shifts of several phonon modes , which vary on the same temperature scale as the magnetization , confirm the correlation of these degrees of freedom ( see figs .  [ ca - min ]  [ casquid ] ) .    in lcmo the pronounced asymmetric line shapes , observed for several phonons ( see figs .",
    "[ ca - phononen ] and [ ca - fano ] ) , are a manifestation of the strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we analyzed the fano lineshapes of the external group within a phenomenological approach .",
    "@xcite it assigns independent modes to the various spectral contributions of the electronic excitations and couples them linearly to the phononic oscillators . in fir and mir spectra of lcmo , three electronic continua",
    "are typically identified : a `` continuum of incoherent electronic excitations '' ( cf .  refs .  ) , observed as a background to the phonons in the fir range , polaronic excitations in the mir and possibly a rather insignificant drude contribution on the low - frequency side of the fir spectrum .",
    "the lineshape of the lowest - frequency external mode , which is remarkably antisymmetric at all temperatures , can be reproduced only with a strong coupling to the polaronic excitations .",
    "in contrast , the fir continuum , which is parameterized by a strongly damped oscillator spectral function , is responsible for frequency shifts ( level repulsion ) and transfer of spectral weight from the electronic excitations into distinct phononic modes ( see fig .  [ ca_fano_vgl_t295 ] ) . in the presented scheme , we find that the mode splitting of the 170  @xmath11 resonance and its considerable spectral weight at high temperature ( above the mit ) is induced by the electronic continuum .",
    "this observation may explain the discrepancy with lsmo where these two external modes are degenerate at high temperature since lsmo is characterized by a weaker electron - phonon coupling where fano - like lineshapes are entirely missing .",
    "a microscopic evaluation is mandatory in order to assign unambiguously these anomalous characteristics of the phononic spectra to the interference with specific electronic excitations .",
    "the preliminary identification within the phenomenological approach has provided ample motivation for such an effort .",
