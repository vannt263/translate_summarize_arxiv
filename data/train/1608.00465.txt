    "as different processes in active galaxies ( agn ) result in emission in different energy ranges , a crucial class of information for understanding black hole , accretion disk , and jet systems is the intrinsic population characteristics of agn in widely separated wavebands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these tell us how agn have evolved in different wavebands over the history of the universe , as well as their luminosity and spectral distributions , and the correlations among the different waveband emissions .",
    "knowledge of these are necessary to constrain models of emission mechanisms as well as establish luminosity functions and integrated outputs at given wavelengths and their relation to those at other wavelengths .",
    "this work focuses on the mid - infrared population properties of quasars , an important class of agn , using a dataset of over 20,000 quasars seen with the wide field infrared explorer satellite ( _ wise _  * ? ? ?",
    "as we wish to focus on the mid - infrared wavelengths that are most distinct in emission from the near - infrared , we are interested in particular in the properties of quasars in the longest _ wise _ wavelength 22 @xmath0 m band .",
    "multiple strategies are possible for compiling a dataset of agn from an infrared survey to determine infrared population properties . on the one hand",
    ", one can select agn candidates using color or spectral - based selection in the infrared .",
    "this technique has been utilized with combined _ spitzer _ infrared space telescope and _ wise _ data by @xcite who determine luminosity functions at 5 @xmath0 m . alternately",
    ", one can select potential agn candidates from infrared colors and perform optical followups and/or matches to optical catalogs to classify objects and derive redshifts .",
    "this technique has been used with combined infrared space observatory and infrared astronomical satellite data by @xcite who , using spectral fits , determine 15 @xmath0 m luminosity functions . alternately , one could use optically identified quasars from the overlap of a deep optical survey area and a deep infrared survey .",
    "this has been utilized with _",
    "data by @xcite and @xcite who present luminosity functions at 8 @xmath0 m and 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 , and 24 @xmath0 m , respectively . of these techniques",
    "the first two have the advantage of detecting agn which are obscured in the optical ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the potential disadvantages of missing agn which do not display the requisite infrared colors , and the inability to classify agn as specifically quasars or another type .",
    "the third technique has the advantage of being complete in the optical for a class of agn but could miss other optically obscured objects .",
    "some of the aforementioned works have the advantage of not being substantially flux - limited in the optical , either because of the use of infrared selection criteria for identification or the use of deep fields or both .",
    "however , in contrast to their advantages , all three of the previously listed compilation techniques have the disadvantage of having a small number of agn objects , numbering in the hundreds , or using photometric redshifts with complicated incompletness and selection considerations in the case of @xcite .",
    "they also may be subject to complex or incompletely understood selection effects in one or more wavebands such as in @xcite , and require spectral modeling in many cases .",
    "in this work we are interested in performing a complementary determination of agn population characteristics in the mid - infrared with a dataset covering a large portion of the sky with objects numbering in the tens of thousands , with complete spectroscopic redshifts , in which the selection effects are known and in which the crucial population characteristics are determined directly from the data non - parametrically with minimal modeling and assumptions .",
    "this can be done by restricting to quasars and using _ wise _ data , along with techniques which we have developed .",
    "given that the largest catalogs of quasars with redshifts are identified and catalogued by their optical spectral characteristics , a large dataset such as this used to evaluate population characteristics of quasars in another band depends on an optical survey as well and thus the limits of that survey . in order to evaluate the luminosity evolution in both mid - infrared and optical , and to separate and compare these effects , we require a dataset that has both infrared and optical fluxes to reasonable and known limits across a broad range of redshifts .",
    "the overlap of the _ wise _ satellite allwise catalog with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalog @xcite , can form such a dataset .",
    "when dealing with data from a large survey in the @xmath3 waveband , the luminosity function is usually obtained from a flux limited sample @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the flux limit of the @xmath6th object and the luminosity being @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the luminosity distance and @xmath9 stands for the k - correction . for a pure power law emission spectrum of index",
    "@xmath10 defined as @xmath11 , one has @xmath12 . this simple form may be augmented by the presence of emission lines , as in the optical data in this work .",
    "in general , the determination of the full luminosity function and its evolution requires analysis of the bi - variate distribution @xmath13 .",
    "a correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is known as luminosity evolution and would need to be taken into account when determining the distributions of the individual variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the case of quasars here with the optical and some other band luminosity , because an optical measurement is necessary for quasar identification and spectroscopic redshift , we have at least a tri - variate function .",
    "we must take into account not only the correlations between the redshift and individual luminosities ( i.e. the two luminosity evolutions ) but also the possible intrinsic correlation between the two luminosities , before individual distributions can be determined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . treating the infrared survey data as a stand - alone sample independent of the optical survey truncations and the relations between infrared and optical luminosities is not appropriate .",

    "we seek a subset with a well - defined flux - limit for inclusion for every object and a reduced bias in the redshift distribution . in the sdss dr7 ,",
    "objects were identified as quasar candidates for spectroscopic follow - up if they displayed the requisite optical colors , or if identified via rosat x - ray data , or if selected by a so - called `` serendipity '' algorithm that identifies unusual colors in concert with a radio match , or if they had a radio match within @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this means that the full dr7 quasar catalog can not be considered to be truly optically flux - limited in at any given magnitude limit .    to obtain a set that is flux - limited in the optical band , we restrict the full set in two ways .",
    "first we allow only those objects that display the requisite optical colors for follow - up or are identified via a radio match within @xmath24 ( the latter criterion applies to less than 1 % of objects ) , and only those objects which are unextended .",
    "this corresponds to requiring that the target flag be set to `` 1 '' in one of three columns in the dr7 quasar catalog  the low - z target selection flag ( # 55 ) , the high - z target selection flag ( # 56 ) , and the first selection flag ( # 57 )  and that a flag be set to `` 0 '' for extended morphology ( column # 33 ) , and reduces the full catalog from 105,760 to 62,276 objects .",
    "next we impose a k - corrected @xmath25-band magnitude limit of 19.1 at redshift 2 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite this results in a catalog with a smoother redshift distribution with a reduced bias toward objects with @xmath262 ( although still with residual biases in the redshift distribution as discussed further in  [ dev ] ) .",
    "it results in a catalog that is flux - limited at every redshift , although that flux limit is somewhat redshift dependent .",
    "the magnitude criterion reduces the set further to 21,600 objects .",
    "we consider this as the parent set of identified quasars for which we seek an infrared match .",
    "the luminosities of the dr7 quasars are shown in figure [ opts ] , and the raw redshift distributions of subsamples discussed here are shown in figure [ optsreds ] .",
    "we also note the presence of an upper limit @xmath25 band magnitude of 15.0 for inclusion in the catalog .",
    "however this criterion is not completely rigorous , as mentioned in @xcite , and corresponds to a luminosity higher than almost all sources .",
    "the allwise catalog is an extension to the _ wise _ general all - sky data release that combines data from the cryogenic and post - cryogenic ( neowise  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey phases .",
    "it contains over 700 million objects observed by _",
    "wise _ in the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath0 m mid - infrared bandpasses ( known as w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 respectively ) .",
    "we match the allwise catalog with the restricted set of sdss dr7 quasars with a two arcsecond matching radius criterion , resulting in 20,063 matches with a detection in the 22@xmath0 m band , defined as having a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) value greater than two .",
    "there are zero multiple matches with this matching radius . reducing the matching radius to one arcsecond results in only a slight reduction of 3% in the number of matches .",
    "therefore two arcseconds is an appropriate choice to include real matches while eliminating spurious ones . over 95% of the parent flux - limited optical set",
    "have an infrared match with a detection in the 22@xmath0 m band .    for the k - corrections to calculate luminosities in the optical band , we adopt the full @xmath27 power law continuum _ plus _ emission line k - corrections presented in @xcite and discussed in  5 and table 4 of that work .",
    "the methods of this work can then account for any bias resulting from emission line effects , as long as they are included in the conversions from luminosity to flux , i.e. in the k - corrections .",
    "for the 22 @xmath0 m infrared k - correction , we note that studies have generally shown that quasar spectral energy distributions transition from being roughly flat ( @xmath28 ) in l@xmath29 space between 100 and @xmath30 10 @xmath0 m to having @xmath31 at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in light of this",
    "we adopt a 24@xmath0 m k - correction scheme in which the k - correction has @xmath32 [ @xmath33 = 1+@xmath15 ] for @xmath35 1.4 and @xmath36 [ @xmath33 = 2.4 ] for @xmath37 1.4 with a smooth leveling off .",
    "we adopt this population - averaged k - correction scheme in part to avoid the additional truncation and bias complications that would result from requiring an observation of every object in the sample in every other _ wise _ band in order to fit an infrared spectrum .",
    "figures [ influms ] and [ optlums ] show the infrared and optical luminosities versus redshifts of the quasars in the constructed sdss x _ wise _ sample .",
    "the limiting optical flux for inclusion in the data set is a function of redshift , and corresponds to the @xmath25-band magnitude 19.1 at @xmath15=2 k - corrected to the redshift in question .",
    "it thus has a slight dependence on redshift , as can be seen in figure [ optlums ] .",
    "on the other hand , the limiting 22 @xmath0 m infrared flux for inclusion in the survey , and therefore the limiting 22 @xmath0 m luminosity for inclusion of a particular object , depends on that object s snr in that waveband . in particular , since an snr of 2 is the lowest snr for an object to have a flux reported at 22 @xmath0 m , the lower limiting flux in that band ( w4 ) for an object @xmath6 to be included in the sample is @xmath38 the minimum limiting 22 @xmath0 m luminosity that an object could have to be included in the survey is a function of its lower limiting flux and redshift , with the standard luminosity - redshift relation @xmath39 and @xmath40 . some minimum limiting 22 @xmath0 m luminosities",
    "are shown in figure [ influms ] .",
    "we have also explored using subsequent data releases of sdss quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) phase of the project @xcite . as the boss project is optimized to detect galaxies in a certain redshift range and not to produce a complete flux - limited quasar catalog while minimizing detection biases , we find that these catalogs are inferior to the dr7 catalog for our purposes .",
    "the boss catalog actually results in fewer matches to _ wise _ sources than the dr7 .",
    "we have also performed the analysis in this work with a significantly less restricted parent optical set , consisting of the dr7 quasars that simply have an @xmath25-band magnitude less than 19.1 and neglecting the target flags and the k - corrections to the magnitude for inclusion .",
    "this results in a uniform flux optical limit for inclusion , with a parent optical set of 63,492 objects and a matched 22 @xmath0 and optical set of 49,415 objects .",
    "the major conclusions for the luminosity evolutions , the correlations between the luminosities , and the local luminosity functions obtained using that alternate data set are quite similar to those obtained with the more restrictive data set , indicating a robustness of the results in this work .",
    "the luminosity function gives the number of objects per unit comoving volume @xmath41 per unit source luminosity , so that the number density is @xmath42 and the total number is @xmath43 . to examine luminosity evolution , without loss of generality , we can write a luminosity function in some waveband @xmath3 as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 describe the luminosity evolution and comoving density evolution with redshift respectively and @xmath47 stands for parameters that describe the shape ( e.g. power law indices and break values ) of the @xmath3 band luminosity funtion . in what follows",
    "we assume a non - evolving shape for the luminosity function ( i.e. @xmath48 , independent of @xmath49 and @xmath15 ) , which is a good approximation for determining the global evolutions .",
    "the later point is discussed in  [ testass ] . once the luminosity evolution @xmath45",
    "is determined using the methods described below we can obtain the mono - variate distributions of the independent variables @xmath50 and @xmath15 , namely the density evolution @xmath46 and `` local '' luminosity function @xmath51 .",
    "the total number of observed objects is then @xmath52    we consider this form of the luminosity function for luminosities in different bands , allowing for separate ( optical and infrared ) luminosity evolutions .",
    "we use a parameterization for the luminosity evolution with redshift @xmath53 which has been shown to be a goot fit for a dataset based on sdss with many @xmath54 objects @xcite .",
    "as discussed in that work , good value of @xmath55 is 3.7 , but the precise value does not matter for the analysis . with @xmath56 for positive values of @xmath57 the luminosities @xmath58 refer to the de - evolved values at @xmath59 , hence the name `` local '' .",
    "we discuss the determination of the evolution factors @xmath60 , which in this parameterization becomes a determination of @xmath57 , in ",
    "[ evsec ] .",
    "the density evolution function @xmath46 is determined by the method shown  [ dev ] . once these are determined we construct the local ( de - evolved ) luminosity function @xmath61 as in  [ local ] .      in general , determination of the evolution of the luminosity function of extragalactic sources with spectroscopic redshifts for any wavelength band except optical involves a tri - variate distribution because spectroscopic and most photometric redshift determination requires optical observations which introduces additional observational selection bias and data truncation .",
    "thus , in a case such as this , unless redshifts are known for all sources in an infrared survey from infrared data alone , we need to determine the combined luminosity function @xmath62 from a tri - variate distribution of @xmath15 and the fluxes in the optical and mid - infrared bands .",
    "if the optical and mid - infrared luminosities were statistically independent variables , then this luminosity function would be separable in the form of @xmath63 and we would be dealing with two bi - variate distributions .",
    "however , there may also be a correlation between the two luminosities . as described below",
    ", the methods employed here allow us to determine whether any pair of variables are independent or correlated .",
    "if it is determined that the luminosities are correlated ( see  [ roevsec ] ) , the question must be asked how much of this luminosity correlation is intrinsic to the population and how much is induced in the data by flux limits and/or similar luminosity evolutions with redshift .",
    "determination of this is quite intricate as discussed in e.g. @xcite and appendix b of @xcite , and has not been explored sufficiently in the literature . while this will be the subject of future investigations ,",
    "here we will consider both possibilities .    at one extreme ,",
    "if the luminosity correlation is intrinsic and not induced , one should seek a coordinate transformation to define a new pair of variables which are independent .",
    "this requires a functional form for the transformation .",
    "we define a new luminosity which we call a `` correlation reduced infrared luminosity '' @xmath64 , where the function @xmath65 describes the correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a fiducial luminosity taken here as it is lower than the lowest 2500  luminosity considered in our sample , but results do not depend on the particular choice of numerical value . ] to be @xmath69erg s@xmath2hz@xmath2 . for the correlation function",
    "we will assume a simple power law @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a bulk power law correlation index to be determined from the data .",
    "this is essentially a coordinate rotation in the log - log luminosity space . as shown in ",
    "[ evsec ] below , we can determine a best fit value for the index @xmath71 which orthogonalizes the new luminosities .",
    "given the correlation function we can then transform the data ( and its truncation ) into the new independent pair of luminosities @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the local luminosity functions of uncorrelated luminosities @xmath74 and @xmath75 can then be used to recover the local infrared luminosity function by a straight forward integration over @xmath75 and the true local optical luminosity function as @xmath76 the mid - infrared luminosities also undergo luminosity evolution with @xmath77^{\\alpha } \\label{gradform}\\ ] ] ( cf equation [ rcrdef ] ) .    at the other extreme ,",
    "if the correlation between the luminosities is entirely induced by truncation effects and similar redshift evolutions , then the luminosity functions are separable into @xmath78 as described above and the analysis can proceed from there .    as noted above , we will consider both possibilities here as extreme cases .",
    "it turns out that the major results obtained in both cases are very similar .",
    "here we first give a brief summary of the algorithmic strategy involved in these determinations , which was first proposed by efron and petrosian and has been expanded upon in recent works .",
    "this method uses a modified rank test to determine the best - fit values of parameters describing the correlation functions using the test statistic    @xmath79    to test the independence of two variables in a dataset , say ( @xmath80 ) for @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is the dependent variable ( @xmath83 ) rank of the data point @xmath6 in a set associated with it , @xmath84 is the expectation value and @xmath85 is the variance , where @xmath86 is the number of objects in object @xmath6 s associated set . for untruncated data ( i.e. data truncated parallel to the axes ) the set associated with point @xmath6 includes all of the points with a lower ( or higher , but not both ) independent variable value ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "the @xmath83 data are adjusted by defining @xmath92 and the rank test is repeated , with different values of parameters of the function @xmath65 until @xmath93 and @xmath88 are determined to be uncorrelated .    in this analysis",
    "we can ignore the upper optical flux limit of sdss quasars discussed in  [ datasec ] .",
    "the reason for this is that data truncations are only consequential in this analysis if the truncation is actually depriving the sample of data points that exist . as can be seen in figure [ opts ] ,",
    "there are very few objects approaching the optical upper truncation limit , indicating that this truncation does not appreciably alter the sample from the underlying population .",
    "all of the truncations , therefore , are one - sided  i.e. at the lower end of fluxes and luminosities .      as an example of the determination of a correlation , here we will determine the observed correlation between the observed infrared and optical luminosities . assuming the correlation function between the luminosities of the form of equation [ rcrdef ] we calculate the test statistic @xmath89 from equation [ tauen ] as a function of @xmath71 .",

    "because we now are dealing with a three dimensional distribution ( @xmath102 ) and two correlation functions ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , plus we can find the true intrinsic correlation in this case because the truncation effects in the luminosity - redshift space are known and redshift is the independent variable in both cases .",
    "since we have two criteria for truncation , the associated set for each object @xmath105 includes only those objects that are sufficiently luminous in both bands to have been in the survey if they were located at the redshift of the object in question . as discussed in  [ datasec ] , for the optical data , this would be all objects with a luminosity greater than the limiting optical luminosity at the redshift of object @xmath105 given the optical flux limit as a function of redshift , while for the 22 @xmath0 m infrared data this is all objects whose luminosity is greater than their minimum limiting luminosity calculated at the redshift of object @xmath105 ( i.e. equation [ lumlimeq ] with @xmath106 ) .    the luminosity cutoff limits for a given redshift must also be adjusted by factors of @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",

    "@xmath172 so we would expect no appreciable error on the normalization of the mid - infrared luminosity function from this effect . for the optical luminosity function @xmath173 , and",

    "we can pursue an upper limit on this effect by considering a related quantity which is readily available from the data sets  how fractional measurement errors in flux depend on flux .",
    "the optical data show only a modest dependence on @xmath25 band reported error with magnitude at magnitudes below 19.1 , with magnitude errors at most a factor of 1.5 higher at the highest magnitude end of that range than for the lowest magnitudes , which corresponds to a small differential fractional flux error .",
    "the 22 @xmath0 m data show a stronger dependence of the reported error in the measured magnitude on the magnitude leading to reported fractional errors in flux which are three to four times higher for the faintest fluxes as for the brightest .",
    "however data at a given flux corresponds to a wide range of luminosities , especially at the lowest fluxes .",
    "for example as mentioned above in both bands the objects with the lowest fluxes densely span an order of magnitude in local luminosity , which would significantly wash out the systematic dependence of fractional errors on flux when considering if fractional errors in luminosity vary systematically with luminosity .",
    "thus we consider that the dependence of fractional errors in luminosity on luminosity are small enough in both bands , which along with the above consideration that the faint end differential source counts are relatively flat in the 22 @xmath0 m band , leads to the conclusion that any effect on the power law slopes of either of the luminosity functions is negligible .",
    "_ redshift bias in the sdss quasar catalog _ : one could ask if the density evolution determined here is affected by any biases toward certain redshifts in the sdss quasar sample . as stated in @xcite ,",

    "we further address issue 2 by incorporating the sdss quasar selection function derived in @xcite and correct the derived redshift distribution at each redshift for the incompleteness as discussed in  [ dev ] .",

    "* ) , both of these evolutions are less dramatic than in the radio band .",
    "this provides an important input to constrain models of jet , accretion disk , and torus emission and their evolution over the history of the universe .",
    "for example , in the basic models of agn where the spin energy of the black hole is tapped to create the jets ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , faster radio evolution than optical would indicate that the spin parameters of black holes were higher in the past since radio emission overwhelmingly results from jets .",
    "since mid - infrared emission in agn is some combination of emission from the dusty tori , the jets , and the host galaxies , the significantly less rapid evolution of infrared emission in comparison with radio would confirm that jet emission is a sub - dominant source of infrared emission .",
    "we also show in  [ localinf ] that the local 22 @xmath0 m mid - infrared luminosity function of quasars @xmath152 shows a dramatic flattening at luminosities below @xmath175erg s@xmath2hz@xmath2 .",

    "<S> we determine the 22@xmath0 m luminosity evolution and luminosity function for quasars from a data set of over 20,000 objects obtained by combining flux - limited sloan digital sky survey optical and wide field infrared survey explorer mid - infrared data . </S>",
    "<S> we apply methods developed in previous works to access the intrinsic population distributions non - parametrically , taking into account the truncations and correlations inherent in the data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the population of quasars exhibits positive luminosity evolution with redshift in the mid - infrared , but with considerably less mid - infrared evolution than in the optical or radio bands . with the luminosity evolutions accounted for </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the density evolution and local mid - infrared luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the latter displays a sharp flattening at local luminosities below @xmath1erg s@xmath2hz@xmath2 , which has been reported previously at 15 @xmath0 m for agn classified as both type-1 and type-2 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the integrated total emission from quasars at 22 @xmath0 m and find it to be a small fraction of both the cosmic infrared background light and the integrated emission from all sources at this wavelength . </S>"
