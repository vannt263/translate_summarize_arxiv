    "we consider singularities which are simple folds .    the standard way to remedy the failure of parameter continuation at simple folds is to reparameterize the problem by introducing the arclength parameter , @xmath3 , so that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on @xmath3 .",
    "this idea , known as _ pseudo - arclength continuation _",
    "@xcite , implements parameter continuation on @xmath0 with @xmath3 as the parameter instead of solving @xmath8 with @xmath2 as the parameter .",

    "our first goal (   [ sec : nonsing ] ) is to quantify this nonsingularity . to this end",
