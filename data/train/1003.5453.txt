    "to reduce power loss in electric circuits , we have to minimize the circuit length .",
    "this kind of problems are formulated into a more generic task to minimize or maximize a real single - valued function of multivariables .",
    "this is the optimization problem .",
    "the cases in which variables take discrete values are known as combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "to solve these problems is one of the most important tasks and has broad applications in science and engineering .",
    "one of the generic algorithms to tackle such problems is simulated annealing ( sa ) , which has been developed to obtain the ground state of complex system such as the spin glasses , namely the minimization of the energy by stochastic searching in complicated phase space @xcite .",
    "the system is driven by decreasing the temperature , which controls thermal fluctuations , according to a certain schedule .",
    "if the decrease speed is slow enough , the system stays at quasiequilibrium at each temperature .",
    "we hope that the system reaches its ground state in the end",
    ". however the existence of many local minima of the free energy of spin glasses leads to a plenitude of time scales which make it difficult to reach the equilibrium state , the global minimum , experimentally or in numerical simulations .",
    "it is thus sometimes difficult to find a correct solution in the protocol of sa due to the long equilibration time on spin glasses .",
    "most of the optimization problems are expected to have similar difficulties since they can be mapped into searching problem of the ground state of spin glasses .",
    "the above fact implies that the system during the process of sa applied to difficult problems is not close to their equilibrium .",
    "we therefore search for useful tools in nonequilibrium statistical physics to mitigate the difficulties . during the last decade ,",
    "a number of exact relations have been derived for nonequilibrium processes .",
    "the jarzynski equality is one of these remarkable results .",
    "it shows that a statistical quantity depending on the work @xmath0 performed on a system in contact with a heat reservoir at an inverse temperature @xmath1 during a nonequilibrium process , @xmath2 , is related to the free energy difference @xmath3 between two equilibrium states , which are determined by the initial and final hamiltonians of the system @xcite .",
    "this nonequilibrium relation holds for any intermediate schedule to change the parameter contained in the hamiltonian .",
    "as one of the algorithms in numerical simulations , a practical use of the nonequilibrium relations has been proposed by several researchers @xcite . in the present work , we consider analytical applications of several nonequilibrium relations to spin glasses and establish the fundamental theories in order to overcome difficulties attributed to the critical slowing down in those systems .",
    "we especially apply the nonequilibrium relations to spin glasses with the gauge symmetry for which we can exactly calculate several quantities @xcite . as a result",
    ", we can obtain several exact relations between the nonequilibrium processes for spin glasses starting in a special subspace and the system properties in equilibrium characterized by different parameters from the properties at the starting point .",
    "the present paper consists of five sections . in section 2",
    ", the gauge symmetry of the spin - glass model is reviewed . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the nonequilibrium relations , the jarzynski equality and a more generic theory , the crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "after then , we evaluate the nonequilibrium relations on the nishimori line in section 4 . in the last section ,",
    "we give a summary of the obtained results .",
    "let us consider the following simple spin - glass model , known as the random - bond ising model , whose hamiltonian is @xmath4where @xmath5 is the ising spin taking values @xmath6 .",
    "the summation is taken over all bonds .",
    "one may suppose usual nearest neighboring bonds on a @xmath7-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "we make no restrictions on the type or the dimension of the lattice in the present paper .",
    "we can consider several types of bond distributions for the quenched randomness @xmath8 such as the gaussian distribution .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath8 taking @xmath9 for simplicity .",
    "the following analyses are straightforwardly applied to other cases .",
    "we separate the sign from the interaction @xmath8 as @xmath10 , which takes @xmath6 , below .",
    "we combine the strength @xmath11 of the interactions with the inverse temperature @xmath1 as @xmath12 .",
    "the distribution functions for @xmath10 can be written as @xcite @xmath13where @xmath14 . in the analysis of spin glasses ,",
    "we need to evaluate not only the thermal average as @xmath15 , but also the configurational average @xmath16_{k_{p}}$ ] for @xmath17 as @xmath18 _",
    "{ k_{p}}=\\sum_{\\{\\tau _ { ij}\\}}g(\\{\\tau _ { ij}\\})\\prod_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{k_{p}\\tau _ { ij}}}{2\\cosh k_{p}}.\\ ] ]      here we introduce the gauge transformation in spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the gauge transformations for functions depending on @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined as @xmath21for instance , the instantaneous hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation , while the bond distribution function ( [ p2 ] ) is changed to @xmath22 another important property is the invariance of summation over @xmath23 and @xmath24 , since the gauge transformation merely changes the order of the summation .",
    "here we briefly give the general scheme of the analysis in random - bond ising systems by the gauge transformation .",
    "if we take the configurational average of the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath25 , we find that @xmath26 _ { k_{p}}=\\sum_{\\{\\tau_{ij}\\ } } g(\\{\\tau_{ij}\\ } ) \\prod_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{k_p \\tau_{ij}\\sigma_i \\sigma_j}}{(2 \\cosh k_p)^{n_b } } ,   \\label{ca1}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 expresses the number of bonds .",
    "since the left - hand side of this equation is independent of @xmath28 , the right - hand side is unchanged if we consider other configurations of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the summation over all possible configurations @xmath28 yields the following relation with the coefficient consisting of the partition function with the coupling @xmath29 @xmath26 _ { k_p}=\\sum_{\\{\\tau_{ij}\\ } } g(\\{\\tau_{ij}\\ } ) \\frac{z(k_{p};\\{\\tau_{ij}\\})}{2^{n}\\left(2 \\cosh k_p\\right)^{n_b}},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the number of sites .",
    "the partition function for the random bond ising model is given as @xmath31 using the above properties of the gauge transformation , for instance , we can obtain the exact value of the internal energy on a special subspace @xmath32 , known as the nishimori line ( nl ) , as @xcite @xmath33 _ { k}=-n_{b } j \\tanh k.\\label{enl}\\ ] ] as seen in this equation , the internal energy does not show any singularlities along nl .",
    "we can evaluate an upper bound for the specific heat and some set of equalities and inequalities for the correlation functions on nl in similar ways .",
    "let us consider the case that the system evolves following stochastic dynamics governed by the master equation .",
    "we change the value of the coupling @xmath34 from @xmath35 at @xmath36 to @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , the spin configuration @xmath23 changes .      the original version of the jarzynski equality relates a quantity depending on the performed work during a nonequilibrium isothermal process and the free - energy difference between equilibrium states for the initial and final hamiltonians @xcite . in the original formulation of je",
    ", the work is defined as the energy difference due solely to the change of the hamiltonian , and the heat is described by the energy difference through the change of the degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "we can simply establish a variant version of je in the case of changing the inverse temperature , which is useful in the following application , by defining the work as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the instantaneous energy for the spin configurations @xmath23 given by the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) divided by @xmath11 .",
    "then the jarzynski equality can be written , similarly to the original version of je , as @xmath41 the brackets @xmath42 denote the average over various spin configurations realized in the nonequilibrium process starting from equilibrium at @xmath36 .",
    "we write the probability for the realized spin configurations from the initial spin configuration in equilibrium as @xmath43 by use of the solution of the master equation . the average",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath44where @xmath45 denotes an observable as a function of each realization of the spin configuration in a nonequilibrium process , and the summation extends over instantaneous spin configurations .      the crooks fluctuation theorem , which can be regarded as a more general version of the jarzynski equality @xcite , relates @xmath46 with the probability @xmath47 of the inverse process as @xmath48 this relation yields @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the observable which depends on the backward process @xmath51 .",
    "a simple instance of @xmath45 for the ising spin system is the autocorrelation function @xmath52 .",
    "if we set an observable depending only on the final state , denoted by @xmath53 , instead of @xmath45 , then @xmath50 means an obsevable at the initial state in the backward process .",
    "therefore @xmath54 simply equals to the ordinary thermal average at the initial equilibrium state with the coupling constant @xmath37 as @xmath55 these equations ( [ je1 ] ) , ( [ je2 ] ) and ( [ je3 ] ) can be proven under several formulations for a nonequilibrium process , the master equation , the langevin equation , and the fokker - planck equation .",
    "we have employed the master - equation approach in ref .",
    "@xcite in the following analysis , since it is often used in the numerical simulation of spin glasses . for the analysis of the master equation for ising spin systems , several rules for the dynamics such as metropolis @xcite and glauber dynamics",
    "@xcite are available , but we can prove that the following results are independent of the type of dynamics .",
    "for a fixed bond configuration @xmath24 , we apply the nonequilibrium relation ( [ je3 ] ) to gauge - invariant quantities denoted by @xmath25 . after then , we take the configurational average as follows , @xmath56_{k_{p } }   \\notag \\\\ & & = \\left [ \\langle g(\\{\\tau_{ij}\\})\\rangle_{k_{f}}\\frac{% z(k_{f};\\{\\tau_{ij}\\})}{z(k_{0};\\{\\tau_{ij}\\})}\\right ] _ { k_{p}}.   \\label{gi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the quantity on the left - hand side means the configurational and nonequilibrium - process average of the observation of @xmath57 at the final time @xmath58 , that is after the protocol @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", the quantity on the right - hand side means the configurational and thermal average of the equilibrium state for the final hamiltonian .",
