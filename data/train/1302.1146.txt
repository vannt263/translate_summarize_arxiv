    "the fundamental conceit of this paper is to consider a geometrically - informed deformation retract of the knot space that allows for a complete collapse onto a set of joined surfaces which we call the _",
    "knotspace template _ or simply , the template .",
    "since deformation retracts preserve the homotopy of paths @xcite , the fundamental group in particular will be a topological invariant of this transformation .",
    "on the other hand , homological spectra , relying as they do on cell - complex constructions , will not be preserved under the dimensional collapse , and as a result the template will not be _ strictly _ sensitive to some popular knot invariants that require them , such as floer homology @xcite . however , a simple  re - inflation \" of the polygons of the template into thin rectangular prisms restores the missing dimension in a topology - preserving way and homology may proceed from there .",
    "we shall proceed through the following stages .",
    "first , we will show that the medial set of the knot , which can be evaluated through voronoi procedures , is a proper deformation retract .",
    "second , we shall specialize the construction to a quasi - two - dimensional case , in which we examine a knot diagram having an infinitesimal depth : we shall show that away from the crossings , the medial set coincides with the medial set of the perfectly flat knot graph , and then show that in a small neighborhood of the crossings the medial set is a saddle - like surface cradling the strands , which we can deform into a polygonal saddle .",
    "putting everything together requires a few extra surfaces to compactify the construction , in the shape of an outer ring and a top and a bottom lid .",
    "+ in order to specify the specific deformation retract onto the template we must be able to prescribe a flow from every point of the knot space to a ( possibly branched and faceted ) surface immersed in it",
    ". this surface will be the deformation retract .",
    "voronoi tilings of spaces , a well - worn tool familiar in statistical mechanics @xcite and the mathematics of packings @xcite , offers a conceptual way forward .",
    "imagine that the knotted curve whose knotspace we wish to deformation retract is replaced by an evenly spaced set of points .",
    "note that the voronoi tiling associated with these points will consist of two distinct classes of region boundaries ",
    "those arising from adjacent points along the path of the knot and those arising from non - adjacent points . clearly the boundaries arising from adjacent points do not include information inherent to the knotted curve  as they are generated locally  and may be discarded .",
    "the remaining boundaries comprise a nascent form of the template .",
    "unfortunately , choosing the correct boundaries is algorithmically difficult and indeed , the status of the mapping as a deformation retract is cast into question if there are several extraneous target surfaces that must be ignored .",
    "what is to be done ?",
    "happily , there is a generalization of the voronoi procedure to higher dimensional objects that obviates the need to reduce the knot to a set of points in the first place .",
    "the medial set of geometric analysis @xcite or the spine of manifold recognition algorithms @xcite is this generalization .",
    "such a set is defined in an ambient space of dimension @xmath23 as the locus of @xmath24-ball centers for the set of @xmath24-balls that are tangent to the hypersurface of interest  the knot in our case  in at least two distinct places and do not otherwise internally intersect it .",
    "for complicated curves , the medial set may develop many small spikes and protrusions , but these do not change the topological character of the retract and may be safely pruned .",
    "certainly in the case of distinct points , the procedure for generating the medial set recapitulates the voronoi boundaries , as multiple tangencies ensures the @xmath24-ball center is between voronoi regions and the condition against internal intersection ensures that there is no other closer point s voronoi region to which the @xmath24-ball center should belong .",
    "the specification of the deformation retract map from a closed curve to a surface is straightforward : any point that lies anywhere along a radius associated with a point of multiple tangency is mapped to the center of the corresponding sphere .",
    "all other points are mapped to the surface at infinity .",
    "this map is well - defined as a point can not lie on multiple such radii and continuous as the family of multiply tangent balls can be continuously traversed by inflation or  rolling \" on the curve .",
    "the requirement that points already in the image are stationary is satisfied by construction .",
    "+           + a _ knot _ or _ link diagram _ consists of a planar projection of the knot or link , in which the choice of overpass / underpass is shown diagrammatically as a continuous overpass and an interrupted underpass strand , creating the illusion of an occlusion in 3d .",
    "abstractly , the knot diagram is therefore a planar graph of connectivity four , equipped with a ( boolean ) choice of overpassing strand at each vertex .",
    "( technically , it is often a multigraph , meaning that two nodes may be connected by multiple strands ) .",
    "the number of components in the link or knot is given by the 4-fold graph regardless of the choices of overpass .",
    "evidently there are infinitely many knot diagrams for each knot .",
    "the medial graph of the knot diagram is constructed as a graph abstraction of the pruned medial set ; after inessential pruning and simplification it can be cast into the specific form we shall henceforth use , illustrated for the figure eight knot in figure 1 .",
    "the medial graph is a _ bipartite _",
    "planar graph ; the vertices of one partition are 4-fold vertices identified 1-to-1 with the original vertices of the knot diagram , referred henceforth as the _",
    "fourfolds_. the four edges emanating from these vertices are not identified with the knot strands but rather with the quadrants between them , and hence appear at @xmath25 from the original edges .",
    "the second set of vertices corresponds 1 - 1 with the facets of the original knot diagram ; if the facet is a @xmath26-sided polygon then the corresponding vertex is a @xmath26-fold star , and each of its @xmath26 edges connects with each of the @xmath26 four - fold vertices surrounding the facet .",
    "we call the members of this second partition the _ stars_.    therefore the fourfolds of the medial graph correspond to the original fourfolds of the knot diagram , the stars correspond to the facets of the knot diagram , and the facets of the medial graph correspond to the links ( or strand segments ) of the knot diagram .",
    "it necessarily follows that each link of the medial graph , being the boundary between two facets , corresponds to a way to separate two knot strands from each other .",
    "the fourfolds that lie on the outer boundary of the diagram have one edge emanating towards the outside , in principle to infinity .",
    "we compactify the diagram by surrounding it with a circle representing a star at infinity , on which these outer unbounded edges now terminate .",
    "we will depict the star representing the unbounded outer facet of the knot diagram not as a point but by unraveling it as a circle , though we keep in mind it is a vertex to fully preserve the bipartite structure of the medial graph .    in principle",
    "it is possible to prune this construction further in the case of facets bounded by 1 or 2 edges ; in the first case the vertex of connectivity 1 and its edge can be removed ; in the second case , the edge of connectivity 2 can be removed and the edges impinging on it merged . however , this further pruning destroys the bipartite structure of the medial graph .",
    "not every bipartite planar graph , one of whose partitions consists exclusively of 4-fold vertices , is a valid medial graph of a knot or link diagram .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition is that every facet of the bipartite graph be 4-sided .",
    "it is necessary because the construction of the medial graph makes them so : since every strand segment corresponds to a facet , and strand segments terminate in two fourfolds , facets naturally have two fourfolds and two stars as their boundary vertices .",
    "it is sufficient because when a facet is 4-sided , by the alternating property it necessarily has two fourfolds .",
    "connecting those fourfolds gives back the knot diagram .",
    "( we have glossed over the inconvenient if irrelevant case of a fourfold connected to itself in the knot diagram , removable by a simple reidemeister move ) .",
    "therefore , the set of all valid medial graphs can be expressed in closed form as a bipartite planar graph , one of whose partitions consists of fourfold vertices , and whose facets are all four sided .",
    "using both the medial graph _ and _ the overpass choices of the knot diagram , we can define two graphs called the _ upper _ and _ lower _ graphs .",
    "their vertices are the stars of the medial graph ; their edges are created by removing the fourfolds , connecting together the edges impinging on the fourfold in the usual manner employed in skein diagrams ; more specifically , the two pairs of adjacent edges associated with the underpass are connected for the _ upper _ graph , and the pairs associated with the overpass are connected for the _ lower _ graph .",
    "these two graphs will appear naturally as an important part of our template ; as shown in box 1 , step 3 these graphs trace the intersection of the template with the top and bottom lids .",
    "+ the medial set of a quasi - flat knot coincides , away from the crossings , with the medial set of the flat knot graph ; it is therefore a set of surfaces erected perpendicularly to the medial graph .",
    "the medial graph contains by construction no information about overcross / undercross choice .",
    "but in a small neighborhood of every crossing we need to consider the full impact of the strands in 3d and the choice of overpass . from the previous discussion we may expect that whatever happens with the medial set at these crossings must affect a  hooking together \" of the medial - set planes that result from the knot regions far from a crossing .",
    "we shall now show that the medial set in a neighborhood of a crossing is simply a saddle , which indeed hooks together the pieces of surface already erected and contains the topological information relevant to encoding the overpass / underpass choice at every crossing .",
    "+      let us model such a crossing as a pair of skew lines separated at their closest passing by a small distance , @xmath27 .",
    "in such a scenario , one may find the medial set by imagining a pair of cylindrical sheathes with arbitrarily small radius centered , respectively , on each of the skew lines .",
    "these sheathes radii are then continuously inflated at the same rate and the locus of points over which the two sheathes intersect is the medial set .",
    "the resulting surface is a hyperboloid that cradles the pair of generating skew lines ( fig .",
    "2 ) . note that far from the crossing along a direction in the thin plane containing the lines , this surface twists around to form a set of four vertical half - planes at an angle of @xmath28 to the crossed lines .",
    "these half - planes may then seamlessly connect to the polygonally - generated branches of the medial set discussed above , as required .",
    "meanwhile , very far from the crossing in the direction normal to the thin plane containing the lines the surface manifests as two separate vertical sheets folded through an angle of @xmath29 over a distance comparable to @xmath27 .",
    "these folded sheets are closest to one another at their respective folds , and are separated by a distance , again , comparable to @xmath27 .",
    "which pairing of the four half - planes that are connected by a fold switches above and below the plane of the crossing , correlating with which of the two perpendicular cylinders is farther from the midpoint of the crossing .",
    "+ given a quasi - planar presentation of a knot or unknot the template will always be composed of four distinct regions , examples of which are presented in box 1 .",
    "the first of these , above the plane of the quasi - planar presentation , consists of vertical sheets in the manner of the planar curves with four - fold junctions discussed previously . in this case , however , the sheets do not emanate symmetrically from the junction ( now knot crossing )  rather , each pair of sheets on the same side of the upper section of the knot crossing are smoothly joined together and the pairs of sheets across opposite sides of the upper section of the knot crossing are not connected at all .",
    "the second region of the template is similar to the first , but below the plane of the presentation .",
    "now the vertical sheets are connected in the opposite manner , with the pairs on the same side of the lower section of the knot crossing smoothly joined together and the pairs separated by the lower curve not connected at all .",
    "the third region of the template is the region containing the neighborhood of the plane of the quasi - planar presentation  where the vertical sheets of the first two regions must be joined together . again , away from the knot crossings in this region the template is simply the vertical sheets of the medial sets , as it was in the previous regions .",
    "however , near the knot crossings , the template is saddle shaped , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 . by adopting this shape , the template both correctly captures the region between the crossed strands of the knot and connects to the sheets both above and below the plane of the knot diagram in a way that is consistent with the way the vertical sheets connect or do not connect in the first two regions of the template . finally , the fourth region of the template is the surface at infinity , which may be imagined to be a sphere , or , more usefully , a cylinder or hat box . where the sheets of the first two regions of the template meet the surface at infinity",
    "there is a triple junction .",
    "in addition to the template of the trefoil as shown in box 1 , many other simple examples are easy to produce , such as a trefoil - like unknot , the figure eight knot , a figure - eight - like unknot , and even links , such as the hopf link or the borromean rings ( fig .",
    "we now demonstrate that the template provides a useful route to calculating topological information .",
    "the fundamental group of the knot space , @xmath30 , is an obvious candidate for investigation , as the deformation retract procedure that collapsed the knot space explicitly preserves homotopies .",
    "though @xmath30 is a useful topological invariant , it alone can not fully differentiate knots , as , for example , the knot sum of a square knot and a granny knot has the same fundamental group as the knot sum of a square knot and the mirror of the granny knot , despite these two knot sums producing distinct knots . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 does distinguish prime knots @xcite , and in particular , will distinguish the unknot from a knot .    in order to proceed",
    "we must separate the template into more manageable chunks .",
    "the venerable van kampen theorem @xcite is the appropriate tool for this job , relating the fundamental groups of two open sets whose intersection is connected and whose union is the space of interest .",
    "we settle on three open covering sets ( fig .",
    "4 )  the upper cap set , @xmath31 , covering the top cylindrical cap and all the surface at infinity and vertical planes extending down from the cap almost , but not all the way , to the plane of the knot ; the lower cap set , @xmath32 , covering the bottom cylindrical cap and all the surface at infinity and vertical planes extending up from the cap almost to the plane of the knot ; the mid - band , @xmath33 encompassing the plane of the knot and all the saddle cross - overs and a section of the vertical planes and surface at infinity extending both up and down , but not reaching the cylindrical caps .",
    "for such a choice of covering sets , the intersections are well characterized  in fact , we have already done so ",
    "@xmath34 is a set of vertical planes , open on both vertical ends , whose horizontal cross section is the  upper \" slice of fig .",
    "3 . likewise ,",
    "@xmath35 is a set of open - ended vertical planes with horizontal cross section given by the  lower \" slice of fig .",
    "3 .    we must also make a choice about the pairwise ordering of the sets to be addressed : we will first calculate @xmath36 and then @xmath37 .",
    "hence :    _ 1(k ) _ 1(_template _ ) & & _ 1(c_u b ) _",
    "1(c_l ) / [ ] [ vk1 ] + _ 1(c_u b ) & & _",
    "1(b ) / [ ] . [ vk2 ] where @xmath38 $ ] here is @xmath39 $ ] for @xmath40 the map induced by the inclusion @xmath41 and @xmath42 the two covering sets under that particular application of van kampen .",
    "the square brackets denote conjugacy under homotopy .",
    "we may leverage the same deformation retract procedure that produced the template to make drastic simplifications of the covering sets under consideration .",
    "first , note that the two capping sets , @xmath31 and @xmath32 may be retracted all the way down to a single point , as the vertical sheets may be smoothly retracted back into the cap , and once the cap is all that remains it may be retracted to a point as well .",
    "therefore , we have triviality of the associated fundamental groups :    _ 1(c_u ) _ 1(c_l ) 1 .",
    "furthermore , the intersection bands are more than just characterized by the slices of fig . 3  they deformation retract onto them as well . since those slices are graphs , we immediately have :    _ 1(c_u b ) & & + _ 1(b c_l ) & & where the number of copies of @xmath43 in each fundamental group is given by the number of independent loops in the associated graph @xcite .",
    "we refer to these graphs as the _ upper _ and _ lower graphs _ , respectively .",
    "since these graphs differ only by the connections over / under the knot crossings , the number of these independent loops will be the same for each , and thus @xmath44 .",
    "presentation of the fundamental group * +    [ cols=\">,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , the mid - band set that contains the saddle surfaces that accommodate all of the knot crossings may _ also _ be deformation retracted back onto a graph . in this case , the full @xmath33 begins with sections of vertical planes above and below that match onto the ones of @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , but these sets of planes  twist \" into one another through the saddle - populated mid - plane of the set . in the same way that an  x \" shape is a limiting case of hyperbolae , pulling the vertical planes back toward the mid - plane from above and below ultimately leaves a solid connection , shaped like an  x \" , at each knot crossing .",
    "@xmath33 is thus homotopic to the bounded medial graph of box 1 and :    _ 1(b ) where now there are twice as many copies of @xmath43 as in the case of the intersections , since one may view the creation of the solid connection between all four branches at a knot crossing as splitting every loop in either of the graphs associated with the intersections in two .",
    "what are the implications of these simplifications for the inclusion - induced maps needed to form the quotient space ? some of the sets involved in these inductions have now been shown to have trivial fundamental groups , and therefore some of the associated @xmath45s will be trivial as well .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , all elements must be mapped to the identity , since that is all that exists in the trivial target group . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are hence both homotopic to the null path and in the conjugacy class of the identity .    with these reductions in hand we may now re - examine eqs .",
    "[ vk1 ] and [ vk2 ] : _",
    "1(k ) _ 1(_template _ ) & & _ 1(c_u b ) / [ i_bc_l ( ) ] + _",
    "1(c_u b ) & & _",
    "1(b ) / [ i_bc_u ( ) ] . or , in other words , @xmath49 is isomorphic to the free group of @xmath50 copies of @xmath43 modulo the generators of the free groups associated with each of the two intersection regions , where @xmath24 is the number of generators for each of the intersection regions ( free ) fundamental groups .",
    "example calculations for @xmath49 for the trefoil knot and a trefoil - like presentation of the unknot are given in box 2 .",
    "these example calculations for the group presentation have an evident dissimilarity in the spread of the length of each relation .",
    "while the average number of symbols in all presentations remains the same ( 18 ) , and therefore the average word length is constant , the unknot has much bigger variance , from which the likelihood of having relations of length 1 that simplify immediately is larger .",
    "the chances that a randomly presented group will unravel like the presentation of the unknot is related to the length of the presentations @xcite ; it follows from some deep results of gromov that this probability is governed by a logarithmically measured density of the relations in the space of all words @xcite . in our case",
    "this implies that we should measure not the algebraic mean of the word length , but the geometric mean of word lengths .",
    "evidently , for the trefoil this number is still @xmath6 , but for the presentation of the unknot we obtain @xmath51 .",
    "this motivates us to define the _ presentation complexity _ of a knot as the geometric mean of the number of letters in its group s presentation as defined here . because the convexity of the logarithm implies that for a given algebraic mean the geometric mean is highest when there is a minimal variance , the presentational complexity is highest for alternating presentations .",
    "we have shown that all the topological information carried by the knotspace , and some interesting geometry besides can be condensed into a lower dimensional object , the template .",
    "we derived a novel , geometric presentation of the fundamental group based on the template .",
    "conversely , the template gives us a fairly closed - form fashion in which _ every knotspace _ can be represented : the template can be explicitly described as a set of polygons erected over the edges of the medial graph , plus saddles ( in one of two choices ) on the four - fold vertices , and the medial graph itself can be characterised in closed form as a bipartite planar graph with square facets and a partition of four - fold vertices .",
    "owing to the geometric simplicity of the construction and the fact that the number of polygons required is linear in @xmath0 , we believe that our template is the ideal tool for analyzing complicated , tangled , possibly knotted curves and links that have begun to pique interest in multiple disciplines , from polymer science to biophysics , such as linked and knotted dna , to the study of photonic phase fields and beyond",
    ". meanwhile , on the purely knot - theoretic side of the ledger , that same algorithmic simplicity and added geometric information , together with the results of several low-@xmath0 trials provide hope for a possibly sub - exponential - time solution to the unknotting problem .",

    "<S> , one generator may be used to replace the other and again a generator vanishes from the algebra . </S>",
    "<S> computationally the worst possible scenario is thus when all relationships have exactly 3 or 4 letters , satisfying the average without giving rise to simple cancellations or replacements : this happens only when the knot is alternating . </S>",
