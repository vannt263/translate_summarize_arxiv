    "cnts are grown on oxidized silicon substrates using methane - based chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) and ferric nitrate catalyst nanoparticles .",
    "the growth recipe adopted has been shown to produce mostly single - wall cnts of both semiconducting and metallic chiralities @xcite , although this has not been independently verified for the current work .",
    "following growth , cnt substrates are imaged with a commercial afm ( asylum research , mfp-3d ) using gold - coated probes ( budgetsensors , multi75-gb ) , and vertically oriented cnt whiskers can be lifted off the substrate by adhering to the sidewalls of the afm probe .",
    "the mechanistic details of the pickup process are not fully understood , although experimental and theoretical studies suggest that relatively large diameter cnts ( 3 - 5 nm ) are more likely to attach due to the increased cnt - probe interfacial area @xcite .",
    "following pickup , the cnt length is measured by pressing the cnt against a smooth si substrate while measuring the deflection of the afm cantilever ( force curve ) .",
    "when the distal end of the cnt touches the substrate , the cantilever initially begins to deflect .",
    "as more force is applied , the cnt will elastically buckle and the cantilever deflection relaxes somewhat resulting in a kink in the approach curve . depending on its length , a number of additional kinks are possible until finally the apex of the afm probe comes into contact with the substrate after which a linear deflection of the cantilever is observed as the tip is further pressed into the substrate . the measured distance between the first kink and the linear onset gives the cnt length . when initially attached",
    ", cnts are generally too long to possess sufficient axial stiffness for use in afm imaging and thus they must be shortened to @xmath10200 nm .",
    "this is achieved by application of short ( @xmath810 @xmath45s ) voltage pulses of 10 v amplitude between the afm probe and a doped si substrate .",
    "these pulses induce electrochemical etching of the distal end of the cnt , which leads to shortening in quasi - controllable steps of 10 - 15 nm and removes any fullerene or catalyst cap . in these experiments",
    ", no attempt was made to successively shorten a particular cnt between fluorescence measurements .",
    "rather , each cnt was used for a series of measurements until it was irreversibly damaged or lost .",
    "the lengths of the cnts utilized extended from 50 to 165 nm , which is approximately the usable range for these types of measurements .",
    "the experimental setup is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , the afm is coupled to a homebuilt inverted optical microscope , which features a 1.4 na oil - immersion objective , a single - photon counting avalanche photodiode ( apd ) module ( perkin elmer , spcm - aqr14 ) , and a green he - ne laser ( @xmath46 nm ) . a key element in the setup is a laser beam mask whose transmission profile is a @xmath47 annular section .",
    "the inner diameter of the annular section blocks all subcritical rays , resulting in a purely evanescent field at the sample interface within an elongated ( 1.5 @xmath48 0.5 @xmath45m@xmath49 ) focal area . by rotating the linear polarization of the laser beam",
    ", the polarization of the evanescent field can be adjusted to be either vertical ( i.e. , along the cnt axis ) or horizontal ( i.e. , in the plane of the sample ) .",
    "the qds employed are nominally 4 nm in diameter and 9 nm long and have an emission maximum at a wavelength of @xmath8605 nm ( invitrogen , qdot605 itk ) . after diluting in toluene to a concentration of @xmath810@xmath50 m , 50 @xmath45l of the qd solution was then pipetted onto a cleaned and etched glass coverslip and left to dry in a laminar flow hood .",
    "the final surface density of qds on the coverslip was @xmath100.1 @xmath45m@xmath51 .",
    "with such a low qd surface density , it is easy to locate isolated qds using the afm topography .      when a qd becomes charged , its quantum yield is reduced significantly because subsequently excited excitons can be non - radiatively quenched via an auger recombination process @xcite .",
    "this is , in fact , related to the probable mechanism for qd blinking @xcite : an exciton s electron or hole can become trapped in a localized defect state ( e.g. , dangling bonds ) at the surface , leaving a residual charge in the core @xcite . in blinking , the quantum yield will remain low ( off ) until the trapped charge recombines in the core , upon which it returns to a high ( on ) value .",
    "histograms of the persistence times for both the `` on '' and `` off '' states will typically exhibit a power - law dependence on time , with an exponent of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , if a charge transfer event between the qd and an approaching cnt occurred , the blinking statistics should be altered inasmuch as the neutralization time is slower than the bin time ( inverse sample rate ) .",
    "figure s1 shows a comparison between the on and off persistence times for a particular qd when a cnt is oscillating directly above it during an energy transfer measurement , and when the cnt is not present . to facilitate comparison of the histograms ,",
    "the cnt data has been multiplied by an appropriate factor , which vertically shifts the data on the log - log scale : no discernible difference between the power - law distributions is observed .",
    "the tip oscillation period in this case is @xmath815 @xmath45s , so there are many tip oscillations per 1 ms time bin .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for charge transfer in these measurements , assuming the neutralization time is longer than the 1 ms .",
    "the symmetric shape of the approach curves provides additional evidence against charge transfer . as described in the text and in previous work @xcite , these approach curves are acquired while the cnt - tip oscillates above the qd with a frequency of @xmath870 khz .",
    "the detected photons are time - tagged and initially correlated with the instantaneous tip oscillation phase , and these phases are subsequently mapped to the instantaneous height of the tip using the calibrated tip oscillation amplitude .",
    "thus , the measured approach curves contain information on both the approach and retraction of the cnt tip towards and away from the sample surface .",
    "if a charge transfer event occurred as a cnt approached the qd , the qd would go dark for some period until the qd charge was neutralized , leading to an asymmetric shape of the approach curve .",
    "note that large asymmetries in some approach curves are sometimes observed ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "s4 below ) , but we interpret these as resulting from cnt buckling . either way , none of the data analyzed exhibited such asymmetry , so we conclude that there is no charge transfer if the neutralization time is longer than the tip - oscillation period , or @xmath88 @xmath45s . since our qds sit atop a non - conductive glass substrate , and since the experiments are performed in a relatively low humidity environment ( @xmath1010@xmath53 ) , neutralization times shorter than this",
    "are not expected .",
    "the modified frster model developed in the text predicts a signal of the form : @xmath54 ^ 6\\right]^{-1}. \\label{s2}\\ ] ] equation ( [ s2 ] ) assumes that the fluorescence signal is properly normalized to the far - field value ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , and that the detected signal is due purely to an interaction between the qd and cnt .",
    "however , it has been shown that metal tips can also quench fluorescence at short distances and can also modify the local optical intensity at the qd at distances up to @xmath8200 nm @xcite .",
    "since the shortest cnt used in our study was 50 nm long , we are only interested the long - range effects and can neglect quenching .",
    "in particular , as it approaches the qd , the gold tip to which a cnt is attached suppresses the fluorescence signal , as seen in fig .",
    "due to the long length scale for this effect , we believe it results from a reduction in the local intensity at the qd caused by interference between the excitation light and the light scattered off the tip , rather than from energy transfer from the qd to the gold tip . the scattering from the tip is expected to be stronger for vertically polarized light compared to horizontal polarization , which leads to the longer decay length seen in fig .",
    "the approach curves in fig .",
    "s2 for both vertical and horizontal polarization are described well by an exponential decay function , @xmath56 , for @xmath57 nm . thus , to account for the gold - induced intensity suppression , the approach - curve data for cnt tips was first fit to @xmath58 , where @xmath27 is the measured length of the specific cnt , and the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are extracted from the fit .",
    "only data in the range @xmath61 nm are used in the fit , since in this range the contribution from the cnt is smaller than that from the gold .",
    "the measured signal is then normalized by the contribution of the gold for the entire range of the measurement : @xmath62 .",
    "there are two primary possibilities that could lead to a polarization dependence in the cnt approach curve measurements .",
    "first , direct scattering of the excitation light by the cnt should lead to field enhancement at the cnt terminus via the lightning - rod effect when the polarization is parallel to the cnt axis . for transverse polarization",
    ", no field enhancement should result and in fact a reduction in excitation intensity might occur .",
    "secondly , if the emission dipole orientation of the qd is correlated with its absorption dipole , then @xmath20 should depend on the excitation polarization direction via the dipole - dipole orientation overlap factor .",
    "the data presented in the manuscript was composed of many measurements with both axial and transverse polarization directions and no systematic difference was observed . to demonstrate this , fig .",
    "s3 shows the measured values of peak quenching efficiency ( at @xmath25 ) and the quenching decay length for each cnt and both polarization directions .",
    "the decay length is the measured tip - sample separation at half the peak quenching efficiency .",
    "occasionally , we observe obvious asymmetry in the shape of an approach curve , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , asymmetric approach curves correlate strongly with poor afm performance across the entire sample , not just above a qd .",
    "thus , we interpret such data as resulting from buckling of the cnt while the cantilever oscillates during intermittent contact mode afm imaging .",
    "it is important to recall that all the measurements are obtained in this mode and that the approach curves are acquired by correlating the arrival times of the detected photons with the instantaneous phase of the tip oscillation .",
    "thus , if the cnt buckles as the cantilever swings through its downward trajectory ( i.e. toward the sample surface ) , then upon retraction , it will elastically unbuckle at some point and lift away from the surface .",
    "as is often observed for normal afm tips , the cnt is likely to adhere to the surface upon retraction , until the cantilever spring constant overwhelms the adhesion forces , at which point the cnt will release from the surface .",
    "this causes an asymmetry in the phase histogram and associated approach curve : the approach side of the curve exhibits a smooth decay in the fluorescence with a shape characteristic of a normal ( non - buckled ) measurement , while the retraction side of the curve is more steep .",
    "in addition , there is a flat bottom to the approach curve corresponding to the duration of time during which the cnt is in a buckled state , and apparently some portion of the cnt is in direct contact with the qd .",
    "occasionally the flat portion of the approach curve exhibits more complicated features , which presumably correspond to the cnt tip sliding away from the qd location .",
    "in addition , we observe a higher rate of buckling with larger tip - oscillation amplitudes and harder tapping ( lower set point for the oscillation amplitude relative to the free amplitude ) , and a corresponding increase in the width of the flat portion of the approach curve .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with eugene mishchenko and dane mccamey .",

    "<S> ( [ forster ] ) implies that even for a specific cnt , the position dependence of @xmath11 will vary from one qd to another , and also for a particular qd during fluorescence blinking and/or oxidation - induced decay . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to recognize that for every photoexcitation cycle , the qd will relax either via intrinsic processes _ or _ via energy transfer to the cnt . </S>",

    "<S> stronger coupling between the qd and cnt results in a larger value of @xmath20 , which increases the probability for generating an exciton further up the tube . </S>",

    "<S> the strong agreement between this simple calculation and the measurements lends confidence to our interpretation of the data .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , despite the strength of the qd - cnt coupling , the correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath24 causes the energy transfer efficiency to saturate at @xmath25 , in contrast to the fret efficiency between two point dipoles , which diverges at zero separation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the simple analysis above predicts that the energy transfer efficiency , @xmath34 , should saturate at a value of @xmath35 , independent of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b ) shows a stacked histogram for the _ measured _ values of the energy transfer efficiency at @xmath25 for each cnt . </S>",
    "<S> there is no obvious dependence of these measurements on cnt length and importantly , the peak energy transfer efficiency for every cnt is consistent with the predicted value of 0.96 . despite the large dynamic range in @xmath20 , which reflects variations in qd - cnt coupling strength , </S>",
    "<S> the peak energy transfer efficiency is tightly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of this self - limiting behavior is that the peak energy transfer efficiency should be largely independent of cnt chirality , qd - cnt spectral overlap , and the precise alignment of the qd and cnt transition dipole moments . since it is still very difficult to selectively grow or separate cnts based on their chiralities , this point may be crucial in terms of using qd - cnt composites for light - harvesting applications .    to enhance our interpretation of the measurements , </S>",
    "<S> a number of possible systematic effects were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> first , under these conditions , gold - coated tips decrease the local illumination intensity when they are between @xmath830 and @xmath8200 nm above the sample @xcite . to account for this </S>",
    "<S> , intensity profiles were measured using bare gold - coated tips , and proper normalization functions for the data were generated ( supplementary figure s2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this normalization procedure yields a larger uncertainty for shorter cnts , resulting in a broader distribution of measured quenching efficiencies , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> at very short range , a gold - coated tip can increase the local illumination intensity ( for vertical polarization ) , and can also quench the fluorescence emission directly , but since the shortest cnt in our study is 50 nm long , these effects can be neglected . optical scattering from the cnt itself </S>",
    "<S> might also modify the illumination intensity and/or the qd radiative rate @xmath15 , particularly for vertically polarized illumination . </S>",
    "<S> no dependence of the measurements on polarization direction is observed ( supplementary figure s3 ) , and indeed the data summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 contain many measurements using each polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that any cnt - induced modification to the illumination intensity or @xmath15 is either too weak or too confined near the cnt terminus to be detected at the qd core , and also that the emission dipole moment of the qd is not correlated with the excitation polarization . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is possible for a cnt to buckle under a compressive axial load , such as applied during afm imaging . indeed , buckling events lead to easily detectable asymmetry in the shape of measured approach curves , since these contain information corresponding to both the approach and retraction of the cnt during its oscillation cycle ( supplementary figure s4 ) , and also correlate strongly with poor afm performance . </S>",
    "<S> none of the measurements summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 exhibit the signatures of buckling .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to recognize that each cnt in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 was used to measure several individual qds , each of which likely had a different intrinsic quantum yield , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> such differences should cause @xmath20 to vary in proportion to @xmath36{q_0}$ ] ( eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ forster ] ) ) , while @xmath20 is not sensitive to disparities in the absorption cross section from one qd to another since the fluorescence data are normalized in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to variations between qds , oxidative damage can decrease @xmath21 for a particular qd as it ages under ambient conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(a ) shows a sample of four approach curves for a particular qd as it ages over a period of @xmath820 minutes during which a constant illumination intensity was maintained . </S>",

    "<S> 4(b ) are the values of @xmath20 extracted from all the measurements during this time as a function of the far - field photon count rate , @xmath37 , and a solid line that is proportional to @xmath36{c_0}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a reduction in the absorption cross - section @xcite for long aging times ( i.e. , small values of @xmath37 ) would tend to push the data to the left of this line , in agreement with the measurements .    [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : die ]    despite the strong correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath37 , the energy transfer efficiency saturates at @xmath80.96 ; indeed these data are a subset of those plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) plots the ratio @xmath38 , which is very sensitive to minute variations when @xmath11 becomes small ( i.e. , near @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable consistency of the saturation value leads to the important conclusion that as @xmath22 increases during aging ( due to an increase in @xmath16 ) , the peak energy transfer rate @xmath39 increases proportionally . in fret experiments between two point dipoles </S>",
    "<S> , a smaller value of @xmath20 indicates weaker coupling between the donor and acceptor , generally implying a smaller energy transfer rate . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , the one - dimensional nature of the cnt leads to a different interpretation : _ smaller _ values of @xmath20 yield _ higher _ average energy transfer rates upon repeated excitation cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because when @xmath20 is small , the effective center of mass of the exciton distribution within the cnt , @xmath40 , is _ closer _ to the end of the cnt and thus closer to the qd , which elevates the _ average _ energy transfer rate . within this context </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum possible energy transfer rate should occur in the limit that all acceptor excitons are created as close to the qd as possible ; i.e. , at the tip of the cnt . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a minimum dipole - dipole separation @xmath41 nm : 2 nm for the radius of the qd and @xmath421 nm for the exciton radius in the cnt . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath20 becomes smaller than about @xmath43 , then the exciton center of mass can not adjust toward the cnt tip any further . beyond this point </S>",
    "<S> , the energy transfer rate can not become any larger and the energy transfer efficiency will decrease . evidently , the slow degradation in @xmath21 for the qd in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 is not sufficient to achieve these conditions and the energy transfer efficiency maintains a saturation value of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> dark states that occur during blinking can have sufficiently small values of @xmath21 , however , leading to reduced energy transfer efficiency ( e.g. , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) )    in conclusion , we have made high - precision measurements of energy transfer from qds to cnts and have developed a simple model based on dipole - dipole coupling between excitons to explain the observed behavior . due to the one - dimensional nature of the cnt </S>",
    "<S> , the data exhibit novel features that depart from classical frster theory for energy transfer between point dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we observe a strong correlation between the measured length scale ( @xmath20 ) for efficient energy transfer and the average position of the exciton generated within the cnt ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a narrow distribution of the peak energy transfer efficiency and a counterintuitive increase in the energy transfer rate for smaller values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , both the model and measurements suggest that the peak energy transfer efficiency should be independent of cnt chirality , which has important implications with regard to the development of qd - cnt composite materials for light - harvesting applications . </S>"
