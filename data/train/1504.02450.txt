    "computing the electromagnetic ( em ) form factors in the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite requires the solutions of the bs equation in minkowski space .",
    "the main reason is that the wick rotation @xcite , which allows to go from minkowski to euclidean space in the bs equation , can not be performed in the integral expression of the em form factor ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the euclidean case , finding the minkowski space solution is complicated by the many singularities in the integrand of the bs equation and in the amplitude itself . in the recent years , and using different independent methods , these difficulties have been overcome and an important progress was achieved .    in one of these methods",
    "@xcite , the kernel of the bs equation is approximately represented in a separable form .",
    "this allows to considerably advance analytically and therefore simplifies finding the solution .    in the method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite the bs amplitude is represented as an integral over a weight function @xmath1  the so called nakanishi transform @xcite  which satisfies a nonsingular equation . a modification of this method , based on the light - front projection of the bs amplitude ,",
    "was developed in @xcite and used to find the bound state minkowski bs amplitude .",
    "the elastic em form factor was also calculated in @xcite .",
    "an equation for the nakanishi function for the scattering states was derived @xcite .",
    "another method @xcite is based on the direct solution in minkowski space of the bs equation after an appropriate treatment of singularities .",
    "the scattering problem was there solved and the off - mass shell scattering amplitude first computed .",
    "once reduced to the mass shell , the latter reproduces the phase shifts .",
    "taken off - mass shell , it allows to calculate the electrodisintegration of the bound system , i.e. the form factor of the transition bound to scattering state .    an important contribution to this form factor , incorporating the final state interaction ( fsi ) , is given by the feynman graph shown in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the right and left vertices in this graph are just the minkowski bs amplitudes for the bound ( left ) and scattering ( right ) states .",
    "if both vertices correspond to a bound state ( case of the elastic form factor ) , the nakanishi transform allows to calculate the 4d feynman integral corresponding to fig . [ triangle ]",
    "( left panel ) , with an integrand containing three singular propagators , analytically @xcite . then the non - singular integral with the weight functions @xmath1",
    "is safely calculated numerically . for the scattering state , though the nakanishi transform also exists @xcite , the corresponding weight function @xmath1 at positive energies is not yet computed .",
    "note , however , that very recently @xmath1 was found in the zero - energy limit that allowed to calculate the scattering length @xcite . without using the nakanishi representation",
    "the scattering state vertex can be obtained only numerically @xcite and therefore the singular 4d feynman integral corresponding to fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ( left panel ) must be computed numerically as well .",
    "this calculation , providing the transition electromagnetic current and the form factor , requires however some care to take properly into account the pole singularities of the propagators .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give the detail of the first results presented in @xcite and analyze the conservation of the calculated electromagnetic current in the inelastic transition .",
    "we will see that this current is indeed conserved , as it should be from general principles @xcite .",
    "however this conservation is due to a rather delicate cancellation between the plane wave ( pw ) contribution ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ) and the final state interaction ( left panel of fig . [ triangle ] ) which requires a strict consistency between , on one hand , the bound and scattering state solutions and , on the other hand , the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "it thus provides a strong test for all these quantities simultaneously .",
    "the need for an internal consistency between states , currents and dynamical equation to ensure the gauge invariance was extensively discussed in @xcite in the framework of the bs and the gross spectator equations .",
    "our numerical results are in agreement with this general expectation",
    ". we will show that if this consistency and hence the gauge invariance is violated , a consequence of that is not only the appearance of a non - conserved part in the current  which anyway drops out in the cross section  but that the current as a whole is not valid at all .",
    "in other words , the transition form factors extracted from the conserved part of the non - conserved current , are also deficient .    in order to illustrate our treatment of the singularities",
    ", we will restrict to the spinless particles .",
    "the generalization to the fermion case is straightforward since the fermion and scalar propagators have the same singularities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tff ]",
    "we discuss the decomposition of the transition current in the form factors without assuming the current conservation . in sections",
    "[ fsi ] and [ pwc ] , the fsi and pw contributions in the conserved part of the current are calculated .",
    "section [ conserv ] is devoted to the discussion of the current conservation .",
    "in particular , the fsi and pw contributions of the non - conserved part of the current have been calculated and we have shown that they cancel each other .",
    "some selected numerical results are presented in section [ numerics ] .",
    "section [ concl ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "the cumbersome details of the calculations are given in the appendices [ frame ] , [ app1 ] and [ app_pw ] .",
    "in the case of spinless particles , and without supposing the current conservation , the general form of the electromagnetic current involves two form factors : @xmath2 the decomposition ( [ jf1f2 ] ) , together with the scalar character of the constituents , implies that the initial and final states have total zero angular momenta , i.e. that they are composed of s - waves only .    in order to study the current conservation ,",
    "it is convenient to redefine the form factors by introducing the following linear combinations @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xmath7 is the initial bound state mass , @xmath8 is the invariant mass of the final scattering state . in terms of them ,",
    "the current ( [ jf1f2 ] ) can be rewritten in the form : @xmath9f(q^2)- ( p'_{\\mu}-p_{\\mu})\\frac{q_c^2}{q^2}f'(q^2)\\ ] ] since @xmath10 the current conservation @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "notice that in the elastic case the form factor @xmath4 is absent since the term in ( [ ffc ] ) is forbidden by the symmetry between initial and final states .",
    "notice also that the form factor @xmath13 , even if it is not zero , does not contribute to the electrodisintegration amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , this amplitude is given by : @xmath15 it contains the electron spinors @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "substituting here the current ( [ ffc ] ) and using the dirac equation , we see that the term containing @xmath13 drops out since @xmath18    below we will calculate each of these form factors  @xmath3 and @xmath4  as a sum of fsi ( left panel in fig . [ triangle ] ) and pw ( right panel in fig . [ triangle ] ) contributions , in the form : @xmath19 we will check that the full current is conserved , that is , for any @xmath20 , the contributions to @xmath21 of the fsi and pw cancel each other : @xmath22 provided the bound and scattering states are solutions of the bs equation with the one - boson exchange kernel . in this case , the em current corresponding to the interaction of a photon with a constituent is free .",
    "we are however interested in a quantitative measure of the accuracy of this cancellation in a real calculation .",
    "this is the reason for introducing in ( [ ffc ] ) the non - conserved part  proportional to @xmath23  and the value of the form factor @xmath13 will give us this measure .",
    "we will calculate separately the fsi and pw contributions to the form factor @xmath13 and see with what accuracy they cancel each other in the sum ( [ fpq2 ] ) .",
    "we start with the fsi contribution . it is obtained by applying the feynman rules to the left panel graph of fig . [ triangle ] and has the form ( following the convention of @xcite ) : @xmath24 [ ( p'-k)^2-m^2+i\\epsilon]},\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is the initial ( bound state ) vertex and @xmath26 is the final vertex ( half - off - shell scattering bs amplitude ) .",
    "as mentioned , both vertex functions were found numerically by solving the s - wave bs equation in @xcite .",
    "more precisely the function @xmath26 is related to the scattering wave solution @xmath27 by eq .",
    "( [ gf0 ] ) from appendix [ appb4 ] .",
    "the integrals of the type ( [ ffin0 ] ) are usually calculated by applying to the product of propagators the feynman parametrization and then performing the wick rotation . however , besides the product of propagators , expression ( [ ffin0 ] ) contains the initial ( @xmath25 ) and final ( @xmath26 ) bs amplitudes which are known numerically .",
    "therefore the feynman parametrization can not be applied and we should calculate this 4d singular integral numerically , though after some transformations .",
    "it is convenient to carry out this calculations in the system of reference where @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are collinear , i.e. they either are parallel or anti - parallel to each other , depending on the kinematical conditions . in the elastic case it coincides with the breit frame @xmath32 and , one has of course @xmath33 , @xmath28 . in the inelastic case , in the frame with @xmath28 we have @xmath34 .",
    "some useful kinematical relations valid in this reference system are given in appendix [ frame ] .",
    "in this reference frame we take the zero component of the current ( [ ffc ] ) and get the relation : @xmath35 that is : @xmath36 [ ( p_0-k_0)^2-\\varepsilon_{\\vec{p'}-\\vec{k}}^2+i\\epsilon]}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 and similar expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 obtained using ( [ pmk2 ] ) and ( [ ppmk2 ] ) .    as detailed in the appendix [ appb4 ] , in case of initial and final s - waves ,",

    "the product of three delta - functions does not contribute since their arguments can not be zero simultaneously .",
    "these functions @xmath56 have the following explicit form : @xmath57 the index of @xmath56 ( @xmath58 ) denotes the number of the principal value products that involves .",

    "part of this integration is calculated analytically and the remaining part , once transformed into a non - singular integrand , numerically .    for calculating the singular principal value integrals in @xmath53 we will use the subtraction technique .",
    "that is , we subtract and add to @xmath53 an appropriately chosen singular function @xmath60 which , in variable @xmath61 has the same poles as @xmath53 and has no any other singularities : @xmath62 in the difference @xmath63 , the pole singularities cancel each other and the result is a smooth function , whereas in the additional term @xmath60 the integral over @xmath64 is calculated analytically .    after this calculation , there still remains a singular expression in variable @xmath65 .",

    "must be taken into account .",
    "in other words , in an interacting system , the true current is , in general , not the free one .",
    "for example , for the kernel given by the sum of ladder and cross - ladder , the full em current should contain , in addition to the two ( free ) contributions displayed in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , the cross - ladder fsi contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ cr_lad ] and similar cross - ladder contribution for the plane wave ( we suppose the exchanged particle to be neutral ) .",

    "[ triangle ] provide the only contributions to the current .",
    "therefore , the current determined by these two graphs has to be conserved if the initial and final bs amplitudes are also obtained with the ladder kernel . at the same time , the expressions for the contributions ( [ ffin0 ] ) and ( [ pw2 ] ) to the current in terms of the bs amplitudes are universal  they are the same for any bs amplitude ( found with any kernel ) .",

    "the value of @xmath13 will be rather compared to @xmath117 and the current conservation would manifest itself in the fact that @xmath118 for any value of @xmath20 .",
    "as an example , we have calculated the transition form factor for the initial ( bound ) state binding energy @xmath119 ( initial state mass @xmath120 ) and for two values of the final ( scattering ) state relative momentum @xmath121 and @xmath122 with corresponding final state masses @xmath123 values @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "their cancellation takes place provided both bs amplitudes  the bound and the scattering one  as well as the current operator are consistent with each other , i.e. if they are correctly found in the same dynamics .    to illustrate how a violation of this consistency would affect the current conservation",

    "we have presented the first results of the transition electromagnetic form factor for the electrodisintegration of a two - body bound system described by the bethe - salpeter equation in minkowski space .",

    "we have shown that , provided the bound and scattering state bethe - salpeter amplitudes as well as the operator of em current are consistent with each other , the electromagnetic current is conserved .",
    "if this consistency is destroyed , the conservation is violated .",
    "this violation has two consequences .",
    "first , the decomposition of the current in form factors obtains an additional contribution ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ ffc ] ) ) which does not satisfy the equality @xmath0 .",
    "however , the appearance of this term itself does not make any influence on observables  it does not contribute in the scattering amplitude  due to conservation of the electromagnetic current of the incident electron .",
    "second , and most important , is the fact that the non - conservation of the calculated current makes it physically meaningless .",
    "one can not extract from a deficient current a reliable transition form factor .",
    "it is thus mandatory , in practical calculations , like e.g. in the deuteron electrodisintegration , to check the current conservation .",
    "if the form factor , responsible for non - conservation of the current , turns out to be comparable with the physical ones , one can hardly trust the calculated physical form factors too .    the widely used recipe , consisting in replacing the non - conserved current @xmath180 by the conserved combination @xmath181 hides the problem but does not solve it .",
    "this combination @xmath182 satisfies tautologically the current conservation for any @xmath180 , not only for the correct one and thus offers no any guarantee to the result . with an incorrect current , one can not find the correct transition form factor , neither from @xmath180 nor from @xmath182 .",
    "the current conservation appears as a numerically subtle phenomenon since it manifests itself as a cancellation of large contributions : fsi and pw . to see it",
    "unambiguously , the solution of the bs equation should be found with high enough precision .",
    "as mentioned in sec . [ tff ] , it is convenient to carry out these calculations in the system of reference where @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 . in the elastic case it coincides with the breit frame @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath28 .",

    ", one can also make the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 collinear , i.e. either parallel or anti - parallel , so that @xmath190 is equal either to @xmath191 ( if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parallel ) or @xmath192 ( if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are anti - parallel ) , depending on the @xmath20 value .",

    "the scattered system moves in the opposite direction than the incoming one and this is the only possibility to get a non - zero momentum transfer .    in the inelastic case @xmath197 , still in the reference frame with @xmath28 and with the collinear momenta @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( now with @xmath198 but @xmath199 ) , there exists a critical momentum transfer @xmath200 . if the momentum transfer @xmath20 is smaller that @xmath200 , it is not enough to change the direction of initial momentum @xmath30 into the opposite one . in this kinematics , the final momentum @xmath31 after collision remains parallel to @xmath30 , though with @xmath70 smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "however , for @xmath201 the final momentum @xmath31 changes its direction relative to @xmath30 like in the elastic collision .",
    "that is , when @xmath20 increases , the final momentum @xmath31 , being first parallel to @xmath30 , vanishes and appears again in a direction opposite to @xmath30 .",
    "when it crosses zero @xmath73 ( provided @xmath28 ) , the corresponding momentum transfer is @xmath202 .",
