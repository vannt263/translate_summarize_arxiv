    "<S> several theoretical proposals have been made for spin liquid phases and spin - liquid - like behaviors on the stacked triangular lattice . while the crystal structures of these materials are currently under debate , it is nonetheless interesting to understand possible spin liquid phases on such frustrated lattices . in this work , we apply schwinger boson mean - field theory and projective symmetry group ( psg ) analysis to investigate spin liquid phases on the fully three - dimensional 6h - b structure , in contrast to previous works that considered two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a nematic @xmath3 spin liquid phase , where the lattice - rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken , is the most promising spin liquid phase that is consistent with spiral magnetic ordering in the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results to future theoretical and experimental works . </S>"
