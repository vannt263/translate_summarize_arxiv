    "though the standard model(sm ) does an excellent job at describing precision electroweak data@xcite there are many reasons to believe that new physics must exist at a scale not far above that which is currently being probed at colliders .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , the mssm , provides a setting for addressing a number of important questions left unanswered by the sm framework .",
    "although convenient for many analyses due to its relative simplicity , no one truly expects that the mssm will represent the actual version of susy realized by nature at low energies .",
    "perhaps one of the simplest and well motivated extensions of the mssm scenario is the enlargement of the sm gauge group , @xmath12 , by additional @xmath13 or @xmath14 factors . from the gut or string point of view",
    ", the presence at low energies , @xmath15  tev , of an additional neutral gauge boson , @xmath0 , associated with a @xmath16 seems reasonably likely@xcite . at a high energy scale ,",
    "such a @xmath0 could arise naturally from , for example , the breaking of real or ersatz gut such as @xmath2 or @xmath1 via patterns such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 , with some linear combination of the @xmath14 s surviving unbroken down to the tev scale .",
    "if such particles are indeed present they must either be reasonably massive , have small mixings with the sm @xmath19 , and/or have ` unlucky ' combinations of fermionic couplings in order to avoid direct searches at the tevatron@xcite and potential conflict with precision electroweak data@xcite .",
    "one ` unlucky ' set of couplings that has gotten much attention in the literature is the condition know as leptophobia@xcite , , where the @xmath0 does not couple to sm leptons .",
    "in such a situation the @xmath0 avoids traditional collider searches since it can not be produced in drell - yan collisions and it does not perturb any of the leptonic coupling data collected at lep through asymmetry measurements or the value of @xmath20 obtained by sld . to discover such a @xmath0 at the tevatron or lhc would require the observation of a bump in the dijet mass spectrum , a difficult prospect due to large qcd backgrounds@xcite and finite jet energy resolution . in the absence of mixing with the sm @xmath19 , the @xmath0",
    "would also not be produced at future lepton colliders except via loops .",
    "as is easily demonstrated , the condition of leptophobia does not exist in",
    "_ conventional _ @xmath2 or @xmath1 models@xcite where the fermionic couplings are essentially determined by group theory , the choice of embedding and , in the @xmath1 case , by the value of a mixing angle @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , in the flipped ( non-@xmath2 unified ) @xmath22@xcite model , leptophobia is possible if one assumes that leptons do not carry @xmath23 quantum numbers ( , only the three * 10 * s carries a non - zero @xmath23 charge ) and one allows the @xmath23 charge assignments to be generation dependent in order to cancel anomalies .",
    "if we also demand that the @xmath0 couplings be at least approximately flavor diagonal in order to avoid problems associated with flavor changing neutral currents then there is no leptophobic @xmath0 case in this scheme as well .",
    "of course it is always possible to directly construct leptophobic @xmath0 models with generation independent couplings following a purely phenomenological approach@xcite but it is not clear how such models are embedded in a larger framework .    in a recent series of papers , babu , kolda and march - russell@xcite discussed the possibility of constructing a leptophobic @xmath0 model within @xmath1-type models through the dynamical effects associated gauge boson kinetic mixing(km)@xcite which occurs naturally at some level in almost all realistic gut or string models .",
    "km essentially arises due to the existence of incomplete gut representations at the low energy scale .",
    "for example , such a situation is seen to occur even in the mssm where the usual two higgs doublet superfields are low energy survivors associated with part of a pair of * 5*@xmath24 s at the high scale . while the higgs doublet components are light the remaining dangerous , color triplet isosinglet pieces are forced phenomenologically to remain heavy by proton decay constraints .",
    "even if km is naturally absent at the high scale , the partitioning of any of the multiplets will drive km to be non - zero at the tev scale via the renormalization group equations(rges ) .",
    "if there are enough low energy survivors from split multiplets with the correct quantum numbers , babu  showed that the effects of km on the @xmath0 couplings can be sufficiently large to obtain leptophobic conditions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to make a broad survey of models associated with new @xmath14 factors arising from @xmath1 and @xmath2 and to ascertain quantitatively the impact of km on the corresponding @xmath0 couplings .",
    "clearly if leptophobia is indeed possible a @xmath0 may be missed by present and future collider searches .",
    "we will show , subject to a reasonable set of assumptions , that the values of the parameters necessary for _ complete _ leptophobia , , identically zero vector and axial vector leptonic couplings , can not be achieved in these models .",
    "we also show that although km has dramatic consequences for the @xmath0 couplings in these scenarios it will still remain possible to discover the @xmath0 at both hadron and lepton colliders via their leptonic couplings .",
    "in addition we will show that it will still be possible to distinguish a @xmath0 originating from @xmath1 ( including km ) from , , a @xmath0 originating from the left - right symmetric model@xcite once the @xmath0 couplings are measured with reasonable accuracy at future hadron and lepton colliders .",
    "for the @xmath0 arising in @xmath2 we will show that ambiguities in identification remain unless the @xmath0 is directly produced at a lepton collider .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we set up our notation and review the essentials of kinetic mixing and @xmath0 couplings in general @xmath1 models which incorporate km .",
    "the possibilities associated with alternative fermion embedding schemes are discussed .",
    "we explicitly show how the search reaches for such a @xmath0 would be altered by an arbitrary amount of km at both the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we also show the km impact on the couplings themselves and the possible confusion that can arise when trying to determine the model from which the @xmath0 originated if km effects were allowed to be arbitrarily large .",
    "the basic formulae needed in our later analysis are also supplied here at the one - loop level . in section 3",
    "we discuss our model building assumptions and numerically analyze the resulting 68 @xmath1 models and 134 @xmath2 models to which these assumptions naturally lead .",
    "we demonstrate that exact leptophobia does not occur in any of these models even though the overall effects of km can be numerically substantial .",
    "the resulting allowed range of couplings are determined in all cases .",
    "the influence of kinetic mixing on the @xmath0 search reaches of the tevatron and lhc within these models is also examined in detail as are a number of issues relating to @xmath0 identification . a summary and discussion as well as our conclusions can be found in section 4 .",
    "consider the lagrangian for the electroweak part of the sm with the addition of a new @xmath14 field which is decomposed in the following manner : @xmath25 where the most general form of @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 representing the usual @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath16 fields , with the index ` a ' labelling the weak isospin .",
    "note that the term proportional to @xmath32 which directly couples the @xmath33 and @xmath29 fields is not forbidden by either @xmath31 or @xmath16 gauge invariance and corresponds to gauge kinetic mixing . in this basis",

    "the couplings are assumed to be ` gut ' normalized in this basis since we will assume that complete representations exist at the high scale . using the sm notation and normalization conventions , , @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40",

    "of course , for our purposes we must remember that all of the couplings in this term run with energy and are thus to be evaluated at the ew or tev scale to make contact with experiment .",
    "furthermore , recalling that @xmath44 is gut normalized , the @xmath0 piece of this interaction can also be re - written to conform to more conventional@xcite notation , , @xmath45 with as usual @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "it is clear that the conventional @xmath0 searches will fail in this region and that the dijet method would need to be employed to find the @xmath0 .",
    "arbitrarily large values of @xmath3 can also lead to possible confusion when @xmath0 couplings are extracted at , , future lepton colliders .",
    "it is well known that when km is absent sufficient data on @xmath0 couplings can be extracted at such machines , even below the @xmath0 production threshold , so that the @xmath0 s model of origin can be identified@xcite . when @xmath4 , the allowed ranges of the various vector and axial vector fermionic couplings in @xmath1 models is greatly extended in comparison to the more conventional case creating overlaps with the corresponding coupling values anticipated in other models .",
    "this result is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for both leptonic and @xmath61 quark couplings , these being the ones most easily measured . here the @xmath1 case with and without km is compared to the predictions of the left - right model@xcite , ma s alternative model@xcite , the un - unified model@xcite as well as to the reference case of a @xmath0 with sm couplings . in the km case",
    "it has been assumed for simplicity that @xmath55 and @xmath3 is confined to the range @xmath62 .",
    "one sees immediately that the presence of km leads to potential mis - identification of the @xmath0 even when precise measurements of the couplings are available .",
    "though not shown , similar effects would be observed in @xmath63-quark type couplings .",
    "clearly , if the range of @xmath3 is increased and/or @xmath56 were allowed to vary from unity by as small a value as say @xmath64 , the size of the @xmath1 coupling region would dramatically increase and the @xmath0 mis - identification potential would rise dramatically . note that the @xmath2 inspired @xmath9 model in the absence of km corresponds to the point of contact of the solid and dashed curves , , the non - km @xmath1 and lrm cases , in both the coupling planes . in this case",

    "we are now set to examine the values of @xmath3 and @xmath56 that can arise in a given model .",
    "in order to proceed we must consider how the low energy particle content of our models is to be chosen .",
    "these will follow from the following set of basic model building assumptions :    * the sm gauge couplings , together with that of the new @xmath16 , are assumed to perturbatively unify at a high scale as in the mssm .",
    "this has two immediate consequences : ( @xmath95 ) we can add only sets of particles that would form complete multiplets under @xmath96 , at least as far as their sm quantum numbers are concerned .",
    "( @xmath97 ) the number and types of new fields is restricted since perturbative unification is lost if too many multiplets@xcite are added .",
    "* all anomalies including those associated with the new @xmath16 must cancel amongst the low energy matter fields in the model . * additional matter multiplets beyond those contained in the mssm must be vector - like with respect to ( at least ) the sm .",
    "this not only helps with the anomaly problem but allows these new light fields not to make too large of a contribution to the oblique parameters@xcite forcing a conflict with precision electroweak data . when combined with the above requirements this tells us that at low energies we may add at most four @xmath98 s or one @xmath98 plus one @xmath99 , in addition to @xmath96 singlets , to the mssm spectrum .",
    "all higher dimensional representations are excluded .",
    "note that the addition of sm or @xmath96 singlets will leave @xmath3 invariant since neither @xmath100 or @xmath75 will be changed .",
    "however , @xmath101 is altered in this case leading to a shift in the value of @xmath56 . *",
    "the new matter fields are assumed to be low energy survivors from either @xmath102 s or from * 78 * s of @xmath1 since these are automatically anomaly free even under the full @xmath1 gauge group and may arise from strings .    given this set of conditions we can consider a number of specific cases beginning with @xmath1 itself .      here",
    "we know that the low energy theory contains three * 27 * s as well as a pair of ` higgs ' doublets , which we label as @xmath103 to avoid confusion with the members of the * 27 * , as in the mssm . complete * 27 * s are necessary so that the @xmath104 anomalies cancel for arbitrary values of @xmath21 .",
    "( the case @xmath105 corresponding to the @xmath0 from @xmath2 will be discussed separately in the next subsection . )",
    "these ` higgs ' are then the minimal split multiplet content at low energies .",

    "these ` higgs ' must arise from either a @xmath102 or * 78 * to avoid anomalies .",
    "since the three * 27 * s already contain three pairs of @xmath98 in addition to singlets in comparison to the mssm , we are free _ at most _ to only add a single ( ersatz ) @xmath98 to the low energy spectrum . since the @xmath103 fields also originate from a @xmath98 it is necessary to examine the @xmath108 quantum numbers of these additional fields since this is all that distinguishes amongst them .",
    "the @xmath102 contains three different choices : ( 1 )  @xmath109 , ( 2 )  @xmath110 and ( 3 )  @xmath111 , where the numbers in the parentheses are the @xmath112 quantum numbers as normalized in table 1 . the * 78 * on the otherhand contains only one candidate ( 4 )  @xmath113 ; this last case corresponds to the field content of the ` minimal ' model presented by babu  when @xmath5-type couplings are assumed@xcite . for each of these cases the corresponding contributions to @xmath75 and @xmath101",

    "the values of both @xmath101 and @xmath75 can also be directly calculated as above but depend visibly upon the choice , ( 1)-(4 ) , into which we embed the @xmath106 fields as well as the value of @xmath21 . with only 4 choices for the @xmath106 quantum numbers , the calculation is straightforward and we arrive at the results shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "( for numerical purposes we have taken @xmath121@xcite , @xmath122@xcite and @xmath123@xcite ; our results depend only weakly on these particular choices . ) from the figure several observations are immediate .",
    "first , both @xmath3 and @xmath56 are constrained to rather narrow ranges and leptophobia is not obtainable .",
    "second , the specific predicted values of @xmath3 and @xmath56 depend quite sensitively on the embedding choices ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "lastly , both @xmath3 and @xmath56 are also strongly @xmath21 dependent but the choice of @xmath5 couplings , , @xmath124 , extremizes their values .",
    "since @xmath125 and @xmath126 as we raise the survivor mass scale above @xmath127 , the curves actually represent the extreme boundaries of the parameter range obtainable for these quantities for case ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath5 couplings and @xmath106 embedding ( 4 ) we recover the value @xmath128 obtained@xcite by babu  in their so - called ` minimal ' model .    in case ( @xmath97 )",
    "the situation is somewhat more complex since the low energy spectrum now contains two ` higgs ' doublets , @xmath129 as well as a pair of isosinglet , color triplet superfields , @xmath130 .",
    "this uniquely fixes the values @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 but allows for @xmath134 possible(but not necessarily independent ) , @xmath21-dependent values for @xmath75 and @xmath101 .",
    "we can label our cases by the triplet ( i , j , k ) where the first(second , third ) index labels the embedding choice , , ( 1)-(4 ) , for the field @xmath106(@xmath135 ,  @xmath136 ) .",
    "for example , we may choose @xmath106 to be from ( 1 ) , @xmath135 from ( 3 ) and @xmath136 from ( 4 ) and we would label this subcase as ( 1,3,4 ) .",
    "all of the contributions can be directly obtained from the last two equations by choosing appropriate combinations .",
    "we have calculated both @xmath3 and @xmath56 for each of the 64 cases ; figure  [ fig4 ] shows the ` envelope ' of the range of values of @xmath3 and @xmath56 as functions of @xmath21 . in all cases",
    "the actual values must lie within the ` envelope ' .",
    "several observations are possible from these results .",
    "first , independently of the value of @xmath21 , we obtain the bounds @xmath137 and @xmath138 so that _ exact _ leptophobia is not achieved anywhere in the parameter space .",
    "( just how close we are to leptophobia will be discussed below . )",
    "the minimum[maximum ] value of @xmath139 $ ] is achieved for @xmath5-type couplings with the embedding ( 4,4,1)[(1,1,4 ) ] which corresponds to the so - called ` maximal ' model of babu .",

    "interestingly , the range of @xmath3 is sufficiently narrow so that none of the models listed in table 2 can achieve leptophobic conditions .",
    "next , we note that a further contribution to apparent leptophobia can occur in the @xmath5 coupling region since it is there that one obtains the smallest values of @xmath56 , rescaling the couplings to smaller values .",
    "( recall , the drell - yan rate for the @xmath0 scales as @xmath142 . )",
    "it would be nice to perform a two - loop rge calculation to verify these leading order results once these equations become available .    as models with @xmath5-type couplings are the only potential candidates for leptophobia , it is interesting to know the explicit @xmath143 correlation in this case .",
    "we display in figure  [ dis ] all of the 20 distinct solutions for @xmath3 and @xmath56 assuming this value of @xmath21 for models of either case ( @xmath95 ) or ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "to access just how leptophobic these models can be we calculated the @xmath0 search reach in each case for both the tevatron run ii and lhc following the procedure used to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at the tevatron , except for",
    "the most leptophobic case , the search reaches lie in the range @xmath144 gev for an integrated luminosity of 2(30 )  @xmath145 and generally conforms to the usual expectations . in the most leptophobic case , ( 4,4,1 ) , these values drop to only 524(778 ) gev , which is not great but far from nonexistent . at the lhc with a luminosity of 100  @xmath145",

    "this limit is poor relative to the others but it is quite substantial .",
    "thus although the ( 4,4,1 ) model is as close to leptophobia as possible , the @xmath0 s leptonic couplings remain large enough for this particle to be observed in drell - yan collisions but with a somewhat reduced reach .",
    "since the allowed ranges for both @xmath3 and @xmath56 are reasonably restricted for these 68 models we would expect that the possibility of confusing a @xmath1 @xmath0 with that of a different model would be at least somewhat reduced .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the regions of coupling parameter space allowed by the @xmath21-dependent @xmath3 and @xmath56 constraints obtained above .",
    "the regions are seen to be somewhat smaller than those shown in the more pessimistic fig.2 where @xmath56 was set to unity and @xmath3 was free to vary over the range @xmath62 .",
    "there is certainly a significantly smaller overlap between the @xmath1 model predictions and those of other @xmath0 models making in likely that these classes of models would be distinguishable given sufficiently precise data and combining the results obtained for different flavor fermions .      in some sense",
    "the @xmath2 case is easier to deal with than is @xmath1 since here the parameter @xmath105 is completely fixed . on the otherhand ,",
    "the number of split multiplets that we can add at low energies is much larger thereby increasing the number of subcases to be examined .",
    "the reason for this is that , unlike @xmath1 , the low energy content need only consist of the three * 16 * s of @xmath2 , plus the ` higgs ' fields @xmath106 for the anomaly cancelation constraint to be satisfied .",
    "this means that , as in the mssm , we may add ( @xmath95 ) up to four @xmath98 ersatz pairs or ( @xmath97 ) one @xmath99 either with or without an extra @xmath98 to this low energy content without a loss of perturbative unification .",
    "of course in none of these cases will leptophobia be achieved but we will be able to constrain the range of allowed values for both @xmath3 and @xmath56 . given this potentially large split multiplet field content at low energies it will be no surprise to find that these ranges are _ significantly _ larger than what was obtained above in the more constrained case associated with @xmath1 . for @xmath147 s and @xmath148 s , we already know from the mssm that @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",

    "these are completely specified by the values of @xmath3 and @xmath56 and are shown in figure  [ fig7 ] for all of the 134 subcases .",
    "notice that they span a large range but tend to cluster near , but not necessarily on top of , those of the lrm .",
    "we recall from our earlier discussion than in the absence of km the model @xmath9 couplings are exactly the same as those of the lrm with @xmath65 .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that once km is turned on there is no obvious relationship between the two sets of couplings , though they do seem to track one another .",
    "a short analysis , however , shows that there does exist a value of @xmath185 in the lrm for which the _ ratios _ of couplings are the same as in the @xmath9 model with km for any value of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that for this value of @xmath185 the couplings of the lrm and @xmath9 model with km are identical apart from an overall normalization .",
    "this is easily proved by considering both the general form of the lrm couplings and remembering that the value of @xmath186 can be written as a linear combination of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , where @xmath187 is the third component or the right - handed weak isospin .",
    "specifically we find that correspondence in the couplings between the two models occurs when @xmath189^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] and we see the conventional well - known result is recovered when @xmath125 . except for",
    "when @xmath3 is large and negative , @xmath190 , this equation has a solution in the physical region of the lrm , , @xmath191 .",
    "this result has very important implications to issues involving around @xmath0 coupling determinations at colliders .",
    "as is well known , most techniques aimed at identifying a new @xmath0 at hadron colliders@xcite actually employ observables which only determine various ratios of fermionic couplings .",
    "the extraction of coupling information from other observables , such as the @xmath0 total width , are not only subject to larger systematic errors but depend on assumptions about how the @xmath0 can decay .",
    "as we have just seen the ratios of @xmath2-inspired @xmath9 model couplings in the presence of km can be easily mimicked by those of the lrm with a suitably chosen value of the @xmath185 parameter .",
    "thus the @xmath0 s of these two models could be easily confused .    as an example of this , let us consider the production of a @xmath192 gev @xmath0 at the tevatron during run ii .",
    "after a few @xmath145 of luminosity are available several 100 s of events in the dilepton channel will have been collected . give the limited statistics , only a few of the variously proposed observables can be used to examine the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "in addition to the charged lepton forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath193 , one might measure the relative cross section in @xmath194 final states , @xmath195 , as suggested by@xcite , or the polarization of one of the @xmath196 s , @xmath197 , in @xmath198 , as suggested by@xcite .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the correlations amongst these observables and , in particular , compares the lrm predictions with those of the @xmath9 model with kinetic mixing .",
    "we see immediately that the two models would be quite easily confused .",
    "of course , in the lrm case a @xmath199 also exists with a mass somewhat less than the @xmath0 ; finding the @xmath199 may be the only way to distinguish these two cases .",
    "( in some cases , finding the @xmath199 may also be difficult@xcite . )    at lepton colliders operating below the @xmath0 production threshold , measurements made at a single @xmath200 are insensitive to the overall normalization of the @xmath0 couplings .",
    "their apparent values can be easily adjusted by a simple rescaling of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this weakness can be overcome at lepton colliders , however , by combining measurements taken at several distinct values of @xmath200@xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , lepton colliders can be used to distinguish the lrm and @xmath9 model with km cases .",
    "of course , if such a machine can operate on the @xmath0 pole and the coupling normalization determined , there will be no ambiguities in @xmath0 model identification .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed examination of the magnitude and influence of gauge kinetic mixing on couplings of the @xmath0 s which originate from either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "these mixing effects were shown to be completely described by the values of the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath56 which can be obtained via a renormalization group analysis . after introducing several model building assumptions we numerically analyzed the 68 @xmath1 and 134 @xmath2 models to which these assumptions naturally led .",
    "the values of both @xmath3 and @xmath56 were calculated for both sets of models , in particular , as functions of the mixing angle @xmath21 in the @xmath1 cases .    for the @xmath1 models ,",
    "since the number of additional low energy matter representations inducing kinetic mixing was constrained to be rather limited due to our model building assumptions , the allowed ranges of both parameters was shown to be quite restricted .",
    "futhermore , we demonstrated that exact leptophobia , which occurs when @xmath6 for the conventional @xmath1 particle embedding in model @xmath5 , is impossible to achieve in any of these models .",
    "this result was shown to be independent of how the fermions and additional vector - like matter fields necessary to induce kinetic mixing are embedded in gut representations . in the case which was closest to being leptophobic",
    ", we determined that the leptonic couplings of the @xmath0 were sufficiently large to render it visible in drell - yan collisions at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "of course in comparison to models where kinetic mixing is absent the reach for such a @xmath0 was found to be significantly reduced by @xmath201 .",
    "furthermore , in the general @xmath1 case , we showed that the couplings of the @xmath0 remain sufficiently distinct from those of other models , such as the left - right model , that they could be easily identified once sufficient statistics becomes available at future colliders .",
    "we demonstrated that this result would not hold if the magnitude of the kinetic mixing contributions to the @xmath0 couplings were left unrestricted .",
    "for the @xmath2-inspired @xmath9 models , the potential effects of kinetic mixing were shown to be more pronounced ( though leptophobia can never arise in these scenarios ) .",
    "this is due to the much larger range of split multiplets that may be introduced in this case while still satisfying our model building assumptions . in many cases",
    "kinetic mixing was shown to lead to values of @xmath56 significantly greater than unity which resulted in increased discovery reaches for these @xmath0 at both the tevatron and lhc .",
    "qualitatively , the significantly expanded range of allowed @xmath9 couplings were found to track those of the lrm . in particular",
    ", we demonstrated that for all allowed values of @xmath3 there exists a corresponding value of the lrm parameter @xmath185 for which the couplings in the two theories are identical apart from an overall normalization .",
    "this was shown to have a serious impact on @xmath0 model discrimination at hadron colliders as well as at lepton colliders unless data taken at multiple @xmath200 values is available foe analysis",
