    "one of the intriguing issues in condensed matter physics is the recent discovery of the new families of iron - based high - t@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "@xcite like cuprates , superconductivity arises from electron- or hole- doping of their antiferromagnetic(afm ) parent compounds .",
    "different from cuprates whose parent compounds are mott insulators , the parent compounds of the iron - pnictides are bad metals whose resistivity is several orders of magnitude larger than that of normal metals . when lowing the temperature , accompanied by the formation of spin - density - wave(sdw ) state ,  @xcite the parent compounds of @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) undergo a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition while for @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) the temperature for the structural transition is higher than that for the afm transition .",
    "neutron - diffraction measurements  @xcite show that the magnetic moment ( @xmath7 ) per fe at @xmath8 in @xmath9 is substantially larger than the moment ( @xmath10 ) per fe in @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite    experiments on @xmath0 compound  @xcite show an extra larger hole pocket around the @xmath12 point , different from other pnictides due to surface polarity or surface - driven electronic structure .",
    "it is believed that the sdw picture established in the @xmath1 compound could apply to the @xmath0 compound as well .",
    "the fermi surfaces(fss ) of the iron - pnictides have disconnected sheets , the strong nesting between the hole fss around the @xmath12 point and the electron ones around the @xmath13 point induces the sdw instability .",
    "the formation of sdw will partially gap the fss and will have great effect on the qpi as well as other physical properties . before unveiling the origin of superconductivity , understanding the ordered parent compound is an important task .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on pnictides has provided much useful information on the electronic properties .",
    "@xcite for underdoped @xmath1 compound @xmath14 , a remarkable nematic electronic structure  @xcite has been observed by means of spectroscopic - imaging ( si ) stm , where a one - dimensional ( 1d ) structure aligns along the crystal a - axis with antiparallel spins , and the qpi imaging disperses predominantly along the b - axis of the material . while for the parent compound of @xmath0 system @xmath15 , there are two types of surface after cleavage .",
    "stm studies have revealed that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) strong standing wave pattern  @xcite induced by the qpi appears in one type of surface .",
    "and the corresponding dispersions along @xmath16 and @xmath17 are similar .",
    "diversified electronic structure states have been observed in various systems ,  @xcite whether they play a key role in the mechanism of superconductivity  @xcite has triggered much attention and motivated our investigation .",
    "previously , based on some effective models , the qpi has been calculated by using different methods .",
    "@xcite in order to well explain the above mentioned experiments , we solve exactly the qpi patterns as well as their fourier component based on a phenomenological model  @xcite which considers the asymmetry of the as atoms above and below the fe - fe plane . due to the surface effect during cleavage ,",
    "the heights of the as atoms above and below the fe - fe plane may not be equal to each other , thus this model is suitable to study the properties of the surface layers in the iron - pnictides and should be more appropriate to describe the stm experiments which are surface - sensitive",
    ". our study will be within the framework of t - matrix method adopted by previous works .",
    "@xcite the most interesting result is that we can obtain 1d and 2d modulations of the ldos by employing the same model .",
    "the value of the magnetic order has great effect on the spatial modulation of the ldos .",
    "small value of magnetic order leads to 2d pattern while larger magnetic order results in 1d structure . in both cases , the patterns exhibit @xmath2 symmetry . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there still lack works concerning both of the interference patterns .",

    "the reason we adopt this model is that such a minimal model reproduces qualitatively the evolution of the fss observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite in both the electron- and hole- doped iron - pnictides .",
    "based on this model , the obtained phase diagram  @xcite , dynamic spin susceptibility  @xcite , andreev bound state inside the vortex core  @xcite as well as domain wall structure  @xcite are all consistent with the arpes  @xcite , neutron scattering  @xcite and stm  @xcite experiments . the tight - binding part of the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the site indices , @xmath22 are the orbital indices , and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",

    "our calculations show that at low energy @xmath199 , the spatial modulation of the ldos still has stripe pattern",
    ". however , at higher energy @xmath200 , beside the 1d high - intensity stripes there are two circles around the impurity .",
    "the dispersion pattern evolves with energy , at high energy @xmath200 the pattern changes dramatically and has 2d characteristics .",
    "therefore , the dispersion relation is complex in the multi - band system , and can not be fitted by a simple function as in the cuprates  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated by the t - matrix method the modulation of ldos and fc - ldos in the sdw state of the iron - pnictides induced by qpi for different impurity strength and well explained the two experimental works [ , ] .",
    "qpi is sensitive to the value of the magnetic order which may vary from one compound to another .    for small magnetic order , beside the high intensity small pockets aligning along the diagonal direction ,",
    "the zero - energy spectral function exhibits high - intensity squares around the @xmath12 point , therefore it is easy to form 2d qpi patterns .",
    "our calculations show that the 2d patterns of ldos exist in real- and q - space for various sps .",
    "the exact pattern varies with the energy and in some cases qpi induces ripple - like friedel oscillations .",
    "it is consistent with what have been observed in the @xmath0 compound .",
    "@xcite    for larger magnetic order , the main feature of the spatial modulation of the ldos is the 1d structure at the energies lower than sdw gap .",
    "the qpi pattern in momentum space also supports the formation of unidirectional nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "negative sp favors the inter - pocket scattering more than the repulsive one .",
    "the ldos on some sites in the vicinity of the impurity shows sharp in - gap resonance peaks since the corresponding ungaped fermi surfaces are enlarged and scattering have more probability to induce excitation at low energies .",
    "our calculations show that remarkable 1d stripe structure aligns along the fm direction in real space .",
    "the reason is that for large - m system , zero - energy spectral function has four isolated pockets along the afm direction . in addition , the topological analysis [ ] of a two - band model and a @xmath201-band model showed that the stable ungaped fermi pockets are along the afm direction thus we expect the qpi obtained in those models should have 1d stripe structure along the fm direction in real space , similar to our results .",
    "our model has @xmath153 symmetry around as iron , both the impurity and sdw could reduce the symmetry to @xmath2 .",
    "the ungaped fermi pockets as well as the underlying band structure have contribution to the qpi at bias energies away from zero .",
    "we obtain the 1d and 2d qpi patterns observed by experiments based on one phenomenological model , the microscopic origin of 1d and 2d qpi patterns is the shape of spectral function at low energies .",
