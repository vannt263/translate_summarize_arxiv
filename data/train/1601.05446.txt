    "discovery of gravitational states of ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) , i.e. quantum states in the gravitational field of the earth above a reflecting surface @xcite , opened an interesting field of fundamental studies of quantum systems bound by gravity @xcite .",
    "attractive properties of such states are their extremely small bounding energy on one hand and mesoscopic spatial size on the other hand .",
    "such properties enable searches for manifestations of nonstandard physics @xcite ( including axion - like interactions , non - newtonian short range gravity , etc ) .",
    "extension of this approach to the case of gravitational properties of antihydrogen ( @xmath0 ) is possible due to the phenomenon of quantum ( over - barrier ) reflection from attractive but steep antiatom - surface potential @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible for existence of long - living quasi - stationary states of @xmath0 in the gravitational field of the earth above material surface @xcite .",
    "study of gravitational quantum states of @xmath0 opens perspectives for using precise spectroscopic and interferometric methods for measuring the gravitational mass of @xmath0 @xcite and testing weak equivalence principle ( wep ) with antiatoms @xcite .",
    "gravitational states of ( anti)atoms could be much more sensitive to electric fields near material surface because of much larger polarizibility of atoms compared to neutrons . stray electric fields near material surface are known to be of significant importance for experiments with ultracold atoms .",
    "there are several known sources of stray fields .",
    "so called patch fields arise near polycrystalline metal surface because of different work fuctions of polycrystalline grains @xcite .",
    "they are affected by the surface contamination with adsorbed atoms or molecules producing dipole layers @xcite .",
    "the intensity of patch fields near gold surfaces was measured by monitoring electric stark shift in rydberg atoms @xcite or using kelvin probe force microscopy @xcite . in case of the ground state of ( anti)hydrogen atom ,",
    "the effect of such fields is weaker than the casimir - polder attraction .",
    "however , @xmath0 atoms bouncing on the surface could produce local charges on the surface due to annihilation in the bulk of the material mirror .",
    "an excess of energy released in the annihilation process is capable to ionize numerous surrounding atoms .",
    "this could be a possible source of accumulation of local charges on the surface .",
    "such residual charges on the surface could significantly modify mean interaction between an ( anti)atom and a material surface and quench gravitational states . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of quenching of gravitational states as well as transitions from low to highly excited gravitational states caused by the interaction with charges localized on the surface .",
    "in the following we will study the case of charges , localized on the surface within an area with a typical size @xmath1 small compared to the scattering length of @xmath0 atom on van der waals - casimir - polder potential @xmath2 nm @xcite .",
    "this in the region , where quantum reflection takes place ( at distances of the order of @xmath3 ) . the field produced by such charges can be treated as the field of a point - like charge @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction between an atom and a point - like charge at such distances is described by the polarization potential : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the dipole polarizibility of ( anti)hydrogen atom , @xmath7 is the atom - surface distance , @xmath8 is the charge - atom distance in the surface plane .",
    "the schrdinger equation , which describes @xmath0 motion in the gravitational field of the earth above a flat mirror with local charges on it , is :    @xmath9    here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath0 inertial and gravitational masses ( which we distinguish in view of their comparison in future experiments ) , @xmath12 is van der waals - casimir - polder potential , @xmath13 is the energy of @xmath0 .",
    "this equation is supplied with the full absorption boundary condition at the surface ( @xmath14 ) , which can be formulated as the condition of absence of a reflected wave from the surface @xcite : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the classical momentum of @xmath0 , and @xmath17 is the wave - function of planar motion .",
    "let us mention that such a boundary condition is valid due to the fact that wkb approximation holds with increasing accuracy when @xmath7 tends to zero .",
    "this boundary makes scattering insensitive to any details of interaction at the distances where wkb holds .",
    "the reflection amplitude is determined by those parts of potential , where wkb is broken ( so called badlands @xcite ) and where a reflected wave is generated @xcite . for pure van der waals - casimir - polder potential",
    "these are distances of the order of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is related to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath20 at large @xmath7 .",
    "the presence of @xmath21 not only modifies the properties of @xmath0-surface interaction in the region , which determines quantum reflection , but also couples normal and tangential motions of @xmath0 .    in the following",
    "we will be interested in the lifetime and population of gravitational states during @xmath0 motion along the mirror surface .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that characteristic scales of van der waals - casimir - polder interaction @xmath22 @xmath23 m are much smaller than the typical wave - length characteristic for gravitational interaction @xmath24{\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2mmg}}=5.871 $ ] @xmath23 m .",
    "we will restrict our treatment to such surface charges that the scattering length on the potential @xmath25 characteristic scale is much smaller than the gravitational wave - length @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 . in this case the shift and width of gravitational states due to the combined effect of short - range potentials @xmath12 and @xmath21 can be described via a complex scattering length @xmath28 @xcite , calculated for a fixed value of @xmath8 :    @xmath29 \\phi(z,\\vec{\\rho})=0,\\\\ \\frac{d}{dz } \\ln\\left(\\phi(z\\rightarrow 0,\\vec{\\rho})\\right)=-\\frac{1}{a(\\rho)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the complex scattering length @xmath28 can be evaluated from an asymptotic of the zero - energy solution @xmath30 of the schrdinger equation : @xmath31 with the boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) . here @xmath8 is treated as a parameter .",
    "the mentioned above asymptotic of such a solution has a form : @xmath32    thus the combined effect of van der waals - casimir - polder and polarization potential is accounted by means of a @xmath8-dependent boundary condition . in the following we will develop an approximation for solving above equations , based on the classical treatment of planar motion of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "in the following we will consider the planar motion ( parallel to the surface ) of @xmath0 as classical motion along a straight trajectory : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the initial planar position of the atom .",

    "can be transformed into another form , more convenient for perturbation treatment .",
    "the following complex coordinate and wave - function transformation : @xmath40 turns the equation system ( [ td1 ] ) into the following equation system with a time - independent boundary condition : @xmath41 \\psi(z',t),\\\\ \\psi(z'\\rightarrow 0,t)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    expanding the time - dependent wave function in the basis of gravitational states and using the known expression for matrix elements of momentum operator between gravitational wave - functions we come to the following set of coupled equations for the time dependent amplitudes of gravitational states @xmath42 : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the transition frequency between gravitational levels , @xmath45 are the solutions of eigen - value problem for gravitational states : @xmath46    here @xmath47 is the airy - function @xcite . in the following",
    "we will treat the case of a typical time of passage near the charge @xmath48 small compared to the typical gravitational time @xmath49 s. perturbative solution ( [ ceq ] ) for the transition amplitude with the initial condition @xmath50 in case of one surface charge is : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the time instant when the atom approaches to a surface charge at a minimum planar distance .    in the limit",
    "@xmath53 the above equation takes the form : @xmath54    in case of multiple charges , distributed on the surface and separated by large distances compared to @xmath55 , one gets : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the instant of the closest approach to @xmath58-th charge .    corresponding transition probability within the perturbation theory approximation is : @xmath59 the probability of transition to low excited gravitational states in the above approximation is the same for any such state : @xmath60 we performed formal transition to infinite limits of integration , as @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , such transformation is ensured by fast convergence of a corresponding integral for time large compared to the typical time - of - passage near scattering center .",
    "we will be interested in the probability of transition to all excited states , which can be obtained from ( [ probability ] ) by summing over all states .",
    "substituting summation by integration over transition frequency and using the fact that @xmath63 is an even function of @xmath64 we get the following expression for @xmath65 : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the number of scattering centers along trajectory ; we took into account that such centers are distributed stochastically ; factor @xmath68 appears when summation over gravitational states is substituted by integration over transition frequency @xmath69 .",
    "it is instructive to compare expressions ( [ ptot ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) .",
    "one can see from the above comparison , that fast perturbation with a characteristic duration time @xmath70 effectively populates @xmath71 gravitational states .",
    "let us mention that time dependence of the scattering length appears through time dependence of antiatom - scattering center planar distance ( [ rho ] ) . introducing a minimal distance @xmath72 between scattering center and strait line planar trajectory of antiatom",
    ", we get for the transition probability on one scattering center :    @xmath73    in the above expression we assume @xmath74 , keeping only first order terms in the transition probability .",
    "it is useful to introduce an effective transition radius ( an analog to the scattering cross - section in 3d case ) according to the following expression : @xmath75 with @xmath76 given by expression ( [ pd ] ) .    with this definition , expression ( [ ptot ] )",
    "can be reformulated as follows : @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the planar density of scattering centers , and @xmath79 is the characteristic length of a mirror . corresponding effective `` transition '' width is given by the following expression : @xmath80 taking into account ( [ pd ] ) we get for @xmath81 : @xmath82    the decay probability of ( each ) gravitational state within above approximations after passing one scattering center additional to constant decay rate on a plane surface is given by the following expression : @xmath83 taking into account smallness of this probability we get : @xmath84    introducing effective decay radius according to the following expression : @xmath85 we get the following expression for the decay probability during the flight along the mirror : @xmath86 effective decay width is given by the following expression : @xmath87 taking into account ( [ pdecs ] ) we get for @xmath88 : @xmath89    as one can see , the quenching mechanism of an initial gravitational state is due to the additional inelastic width , which antiatom gains while passing through the region with a modified atom - surface potential , as well as due to transitions to other gravitational states .",
    "however , two quenching mechanisms have different orders of magnitude .",
    "it follows from ( [ dtr ] ) and ( [ din ] ) that the ratio of corresponding quenching rates is given by : @xmath90 the above expression is less than unit in the range of @xmath4-values , where our approximations are valid .",
    "the dynamics of such quenching is determined by time dependent scattering length @xmath63 on the sum of van der waals - casimir - polder and polarization potentials . in the following sections we will calculate @xmath63 and evaluate the decay width and transition probabilities of the ground state .",
    "the complex scattering length is evaluated by numerically solving equation ( [ shreq0 ] ) with boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the scattering length @xmath91 , @xmath92 , as a function of the planar antiatom - scattering center distance @xmath8 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ rea10 ] , fig .",
    "[ ima10 ] , fig .",

    "@xmath93.,width=377 ]     as a function of the planar antiatom - charge distance .",
    "@xmath94.,width=377 ]     as a function of the planar antiatom - charge distance .",
    "@xmath94.,width=377 ]    it is worth mentioning rapid oscillations of @xmath91 and sharp maxima of @xmath95 .",
    "the physical reason for such oscillations in brief consists of the fact that a superposition of van der waals - casimir - polder potential @xmath12 and polarization potential @xmath96 produces two regions of over - barrier reflection .",
    "the separation between such regions depends on @xmath8 ( for given @xmath4 ) .",
    "such over - barrier reflection from two separated regions supports a near - threshold over - barrier resonance as soon as the distance between reflection regions matches a sort of standing wave condition .",
    "appearance of a near - threshold resonance is reflected in a fast change of the scattering length as a function of @xmath8 .    in order to demonstrate this statement we study the so called `` badland '' function : @xmath97 in the regions where @xmath98 wkb approximation fails and quantum reflection takes place . in fig .",
    "[ badland ] we show @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 a.u . and @xmath102 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath101 a.u .",
    "there is a region of wkb validity between two badland regions , which ensures `` standing wave '' resonance condition .",

    "[ dvplot ] . in particular ,",
    "@xmath105 m and @xmath106 m for @xmath107 @xmath108 and charge @xmath102",
    ". the effective scattering decay width ( [ gammad ] ) becomes comparable with the decay width on plane surface ( [ gammacp ] ) when the surface density of scattering centers @xmath109 @xmath110 equally charged with @xmath102 .",
    "such a critical density @xmath111 @xmath112 is an order of magnitude smaller for the charge of scattering centers @xmath113 .    , red line- @xmath104 , shown as a function of scattering center charge @xmath4 . ,",
    "we studied the quench mechanism for @xmath0 gravitational states above material surface caused by local electric charges , stochastically distributed along the mirror surface .",
    "we performed our analysis for the case of the characteristic time of charge - antiatom interaction smaller than the characteristic time typical for the gravitational interaction .",
    "this approximation enables us to obtain closed form results for the decay probability due to annihilation on the surface as well as due to transitions to excited states .",
    "such results are expressed in terms of the scattering length on the superposition of van der waals - casimir - polder and polarization potentials .",
    "let us note that the developed formalism is not specific for quenching by surface charges only , but also can be applied to quenching by any additional interaction , when the characteristic spatial radius is smaller than the gravitational wave - length , so that the scattering length approximation is justified .",
    "in particular , the obtained results could be applied to quenching by patch effects or surface roughness on the plane mirror .    the leading quenching mechanism in case of individual surface charges smaller than @xmath114 @xmath115 consists of enhanced annihilation of @xmath0 in the surface .",
    "this enhancement of annihilation originates from the decrease of quantum reflection on one hand and due to specific nearthreshold resonances , which appear in the superposition of van der waals - casimir - polder and polarization potentials on the other hand .    for individual charges on the surface equal to @xmath116 @xmath115 with a density of surface scattering centers equal to @xmath117 @xmath110 , the corresponding enhanced decay width would become comparable with the one on the plane surface without charges .",
    "this shows that the effect of local charges on lifetime of gravitational states can be neglected as long as the numbers for surface charges remain smaller than the values discussed above . as such densities of local charges",
    "can be experimentally controlled , false effects due to charges on the surface can be eliminated .",
    "one of the authors ( av ) is grateful to n. kolachevsky for postulating the problem and fruitful discussions ."
