    "conventional mesons are bound states made by a quark and an antiquark . yet , since the very beginning of qcd the search for other possibilities has attracted the attention of both experimentalists and theoreticians review .    as a prominent example , glueballs were predicted long ago : they are ( yet hypothetical ) bound states of solely gluons .",
    "computer simulations of qcd on the lattice have found a full spectrum of these states mainlattice , morningstar , but their firm experimental discovery has not yet taken place .",
    "on the other hand , a plenty of mesons , denoted as @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , has been unambiguously discovered in the last decade in the energy region of charm - anticharm and botton - antibotton states brambilla , braaten .  a clear explanation about the nature of these states is still lacking ( tetraquark and molecular hypotheses are a possibility ) .    the panda experiment at the fair facility @xcite in darmstadt / germany is designed to shed light on these questions .",
    "it is a proton - antiproton scattering experiment in which the energy of the antiproton can be finely tuned in such a way that a wide energy range in the charmonium region can be scanned .",
    "various resonances can be directly formed in proton - antiproton fusion processes .",
    "glueball , if existent , shall be found by this experiment . on the other hand , many of the @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 states can also be formed and/or produced with high statistics . in this lecture a theoretical view concerning the search of non - conventional mesons at panda will be presented .",
    "the lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) reads @xmath4where @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the generators and the structure constants of the group @xmath10 @xmath11 contains @xmath12 quark fields @xmath13 with corresponding bare masses @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath12 is the number of quark flavors ; in nature @xmath16 : u , d , s , c , b , t ) .",
    "each quark flavor has three colors ( red , green , blue ) . a crucial property of eq . ( [ lqcd ] )",
    "is that 3-gluon and 4-gluon vertices are present : gluons contrary to photons ` shine in their own light ' .",
    "we list the main symmetries and their meaning .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath11 is built under the requirement of invariance under _ local _ transformations of the @xmath17 groups .",
    "this means that one can rename at _ each space - time point _ the color of a quark via a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath20 ) and of the gluon field as : @xmath21one can , for instance , transform a blue quark in a red one in a certain space - time region without changing the properties of the system .",
    "\\(ii ) when the bare quark masses are equal ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is invariant under the interchange of quark flavors via a @xmath24 unitary matrix @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) as : @xmath27 .",
    "this is flavor symmetry , denoted also as @xmath28 : in simple terms , it means that gluons are ` democratic ' and couple to each quark flavor with the same strength .",
    "thus , one can rename also the quark flavor : it is allowed to interchange a @xmath29 quark with a @xmath30 quark , but this can be done only once for all space - time points ( the symmetry is global and not local ) . for @xmath31 , @xmath32 mev : the symmetry @xmath33 is well realized in nature ( this is isospin symmetry , responsible for instance for the almost equal mass of the three pions and of the proton and the neutron ) . for @xmath34",
    "the bare strange mass @xmath35 mev is sizably larger than @xmath36 and @xmath37 : nevertheless , the emergence of flavor multiplets with strange mesons is evident in the pdg , showing that an approximate @xmath38 is also realized @xcite .",
    "the limit in which all quark masses vanish ( @xmath39 is called the _ chiral limit _ and is important for the understanding of qcd because additional symmetries are present : dilatation invariance and chiral symmetry .",
    "\\(iii ) dilatation symmetry and its anomalous breaking . in the chiral limit",
    ", there is only one parameter in @xmath11 , the _ dimensionless _ coupling constant @xmath40 .",
    "the theory is classically dilatation invariant .",
    "however , upon quantization , a running coupling @xmath41 emerges .",
    "an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath42 is introduced in the process of regularization in such a way that @xmath40 is the coupling at this very high energy scale : @xmath43 .",
    "then , a low - energy scale @xmath44 emerges in the theory as@xmath45numerically , @xmath46 mev : all quantities in qcd depend crucially on it .",
    "\\(iv ) chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "one splits the quark field into the right - handed and left - handed components : @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath11 is _ separately _ invariant under rotations of right - handed quarks and left - handed quarks @xmath49where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two independent unitary matrices .",
    "such a chiral transformation is also denoted as @xmath52 .",
    "chiral transformation reduces to a flavor one for @xmath53 conversely , the case @xmath54 is called axial transformation @xmath55 ( which is not a group ! ) , which mixes states with different parity , as pseudoscalar and scalar mesons and vector with axial - vector ones .",
    "this symmetry is not realized in the hadronic spectrum @xcite because it is spontaneously broken by the nonperturbative qcd vacuum . as a consequence",
    "the quarks develop -even in the chiral limit- a large constituent ( or effective ) mass @xmath56 .",
    "quarks and gluons are the basic degrees of freedom of the @xmath57 lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lqcd ] ) .",
    "however , these are _ not _ the asymptotic states that we measure in our detectors .",
    "namely , quarks and gluons are _ confined _ into hadrons , where each hadron is _ white _ ( i.e. , invariant under the local color transformation introduced in  sec .",
    "we use the following _ definition _ : ` a meson is a strongly interacting particle ( a hadron ) with integer spin ' .",
    "this definition is consistent with the pdg @xcite , in which all mesons are listed together independently of their inner structure .",
    "a _ conventional meson _ is a meson constructed out of a quark and an antiquark .",
    "although it represents only one of ( actually infinitely many ) possibilities to build a meson , the vast majority of mesons of the pdg can be correctly interpreted as belonging to a quark - antiquark multiple pdg ( see also the results of the quark model @xcite )",
    ".    mesons can be classified by their spatial angular momentum @xmath58 the spin @xmath59 the total angular momentum @xmath60 and by parity @xmath61 and charge conjugation @xmath62 ( summarized in @xmath63 ) .",
    "the lightest mesons are pseudoscalar states with @xmath64 indeed , the pions and the kaons are pseudoscalar ( quasi-)goldstone bosons emerging upon the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . as an example , we write down the wave function for the state @xmath65 ( radial , angular , spin , flavor , color ) : @xmath66    for @xmath67 @xmath68 one constructs the vector mesons ( such as @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , for @xmath71 one has three multiplets : tensor mesons @xmath72 axial - vector mesons @xmath73 and scalar mesons @xmath74 ( scalar states are in the center of a long debate , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . by further increasing @xmath75 one",
    "can obtain many more multiplets @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the quantum numbers @xmath76 _ can not _ be obtained in a quark - antiquark system , but is possible for unconventional mesonic states ( such as glueballs ) .",
    "the experimental discovery of mesons with such _ _  exotic quantum numbers _ _ naturally points to a non - quarkonium inner structure .      according to lattice qcd",
    "many glueballs should exist mainlattice , morningstar , but up to now no glueball state has been unambiguously identified ( although for some of them some candidates exist ) .",
    "a suitable theoretical framework to study the decays of glueballs is the so - called extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) , which is an effective model of qcd built accordingly to the two fundamental symmetries mentioned in  sec .",
    "2 : chiral symmetry and dilatation invariance .",
    "the former is spontaneously broken by a mexican - hat potential , the latter explicitly broken in order to mimic the trace anomaly of qcd of eq .",
    "( [ ta ] ) , see ref . @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the elsm lagrangian contains only a finite number of terms .",
    "moreover , ( axial-)vector d.o.f . are included from the very beginning .",
    "the elsm was first developed for @xmath31 in refs .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath77 in  refs .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath78 in ref .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite a fit to many experimental data was performed and a good description of low - hadron phenomenology ( up to about @xmath79 gev ) was obtained . here",
    "we briefly recall the main results concerning glueballs .    _",
    "the scalar glueball _ is the lightest gluonic state predicted in  qcd and is naturally an element of the elsm as the excitation of the dilaton field  @xcite .",
    "the result of the recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the scalar glueball is predominantly contained in the resonance @xmath80 , in agreement with the lattice result of ref .",
    "the elsm makes predictions for the lightest ( and peculiar ) glueball state in a chiral framework , completing previous phenomenological works on the subject @xcite .    _",
    "the pseudoscalar glueball _ is related to the chiral anomaly and couples in a chirally invariant way to light mesons @xcite , where it was shown that it decays predominantly in @xmath81 ( @xmath82 of all decays into ( pseudo)scalar mesons ) and that it does _ not _ decay in @xmath83 : these are simple and testable theoretical predictions which can be helpful in the experimental search at the panda experiment , where the pseudoscalar glueball can be directly formed in proton - antiproton fusion process .",
    "a similar program can be carried out for a tensor glueball with a mass of about @xmath84 gev , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as for heavier glueballs , such as the ( pseudo)vector ones .",
    "the discovery in the last years of a plenty of enigmatic resonances -the so called @xmath0 states- shows that there are now many candidates of resonances beyond the standard quark - antiquark picture , see e.g. brambilla , braaten ( @xmath85 was the first to be experimentally found by belle in 2003).the interpretation of these states is subject to ongoing debates : tetraquarks and molecular interpretations are at the top of the list , but it is difficult to distinguish among them @xcite .",
    "moreover , distortions due to quantum fluctuations of nearby threshold(s ) take place and make the understanding of these resonances more complicated @xcite . remarkably , the @xmath3 states are _ charged _ states in the charmonium region : a system made of four quarks is here necessary to understand them since a charmonium is necessarily chargeless ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are also other mesonic states which are not yet understood .",
    "an example is the strange - charmed scalar state @xmath86 , which is too light to be a @xmath87 state and could be a four - quark or a dynamically generated state .",
    "historically , the scalar mesons below 1 gev were among the first to be interpreted as non - quarkonium objects , but as a nonet of tetraquarks tetraquark or as dynamically generated states @xcite .",
    "in the future panda experiment at the fair facility in darmstadt @xcite , antiprotons reach a three - momentum @xmath88 in the range @xmath89-@xmath90 gev and hit protons at rest .",
    "we consider here the case in which the proton and the antiproton completely annihilate and generate a particle @xmath91 ( as for instance a glueball ) with mass @xmath92 .",
    "the four - momentum of the antiproton reads @xmath93 while that of the proton is @xmath94 by denoting @xmath95 as the four - momentum of @xmath1 we obtain out of @xmath96 that : @xmath97by looking at the lattice spectrum of ref .",
    "@xcite , we realize that -besides the scalar glueball which is too light- all non - exotic glueball states could be directly formed at the panda experiment .",
    "this represents a clean environment to study experimentally their decays .",
    "glueballs with exotic quantum numbers ( called oddballs ) can not be directly formed because a proton - antiproton system undergoes the same limitations of a quark - antiquark system for what concerns @xmath63 quantum numbers .",
    "nevertheless , oddballs will also be produced together with other resonances and will be studied as well . besides the search for glueballs , all mesonic states discussed above will be experimentally investigated .",
    "in this work we have given a brief overview of some aspects of the theoretical as well as experimental search for unconventional mesons .",
    "the panda experiment will play a decisive role in the future of hadron physics , since it will help to clarify many open questions of hadron spectroscopy in general and of exotic mesons in particular .",
    "the search for and hopefully the firm discovery of glueballs ( and hybrids ) , as well as the confirmation and measurement with high statistics of the @xmath0 states will be important milestones toward a better understanding of qcd .",
    "the author thanks all the members of the group for chiral field theories of frankfurt for many valuable cooperations and discussions .",
