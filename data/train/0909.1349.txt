    "* ) , the role of the most rarefied environment ( typical of voids ) on galaxy formation and evolution is less studied both theoretically and observationally . for observational aspects , various selection effects",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , most galaxies with known radial velocities come from spectral surveys of magnitude - limited samples .",
    "wide - field spectral surveys have typical magnitude limits corresponding roughly to @xmath1118 .",
    "this apparent magnitude limit implies that for distances well beyond the local supercluster ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath6 ) , where large voids were found , the faintest selected galaxies will have the absolute magnitudes m@xmath13 of @xmath316 or higher .",
    "this implies that the study of distant voids is limited by the galaxies with m@xmath13 of only @xmath323 mag .",
    "fainter than that corresponding to the luminosity of l@xmath14 ( m@xmath1519.5 ) .",
    "the latter ( or close to this ) is usually used for selection of galaxies delineating the borders of ` empty ' regions - voids . therefore , even the most advanced studies of void galaxy population , based on very large samples with redshifts from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath160.030.05 , were limited by the galaxy samples with luminosities only 1.5 - 2  magnitudes fainter than m@xmath1719.5 . since the possible difference of galaxy properties in various types of environment",
    "is expected to depend on galaxy mass , these ` shallow ' probes of ` distant ' void galaxy population , based on the sdss samples , may be inadequate to get deeper insights into the questions .    in order to probe the properties of smaller luminosities void galaxies , a wide - angle redshift survey with a similar magnitude limit",
    "is needed , for a volume located several times closer than those used in the previous studies .",
    "apart from the giant local void described by @xcite , which extends to tens mpc and appears almost empty , several relatively small voids adjacent to the local volume ( defined by d @xmath18 10  mpc , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are identified ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one more such void in lynx - cancer sky region was noticed by @xcite . due to its relative proximity ( d@xmath19 @xmath314  mpc ) ,",

    "the dwarf galaxies population in nearby voids , and in particular , in this lynx - cancer void , will permit to advance significantly in probing void dwarf galaxy properties .",
    "this will also give a base for a comparison of the _ evolutionary status _ of void dwarf galaxies and those located in the regions with the higher galaxy density .",
    "coming back to the study of void galaxy population , it is worth noting the well known correlation between galaxy luminosities and their central surface brightnesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since most of voids galaxies are dwarfs ( as seen , in particular , in the sample of galaxies falling on lynx - cancer void ) , with the major fraction by number of low luminosities , the proportion of lsb galaxies in voids is expected to be also higher . in the sdss project , relatively high surface brightness ( sb )",
    "lower limits have been used for spectroscopic target selection .",
    "therefore , the completeness for the sdss redshift samples falls below 50% for objects with the half - light @xmath20 23.5  mag  arcsec@xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the resulting sdss galaxy samples with redshifts are biased against lsb galaxies and this can lead to a substantial loss of lsb dwarf galaxies in void galaxy samples . some of these missing galaxies might form the youngest local galaxy population @xcite .",
    "blind hi surveys can overcome this selection effect , at least for late - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the arecibo blind hi survey alfalfa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will further increase the current lynx - cancer void dwarf sample and will find mainly lsbd new galaxies .",
    "the currently available dwarf sample includes about fifty late - type galaxies ( pustilnik et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    during the systematic study of dwarf galaxies in the lynx - cancer void we have already discovered several unusual objects , including ddo  68 @xcite , hs  0822 + 3542 , sao  0822 + 3545 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the case study of one of the lynx - cancer void genuine lsb dwarfs , which passed through the sdss spectral target sb selection criterion because of its almost edge - on viewing direction and its brightening in apparent sb .",

    "for our current study the images in the respective filters were retrieved from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the situation is similar for spectra obtained during the other nights .",
    "the main goal of our spectral observations was to get the most reliable estimate of the galaxy parameter o / h from the data on the regions * a * and * b*. due to the low quality of individual measurements , it is necessary to average all of them together .",
    "however , the seeing during two of four nights was somewhat poor ( 19 - 23 ) to resolve these regions as individual in our 2d spectra . to use all spectral data in the most efficient way , we employ the following approach .    first",
    ", we have checked how robust is the estimate of o / h for two adjacent regions with the same o / h , but somewhat different physical conditions and emission line relative intensities , if we measure them first separately and second , as one entity .",
    "we have simulated the artificial ` sum ' spectrum of this one entity , just summing up fluxes of all lines in the two individual spectra .",
    "the latter were chosen to have the line intensity ratios similar to the observed ones . as one could expect from the general principle of analytic functions",
    ", the resulting physical parameters appeared half - way between those for individual objects , and the o / h , in turn , to be very close ( within 0.01  dex ) to the single value of the two individual objects . since the sum spectra of regions * a * and * b * also have better s - to - n ratio than the spectra of individual components , assuming that their o / h are the same , we decided to extract in all four independent 2d spectra the same region of 21 rows ( or 7.5 ) along the slit , which includes both regions and gives us 1d spectra with the sum of fluxes of both regions .",
    "in table  [ tab : intens1 ] , we present the line intensities f(@xmath27 ) of all relevant emission lines measured in all four obtained ` composite ' spectra , integrated over the region with extent of 21 pixel along the slit , which includes both regions * a * and * b * , normalised by the intensity of h@xmath31 , and i(@xmath27 ) , corrected for the foreground extinction c(h@xmath31 ) and the equivalent widths of underlying balmer absorption lines ew(abs ) .    in table",

    "the s - to - n ratio in the principal faint line [ ] @xmath274363 is quite low in all analysed spectra ; this leads to large errors in t@xmath32  and , respectively , to large errors in the derived o / h values . in such cases , or when",
    "[ ] @xmath274363 is not detected , in the low - metallicity regime , @xcite proposed the so - called semi - empirical method which employs the relation between the total relative intensity of lines [ ] @xmath334959,5007 and [ ] @xmath273727 and t@xmath32 .",
    "this method was tested on several of the most metal - poor -regions in @xcite and also by us on our own data .",

    "the resulting values of o / h for each of the nights are shown in the bottom of table  [ tab : composit ] .",

    "the @xmath63 colours of the ` ridge ' are better consistent with instantaneous starburst occurred several hundred myr ago .",
    "the @xmath63 colours of the ` outer ' region appear a bit offset from the continuous sf track , but accounting for the observed colour errors , the difference is not significant .",
    "the nearest part of the track ( in terms of amount of @xmath64 and the related probability ) corresponds to the ages of stellar population of @xmath313  gyr .",
    "that is , within the limits of measurable lsb periphery , the oldest visible stellar population appears quite young ( @xmath32  gyr ) , in difference with the absolute majority of thousands galaxies , for which the similar data are acquired . in the @xmath65 colour plot ( not shown )",
    "both tracks go too close each to other , so the galaxy @xmath65 colours alone would be inconclusive .",

    "in table  [ tab : param ] we present the main parameters of the studied galaxy . from the total magnitudes in filters @xmath26 and @xmath40 ( table [ tab : photo ] ) , with the transformation equations of @xcite",
    ", we derive the total @xmath66-band magnitude , @xmath67=17.34@xmath10.03 . for the accepted distance modulus of sdss j0926 + 3343 @xmath68=30.16 ( d=10.7 mpc and a@xmath13=0.08 ) its absolute magnitude m@xmath6912.90 .",
    "the latter corresponds to l@xmath13=2.24@xmath2210@xmath39  l@xmath13@xmath9 .",
    "then , from the m(hi ) derived in the previous section , one obtains the ratio m(hi)/l@xmath23.0 ( in solar units ) .",
    "this value is rather large for the local universe galaxies and is among the few per cent highest ratios ever measured .    from the hi line width at 20%-level of the maximum intensity , w@xmath36",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we accept that the hi radius of this galaxy is 2.7  r@xmath45 , that is @xmath745.2  kpc .",
    "then , from the relation m(@xmath75 ) = v@xmath76  @xmath77/@xmath78 , where @xmath78 is the gravitational constant , one derives the total mass within @xmath77 as follows : m@xmath79=12.4@xmath2210@xmath7  m@xmath9 . to get the estimate of the galaxy gas mass",
    ", we sum m(hi ) and m(he ) ( a fraction of 0.33 of hi mass ) that gives m@xmath80=9.04@xmath2210@xmath39  m@xmath9 .",
    "the mass of stars can be estimated as follows .",
    "we take from table  [ tab : photo ] the total @xmath26-magnitude of the lsb disc ( without light of regions ) , equal to 17.14",
    ". we also account for the light contribution of the younger stellar population of the ` ridge ' , of the order of 10  % in @xmath26-filter .",
    "then , the improved estimate of the lsb disc @xmath26-filter magnitude is 17.24 .",
    "this corresponds to the extinction - corrected absolute magnitude m@xmath81=13.0 .",

    "this lsbd galaxy is clearly a dark - matter dominated one . to get a better precision estimate of the dm halo mass and its radial distribution",
    ", one needs hi mapping of the galaxy .    having all these unusual properties in one object ( the record - low value of o / h , ` young ' ( t@xmath32@xmath11  gyr ) main stellar population , large gas - mass fraction )",
    ", the galaxy sdss j0926 + 3343 represents a nice nearby laboratory to study several cosmologically related issues .",
    "this looks to be very isolated dwarf galaxy ( the nearest luminous galaxies are at d @xmath89 2 mpc ) and , thus , provides a good opportunity to study the sf , induced presumably by the internal instabilities in the most metal - poor environment and at quite low disc baryonic surface densities .",
    "the star ` clusters ' or ` stellar associations ' responsible for ionisation of regions * a * and * b * , according to the values of their ew(h@xmath31 ) are quite young , having ages of 78 myr .",
    "therefore , one can hope to find in them individual massive stars with z @xmath3z@xmath9/35 , similar to , e.g. , the lbv star in that low - z dwarf galaxy ddo  68 @xcite .",
    "studying gas kinematics in this lsbd may determine the density distribution of the dm halo , and thus , better constrain the dm nature .",
    "there is still a chance that this lsbd galaxy experiences a substantial external disturbance , since its disc looks somewhat warped , and its main sf sites are situated at large distances from the galaxy centre .",
    "however , the alternative option of triaxial dm halo can also explain the visible warps in this lsbd disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , hi maps with the angular resolution of 5  - 10would help to elucidate the neutral gas morphology and kinematics and to check the hypothesis of an intergalactic hi cloud infall or a minor merger .",
    "looking at this unusual galaxy in a more general aspect , one can notice its appearance in the nearby lynx - cancer void , where other very metal - poor and unevolved dwarf galaxies are found .",
    "they include , in particular , ddo  68 at the mutual distance to sdss j0926 + 3343 of only @xmath31.6  mpc @xcite , and hs  0822 + 3542 and sao  0822 + 3542 @xcite .",
    "a few xmd dwarf galaxies in the region of this void found by @xcite , as well as several more such galaxies found by us , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    in table",
    "[ tab : param ] , along with the data for sdss j0926 + 3343 , we present the properties of ddo  68 , in order to emphasise the range of parameters in two ` neighbouring ' most metal - poor dwarf galaxies residing in the lynx - cancer void . the blue luminosity and the gas mass of ddo  68 are higher by an order of magnitude , while its optical size is larger by a factor of @xmath35 . the ddo  68 morphology , kinematics and stellar colours imply that its appearance is related to the recent merger ( @xmath31 gyr ago ) of two very gas - rich and very metal - poor dwarf galaxies ( or gas clouds / protogalaxies ) .",
    "the increased density of such rare objects in this region is certainly not by chance .",
    "xmd galaxies seem to prefer residence in some selected regions .",

    "the existence of the sizable hi cloud population in ` nearby ' voids , with the baryonic masses comparable to those of dwarf galaxies , visible through their ly-@xmath90 absorption , also hints on the unevolved state of the significant fraction of baryons in voids .",

    "the hi integrated flux and the velocity width data for this galaxy , along with the optical photometry and the size estimates , indicate the very gas - rich object , with m(hi)/l@xmath23.0 and with the derived gas mass - fraction of @xmath1090.6 .",
