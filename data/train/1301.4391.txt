    ", @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the scaled planck constant , @xmath17 is an @xmath18 time - dependent potential and @xmath19 is the wave function .",
    "the wave function @xmath19 is used to define primary physical quantities , called _ observables _ ( @xcite ) , such as the _ position density _ , @xmath20 and the _ current density _ , @xmath21 problems related to are of great interest in physics and engineering . however , the solution of is complicated from the theoretical as well as the numerical analysis point of view .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath15 small ( close to zero ) , the solution of oscillates with wavelength @xmath22 , preventing @xmath19 to converge strongly as @xmath23 .",
    "because of this , standard numerical methods fail to correctly approximate @xmath19 and the observables , unless very fine mesh sizes and time steps are used .",
    "in particular , previous works ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) suggested that for standard finite element ( fe ) methods there is a very restrictive dispersive relation connecting the mesh sizes ( space and time ) with parameter @xmath15 ; cf . ,",
    "e.g. , below .",
    "this restrictive dispersive relation can be relaxed using the so - called time - splitting spectral methods , introduced earlier by bao , jin & markowich in @xcite , for the approximation of the solution of . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to show that constructing adaptive algorithms based on rigorous a posteriori error control leads to cnfe schemes which are competitive to the best available methods for the approximation of the solution ( and the observables ) of the semiclassical schrdinger equation , and in general of linear schrdinger equations of the form .",

    "optimal order a posteriori error estimates for the heat equation for cnfe schemes with fe spaces that are allowed to change in time have been derived very recently by bnsch , karakatsani & makridakis in @xcite .",
    "however the extension of those ideas from the simple heat equation to the linear schrdinger equation is of increased difficulty due to the complex - value and multiscale nature of the problem . because of this",
    ", novel ideas and techniques are introduced .",
    "more precisely , our main contributions are :    1 .",
    "derivation of optimal order a posteriori error bounds in the @xmath0norm for cnfe schemes for .",
    "the fact that the analysis includes time - dependent potentials , makes the problem more challenging since there are no rigorous results for schrdinger equations for such potentials .",
    "in addition the existing literature on a posteriori error analysis for problems with time - dependent operators of the form @xmath24 is quite limited . to the best of our knowledge , only in @xcite",
    "the authors consider similar operators .",
    "moreover the derived estimates hold for @xmath25type potentials as well , in contrast to the existing literature .",
    "in particular , existing results require smooth @xmath26type potentials .",
    "however , this regularity requirement on the potential is rather restrictive from applications point of view . including @xmath18 time - dependent potentials in the analysis",
    "is important for another reason : it can be considered as the first step for the a posteriori error control of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations .",
    "more precisely , the relaxation scheme introduced by besse in @xcite suggests that a posteriori error bounds for linear schrdinger equations with @xmath25type time - dependent potentials is essential for the efficient approximation of the solution of certain nls equations .",
    "introduction of a _ novel elliptic reconstruction _ leading to upper bounds that do not involve the global @xmath25norm of @xmath27 , and thus , to bounds that do reflect the physical properties of the problem.the elliptic reconstruction was developed by makridakis & nochetto in @xcite to derive optimal order @xmath28 a posteriori error bounds for fe spatial discrete schemes for the heat equation using energy techniques .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this notion of the elliptic reconstruction to schrdinger equations leads to estimates that involve the @xmath25norm of the potential .",
    "consequently , the obtained estimates are practically useless and adaptivity is inefficient , even in the simplest case of constant potentials .",
    "therefore , proposing a modified elliptic reconstruction based on the physical properties of the problem under consideration is crucial for the efficient error control of ( and so ) . additionally , the new ideas developed for this purpose might be useful for other problems as well , such as convection - diffusion or reaction - diffusion problems",
    "a detailed numerical study on the reliability and robustness of the a posteriori estimators through a _ time - space adaptive algorithm_. our starting point is the adaptive algorithm proposed in @xcite , adapted to the linear schrdinger equation , .",
    "the a posteriori estimators derived in this work are on the solution @xmath19 of .",
    "however , in many applications observables like the position density , or the current density are far more important than the solution itself .",
    "thus , we introduce an appropriate modification of the a posteriori estimators and the adaptive algorithm .",
    "this modification is based on a heuristic idea and the results concerning the observables are very encouraging .",
    "overall , the adaptive algorithm reduces the computational cost substantially and provides efficient error control of @xmath19 and the observables for small values of the planck constant @xmath15 .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain such results via standard techniques and without adaptivity .",
    "we point out that our purpose is not to prove convergence and optimality of the considered time - space adaptive algorithm , but rather to show that adaptivity based on rigorous a posteriori error control can be proven beneficial for the approximation of the solution ( and the observables ) of the linear semiclassical schrdinger equation .",
    "in addition , it is to be emphasized that as long as the adaptive algorithm converges , we can guarantee rigorously , based on the a posteriori error analysis , that _ total error remains below a given tolerance_.    for parabolic problems , a number of adaptive algorithms exists in the literature ; cf . , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . however , convergence and optimality of time - space adaptive algorithms are very delicate and difficult issues . in the literature",
    "exists only one proven convergent time - space adaptive algorithm for evolution problems and can be found in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is appropriate for the heat equation and backward euler fe schemes and it is not clear how to generalize it to other problems and higher order in time methods .    despite the fact that problem ( and thus ) is linear , a posteriori error bounds and adaptive algorithms for linear schrdinger equations are very limited in the literature . in particular ,",
    "a posteriori error estimates in the @xmath0norm for fully discrete cnfe schemes have been proven earlier by drfler in @xcite ; these estimates are first order accurate in time , thus not optimal . using these estimates",
    ", drfler also proposes an adaptive algorithm in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we considered only time - discrete approximations and we managed to prove optimal order a posteriori error estimates for in the @xmath28 and @xmath29norms .",
    "this was achieved using the crank - nicolson reconstruction proposed by akrivis , makridakis & nochetto in @xcite .",
    "similar estimates for , using an alternative reconstruction , proposed by lozinski , picasso & prachittham in @xcite , can be found in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "optimal order a posteriori error estimates for fully discrete cnfe schemes do not exist in the literature .",
    "some preliminary results to that direction can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , the a posteriori estimators derived in @xcite are scaled by the global @xmath25norm of @xmath27 . hence , as already mentioned , the derived estimators do not reflect the physical properties of the problem , which makes adaptivity through these estimates not reliable .",
    "a posteriori error estimates in the @xmath0norm have been proven earlier in @xcite for uniform partitions and the time - splitting spectral methods for the linear schrdinger equation in the semiclassical regime . in @xcite ,",
    "only the one - dimensional case in space is studied and the analysis , as in @xcite , permits only time - independent potentials , without being obvious how the theory can be extended to time - dependent potentials .",
    "in addition , the time - spectral methods require smooth potentials ; the particular analysis is not applicable for @xmath25type potentials .",
    "the analysis of the current paper is based on the introduction of appropriate space - time reconstructions .",
    "such reconstructions for cnfe methods and fe spaces that are allowed to change in time were introduced , for the first time , very recently , by bnsch , karakatsani & makridakis in @xcite , for the proof of optimal order a posteriori estimates in the @xmath0norm for the heat equation . to define those time - space reconstructions ,",

    "the two last sections are devoted to the numerical investigation of the efficiency of the estimators .",
    "in particular , in section  [ unif ] , we validate numerically the optimal order of convergence of the estimators using uniform partitions . for the linear schrdinger equation in the semiclassical regime , we verify numerically that the estimators have the expected behavior with respect to the scaled parameter @xmath15 . finally , in section  [ adapt ] , we appropriately modify and apply to the one - dimensional semiclassical schrdinger equation a time - space adaptive algorithm described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we further develop the algorithm and we make it applicable for the approximation not only of the exact solution @xmath19 but also for the observables , and we discuss in detail the benefits of adaptivity for equations of the form .",

    "<S> we derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates for fully discrete approximations of linear schrdinger - type equations , in the @xmath0norm . for the discretization in time we use the crank - nicolson method , while for the space </S>",
    "<S> discretization we use finite element spaces that are allowed to change in time . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the estimators is based on a novel elliptic reconstruction that leads to estimates which reflect the physical properties of schrdinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> the final estimates are obtained using energy techniques and residual - type estimators . </S>",
    "<S> various numerical experiments for the one - dimensional linear schrdinger equation in the semiclassical regime , verify and complement our theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical implementations are performed with both uniform partitions and adaptivity in time and space . for adaptivity </S>",
    "<S> , we further develop and analyze an existing time - space adaptive algorithm to the cases of schrdinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> the adaptive algorithm reduces the computational cost substantially and provides efficient error control for the solution and the observables of the problem , especially for small values of the planck constant . </S>"
