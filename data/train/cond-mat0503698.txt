    "the potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal exhibits a discontinuous phase transition at @xmath1 from a tetragonal paraelectric phase to an orthorhombic ferroelectric phase .",
    "the specific heat anomaly at transition temperature shows@xcite a strong @xmath2-type anomaly ; perhaps , that is why the transition was initially considered continuous .",
    "however reese@xcite showed that the transition is discontinuous by measuring its latent heat , which was evaluated to be @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that discontinuity disappear under the influence of pressure or electric field .",
    "the value of the critical electric field @xmath4 for which the discontinuity disappears is a subject of discussion .",
    "reese et al.@xcite also carried out a measurement of the specific heat with an applied field of @xmath5 finding a controversial evidence of latent heat .",
    "above @xmath6 they found no evidence of latent heat and suggested @xmath7 from the shift of the maximum of the specific heat as function of the electric field .",
    "measurements of specific heat under electric field higher than @xmath8 was carried out by sandvold and fossheim@xcite and the authors suggest that landau theory for continuous transitions with @xmath9 potential was appropriate to describe the shape of specific heat curves .",
    "other works have lead to estimations of the critical field .",
    "for instance , strukov et al.@xcite evaluated @xmath10 from electrocaloric experiments .",
    "sidnenko and gladki@xcite found @xmath11 while okada and sugie@xcite obtained @xmath12 for @xmath4 .",
    "vallade@xcite deduced a value of @xmath13 from birefringence measurements .",
    "in contrast to these values , kobayashi et al.@xcite found , by x - ray measurements , @xmath14 ; eberhard and horn@xcite derived a value of @xmath15 from dielectric susceptibility .    in this frame",
    "it would be interesting to evaluate the latent heat as a function of the electric field to determine the value of the critical electric field @xmath4 for which latent heat becomes null .",
    "the difficulty of an accurate determination of @xmath4 from calorimetric measurements in standard equipments such as _ differential thermal analysis dta _ and _ differential scanning calorimeter dsc_is that these systems really measure changes of enthalpy which has two contributions near the transition : one due to the latent heat and other due to the variation of specific heat with temperature . in the case of phase transitions near a tricritical point or a discontinuous ferroelectric phase transition under an electric field close to the critical field",
    ", the specific heat presents a strong anomaly and latent heat becomes very small .",
    "this fact makes difficult to separate both contributions and to distinguish the temperature interval where the latent heat is present .",
    "this may explain the lack of study of the influence of electric field , smaller than @xmath4 , on specific heat and latent heat of kdp after reese@xcite .    our group has developed a method , named _",
    "square modulated differential thermal analysis _ _ _",
    "smdta__@xcite , based on conduction calorimetry , which is able to measure absolute values of specific heat and the heat flux exchanged by the sample when its temperature is changed at a rate as low as @xmath16 .",
    "the comparison of the data allows us to separate the above two contributions to the total enthalpy and to evaluate the latent heat , in case there were any .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied to the study of the almost tricritical phase transition of @xmath17@xcite , whose latent heat was firstly measured with this technique .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the substitution of @xmath18 by @xmath19 was also investigated measuring the latent heat@xcite , which showed that the doping makes the transition become continuous@xcite .",
    "the method of smdta has been also applied to show that the phase transition in @xmath20@xcite , whose character was also controversial , is continuous .    in this paper",
    "we have applied this method to study a single crystal .",
    "we have measured the specific heat and the heat flux exchanged by the sample in the neighborhood of the ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "the measurements have been carried out at four values of @xmath21 : , , , .    simultaneously to these measurements , the dielectric susceptibility of the sample has also been measured and we have related its behaviour around transition temperature with the temperature interval where the latent heat is produced .",
    "dielectric measurements provide information about the mechanism of ferroelectric phase transition of kdp crystal@xcite and the simultaneous measurement of thermal and dielectric properties would be worthy .",
    "the measurements were performed in a high resolution conduction calorimeter which has been described previously in details@xcite .",
    "the sensor is formed by two identical heat fluxmeters , each one having 48 chromel - constantan thermocouples connected electrically in series but thermally in parallel .",
    "the sample is pressed between both fluxmeters whose signal is measured by a keithley 182 nanovoltmeter .",
    "two electrodes and two heaters are placed between sample and fluxmeters .",
    "the sensor is placed inside a calorimeter block which is suspended within two cylindrical radiation shields .",
    "the whole assembly is then placed in a hermetic outer case at a high vacuum .",
    "the device is then surrounded by a coiled tube and placed in an alcohol bath .",
    "liquid @xmath22 circulates through the coil and regulates the temperature of the bath with a good thermal stabilization . as a result , it is possible to change smoothly the temperature of the sample ( at a rate of about @xmath16 ) without observing significant temperature fluctuations ( always less than @xmath23 ) in the block temperature .",
    "the specific heat is measured using the method previously described@xcite .",
    "the same constant power @xmath24 is dissipated in both heaters ( dissipation branch ) for twelve minutes and a steady state characterized by a constant temperature difference between the sample and the calorimeter block is reached .",
    "the power is then cut off until a new steady state is reached twelve minutes later ( relaxation branch ) .",
    "then , the power is again switched on and the sequence is continuously repeated while the temperature of the assembly is changed at a low constant rate . that is a long - periodic serial of square thermal pulses",
    "is superposed to a heating or cooling ramp .",
    "the temperature increase of the sample due to the thermal pulse of twelve minutes ( circa @xmath25 ) is higher than the temperature variation of the sample produced by the rate of change of temperature in these twelve minutes ( circa @xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , the sample is being cooled and heated alternatively during a run .",
    "the integration of the electromotive force given by the fluxmeter between every pair of steady states allows us to determine sample thermal capacity .",
    "hence , the method is able to determine two data of heat capacity in each cycle . the first one is calculated from the dissipation branch @xmath27 , and the second one from the relaxation branch @xmath28 .",
    "heat capacity obtained in either branch show a regular behaviour if there is no phase transition or if it is continuous . when a discontinuous phase transition occurs , both data become different showing an anomalous behaviour in the temperature interval where the latent heat is produced as a result of the thermal hysteresis and transition kinetics . that behaviour is an evidence of the discontinuous character of the transition@xcite .",
    "incidentally , we must point out that specific heat data are not reliable when this behaviour is observed .",
    "on the other hand , the dta trace is continuously measured in a second run without dissipation in the sample and using the same temperature scanning rate used to measure the specific heat . due to the high number of thermocouples and their good thermal stability of the sample , the equipment works like a very sensitive dta device .",
    "the electromotive force given by the fluxmeters is proportional to the heat flux ,",
    "@xmath29 exchanged between sample and calorimeter block .    from the specific heat data obtained in the first running and using a method previously described@xcite , we calculate the heat flux @xmath30 which would have been due exclusively to the behaviour of the thermal capacity of the sample around the transition temperature . comparing the measured @xmath29 and the calculated @xmath30 we deduce that only in the temperature range ( @xmath31 ) where both data do not coincide there is an effect from the latent heat .",
    "its value is determined by integrating @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the rate of temperature change , between ( @xmath31 ) and using the straight line @xmath34 as baseline@xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the method is estimated to be better than @xmath35 .",
    "the single crystal of was grown at the institute of physics of poznan university ( poland ) .",
    "the sample has @xmath36 mass , with a thickness of @xmath37 along the ferroelectric axis and electrodes circular faces with @xmath38 in surface .",
    "the sample was placed out in the calorimeter .",
    "gold electrodes were evaporated of the surface of the sample ; those electrodes were connected to a capacitance bridge @xmath39 which has allowed us to measure the dielectric permittivity of the sample , simultaneously to the heat flux , with an imposed external bias field of , ,  and .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath40 of a sample of was measured on cooling , on quasiestatic conditions at a scanning temperature rate of ca . @xmath41 using the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental ] for different applied electric fields . in figure",
    "[ fig : uno ] , the specific heat data in a wide temperature interval for different applied electric field ( a ) @xmath42 , ( b ) @xmath43 , ( c ) @xmath44 and ( d ) @xmath45 is shown .",
    "these specific heat data show a linear temperature dependence in the paraelectric phase and for ,  and a sharp @xmath2-type anomaly in a narrow temperature interval is observed . for the maximum",
    "is more rounded and the transition is smeared .",
    "the shape of specific heat curve for high electric field tends to be almost symmetric , such behaviour was also suggested by reese@xcite .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath46 initially increases with increasing field but decreases for sufficiently high values .",
    "as expected , the specific heat tail in the paraelectric phase increases with field as a consequence of the coupling of the order parameter to the field .    in figure 2",
    ", we have plotted the specific heat excess obtained in the dissipation branch ( @xmath47 ) and in the relaxation branch ( @xmath48 ) in a narrow temperature interval , 1 k , for each electric field .",
    "we observed that for ,  and , @xmath47 and @xmath48 data do not coincide around the transition temperature while for both series of data almost coincide in the whole range of temperature . as we have stated above ,",
    "the temperature variation of the sample due to the thermal pulses is slightly higher than the variation due to the temperature ramp .",
    "this means that in every period the temperature of the sample increases and decreases consecutively .",
    "due to thermal hysteresis , to kinetics of the phase transition etc , the process of heating and cooling when two phases coexist is different and consequently data obtained in the dissipation branch and relaxation branch become different under these conditions .",
    "we have reported previously that the difference is very notorious even in systems near the tricritical point , where the latent heat is very small ( l = for kmnf@xmath49 , l = for kmn@xmath50ca@xmath51f@xmath49)@xcite .",
    "hence , in the case of kdp , it is clear from figure  [ fig : dos ] that for ,  and  the phase transition is discontinuous . on the contrary ,",
    "the similar behaviour of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for , figure  [ fig : dos]d , indicate that no trace of latent heat is present , so we can deduce that for  the phase transition is continuous .",
    "hence the critical field lies between  and .        on the other hand ,",
    "the baseline respect which the fluxmeter emf is integrated in order to calculate the specific heat is the underline signal due to the temperature ramp imposed on the calorimeter .",
    "this signal changes very slowly and it does not affect to the specific heat measurement except when a latent heat effect happens .",
    "it produces a non linear variation of the baseline and consequently erroneous data of specific heat may appear .",
    "keeping in mind that the measurements have been carried out in a cooling ramp , in figure  [ fig : dos]a the first @xmath48 at the beginning of the transition which does not coincide with the corresponding @xmath47 data is lower than the regular contribution to the specific heat . in figure",
    "[ fig : dos]b we can also observe such a similar point but this effect is smeared .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : dos]c we can not observe any decrease in @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath48 deviates from @xmath47 in a small range of temperature as in the two previous figures .",
    "hence , we can deduce that latent heat decreases with field and should be very small for .    to confirm this suggestion and to calculate the latent heat , we measured the dta trace in a second run , changing the temperature of the sample at the same constant rate used in the specific heat measurements to make both sets of data comparable .",
    "we must point out that the rate of change of temperature is about two orders of magnitude lower than the minimum value achieved in conventional dta equipments . in figure",
    "[ fig : tres ] , we represent the heat flux given by the fluxmeters @xmath32 ( dta trace ) and the heat flux @xmath52 calculated from the specific heat data , using the method previously described , for the fields @xmath53 ( a ) , @xmath54 ( b ) , @xmath55 ( c ) .    for @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath32 is higher than @xmath52 in a very small temperature interval of about @xmath56 , showing the effect of latent heat . for @xmath32",
    "is also higher than @xmath52 , but the difference between them is smaller , indicating a very small latent heat .",
    "the choosing of the baseline to determine the latent heat value for @xmath53 in graph figure  [ fig : tres]a(i ) is difficult due to the very small temperature interval where the latent heat is present and , consequently , the few data recorded inside that interval . anyway , by considering as baseline the straight line between the extreme temperatures where @xmath32 and @xmath52 coincide , we obtain a value of @xmath57 .",
    "this line is also represented in figure  [ fig : tres]a ) .",
    "the value obtained for kdp deuterated at @xmath58 using the same set - up and procedure was @xcite .    to confirm the validity of that baseline election we again measured the heat flux exchanged by the sample in identical conditions .",
    "those heat flux data are also plotted in the figure  [ fig : tres]a(ii ) .",
    "the figure shows that both heat flux data coincide with @xmath30 ( stars ) in the same range of temperature thus supporting the baseline used for the determination of the latent heat .",
    "in fact , the latent heat for the second run is @xmath59 in good agreement with that of the first one .",
    "on the other hand , these values of the latent heat are in agreement with reese@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that peak area i.e .",
    "latent heat is quite reproducible despite the kinetic effects that showed each experiment . on the contrary ,",
    "the difference observed if @xmath60 during the phase transitions suggests the existence of non - equilibrium kinetic process as those expected for a discontinuous phase transition for instance phase front generation which , as a general fact , are nonreproducible .",
    "for @xmath61 and @xmath62 we decreased the scanning rate of temperature when measuring specific heat so as to get a higher number of data points in the neighborhood of the phase transition .",
    "hence , the determination of the baseline becomes easier as shown in figure  [ fig : tres ] .",
    "the integration of the peaks gives @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the obtained result confirm that latent heat diminishes with electric field ( see figure  [ fig : seis ] ) . at  latent heat",
    "is reduced by and order of magnitude with respect to that of zero field and it is close to the critical field . assuming a linear behaviour of the latent heat with the field we deduce that the critical field lies on @xmath65 .     at various electric fields .",
    "critical field is found to be @xmath0 ]      in order to relate calorimetric and dielectric behaviour the dielectric permittivity along the ferroelectric axis has been measured simultaneously to the heat flux .    . ]    in figure  [ fig : cuatro ] we represent @xmath67 for the different electric fields .",
    "the dielectric permittivity increases in all cases during the phase transition following the curie law . in the ferroelectric phase",
    "the dielectric permittivity remains in a plateau , indicating also the large domain wall contribution to the dielectric permittivity , but the maximum of permittivity decreases with the applied electric field .",
    "it has been previously reported that the maximum value of dielectric permittivity is due to the contribution of domain wall @xcite ; under electric field the sample becomes close to monodomain state , so number of domain walls decrease and also does the dielectric permittivity .",
    "nevertheless the behaviour at transition temperature is different for @xmath53 and @xmath54 discontinuous transition than for @xmath55 close - to - critical - point transition and @xmath68 continuous transition. we will relate in figure  [ fig : cinco ] the shape of dielectric permittivity for @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",

    "three regions may be distinguish in this figure : ( i ) the paraelectric phase where the permittivity follows the curie law , ( ii ) the phase transformation interval where the permittivity slightly deviates from the previous behaviour and ( iii ) the ferroelectric phase where the permittivity shows a plateau . we must point out that the maximum of the permittivity matches with the end of phase transformation .    for @xmath55 , @xmath67 shows a different behaviour see figure  [ fig : cinco](b). at the transition temperature it is present a minimum .",
    "this has been observed by bornarel@xcite in crystals of kdp for higher values of electric field ( about ) . in that work bornarel",
    "explains this behaviour in terms of some domains arrangements during the phase transition ; @xmath67 is described as the sum of the behaviour of @xmath71 contribution that correspond to the behaviour of monodomain sample , and the corresponding @xmath72 due to the contributions of domains .",
    "moreover @xmath71 increases from paraelectric phase and after the maximum at transition temperature decreases to zero in ferroelectric phase ; @xmath72 increases from zero at transition temperature and remains in a plateau in ferroelectric phase .",
    "the sum of both contributions gives the appearance of @xmath67 in figure  [ fig : cinco]b .",
    "it may be seen also from the results presented on figure  [ fig : cinco ] that the peak of the heat flux at transition temperature appear at temperature where the production of domains become dominant .",
