    "recently the icecube neutrino observatory  @xcite for the first time showed the existence of high - energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "since neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields in our universe , they should point back to their original source .",
    "this opens a new field in physics , the field of neutrino astronomy . at the highest energies , these cosmic neutrinos are extremely rare . at energies above several pev , icecube runs out of events and an even larger detector volume than the 1  km@xmath0 covered by icecube",
    "is needed for their detection . due to the long attenuation length of the radio signal ,",
    "the radio detection technique is an excellent candidate to detect these rare events .",
    "several radio detectors have been developed to detect the radio emission from neutrino - induced particle cascades in ice and moon rock  [ 2 - 10 ] .",
    "these are based on the emission from a net electron excess which develops when the particle cascade evolves , the askaryan effect  @xcite .",
    "the askaryan radio - emission mechanism has been confirmed experimentally at slac  @xcite and in the radio emission from air showers  @xcite .",
    "the askaryan radio detection experiments have been developed to detect the gzk neutrino flux  @xcite , which should arise from the interaction of high - energy protons ( @xmath1  ev ) interacting with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "therefore , these detectors start to have large effective volumes for cascade inducing particles having energies in the eev region and above , where the gzk flux is expected .",
    "it follows that there is an energy gap between icecube , which is sensitive below several pev , and the askaryan radio detectors which start to have large effective volumes at eev energies . in this article , we discuss the radar detection technique as a possible method to bridge this important energy region between several pev and a few eev .    the concept of radar detection of cosmic - ray - induced particle cascades in air dates back to the 1940s of the previous century .",
    "blacket and lovel  @xcite proposed to use the radar detection technique to measure these cosmic - ray - induced air showers .",
    "initial experimental attempts using the radar technique were done , but no conclusive evidence for the detection of air showers was found .",
    "it would take another 50 years before the interest in this subject was renewed  @xcite .",
    "this triggered several new modeling attempts  @xcite and experiments [ 25 - 30 ] .",
    "even - though a first possible detection of a cosmic - ray - induced air shower might have been observed  @xcite , no conclusive evidence for such a detection has been obtained so - far .",
    "next to the efforts done for the radar detection of cosmic - ray air showers , recently suggestions were made to measure the reflection of radio waves from particle cascades induced in rock salt and ice  @xcite .    with the existing infrastructure already available at the different askaryan radio detection sites such as ara  @xcite and arianna  @xcite , in this article",
    ", we discuss the radar detection technique for the detection of high - energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "an energy threshold for the primary cascade inducing particle is derived for coherent scattering of the over - dense plasma region .",
    "the over - dense plasma region is defined by the condition that the detection frequency is below the plasma frequency , where the plasma frequency scales with the electron density . in this regime",
    ", the incoming radio signal does not penetrate the plasma and scatters of the surface of the plasma tube .",
    "this brings a great advantage of ice as a medium over air .",
    "the volume in which the particle cascade is confined decreases dramatically in ice , resulting in higher plasma frequencies .",
    "it should be noted however , that it is also possible to scatter of the individual electrons in the under - dense plasma .",
    "currently , most of the existing radar facilities for the detection of air showers are based on the detection of the under - dense plasma .    in the first section ,",
    "we discuss the particle cascade and the induced ionization plasma .",
    "we discuss results obtained experimentally by irradiating ice with 3  mev electrons and x - rays , where it is found that next to the ionization electrons , a long - lived plasma exists which is attributed to free protons  @xcite . in the following we use the experimentally obtained lifetime of these plasmas to determine an energy threshold for the radar detection of the over - dense plasma region .",
    "finally , we conclude by calculating the radar return power for the different components of the plasma .",
    "this allows us to determine the maximum detection range for different values of the radar power considering two different cascade geometries .",
    "when a high - energy cosmic neutrino interacts in the medium a cascade of secondary particles is induced . to model the electromagnetic cascade we use a heitler model @xcite , stating that every interaction length @xmath2 , the total number of particles doubles and their average energy is split",
    "this goes on up to the critical energy where the brems - strahlung , and creation - annihilation cross - sections become small compared to the ionization cross - sections .",
    "the critical energy of electrons in ice and their radiation length is given by , e_c&=&0.0786 + x_0&=&36.08 .",
    "+ l_0&=&=39.22 where the ice density is assumed to be constant and equal to @xmath3 . using the radiation length @xmath4 ,",
    "the interaction length is given by , @xmath5 .",
    "now following the heitler model stating that every radiation length the total number of particles is doubled and their energy is split , we can make an estimate for the maximum number of particles in the shower and the shower length .",
    "the maximum number of particles in the cascade can be estimated by , n_max&= & + & = & 12.72e_p [ ] .",
    "[ eq : heit ] a more realistic shower development is given by the nkg parameterization , developed by kamata and nishimura @xcite , and greisen  @xcite .",
    "it follows ( see appendix a ) that the maximum number of particles in the heitler model is overestimated by a factor of 10 independent of energy in the tev to eev energy range .",
    "therefore , in the following we will consider , n_max^nkg=1.27e_p [ ] .",
    "the shower maximum is reached after @xmath6 divisions , leading to an estimate for the shower length of , l_c&=&n + & = & l_0(e_p / e_c ) + & & 0.4(12.72e_p [ ] ) .",
    "[ eq : length ] this is the length it takes for the cascade to reach its maximum , the total length will therefore in general be at least a factor of two longer . in  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the shower length is plotted as a function of primary energy from 1 tev to 1 eev and is found to be of the order of 5 - 10 meters .",
    "this corresponds well to the values obtained using the nkg parameterization ( see appendix a ) . it should be noted that we ignore the lpm effect  @xcite which becomes significant above pev - eev energies  @xcite , giving rise to an increased shower length .     given in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : length ] ) , as a function of the energy of the primary shower inducing particle . ]",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    so - far , we discussed the high - energy electron - positron pairs in the shower front . nevertheless , we will not focus on this high energetic shower front for the radar detection of the cascade .",
    "this is mainly due to two reasons , one is that the particle density is too low , the second is that the shower front is very narrow such that we would need to measure at very high frequencies .",
    "more interesting are the low - energy ionization electrons left behind when the shower front has passed .",
    "the ionization energy of ice can be estimated as @xmath7 . assuming that most of the energy loss of the electrons or positrons goes into ionization , the energy lost in one radiation length at the shower maximum equals @xmath8  mev per high energy electron in the shower front .",
    "hence the number of ionization electrons created by a single high energy electron equals @xmath9 . the total number of ionization electrons created is thus given by , n_e^tot&&=n_maxn^ion + & & = 8.8010 ^ 4e_p [ ] to convert the line density to a volume density , we need to consider the radial particle distribution in the cascade .",
    "this is modeled by modifying the parameterization used in  @xcite , which was originally developed for air showers , w(r)=()^s-1(+1)^s-4.5 , the shower age parameter is taken to be its value at the shower maximum , @xmath10 , and the distance parameter @xmath11  cm is converted using its value in air . more details can be found in appendix b. in  fig .",

    "these numbers are obtained by irradiating a block of ice with x - rays and 3 mev electrons .",
    "the total number of free electrons was accordingly measured for an absorbed dose of 20  mrad in the @xmath17 ice sample , corresponding to an integrated energy slightly larger than @xmath18  ev .",
    "the total number of conduction electrons was found to be @xmath19 electrons .",
    "since we consider a source moving at the speed of light , to compare the density , we have to use the dimensions of the plasma tube considered in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , in the previous section we only considered the energy lost in a single radiation length for @xmath14 of the particles . taking these factors into account , the corresponding density becomes @xmath20 , which is slightly larger than the value obtained from  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    in",
    "@xcite it was also shown that the electron plasma has a lifetime of the order of 100  ps at relatively high temperatures close to the freezing point which increases to tens of nanoseconds at temperatures below -60@xmath21 celcius , also depending on the amount impurities in the ice .",
    "even - though ice temperatures found for example at the south - pole are rather low and of the order of -50@xmath21 celcius , in the following we will assume a conservative value of 1  ns .",
    "more interesting , next to the free ( mobile ) ionization electrons a conduction transient with a much longer lifetime of the order of 10  ns to @xmath22 was observed  @xcite .",
    "this conduction transient is attributed to free ( mobile ) protons , where the assumption was made that the total number of protons is equal to the total number of ionization electrons , @xmath23 . in the following sections",
    ", we will keep this assumption .",
    "the most important properties to determine if radar can be used to detect a plasma are the plasma frequency , @xmath24 , the plasma lifetime @xmath25 , and the length of the plasma tube @xmath26 . for all frequencies below the plasma frequency , the radio signal does not penetrate the plasma and scatters of the surface of the plasma tube . next to the plasma frequency , also the lifetime and dimensions of the plasma cloud are important .",
    "if the lifetime of the plasma is smaller than @xmath27 or the length of the plasma tube is smaller than @xmath28 , the speed of light in the medium divided by the plasma frequency , the plasma will not be able to make a full oscillation and re - emit the incoming signal .",

    "the free electrons become trapped at lattice defects in the ice within the very short time span of 1  ns  @xcite . after the decay of these free electrons ,",
    "still a conductivity transient was observed with a lifetime of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds  @xcite .",
    "this effect was attributed to free protons left behind in the medium .",
    "it follows that we can also expect a long - lived plasma with similar properties from a high - energy - neutrino induced shower in ice .",
    "in this situation the condition @xmath35 is not fulfilled for the longest lifetimes and the plasma frequency is bounded by @xmath36 . taking a conservative value of @xmath37  m",
    ", we obtain @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that due to the longer lifetime of the plasma , it is possible to detect it at lower frequencies in the mhz band . what is the plasma frequency for these free protons ? we can express the plasma frequency for a charge of mass @xmath39 with respect to the electron mass @xmath40 as , _ p=_e . for protons ,",

    "leading to an energy threshold of approximately 20  pev , which is slightly larger than for the free electrons .",
    "to determine the feasibility for radar detection of high - energy neutrino induced particle cascades in the ice , we first need to determine the return power of a signal transmitted with power @xmath42 . in the far - field , the radiated power measured at a distance @xmath43 from the transmitter will fall off isotropically like @xmath44 .",
    "the maximum length of the plasma tube is given by the shower length @xmath26 shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",

    "we now consider a bi - static radar configuration with the transmitter located at the top of the ice - sheet .",
    "using a beamed transmission into the ice in the direction of the receiving antennas , we gain a factor of 4 over isotropic transmission and the power drops like @xmath45 .",
    "it should be noticed that due to the gradient of the ice density the signal will be bend into the ice preventing the direct signal from reaching the receiver , and we do not have to worry about separating the direct signal from a possible reflection . in case of reflection",
    ", the signal is absorbed over the effective area of the plasma @xmath46 and re - transmitted isotropically to the receiving antennas giving an additional factor @xmath44 , after which the signal is detected over an effective area , @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , at high frequencies , we have to consider the attenuation of the signal in the medium .",
    "the received power in this situation is given by , p_r = p_te^-4r / l _ , where following  @xcite we insert an additional efficiency factor @xmath48 which is estimated to be @xmath49 .",
    "the attenuation is determined by the frequency dependent attenuation parameter @xmath50 .",
    "note that we assumed the distance from the transmitting antenna to the plasma , @xmath43 , equal to the distance from the plasma to the receiving antenna .",
    "the total distance covered by the signal is therefore given by @xmath51 .",
    "this leads us with the determination of the effective area for isotropic transmission of the plasma tube , @xmath46 , also called the radar cross - section , the effective area of the receiving antenna , @xmath47 , and the frequency dependent attenuation parameter @xmath52 . following  @xcite ,",
    "the maximum radar cross - section for a wave at normal incidence on a thin wire is estimated by , _ eff^max ( ) , which is a function of the polarization angle @xmath53 , the radius of the particle distribution @xmath54  cm , and the length of the plasma tube @xmath55  m for the electron plasma and @xmath56  m for the proton plasma . at an angle @xmath57 away from normal",

    "therefore , we will put @xmath61 and absorb the constant @xmath60 into the efficiency @xmath49 .",
    "this leaves us with the determination of the frequency dependent attenuation parameter @xmath52 for radio waves in ice . in  @xcite measurements of the electric field attenuation length for",
    "vertically transmitted radio signals at the ross ice - shelf are described .",
    "this is done by measuring the attenuation over a round - trip distance of 1155  m. a parameterization of the attenuation parameter @xmath62 is given by , = 469 - 0.205 + 4.8710 ^ -5 ^ 2 , [ eq : att ] where the frequency @xmath63 is given in mhz .",
    "the parameterization is based on measurements between 75 and 1250  mhz , therefore an extrapolation has to be made to determine @xmath64 at 50  mhz .",
    "it should be noted that the obtained attenuation length is fitted specifically for the ross ice - shelf , and differs for example from the attenuation length measured by the ara collaboration at the south - pole  @xcite , which is found to be around a kilometer at 300  mhz .",
    "one of the effects we did not consider so - far is the skin effect .",
    "an electromagnetic wave impinging a conducting material will be attenuated when penetrating the conductor .",
    "a measure for this attenuation is the skin depth , after which the flux density of the signal has dropped by a factor @xmath65 . neglecting energy dissipation due to collisions which typically occurs at a lower frequencies ,",
    "the skin depth is given by  @xcite , = , where @xmath66 denotes the speed of light and @xmath67 is the plasma frequency .",
    "a conductor becomes opaque when its size is significantly smaller than the skin depth .",
    "in opposite , a conductor becomes highly reflective when detecting at frequencies well below the plasma frequency , in the situation where the skin depth is small compared to the dimension of the plasma .",
    "considering an isotropic particle density within the plasma tube , close to the determined energy threshold the skin depth will be large compared to the lateral dimensions of the plasma tube , decreasing rapidly toward higher energies .",
    "therefore , additional loss in the reflected signal can be expected as function of the plasma frequency and hence of the energy of the primary cascade inducing particle .",
    "nevertheless , this is under the assumptions of an isotropic particle distribution . in reality , this distribution is highly peaked toward small radial distances as can be seen in  fig .",
    "[ fig : figa2 ] , and it can be shown that at energies close to the threshold energy there will still be a highly reflective tube which is of smaller lateral dimensions than considered in our calculation . a detailed description of the efficiency loss due to skin effects goes beyond the scope of this paper and we intend to include this in a future work . possible inefficiencies due to the skin effect will therefore be absorbed in our efficiency factor @xmath48 , which thus in principle should depend on frequency .",

    "with respect to the background , the return power would gain a factor equal to the number of receiving antennas . in case of the ara setup",
    "this would thus immediately give an additional factor of 30 for the return power with respect to the background noise .",

    "the shower age @xmath89 is given by , s(x)=. [ eq : age ]    ) .",
    "the cascade is modeled at three different energies , 1  tev , 1  pev , and 1  eev .",
    "it follows that the total number of particles scales approximately linear with energy and is given 0.1 times the value obtained using the heitler approximation  eq .",

    "[ fig : figa1 ] , the shower development is plotted at tev , pev and eev energies . furthermore , we plot the maximum number of particles as given by the heitler approximation obtained in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : heit ] ) .",
    "it follows that using the heitler approximation , the number of particles at the shower maximum is overestimated by a factor of 10 . the shower length shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , defined as the length it takes for the shower to reach its maximum corresponds well to length obtained by the nkg parameterization .",
    "for the radial particle distribution we will modify the parameterization obtained in  @xcite for cosmic - ray - induced air showers . this parameterization is given as function of the radial distance @xmath90 in meters .",
    "assuming radial symmetry @xmath91 , the radial particle distribution is parameterized as , w(r)=()^s-1(+1)^s-4.5 , where @xmath10 corresponds to the shower age at the shower maximum .",
    "the second parameter is the distance parameter @xmath92 , which for air is approximately given by @xmath93  m. from  eq .",
    "( [ eq : age ] ) it follows that the shower age parameter @xmath89 is a function of depth @xmath94 , and @xmath10 at the shower maximum in both ice and air .",
    "the distance parameter @xmath95 is given in meters . to convert this distance to ice",
    ", we first have to convert it to radiation length , x^air&=&r_0^air^air + & = & 6.4 . where we approximated the air density @xmath96 at 4  km height corresponding to the position of the air shower maximum .",
    "since the electron radiation length in air @xmath97 differs only slightly from its value in ice @xmath98 , we assume @xmath99 .",
