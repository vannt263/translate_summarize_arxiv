    "weak links consisting of superconducting ( s ) and normal metal ( n ) parts separated by insulators ( i ) are the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "transport through these systems is determined by several factors , such as transparency of the contacts , specifics of the weak link area and energy relaxation in the junction , leading to a series of nonlinear characteristics in the current - voltage relation . in stationary regime , numerous configurations have been analyzed ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for review ) , revealing the importance of both andreev @xcite and normal reflection processes taking place in the contact .    when the injection rate of new particles into the junction is greater than the corresponding rate of inelastic relaxation the nonequilibrium effects are to be taken into account",
    ". in realistic junctions with high current density and especially at low temperatures the inelastic relaxation may become less effective , resulting in a strong nonequilibrium which crucially affects the current transported through the contact . for even a small bias voltage below the energy gap",
    ", the oscillating josephson supercurrent may be accompanied with a nonzero dc component corresponding to the dissipative processes .",
    "nonequilibrium situations in various sinis - type junctions ranging from a point contact to a ballistic junction with finite length have been studied by many authors , the discussion to some extent has also concerned@xcite the inelastic relaxation effects . as is well known ,",
    "the dc component exhibits a subgap structure at bias voltages @xmath0 which is associated with multiple andreev reflections ( mar)@xcite . the quasiparticles trapped in the junction are accelerated by the applied voltage , while , for each cycle of repeated electron - hole reflections at the two ns interfaces , the energy of the particle increases by @xmath1 until the accumulated energy enables it to escape the pair - potential well .",
    "this works in a broad voltage range , but becomes more and more complicated when relaxation effects are included or the transparency at the interfaces differs from unity . the low - voltage mar process for @xmath2 in a ballistic contact is equivalent to the spectral flow along the andreev energy levels @xcite where the phase difference @xmath3 adiabatically depends on time @xmath4 .",
    "however , for a non - ideal transparency , the energy levels are separated from each other by minigaps ( see the next section ) which suppress the transitions from one level to the next thus cutting the spectral flow off . as a result , for very low voltages ,",
    "the dc current is small for contacts with any realistic transparency @xmath5 .",
    "the interlevel transitions can take place by means of zener tunneling near the avoided crossings of the andreev levels ; they restore the spectral flow and give rise to a finite dissipative dc current .",
    "the zener processes are more simple in short junctions ( point contacts ) where only two andreev states corresponding to particles travelling in opposite directions exist ; these levels have only one minigap at the phase difference @xmath6 .",

    "we derive the effective kinetic equation for the quasiparticle distribution on the andreev levels taking into account both the inelastic relaxation on each level and the zener transitions between the neighboring levels and demonstrate that the voltage - driven zener transitions from one level to the next enhance the action of each other and lead to a drastic increase of the dc current as the transition probability grows with the applied voltage .",
