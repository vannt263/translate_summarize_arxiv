    "according to the most widely accepted scenario of galaxy formation many globular clusters ( gcs ) populating the halo of the milky way formed in satellite galaxies accreted in the past by our galaxy ( searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "such a hypothesis , originally suggested by the lack of an abundance gradient in the gcs at galactocentric distances @xmath3 kpc , is also supported by many pieces of circumstantial evidence : the presence of an age - metallicity relation among the `` young '' clusters at large distances from the galactic center ( marn - franch et al .",
    "2009 ) , their peculiar kinematical properties ( large , energetic orbits of high eccentricity ) , larger core radii and higher specific frequency of rr lyrae stars ( mackey & gilmore 2004 ) . the fundamental concept of this picture is also consistent with theoretical ideas of the hierarchical formation of structures on galactic scales ( white & rees 1978 ) and it should therefore hold in other massive galaxies . the evidence of a clear correlation between the large coherent streams in the outer halo of m31 and the position of its gcs seems to confirm this picture ( mackey et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the typical event of late accretion",
    "the satellite is progressively disrupted by the galactic tidal strain and the stripped particles ( stars / clusters/ dark matter ) continue to move on orbits similar to that of the original galaxy , hence forming multiple filamentary wraps around the parent galaxy ( see law , johnston & majewski 2005 ) .",
    "on the basis of these considerations , the stellar population of the host galaxy should still be visible in the surroundings of these gcs ( van den berg 2000 ) as a compact overdensity of objects in the phase - space distribution .",
    "such a direct evidence of association of gcs to confirmed streams have been noticed for some gc ( e.g. pal 12 and ngc4147 associated to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2002 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2003a ) while many other candidates have been proposed to be associated with the sagittarius galaxy ( dinescu et al .",
    "2000 ; bellazzini , ferraro & ibata 2003b ) , the monoceros ring ( crane et al . 2003 ; frinchaboy et al .",
    "2004 ) and the canis major overdensity ( martin et al .",
    "2004a ) .    an intriguing case is represented by the gc ngc1851 : this cluster is part , together with ngc1904 , ngc2298 and ngc2808 , of an apparent system of gcs confined in a sphere with radius 6 kpc ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2003b ) with positions which are compatible with the predicted orbital path of the canis major stream ( martin et al .",
    "2004a , conn et al . 2005 ) . in their discovery paper ,",
    "martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) suggested that the same episode of accretion which produced the canis major overdensity was also responsible for the monoceros ring feature previously observed by newberg ( 2002 ) .",
    "n - body simulations by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicate that the debris of a satellite with the kinematical properties of monoceros would indeed align along the line - of - sight of ngc1851 , but the predicted radial velocity of the stream ( @xmath4 ) would not be compatible with its association with the cluster .",
    "however , the nature of these substructures have been questioned by some authors who claimed that the observed overdensities could be due to the galactic warp ( momany et al .",
    "2004 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) and/or flare ( momany et al . 2006",

    "2012 ) are better explained by two originally distinct clusters .",
    "they concluded that ngc1851 could be formed by the merger of two gcs , an occurrence that is largely unlikely within the milky way but more frequent within dwarf galaxies ( van den bergh 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , recent photometric analyses ( olszewski et al . 2009 ) have also reported that the shape of the density profile of this cluster deviates from the typical king profile , showing a power - law decline visible up to 20@xmath0 from the cluster center ( see also carballo - bello et al .",

    "we randomly associated a synthetic object to each target according to their euclidean distance in the b vs. r plane .",
    "a random gaussian distributed shift with dispersion equal to the velocity error of each target has been then added to each synthetic object .",

    "the distribution has been then normalized to the observed one requiring the same number of stars at velocities @xmath26 ( where only field stars are expected ) .",
    "it is apparent that both the stream and the ngc1851 peaks are not reproduced by the galactic model of robin et al .",
    "the peaks shown in fig .",
    "[ distr ] remain apparent even when different choices of the bin width are made ( @xmath27 ) . in the following analysis we defined two samples of stars in the radial velocity range @xmath28 ( encompassing the `` stream peak '' ) and @xmath29 ( around the `` ngc1851 peak '' ) , and a `` field sample '' containing the remaining stars .",
    "they contain 15 , 17 and 75 stars , respectively .",
    "the comparison with the galactic model indicates an expected contamination from galactic interlopers of @xmath30 stars in the `` stream '' sample and @xmath31 stars in the `` ngc1851 '' one .",
    "so , assuming poisson fluctuations in number counts , the statistical significances of the `` stream '' and `` ngc1851 '' peaks are 2.2 and 3.4 @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the above significances , in particular that of the `` stream peak '' , are slightly sensitive to the normalization of the galactic model to the observed data : in the extreme assumption of a normalization to the number of targets over the entire velocity range ( instead of the above quoted range @xmath26 ) the significances of the `` stream '' and `` ngc1851 '' peaks would decrease to 1.6 and 3.3 sigma , respectively .",
    "we then performed a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( independent on the normalization of the two samples ) : the probability that the observed velocity distribution and that predicted by the robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model are drawn from the same population turns out to be 0.003% .",
    "if we exclude the stars of the `` stream peak '' the probability decreases below @xmath33 , while excluding the stars of the `` ngc1851 '' peak we obtain a probability of 3.6% .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion of the two peaks are @xmath34 and @xmath35 i.e. comparable with the observational uncertainty .",
    "this suggests that these features are kinematically cold ( with an intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath1 ) .    in figure [ cmd ] the location of the stars of the `` stream peak '' and of the `` ngc1851 peak '' in the b , b - r color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "are shown .",
    "it can be noted that the stars of the `` ngc1851 peak '' nicely follow the mean ridge line of the cluster populating the cluster ms region .",
    "the distribution of the `` stream peak '' stars is instead more scattered covering the entire range of magnitudes of the sample while being confined in a narrow range in color ( @xmath36 ) , partly overlapping the red side of the ms of ngc1851 .    fig .",
    "[ ks ] shows the cumulative radial distribution of the three groups of stars ( field , stream and ngc1851 ) as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",
    "note that the stars of the `` ngc1851 '' sample are more concentrated toward the cluster center with respect to those of the other groups : a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates a probability of less than 0.2% that the field and ngc1851 samples are extracted from the same population .",
    "the same result can be deduced by splitting the sample in two subsets according to their distance from the cluster center ( @xmath37 ) and calculating the double - normalized ratio between the number of objects in the `` ngc1851 '' and `` field '' samples contained in the inner and outer subsamples @xmath38 note that the bestfit of the density profile provided by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) using a wilson ( 1975 ) model and that provided by carballo - bello et al .",
    "( 2012 ) with the power - law empirical relation by elson , fall & freeman ( 1987 ) predict @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the same radial range , respectively .",
    "so , in spite of the large errors involved , there seems to be an overabundace of cluster members beyond 20@xmath0 from the cluster center with respect to the model predictions .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of objects prevents from any conclusion on the radial distribution of the `` stream '' sample .",
    "also , no clear signatures of azimuthal variation of velocities have been found in the three samples .",
    "note that the velocity variation of a cold stream over the field of view covered by our observations should not exceed few @xmath21 ( pearrubia et al .",

    "an intriguing possibility is that it is a debris of an accreted satellite in the direction of ngc1851 . in this section",
    "we try to estimate the distance and the surface brightness of this feature , in the hypothesis that it is constituted by the debris of the monoceros ring .    for this purpose",
    ", we simulated a synthetic cmd of the satellite by randomly extracting a population of stars from a kroupa ( 2001 ) mass function and interpolating through a set of marigo et al .",

    "2008 ; meisner et al . 2012 ) and a reddening of e(b - v)=0.04 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .    to estimate the distance of the stream we performed an iterative weighted fit of the location of the `` stream '' sample stars with the same isochrone used to compute the synthetic cmd .",
    "as a first step we chose a first guess of the distance modulus and converted absolute magnitudes to apparent ones .",
    "for each star a weight has been then calculated as the ratio between the densities of stars at the target ( b , b - r ) position in the synthetic satellite cmd and in the robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) galactic model cmd .",
    "only stars in the `` stream sample '' velocity range have been used to calculate the galactic field density .",

    "equal to the velocity error of each target has been then added to the synthetic velocities to mimic the observational errors .",
    "the number of objects falling in the velocity range of the `` stream sample '' has been then counted and the surface brightness of the satellite has been estimated by summing the v fluxes of all the simulated sources .",
    "the procedure has been repeated 100 times for each adopted number of satellite object and the distribution in the @xmath48 plane is shown in fig . [ sb ] .",
    "as expected , the brighter is the adopted satellite the larger is the number of stars in the `` stream '' range of velocity , while at surface brightness lower than @xmath49 the number of objects in the interesting velocity range asymptotically tends to the number of halo stars .",
    "the mean surface brightness to observe 15 object turns out to be @xmath50 .",
    "we report the results of a survey of radial velocities in the outskirts of the gc ngc1851 .",
    "we clearly detect the signal of the cluster stellar population as a strong overdensity of objects with a velocity and location in the cmd compatible with that of the cluster ms , and more concentrated with respect to the galactic field population .",
    "such a detection confirms that a significant number of cluster stars are present up to 25@xmath0 from the cluster center , well beyond the king tidal radius , as already reported by olszewski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and carballo - bello et al .",
    "it is worth noting that the truncation radius predicted by dynamical models depends on their adopted functional form of the distribution function , a choice which is somehow arbitrary .",
    "for instance , mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) showed that wilson ( 1975 ) models , predicting larger tidal radii with respect to king ( 1966 ) ones , better fit the overall shape of many gcs . for ngc1851 the tidal radius estimated by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) using wilson ( 1975 ) models is 44.7@xmath0 , well beyond the extent of our dataset . anisotropy and mass segregation can also play a role in shaping the radial density profile of the cluster ( gunn & griffin 1979 ) .",
    "however , a physical ( model - independent ) limit to the distance of bound stars is given by the jacobi radius at which equilibrium between the effective potentials of the cluster and of the host galaxy settles .",
    "allen , moreno & pichardo ( 2006 ) estimated a jacobi radius of @xmath51 for ngc1851 .",
    "thus , the outermost targets observed here could be unbound objects .",
    "also in this case , however , caution must be taken since the estimate of the jacobi radius depends on the adopted cluster orbital parameters and on the galactic potential , which are subject to significant uncertainties .",
    "even if all the detected cluster stars would be comprised within the jacobi radius the relative fraction of object at @xmath52 exceeds the prediction of all the commonly used dynamical models .",
    "the overabundance of these object can be explained assuming these stars to be `` potential escapers '' i.e. stars whose orbital energy already exceeded the potential of the lagrangian point but whose orbits have still not intersected it ( kpper et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this scenario",
    ", these stars are expected to have also a velocity dispersion significantly larger than those predicted by dynamical models .",
    "unfortunately , the small sample size and the relatively large uncertainties of our data do not allow to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that these objects have been heated by the relaxation process after the last cluster orbital pericentric passage , moving over the tidal boundary ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .",
    "we also found a peak at @xmath53 not predicted by the galactic model of robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) corresponding to a cold ( @xmath54 ) population of stars whose location in the cmd is compatible with a distance of @xmath510 kpc and a surface brightness of @xmath50 .",
    "note that the deepest wide - field photometric analyses of this cluster reached a surface brightness limit of @xmath55 ( olszewski et al .",
    "2009 ; carballo - bello et al .",
    "2012 ) and could not detect such a feature .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the significance of such a peak is 2.2 @xmath32 , leaving a 1.5% probability of false detection ( 3.6% according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "a non - optimal wavelength calibration of the spectra can also introduce some artifact in the velocity distribution , although it is not expected to produce a spurious peak .",
    "moreover , it is also possible that the galactic model of robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) underpredicts the fraction of stars in the velocity interval around 180 @xmath22 ( constituted almost exclusively by halo stars ) by a factor of two .",
    "however , the mean velocity and the relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath56 ) of this object makes impossible a connection with the warped / flared disk ( see sect .",
    "[ intro_sec ] ) .",
    "if confirmed this evidence would constitute a strong indication of the presence of a stream in the direction of ngc1851 .",
    "an identification of this feature with known streams is not easy because of the large uncertainties in the orbit of these satellites .",
    "the prediction for the monoceros stream of the n - body model by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicates that a high latitude debris of this stream should align with ngc1851 at a distance compatible with the range estimated here ( including the ngc1851 , see fig .",
    "[ mon ] ) . however , the connection of this cluster with the stream is unlikely because of the large velocity difference between these two objects ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the velocity difference between the `` stream '' sample identified here and the prediction for the monoceros ( @xmath58 ) seems to exclude also a connection between them .",
    "note however that our observations are located far away from the kinematical detection used by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to constrain the monoceros orbit , so many uncertainties ( including the adopted galactic potential ) make this comparison uncertain . unfortunately , the small sample size and the low resolution of our data prevent us a statistically significant detection .",

    "<S> the radial velocities of 107 stars in a region between 12@xmath0 and 33@xmath0 around the cluster have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly identify the cluster stellar population over the entire field of view , indicating the presence of a significant fraction of stars outside the tidal radius predicted by king models . </S>",
    "<S> we also find tentative evidence of a cold ( @xmath1 ) peak in the distribution of velocities at @xmath2 constituted mainly by main sequence stars whose location in the color - magnitude diagram is compatible with a stream at a similar distance of this cluster . if confirmed , this evidence would strongly support the extra - galactic origin of this feature .    </S>",
