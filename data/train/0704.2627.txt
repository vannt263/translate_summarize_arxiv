    ", the bragg condition softens and there may be significant scattering into other than the desired orders .",
    "moreover , couplings between the nonzero diffraction orders may lead to phase shifts of the diffracted waves @xcite , which is undesirable in many applications .    in this work",
    ", we present an analytic treatment of such quasi bragg scattering .",
    "we will find that by prudent choice of the scattering potential and its envelope function , behavior very similar to bragg scattering , in particular very low losses and phase shifts , can be obtained for scatterers that substantially violate the assumptions of the simplified theory .",
    "bragg diffraction famously provides us with the basic knowledge of the structure of crystals , including proteins .",
    "it is also important for many technical applications , like acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) @xcite , distributed bragg reflectors ( dbr ) in diode @xcite and fiber lasers as well as photonic bandgap crystals @xcite .",
    "moreover , bragg diffraction is a basic method for making surface acoustic wave ( saw ) filters in radio frequency technology . in atomic physics ,",

    "moreover , bragg diffraction can act as a beam splitter for matter waves @xcite .",
    "the highest order diffraction so far achieved with matter waves seems to be by koolen _",
    "@xcite , who obtained up to eighth - order bragg diffraction .",
    "atom interferometers based on bragg diffraction include the one by giltner _",

    "see @xcite .",
    "while not all the atom interferometers just cited use bragg diffraction , high - order bragg diffraction offers several interesting possibilities for atom interferometers : ( i ) it makes the atom interact with @xmath1 photons at once , which may increase the sensitivity of the interferometer by a factor of @xmath2 @xcite relative to the @xmath3 photon transitions .",
    "( we note here that other possibilities exist for using high - order transitions in atom interferometers , like applying multiple low - order pulses @xcite , operation in the raman - nath regime @xcite or the magneto - optical beam splitter @xcite ) ( ii ) since bragg diffraction theoretically allows coherent momentum transfer with an efficiency close to one , it allows the insertion of many @xmath4-pulses for additional momentum transfer , which increases the signal in photon recoil measurements @xcite ( up to @xmath5 @xmath4-pulses based on two - photon adiabatic transfer were used in @xcite , transferring @xmath6 photon momenta ; if these had been 5-th order bragg pulses , they would have transferred 300 ) .",
    "( iii ) if losses can be neglected , bragg diffraction is basically a transition in a 2-level system .",

    "blackie and ballagh @xcite explore the use of bragg diffraction in probing vortices in becs .    on the other hand , the picture is still incomplete in the quasi - bragg regime we are concerned with .",

    "_ @xcite consider both the raman - nath and the bragg regime using a bloch - state approach ; for the bragg regime , however , their treatment is restricted to the first diffraction order and square envelopes .",
    "bord and lmmerzahl @xcite give and exhaustive treatment of square - envelope scattering that is based on matching the boundary conditions at the beginning and end of the pulse .",
    "this method , unfortunately , can not readily be generalized to smooth envelope functions .",
    "the mathieu equation formalism is a powerful tool for studying diffraction with arbitrary potential depth and interaction times , as demonstrated by horne , jex , and zeilinger @xcite . however , like the work of bord and lmmerzahl , the mathieu equation formalism assumes constant envelopes and can not readily be generalized to smooth envelope functions . as we shall see ( and has already been pointed out , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , smooth envelope functions are of particular interest because they allow high - efficiency scattering into a single order even in the quasi - bragg regime .",
    "the mathematical properties of the mathieu functions themselves have been explored by many workers .",
    "of relevance for this work is the power - series expansion of mathieu functions reported by kokkorakis and roumelotis @xcite .      in the experimental applications , it is often desirable to make the interaction time as short as compatible with certain requirements on the efficiency and parasitic phase shifts",
    "this can be achieved by operating in the quasi - bragg regime .",
    "for example , in atomic physics , long interaction times increase losses due to single - photon excitation and also systematic effects in atom interferometers . for fifth order bragg scattering of cesium atoms in a standing light wave ,",
    "satisfying the adiabaticity criterion requires interaction times @xmath7s , see sec .",
    "[ adiabaticbragg ] .",
    "this exceeds the time available in experiments under free - fall conditions , and would give rise to huge losses by single - photon excitation .",
    "moreover , the very sharp bragg condition in the pure bragg regime means that scattering happens only if the incident waves are within a very narrow of the velocity distribution of a thermal sample , which may mean that a large fraction will not be scattered at all .",
    "however , operation in the quasi - bragg regime requires a theoretical calculation of the losses and phase - shifts encountered , and strategies to minimize them .",
    "this is best done by analytic equations for these parameters , which allow one to easily see which parameters have to take which values .",
    "unfortunately , in this regime the population of the diffraction orders is particularly difficult to calculate @xcite and so the existing analytic theory of the quasi - bragg regime is restricted to square envelope functions or low orders , or both .",
    "moreover , even then , using the known formalisms it is hard to obtain power - series approximations of parameters like the effective rabi frequency in terms of the interaction strength .    the aim of this paper is to present an analytic theory of the quasi - bragg regime that allows the treatment of arbitrary scattering orders and envelope functions of the scattering potential .",
    "to do so , we develop a systematic way of obtaining more and more accurate solutions of the schrdinger equation that starts from the usual adiabatic approximation .",
    "this allows us to calculate the population of the diffraction orders , including losses to unwanted outputs and phase shifts .",
    "we can thus specify the minimum interaction time and the maximum interaction strength that yield losses which are below a given level , and consider the influence of the pulse shape .",
    "it will turn out that efficient scattering can be maintained with interaction times that substantially violate the adiabaticity criterion , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "for example , we show that fifth order scattering of cs atoms still has negligible losses and phase - shifts for interaction times on the order of 10@xmath8s if the pulse shape of the light is appropriately chosen .",
    "this minimum interaction time even decreases for higher scattering order .",
    "we will restrict attention to on - resonant bragg diffraction , neglecting any initial velocity spread that the atoms may have .",
    "this can certainly be a good assumption for experiments using bose - einstein condensed atoms , but also for a much wider class of experiments : the minimum interaction time that will still lead to low losses will turn out to be roughly given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the recoil frequency and @xmath11 the bragg diffraction order , see eq .",
    "( [ gaussianlimit2 ] ) .",
    "such short pulses have a fourier linewidth that is on the order of @xmath12 .",
    "this means that a velocity spread on the order of the recoil velocity can not be resolved , even though the velocity selectivity increases @xmath13 due to the multiple photons scattered .",
    "the preparation of atoms having a velocity spread of 1/100 - 1/10 of the recoil velocity is standard practice in atomic fountains .",
    "while our theory will be stated in the language of atomic physics , with an eye on applications in atom interferometry , it can be adapted to bragg diffraction in all fields of physics .",
