    "the second lightest bound nucleus in the @xmath11 isotonic chain is @xmath0be , placed in the nuclear chart just above the widely investigated borromean @xmath7li nucleus .",
    "these two nuclei are essential to understand the breakdown of the @xmath11 shell closure when the dripline is approached .",
    "the parity inversion in @xmath7be , already known in the early 70 s @xcite , is a clear indication of this fact .",
    "the particle unstable nucleus @xmath1li should in principle have the same neutron configuration as @xmath7be .",
    "several theoretical works also predicted the existence of an intruder low - lying @xmath12-wave state @xcite .",
    "the available experimental data concerning the ground state properties of @xmath1li are however controversial , although most of them point towards the existence of such low - lying virtual @xmath12-state @xcite .",
    "this result has been confirmed in the recent work @xcite .",
    "these properties of @xmath7be and @xmath1li clearly suggest that the @xmath13 shell gap is reduced when approaching the neutron dripline , leading to a structure of @xmath0be and @xmath7li with a large contribution from @xmath14 configurations .",
    "this has been confirmed theoretically and experimentally for both @xmath0be @xcite and @xmath7li @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7li properties have been successfully described by use of three - body models that freeze the degrees of freedom of the @xmath15li core @xcite .",
    "it is then tempting to follow a similar procedure to investigate @xmath0be .",
    "in fact , although @xmath0be is not borromean , @xmath7be is considered to be the prototype of one - neutron halo nuclei @xcite , and therefore a description of @xmath0be as a @xmath1be core surrounded by two neutrons appears as a good first approach .",
    "an important advantage of @xmath0be compared to @xmath7li is that the properties of @xmath7be are are much better known than the ones of @xmath1li , and therefore the uncertainties arising from the core - neutron interaction should in principle be smaller .",
    "however , while in @xmath7li the @xmath15li core is spherical , the @xmath1be core in @xmath0be is deformed , and as such one of the essential reasons for the shell closure breaking in @xmath0be .",
    "the ground state in @xmath7be contains an important contribution from core excited configurations @xcite .",
    "different theoretical calculations have estimated this contribution , and the results range from 40% in @xcite to 10% in @xcite , passing through 20% in @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite are consistent with a 16% admixture of core excitation in the @xmath7be ground state wave function .    as a consequence of this ,",
    "a description of @xmath0be as an inert core surrounded by two neutrons is quite questionable , and the role played by the core excitations is an important issue to be clarified . in @xcite",
    "a hyperspherical expansion of the three - body wave function was used to obtain the ground state of @xmath0be including core excitations .",
    "it was found that simultaneous fitting of the experimental ground state energy and the experimental longitudinal momentum distribution of @xmath1be after high energy fragmentation of @xmath0be , required a strong core excited component in the wave function ( @xmath16% ) .    however , after publication of this work additional experimental information about the spectrum of @xmath0be became available .",
    "a bound @xmath3 state and a bound @xmath4 state were found with excitation energies of 2.10 mev @xcite and 2.68 mev @xcite , respectively .",
    "also the existence of a second @xmath2 bound state with excitation energy of 2.24 mev was already envisaged @xcite ( later on confirmed @xcite ) .",
    "also , the ( @xmath0be,@xmath7be@xmath17 ) one neutron removal measurements at the nscl @xcite allowed a direct estimate of the @xmath18be@xmath19be(gs)@xmath20 spectroscopic factors .",
    "all this new data lead the authors of @xcite to review their calculations @xcite .",
    "they found that a reasonable simultaneous matching of the data required a significant reduction of the core deformation , and hence a smaller contribution from core excitation ( @xmath21% ) .",
    "very recently new experimental data on @xmath0be have been provided @xcite .",
    "specially interesting is the continuum relative energy spectrum for @xmath1be+@xmath22 after high energy breakup of @xmath0be on a carbon target .",
    "this invariant mass spectrum is known to be very sensitive to the final state interaction @xcite , and therefore , in our case , to the properties of the unbound @xmath7be states .",
    "a reliable calculation of the spectrum requires inclusion of the @xmath1be - neutron continuum states together with core - neutron resonances .",
    "this energy spectrum is then a very useful observable to investigate the role played by the @xmath1be - neutron interaction , and to constrain the remaining uncertainties in the structure of @xmath0be .    in previous @xmath0be three - body calculations ( @xmath1be+@xmath22+@xmath22 ) @xcite the wave functions were obtained using the hyperharmonic expansion .",
    "the employed neutron - core potentials were chosen to reproduce the bound @xmath7be states and perhaps the first resonance at 1.78 mev ( excitation energy ) but higher unbound states were ignored .",
    "this method is not the most efficient for a non - borromean system like @xmath0be , where two of the two - body subsystems have bound states .",
    "this is because an infinite hyperharmonic basis is in principle needed to reproduce the correct two - body asymptotics @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the hyperharmonic expansion is slow , and in practice the energies and rms radii are obtained after extrapolation of the numerical results @xcite where the basis is progressively increased up to a maximum value of the hypermomentum @xmath23 for the ground state , and @xmath24 for the excited states .    in the present context the hyperspheric adiabatic expansion method @xcite is more appropriate .",
    "this method solves the faddeev equations in coordinate space , treating symmetrically the three two - body interactions such that each of them only appears in its natural coordinates .",
    "this makes the method specially suitable for non - borromean systems like @xmath0be , where more than one two - body subsystem has bound states .",
    "also the method permits the use of much larger values of the hypermomentum quantum number which guaranties convergence of the results .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to assess to what extent a three - body model with an inert @xmath1be - core is able to reproduce the existing rather large amount of both old and new experimental data concerning @xmath0be , i.e. the @xmath0be spectrum , the @xmath25 and @xmath9 transition strengths @xcite , the @xmath26(e0 ) @xcite and the measured invariant mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the two - body potentials to be used in the calculations are fitted to reproduce the available two - body experimental data , in particular , the @xmath7be data . in this sense , although the @xmath1be core is considered an inert particle with spin and parity 0@xmath27 , the employed two - body interactions phenomenologically account for all effects of core excitation appearing in the corresponding channel . in particular",
    "it is interesting to know if the weakly bound excited states can be understood as halo states and perhaps can be better described in a three - body model than the relatively well bound ground state .",
    "relations between various quantities can be tested and new properties predicted . for this",
    "the hyperspheric adiabatic expansion method is well suited . by comparing computed results and available data",
    "we can establish how large the contributions must be from inclusion of core excitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we very briefly describe the basis of the three - body method .",
    "the different two - body interactions used in the calculations are detailed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the results are shown in sections [ sec4 ] , [ sec5 ] , and [ sec6 ] , where we discuss the spectrum and structure of @xmath0be , the electromagnetic transition strengths , and the invariant mass spectrum after high - energy breakup , respectively .",
    "we finish in section [ sec7 ] with a summary and the conclusions . in the appendix",
    "some remarks about the @xmath25 and @xmath9 operators are given .",
    "we assume @xmath0be can be described as a three - body system made by a @xmath1be core and two neutrons .",
    "the wave functions for the different bound states are obtained with the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "this method solves the faddeev equations in coordinate space .",
    "the wave functions are computed as a sum of three faddeev components @xmath28 ( @xmath29=1,2,3 ) , each of them expressed in one of the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates @xmath30 . each component",
    "is then expanded in terms of a complete set of angular functions @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the angles defining the directions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . writing the faddeev equations in terms of these coordinates , they can be separated into angular and radial parts : @xmath39 f_n(\\rho ) \\nonumber & & \\\\ & \\hspace*{-8 cm } + \\sum_{n ' } \\left ( -2 p_{n n ' } \\frac{d}{d\\rho } - q_{n n ' } \\right)f_{n'}(\\rho ) = 0 &   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the two - body interaction between particles @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the hyperangular operator @xcite and @xmath44 is the normalization mass . in eq.([eq3 ] ) @xmath45 is the three - body energy , and the coupling functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given for instance in @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath48 is used for fine tuning to take into account all those effects that go beyond the two - body interactions . in the present cases it is rather small and unless the opposite is explicitly said , this three - body potential is taken equal to zero .",
    "it is important to note that the angular functions used in the expansion ( [ eq1 ] ) are precisely the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the faddeev equations .",
    "each of them is in practice obtained by expansion in terms of the hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "obviously this infinite expansion has to be cut off at some point , maintaining only the contributing components .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath49 in eq.([eq2 ] ) enter in the radial equations ( [ eq3 ] ) as a basic ingredient in the effective radial potentials .",
    "accurate calculation of the @xmath50-eigenvalues requires , for each particular component , a sufficiently large number of hyperspherical harmonics . in other words",
    ", the maximum value of the hypermomentum ( @xmath51 ) for each component must be large enough to assure convergence of the @xmath50-functions in the region of @xmath52-values where the @xmath53 wave functions are not negligible .    finally , the last convergence to take into account is the one corresponding to the expansion in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "typically , for bound states , this expansion converges rather fast , and usually three or four adiabatic terms are already sufficient .",
    "it is known that for weakly bound systems , like for instance @xmath54he or @xmath7li , the short distance behaviour of the two - body potentials is relatively unimportant as long as they reproduce the low - energy scattering data .",
    "then the essential three - body properties can be described @xcite .      for the neutron - neutron interaction",
    "we use a simple potential reproducing the experimental @xmath12- and @xmath55-wave nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths and effective ranges .",
    "it contains central , spin - orbit ( @xmath56 ) , tensor ( @xmath57 ) and spin - spin ( @xmath58 ) interactions , and is explicitly given as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the relative orbital angular momentum between the two neutrons , and @xmath61 is the total spin .",
    "the strengths are in mev and the ranges in fm .",
    "we will refer to this potential as gaussian neutron - neutron potential .    to test the role played by the short - distance properties of the neutron - neutron interaction , for some specific cases",
    ", we are also using the more sophisticated @xmath62 version of the nucleon - nucleon argonne potential @xcite .",
    "this is a non - relativistic potential reproducing proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering data for energies from 0 to 350 mev , neutron - neutron low - energy scattering data , as well as the deuteron properties .      for the neutron - core interaction",
    "we have constructed an @xmath63-dependent potential of the form : @xmath64 where @xmath60 is the neutron - core relative orbital angular momentum and @xmath65 is the spin of the neutron .",
    ".strengths ( in mev ) and ranges ( in fm ) of the central and spin - orbit gaussian potentials ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) entering in eq.([eq5 ] ) for the four interactions used in the calculations . for @xmath68-waves the radial potentials are made as the sum of two gaussians , whose strengths and ranges are given by the corresponding two rows in the table . in potential @xmath69 the acronym  p.e.p \"",

    "one of the tools for studying the structure of three - body halo nuclei was breakup reactions on a target . by relatively fast removal of one of the constituents the remaining two",
    "are essentially left undisturbed and measurements of their momenta then provide fairly direct information about the initial state .",
    "we use this technique to investigate the two - body substructures of @xmath0be . the experimental relative @xmath1be - neutron energy spectrum ( or invariant mass spectrum ) after @xmath0be breakup on a carbon target at a beam energy of 39.3 mev / nucleon is shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "both fragments , @xmath1be and neutron , are simultaneously detected , and their relative decay energy is reconstructed from the measured momenta .",
    "the final @xmath1be - neutron states are then restricted to unbound states in @xmath7be .",
    "this spectrum can easily be computed by use of the sudden approximation .",
    "we assume that the target transfers a ( relatively large ) momentum to one of the particles ( one of the neutrons ) in the projectile which then is instantaneously removed .",
    "the remaining two particles , the @xmath1be - core and the second neutron , are just spectators in the reaction , meaning that they continue their motion undisturbed without further interaction with the removed particle .",
    "they do , however , continue to interact with each other .    under this assumption",
    "the differential cross section of the process takes the form : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the three - body wave function with total angular momentum @xmath72 and projection @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the momenta associated to the jacobi coordinates @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the coupled spin of the spectator two - body system and the spin of the removed particle , respectively , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the corresponding spin projections . finally , @xmath82 is the continuum two - body wave function of the spectators ( @xmath1be and neutron ) in the final state .",
    "this two - body wave function is computed with the corresponding two - body interaction and the boundary condition at small distance determined to be precisely the @xmath1be - neutron structure left by removing the other neutron in @xmath0be , see @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "after integration of eq.([eq9 ] ) over @xmath75 and the angles describing the direction of @xmath74 we obtain the differential cross section @xmath83 , which is related to the invariant mass spectrum as shown in @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the core energy and mass , @xmath87 and @xmath88 the neutron energy and mass , @xmath89 the relative neutron - core energy , and @xmath44 is the normalization mass used to define the jacobi coordinates .",
    "the presence in eq.([eq9 ] ) of the two - body wave function @xmath90 makes it evident that the invariant mass spectrum ( [ eq10 ] ) crucially depends on the final state two - body interaction .",
    "it is important to note that eq.([eq9 ] ) is not assuming that the two spectators populate two - body resonances in the final state .",
    "the two - body wave function @xmath82 contributes for any value of the relative two - body momentum @xmath74 , not only for those where @xmath74 matches a two - body resonance energy . except for those very precise values of @xmath74",
    ", @xmath82 is just an ordinary continuum two - body wave function .    in fig.[figinv1 ] we show the relative core - neutron energy spectrum after removal of one neutron from @xmath0be on a light target according to eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "the results for the different @xmath1be - neutron interactions used in this work are shown .",
    "the computed curves have been scaled to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "also , the experimental energy resolution has been taken into account by convoluting the computed distributions with a gaussian having a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to @xmath91 ( @xmath45 in mev ) @xcite .",
    "as a general result , all the potentials reproduce equally well the peak at about 1.2 mev , and the tail of the distribution . in the same way",
    "all of them underestimate the spectrum in the region around 2.2 mev and do not reproduce the very narrow peak at very low energies .",
    "potential @xmath69 ( dot - dashed curve ) is reproducing the peak at 1.2 mev best of all , but on the other hand gives a worse agreement with the experiment in the region between 3 and 4 mev .",
    "compared to the results with potential @xmath92 ( solid curve ) , inclusion of the argonne nucleon - nucleon potential ( dotted curve ) slightly improves the behaviour at small energies but also slightly spoils the agreement with the experiment at large energies .    in fig.[figinv2 ]",
    "we show , for different @xmath1be - neutron potentials , the contribution from @xmath12- , @xmath55- , and @xmath68- waves to the total invariant mass spectrum . here",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath55 , and @xmath68 refer to the value of the @xmath1be - neutron relative orbital angular momentum . in the figure",
    "the dotted and dot - dashed curves give the contribution from the @xmath93 and @xmath94-waves , respectively .",
    "we notice that the main peak in the distribution is produced by the @xmath94-wave .",
    "this can be traced back to the @xmath95 resonance in @xmath7be at 1.28 mev above threshold .",
    "the 3/2@xmath27 resonance , with an energy of 2.90 mev , helps to match the experimental tail of the distribution .",
    "the @xmath12- and @xmath55-waves contribute mainly at small energies , and they are almost entirely responsible for the distribution below 1 mev .    from fig.[figinv2",
    "] it is now easy to understand that the main disagreement between the computed curves and the experimental data is due to the absence in the calculation of the 3/2@xmath96 resonance in @xmath7be , whose energy above threshold is 2.19 mev , precisely the energy region where the disagreement is found . however , as already mentioned , inclusion of this resonance necessarily requires information beyond the present @xmath0be three - body model with an inert @xmath1be core . if we still insist on the picture of a three - body system with a @xmath1be core , then a 3/2@xmath96 state in @xmath7be needs either a neutron in the @xmath55-shell coupled to the 2@xmath27 state of @xmath1be , or a neutron in the @xmath14-shell coupled to @xmath1be in a negative parity state .",
    "another possibility is of course to use a different cluster description for @xmath0be , like for instance @xmath15be in the 3/2@xmath96 ground state plus three neutrons .",
    "therefore , except for the lack of this state in the @xmath7be spectrum , the contributions obtained in this work for the 0@xmath27 ground state are consistent with the experimental invariant mass spectrum given in @xcite .    the highest @xmath7be resonance that has been considered in our calculations is the @xmath97 state at 2.90 mev .",
    "the next excited states in @xmath7be are the @xmath98 and @xmath10 resonances with energies above threshold at 3.49 mev and 3.46 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "for the same reason as the @xmath10 state at 2.19 mev , these two states can not be included in our three - body picture with an inert @xmath1be core . in any case , decay of these two resonances into the ground state of @xmath1be plus a neutron would give some small contribution to the tail of the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "however , these two states can also decay into @xmath1be plus a neutron but leaving @xmath1be in its @xmath3 excited state at 3.37 mev .",
    "therefore very little energy is left for the neutron after such decay ( less than 100 kev @xcite ) , giving rise to the experimental sharp peak at very low energies .",
    "theoretical calculation of this peak requires then also inclusion of core excitations in the model .    in @xcite the experimental fwhm of the @xmath1be longitudinal momentum distribution after fragmentation of @xmath0be on a carbon target ( beam energy equal to 56.8 mev / nucleon )",
    "is found to be @xmath99 mev@xmath100 . within the sudden approximation",
    ", such distribution can also be computed from eq.([eq9 ] ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "the widths of the longitudinal core momentum distributions are computed to be 162 mev@xmath100 , 159 mev@xmath100 , 169 mev@xmath100 , 171 mev@xmath100 , and 166 mev@xmath100 for the neutron - core potentials @xmath92 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath69 , and @xmath92+@xmath62 , respectively .",
    "inclusion of core excitations should help to reduce the discrepancy between the computed widths and the experimental value .",
    "the components having spin of the core equal to 2 , and coupling to the total angular momentum zero of the @xmath0be ground state , must necessarily contain non - zero values for @xmath103 or / and @xmath104 .",
    "this means additional centrifugal barriers which attempt to confine the three - body system to smaller spatial extension , and subsequently producing broader momentum distributions .",
    "the properties of @xmath0be have been investigated assuming a three - body structure with an inert @xmath1be core and two neutrons .",
    "a description of the nucleus by use of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method is particularly appropriate in this case , since two of the two - body subsystems have bound states .",
    "the symmetric treatment of all the two - body interactions makes it easier to reproduce the correct two - body asymptotics",
    ". this could be especially important for the weakly bound excited states .",
    "we constructed four different neutron-@xmath1be interactions , each of them reproducing the known spectrum of @xmath7be up to an excitation energy of 3.41mev .",
    "however , the 3/2@xmath96 resonance in @xmath7be has been excluded , since it requires the @xmath1be core to be in an excited state .",
    "this case goes beyond the three - body model with an inert core that is used in this work .",
    "nevertheless , part of the effects arising from core deformation are effectively taken into account through the fitting procedure of the neutron-@xmath1be potential . for the neutron - neutron interaction two different potentials",
    "have been used , both reproducing low - energy scattering data .",
    "we have found two @xmath2 , one @xmath3 , one @xmath4 and one @xmath5 bound states .",
    "the first four are known experimentally , but not the @xmath5 state .",
    "the computed binding energies agree reasonably well with the experimental value for the ground @xmath2 state and the excited @xmath4 state . for the second @xmath2 and",
    "the @xmath3 states a larger discrepancy is found , which can be attributed to contributions from core excitations additional to the ones masked in the neutron-@xmath1be potential . to reproduce the experimental two - neutron separation energies for these states we included a three - body force .",
    "the dominating components of the wave functions correspond to the ones expected from the extreme single particle model .",
    "the ratio of the computed neutron - neutron and core - neutron root mean square distances increases with the excitation energy .",
    "all possible electric and magnetic transition strengths have also been computed . an effective charge for the neutron",
    "is used to take into account distortion or polarization of the core .",
    "this effective charge has been obtained by adjusting the calculation to reproduce the experimental @xmath105 transition strength in @xmath7be , as well as its charge root mean square radius .",
    "core excitations can contribute to transition strengths in two different ways .",
    "there could be a direct contribution arriving from the transition between two core states or a contribution to the wave function of a @xmath0be state then leading to an indirect effect on transition strengths .",
    "the direct contribution of core excitations in the @xmath0be monopole and dipole strength functions should be negligible , since @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 operators can not couple the @xmath72=0 and @xmath72=2 states .",
    "on the other hand , quadrupole transition operators can couple these states and there could be an important effect from the excitation of the core .",
    "the possible contribution of core excitations to wave functions of @xmath3 and @xmath109 states could lead to some uncertainties in the calculated transition strengths involving those states .",
    "our calculations reproduce rather well the available experimental data .    the relative @xmath1be - neutron energy spectrum after @xmath0be breakup on a carbon target at a beam energy of 39.3",
    "mev / nucleon has been computed within the sudden approximation .",
    "for all the potentials the experimental spectrum is rather well reproduced . only in the region around 2.2 mev",
    "the computed curves underestimate the experiment .",
    "this is due to the absence of the 3/2@xmath96 resonance in our @xmath7be spectrum , which originates from @xmath1be - core excited states .    in summary ,",
    "a frozen - core three - body model is able to reproduce most of the properties of @xmath0be : ground and excited bound states , electromagnetic transition strengths , and invariant mass spectrum after high - energy breakup .",
    "core excitations , however , are needed to improve the two - neutron separation energies for the @xmath110 and @xmath3 states , to get a better estimate of the quadrupole transition strengths and monopole transition matrix element , and to fine tune the agreement with the experimental invariant mass spectrum .",
