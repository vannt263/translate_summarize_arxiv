    "variational inequalities in probability , ergodic theory and harmonic analysis have been the subject of many recent research papers . one important character of these inequalities is the fact that they can be used to measure the speed of convergence for the family of operators in consideration . to be more precise ,",
    "consider , for instance , a measure space @xmath17 and an operator @xmath2 on @xmath18 .",
    "form the ergodic averages of @xmath2 : @xmath19 a fundamental theorem in ergodic theory states that if @xmath2 is a contraction on @xmath20 for every @xmath21 , then the limit @xmath22 exists a.e .",
    "for every @xmath9 .",
    "one can naturally ask what is the speed of convergence of this limit .",
    "a classical tool for measuring that speed is the following square function @xmath23 the problem being to estimate its norm @xmath24 .",
    "this issue goes back to stein @xcite , who proved that if @xmath2 as above is positive on @xmath25 ( in the hilbertian sense ) , then a square function inequality @xmath26 holds for any @xmath1 .",
    "stein s inequality is closely related to dunford - schwartz s maximal ergodic inequality , @xmath27 this maximal inequality and its weak type @xmath28 substitute for @xmath29 are key ingredients in the proof of the previous pointwise ergodic theorem .",
    "the strong @xmath8-variation is another ( better ) tool to measure the speed of @xmath22 .",
    "bourgain was the first to consider variational inequalities in ergodic theory .",
    "to state his inequality we need to recall the definition of the strong @xmath8-variation . given a sequence @xmath30 of complex numbers and a number @xmath31 , the strong @xmath8-variation norm is defined as @xmath32 where the supremum runs over all increasing sequences @xmath33 of integers such that @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that the set @xmath7 of all sequences with a finite strong @xmath8-variation is a banach space for the norm @xmath35 .",
    "bourgain @xcite proved that if @xmath2 is induced by a measure preserving transformation on @xmath17 , then for any @xmath36 , @xmath37 this inequality was then extended to @xmath20 for any @xmath1 by jones , kaufman , rosenblatt and wierdl @xcite .",
    "the latter paper contains many other interesting results on the subject .",
    "note that the predecessor of bourgain s inequality is lpingle s variational inequality for martingales @xcite .",
    "the latter says that if @xmath38 is an increasing sequence of conditional expectations on a probability space @xmath39 , then we have an estimate @xmath40 ( see also @xcite for further results on that theme ) .    since @xcite",
    ", variational type inequalities have been extensively studied in ergodic theory and harmonic analysis .",
    "many classical sequences of operators and semigroups have been proved to satisfy strong variational bounds , see in particular @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to exhibit a large class of operators @xmath2 on @xmath20 for a fixed @xmath1 with the following property : for any @xmath6 , there exists a constant @xmath41 ( which may depend on @xmath8 and @xmath2 ) such that for any @xmath9 , the sequence @xmath42 belongs to @xmath43 , and @xmath44 we show that this holds true provided that @xmath2 is a positive contraction ( more generally , a contractively regular operator ) and @xmath2 is analytic , in the sense that @xmath45    inequality implies , of course , a similar variational inequality for the ergodic averages @xmath46 .",
    "however , in this latter case , the analytic assumption above can be removed .",
    "namely , for a positive contraction @xmath2 on @xmath20 with @xmath1 we have an estimate @xmath47 for any @xmath6 .",
    "this result extends those of @xcite and @xcite quoted previously .    note that inequality for positive analytic contractions considerably improves our previous maximal ergodic inequality for such operators @xmath2 proved in @xcite . in this sense , this paper is a continuation of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our proof of heavily relies on the square function inequality of @xcite .",
    "we also establish results similar to ( [ 1q1 ] ) and ( [ 1q3 ] ) for strongly continuous semigroups .",
    "this requires the following continuous analog of @xmath7 .",
    "given a complex family @xmath48 , define @xmath49 where the supremum runs over all increasing sequences @xmath50 of positive real numbers .",
    "then we let @xmath51 be the resulting banach space of all @xmath48 such that @xmath52 .",
    "consider a bounded analytic semigroup @xmath15 on @xmath20 , with @xmath1 . we show that if @xmath53 is a positive contraction ( more generally , a contractively regular operator ) for any @xmath54 , then for any @xmath6 and any @xmath9 , the family @xmath55(\\lambda)\\bigr)_{t>0}$ ] belongs to @xmath51 for almost every @xmath56 , and we have an estimate @xmath57(\\lambda)\\bigr)_{t>0}\\bigr\\vert}_{v^q}\\bigr\\vert}_p \\,\\leq\\,c\\,{\\vertx\\vert}_p,\\qquad x\\in l^p(\\omega).\\ ] ]    we mention that jones and reinhold @xcite proved ( [ 1q2 ] ) for positive , unital symmetric diffusion semigroups and ( [ 1q1 ] ) for a certain class of convolution operators ( only in the case @xmath58 ) .",
    "our results turn out to extend these contributions in various directions .    as in the discrete case ,",
    "we obtain similar results for the averages of the semigroup if we remove the analyticity assumption .",
    "inequalities for ergodic averages , such as ( [ 1q3 ] ) , will be established in section 3 . then our main results leading to ( [ 1q1 ] ) and ( [ 1q2 ] ) will be established in section 4 , using the above mentioned results from section 3 , as well as square function estimates from @xcite .",
    "section 5 is devoted to various complements . on the one hand ,",
    "we establish individual (= pointwise ) ergodic theorems in our context .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is a positive analytic contraction , then @xmath59 exists a.e . for every @xmath9 . on the other hand , it is well - known that ( [ 1q3 ] ) can not be extended to the case @xmath60 .",
    "then we show analogs of ( [ 1q3 ] ) and ( [ 1q1 ] ) when @xmath7 is replaced by the oscillation space @xmath61 .",
    "we give examples and applications in section 6 .",
