    "the secondaries of w uma contact binaries have an unusual mass - luminosity relationship which was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that it is caused by the energy transfer from the primary ( the more massive component ) to the secondary ( the less massive component ) within a convective envelope .",
    "but the mechanism causing energy transfer between the two components of w uma contact binaries and the effect of the energy transfer on the components are not clear .",
    "w uma contact binaries are an important class of eclipsing variables in several respects . in studies of galactic structure ,",
    "w uma contact binaries play an important role because they have high spatial frequency of occurrence , ease of detection , and provide a standard candle for distance determinations @xcite .",
    "more importantly , w uma contact binaries are interesting objects due to the mass and energy transfer between two components .",
    "understanding the energy and mass transfer in the common envelope is necessary to develop a correct theory of the structure and evolution of w uma systems .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the mechanism causing energy transfer is a core problem for understanding the structure and evolution of w uma contact binaries @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer in w uma systems has been investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the relative energy transfer rate of w uma contact binaries using the normal mass - luminosity relation for independent stars and found that the relative energy transfer rate depends only on the mass ratio of w uma contact binaries .",
    "@xcite found that the relative energy transfer rate increases with increasing mass ratio continuously based on 22 contact binaries .",
    "@xcite found that the energy transfer rate depends not only on the mass ratio but also on the evolutionary degree of the primary . by studying a catalogue data of 159 systems",
    ", @xcite found that the energy transfer rate is a function of the mass and luminosity ratio .",
    "the treatment of the energy transfer is very important to construct theoretical models of w uma contact binaries .",
    "although it seems probable that the energy transfer occurs in the common envelope of w uma systems , it is not clear at present where and how the transfer is taking placed in the common envelope . the structure and evolution of w uma contact binaries have been investigated by several authors in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is found that loss of contact is avoided if the energy transfer is assumed to be sufficiently effective @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the region of energy transfer in the common envelope of w uma contact binaries , and showed that the energy transfer may take place in the radiative region of the common envelope .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mechanism of the energy transfer may be differential rotation which has been observed by helioseismology in the solar convection zone @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary in w uma contact binaries will restructure the secondary and make it oversized and overluminous for its mass @xcite .",
    "the radii of the secondaries of w uma contact binaries ( including a- and w - types ) are obviously altered from those of zero - age main sequence ( zams ) stars @xcite .",

    "2007    @xcite defined a relative energy transfer rate which is the ratio of the transferred luminosity to the surface luminosity of the primary .    * based on the assumption that the primaries are zams , the relative energy transfer rate @xmath1 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the surface luminosity of the primary and the secondary ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are their nuclear luminosities , respectively @xcite .",
    "we can give another relative energy transfer rate as @xmath17 using equation ( 1 ) , we have @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20,@xmath21 , @xmath0 is mass ratio and @xmath22 is the exponent of mass - luminosity relation and it is equal to 3.42 .",
    "if it is assumed that the components in each w uma system are identical in the effective temperature , and that the components of each w uma contact binary just fill the inner roche lobes ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , equation ( 4 ) and equation ( 5 ) can be written as @xmath24 @xmath25 the theoretical curves and the observational data are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 with a solid line and the open stars ( w - subtypes ) or the solid squares ( a - subtypes ) , respectively .",
    "it is seen in figure 2 and figure 3 that although the theoretical curves can reflect the distribution of the @xmath1 @xmath3 @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath0 of the observed data , the observational points are largely scattered and some observed systems are significantly deviated from the solid line .",
    "the deviation might be caused by the applicability of the basic assumptions .",
    "*    in order to find the applicability of the basic assumptions , we take @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath22 to be different values . at first , we must inspect the applicability of a basic assumption that the components of each w uma system just fill their inner roche lobes ( i.e. @xmath23 ) .",
    "in fact , most observed systems are over - contact binaries , and they should not satisfy this relation . the relation between the logarithms of the radius ratio ( @xmath28 ) and the logarithms of the mass ratio @xmath0 of the observed systems is shown in figure 4 . as seen from figure 4 ,",
    "the logarithm of the radius ratio is almost linearly changed with the logarithms of the mass ratio .",
    "a least - squares solution leads to the following relation , @xmath29 according to equation ( 8) , @xmath30 , which is indeed different from roche approximation relation @xmath31 .",
    "these relations are also plotted in figure 4 with a dashed line and a solid line , respectively . using the relation , @xmath30 , of the observed systems , equation ( 4 ) and equation ( 5 )",
    "are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 with a dot - dashed line , respectively .",
    "as seen from figure 2 and figure 3 , the dot - dashed lines are very similar to the solid ones .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the components of each w uma systems just fill their inner roche lobes is acceptable .",
    "secondly , the different values of @xmath22 are adopted by the different investigators ( 4.0 , @xcite , 4.6 , @xcite ) . if @xmath32 ( the largest value ) , the relative distributions between the observed systems and the theoretical curves are similar to those shown by figures 2 and 3 , although the observed points and theoretical curves have been shifted since they are shifted with the same direction .",
    "this suggests that the exponent of the mass - luminosity relation has little effects on the relative distribution between the observed systems and the theoretical curves .",
    "so , the assumption that the components in w uma systems are zams is also acceptable .",
    "finally , we inspect the assumption of the two components with equal temperature in each w uma system .",
    "the distribution of @xmath27 for the observed w uma systems is located in a region from 0.88 to 1.097 .",
    "we take @xmath27 to be 0.9 and 1.1 .",
    "we plot the resulting curves in figure 2 and figure 3 with two dashed lines . as seen from figure 2 and figure 3",
    ", these two dashed lines can cover the large scattering of the observed systems .",
    "therefore , the deviation caused by unequal effective temperatures of the components of w uma systems are larger than those caused by other two assumptions .",
    "this suggests that the equal - temperature assumption for the components of w uma systems is the most unreasonable one in three basic simplifying assumptions .",
    "the temperature difference is also an important parameter for investigating the classification and the energy transfer of w uma contact binaries .",
    "it is defined by @xcite as @xmath33 the temperatures of w uma binary components can differ substantially , and this difference was explained by different proportions of the energy exchange in superadiabatic and adiabatic part of envelopes @xcite . @xcite investigated the relations between the temperature difference and other observational parameters , and found that the temperature difference for w - type systems is not correlated with the mass ratio , the fill - out parameter or the color .    the relation between the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath1 ) and the temperature difference is shown in figure 5 .",
    "w uma contact binaries seem to populate a strip limited by two solid lines , and there is a tendency for decreasing temperature difference with increasing relative energy transfer rate .",
    "this suggests that the temperature difference is correlated with the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this also indicates that the temperature of the secondary increases with increasing relative energy transfer rate and even exceeds the temperature of the primary if the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath1 ) is large enough , and that a thermal coupling exists in the two components of w uma contact binaries .",
    "main - sequence stars with @xmath34 have little or no convective envelope ; however , main - sequence stars with @xmath35 have a convective envelope and a radiative core @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that convection is by no means essential to heat transport in the common envelope of w uma systems by employing eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "this means that the temperature difference should not depend on the mass of the primary .",
    "the distribution of the temperature difference @xmath36 @xmath3 the primary s mass @xmath5 is shown in figure 6 . as seen from figure 6 ,",
    "the distribution of temperature difference of the observed systems with @xmath37 is similar to that of the systems with @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that there is no correlation between the temperature difference and the mass of the primary , and that the efficiency of energy transfer in the common envelope of w uma systems is indeed not significantly enhanced by convective motion .",
    "the mass - radius relations of the secondaries for a- and w - type of w uma contact binaries are different from that of zams stars @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary @xcite .",
    "but the relation between the energy transfer and the radius of the secondary is not clear .",
    "the relation between the relative radius change of the secondary * ( @xmath39 ) * and the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath2 ) of w uma contact binaries is plotted in figure 7 .",
    "@xmath40 is the radius of the main sequence secondary in w uma systems without the effect of the energy transfer , i.e. it is the radius of * zams with * mass @xmath6 . according to @xcite ,",
    "it can be expressed as    @xmath41    where @xmath6 is the mass of the secondary in solar units . as seen in figure 7 ,",
    "the relative radius change of the secondary is correlated with the relative energy transfer rate @xmath2 , i.e. * the radius of the secondary in a w uma system increases with increasing @xmath2*. this indicates that the energy transfer exercises a decisive influence on the secondaries of a - type and w - types . by using a linear fitting ,",
    "the relation between the relative radius change of the secondary ( @xmath42 ) and the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath2 ) can be written as    @xmath43    this correlation is a result of the response of the secondary to the energy transfer from the primary .",
    "it is the energy transfer that makes the radii of the secondaries of w uma contact binaries deviate from those of zams stars @xcite .",
    "however , a w uma system vw cep has a radius smaller than that given by equation ( 10 ) .",
    "vw cep is one of triple systems @xcite .",
    "so the smaller secondary of vw cep might be attributed to an inaccurate spectroscopic solution due to the presence of the additional companion .",
    "@xcite argued that the over - luminosity of the secondary is related to its density .",
    "this is also due to the effect of the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary on the density of the secondary .",
    "the relation between the relative density change of the secondary * ( @xmath44 ) * and the relative energy transfer rate ( @xmath2 ) is presented in figure 8 . as shown from figure 8 , the relative density change increases with increasing relative energy transfer rate .",
    "this suggests that the more the secondary gets energy from the primary , the lower the density of the secondary becomes .",
    "a secondary obtaining more energy from the primary would swell more greatly , and then its density would become smaller .",
    "in this paper , we investigate * the energy transfer * of w uma contact binaries based on a sample of 133 w uma contact binaries , and then we study the effects of the energy transfer on the secondaries of w uma systems .    * based on the assumptions(the components are contact configurations with nearly uniform effective temperature and the primaries are zams ) , the relations are given between the relative energy transfer rates and the mass ratio of w uma systems .",
    "the theoretical curves can reflect the distribution of @xmath1 @xmath3 @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath0 .",
    "but some observation systems are significantly deviated from these curves . by comparing the observational data and these resulting curves",
    ", it is found that the deviations are mainly resulted from the difference in the effective temperatures of the components in w uma systems .",
    "this means that the assumption that the components are uniform in effective temperature should be restrainedly applied to investigate the energy transfer in w uma systems . *    the distribution of the temperature difference @xmath3 the mass of the primary suggests that the convection does not affect the efficient of energy transfer between two components in the common envelope of w uma contact binaries .",
    "this suggests that the energy transfer in w uma systems does not depend on the property of the common envelope of w uma contact binaries and the convection is by no means essential to heat transport in the common envelope of w uma systems .",
    "this also suggests that the energy transfer might occur in radiative region of common envelope of w uma contact binaries @xcite or the mechanism of energy transfer might be the differential rotation @xcite or circulation currents ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ".    the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary would lead w uma systems to be not in thermal equilibrium , then lead w uma contact binaries to suffer thermal relaxation oscillations ( tro ) .",
    "however , the energy transfer is also related to the evolutionary degree of the primary , i.e. the higher is the evolutionary degree of the primary , the lower is the energy transfer rate @xcite .",
    "this suggests that with the evolution of w uma systems , the thermal relaxation oscillation might be disappeared if the evolutionary degree of the primary is high enough .",
    "if the energy transfer rate decreases in the evolved w uma systems , the rate of mass transferred from the secondary to the primary should become smaller and smaller with the evolution of w uma systems , and the decrease in mass ratio of the systems would become slower and slower , so that the lifetime of w uma systems might become longer than the prediction of the theory models @xcite .",
    "figure 7 shows that the relative radius change of the secondary increases with increasing relative energy transfer rate @xmath2 . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the the deviation of the radius of the secondary from that of zams stars is probably the result of the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary in w uma contact binaries .",
    "the energy transfer from the primary to the secondary is more than the energy generated in the core of the secondary , so the radius and density of the secondaries is significantly influenced by the energy transfer and their radius and density deviates from those of zams stars .",
    "@xcite calculated the effects of energy transfer on the radius and temperature of stars and gave the response functions for the radius and temperature of the stars . in present paper , we have given a relation between the relative radius change of the secondary and the relative energy transfer rate @xmath2 .",
    "this relation probably provides a useful information in the structure of the secondaries in w uma contact binaries , and can help us to understand the structure and evolution of w uma systems .",
    "the authors are grateful to an anonymous referee for his / her valuable suggestions and insightful remarks , which have improved this paper greatly .",
