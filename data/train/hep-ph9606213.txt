    "the phenomenology of radiative non  leptonic kaon decays provides crucial tests for the ability of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6 ) @xcite to explain weak low ",
    "energy processes and interesting possibilities to study cp violation in these channels .",
    "@xmath6 is a natural framework that embodies together an effective theory ( satisfying the basic chiral symmetry of qcd ) and a perturbative feynman  dyson expansion .",
    "its success in the study of radiative non  leptonic kaon decays has been remarkable ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "of course there are still open problems , but upcoming experiments should improve our phenomenological knowledge of these decays , in particular on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is a very interesting channel by itself as a @xmath6 test and also in order to establish the relative role of the cp conserving contribution to @xmath12 versus the cp violating contributions @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 has no @xmath13 tree level contribution since the external particles are neutral .",
    "for this same reason there are no @xmath14 counterterms and the chiral meson loops are finite at this order @xcite .",
    "consequently @xmath6 gives an unambiguous prediction .",
    "furthermore only an helicity suppressed amplitude for @xmath15 is generated , which is small compared to the cp violating ones . at higher orders in @xmath6",
    "a new invariant amplitude , generating an unsuppressed helicity amplitude to @xmath15 , appears . as we will see in detail",
    "later there is a specific kinematical region in the diphoton invariant mass spectra of the @xmath16 processes where only this last amplitude contributes .",
    "this is the region where both photons are nearly collinear , i.e. at small diphoton invariant mass .",
    "the experimental results showed @xcite that while the @xmath14 predicted spectrum looked in good agreement with the experiment , finding no contribution at small diphoton invariant mass , the predicted branching ratio was underestimated by a factor slightly bigger than two , two sigmas away from the experimental result .",
    "this fact prompted to several authors to consider higher chiral order corrections : i ) vector meson exchange contributions to the local @xmath17 amplitude @xcite , ii ) unitarity corrections from @xmath18 @xcite and iii ) complete unitarization of the @xmath19 intermediate states through a khuri - treiman treatment and inclusion of the experimental @xmath20 amplitude @xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that these higher order corrections do not represent a complete chiral order contribution .",
    "the size of the first correction is controversial @xcite , however a large contribution by itself is excluded by the experimental spectrum .",
    "the second contribution shows that unitarity corrections of @xmath21 to @xmath11 increase @xmath22 the leading order amplitude and then have to be taken into account @xcite . when both contributions are added it was possible to fit both the width and the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the third correction increases the branching ratio by an additional @xmath23 .",
    "the charged channel @xmath2 is experimentally less known ( only an upper limit on the branching ratio exists @xcite ) , but measurements with good precision are foreseen in the near future @xcite . the leading one  loop @xmath14 result has been computed @xcite and depends upon unknown weak local amplitudes which however could give important informations on vector meson weak interactions . indeed while at @xmath14 it is well known that the finite part of the counterterms in the strong @xmath6 lagrangian is saturated by the spectrum of lightest resonances ( vector , axial ",
    "vector , scalar and pseudoscalar ) @xcite , the situation in the @xmath14 weak lagrangian is less clear due to our ignorance on the weak couplings of vector mesons , however there are predictive models to test @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath1 unitarity contribution to @xmath2 with the same procedure used to compute the @xmath24 unitarity corrections to @xmath11 @xcite . the dispersive contribution is unambiguously computed up to a polynomial piece which is reabsorbed ( together with the loop divergences ) in the counterterms .",
    "moreover various vector dominance exchange models are studied to saturate the bulk of the counterterms as in @xmath11 .",
    "then we can give a definite prediction for the kinematical region of nearly collinear photons where the unknown contribution of the @xmath14 local amplitude is negligible .",
    "the experimental study of @xmath2 in the da@xmath5ne @xmath5factory @xcite and other experiments @xcite is going to improve the phenomenology of @xmath7 and will allow us to analyze both channels in a correlated way .",

    "the antisymmetric character of the @xmath40 amplitude under the interchange of @xmath38 and @xmath39 means effectively that while its leading contribution is @xmath0 this only can come from a finite loop calculation because the leading counterterms for the @xmath44 amplitude are @xmath48 .",
    "however also this loop contribution is helicity suppressed compared to the @xmath42 term . as shown in a similar situation in the electric direct emission of @xmath49 @xcite , this antisymmetric @xmath0 loop contribution might be smaller than the local @xmath48 contribution .",

    "at @xmath0 there are only four independent lorentz invariant local amplitudes contributing to @xmath2  : @xmath74 where the last one has no analogous in @xmath75 . in general the couplings of these operators",
    "are not directly related with the ones in @xmath11 due to the fact that the electric charge matrix does not conmute with the generators of the electrically charged field .",
    "as we shall see , in specific models , relations between the two channels can be found .",
    "all of these operators contribute to @xmath35 but only the first one in ( [ eq : kind ] ) gives a @xmath36 amplitude .",
    "loop divergences at @xmath0 are absorbed in the counterterm coefficients , that thus renormalized are finite .",
    "chiral dimensional analysis @xcite tells us that their contributions are suppressed compared to @xmath14 by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "nevertheless vector meson exchange was found to enhance this up to @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus we try to estimate the contributions of the lightest resonances , i.e. vector mesons , and we assume that heavier resonances and non  resonant contributions give smaller corrections .",
    "this picture seems well verified in the strong coupling constants at @xmath14 @xcite , and it is likely to apply to the weak couplings .",
    "we are going to consider here the contribution of vector meson resonances to the weak @xmath0 counterterms for @xmath2 ( a more complete discussion and an extension to @xmath11 is given in @xcite ) and we find that only the terms in ( [ eq : kind ] ) with derivatives on the meson fields can be generated by vector meson exchange .    following the study of @xmath11 in @xcite",
    "we assume that the contribution to the local amplitudes for @xmath2 is dominated by vector meson resonances and define their contribution with an adimensional parameter @xmath78 generated by the first term in ( [ eq : kind ] ) as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the vector resonance contribution to the @xmath42 amplitude .",
    "the @xmath41 amplitude generated by vector exchange @xmath81 gets contributions from the first and second structure in ( [ eq : kind ] ) .",

    "photon ( @xmath84 ) vertex and a strong one ( @xmath85 ) . while the first can be computed in a model independent way ,",
    "the generation of direct @xmath84 weak vertices is still poorly known and therefore only models can be used .",
    "the _ external _ weak transition for @xmath2 gives @xmath86 where @xmath87 and the strong @xmath84 coupling @xmath88 is defined by @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is an element of the coset space @xmath92 parameterized in terms of the goldstone fields @xmath93 @xmath94 , @xmath95 are the strength field tensors associated to the external @xmath96 and @xmath97 fields , @xmath98 is the nonet of vector meson resonances , @xmath99 is the decay constant of pion and , finally , @xmath100 . in our case with two photon external fields @xmath101   .",
    "the model dependent contribution to @xmath78 from _ direct _ weak vertices in the wdm and fm quoted above is  : @xmath102 where in the fm @xmath103 is the unknown fudge factor that is not fixed by the model and satisfies @xmath104 .",
    "naive factorization predicts @xmath105  .    by adding ( [ eq : avext ] ) and ( [ eq : avdir ] ) we see that @xmath106 is @xmath107 we note that for the allowed range of values of @xmath103 in the fm both models agree in predicting a very small vector meson contribution to @xmath0 in @xmath2 and therefore the important conclusion of our exercise is that the vector contribution to the local @xmath36 amplitude can be neglected .",
    "if , as it is reasonable to assume , other resonance interchange corrections are even smaller , we can conclude that the small @xmath32 region of @xmath2 is completely predictable at @xmath0 through chiral loops and it is likely to be dominated by the unitarity corrections of @xmath1 to @xmath2 . indeed in that region",
    "the @xmath0 is dominant and our ignorance on the @xmath108 amplitude is irrelevant .",
    "the amplitude for the process @xmath110 can be expanded in powers of the dalitz plot variables @xmath111 where @xmath112 for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the subscript @xmath115 indicates the odd pion . for the decay",
    "@xmath116 the isospin decomposition , neglecting the small phase shifts and up to quadratic terms , is written as @xcite @xmath117 where the subscripts @xmath118 and @xmath115 refer to @xmath119 transitions respectively , and the coefficients in ( [ eq : ay2x2 ] ) have been fitted to the data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 amplitude @xmath120 with the value of @xmath52 in ( [ eq : g8fer ] ) underestimates by 20 - 30% the experimental linear slopes for @xmath1 . at the next chiral order ,",

    "is generated by ( [ eq : ap2k ] ) , it seems natural to try to include all the contributions to @xmath2 generated by the experimental slopes in ( [ eq : ay2x2 ] ) , i.e. we evaluate the @xmath0 contributions to @xmath2 induced by the @xmath14 corrections to @xmath1 .",
    "this can be done similarly to the case of @xmath11 in @xcite : ( [ eq : ay2x2 ] ) is considered as an effective @xmath121 chiral vertex , the kinematical variables are replaced by the appropriate covariant derivatives , the qed scalar vertices are added through minimal coupling and then the usual feynman diagrams approach can be used .",
    "there are 13 feynman diagrams that have two different topologies .",
    "there is a subset of 9 diagrams where one or both photons are radiated by the external legs and therefore do not give and absorptive contribution .",
    "the sum of these bremsstrahlung  like diagrams is not gauge invariant and cancels with an analogous term from the 4 remaining diagrams ( two of which have also an absorptive part ) and generate the @xmath35 and @xmath36 amplitudes .",
    "this loop result for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 amplitudes is divergent and needs to be regularized and renormalized .",
    "we have used dimensional regularization and divergences are absorbed by the four counterterms discussed earlier .",
    "alternatively one could use a subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "while the absorptive contribution is uniquely determined , the dispersive one , due to the presence of subtraction constants , can be computed only up to a polynomial .",
    "this is precisely the same ambiguity that happens in the effective vertex method that we have used where the finite part of the counterterms is a priori unknown .",
    "we assume that the dominant contribution should come from the non  polynomial amplitude generated by the cut of the two  pion intermediate state .",
    "otherwise contributions generated by a vanishing on ",
