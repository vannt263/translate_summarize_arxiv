    "the mesh must fit well to the physical conditions like e. g. symmetry of the problem .",

    "thus the _ outer _ nodes are distributed on the edges of layers . in the center of each layer and also in the middle between two layers are located inner nodes .",
    "they are connected with _",
    "outer _ nodes creating in this way the main figure s construction .",
    "initial mesh elements obtained in such a manner are of tetrahedral shape .",
    "the boundary of the figure is defined by set of _ surface _",
    "equations for vertical and horizontal segment lines linking _ outer _ nodes . after each mesh iteration",
    "new nodes are created and labeled as _ outer _ or _",
    "ones according to surface equations .",
    "moreover , the location of each node ( i. e. on which exactly vertical , horizontal line or surface patch the node is lying ) is also stored .",
    "new elements are created by a division of already existing elements . at the beginning of the routine",
    ", the surface of division mainly connects a new node born on the longest element edge with two other nodes belonging to that mesh element and one node from the divided edge .",
    "the procedure constitutes a 3d extension of the 2d mesh generation routine described already in @xcite .",
    "however , during the routine a number of small elements is increasing , and the division of the longest bar is not anymore the optimal way of proceeding .",
    "that is why , before choosing an edge to the division volume of elements common to it is checked .",
    "the edge that will not produce new elements having its volume smaller than an assumed * critical volume * is chosen to be cut .",
    "the optimization is done with help of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the system energy is calculated as a sum of discrepancies between an element volume @xmath63 and assumed element volume @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes a prescribed length of the edge @xmath127 thus the smaller a degeneracy from a designed volume distribution the more optimal state .",
    "the metropolis routine starts from a nodal configuration given by described above procedure .",
    "the main point is to reach the optimal global configuration by ascertaining local optimal states .",
    "they arise from such a configuration of @xmath3-th node and its neighboring nodes which gives smaller energy @xmath128 .",
