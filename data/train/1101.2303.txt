    "the control of light signal with the magnetic state or conversely the light sensing of the magnetic state is a key issue in the contemporary information technology , as realized in many magneto - optical devices and elements .",

    "some exceptions are found for the materials endowed with inherent strong charge - spin coupling and magnetically controllable competing orders , such as spin - crossover complexes @xcite , colossal - magnetoresistive oxides @xcite , and low - dimensional molecular magnets @xcite . even for these materials",
    ", however , a high magnetic field of several tesla is necessary to cause the gigantic magnetochromism .    a more promising candidate to host the gigantic magnetochromism is the multiferroic compound , where the electricity and magnetism is inherently coupled @xcite .",
    "such a coupling is recently evidenced for a variety of oxide compounds , as typified by the magnetic field control of ferroelectricity in tbmno@xmath9 @xcite and by the electric field control of the magnetization in gdfeo@xmath9 @xcite . as a consequence of such a strong magnetoelectric response , a number of multiferroics may have the potential to show the magnetic resonance in the dielectric constant @xmath10 spectrum , in addition to ( or rather than ) the magnetic permeability spectrum .",
