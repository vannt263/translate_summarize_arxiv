    "the quark distributions in the proton and neutron are parametrized as parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) obtained from global fits to various sets of data at very high energies .",
    "these fits are done within the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in either leading order ( lo ) or next to leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the most important data come from deep - inelastic e/@xmath3 scattering experiments on hydrogen and deuterium , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 experiments on nuclear targets . in previous publications  @xcite",
    "we have compared the predictions of the nlo mrsr2 pdfs to deep - inelastic e/@xmath3 scattering data  @xcite on hydrogen and deuterium from slac , bcdms and nmc . in order to get agreement with the lower energy slac data for @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 down to @xmath8=1 gev@xmath9 , and at the highest values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , we found that the following modifications to the nlo mrsr2 pdfs must be included .    1 .",
    "the relative normalizations between the various data sets and the bcdms systematic error shift must be included  @xcite .",
    "deuteron binding corrections need to be applied and the ratio of @xmath12 at high @xmath10 must be increased as discussed in ref",

    "3 .   kinematic higher - twist originating from target mass effects  @xcite are very large and must be included .",
    "4 .   dynamical higher - twist corrections are smaller but also need to be included  @xcite .",
    "5 .   in addition , our analysis including qcd next to nlo ( nnlo ) terms shows  @xcite that most of the dynamical higher - twist corrections needed to fit the data within a nlo qcd analysis originate from the @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : nnlofig ] shows that the nlo mrsr2 pdfs with target mass and nnlo higher order terms describe electron and muon scattering @xmath6 and @xmath7 data with a very small contribution from higher twists .",
    "studies by other authors  @xcite also show that in nnlo analyses the dynamic higher twist corrections are very small .",
    "if ( for @xmath18 1 gev@xmath9 ) most of the higher - twist terms needed to obtain agreement with the low energy data actually originate from target mass effects and missing nnlo terms ( i.e. not from interactions with spectator quarks ) then these terms should be the same in @xmath4 and e/@xmath3 scattering . therefore , low energy @xmath4 data should be described by the pdfs which are fit to high energy data and are modified to include target mass and higher - twist corrections that fit low energy e/@xmath3 scattering data . however , for @xmath19 1 gev@xmath9 additional non - perturbative effects from spectator quarks must also be included  @xcite . in a previous communication  @xcite",
    "we used a modified scaling variable @xmath2 and fit for modifications to the grv94 leading order pdfs such that the pdfs describe both high energy low energy e/@xmath3 data . in order to describe low energy data down to the photoproduction limit ( @xmath20 ) , and account for both target mass and higher twist effects ,",
    "the following modifications of the grv94 lo pdfs are need :    1 .   we increased the @xmath12 ratio at high @xmath10 as described in our previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "2 .   instead of the scaling variable @xmath10 we used the scaling variable @xmath21 ( or = @xmath22 ) .",
    "this modification was used in early fits to slac data  @xcite .",
    "the parameter a provides for an approximate way to include @xmath23 target mass and higher twist effects at high @xmath10 , and the parameter b allows the fit to be used all the way down to the photoproduction limit ( @xmath8=0 ) .",
    "3 .   in addition",
    "as was done in earlier non - qcd based fits  @xcite to low energy data , we multiplied all pdfs by a factor @xmath24=@xmath8 / ( @xmath8 + c ) .",
    "this was done in order for the fits to describe low @xmath1 data in the photoproduction limit , where @xmath25 is related to the photoproduction cross section according to @xmath26 4 .",
    "finally , we froze the evolution of the grv94 pdfs at a value of @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) , because grv94 pdfs are only valid down to @xmath29 gev@xmath9 .    in our analyses ,",
    "the measured structure functions were corrected for the bcdms systematic error shift and for the relative normalizations between the slac , bcdms and nmc data  @xcite .",
    "the deuterium data were corrected for nuclear binding effects  @xcite .",
    "a simultaneous fit to both proton and deuteron slac , nmc and bcdms data ( with @xmath30 only ) yields a=1.735 , b=0.624 and c=0.188 ( gev@xmath9 ) with grv94 lo pdfs ( @xmath31 1351/958 dof ) .",
    "note that for @xmath2 the parameter a accounts for @xmath23 target mass and higher twist effects .",
    "in this publication we use a new improved scaling variable @xmath0 and fit for modifications to more modern grv98 lo pdfs such that the pdfs describe both high energy and low energy electron / muon data .",
    "we now also include nmc and h1 94 data at lower @xmath10 . here",
    "we freeze the evolution of the grv98 pdfs at a value of @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) , because grv98 pdfs are only valid down to @xmath33 gev@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we use different photoproduction limit multiplicative factors for valence and sea .",
    "our proposed new scaling variable is based on the following derivation . using energy momentum conservation",
    ", it can be shown that the factional momentum @xmath35 = @xmath36 carried by a quark of 4-mometum @xmath37 in a proton target of mass m and 4-momentum p is given by @xmath35 = @xmath38^{1/2})]$ ] , where    @xmath39+[(q^2+m_f{^2}-m_i{^2})^2   + 4q^2(m_i{^2}+p_{t}^{2})]^{1/2}.$ ]    here @xmath40 is the initial quark mass with average initial transverse momentum @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the mass of the quark in the final state . the above expression for @xmath35",
    "was previously derived  @xcite for the case of @xmath43 .",
    "assuming @xmath44 we use instead :    @xmath45^{1/2})+ax)$ ]    here @xmath42=0 , except for charm - production processes in neutrino scattering for which @xmath42=1.5 gev . for @xmath0",
    "the parameter a is expected to be much smaller than for @xmath2 since now it only accounts for the higher order ( dynamic higher twist ) qcd terms in the form of an @xmath46 target mass term ( the effects of the proton target mass are already taken into account using the exact form in the denominator of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the parameter b accounts for the initial state quark transverse momentum and final state quark @xmath47 @xmath48 ( originating from multi - gluon emission by quarks ) .    using closure considerations  @xcite ( @xmath49the gottfried sum rule ) it can be shown that , at low @xmath1 , the scaling prediction for the @xmath50 quark part of @xmath6 should be multiplied by the factor @xmath24=[1-@xmath51(@xmath8)][1+m(@xmath8 ) ] where @xmath32 = 1/(1+@xmath8/0.71)@xmath52 is the electric proton elastic form factor , and m(@xmath53 is related to the magnetic elastic form factors of the proton and neutron . at low @xmath1 , [ 1-@xmath51(@xmath8 ) ] is approximately @xmath8/(@xmath8 + c ) with @xmath54 ( versus our fit value c=0.18 with grv94 ) . in order to satisfy the adler sum rule",
    "@xcite we add the function m(@xmath8 ) to account for terms from the magnetic and axial elastic form factors of the nucleon ) .",
    "therefore , we try a more general form @xmath55=[1-@xmath51(@xmath8)][@xmath8+@xmath56/[@xmath8 + @xmath57 , and @xmath58=@xmath8/(@xmath8+@xmath59 ) . using this form with the grv98 pdfs ( and now also including the very low @xmath10 nmc and h1 94 data in the fit ) we find @xmath60=0.419 , @xmath61=0.223 , and @xmath62=0.544 , @xmath63=0.431 , and @xmath59=0.380 ( all in gev@xmath9 , @xmath31 1264/1200 dof ) .",
    "as expected , a and b are now smaller with respect to our previous fits with grv94 and @xmath2 . with these modifications ,",
    "the grv98 pdfs must also be multiplied by @xmath64=1.011 to @xmath65 to the slac @xmath66 data .",
    "the fit ( figure [ fig : f2fit ] ) yields the following normalizations relative to the slac @xmath66 data ( @xmath67=0.986 , @xmath68=0.964 , @xmath69=0.984 , @xmath70=1.00 , @xmath71=0.993 , @xmath72=0.977 , and bcdms systematic error shift of 1.7 ) .",
    "comparisons of @xmath73 using these modified grv98 pdfs to other data which were @xmath74 @xmath75 in the fit is shown in figure [ fig : predict ] . from duality",
    "@xcite considerations , with the @xmath0 scaling variable , the modified grv98 pdfs should also provide a reasonable description of the average value of @xmath6 in the resonance region .",
    "figure [ fig : predict](a ) shows a comparison between resonance data ( from slac and jefferson lab , or parametrizations of these data  @xcite ) and the predictions with the standard grv98 pdfs ( lo ) and with our modified grv98 pdfs ( lo+ht ) .",
    "the modified grvb98 pdfs are in good agreement with slac and jlab resonance data down to @xmath76 ( although resonance data were not included in our fits ) .",
    "there is also very good agreement of the @xmath73 of our modified grv98 in the @xmath77 limit with photoproduction data as shown in figure [ fig : predict](b ) .",
    "we also compare the @xmath73 with our modified grv98 pdfs ( lo+ht ) to a few representative high energy ccfr @xmath4 and @xmath5 charged - current differential cross sections  @xcite on iron ( neutrino data were not included in our fit ) . in this comparison we use the pdfs to obtain @xmath25 and @xmath78 and correct for nuclear effects in iron  @xcite . the structure function @xmath79 is obtained by using the @xmath80 fit from reference  @xcite .",
    "there is very good agreement of our @xmath73 with these neutrino data on iron .    in order to have a full description of all charged current @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes",
    ", the contribution from quasielastic scattering  @xcite must be added separately at @xmath81 .",
    "the best prescription is to use our model in the region above the first resonance ( above @xmath82=1.35 gev ) and add the contributions from quasielastic and first resonance  @xcite ( @xmath82=1.23 gev ) separately .",
    "this is because the @xmath83 and @xmath82=1.23 gev regions are dominated by one and two isospin states , and the amplitudes for neutrino versus electron scattering are related via clebsch - gordon rules  @xcite instead of quark charges ( also the v and a couplings are not equal at low @xmath82 and @xmath1 ) . in the region of higher mass resonances ( e.g. @xmath82=1.7 gev )",
    "there is a significant contribution from the deep - inelastic continuum which is not well modeled by the existing fits  @xcite to neutrino resonance data ( and using our modified pdfs should be better ) . for nuclear targets , nuclear corrections  @xcite must also be applied .",
    "recent results from jlab indicate that the fe / d ratio in the resonance region is the same as the fe / d ratio from dis data for the same value of @xmath35 ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "the effects of terms proportional to the muon mass and @xmath84 and @xmath85 structure functions in neutrino scattering are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the future",
    ", we plan to investigate the effects of including the initial state quark @xmath41 in @xmath0 , and institute further improvements such as allowing for different higher twist parameters for u , d , s , c , b quarks in the sea , and the small difference ( expected in the adler sum rule ) in the @xmath24 factors for axial and vector terms in neutrino scattering .",
    "in addition , we can multiply the pdfs by a modulating function  @xcite a(w,@xmath8 ) to improve modeling in the resonance region ( for hydrogen ) by including ( instead of @xmath86 ) the resonance data  @xcite in the fit .",
    "we can also include resonance data on deuterium  @xcite and heavier nuclear targets in the fit , and low energy neutrino data .",
    "note that because of the effects of experimental resolution and fermi motion  @xcite ( for nuclear targets ) , a description of the average cross section in the resonance region is sufficient for most neutrino experiments .",
