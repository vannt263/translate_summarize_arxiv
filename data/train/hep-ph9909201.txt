    "there are three mass regions in which in which there are recent experimental indications for states at masses inconsistent with potential model predictions :    * crystal barrel , ves , argus and l3 @xcite have evidence for @xmath4 approximately 170 mev lower than potential model expectations @xcite .",
    "* delphi , but _ not _ cleo and opal , observes a new resonance @xmath5 with a total width of less than 15 mev @xcite .",
    "the observed mass uniquely identifies the state as a radially excited @xmath6 if mass predictions from potential models are used @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation has been found to be inconsistent with the narrow width @xcite .",
    "assuming that the delphi result is confirmed , this may signal a crisis for potential models .",

    "zou @xcite , typically at appreciably lower masses than found by potential models @xcite .    at least some of these discrepancies with potential models should be related to the appearance of new degrees of freedom in the qcd spectrum : hybrid mesons and glueballs .",
    "a careful lattice qcd calculation has been performed to map out the energy of a @xmath8 pair , with the quarks stationary , as a function of the distance @xmath9 between them , called the _",
    "adiabatic surface _",
    "( see figure 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the lowest surface corresponds to conventional mesons , but the excited surfaces to various hybrid mesons .",
    "the interpretations of this result are consistent between various authors . at small",
    "@xmath9 , the adiabatic bag model where quarks are stationary @xcite , or a glue  lump model where quarks are fixed at the centre of a bag @xcite , gives a reasonable description of the lattice data . at large @xmath9 , a constituent gluon model ( related to the bag model )",
    "is not applicable @xcite , but a nambu  goto string picture instead @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the string behaviour only sets on at @xmath9 beyond that relevant for most of hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "experimental isovector @xmath10 exotic mesons have been reported at @xmath11 gev in @xmath12 by e852 and crystal barrel , and at @xmath13 gev in @xmath14 and @xmath15 by e852 and ves @xcite .",
    "an experimental search is currently underway at jefferson lab : for the @xmath12 and @xmath16 channels the spin formalism for analysis is identical to that of a vector meson @xcite , which differs from the exotic by its c  parity .",
    "the lowest state at @xmath11 gev appears rather low in comparison to lattice qcd estimates for the lowest @xmath17 state , which can be a hybrid or four  quark state . in the last year",
    "these are @xmath18 gev @xcite and @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "the latter result incorporates some effects of unquenching , increasing the error bar .",
    "one has to remember that the lattice qcd predictions correspond to a strange quark , so that the light quark states should have even lower mass , taking experimental conventional meson masses as a guide . for a more comprehensive discussion of lattice qcd results ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we shall now discuss three interpretations of the exotic states .",
    "i. the @xmath20 gev state is a ground state hybrid , and the @xmath21 gev state an excited hybrid .",
    "this hypothesis is catastrophic @xcite .",
    "the low mass of the @xmath20 gev state is a problem .",
    "the fact that the low mass state has only been seen in @xmath12 is qualitatively in contradiction with symmetrization selection rules that suppress the decay of @xmath17 hybrids to @xmath12 @xcite . within the flux ",
    "tube model , the mass difference between the states is too small , the total width of the @xmath20 gev state too small and the ratio of widths of the two states opposite to experiment @xcite .",
    "the 1.4 gev state is a four  quark state ( _ or _ molecule ) and the 1.6 gev state a ground state hybrid .",
    "first the 1.4 gev state .",
    "the low mass is still a problem .",
    "it s observed decay to @xmath12 is consistent with the symmetrization selection rules @xcite , and with a four  quark su(3 ) selection rule that predicts @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a possible problem here is that no stable @xmath10 four  quark state has been found in a quark model search @xcite .",
    "for the 1.6 gev state , its non  detection in @xmath12 is consistent with the symmetrization selection rules @xcite , and @xmath23 with the hybrid su(3 ) selection rule @xcite .",
    "moreover , the decay to @xmath24 is also according to expectations @xcite .",
    "the 1.4 gev `` state '' is produced by the interference of a non  resonant deck background peaking near 1.4 gev with a hybrid meson resonance at 1.6 gev .",
    "a k  matrix fit to the e852 event and phase data in @xmath12 using this hypothesis in shown in figure 2 @xcite .",
    "a key feature is that the phase motion in the e852 @xmath12 data at 1.4 gev can arise from a @xmath21 gev resonance which does not couple strongly to @xmath12 , through coupled channel effects .",
    "the deck process involves @xmath25 inelastic scattering into @xmath26 via @xmath27 exchange .",
    "deck processes are however only operative in @xmath25 experiments ( e852 and ves ) , and not in @xmath28 annihilation at crystal barrel .",
    "hence this explanation does not explain all the data .",
    "the mechanism of strong decay of hybrids to two mesons via pair creation is of significant interest , since it may be different from that of conventional mesons due to the structure of the glue .",
    "the first possibility is that hybrids decay similar to the phenomenologically successful way for mesons : @xmath29 pair creation by flux ",
    "tube breaking @xcite .",
    "a second possibility , found in the heavy quark limit of qcd in coulomb gauge , is @xmath30 pair creation by flux ",
    "tube breaking arising from the hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath31    these two pictures lead to characteristic differences between the d to s  wave width ratios of @xmath32 : the ratios are much smaller in the @xmath30 than in the @xmath29 model @xcite .",
    "one may soon be able to test these ratios with new data from e852 and ves .",
    "the current status of light vector hybrids was discussed @xcite .",
    "also , there were various new qcd sum rule results .",
    "the first calculation of the width of a 1.6 gev exotic to @xmath33 yielded @xmath34 @xmath35 mev @xcite .",
    "exotic @xmath36 and @xmath37 light hybrid masses were also investigated @xcite . also , heavy ",
    "light hybrid masses @xcite and decays @xcite were studied .",
    "the high precision and almost complete glueball spectrum below @xmath38 gev in figure 1 was calculated in lattice qcd @xcite . in order to connect this spectrum with experiment , mixing with and decay to conventional mesons",
    "need to be understood .",
    "a first attempt at understanding the decay of the primitive ( bare ) scalar glueball to pseudoscalar mesons was made some time ago in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "an unusual decay pattern was found , where the coupling of the glueball to @xmath39 was greater than its coupling to @xmath40 , and the latter greater than its coupling to @xmath41 .",
    "historically the expectation based on perturbative qcd was a `` flavour democratic '' decay pattern where each of these couplings are the same @xcite . the first successful model to explain",
    "the lattice qcd decay pattern postulates that the glueball does not decay directly , but only via an intermediate scalar meson , which then subsequently decays to the two pseudoscalars via the familiar @xmath29 pair creation mechanism @xcite . a perfect one ",
    "parameter fit to the three lattice points is obtained .",
    "it has paradoxically been found that perturbative qcd decay of glueballs with bag model gluon wave functions can also fit the lattice points @xcite , although the indirect decay through intermediate mesons is still present .",
    "the problem here is that perturbative qcd is not applicable for the scalar glueball @xcite .",
    "the physical glueball does not necessarily decay flavour democratically or is narrow .",
    "this is already experimentally evident for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it has also recently been found in an analysis of the tensor glueball @xcite , making a narrow flavour democratically decaying @xmath44 implausible .",
    "the only hope for finding narrow glueballs appears to be when they are unmixed with mesons .",
    "this is a possibility for glueballs beyond 3 gev , since light mesons in this mass region may become unstable due to qcd pair creation , and charmonium have limited mixing @xcite .",
    "for example , a `` glue  rich '' quark  gluon plasma can produce a narrow vector glueball which decays to readily detected @xmath45 .",
    "another tantilizing possibility is production of high  mass glueballs from the proposed gsi darmstadt upgrade .",
    "the caveat is that even pure glueballs may not be narrow , as lattice qcd finds a scalar glueball width of @xmath46 mev to pseudoscalars only , while models suggest that additional modes may increase the width to at least @xmath47 mev @xcite .",
    "interesting new results were obtained in the large number of colours @xmath1 limit of qcd .",
    "teper noticed it to be an excellent guide to glueball masses even for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "one can argue that the glueball mass follows the relation      so that corrections from the large @xmath1 limit are of second order @xcite .",
    "simulations of the scalar and tensor glueball masses in su(2 ) , su(3 ) and su(4 ) are indicated in table 1 .",
    "the agreement between @xmath50 is striking .",
    "the salient feature is that @xmath53 is the would ",
    "be dominant mode , but that the @xmath3 hybrid mass straddles its threshold . removing the narrow resonance approximation",
    "is expected to increase the width to @xmath53 .",
    "we obtain a surprisingly narrow state , whose simplest search channel is @xmath54 .",
    "a natural place to search for @xmath3 hybrids is at jefferson lab , where the photon has a sizable coupling to @xmath3 .",
    "production may be complicated , as diffractive exchange is forbidden by c  parity conservation , and meson exchange involves ozi forbidden or evading processes .              c.j .",
