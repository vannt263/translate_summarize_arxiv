    "the study of kerr optical frequency comb generation has been the focus of extensive research efforts in recent years .",
    "these spectral grids are obtained through pumping a ultra - high @xmath0 whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) resonator with a narrow - linewidth continuous ( cw ) laser .",
    "almost all previous research have been devoted to the investigation of kerr comb generation in the anomalous group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) regime .",
    "in fact , it was thought for a long time that normal gvd kerr comb generation was impossible , and later on , it has been shown to occur only under fairly exceptional circumstances ( see for example refs .",
    "this explain why the quasi - totality of the scientific literature on kerr combs assumes a laser pump frequency in the anomalous gvd regime for the bulk material of the resonator .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the difficulty to generate kerr combs in the normal gvd regime was the purpose of the first part of this research work , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the dispersion is anomalous , earlier studies on kerr comb generation have shown that above a given threshold , the long - lifetime photons originating from the pump interact nonlinearly with the medium and populate the neighboring cavity modes through four - wave mixing ( fwm ) .",
    "the resulting permanent state features an all - to - all coupling amongst the excited modes , which can enable various dynamical outputs such as phase - locked ( through turing patterns or solitons ) , pulsating and even chaotic states .",
    "in particular , the phase - locked states are expected to be useful for a wide spectrum of applications  @xcite .",
    "synthetic studies where all these behaviors are associated to well identified regions of the parameter space are scarce .",
    "most research articles so far have focused on specific phenomenologies ( modulational instability , solitons , chaos , breathers , etc . ) and our objective in this paper is to provide a larger viewpoint for the understanding of kerr comb generation with anomalous gvd .",
    "the models used so far to investigate kerr comb generation are either based on a modal expansion approach  @xcite or on a spatiotemporal formalism  @xcite which is a variant of the lugiato - lefever equation ( lle )  @xcite .",
    "both approaches can be shown to be equivalent under certain conditions  @xcite , but the latter appears to be more powerful to investigate the collective dynamics of a large number of modes .",

    "it is well known that chaos can potentially arise in any nonlinear system with at least three degrees of freedom .",
    "the lle is indeed a highly nonlinear and infinite - dimensional system , and in fact , the phenomenology of interest ( kerr comb generation ) for us essentially relies on the nonlinearity .    from a practical viewpoint , almost all high - dimensional and nonlinear systems display chaos when they are strongly excited . chaos in kerr combs",
    "has been unambiguously spotted both theoretically and experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the lyapunov exponent had been computed and shown to be positive under certain circumstances .",
    "another study on this topic is ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the preceding sections , at least two routes to chaos can be identified in this system .",
    "the first route corresponds to unstable turing patterns . in figs .",
    "[ chaos](a ) and  ( b ) shows that in that case , the kerr comb is made of very strong spectral lines corresponding to the primary comb , and apparent spectral lines standing in between , and which are the signature to what was referred to as the secondary comb in refs .",
    "hence , in this case , the route to chaos as the pump power @xmath73 is increased is a sequence of bifurcations starting with the primary comb which becomes unstable and leads to the emergence of a secondary comb ; later on , higher - order combs are sequentially generated until a fully developed chaotic state is reached , as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ chaos](c ) and  ( d ) .    the second route to chaos corresponds to unstable solitons . here , as the pump power",
    "is increased , the solitons become unstable and the system enters into a `` turbulent '' regime characterized by the pseudo - random emergence of sharp and powerful peaks , as it can be seen in figs .  [ chaos](e ) .",
    "this kind of chaos is very likely give birth in the wgm resonator to the extreme events referred to as _ rogue waves_.",
    "the bifurcation map displayed in fig .",
    "[ figurebifnotatscale ] in the @xmath79@xmath184 plane disregards the effect of the magnitude of the dispersion .",
    "indeed , the effect induced by the value of @xmath185 depends on the localized or non - localized nature of solution under study .    more precisely , if we consider both super- and sub - critical turing patterns ( non - localized structures ) the effect of decreasing @xmath185 is straightforward as it increases the number of rolls according to eq .",
    "( [ def_l_mgm ] ) just above the pump",
    ". however , as the pump is increased beyond the bifurcation , such a decrease of @xmath185 also reduces the pulse - width of the individual turing rolls in the sub - critical case . as far as solitons are concerned ( localized structures ) , the effect of reducing @xmath185 is essentially to decrease the pulse width of the solitons .",
    "sub - critical turing patterns and solitons have the same behavior in this regards , and this is a direct consequence of the fact that they are intimately connected from a topological point of view .",
    "it should be noted once again that reducing the magnitude of second order gvd to arbitrarily small values can increases the relevance of higher - order dispersion terms in the lugiato - lefever model  @xcite .",
    "a general consequence of a decrease in @xmath185 is that as the patterns have a narrower pulse - width , and as we commented in part  i  @xcite , this will generally allow for the excitation of a large number of solitons in the cavity .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding kerr comb spectra will also display a higher complexity .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the bifurcation structure of the lugiato - lefever equation which is used to model kerr comb generation using wgm resonators .",
    "we have focused on the case of anomalous dispersion and our analysis has evidenced a plethora of possible steady states .",
    "turing patterns arise in the system through a @xmath20 bifurcation , and they can be characterized by their super- or sub - critical nature .",
    "the threshold for these patterns can be analytically determined , as well as the number of rolls .",
    "we have also been able to determine analytically the parametric gain allowing modulational instability .",
    "we have also shown how the super- or sub - critical nature of the patterns affect their temporal dynamics and the way they can be excited .",
    "our investigations have also enabled to analyze the formation of solitons .",
    "we have shown that more complex structures , referred to a soliton molecules , can be generated as well in the system , and can eventually coexist along the azimuthal direction of the resonator .",
    "breather solitons have been analyzed as well , and we have also investigated the emergence of chaos in the system . the complexity of the related kerr combs has also been studied and discussed",
    ". future work will be devoted to the investigation of the effect of higher - order nonlinearity and dispersion  @xcite , and to the tailoring of the spectral characteristics of the combs for various technological applications  @xcite .",
