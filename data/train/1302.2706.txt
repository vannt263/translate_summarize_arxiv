    "the indications for a preferred direction in diverse data sets have motivated many theoretical studies of inflationary models which violate statistical isotropy and homogeneity , giving rise to a direction dependent power spectrum @xcite .",

    "an anisotropic bianchi model is expected to become isotropic within a time scale of order @xmath4 during the early stages of inflation @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite , that even this brief early phase of anisotropic expansion can lead to violations of statistical isotropy in the current era .",
    "it was shown that for a wide range of parameters , modes generated during the anisotropic inflationary period can re - enter the horizon at recent times and hence affect observations .",
    "for some parameter range they may re - enter even before decoupling of radiation from matter @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we shall show that the anisotropic modes arising during the very early phase of inflation can consistently explain the alignment of cmb quadrupole and octopole .",
    "we point out that our explanation is within the framework of the inflationary big bang cosmology .",

    "we define a new statistic , which tests the overall correlation of the power tensor between two adjacent modes .",
    "the theoretical estimate of this statistic is fitted to the observed data for @xmath1 modes .",
    "we find that models i and iii provide a better description of data since they capture the important feature that the anisotropy decays rapidly for large @xmath0 .",
    "we also find that perturbation theory is qualitatively reliable in models i and ii .",
    "the contribution due to higher order terms in model i is likely to introduce a correction of about 25% . in model iii , the best fit to the eigenvalue dispersion for @xmath1 modes",
    "is driven to relatively large values of the anisotropy parameter , making perturbation theory unreliable . in any case",
    "this might not be the best method to fix the model parameters since the dispersion observed in data is not statistically significant for these modes .",
    "hence it may be better to fix the parameters of both models ii and iii by making a global fit to the cmbr temperature and polarization data .",
    "it may also be useful to perform a non - perturbative analysis of the anisotropic metrics .",
    "the observed data has shown several signals which indicate a preferred direction , pointing roughly towards the virgo supercluster .",
    "the fact that several diverse data sets , including radio , cmbr and optical , lead to the same preferred direction gives us some confidence that the observed anisotropy arises due to a physical effect .",
    "we have related these observations to an early anisotropic phase of inflation .",
    "it would clearly be of interest to test our models further by studying their implications for higher multipoles , cmbr polarization , radio and optical polarizations and the large scale structure of universe .",
