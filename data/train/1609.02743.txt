    "in the last decades a great effort has been devoted to the study of nonlinear systems of partial differential equations of implicit type . given an open bounded subset @xmath5 , let @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the prototype problem can be written as @xmath9 or equivalently as the differential inclusion @xmath10 where @xmath11 different and quite general methods have been developed to prove the existence of almost everywhere @xmath12 solutions to under suitable mild regularity assumptions on the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the scalar case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath15 , we can for instance rely on the viscosity method , initiated by crandall and p .- l .",
    "lions @xcite , the pyramidal construction by cellina @xcite , on the baire category method introduced by cellina in @xcite and later developed by dacorogna and marcellini in @xcite ( see also the monograph @xcite and the references therein ) and also on the gromov integration approach developed by mller and sverak in @xcite .",
    "the last two approaches are suitable to be applied also in the vectorial setting , i.e. for @xmath16 .",
    "the pyramidal construction , the baire category method and the gromov integration approach are not constructive and usually , when they can be applied , provide the existence of infinitely many solutions .",
    "thus the question of selecting a preferred solution among them raised .    to underline the difficulties one can encounter , we first discuss the scalar case , @xmath15 .",
    "a natural idea would be to use the theory of viscosity solutions .",
    "this would serve as a perfect selection principle , providing uniqueness as well as explicit formulas for the solution . nevertheless its applicability is limited .",
    "indeed , the existence of a viscosity solution can be proved only under quite strict compatibility conditions between the geometry of @xmath1 and the set @xmath17 ( cfr . @xcite and @xcite for a complete analysis ) .",
    "a more general approach has been proposed by cellina in @xcite . under the hypothesis that the boundary datum @xmath14 is affine",
    ", his construction gives an explicit solution to ( [ general differential inclusion ] ) in a special domain related to the functions @xmath13 .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath18 , if @xmath19 can be written as a convex combination of a finite number of matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , belonging to @xmath17 , then the _ pyramid _ defined by @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is a @xmath26 solution of in the domain @xmath27 observe that the pyramid is an affine piecewise function whose gradient takes only a finite number of values , @xmath28 .",
    "moreover for any @xmath29 the set @xmath30 is connected . using as building blocks the rescaled pyramids , it is then possible to construct a solution ( and actually infinitely many ) of in a general domain @xmath1 by a vitali covering .",
    "it is worth observing that , unless @xmath1 has a very special geometry , imposing the boundary condition forces the solutions to have a fractal behavior near the boundary .",
    "an explicit vitali covering made up of sets where a viscosity solution exists has been proposed in @xcite .    in the recent literature , inspired by the cellina s construction",
    ", some selection criteria have been proposed to somehow minimize the irregularities of the solutions , and taking into account their fractal behavior .",
    "most of the results are restricted to the the case where @xmath17 is a finite set . in this framework , in @xcite and @xcite , the attention has been focused on the system of eikonal equations in dimension @xmath31 : @xmath32 since a viscosity solution exists only in rectangles whose sides are parallel to @xmath33 ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) , for quite general domains , we proposed a variational argument to select the , roughly speaking , `` most regular '' solutions to ( [ see ] ) , through the minimization of the set of the irregularities of their gradient .",
    "more precisely we considered the functional @xmath34 where the lower script denotes partial differentiation , @xmath35 is a continuous increasing function such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the distance in the @xmath38 norm .",
    "the fractal behavior of the singular set of a solution could be spread also in the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , these pathological solutions should not be considered as good candidates for our selection principle .",
    "this is why we considered this functional over the set of solutions @xmath39 to ( [ see ] ) such that @xmath40 .",
    "the weight function @xmath41 has been introduced to deal with the general fractal behavior of the solutions near the boundary .",
    "we observe that the knowledge of the pyramidal construction of cellina is twofold for our result . on one hand ,",
    "the analysis of the regularities of its gradient has inspired the choice of the energy functional and on the other one , it is a key ingredient in the proof of the existence of a minimizer for @xmath42 .",
    "indeed it allows to give a meaning to the variational problem providing an explicit solution @xmath43 with bounded energy , i.e. with @xmath44 .",
    "our aim in this paper is to extend this variational approach to the selection of solutions to a vectorial problem . passing from the scalar to the vectorial case",
    ", several difficulties come into play .",
    "for example , there is not a suitable notion of viscosity solution neither a general way of constructing a simple pyramid in the spirit of cellina s works .",
    "an explicit construction of solutions has been provided for the problem @xmath45 with @xmath46 denoting the orthogonal group of matrices of @xmath47 in @xcite and @xcite . in both papers",
    "the authors exhibit an explicit solution in a square and a cube , in the spirit of the cellina s pyramid of the scalar setting , but far from being so simple .",
    "in particular , these so called _ vectorial pyramids _ , @xmath48 , are again maps whose gradient takes only a finite number of values , @xmath49 , but for any @xmath29 the set @xmath50 is disconnected , with infinitely many connected components",
    ". therefore the solution has a fractal behavior at the boundary .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the scalar case . indeed",
    "if one uses a vitali covering argument to define a solution in a general domain @xmath1 , by patching the rescaled vectorial pyramids , he obtains a solution with a fractal behavior of its singular set also in the interior of @xmath1 and not only near the boundary .",
    "we do not know if in the case of a general domain there exists a solution without fractal behavior in the interior of @xmath1 and only at the boundary , as in the case of the square .",
    "therefore a selection principle should take into account this possibility .",
    "the present study stems from the analysis of the properties of the vectorial pyramid constructed in @xcite as a special solution to the dirichlet problem @xmath51 as for the construction in the scalar case , only a finite subset @xmath52 has been considered , namely @xmath53 in @xcite , the authors constructed an explicit solution @xmath48 in @xmath54 ( cfr .",
    "section [ subsec : dmp - construction ] ) of @xmath55    here we propose a variational criterion to select a solution of problem in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "the vectorial pyramid @xmath48 will play the same role as the pyramid @xmath56 of the scalar case .",
    "as already observed , the main source of difficulties , that also characterize the main novelty of the paper , is the necessity to take into account the possibility of a fractal behavior of the singularities of a given solution @xmath43 in @xmath1 .",
    "to this aim , we define @xmath57 to be the set where the singularities of @xmath43 accumulate ( cfr .",
    "definition [ def : sigmainfty ] ) and we consider the energy functional @xmath58 where @xmath59 will depend on the geometry of the domain @xmath1 ( see definitions [ defn : compatible - triang ] and [ defn : compatibledomain ] ) .",
    "the choice of the functional @xmath60 has been motivated by the idea that solutions with a small singular set @xmath61 should be preferred .",
    "the role of the first term of @xmath62 is to discard pathological solutions with @xmath61 not locally bounded with respect to the @xmath63-measure and to control its fractal behavior at the boundary .",
    "the second term , roughly speaking , minimizes the singularities of @xmath64 in @xmath1 .",
    "the weight depending on the distance from @xmath61 is actually necessary since in general we can not prevent the singularities of @xmath64 to accumulate near @xmath61 and to be supported in a @xmath63-dimensional set with infinite lenght .",
    "let us observe also that , in the case when the fractal behavior of @xmath64 is concentrated only near the boundary of @xmath1 , ( e.g. if we consider the vectorial pyramid @xmath48 in the square @xmath65 as in @xcite ) , the first term in @xmath60 is identically zero and the second term performs the selection by choosing the solutions that minimize the weighted length of the jumps of the gradient .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is a compatible domain , according to definition [ defn : compatibledomain ] . as we will see , this hypothesis is important to prove that our variational problem is well posed , in a suitable subclass of solutions to ( [ opgg ] ) , that we denote by @xmath66 .",
    "we prove the existence of a minimizer of @xmath62 for the maps @xmath43 in @xmath66 , for which @xmath61 has some `` good '' properties .",
    "more precisely , under suitable assumptions about the connectedness of @xmath61 and on its @xmath67-measure ( see theorem [ thm : main ] ) , we can ensure compactness and semicontinuity of the functional @xmath62 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we fix the notations , recall some preliminaries results of geometric measure theory needed in the sequel and we describe the vectorial pyramidal construction in the square of @xcite . in section [ sec : propertiessolutions ] we study some properties of lipschitz vector valued maps whose gradient takes only a finite number of values . for a given @xmath43 of such type",
    "we define the set @xmath61 and we study some of its properties .",
    "section [ sec : energybound ] is devoted to the study of the compactness and semicontinuity properties of the functional @xmath60 .",
    "in section [ sec : funzionalefinito ] we present some quite general classes of domains where our selection principle , based on minimization of the functional @xmath62 can be applied .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath68 and @xmath69 we denote the @xmath70-dimensional lebesgue measure and the @xmath71-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
