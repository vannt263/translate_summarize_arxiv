    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relatively narrow permitted optical emission lines ( h@xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10 2000 @xmath11 ) and a high /h@xmath8 ratio @xcite .",
    "historically , the ratio [ ] @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 has also been used as a defining criteria for the nls1 objects , although it now appears that this is not a good indicator @xcite .",
    "such properties place these galaxies at the lower end of the line - width distribution for the seyfert 1 population , thus distinguishing them from the bulk of seyfert 1 galaxies ( hereafter `` broad - line seyfert 1s '' or bls1s ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find nls1s to exist as one extreme of their primary eigenvector , and conclude that the dominant source of differences in the observed optical properties of low - redshift agn is a fundamental parameter ( which balances fe ii excitation against the illumination of the narrow line region ) .    in the x - ray regime ,",
    "nls1s exhibit rapid and large - amplitude variability ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bbf96 ) .",
    "@xcite showed x - ray variability to be systematically more extreme in nls1s than in bls1s despite both having the same luminosity distribution .",
    "for a given luminosity , nls1s show an order of magnitude greater variability , as measured by @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "some nls1s show x - ray flares up to a factor of 100 , on timescales of days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to the factors of @xmath0 a few seen in bls1s .",
    "( 0.12.4 kev ) observations revealed that the nls1 soft x - ray continuum slopes are systematically steeper than those of bls1s ( bbf96 ) , the photon index @xmath2 ( photon flux @xmath16 ) sometimes exceeding 3 .",
    "this phenomenon was found to extend to higher energies using _ asca _ ( 210 kev ) observations @xcite .",
    "the very strong anticorrelation between h@xmath8 @xmath9 and both the x - ray spectral slope in seyferts ( bbf96 ) and in quasars @xcite and `` excess variance '' @xcite suggests that the remarkable x - ray properties of nls1s represent an extreme of seyfert activity , possibly due to an extreme value of a fundamental physical parameter related to the accretion process .",
    "a popular explanation of the differences in x - ray properties across the seyfert population is that nls1s have relatively low masses for the central black hole .",
    "smaller black - hole masses naturally explain both the narrowness of the optical emission lines , which are generated in gas that has relatively small keplerian velocities , and the extreme x - ray variability , since the primary emission would originate in a smaller region around the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that nls1s have comparable luminosity to that of the bls1s , @xcite suggested that they must be emitting at higher fractions of their eddington luminosity , hence higher fractional accretion rates ( @xmath17 ) are also required .",
    "the closer the luminosity to the eddington limit ( and the lower the black - hole mass ) , the greater the fraction of the energy emitted by the accretion disk in the soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "thus nls1s might be expected to show disk components which peak at higher energies than for bls1s . @xcite and @xcite noted that soft photons from the disk may compton - cool hard x - rays from the corona , and cause the steep observed photon indices . in the case of a high accretion rate , the surface of the disk",
    "is also expected to be highly ionized @xcite ; evidence of reflection from such a disk ( from fe k@xmath7 ) is found in six nls1s : @xcite , @xcite for ton s180 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for akn 564 ; @xcite for the previous sources plus mrk 335 , ngc 4051 , pg 1244 + 026 , and pks 0558 - 504 .",
    "however , lines from ionized fe are not unique to the nls1 population , since they sometimes occur in bls1s as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternative explanations of the difference in observed parameters across the seyfert population include the possibility that nls1s have broad - line regions more distant from the nucleus than bls1s and hence smaller keplerian line widths @xcite , or that nls1s are observed preferentially close to face on .",
    "the latter is disfavored by the analysis of @xcite , and the fact that the inner regions of bls1s also appear to be observed close to face - on @xcite .",
    "the former possibility can be tested by measuring the size of the broad - line region using reverberation mapping .",
    "reverberation mapping uses measurements of the correlations between emission - line and continuum flux variations across a broad energy band to determine the size - scales of the emitting regions @xcite .",
    "line profiles give the kinematics of the emitting gas , and combining the size and velocity information yields an estimate of the central mass of an agn @xcite .",
    "results obtained to date have indicated that for nls1s @xmath18 , as opposed to @xmath19 for bls1s , while nls1s and bls1s appear to have broad - line regions which are comparable in size @xcite .",
    "akn  564 ( iras 22403 + 2927 , mgc + 05 - 53 - 012 ) is a bright , nearby nls1 with @xmath20 , @xcite ; @xmath21 mag , @xcite , and @xmath22 ^-1 ergs s@xmath23(from these data ) ; hence an ideal test case for accretion disk models of agn .",
    "_ rosat _ observations @xcite showed a complex soft x - ray spectrum with spectral features around @xmath6 kev .",
    "however , the _ pspc _ data could not discriminate between absorption or emission as the origin of the complex form of the spectrum .",
    "subsequent _ asca _ observations ( @xmath24 ks , @xcite ) confirmed the complexity of the soft spectrum and showed a strong iron line at rest energy of about 7 kev , indicative of reflection from highly ionized material .",
    "this conclusion was supported by @xcite who detected an edge at 8.5 kev in combined _ asca _ and _ rxte _ data , attributable to reflection from a strongly irradiated disk .",
    "_ bepposax _ data @xcite are also indicative of reflection from a highly ionized , optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "the most intensive broad - band reverberation mapping program undertaken to date aimed to determine the nature of the relationship between x - ray and uv  optical continuum variations and thus obtain an estimate of the blr size and virial mass of the central source in the nls1 galaxy , akn  564 .",
    "this campaign was designed to obtain the first estimate for a nls1 of the size of the region emitting the broad uv lines , and it provided the longest baseline for a quasi - continuous x - ray study of any agn to date ( i.e interrupted only by earth occultation , saa passage etc ) .",
    "akn  564 was observed by _",
    "asca _ on 2000 june 1 to july 6 , during a multiwavelength monitoring campaign that included observations from _ hst _ between may 9 and july 8 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* paper iii ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the results from the @xmath0 1 ms asca observation of akn  564 . in   [ dataobs ]",
    "we present the data ; in   [ timevar ] we discuss the time variability of the source ; ",
    "[ meansp ] we analyze the mean spectrum ; in   [ timesel ]",
    "we discuss time - resolved spectroscopy ; ",
    "[ rms ] presents an investigation of the rms spectrum ;   [ ccresults ] looks at the correlations between the x - ray parameters , and with the uv flux at 1365  ;   [ results ] presents a summary of our observational results ; finally , in   [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the x - ray results .",
    "_ asca _ is equipped with four focal - plane detectors that are operated simultaneously , namely , two ccds ( the solid - state imaging spectrometers sis-0 and sis-1 , 0.410 kev , @xcite ) and two gas - scintillation proportional - counters ( gas imaging spectrometers gis-2 and gis-3 , 0.710 kev , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) .",
    "asca obtained a total duration of @xmath25 ms on akn  564 , starting from jd @xmath26 ( for the screened data ) .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techiques as described in @xcite ; in particular , the methods and screening criteria utilized by the _ tartarus_[multiblock footnote omitted ] database @xcite were used .",
    "data screening yielded an effective exposure time of @xmath27 ms for the siss and @xmath28 ms for the giss .",
    "the mean sis-0 count rate was 1.894 @xmath29 ^-1 cts s@xmath23 ( 0.610 kev band ) .",
    "[ sistrouble ] since launch in 1993 , the _ asca _ sis detectors have been experiencing a degradation in efficiency at the lower energies , which is probably due to increased dark current levels and decreased charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) , producing sis spectra which diverge from each other and from the gis data .",
    "this loss in efficiency is not well understood and therefore not corrected for by any of the software ( in particular , correctrdd does not solve the problem ) , so that the discrepancy between sis-1 and giss can be as much as 40% below 0.6 kev for data taken in january 2000[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "data from the last phase of _ asca _ operations , ao-8 , revealed that there has been a non - linear evolution of the sis cte .",
    "the akn  564 data were first calibrated using linear extrapolations of sis gain from the last determination of cte values on 1997 march 11 .",
    "that calibration produced unacceptably large inconsistencies between the sis and gis instruments up to a few kev .",
    "thus the previous solution of excluding sis data below 0.6 kev is inadequate .",
    "we recalculated the sis gain using the interim solution released on 2001 february 13 ( using cte file @xmath30 ) .",
    "this interim solution reduced the instrument discrepancies significantly , but still necessitated the exclusion of some sections of the sis data .",
    "for this reason , we proceed as follows .",
    "we have modelled the features which appear in both gis and sis detectors and ignored residuals which are in one instrument or instrument pair only ( and are likely artifacts of calibration problems ) .",
    "we then used our simple parameterization of the data to examine the time - variability of the source spectrum .",
    "[ yaqoob ] the divergence of the sis detectors at low energies can be partly corrected for in the spectral analysis .",
    "one approach @xcite[multiblock footnote omitted ] , is to quantify the apparent loss in sis efficiency as a function of time throughout the mission ; an empirical correction can be applied by parameterizing the efficiency loss with a time - dependent absorption ( `` excess n_h n@xmath31 '' ) .",
    "the correction for sis-0 follows the linear relationship , @xmath32 @xmath33 , where t is the average of start and stop times of the observation , based on seconds since launch .",
    "there is no simple analytical relationship that satisfies the sis-1 excess n_h n@xmath31 , but it is usually found that a slightly larger column can be applied to the sis1 data to bring it into line with sis0 .",
    "naturally , one has to be extremely conservative in interpreting spectral features derived from fits in the lower - energy region , in particular below 1 kev , once this empirical correction has been applied . for our observation , where t @xmath34 s , @xmath35 @xmath33 and we adopted @xmath36 @xmath33 .",
    "a more conservative approach consists of only considering data above 1 kev for both sis and gis , where the disagreement is less dramatic .",
    "however , as we are very interested in the variability of the soft hump spectral component , in this paper , we will use the excess @xmath37 correction for our fitting .",
    "light curves were extracted using bin sizes of 256 s , and 5760 s in the full - band ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) for the sis , a soft - band ( 0.71.3 kev ) for the sis data , and the hard - band ( 210 kev ) for both gis and sis data . the use of 0.7 kev as a lower limit for the sis data was due to the high setting for the sis lower level discriminator towards the end of the observation . in all cases",
    "we combined the data from the sis and gis detector pairs .",
    "the exposure requirements for the combined curves were that the bins be fully exposed in each instrument for the 256 s curves and at least 10 % exposed for the 5760s curves .",
    "the observed count rates correspond to a mean 210 kev flux of @xmath38 @xmath39 and 210 kev luminosity @xmath40 ^-1 ergs s@xmath23 ( assuming @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 ) .",
    "this mean flux level is @xmath0 20 % brighter than that observed during a previous _ asca _ observation in 1996 december 23 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ lcv2 ] shows the combined 0.71.3 kev sis soft - band and gis hard - band light curves in 5760 s bins .",
    "the background level in the source cell is about 4 % of the source count rate , and not plotted or subtracted .",
    "figure  [ lcv2 ] also shows the softness ratio , defined as the ratio between the count rates in the 0.71.3 and 210 kev bands .",
    "the spectrum hardens during the _ asca _ observation .",
    "the light curves binned to 5760 s show trough - to - peak variations in flux by a factor of @xmath44 in the 0.71.3 kev band ( sis ) , @xmath45 in the 210 kev band ( gis ) .",
    "examination of light curves binned to 256 s reveals even larger amplitudes due to fast flickering .",
    "the maximum amplitude of variability in these ( 256 s ) curves is a factor @xmath1 for the sis data in the 0.7 - 1.3 kev band and @xmath46 for the gis data in the 210 kev band . in their figure  3 ,",
    "@xcite show the 0.71.3 kev and 210 kev light curves , in 256 s bins , for a `` flare '' at jd @xmath47 2451710 ( centered around 1153 ks after the start of the observation ) .",
    "the sis and gis data show rate variations of a factor of 1.4 and 1.8 ( respectively ) in @xmath48 s , corresponding to a variation in luminosity of @xmath49 ^-1 ergs s@xmath23 .",
    "the close - up examination of that flare shows that the hard x - ray event is sharper than that in the soft band , and that there is a significant change in softness ratio on a timescale of @xmath5 s @xcite .",
    "close examination of the light curve reveals other similar examples of rapid changes in spectral shape and also some flares which are not accompanied by a strong spectral change .",
    "the behavior of the source is obviously complex with some events characteristically different to others .",
    "here we concentrate on the search for variations in spectral parameters across the 35 day baseline of the observation to understand the nature of the spectral variability .",
    "a more detailed timing analysis is presented in a complementary paper , @xcite .      the fractional variability amplitude @xmath50 is defined in @xcite , as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total variance of the light curve",
    ", @xmath53 is the mean error squared , and @xmath54 is the mean count rate .",
    "the error on @xmath50 , also from @xcite , is @xmath55    the quantity @xmath50 was calculated every @xmath0 day using even sampling and constructing light curves with 256 s bins .",
    "we examined the quantity in the soft ( 0.71.3 kev ) band and the hard ( 210 kev ) band .",
    "these bands were chosen to be as widely separated as possible in the energy - bandpass , but having good signal - to - noise in each curve .",
    "@xmath50 is variable across the observation , but there appears to be no correlation between this quantity and the flux - state of the source , probably due to a random nature of the light curve .",
    "@xmath50 appears very well correlated between the soft and hard bands . as we will demonstrate in ",
    "[ meansp ] , in the mean spectrum the power - law continuum provides about 75 % of the flux in the 0.71.3 kev band .",
    "the rapid variations in the power - law component dominate the variability so the two bands have a correlated component of variability , making @xmath50 appear similar , to first order , in the soft and hard bands .",
    "@xmath50 calculated across the whole dataset is 34.84 % @xmath56 0.46 for the 0.71.3 kev band , and 33.19 % @xmath56 0.40 for the 210 kev band .",
    "this quantity measures deviations compared to the mean , integrated over the entire month .",
    "the slightly greater @xmath50 for the soft band is probably due to the relatively strong variation in the soft component occurring over a month timescale , as we will show in   [ humpfits ] .",
    "for the spectral analysis the source counts were grouped with a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin . after",
    "examining the spectral fits separately to quantify the cross - calibration problems ( as described in   [ sistrouble ] ) , the data were fit allowing the relative normalization of the four instruments to be free to allow for small differences in calibration of the absolute flux , and differences in the fraction of encircled counts contained within the sis and gis extraction cells .",
    "the spectral fits have been performed with the xspec v11.0.1 package , using the response matrices released in 1997 for the gis , and response files generated using heasoft v5.0.4 for the sis .",
    "the spectral continuum slope was first determined by fitting a power - law model modified by galactic absorption ( @xmath57 @xmath33 , @xcite ) , and corrected for the sis low - energy problem as described in   [ sistrouble ] . for this fit we used data in the bandpass 25 plus 7.510 kev data in the rest - frame ( @xmath0 1.84.9 kev observer s frame ) .",
    "furthermore , we excluded sis data in the 1.72.5 kev regime and above 7.32 kev ( both observer s frame ) due to problems in the calibration that show up in data of such high signal - to - noise .",
    "the power - law fit yielded @xmath58 and @xmath59 for 1225 degrees of freedom ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this and subsequent errors represent , unless otherwise specified , the 90 % confidence level .",
    "the data / model ratio is shown in figure  [ pl_rat ] , along with the good data overlaid relative to this continuum model , and also the bad ( excluded ) data , shown as a different point - style .",
    "a strong soft excess is evident which appears as a hump of emission , rising above the power - law continuum below 2 kev , then flattening off below 1 kev , as observed in an earlier _ asca _ observation @xcite ; hereafter we refer to this component as the soft hump .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the shape of the soft hump is evident in the pspc spectrum .",
    "we constructed a data / model spectral ratio for the archival _ rosat _ pspc data from 1993 .",
    "the data were compared to a power - law model of the mean slope noted above .",
    "the pspc data between 1.52.0 kev were used to normalize this component ( there being insufficient bandpass to determine the hard x - ray slope ) and the rest of the spectral data were then overlaid .",
    "the ratio is shown in the inset panel of figure  [ pl_rat ] , demonstrating that the soft x - ray spectrum turns up again between 0.40.5 kev .",
    "( even if the power - law index is different at the epoch of the pspc observation , we could not introduce the structure observed in the soft x - ray spectral shape . )",
    "also evident in the main panel is an excess of emission close to 7 kev , which we know to be due to an unmodeled fe k@xmath7 line .",
    "the overlay of the excluded bad points serves to show where the strongest problems are , due to the detector aging and calibration issues described in   [ sistrouble ] .",
    "the status of the calibration , the degradation of the sis energy - resolution towards the end of the mission , and the small bandpass of data available to examine the soft hump component conspire to make it impossible to achieve an unambiguous parameterization of the hump shape using these data .",
    "this led us to use a very simple parameterization of the hump in order to simply examine its flux variability .",
    "a previous detailed study of akn  564 @xcite detected the soft hump and ruled out origins solely due to the effects of emission and/or absorption from photoionized gas .",
    "models based upon emission from thermal gas were consistent with the spectral data , but posed problems in terms of physical consistency with the picture of an agn @xcite . in light of the _ chandra _ results for the nls1s ton s180 @xcite and ngc  4051 @xcite",
    "that the hump is apparently a smooth continuum component , a variability study such as this has turned out to be a better technique to understand the nature of the soft hump than high resolution spectroscopy , as shown below in   [ humpfits ] .",
    "the lack of constraints on the form of the soft hump lead us to use a simple gaussian parameterization of the component .",
    "this adequately models the shape and flux of the excess in the _ asca _ data , and allows us to study the variability of the component using time - resolved spectroscopy . using sis data in the range 0.751.7 and 2.54.88 kev simultaneously with gis data in the range 1.04.88 and 7.329.76 kev ( observer s frame ) , the gaussian model which best fits the excess has a peak energy @xmath61 kev , width @xmath62 kev and normalization @xmath63 @xmath64 corresponding to a mean equivalent width ( ew)@xmath65 ev .",
    "a significant fe k@xmath7 emission line is evident in the _ asca _ spectrum ( figure  [ pl_rat ] ) .",
    "the line profile is asymmetric with a marked red wing , as observed in seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite , but with a peak close to 7 kev .",
    "these basic properties of the line will be robust to refinements to the instrument calibrations .",
    "we utilized sis data in the range 2.57.32 kev simultaneously with the gis data in the range 1.89.76 kev .",
    "a narrow gaussian component is an inadequate model for the line profile , but allows us to determine that the line peak is at an observed energy of 7.1 kev .",
    "the asymmetry of the line led us to fit the data with a disk - line model profile @xcite .",
    "the model assumes a schwarzschild geometry and we assumed an emissivity law @xmath66 for the illumination pattern of the accretion disk , where @xmath67 is the radial distance from the black hole .",
    "we assume the line originates between 6 and 1000 gravitational radii ( @xmath68 ) and we constrained the rest - energy of the line to lie between 6.4 and 7 kev ( as this first test is for fe k@xmath7 and this range represents the rest - energies possible for this line , depending on ionization - state of the reprocessing gas ) .",
    "the inclination of the system is defined such that @xmath69 is a disk oriented face - on to the observer .",
    "this model gave @xmath70 for 2481 @xmath60 for a fit including the full range of good data .",
    "the rest - energy of the line was @xmath71 kev , i.e. the energy pegged at the upper limit allowed in the fit .",
    "the inclination was @xmath72 degrees , emissivity index was @xmath73 and normalization @xmath74 ^-1 ^ -2 photons s@xmath23 @xmath33 .",
    "the equivalent width was ew@xmath75 ev .",
    "the index was @xmath76 in this model , i.e. consistent with that obtained by fitting for the continuum alone .",
    "while the fit is statistically poor , the contributions to @xmath77 are dominated by a few areas where the data from the four instruments diverge , due to problems with the calibration for data from this epoch .",
    "no systematic residuals remain which are present in all instruments .",
    "next we tested a model for the line profile assuming a kerr metric , as implemented by @xcite , for a maximally rotating black hole which will have the most intense gravitational effects . in this case",
    "we fixed the innermost radius as the last stable orbit for a kerr hole , and the outer radius at the maximum value allowed by the model , 400 @xmath68 .",
    "the kerr model provides a fit - statistic @xmath78 for @xmath79 , an improvement ( at 95 % confidence ) over the schwarzschild model .",
    "the rest - energy of the line was @xmath80 kev , inclination was @xmath81 degrees , emissivity index was @xmath82 and normalization @xmath83 ^-1 ^ -2 photons s@xmath23 @xmath33 .",
    "the equivalent width was ew@xmath84 ev .",
    "the photon index was @xmath85 .",
    "analysis of previous short _ asca _ observations revealed some ambiguity as to whether the fe k@xmath7 line arose from ionized material , or a disk highly inclined to the line - of - sight @xcite , therefore we explicitly tested for an origin in neutral material . if the line energy is fixed at 6.4 kev , but all other parameters are allowed to vary , then the fit - statistics are @xmath86 for the schwarzschild model , and @xmath87 for the kerr model .",
    "these fits are significantly worse than those which show a line energy close to 7 kev , thus we conclude that the fe k@xmath7 ( ly@xmath7 ) emission in akn  564 does originate in highly ionized material , dominated by emission from fexxvi ( h - like ) ions .",
    "the line energies derived are indicative that h - like fe dominates more than he - like fe .",
    "however , we consider this to be an area which requires revisiting with the forthcoming improvements to gis and sis calibration , and drawing firm conclusions on the relative importance of he - like and h - like ions would be premature with the calibration used here .",
    "the residuals to the kerr fit are shown in figure  [ lybeta ] .",
    "there is a significant excess of emission suggestive of an additional emission line just above 8 kev ( this shows up in both the giss whose data we used , and examination of the disguarded sis data in this range also revealed the line component ) . using a narrow gaussian model to fit this excess revealed a line energy @xmath88 kev , with equivalent width @xmath89 ev .",
    "the addition of this line to the model improves the fit by @xmath90 .",
    "this excess is identified as a combination of the k@xmath8 line of fexxvi ( ly@xmath8 ) and the k@xmath7 line of ni ( ni ly@xmath7 ; see discussion ) .",
    "the addition of this line - blend to our models does not change significantly the implied parameters of the rest of the fit .",
    "this line blend has a width consistent with that of the fe k@xmath7 line , although line widths should be revisited with the final _ asca _ calibration . allowing an additional narrow line component within rest energy - range 6.47.0 kev",
    "did not improve upon the fit obtained with the kerr model , @xmath91 .",
    "the 90 % upper limit on a narrow line with rest - energy between 6.47.0 kev is @xmath92 ev .    in light of the evidence for ionized material",
    ", we also tested for the presence of an fe k edge .",
    "the fit did not improve on addition of this model component ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "in order to make a direct comparison with vaughan et al ( 1999 ) we calculated the 90 % confidence upper limit on an edge at 8.76 kev ( from he - like fe ) , which is @xmath94 . in light of the strong emission features it is difficult to understand the apparent absence of an fe edge .",
    "we suspect the edge is present , and that the improved calibration of _ asca _ may later make it easier to precisely model this complex region of the spectrum .",
    "the spectral - energy - distribution of akn  564 is relatively depressed in the optical and uv regime leading @xcite to suggest that the unusual uv ( @xmath95 ) to 2 kev flux ratio in akn  564 could be due to absorption of the uv continuum . @xcite",
    "use the observed heii @xmath96 ratio and the continuum shape in the uv / optical regime to derive a e(b - v ) = 0.17 ( galactic = 0.03 , intrinsic=0.14 ) as the total reddening for akn  564 . for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio",
    "this implies a column @xmath97  @xmath33 of absorption in the x - ray band .",
    "we found this column of gas to be consistent with the x - ray data , and the presence of some absorber would lead to attenuation in the soft x - ray regime , and could thus explain the significant curvature ( flattening ) of the soft hump component below 1 kev (   [ meanhump ] ) .",
    "however , again we stress that the absolute form of the soft hump is not the primary goal of this paper , rather the insights obtained from the variability of the component .",
    "in order to construct a complete picture of the multi - waveband variability of an agn , one must consider the variations of x - ray spectral parameters .",
    "simple flux - flux correlations can miss important clues to the emission and reprocessing mechanisms at work . in order to study the spectral evolution of akn 564",
    ", we created 40 time - selected spectra across the 35 day observation .",
    "we sampled throughout the light curve following flares and dips using xselect v2.0 .",

    "in addition to changes in slope , we note that the power - law component dominates the 210 kev band , thus rapid flux variations observed down to timescales of @xmath5 s in that band are attributable to flux changes in the power - law continuum .    as an illustrative way of examining these spectral variations we constructed a plot to highlight the different aspects of the spectral evolution .",

    "@xmath2 is also plotted against the strength of the soft hump component , showing no evidence for a correlation between the two ( figure  [ nocorr ] ) .",
    "another concern is that one might expect to see an anti - correlation between the fluxes of the hump and power - law if they were difficult to separate in the spectral fit .",
    "however , figure  [ nocorr ] demonstrates that the high - state data have a systematically higher strength for the soft hump than the low - state .",
    "this suggests that the two spectral components are well - separated in the fitting process , and that the two components have a close physical connection .",
    "figure  [ allratios ] indicates that the hump undergoes changes in shape on timescales down to days , as evident ( for example ) by comparison of panels for time - cuts 13 and 35 .",
    "however , the changes are small relative to the variations in flux of the hump , thus our model with fixed shape for the hump parameterizes most of the flux in the hump at each epoch .",
    "thus , the evidence for some variation in hump shape does not compromise our approach in fixing the shape when testing for flux variability .",
    "we performed a final test , to check our result was not due to variations in the sis soft response on timescales of weeks .",

    "this test strongly confirmed our result , that the soft hump flux falls during the course of this observation , and that this can not be attributed to any instrumental effects in the _ asca _ data .      in order to investigate the variability of the fe emission line , we utilized sis data in the range 2.57.32 kev simultaneously with the gis data in the range 1.89.76 kev .",

    "returning to the 40 time - selected spectra , we fit those data with a model having free parameters of photon index , the normalization of the power law , and the normalization of the line complex ( using the shape parameters from the kerr fit to the mean profile ) , no model component was included for the soft hump , as the soft - band data were excluded for this test .",
    "figure  [ 40fits ] shows the time series for the k@xmath7 line",
    ". fits to a constant model yield @xmath109 .",
    "thus the line does not show significant changes in flux when sampled on this timescale .    as an alternative test we split the data into 8 intervals , to sample an intermediate timescale of several days per integration .",

    "a model was constructed using the mean fe line profile complex from   [ meanfek ] and now assuming the line * flux * also is constant .",
    "the soft - band data were excluded , as for all the fe line fits performed to date , and so the only free parameters in the fit were photon index and normalization of the power law .",
    "if the line is a constant flux component on top of the power - law throughout the observation , then by fitting for the local continuum slope and flux in each interval , one should be able to obtain an acceptable fit for each of the eight intervals .",

    "the shortest timescale on which one can see some indication for line variability is in comparison of the first two intervals ( figure  [ 8fe ] ) , taking the start time of the first interval , and stop time of the second then this constrains the line to arise in a region @xmath110 light seconds , or @xmath0 1 light week in size . taking the intervals with strongest contrast in residuals ( 1 and 4 )",

    "this result confirms that the line flux and equivalent width both vary during this _ asca _ observation .",
    "there can not be a simple correlation between soft hump flux and fe line strength , if that was the case , we would expect to see a gradual decrease in line strength ( in figure  [ 8fe ] ) as the hump strength went down dramatically across the observation ; a correlated drop in line strength is not observed .",
    "we note the appearance of some absorption - type features at some epochs ( e.g.  interval 2 ) , we do not investigate these apparent minor changes to line profile , as such small effects are best investigated when the final _ asca _ calibration is made available .",
    "in optical / uv spectroscopy of agn , it is easy to obtain a series of spectra of sufficiently high s / n to perform time - resolved spectroscopic analysis . in this case , a useful way to isolate variable features is to construct a root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum .",

    "for each detector the 40 spectra have been rebinned so that each bin has at least a 5-sigma detection ( but up to a maximum of 10 adjacent bins were combined to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of 5 within a bin ) then they were degraded to the resolution of the worst spectrum ( i.e.  the spectrum with worst s / n determined the actual bin widths for them all ) .",
    "we created mean and rms spectra by calculating the simple mean and rms flux in each bin .",

    "this good correlation between the uv flux and the soft hump and the upper limit to the lag of @xmath129 d indicates a contribution to both bands by the same physical component , perhaps emission from the accretion disk .",
    "the uv / soft hump correlation and the apparent association of the soft hump with nls1s appears consistent with the idea that the disk peaks at a higher temperature in nls1s than bls1s , as expected if we are viewing thermal emission from a disk which is more highly ionized in the nls1 case @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these data do not allow us to distinguish whether the soft hump is due to reflected radiation from an ionized disk , thermal emission from the disk or a combination of both .",
    "the changes in the shape of the hump may indicate that it is the superposition of several different components of emission / reflection , which possess differing timescales of variability .",
    "in general , we find disk - corona models to be challenged by the lack of correlation of @xmath2 with the strength of the soft hump , presumably the seed photon source , which should cool the corona and cause a steepening in the power law as it increases in strength .",
    "one possibility is that the corona cooling is saturated , i.e. that even a significant reduction in the soft hump leaves a large enough soft - photon reservoir that the resulting spectrum is always strongly cooled .",
    "we defer a more detailed discussion of the multiwaveband lags and correlations , and reprocessing models , to paper iii @xcite .    an fe k@xmath7 line of high equivalent width is detected and clearly attributable to highly ionized material",
    "these are strong observational results which are robust to the current inaccuracies in calibration .",
    "analysis using the current calibration suggests a dominance of fexxvi ions in akn  564 ( yielding ly@xmath7 ) , although a blend of emission from several states is most likely .",
    "an additional line of equivalent width @xmath89 ev is detected , close to a rest energy of 8.2 kev .",
    "lines consistent with this energy are the k@xmath8 line from h - like fe ( ly@xmath8 ) and the k@xmath7 line from h - like ni ( ly@xmath7 ) . assuming solar abundances then the predicted equivalent width of fe k@xmath8 is 77 ev , and that of ni k@xmath7 is 35 ev , based on the strength of the fe k@xmath7 line .",

    "another possibility is that nls1s have high fe abundance . noting the high ews of fe k@xmath7 and the strong feii emission in nls1s @xcite suggested that high fe abundance might be a general property of nls1s ; furthermore , high metallicities are expected in some evolutionary models for nls1s @xcite .",
    "the high ew can not be due to a large solid angle for the reprocessor or a hidden hard x - ray component , as , in either of these cases we would observe a detectable flattening to high energies due to the presence of the associated compton hump .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data show variations in the fe k@xmath7 flux by a factor @xmath130 on timescales @xmath131 light seconds , indicating the bulk of the iron line originates within @xmath3 a light week of the nucleus .",
