    "supersymmetry was introduced in physics as a means to formulate bose ",
    "fermi symmetry in quantum field theory . since the advent of supergravity",
    ", it is usually connected to superstring theory .",
    "although this relationship is indeed intimate and fundamental , supersymmetry is also deeply rooted in the physics of condensed matter . the so - called _ supersymmetry method _ ,",
    "developed by efetov and wegner @xcite , has been used to great effect in the study of disordered systems , in particular in connection to the metal - insulator transition ; or in other words , in the analysis of localisation and delocalisation for certain random matrix ensembles @xcite .    in connection with the physics of thin wires ,",
    "the subject was well studied in the 1990s ; it has recently gained substantial new interest , since the ` symmetry classes ' investigated in this context @xcite have been found to occur as ` edge modes ' of certain 2d systems termed ` topological insulators ' ( resp .",
    "superconductors ) @xcite .",
    "mathematically , several aspects of the method beg justification .",
    "one both subtle and salient point is the transformation of certain integrals over flat superspace in high dimension @xmath0 , which encode statistical quantities of a given random matrix ensemble , into integrals over a curved superspace of fixed rank and dimension , more tractable to saddle - point analysis .",
    "this step relies on an integral transform , the so - called hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation @xcite , which , in its traditional form , assumes a gaussian distribution for the initial data .",
    "any generalisation beyond this class of random matrices is challenging analytically , severely limiting the range of the method : questions such as universality for invariant ensembles prompted the development of new , more robust and versatile tools .",
    "therefor , a new transform , dubbed ` superbosonisation ' , was introduced by efetov _",
    "@xcite , based on ideas of lehmann , saher , sokolov , and sommers @xcite , and of hackenbroich and weidenmller @xcite .",
    "sommers @xcite was the first to consider it for arbitrary probability distributions with unitary symmetry . in parallel , guhr @xcite , guhr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite defined a generalised hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation for non - gaussian ensembles .",
    "following the work of fyodorov @xcite in the non - supersymmetric situation , littelmann ",
    "sommers  zirnbauer in their seminal paper @xcite extended superbosonisation to include the cases of orthogonal and symplectic symmetry . at the same time , they gave a mathematically rigorous derivation of the superbosonisation identity .",
    "littelmann  sommers ",
    "zirnbauer @xcite also state that when both methods ( hubbard  stratonovich and superbosonisation ) are applicable , they are equivalent to each other ; this was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general , the superbosonisation identity holds in the unitary , orthogonal , and unitary - symplectic symmetry cases .",
    "we consider only unitary symmetry here , although our methods and results are not restricted to this case .",
    "one considers the space @xmath1 of square super - matrices and a certain subsupermanifold @xmath2 of purely even codimension with underlying manifold @xmath3 the product of the positive hermitian @xmath4 matrices with the unitary @xmath5 matrices .",
    "let @xmath6 be a superfunction defined and holomorphic on the tube domain based on @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath6 has sufficient decay at infinity along @xmath8 ( _ i.e. _  along @xmath9 ) , then the superbosonisation identity states @xmath10 where @xmath11 is some finite positive constant depending only on @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is the quadratic map @xmath16",
    ", @xmath17 is the standard berezinian density , and @xmath18 is a berezinian density on @xmath2 , invariant under a natural transitive supergroup action .    the precise meaning of all the quantities involved will be made clear in the course of the paper . however , let us remark that any superfunction on @xmath19 may be written in the form @xmath20 .",
    "a notable feature of the formula is thus that puts the ` hidden supersymmetries ' ( from @xmath21 ) into evidence through the invariant integral over the homogeneous superspace @xmath2 , whereas the ` manifest symmetries ' ( from @xmath22 ) only enter _ via _  some character ( namely , @xmath23 ) .",
    "a remarkable special case of the identity occurs when @xmath24 .",
    "then equation reduces to @xmath25 which is known as the bosonisation identity in physics .",
    "notice that the left - hand side is a purely fermionic berezin integral , whereas the right - hand side is purely bosonic .",
    "formally , it turns fermions @xmath26 into bosons @xmath27 .    in this case",
    ", the identity can be proved by the use of the schur orthogonality relations : it expresses the fact that , up to a constant factor , the @xmath28 homogeneous part of @xmath6 equals its projection onto the peter  weyl component @xmath29 with spherical vector @xmath30 .",
    "the doubling of degree is explained by viewing @xmath31 as the symmetric space @xmath32 ; for instance , @xmath33 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-representation on polynomials @xmath37 homogeneous of degree @xmath14 . for the case of @xmath38 ,",
    "the left - hand side is @xmath39 , up to some constant factor , and we obtain the cauchy integral formula .    on the other hand , if @xmath40 , then @xmath41 , and the right - hand side @xmath42 is the so - called ( unweighted ) _ riesz distribution_. in this case , equation is due to ingham and siegel @xcite .",
    "its first use in the context that inspired superbosonisation was by fyodorov @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known to admit a far - reaching generalisation in the framework of euclidean jordan algebras @xcite .",
    "this observation links the identity to equivariant geometry , lie theory , and harmonic analysis ; and thus forms the starting point of the present paper .",
    "our strategy is to exploit the transitive action of a certain supergroup on @xmath2 to compute the laplace transform @xmath43 of the functionals @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding transformed identity is easy to verify , since the laplace transform of the left - hand side is straightforward to evaluate .    of course",
    ", since the geometry is more complicated for @xmath45 , the evaluation of the right - hand side @xmath43 becomes more delicate .",
    "also , a theory of laplace transforms for superdistributions had to be developed , because it was unavailable in the literature . here , a technical difficulty is that @xmath44 is not obviously a superdistribution ( although _ a posteriori _ , equation shows that it is ) , but rather a functional on a space of holomorphic superfunctions .",
    "thus , we are obliged to study the laplace transformation on various different spaces of generalised functions .",
    "besides providing a conceptual framework in which equation follows with relative ease , our approach also establishes a connection to analytic representation theory that previously went unnoticed .",
    "namely , for a suitable choice of normalisation , the constant @xmath11 in equation is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the evaluation at @xmath48 of the meromorphic function of @xmath49 indeterminates , known as the gindikin @xmath50 function for @xmath40 . in",
    ", we explicitly determine @xmath51 for any @xmath52 , as follows : @xmath53 this function has zeros and poles for @xmath45 , whereas for @xmath40 , it only has poles .    when @xmath40 , this function is closely related to the @xmath54-function of the riemannian symmetric space @xmath41",
    "moreover , the renormalised riesz distribution @xmath55 defines the unitary structure on the holomorphic discrete series representation of @xmath56 whose lowest @xmath57-type is the character @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the gindikin @xmath50 function @xmath59 also appears in the @xmath60-function equation for the relatively invariant polynomial @xmath61 , _ via _",
    "@xmath62 here , @xmath63 is the polynomial differential operator obtained by inserting the matrix @xmath64 of coordinate derivations into the determinant .",
    "this leads to a functional equation for @xmath65 which can be exploited to give a meromorphic extension of @xmath65 as a distribution - valued function of @xmath14 .",
    "this fact was famously applied by rossi and vergne in their proof of the analytic extension of the holomorphic discrete series @xcite .",
    "the implications of these connections for the representation theory of supergroups will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "let us give a brief synopsis of the paper s contents . in section [ sec : two ] , we give the basic setup for the statement and proof of the superbosonisation formula , introducing the relevant supergroups and the functionals which define both sides of the equation .",
    "we give a proof of the identity in , up to the computation of the laplace transform @xmath43 of the right - hand side , which is deferred to section [ sec : lap - conical ] .",
    "in that section , we actually discuss more generally the so - called conical superfunctions attached to @xmath2 , and determine their laplace transforms .",
    "the main step is the explicit determination of the gindikin @xmath50 function @xmath59 , in .",
    "the paper is complemented with an extensive appendix . in appendix",
    "[ app : functorpoints ] , we discuss the language of ( generalised ) points , which will be an indispensable tool .",
    "appendix [ app : super - int ] covers the theory of berezinian fibre integrals , which is used throughout section [ sec : lap - conical ] .",
    "finally , the theory of generalised superfunctions and their laplace transforms is developed in appendix [ app : super - lap ] .",
