    "observations of high - energy photons from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have much contributed to a deeper understanding of their nature .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission observed by the egret detector @xcite suggests a power - law spectrum extending up to gev energies .",
    "this favours an optically thin emission region and a non - thermal origin of the bursts .",
    "as the excessive pair production could be suppressed in the presence of relativistic jets @xcite , it was concluded that relativistic beaming could play an important role for grbs @xcite .",
    "however , other models also point towards the presence of a strong thermal component in the grb spectra @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath1-rays at highest energies is expected to have an important impact on the modelling of the emission processes , in particular of the early and late afterglow phases of grbs .",
    "egret measurements generally showed the presence of a hard , long - duration component @xcite , consistent with a simple extrapolation of the mev spectrum into the high - energy @xmath1-ray regime .",
    "recently , an additional , delayed high - energy component of grb970417 was found with the tasc detector of egret @xcite .",
    "several models predict gev - tev emission lasting up to the early afterglow @xcite . due to the extremely high energies attainable inside relativistic jets , grbs are potential sources of very high energy ( vhe ) cosmic rays @xcite , that can produce in their turn hadronic showers containing vhe @xmath1-rays .",
    "other theoretical models predict no emission above few mev @xcite or predict strong emission up to gev , but no emission above 10 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements at this energy range can be used to test all these competing models . however , as most of the observed grbs occur at large redshift , strong attenuation of the vhe @xmath1 flux is expected , as a result of the interaction with low energy photons of the metagalactic radiation field ( mrf ) @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the redshift is , therefore , important for a precise interpretation . on the other hand ,",
    "a detection of vhe @xmath1-rays provides an indirect  and model dependent  upper limit of its redshift , if some knowledge of the mrf is assumed .",
    "several observations of grbs at energies above hundred gev have been attempted @xcite , without showing any indication of a signal .",
    "this is due to a relatively low sensitivity , as in satellite - borne detectors , and/or a high energy threshold , as in previous generation of cherenkov telescopes or in particle detector arrays . up to now ,",
    "only upper limits on the prompt or delayed emission of grbs were set by whipple @xcite , milagro ( see * ? ? ? * and refs .",
    "therein ) , and stacee @xcite .",
    "stacee , in the same energy region as attainable by magic , was able to follow grb050607 after @xmath2 for 1150  s and set an upper limit of its flux as @xmath3  c.u .",
    "( _ crab units _ : @xmath4 )",
    ".    the situation may change with the new generation of cherenkov telescopes , which achieve a better flux sensitivity and a lower energy threshold .",
    "nevertheless , as their small field of view does allow prompt observations only by serendipitous detection , they have to rely on an _ external triggering _ , as the one provided by the automated satellite link to the _ gamma - ray burst coordinates network _ ( gcn ) , which broadcasts the coordinates of events triggered and selected by dedicated satellite detectors .    among the new cherenkov telescopes , magic",
    "@xcite is best suited for the detection of the prompt emission of grbs , due to its low energy threshold , large effective area , and , in particular , its capability for fast slewing @xcite .",
    "the low trigger threshold , currently @xmath5 at zenith , should allow the observation of grbs even at large redshift , as lower energy radiation can effectively reach the earth without interacting much with the mrf .",
    "moreover , in its fast slewing mode , magic can be repositioned in @xmath6 to any position on the sky : in case of a _ target of opportunity _",
    "alert by gcn , an automated procedure takes only few seconds to terminate any pending observation , validate the incoming signal and start slewing toward the grb position . extrapolating batse",
    "observed grb spectra to vhe with an unbroken power - law of power index from the batse catalogue , magic is predicted to detect about one grb per year at a @xmath7 level @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the analysis of data collected on grb050713a during its prompt emission phase and for the following 37 minutes .",
    "on 2005 july 13 at 4:29:02  ut the bat instrument on board swift detected a burst located at ra  @xmath8 dec  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the magic alert system received and validated the alert 12  s after the burst , and data taking started 40  s after the burst original time @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the burst was classified by swift as a bright burst with a duration of @xmath11 .",
    "the brightest part of the kev emission occured within @xmath12  s , three smaller peaks followed at @xmath13  s , @xmath14  s and @xmath15  s , while a _ pre - burst _ peak took place at @xmath16  s. ( see figure  [ fig_ratesswift ] ) . the spectrum , over the interval from @xmath17  s to @xmath18  s , can be fitted with a power - law with photon index @xmath19 and yields a fluence of @xmath20 in the @xmath21 range @xcite .",
    "the burst triggered also konus - wind @xcite , which measured the spectrum of the burst during the first 16  s , that is the duration of the first big peak as reported by swift .",
    "in the local coordinate system of magic , grb050713a was located at an azimuth angle of @xmath22 ( near north ) and a zenith angle of @xmath23 .",
    "the sky region of the burst was observed for @xmath24 , until twilight ( on data ) . between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "data taking was interrupted for technical reasons . a total amount of 258250 atmospheric showers , mainly background , were recorded . in order to evaluate the contamination of background in the data ,",
    "the grb position was observed again 48  hours later ( the so - called _ off data _ ) .",
    "data were analyzed using the magic standard software @xcite .",
    "for optimizing @xmath1/hadron separation , we simulated @xmath27 @xmath1 events with zenith angle ranging between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , energy greater than @xmath30 and an energy distribution following a power - law spectrum of index @xmath31 .",
    "this sample was analyzed in the same way as the data , and was used for the calculation of the collection area , the sensitivity , and for the energy estimation .",
    "after applying all selection criteria , the sample peaked at around @xmath32 , which we define as our telescope threshold at this zenith angle .",
    "data are processed using the standard hillas analysis @xcite .",
    "gamma / hadron separation is performed by means of _ random forest _",
    "( rf)@xcite , a classification method that combines several parameters describing the shape of the image into a new parameter called _ hadronness _ , the final @xmath1/hadron discriminator in our analysis .",
    "the simulated sample was used to optimise , as a function of energy , the cuts in hadronness .",
    "also the energy of the @xmath1 was estimated using a rf approach , yielding a resolution of @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter _ alpha _ of the hillas analysis , related with the direction of the incoming shower , is used to evaluate the significance of a signal . if the telescope is directed at a point - like @xmath1 source , as a grb is expected to be , the alpha distribution of collected photons should peak at @xmath35 , while it is uniform for isotropic background showers . according to simulations the @xmath1-signal at low energies may spread in a region defined conservatively by @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig_alpha ] shows the alpha distributions for the grb050713a and for off data , divided into three subsets of time covering 90  s , 5  min and 30  min , respectively .",
    "no evidence of excess in the signal region is seen .",
    "a second analysis searching for short time variable @xmath1-ray signals from grb050713a has been performed in the range @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig_rates ] shows the number of excess events during the first 37 minutes after the burst , in intervals of 20  s. the number of expected background events in the signal region ( open circles ) , estimated from the number of events in the region with @xmath38 , is constant indicating stable experimental condition .",
    "the number of excess events is stable and compatible with statistical fluctuations of the background .",
    "the same analysis was applied to the off data , with similar results .      analysing the data collected during the prompt emission of grb050713a between @xmath39  s and @xmath40  s",
    ", we can set upper limits on its flux at 95% confidence level ( see details in : * ? ? ?",
    "the upper limit can be used to constrain the prompt emission of the grb in the vhe range .",
    "since the observed spectrum is the convolution of the intrinsic spectrum and the mrf absorption , the limits on the former are thus necessarily model dependent .",
    "first of all , we assumed the grb spectrum extends to gev energies following the band function @xcite : after the energy break , estimated by konus - wind to be at @xmath41 , the flux follows a power - law of spectral index @xmath42 , the mean value of the batse distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this hypothesis , we calculated the upper limit on the average flux in our energy range during the entire 90  s interval .",
    "these values are summarised in table  [ tab_flux ] , and the lowest two energy bins are shown in figure  [ fig_flux ] , together with the spectrum measured at lower energies by swift and konus - wind .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that according to bat data , only @xmath43 of the total burst fluence in the @xmath44 region was released in the time window of the magic observations .",
    "this fraction of the flux is plotted in figure  [ fig_flux ] using a dashed line . adopting a semi - empirical model for the cosmologically evolving mrf @xcite",
    ", we derived unfolded flux upper limits for various redshift values as shown in table  [ tab_flux ] .",
    "magic was able to observe part of the prompt emission phase of a grb as a response to the alert system provided by the swift satellite .",
    "no excess above 175  gev was detected neither during the prompt emission phase nor during the following 37 minutes .",
    "we derived an upper limit to the @xmath1-ray flux between 175 and 1000  gev . the observation window covered by magic",
    "did not contain the first prominent peak detected at kev energies where the swift and konus - wind spectra were taken .",
    "upper limits are compatible with any nave extensions of the power - law spectrum up to hundreds of gev .    for the first time",
    "a cherenkov telescope is now able to perform direct observations of the prompt emission phase of grbs .",
    "although strong absorption of the high - energy @xmath1-ray flux by the mrf is expected at high redshifts , given its sensitivity to low fluxes and its fast slewing capabilities , the magic telescope is expected to detect about one grb per year , if the grb spectra extend to the hundreds of gev energy domain .",
    "the construction of the magic telescope was mainly made possible by the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn , and the spanish cicyt , to whom goes our grateful acknowledgement .",
    "we are grateful for all the hard work done by the gcn team , especially dr .",
    "scott barthelmy , and to all the people of the swift science center who kindly provided us with data , and tools to analyse them .",
