    "lovelock gravity is the most natural extension of general relativity ( gr ) in dimension higher than four , as it retains the basic character of the theory the equation of motion remains second order despite the action being higher order in riemann curvature .",
    "no other purely gravitational theory preserves this crucial feature .",
    "yet another interesting feature of gr is the fact that it is _ kinematic _ in three dimensions and it turns dynamical in the next even dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 . in three dimensions",
    "the riemann curvature tensor can be written in terms of the ricci so that there exist no non - trivial vacuum solution .",
    "if we want this property to remain true as we go to higher odd dimensions there is a unique choice that corresponds to pure lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "the action reduces in this case to a single @xmath0th order lovelock term , with or without cosmological constant in dimensions @xmath4 .",
    "this is the maximal order term in the lovelock series , higher order terms being either topological or zero .",
    "there is no sum over lower order terms and in particular there is no einstein term in the action .",
    "it is possible to define an analogue of the riemann tensor for @xmath0th order lovelock gravity , its characterizing property being that the trace of its bianchi derivative vanishes , yielding the corresponding divergence free analogue of the einstein tensor @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the same as the one obtained from the variation of the @xmath0th order lovelock action term . for the appropriate definition of lovelock - riemann tensor and zero cosmological constant , any pure lovelock vacuum in odd @xmath5 dimensions",
    "is lovelock flat , _",
    "i.e. _ any vacuum solution of the theory has vanishing lovelock - riemann tensor @xcite . likewise , even for non - zero cosmological constant , the weyl curvature vanishes in @xmath6 dimensions , and so does the lovelock - weyl tensor for pure lovelock in all odd @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "that is , pure lovelock gravity is _ kinematic _ relative to the lovelock analogue of the riemann tensor in all odd @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "kinematicity of pure lovelock gravity was shown to be true for static spacetimes @xcite and conjectured to hold in general .",
    "this has indeed been proven in general recently @xcite using a different definition for the lovelock - riemann tensor due to kastor @xcite .",
    "using purely algebraic properties , it has been shown that this @xmath0th order lovelock - riemann tensor can be entirely written in terms of the corresponding lovelock - ricci in odd @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "this clearly establishes kinematicity of pure lovelock gravity , as defined above , in all generality .",
    "there is no other gravity theory satisfying this property .",
    "furthermore , for kinematicity to hold in all odd dimensions we should restrict the pure lovelock equation to two dimensionalities only , @xmath7 , else this property would be violated .",
    "that is , for any given lovelock order , @xmath0 , the pertinent dimensions are only these two",
    ". we will be always referring to them when mentioning odd and even dimensions in the text .",
    "conversely for a given dimension , @xmath8 , the order is fixed as @xmath9 $ ] . henceforth by pure @xmath0th lovelock",
    "we would refer to this theory in those only two relevant dimensionalities , @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we focus on kasner - type metrics in pure lovelock gravity .",
    "these give a very interesting class of cosmological solutions , which are in fact the simplest instances of homogeneous but anisotropic spaces , and have been very effectively employed for studying the approach to the big - bang singularity @xcite . in the general relativistic case in four dimensions ,",
    "the approach to the singularity oscillates between several kasner - like phases , contracting along two axes and expanding along the third , followed by a switch over to a different expanding direction , and so on .",
    "the subsequent phases and the transitions between them can be represented as a map from the space of kasner solutions to itself , the _ kasner map _ , that has a very nice geometric structure . in the higher dimensional setting , while considering general lovelock gravity , the leading order behavior close to the singularity is captured by the highest order term , thus pure lovelock gravity would describe the relevant gravitational dynamics in the approach to the big - bang singularity within the full lovelock family of theories .",
    "the kasner metrics were also very instrumental in finding the right definition of lovelock - riemann tensor verifying kinematicity @xcite . for pure lovelock",
    "static vacuum spacetimes in @xmath2 both definitions of lovelock - riemann tensors due to dadhich @xcite and kastor @xcite vanish and the difference became apparent only while studying solutions of reduced symmetry .",
    "in fact , pure lovelock kasner metrics in odd dimensions have zero lovelock - riemann in kastor s formulation whereas dadhich s analogue is in general non - zero .    in the following sections we will analyze pure lovelock equations for vacuum and perfect fluid spacetimes and obtain solutions in the kasner class . in sections ii and iii",
    ", we set up the lovelock framework and write the equation of motion for kasner spaces .",
    "isotropy of spatial stresses is required for both vacuum and perfect fluid solutions .",
    "these conditions are solved in section iv , finding several classes of solutions or isotropy types .",
    "sections v and vi follow with a detailed analysis of perfect fluid and vacuum solutions respectively .",
    "for each of the vacuum families of solutions , we compute higher order curvature tensors that will allow us to actually distinguish between the different families .",
    "kastor s and dadhich s lovelock - riemann tensors provide an efficient characterization of the solutions .",
    "finally , in section vii we consider a family of exponential solutions , very closely related to the kasner class , and we conclude with a discussion . in the appendix",
    "we entertain the possibility of considering kasner - type solutions with complex exponents . even though in some cases the metric can still be brought to real form , these spaces contain closed timelike curves and thus can not be considered as viable solutions of any gravitational theory .",
    "the action of lovelock gravity and the corresponding equation of motion are given by a sum of homogeneous polynomial terms in the riemann curvature , each of them multiplied by a coupling @xmath10 with length dimension @xmath11 relative to the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "action and equations for these theories are most simply written in terms of differential forms @xmath12 in this language , the torsion and curvature forms are defined via cartan s structure equations , @xmath13 for which we have introduced a covariant exterior derivative , @xmath14 , with the corresponding connection 1-form @xmath15 , in addition to the usual exterior operator @xmath8 . in order to make contact with the usual tensorial formulation one imposes that the torsion is zero and solves for the spin connection in terms of the vielbein .",
    "the equation of motion above is obtained upon variation with respect to the vielbein only , leaving the spin connection unchanged , as the spin connection variation is proportional to the torsion , therefore set to zero .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce a set of @xmath16-rank tensors @xcite product of @xmath17 riemann tensors , completely antisymmetric , both in its upper and lower indices , @xmath18}_{\\qquad \\qquad a_{2k-1 } a_{2k}]}~. \\label{kastensor}\\ ] ] with all indices lowered , this tensor is also symmetric under the exchange of both groups of indices , @xmath19 . in a similar way we will denote the contractions of @xmath20 simply as @xmath21 in terms of these new objects",
    "we can now write @xmath22 in any of the formulations , this reduces to the usual einstein - hilbert action ( @xmath23 ) for @xmath3 with the first non - trivial @xmath24 gauss - bonnet ( gb ) correction appearing in five or higher dimensions .",
    "note that the @xmath0th order term in the action gives a non - trivial contribution to the equations only for @xmath25 .",
    "the gb contribution to the action can be written @xmath26    varying this term with respect to the metric tensor @xmath27 ( equivalently the vielbein ) , we obtain @xmath28 the gb analogue of the einstein tensor .    for reasons that will become clear later , we will be concerned here with the case of pure lovelock theories . for any given dimensionality @xmath2 or @xmath29 , we will consider the maximal degree @xmath0th order term as the only one in the lovelock series , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    this particular class of theories has some special properties not shared by any other lovelock theory .",
    "notice that it includes einstein gravity in three and four dimensions .",
    "in fact , pure lovelock theories will preserve some features of @xmath33 general relativity that are not respected by higher dimensional einstein s theory @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , in dimension three the riemann tensor can be written in terms of the ricci , in such a way that ricci flat solutions are actually completely flat , they have zero riemann . in dimension four",
    "this does not happen and the weyl tensor is in general non - zero .",
    "pure lovelock gravities as described above generalize this property to any dimension , as it is easy to show . in odd @xmath2 dimensions",
    "the ( @xmath34)-rank tensor defined previously can be written completely in terms of the lovelock - ricci @xmath35 ( or the corresponding einstein ) , @xmath36 which clearly shows that it vanishes when the corresponding einstein tensor vanishes . however for even dimensionality , @xmath29 , the above expression is not valid .",
    "the analogous would not vanish because it expression involves the ( @xmath37th rank ) lovelock - riemann , @xmath38 .",
    "this proves in general , without any reference to any particular solution , that pure lovelock gravity is _ kinematic _ in all odd @xmath2 dimensions . in case of non - zero cosmological",
    "constant , it can be easily verified that the lovelock - weyl tensor , the traceless part of @xmath38 , vanishes as is the case for the usual weyl in three dimensional einstein gravity .    in all relevant odd or even dimensions the whole information about the @xmath39-rank tensor is contained in @xmath38",
    "so we will be referring to this quantity only for all practical purposes .",
    "we will be comparing the results obtained for this lovelock - riemann tensor with those of other 4th rank tensors defined below .",
    "in particular for @xmath24 we may define two @xmath37th rank tensors ( see @xcite for details and definitions for any @xmath0 ) @xmath40}{}_{\\mu\\chi\\gamma}+r r^{\\alpha\\beta}{}_{\\chi\\gamma}\\ ] ] and @xmath41}{}_\\mu - r^{[\\alpha}{}_{[\\chi}r^{\\beta]}{}_{\\gamma]}+ r_{\\mu[\\chi\\nu}{}^{[\\alpha}r^{\\beta]\\mu}{}_{\\gamma]}{}^\\nu\\ ] ] related to the first of these objects , one of us @xcite defined an alternative lovelock - riemann analogue    @xmath42}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the complete contraction of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "kastor s lovelock - riemann @xcite , in turn , can be simply written as @xmath46 in sec .",
    "vi , it would be shown that for a particular class of pure gb vacuum solutions in odd @xmath47 , @xmath48 would be be non - zero while @xmath49 would be actually vanishing .",
    "consider a @xmath8-dimensional metric with flat @xmath50 slices , for which each of the @xmath51 spatial directions scales differently with time in a polynomial fashion , @xmath52 this is known as the kasner metric and is a homogeneous but anisotropic space .",
    "these type of metrics were also considered long ago by deruelle @xcite in the gb case ( see also @xcite for a more general account of anisotropic models in lovelock theories ) .    for this class of metrics",
    ", each additional power of the riemann curvature adds a factor @xmath53 to the lovelock - riemann tensor and the strength of singularity increases accordingly with the lovelock order . focusing in the dynamics near the big - bang singularity located at @xmath54",
    ", this means that the dominant contribution will come from the highest order lovelock term in the action .",
    "therefore , pure lovelock theories capture the leading order behavior in this regime .",
    "in fact , kasner metrics , as written above , will not , in general , be exact solutions of the equations of motion when considering terms of different curvature order in the action . if we want to analyze the subleading behaviour of the metric we may keep the next lower order lovelock term and expand the metric further with two polynomial terms in time , @xmath55 .",
    "lower lovelock terms become relevant for sufficiently long times ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath56 .",
    "since for pure lovelock the relevant dimensions are only two @xmath7 we would therefore be considering the corresponding cases , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively for odd and even dimensions . in what follows ,",
    "we write the lovelock - einstein tensor , @xmath59 , corresponding to the @xmath0th order lovelock term , for the metric ( [ kasner ] ) for odd and even dimensions .",
    "just the diagonal components are non - zero .    for odd @xmath2 dimensionality , there are @xmath60 exponents @xmath61 and the spatial components of the lovelock - einstein tensor are @xmath62 whereas the time component yields @xmath63 note that @xmath64 does not involve @xmath61 ; _",
    "i.e _ there are only @xmath65 exponents @xmath66 , in the last product or the sum .",
    "in particular , for @xmath47 gb these expressions reduce to @xmath67 and @xmath68    in even @xmath29 dimensions the expressions are similar , yet a bit more involved , @xmath69 the number of @xmath70 in each product term in the sum is @xmath65 , and there are @xmath71 such terms . besides , the time component reads @xmath72 for which each term in the sum is a product of @xmath60 exponents @xmath61 .",
    "each product involves a combination of all the @xmath73 @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e _ there are @xmath74 terms .    for gb in @xmath75 we may write @xmath76\\ ] ] and @xmath77",
    "even though kasner spacetimes are anisotropic in general , in many situations we are interested in the isotropic case for which all the spatial components of the lovelock - einstein tensor are equal . this is the case for vacuum or perfect fluid solutions that will be the focus of our analysis in the following sections .",
    "we shall therefore analyze the isotropy conditions @xmath78 for every pair @xmath79 .",
    "not all equations written in this way are independent , only @xmath80 are , and we can choose , for instance , a set with fixed @xmath81 or @xmath82 , say @xmath83 .      for odd dimensionality these conditions read @xmath84",
    "in particular fr five dimensional pure gb , it would reduce to @xmath85 and two similar equations for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .      in turn ,",
    "in even dimensions we find @xmath88 where each product in the sum contains @xmath89 different @xmath90 that are a combination of all @xmath91 available exponents with @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ there are @xmath93 of those terms .    in six dimensions , @xmath24 ,",
    "we shall write @xmath94 and three similar equations for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath95      there are several ways of solving the isotropy conditions . in both odd and even dimensions",
    "these reduce to a product of three factors . therefore , for each pair",
    "@xmath79 at least one of those factors must vanish . depending on the choice of the vanishing factors we will have several families of solutions or _",
    "isotropy types_.    * the first family type * ( a)* corresponds to the trivial solution @xmath96 for every @xmath79 , _ i.e. _ all the exponents are equal and the metric trivially isotropic . * another very simple solution type * ( b)* corresponds to putting to zero the second factor , that in fact does not depend on the pair @xmath79 that we pick , @xmath97 a single condition ensures isotropy in this case .",
    "whereas * ( a ) * type solutions form a one parameter family of metrics , * ( b ) * type spaces form a @xmath80 parameter family of solutions . * if we choose to set the third factor of the isotropy conditions to zero instead type * ( c)* , for every pair @xmath98 we get different conditions in odd and even dimensions . in odd @xmath2",
    "we have to solve @xmath99 whereas in even @xmath29 dimensions the condition is @xmath100 the form of the solutions is similar though . as we will see below , in odd @xmath2",
    "this istropy type implies that two exponents vanish , say @xmath101 , whereas in even @xmath29 three exponents have to vanish , @xmath102 for instance . in both cases ,",
    "these solutions correspond to vacuum spacetimes and will be considered in detail in section vi . in the @xmath23 case with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and hence these conditions become vacuous .",
    "there are no solutions in this class for einstein - hilbert gravity . *",
    "the last possibility type * ( d)* is to combine isotropy types * ( a ) * and * ( c ) * in such a way that for some pairs @xmath79 we have @xmath96 , whereas for others the third factor in the corresponding isotropy condition is the one that vanishes . as we will see below ,",
    "this will only be possible in even @xmath29 dimensions .",
    "isotropy types * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * are simple enough and do not require any more explanation . let us discuss type * ( c ) * and * ( d ) * in more detail . in odd dimensions enforcing just one of type * ( c )",
    "* conditions readily implies that one of the exponents vanishes , say @xmath105 .",
    "automatically all the components of the lovelock - einstein tensor vanish except for @xmath106 , but isotropy implies that the remaining component must also vanish , and hence another @xmath107",
    ". the rest of the exponents may take any value . to be more concrete",
    "let us focus for a moment in @xmath47 pure gb gravity , for which ( [ oddc ] ) reds , say for @xmath83 , @xmath108 this implies that two of the @xmath61 exponents with @xmath109 must be zero .",
    "all the components of the lovelock - einstein tensor vanish in that case , therefore all solutions in this isotropy type are vacuum spacetimes .",
    "this is also true in general , that is , isotropy type * ( c ) * in all odd @xmath2 dimensions implies vacuum spacetime .",
    "we will comment more on this later on .",
    "the even dimensional counterpart of the above statement is a bit more complicated to get . for @xmath75 pure gb",
    "again , we have for @xmath83 , @xmath110 this implies that three of @xmath61 must be zero .",
    "note that , if we set one of @xmath61 to zero , say , @xmath105 , then the isotropy conditions would read as @xmath111 up to a factor @xmath112 that we asume to be non - zero .",
    "otherwise the solution would already be considered in the type * ( b ) * class . from the previous equations it is now obvious that two more @xmath61 s are zero .",
    "again , this would lead to vacuum solutions which will be analyzed further in the corresponding section .    for general @xmath0 , imposing the above condition",
    "( [ evenc ] ) just for one pair @xmath79 implies either two @xmath113 exponents are zero , for instance @xmath101 , or else @xmath114 in the first case , @xmath101 , all components of @xmath115 but @xmath116 yield zero .",
    "furthermore , isotropy requires the rest must also vanish which implies one more @xmath117 and we have again a vacuum solution .",
    "the other possibility @xmath118 , tacitly assumes that none of the exponents involved @xmath119 is zero .",
    "however , when considering another pair such that @xmath120 , the only way @xmath121 is that at least one @xmath122 , thus contradicting the initial assumption .",
    "the only remaining possibility is that all @xmath123 s are organized in two groups such that either @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "this corresponds to isotropy type * ( d ) * and we just have to impose one restriction @xmath126 the rest of the isotropy conditions are either equivalent to this one or trivial . for @xmath127 having multiplicities",
    "@xmath128 with @xmath129 , this reduces to @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "for @xmath75 gb gravity , we have for instance @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and it is easy to check that the isotropy condition @xmath116 is verified .",
    "once the isotropy conditions are imposed the equation of motion coupled to matter has the form @xmath135 , which matches precisely the form of the stress - energy tensor of a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath136 and pressure @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , all components of the lovelock - einstein tensor @xmath115 scale as @xmath138 with time , and consequently the same behavior applies to the fluid @xmath139 and @xmath140 supporting these geometries .",
    "energy and pressure are , in this way , proportional to each other and satisfy a linear barotropic equation of state of the form , @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "we have density and pressure as given by    @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath7 respectively for odd and even dimensions .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath145 which gives for @xmath146 dust , radiation and stiff fluid respectively .",
    "it is an frw flat model .",
    "note that the @xmath64 component is free of @xmath61 .",
    "we can however substitute in eqs ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) @xmath148 so that in both cases @xmath64 has the same form of @xmath149 except for a numerical factor .",
    "thus , upon substitution , all spatial stresses become equal , and it turns out that @xmath150 for both odd and even dimensions .      as explained before this isotropy type corresponds to two and three zero exponents in odd and even dimensions respectively .",
    "this , as already mentioned , are vacuum solutions and thus have vanishing energy density and pressure , @xmath152 .      for the isotropy condition * ( c ) * ,",

    "vacuum spacetimes can be considered as a subset of the more general perfect fluid class of solutions from previous section .",

    "we may have two flat directions , say @xmath101 , or @xmath180 this can be combined with the different isotropy types to give three different families of solutions .",
    "the first two families are analogous to those found in the odd dimensional case and correspond to having at least two zero exponents . for type * ( b ) * metrics we have are all equal to one . for @xmath103 in einstein gravity this is actually the only solution in this class . ]",

    "type * ( c ) * metrics have at least @xmath151 flat directions , thus two and three in odd and even dimensions respectively , whereas type * ( b ) * solutions have at most @xmath196 vanishing @xmath61 . in odd dimensions",
    "these have one flat direction but in even dimensions they may have either two or none , corresponding to subtypes * ( b.1 ) * and * ( b.2)*. lovelock non - flat vacua emerge only in even @xmath29 dimensions only when all exponents @xmath61s are non - zero , these satisfying the conditions @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "this is true for any pure lovelock theory in vacuum .",
    "parallely , we analyzed the values the different lovelock - riemann analogue tensors take for the different vacuum types .",
    "we found a nice correspondence between the different families of solutions and the vanishing of particular sets of these 4th rank tensors , in a hierarchical way .",
    "type * ( a ) * solutions verify @xmath199 , type * ( c ) * have @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( except for _ flat kasner _ that has @xmath194 ) , while type * ( b.1 ) * or just * ( b ) * in odd dimensions yields @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( except for the solutions with all non - zero exponents equal to unity ) . finally type * ( b.2 ) * solutions are the ones for which all these tensors are non - vanishing .",
    "we can then use this tensors to classify our solutions in the different families , taking into account the exceptions",
    ". this may be very helpful in classifying solutions in case these are not given in the canonical kasner form , but in some other possibly complicated set of coordinates .",
    "besides , this classification scheme may be relevant for more general classes of solutions .",
    "a similar classification scheme exists for another class of solutions closely related to kasner .",
    "exponential type metrics as those studied in section vii , are also divided in isotropy types as kasner s and the relation to the vanishing of the different sets of tensors carries over , in this case without exceptions .",
    "the * ( b.2 ) , ( b.1 ) , ( c ) , ( a ) * types can be defined precisely setting to zero one further 4-tensor at a time ; @xmath202 , @xmath200 , @xmath199 .    in four dimensional einstein gravity ( @xmath23 pure lovelock ) we can analyze much more general cosmological models .",
    "these have been classified long ago by bianchi .",
    "kasner metrics correspond to the bianchi type i models in this classification , and represent the asymptotic solutions within those models .",
    "the situation is much more complicated for more general models , yet kasner solutions still play a preeminent role .",
    "bianchi type ii models turn out to have kasner asymptotics both to the past and the future .",
    "the kasner solutions connected through a bianchi type ii trajectory define the so called _ kasner map_. for more general models , the bkl conjecture proposed that the universe close to the initial singularity undergoes a series of oscillations , transitions between kasner epochs where the expanding and contracting directions exchange their roles . a precise realization of this conjecture is given by the _ mixmaster universe_. this represents the asymptotic behavior of bianchi types vii and xi and is given by the iteration of the kasner map , giving in this way the sequence of kasner epochs .",
    "this sequence is infinite in four dimensions and the dynamics has been shown to be chaotic @xcite .",
    "this chaotic behavior disappears in higher dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "non - trivial kasner metrics in four dimensions correspond to type * ( b ) * solutions in our classification ( type * ( b.1 ) * are just _ flat kasner _ in that case ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a similar behavior to that of the mixmaster attractor may also appear for other even dimensional pure lovelock theories .",
    "it would be one more feature of @xmath3 einstein gravity respected by pure lovelock theories in all dimensions .",
    "our classification could also be regarded as the necessary first step in such more general analysis .",
    "the obvious next step would be trying to generalize a result analogous to that of bianchi type ii in four dimensions and define a _",
    "generalized kasner map_. for that we would have to introduce curvature in the spatial slices of our model ( equivalently a nontrivial lie group structure ) .",
    "the analogue of bianchi ii models would be a deformation in just a given 3-dimensional subspace ; _ i.e. _ @xmath204 with @xmath205 and @xmath206=n(t ) e^3\\ ] ] in the usual notation , the rest of the commutation relations being zero .",
    "this is the simplest possible modification of the lie group structure .",
    "if a structure such as that of the kasner map exists also in this case , this could also provide new examples of chaotic maps , interesting objects in their own right . the rich geometric structure we have found in the space of type",
    "* ( b ) * solutions would perhaps come in handy in performing such analysis .",
    "the kasner type metrics that are the subject of this paper are solutions of pure lovelock gravity independently of the signature considered .",
    "the discussion of the next paragraphs will involve just the form of the metric and not the details of the equations , in that respect all that is said in this section applies also to einstein gravity on any dimension .",
    "the choice of signature used in the previous sections corresponds to the description of the near region to a spacelike singularity .",
    "we can also describe timelike singularities in a similar fashion , we just have to exchange the roles of the time and one of the spacelike coordinates , @xmath207 .",
    "the form of the solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ the possible values of the exponents is independent of the choice of signature , at least for real values of these exponents .",
    "formally one can also choose complex values for the @xmath61 , as soon as they verify the relevant algebraic equations .",
    "the simplest such case is that of a complex conjugate pair of exponents , the rest being real .",
    "this is also an option in 4d einstein gravity for which we can solve for two of the exponents in terms of the third as @xmath208 these are real for a small range of values of @xmath209 $ ] , otherwise they have an imaginary part and we can write @xmath210 , for real @xmath211 . notice that this is the range of values considered in the lifshitz - khalatnikov parametrization , @xmath212 with real parameter @xmath213 .",
    "even though @xmath213 may take any real value the exponents always belong to the range @xmath214 $ ] .",
    "starting with riemannian signature with a complex kasner metric of the form , @xmath215 the term in brackets of the above metric is complex , this being the reason complex kasner exponents have been disregarded in the past .",
    "we can however bring the metric to a real ( lorentzian ) form performing a _",
    "complex _ change of coordinates , @xmath216 .",
    "this yields , @xmath217 even though we started off with riemannian signature the presence of complex exponents already implies one timelike direction when the metric is written in real form .",
    "notice however that the direction of the timelike direction in the @xmath218 plane changes as we move along the radial direction @xmath219 ( see figure [ ctc ] , left ) .",
    "this makes a bit difficult to visualize the causal structure of this space and will determine some of its peculiar properties , namely the existence of closed timelike curves .",
    "have we considered more than two complex exponents we would end up with more than one timelike direction . in some situations it is not even possible to bring the metric to any real form .    for simplicity we will analyze the case @xmath220 in detail . for @xmath221",
    "some of the expressions will be a bit more complicated but the qualitative picture is still the same .",
    "we will consider just the @xmath222 part of the metric and neglect the conformal factor @xmath223 as it does not change the causal structure .",
    "equivalently , we consider @xmath224 we fix the future direction as that of positive @xmath225 at @xmath226 .",
    "this fixes the future direction for the rest of the space .",
    "it is orientable . for any @xmath227 plane",
    "it is easy to find the null lines as @xmath228 these are @xmath229 for @xmath226 and they rotate counterclockwise with constant opening as we increase @xmath219 ( see figure [ ctc ] ) .",
    "in addition to these , there is another family of null trajectories that is particularly simple to find . that is @xmath230 that is future directed for @xmath231 .",
    "we can also have a future directed null trajectory going to lower values of @xmath219 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath232 , just changing the overall sign of @xmath233 , @xmath234 where we added a constant such that both curves pass by @xmath235 .",
    "these two null curves coincide also for @xmath236 but they pass by these points in reversed order .",
    "the first curve is future directed from @xmath226 to @xmath237 whereas the second is future directed from @xmath237 to @xmath226 .",
    "we can then take these two pieces and construct a closed future directed null curve ( see figure [ ctc ] , right ) .",
    "this is the simplest case of such a curve , it is easy to work out many other examples . in the same way it is possible to demonstrate the existence of closed timelike curves ,",
    "the null case is just some limiting case that is easier to analyze .",
    "in fact it is enough to add some small timelike pieces in between the trajectories going in both directions .",
    "this is true independently of the values of the complex exponents ( equivalently @xmath238 and @xmath239 ) ."
