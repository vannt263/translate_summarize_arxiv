    "* and references therein ) , galaxy formation and evolution models have been challenged to explain the increase in size of these systems with decreasing redshift and the fact that similarly compact massive galaxies are almost completely absent from the local universe @xcite . compared to present - day galaxies of similar ( stellar ) mass ( @xmath4 ) , these high-@xmath5 compact galaxies or red nuggets are a factor of @xmath6 smaller ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) with half - light or effective radii @xmath7 kpc , while their stellar mass densities within the effective radius are on average an order of magnitude higher ( although this difference is smaller for the stellar mass densities within the central kiloparsec , see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". based on the low fraction of close pairs among quiescent galaxies observed at @xmath8 @xcite and the small number of near equal mass mergers produced in n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , it seems that major mergers can only be partly responsible for the observed size growth .",
    "additional secular processes , such as adiabatic expansion @xcite and/or a series of minor mergers @xcite , might be needed to expand these compact systems .",
    "recent deep , high - resolution images taken with the wide field camera ( wfc3 ) and nic2 camera on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have shown that based on observed elliptiticies and srsic profile fits , there may be indications that many of these compact high - redshift galaxies contain disks @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite claim based on their sample of 14 quiescent massive compact galaxies , that the majority of these systems are disk dominated . based on the structural parameters derived from ground - based imaging , @xcite have recently reported a small decrease in the average axial ratio with redshift ( i.e. , mildly increased prominence of the disk component ) for a sample of post - starburst galaxies found at @xmath8 .",
    "these findings would have interesting consequences for the possible formation and evolution scenarios of these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the present paper we investigate the claim in @xcite by comparing the ellipticity and srsic distributions of these objects to the corresponding distributions for nearby massive disk - dominated galaxies , as well as massive bulge - dominated early - type galaxies . to define our high - redshift sample we complement the @xcite sample with the @xcite synthesis of published structural data for high-@xmath5 compact galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts . at low redshift , we characterize the ellipticity and srsic index distributions of nearby galaxies using the local morphology sample recently published by @xcite .",
    "our sample of high - redshift massive compact galaxies consists of 14 galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath9 taken from @xcite , augmented by objects selected from the compendium published by @xcite .",
    "all 69 galaxies in the damjanov et al . sample have spectroscopic redshifts , hst - based images and published ellipticities and srsic indices .",
    "around 1/4 of these galaxies are at @xmath9 , have stellar masses @xmath10 , and are compact ( @xmath11 kpc ) and quiescent ( not actively forming stars ) .",
    "these 17 objects are added to our high - redshift sample , resulting in a total sample size of 31 galaxies .",
    "galaxies in the damjanov et al .",
    "sample span a mass range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , with a median of @xmath14 .",
    "galaxies in the @xcite sample all have stellar masses larger than @xmath14 , with a median of @xmath15 when scaled to a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function to be consistent with the damjanov et al . sample .",
    "the two samples therefore include objects with similar stellar masses and in the same redshift range , and all have @xmath11 kpc .",
    "our local galaxy sample is selected from the morphological catalog recently published by @xcite .",
    "this catalog is based on two - dimensional structural fits ( srsic bulge@xmath16 exponential disk decompositions , as well as single srsic fits ) in the _ g _ and _ r _ bandpasses for 1.12 million local galaxies taken from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "we restrict our comparison to galaxies with redshifts @xmath17 in order to minimize the impact of seeing on the observed shapes . as described in @xcite , a robust sample of early - type galaxies",
    "can be selected from this parent catalog by requiring that galaxies have a bulge fraction @xmath18 and an image smoothness @xmath19 . imposing these cuts results in a sample of @xmath20 early - type galaxies , which defines our local early - type galaxy parent sample .",
    "our local disk - dominated sample was chosen solely based on bulge - to - total ratio , with @xmath21 .",
    "stellar masses , @xmath22 , were estimated using the approximation presented by @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are rest - frame absolute magnitudes in _ g-_band and _ r-_band , respectively , and @xmath26 is the g - band absolute magnitude of the sun . a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) was assumed in deriving this relation .",
    "the relative masses determined using this formula are likely to be accurate to 0.1 dex over the redshift range of our local sample @xcite .",
    "fair comparisons between the high - redshift and low - redshift samples require careful matching of the mass ranges of the samples , and most of the comparisons in this paper will be based on mass - selected subsets of our local galaxy sample .",
    "note that our selection of our local samples is based on morphology only , and does not put any restrictions on star formation activity or quiescence .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the apparent ellipticity distributions for our high - redshift massive compact galaxy sample .",
    "the ellipticity is as usual defined as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the observed axis ratio of the images , such that round galaxies have @xmath29 .",
    "these ellipticities ( and also the srsic indices that we introduce below ) have been measured on the total galaxy image using the two - dimensional fitting routine gim2d , so prior to bulge - disk decomposition @xcite . in the left - hand panel ,",
    "ellipticity distributions for our local early - type galaxy samples have been superposed on the high - redshift distribution .",
    "the local early - type galaxies samples consist of objects with stellar masses @xmath30 ( solid red line ) and early - type galaxies with stellar masses @xmath31 ( dotted purple line ) .",
    "the @xmath32 curve provides the most meaningful comparison to the compact massive galaxies sample , but both local galaxy distributions are shown in order to illustrate the robustness of our conclusions to small ( 0.2 dex ) variations in the mass threshold . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test was used to determine whether the low - redshift distributions differ significantly from the high - redshift distribution , and the corresponding @xmath33-values from the test are shown as labels in the figure .",
    "the high - redshift and local early - type galaxy ellipticity distributions differ at a less than 1@xmath34 level and are therefore statistically indistinguishable .",
    "our conclusion remains the same if we choose a more conservative cut ( @xmath35 ) in defining our local early - type galaxy sample ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath10 and @xmath38 respectively ) .",
    "although the high and low - redshift ellipticity distributions presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] appear consistent , the small number of galaxies included in the high-@xmath5 sample raises the question whether there are any distributions at all that could be ruled out using such a small sample .",
    "it is thus rather interesting to show that one distribution that can clearly be eliminated is that of local disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "the right - hand plot in figure  [ fig1 ] shows the results of k - s tests comparing our sample of 31 high - redshift massive compact galaxies to the ellipticity distributions of similarly massive disk - dominated ( @xmath39 ) galaxies from our local sample . the ellipticity distribution for this local population decreases for @xmath40 , indicative of earlier findings that local disks are not intrinsically circular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is only a @xmath41 probability that the high and low - redshift ellipticity distributions are drawn from the same population . for a more conservative cut ( @xmath42 )",
    ", this probability drops to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , on the basis of ellipticity distributions alone , one is driven to conclude that the population of compact objects is dominated by early - type galaxies .",
    "our conclusion remains unchanged if we select from our local samples only those galaxies that have effective widths ( ew ) of the [ oii ] line less than 5 , indicating a quiescent ( non - star forming ) nature . for local massive ( @xmath44 ) quiescent early - type galaxies , @xmath45 , while for the local massive quiescent disk galaxies , the probability that they come from the same distribution as the high - redshift compacts stays low at @xmath46 .",
    "however , is the same conclusion reached when other structural data are also considered ?    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have compared the observed ellipticity distribution of massive , compact , quiescent galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath47 ) to those of local ( @xmath48 ) early - type galaxies , and conclude that the two distributions are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "in addition , we show that the ellipticity distribution of our high-@xmath5 sample is inconsistent with that of a local massive disk - dominated sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the srsic index distributions of compact high-@xmath5 galaxies and local early - type galaxies are not consistent , and the srsic index distribution of local disk galaxy samples provides a better match to the high-@xmath5 data .",
    "we conclude that either ( a ) high-@xmath5 galaxies are a composite population of disks and bulges ( which presents the troublesome possibility that galaxy sizes are growing for all structural types ) ; or else , ( b ) that the shapes and light profiles of high - redshift massive compact galaxies are unlike those of any local galaxy sample , and their structure changes over time . in the latter case , these objects constitute a new class of galaxies on their own ."
