    "quadratic gravitational lagrangians were proposed shortly after the formulation of general relativity ( gr ) as alternatives to einstein s theory .",
    "gravity modifications in the form of higher - order curvature invariants in the lagrangian are generally known as higher - order gravity ( hog ) theories .",
    "they arise in string - theoretic considerations , e.g. , brane models with gauss - bonett terms @xcite or models with a scalar field coupled to the gauss - bonett invariant @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) and generally involve linear combinations of all possible second order invariants that can be formed from the riemann , ricci and scalar curvatures . a quarter of a century ago there was a resurgence of interest in such theories in an effort to explain inflation .",
    "the reasons for considering hog theories were multiple .",
    "firstly , it was hoped that higher order lagrangians would create a first approximation to quantum gravity , due to their better renormalisation properties than gr @xcite .",
    "secondly , it was reasonable to expect that on approach to a spacetime singularity , curvature invariants of all orders ought to play an important dynamical role .",
    "far from the singularity , when higher order corrections become negligible , one should recover gr .",
    "furthermore , it was hoped that these generalized theories of gravity might exhibit better behavior near singularities .",
    "thirdly , inflation emerges in these theories in a most direct way . in one of the first inflationary models , proposed in 1980 by starobinsky @xcite , inflation is due to the @xmath0 correction term in a gravitational lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "recently there is a revival of interest in hog theories in an effort to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to add an @xmath3 term to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian or more generally to consider @xmath4 lagrangians @xcite .",
    "as the universe expands , one expects that the inverse curvature terms will dominate and produce the late time accelerating expansion .",
    "most studies are restricted to simple friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models because of the complexity of the field equations . at present , the observational viability of these models is a subject of active research ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it seems that a large class of lagrangians may fit the observational data , but simple models based on the frw metric are insufficient to pick the correct lagrangian ( see for example @xcite for the reconstruction of the @xmath5 theory which best reproduces the observed cosmological data ) . for more general spacetimes it may even be meaningless to say that @xmath6 is small in some epoch of cosmic evolution and large in some other one ( for a thorough critic see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the late time evolution of flat and positively curved frw models with a perfect fluid in the @xmath7 theory .",
    "this is the simplest generalization of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian and the addition of the quadratic term represents a correction to general relativity .",
    "the simple vacuum case was studied in @xcite , where oscillatory behaviour of the solutions of closed models was found . since hog theories in vacuum are conformally equivalent to gr with a scalar field , it is tempting to say that the @xmath0 contribution has predictable cosmological consequences @xcite .",
    "however , this  is an oversimplification of the picture ( see @xcite for specific examples ) .",
    "the two frames are mathematically equivalent , but physically they provide different theories . in the jordan frame , gravity is described entirely by the metric @xmath8 in the einstein frame , the scalar field exhibits a non - metric  aspect of the gravitational interaction , reflecting the additional degree of freedom due to the higher order of the field equations in the jordan frame .",
    "inclusion of additional matter fields , further complicates the situation and while the field equations in the einstein frame are formally the einstein equations , nevertheless this theory is not physically equivalent to gr .",
    "there is no universally acceptable answer to the issue which conformal frame is physical  @xcite ( see @xcite for a thorough analysis of different views ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "next section contains a short comment on the stability of well - known power - law solutions .",
    "the field equations are written as a constrained four - dimensional polynomial dynamical system .",
    "section 3 contains the analysis of the flat case .",
    "the so - called normal form of the dynamical system greatly simplifies the problem , since two of the equations decouple . in section 4",
    "we study the qualitative behaviour of the solutions near the equilibrium points of positively curved models and analyse their late time evolution .",
    "it is shown that an initially expanding closed frw universe may exhibit oscillatory behaviour .",
    "the general gravitational lagrangian in four - dimensional spacetimes contains curvature invariants of all orders , @xmath9 .",
    "the term @xmath10 is omitted because of the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "a further simplification can be done in homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes where the variation of @xmath11 with respect to the metric is proportional to the variation of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that for isotropic cosmologies the gravitational lagrangian contains only powers of the scalar curvature and we may consider hog theories derived from lagrangians of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary smooth function .",
    "it is well - known that the corresponding field equations are fourth - order and take the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and a prime ( @xmath16 ) denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath17 the generalised bianchi identities imply that @xmath18 contraction of ( [ hoge ] ) yields the trace equation @xmath19 in contrast to gr where the relation of @xmath6 to @xmath20 is algebraic , in hog theories the trace equation ( [ trace ] ) is a differential equation for @xmath21 with @xmath20 as source term @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in hog theories both the metric and the scalar curvature are dynamical fields .",
    "in the following , we consider a quadratic lagrangian without cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath22 and confine our attention to cosmologies with a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath23 and pressure @xmath24 of the form @xmath25 for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes is the scale factor , an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath26 and units have been chosen so that @xmath27 described by the standard frw metric we need the following useful relations ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) @xmath30 the @xmath31 component of ( [ hoge ] ) is @xmath32   = \\frac{1}{3}\\rho , \\label{0 - 0}%\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the hubble function .    at this point",
    "we make a digression . for flat , @xmath34 models , differentiating the relation @xmath35 ( which comes from the third of ( [ isot ] ) ) with respect to @xmath36 ,",
    "equation ( [ 0 - 0 ] ) takes the form@xmath37 for radiation , @xmath38 , there exists a special solution @xmath39 as @xmath40 as barrow and middleton point out @xcite , this is also an exact vacuum solution of the purely quadratic theory , in the sense that it solves @xmath41 however , this solution is unstable as we shall see in a moment ( see @xcite for a detailed stability analysis of isotropic models in general @xmath42 theories ) . following carroll et al @xcite ,",
    "we reduce the order of ( [ 00flat ] ) in vacuum by defining@xmath43 then , the asymptotic values of the function @xmath44 as @xmath45 correspond to the exponents @xmath46 for power - law solutions @xmath47 .",
    "we apply this technique to ( [ 00flat ] ) and we find the first - order equation@xmath48 with the corresponding direction field shown in fig .",
    "we see that the solution @xmath49 is a past attractor ( @xmath50 ) , but becomes unstable as @xmath45 in agreement with @xcite , and that @xmath51 corresponding to the singularity @xmath52 .",
    "this is also evident by studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the linearised equation near the constant solutions @xmath53 and @xmath54    ) ]    we now continue our discussion about the choice of variables . setting @xmath55",
    "the @xmath31 equation becomes @xmath56   = \\frac{1}{3}\\rho , \\label{00}%\\ ] ] and the evolution equation for @xmath57 is @xmath58 the evolution equation for @xmath59 comes from the third of ( [ isot ] ) and takes the form@xmath60 the conservation equation@xmath61 is a consequence of the bianchi identities . with the relation @xmath62 equation ( [ trace ] ) becomes @xmath63 this equation is usually considered as superfluous , since it follows from the differentiation of the equation ( [ 00 ] ) with respect to @xmath36 ; for example equation ( [ trac ] ) was used in @xcite as a control of the accuracy of numerical investigations of bianchi type i and ix models .",
    "thus , one can chose @xmath64and @xmath23 as dynamical variables which obey the evolution equations ( [ 00 ] ) , ( [ chi ] ) , ( [ hubb ] ) and ( [ cons ] ) and constitute a four - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "the form of equation ( [ 00 ] ) suggest the choice of expansion normalized variables of the type @xmath65 detailed studies using this approach for general @xmath42 theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , even in the simplest case of flat models in vacuum , numerical investigation of the system with initial values @xmath66 shows that @xmath67 exhibit damped oscillations , with almost zero minima .",
    "therefore although permissible , the transformation ( [ tran ] ) may induce fake singularities to the solutions .",
    "moreover , as mentioned in @xcite , a drawback of this choice of variables is that it does not give a complete description of the evolution for bouncing or recollapsing models .",
    "if the hubble parameter passes through zero the logarithmic time coordinate is ill - defined and the transformation ( [ tran ] ) is singular ( see @xcite for a comparison of compact and non - compact variables ) .    in order to circumvent these difficulties , we introduce one more degree of freedom by using ( [ trac ] ) , thus augmenting the dimension of the dynamical system .",
    "the state @xmath68 of the system lies on the hypersurface of @xmath69 defined by the constraint ( [ 00 ] ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath70 in the state vector reflects the fact that there are additional degrees of freedom in hog theories than in gr ( cf . the remark after equation ( [ trace ] ) ) .",
    "we define @xmath71 @xmath72 and use ( [ 00 ] ) to eliminate @xmath73 so that equations ( [ trac ] ) , ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ hubb ] ) constitute a four - dimensional system .",

    "* remark . *",
    "the system ( [ full ] ) is not an arbitrary free  four - dimensional system . in view of ( [ 00 ] ) the initial conditions have to satisfy the condition @xmath77 with a little manipulation of the equations ( [ full ] ) it can be shown that , once we start with initial conditions satisfying ( [ ineq ] ) at time @xmath78 , the solutions of the system satisfy this inequality for all @xmath79 thus the field equations share the general property of the einstein equations , namely that the subsequent evolution of the system is such that the solutions respect the constraint .",
    "in the flat , ( @xmath80 ) , case the dimension of the dynamical system is reduced by one , since the evolution equation for @xmath57 decouples from the remaining equations .",
    "the corresponding system is@xmath81 i.e. , the vector field does not depend on the dynamical variable @xmath82 vacuum models are significantly simpler to analyse , but we do not study them separately as they arise formally by setting @xmath38 in all the equations , while ( [ ineq ] ) describing the phase space becomes equality . the only equilibrium point of ( [ flat ] ) is the origin and corresponds to flat empty spacetime .",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix at the origin are @xmath83 and therefore we can not infer about stability using the linearisation theorem . for nonhyperbolic equilibrium points there exist no general methods for studying their stability",

    "the normal form theory is a powerful method for determining the qualitative behaviour of a dynamical system near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium point , but does not give any information about the structure of the solutions far from this equilibrium .",
    "our results are based on an analysis of the behaviour of the dynamical system ( [ full ] ) only near the equilibrium solutions .",
    "the geometry of the trajectories of a four - dimensional dynamical system may be quite complicated , e.g. strange attractors may be present . for the system ( [ full ] ) the whole picture may come in view only from the investigation of the global structure of the solutions .",
    "the study of this question is an interesting challenge for mathematical relativity .",
