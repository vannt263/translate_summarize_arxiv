    "the mapping of fermionic theories into bosonic ones is a very powerful technique used to understand nonperturbative aspects of quantum field theories .",
    "this so called bosonization is exact in two dimensional theories , and it has been widely employed in this dimension [ 1 - 3 ] . in the last few years , many papers have been devoted to the study of what has been called bosonization in three dimensions [ 4 - 8 ] , and even in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this kind of path - integral bosonization consists of obtaining the effective action by integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom and then studying the physical properties of the resulting effective theory . in most of the works along this line one",
    "makes use of the derivative expansion @xcite and derives weak bosonization rules for the system @xcite as well as the particle content and their masses @xcite . on the other hand in @xcite an exact , in @xmath1 , action at one - loop level",
    "is used to show that the bosonization of @xcite and @xcite , is recovered in the large and small momentum limits respectively .",
    "in addition , the authors of @xcite have studied the assymptotic properties of the bosonic effective action associated with qed in three dimensions , showing the screening property of the effective potential between two static charges .    in this work",
    "we apply the effective action approach of bosonization on qed in two and three dimensions .",
    "the usefulness of the two dimensional case lies on the fact that @xmath7 can be bosonized via the massive sine - gordon model which exhibits confinement @xcite .",
    "thus both approaches of bosonization can be compared . here",
    "we verify that , indeed the confining behavior also appears in the bosonization _ via _ effective action .",
    "it is remarkable that in two dimensions at the quadratic approximation in the gauge fields but without any expansion in @xmath1 , the massive pole of the schwinger model disappears , being replaced by a massless pole , which is in agreement with what has been observed in @xcite , but it differs from the result obtained through perturbative ( @xmath8 ) calculation of @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "it is shown that there is a massive excitation which depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we have found a simple approximated expression for this function .",
    "this in fact generalizes the calculations of @xcite , which were obtained at leading order of the derivative expansion , and that of @xcite carried out at a higher order in @xmath1 , which in its turn is related to consistent higher derivative actions @xcite .    in both cases",
    "we consider the one - loop effective action up to second - order in the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "we may write it as    @xmath11 { \\tilde{a}}_{\\nu}(k),\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the fourier transformation of @xmath13 and    @xmath14\\ ] ]    is the polarization tensor obtained after integrating out the fermion fields .",
    "the space - time dimension is represented by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is useful to expand the polarization tensor in powers of @xmath17 which corresponds to the derivative expansion of the effective action @xcite . truncating the expansion at some power of @xmath18 not only yields a local effective action but also allows one to analyse the rle of some specific term as it is the case of the leading odd - parity term in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is also important to study the phenomenological aspects of a low - energy effective action @xcite .",
    "the order at which the series is truncated depends on the range of energy one is interested in .",
    "recent studies of the contributions of higher - order derivative terms in a low - energy effective gauge theory revealed the possibility of the appearence of non - physical excitations .",
    "here we overcome this difficulty by analyzing directly the poles of the full propagator at one - loop level up to second order in the coupling constant .",
    "in @xmath20 the polarization tensor will be given by    @xmath21    where using , e. g. , dimensional regularisation we get    @xmath22 .\\ ] ]    we are interested in the interacting potential between two static charges @xmath23 and @xmath24 located at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "solving - vacuum ( @xmath27 ) ] the equation of motion derived from the effective action we obtain the potential produced by the positive charge @xmath28 : @xmath29    where    @xmath30    [ current ]    is the conserved current and @xmath31 is the  photon \" propagator",
    "whose longitudinal term is given by    @xmath32    due to the specific form of the external current the only contribution to the potential will be its time - component .",
    "the corresponding integral can be easily performed on the complex plane for arbitrary masses .",
    "the resulting static potential at @xmath33 grows linearly with the distance between the charges , namely    @xmath34 } l.\\ ] ]    then we conclude that , at the quadratic approximation used here , @xmath20 results in a _ confining _ potential . because of the quadratic approximation in the gauge fields we may say that the result obtained here , _",
    "i.e. _ , a linearly growing inter - fermion effective potential is due to a zero mass pole for the gauge potential .",
    "one also reaches a similar result in the usual bosonization approach when the quadratic approximation in the boson field of the massive sine - gordon model is used @xcite . in other words",
    "we can say that , at the quadratic approximation , turning on a mass for the fermion field will prevent the mass generation for the gauge boson and the classical result , that is a massless pole , prevails .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , since we are only interested in the real contribution to the effective action , we have dropped in ( 4 ) the imaginary part of the polarization tensor which appears beyond the pair creation threshold @xmath35 .",
    "more specifically , expression ( 4 ) is correct for @xmath36 which is the relevant region for the calculation of the effective potential of static charges due to the factor @xmath37 which comes from the time integral in ( 5 ) .",
    "however , for the analysis of the particle content of ( 1 ) we have also calculated the polarization tensor in the region @xmath38 where we found no poles except in the limit @xmath39 where we found an agreement with the limit @xmath40 of ( 4 ) .",
    "finally , it is important to notice that although we can recover the schwinger model effective action from the @xmath41 limit of ( 4 ) its static potential does not correspond to the massless limit of ( 8) since the integral and the limit do not commute with each other . in the schwinger model ( massless @xmath7 ) a mass for the gauge boson",
    "is generated by the gauge anomaly and as a consequence one obtains a _ screening _",
    "potential between two static charges @xcite .",
    "here we are not concerned with the explicit expression for the interaction potential but with the behavior of the mass generated dynamically as a function of the coupling constant and the fermion mass .    in this case",
    "the polarization tensor is given by    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    and    @xmath45 . \\label{pi2}\\ ] ]    equations ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) were obtained by using dimensional regularization method .",
    "equation ( [ pi1 ] ) is regularization dependent and our result corresponds to an equal number of pauli - villars regulators with positive and negative masses . like the two dimensional case ,",
    "since we are only interested in the real contribution to the effective action , we have dropped the imaginary part of the polarization tensor which appears beyond the pair creation threshold ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "more precisely we have only given the polarization tensor ( see ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) ) in the region @xmath38 where we found a pole in the photon propagator .",
    "for @xmath36 the correct result correspond to replace @xmath47 by @xmath48 in ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) where @xmath49 .",
    "the situation is similar to qed@xmath50 , see , e.g. , [ 26 ] .",
    "we have explicitly verified that no tachyonic poles appear without any approximation on @xmath51 . back to the region @xmath52 one can check that the  photon \" propagator    @xmath53 } g_{\\mu \\nu},\\ ] ]    where    @xmath54    develops a massive pole @xmath55 .",
    "the gauge boson mass @xmath56 depends on the coupling constant and fermion mass .",
    "we have carried out a numerical analysis for the behavior of this mass generated dynamically and found a very simple function , namely    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    from the numerical results for the massive pole at small @xmath59 we get @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , from the large @xmath59 region we have @xmath61 .",
    "finally the constant @xmath62 was adjusted by choosing the best fitting for a curve with about eleven thousand numerically calculated points , and it was found to be @xmath63 .",
    "the maximum error of the fitted function is less than @xmath64 , with the statistical controlling parameter @xmath65 . in the figure [ fig : figure1 ] we present the curve of the massive pole as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 .",
    "note that it is impossible to distinguish the exact from the adjusted curve in figure 1 . for this reason we present in the figure [ fig : figure2 ] the dependence of the percentual deviation of the fitted curve from the numerically obtained masses .    in reference",
    "@xcite the derivative expansion up to second - order in @xmath66 is used to compute the effective potential which was also found to be of the _ screening _ type .",
    "we have taken into account the whole expression for the polarization tensor and found only one massive pole in the whole range of the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "since the pole can never be found at the origin we conclude that , nonperturbatively in @xmath67 the screening effect prevails in agreement with the numerical analysis carried out in reference @xcite for the static potential .",
    "the truncation based on the derivative expansion only amounts to a displacement of the massive pole from its nonperturbative ( in @xmath1 ) value .",
