    "most of the dust is produced by low - mass stars ascending the agb .",
    "however , their long evolutionary main - sequence lifetime ( a few gyrs ) excludes them from being possible dust contributors at high redshift .",
    "conversely , very massive stars evolve much more rapidly ( time scales @xmath10 1 myr ) , and can be possible dust makers in the early universe . as to the first generation of stars , hereafter pop  iii stars , they are expected to be very massive ( omukai & nishi 1998 , abel et al 2002 , bromm et al .",
    "indeed in the absence of metals , the cooling in primordial clouds is only provided by molecular hydrogen and thus precludes efficient gas fractionation . these pop .",
    "iii stars firstly need to synthesize heavy elements by thermonuclear reactions in their cores and reach their explosive ends to possibly condense dust in their massive supernova ejecta . therefore , pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) are perhaps the first dust contributors to the pristine , young universe .",
    "the build - up of a molecular phase is a pre - requisite to dust nucleation and condensation .",
    "indeed , it provides the molecular precursors from which dust forms and its composition depends on the initial elemental composition of the gas and the physical processes pertaining to it .",
    "furthermore , molecules produced in the early universe can have an important effect on the cooling of the interstellar medium .",
    "molecules have been detected in low - redshift ccsne as early as 100 days post - explosion .",
    "specifically , the ir ro - vibrationals transitions of co and sio were detected in sn1987a ( catchpole & glass 1987 , meikle et al .",

    "iii star supernovae .",
    "existing models for co and sio formation in sn1987a ejecta only considered a limited number of chemical processes applicable to low - temperature gases and assumed that steady state held for chemistry in calculating the evolution of molecular masses ( petuchowski et al .",

    "since the amount of carbon and oxygen locked up in co is a major factor in determining the dust composition , toddini & ferrrara ( 2001 ) and sfs04 do consider the formation of co in fully microscopically - mixed ejecta .",
    "however , their treatment is extremely over - simplified as their co chemistry includes only two chemical processes and is assumed once again at steady state . in a first attempt to model molecular formation with a chemical kinetic approach in fully microscopically - mixed pop .",
    "iii sn ejecta , cherchneff & lilly ( 2008 ) ( herafter cl08 ) show that the chemistry does not reach a steady state over the timespan studied .",
    "furthermore , they identified other chemical processes than those considered by sfs04 that are of paramount importance to the formation of co and other molecular species in the ejecta .    in this paper , we study the formation and evolution of molecules , including gas - phase dust precursors , in the ejecta of pop  iii sne .",
    "we define a large set of chemical reactions relevant to the dense and hot sn environment but applicable to other circumstellar media as well .",
    "in addition to this extensive reaction network , with new updated rates compared to those used by cl08 , we include processes unique to the radioactive environment of sn ejecta : destructive processed induced by compton electrons created by the down - scattering of @xmath11-rays , and by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons emitted by collisionally - excited atoms and ions .",
    "we consider fully microscopically - mixed and unmixed ejecta for different progenitor masses .",
    "in addition , the presence of hydrogen and helium can dramatically affect the chemistry of the ejecta .",

    "we first give a brief overview of the mathematical formalism , followed by a detailed description of the non - thermal destructive processes that operate in a sn environment .",
    "the results of our calculations for mixed and unmixed ejecta of various mass progenitors are presented in  4 , and in  5 we briefly summarize and discuss the different implications of these results .",
    "models for the formation of dust precursors in similar environments will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( cherchneff & dwek in preparation ) .",
    "currently , there are no observational constraints on the pop  iii supernovae events and the evolution of their explosive ejcta",

    "we derive simple analytical expressions for the gas parameters such as temperature , number density and velocity and consider various levels of mixing in the ejecta .",
    "three progenitor masses are studied : two massive progenitors of mass 170 @xmath0  and 270 @xmath0  chosen as surrogates to pisne , and one low mass 20 @xmath0  progenitor chosen to describe primordial ccsne .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath12 in the post - explosion gas is determined mainly by the explosion energy which is released as kinetic energy into the gas .",

    "each model is characterized by an explosion energy , a mass cut marking the division between the matter which remains in the core and that which is ejected and the @xmath13ni  mass produced in the explosion above the mass cut . by solving the radiative transfer equation taking into account the energy deposition by radioactive elements , nk03 derive temperature profiles for each of their massive progenitor ejecta . for our pisne models",

    "we are interested in studying the chemistry from time @xmath17 = 100 days to t = 1000 days .",
    "the initial time range is justified by the appearance of co , sio and dust as early as 110 , 160 , and 450 days , respectively , in the ejecta of ( catchpole & glass 1987 , danziger et al .",

    "our pisn ejecta are hotter than that of but similar temperature regimes are encountered at times t @xmath42 300 days . the final time is determined by the time when the gas density and temperature in the ejecta are too low to foster efficient gas - phase molecular formation .",
    "the ejecta parameters are summarized in table  1 whereas the variation of the gas density and temperature with time t is illustrated in figure 1 for the various progenitor masses considered .",
    "mixing is likely to occur during explosion for the instability of the nickel bubble resulting in the development of rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( woosley 1988 , arnett 1988 , herant & benz 1991 , mller et al .",

    "the presence of type x silicon carbide ( sic ) grains and silicon nitride ( s@xmath43n@xmath44 ) inclusions bearing the @xmath45ti supernova signature in meteorites suggests deep and inhomogeneous mixing between the various heavy element mass shells ( zinner 2006 ) . as to light elements ,",
    "hydrogen deep mixing down to the inner mass zones is invoked to explain the plateau shape of light curve at times greater than 80 days ( woosley 1988 , arnett & fu 1989 , shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) .",

    "1991 , kifonidis et al .",
    "2003 ) . to circumvent the problem of the complexity of mixing , nk03 considered explosive models with and without mixing , which result in two extreme cases for their ejecta : a fully mixed gas and a stratified ejecta",
    "in which each layer reflects the prior nucleosynthesis stages of the progenitor , except for the inner most layer which is the result of explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "we follow the same strategy in the present paper : for the two very massive progenitors , 170 @xmath0  and 270 @xmath0  and the core - collapse sn progenitor , 20 @xmath0 , we consider fully mixed ejecta while stratified ejecta are studied for the 170 @xmath0  and 20 @xmath0  progenitors .",
    "the initial chemical compositions for the primordial supernova ejecta models are taken from fully mixed and unmixed explosion models .",
    "for fully mixed ejecta , mass yields are from un02 and heger & woosley ( 2002 ) for our massive 170  @xmath0  and 270  @xmath0  progenitors and from un02 for the 20  @xmath0  ccsn model .",
    "the unmixed ejecta compositions for the 170  @xmath0  progenitor and the 20  @xmath0  progenitor are those of nk03 .",
    "we subdivide their helium cores in zones of distinct chemical composition .",
    "for the 170  @xmath0  progenitor , we consider five distinct zones : ( 1 ) is si / s / fe - rich from 0 to 20  @xmath0 , ( 2 ) is o / si / s - rich from 20 to 40  @xmath0 , ( 3 ) is o / mg / si - rich from 40 to 55  @xmath0 , ( 4 ) is o / c / mg - rich from 55 to 78  @xmath0 , and finally ( 5 ) is o / c / he - rich from 78 to 82  @xmath0 .",

    "we use these elemental mass yields to calculate the total number of elemental species , the gas initial molecular weight @xmath46 and gas number density @xmath47 .",
    "we then derive the number density at 100 days post - explosion for each element , and use these data as initial conditions when solving our set of non - linear , coupled , differential equations ( see section 3 ) .",
    "these data along with the resulting initial gas mean molecular weight are tabulated in table 4 for fully - mixed ejecta whilst table 5 summarizes the post - explosion chemical composition as a function of zoning for our unmixed ejecta models .",
    "we then explore the effect of hydrogen mixing by diffusion from the progenitor envelope for the 170 @xmath0  fully - mixed ejecta . in doing so",

    "the reactions with activation energy barriers require high temperatures to overcome the energy barrier whereas reactions without activation energy can proceed at lower temperatures ; ( 3 ) ion - molecule reactions ( formation / destruction reactions and charge exchange processes ) , which have no energy barrier and can therefore contribute at low gas temperatures ; ( 4 ) temperature - independent radiative association reactions ( hereafter ra ) in which the formation of a species occurs through the emission of a photon which carries off the excess energy released in the formation of the adduct .    because of the unique nature of sn ejecta , being powered by the decay of radioactive elements and its high temperatures , we also consider the effects of various non - thermal processes including the destruction of molecules by the cascade of energetic electrons and uv photons that are generated by the down - scattering of @xmath11 rays in the ejecta .",

    "in the following sections , we present the abundances and the mass ejected at day 1000 of molecules produced in fully - mixed and unmixed ejecta of supernovae , excluding those that are dust molecular precursors . results for gas - phase dust precursors and small clusters will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( cherchneff & dwek in preparation ) .",
    "previous studies of molecular formation in sn1987a assumed that the chemistry was at steady state , implying that species number densities did not vary with time ( lepp et al .",
    "1990 , liu & dalgarno 1994 , 1995 , gearhart et al . 1999 ,",
    "clayton et al . 2001 ) .",
    "such assumption was also made by todini & ferrrara ( 2001 ) and sfs04 in their studies of dust formation in primeval supernovae .",
    "when a small number of chemical reactions is considered , the steady state approximation may be valid , allowing for the direct derivation of analytical solutions for chemical abundances .",
    "this assumption requires that at early times , the rates of the chemical reactions be fast compared to the rate of density and temperature changes in the ejecta , so that chemical abundances would quickly reach their equilibrium value . however , fast chemistry does not a priori ensure the validity of the steady state approximation in larger chemical systems . indeed ,",
    "such large systems bring a greater complexity in terms of chemical rates .",
    "certain species may reach steady state abundances while others are still being formed or destroyed under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "figure  2 illustrates this point for the 170  @xmath0   progenitor fully - mixed ejecta , by comparing select reaction rates to @xmath98 , the inverse dynamical timescale , which is defined as : @xmath99 where @xmath38 is the ejecta velocity given by eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) and listed in table  1 , and @xmath86 is the ejecta position at a given time @xmath79 after explosion .",
    "the rates depicted in the figure correspond to those of the major chemical processes involved in the formation and destruction of carbon monoxide , co. the formation processes are the radiative association reaction ( ra4 ) @xmath100 and the bimolecular process ( nn56 ) @xmath101 the major co destruction processes are the bimolecular process ( nn70 ) @xmath102 the reaction with helium ions ( im13 ) @xmath103 and the collision with @xmath11-rays - induced compton electrons ( ced31 ) given by @xmath104    we see from figure 2 that prior to @xmath10 480 days post - explosion , all reaction rates are larger than the dynamical rate @xmath105 .",
    "a fast chemistry takes place but reactions proceed more or less efficiently , resulting in a non - equilibrium chemistry and a drive towards formation of molecules . at times greater than 480 days , the ra rate becomes smaller than @xmath105 and the reaction freezes out when bimolecular processes are still active in building up molecules .",
    "compton electron and he@xmath6 reactions are always important in destroying co up to 900 days and 700 days post - explosion , respectively .",
    "therefore , the relevant processes to co chemistry are activated and switched off at different times in the ejecta , and the chemistry is by no means at steady - state over the time period of interest . consequently",
    ", molecular abundances show strong variations with time regardless of the initial composition and mixing in the ejecta .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "we first consider the chemistry of the fully - microscopically - mixed helium cores for the primordial sn surrogates under study , exploring the impact of hydrogen mixing on the ejecta chemistry and the dependence of results on the progenitor mass .",
    "no uv destruction rates have been included in these models .",
    "molecular abundances for the 170 @xmath0  surrogate are shown in figure 3 considering two cases : ( a ) when no hydrogen is mixed into the he core , and ( b ) when 10% of the hydrogen mass of the progenitor s envelope is microscopically - mixed uniformly throughout the he core . in the absence of hydrogen ,",
    "there exist two phases of molecular formation as illustrated in figure 3a .",
    "the first phase arises at @xmath10 350 days when three molecules dominate the ejecta : silicon monoxide , sio , silicon sulfide , sis , and carbon monoxide , co. for sis and co , the dominant building process is radiative association accounting for more than 94 % of the total formation rate , whereas for sio , ra accounts for only @xmath10 56% of the formation rate .",
    "the extra formation pathway is the si reaction with co leading to the buildup of sio from co. destruction of sis and sio occurs through reactions with he@xmath6 at the same time that sio is being formed by the destruction of co. at times close to 440 days , silicon - based dust precursors ( i.e. , small ( sio)@xmath106 and ( sio@xmath2)@xmath106 clusters ) start forming due to the cooler gas temperatures , and thus deplete si - bearing molecules and sio . reaction with he@xmath6 remains an important destruction channel for sis , sio and co but for the latter , fast compton electrons also contribute to the destruction .",
    "the second phase of molecular formation starts at @xmath10 700 days when most of sio is depleted into dust precursors .",
    "co molecules keep forming from ra and nn reactions involving atomic oxygen and carbon .",
    "the formation of o - bearing species like o@xmath2 and so are mainly triggered by nn processes involving atomic oxygen and sulphur .",
    "molecular destruction is driven by nn processes as well since he@xmath6 has recombined to neutral and the level of ionization has decreased by a factor of 100 in the ejecta . to summarize , the first phase of molecular formation at high temperatures is triggered by ra processes involving atomic species , whereas the second low - temperature phase is driven by nn reactions with small activation energy barriers .",
    "when hydrogen penetration from the progenitor envelope is allowed to a level of 10 % of the progenitor hydrogen mass , an active and complex nn chemistry induced by radicals such as oh and ch , comes to play .",
    "the radical reservoir is fed by the products of reaction between heavy elements and molecular hydrogen .",
    "these radicals boost at early post - explosion times the formation of molecules like so , no , and o@xmath2 , the latter contributing to co formation via reaction with atomic carbon .",
    "although some of the processes mentioned in the previous section ( i.e. , reaction with he@xmath6 , ra processes ) are still active , the whole kinetics is dominated by nn processes with and without activation energy barriers .",
    "indeed , we see form figure 3b that molecular formation is already fully developed at day 300 , converting a large fraction of the ejecta into molecules .",
    "after 700 days , co is converted to co@xmath2 from its reaction with oh and the ejecta is composed of o@xmath2 , so , co@xmath2 and h@xmath2 .",
    "the molecular masses for the dominant species ejected at day 1000 are listed in table 6 for the fully - mixed ejecta as well as the efficiency at forming molecules defined as the ratio of the molecular mass to the helium core mass . for the h - free fully - mixed ejecta of the 170 @xmath0  progenitor ,",
    "the dominant ejected species are co and so and the total molecular component of the ejecta equals @xmath10 11.3 @xmath0 . defining the molecule formation efficiency as the fraction of the ejected he - core mass that is converted to molecules",
    ", we get a formation efficiency of @xmath10 13.7 % .",
    "as expected , its h - rich counterpart produces a much larger molecular mass .",
    "it chiefly forms o@xmath2 , so and co@xmath2 and the total molecular mass is @xmath3 @xmath0 , corresponding to a formation efficiency of @xmath10 57 % .",
    "models assuming fully microscopically mixed ejecta are highly unrealistic , since observations of young sn remnants show that their ejecta are unmixed .",
    "our purpose in admixing h is to illustrate the paramount effect of hydrogen on molecular synthesis in the ejecta .",
    "hence , any hydrogen that microscopically mixes with nearby heavy elements at the interface of finger structures and inhomogeneities should induce efficient synthesis of h - bearing radicals and molecules .",
    "conversely , he@xmath6 is detrimental to molecular formation , as first stressed by lepp et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in their attempt to modeling co in sn1987a .",
    "indeed , its attack represents one of the principal destruction channels to molecules whereas attack by compton electron always plays a minor role .",
    "this may not be the case for the unmixed ejecta , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we now turn to study the impact of the progenitor mass on the ejecta chemistry .",
    "we consider a massive progenitor surrogate of mass 270 @xmath0  so that we can directly compare results to those obtained in the previous section for the 170 @xmath0  pisn progenitor .",
    "we also consider a ccsn with a 20 @xmath0  progenitor to see if lower mass ejecta can efficiently form a molecular phase or not . as shown in tables  1 and 4 , different masses for pop .",
    "iii stars imply different initial chemical compositions , explosion energies , ejection velocities , gas temperatures , and number densities .",
    "the gas column depths and opacities will change too , resulting in the compton electron destruction rates listed in table 4 . in both cases , no hydrogen penetration into the helium core",
    "is included .",
    "molecular abundances with respect to total gas number density are presented in figure 4 .    from the comparison of figures  4 and 3",
    "we see that the same species form in the 170 @xmath0  and the 270 @xmath0  ejecta . however , molecular formation is delayed for the more massive ejecta to day 550 primarily due to the higher gas temperatures .",
    "the chemical processes at play are identical to those mentioned in section 4.2.1 .",
    "sio is too depleted on day 500 at the onset of dust precursor nucleation . as to molecular abundances",
    ", they are globally lower for the 270 @xmath0  progenitor due to a less favourable initial chemical composition of the ejecta gas at 100 days post - explosion .",
    "indeed , we see from table 4 that the mass of helium ( and thus he@xmath6 ) relative to the total progenitor mass is larger for the 270 @xmath0  surrogate compared to the 170 @xmath0  progenitor . the oxygen and carbon contents are also lower , resulting in smaller co abundances in the ejecta .",
    "these conditions conspire to delay the formation of molecules , which consequently takes place at lower gas densities resulting in lower formation efficiencies .",
    "the results are summarized in table 6 which compares the molecular yield of the 170 @xmath0  and the 270 @xmath0  pisne without and with hydrogen mixing .",
    "therefore , low - mass pisne coming from pop .",
    "iii progenitors should form more molecules in their ejecta than their very massive counterparts .",
    "it is of interest to compare the present results for the 170 @xmath0  and 270 @xmath0  surrogates to the study of dust formation in the fully - mixed ejecta of pisn by sfs04 .",
    "their modeling of dust formation accounts for the formation of co and sio following the formalism of todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) . however , both studies derive co and sio masses assuming those molecules form at steady state , and consider only one formation channel ( ra reaction ) and one destruction channel via collision with compton electrons . sfs04",
    "derive a total co mass of @xmath107 and 0.01 @xmath0  in the ejecta of the 170  @xmath0  and 260  @xmath0  pisn , respectively , but they do not show the evolution of molecular mass with time . in our model ,",
    "the co mass ejected at 1000 days after the explosion of the 170  @xmath0  progenitor is 5.8  @xmath0 , seemingly in good agreement with the sfs04 value .",
    "however , we ascribe this result to pure coincidence , since the chemical approaches and physical models used in our studies are totally different from theirs . in particular , sfs04 assume much lower temperatures in their pisn ejecta than ours .",
    "furthermore , their initial carbon yield is that of heger & woosley ( 2002 ) which is twice as large as our initial carbon mass taken from umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) , suggesting a lower co formation efficiency in their model .",
    "there is also a great discrepancy between the co yield calculated by sfs04 for their 260  @xmath0  progenitor , and our co yield for the 270 @xmath0  progenitor , which is about 300 times larger .",
    "we see from figure 4 that co formation proceeds at times greater than 500 days via non - steady state chemistry .",
    "nn bimolecular processes such as the reaction of atomic carbon with molecular oxygen commands co formation whereas the dominant destruction channel is he@xmath6 attack .",
    "these mechanisms are not considered in the sfs04 study .",
    "all shortcomings in the sfs04 models point out the importance of using a kinetic approach to _ both _ processes , the synthesis of molecules and the nucleation of dust in the ejecta .",
    "the two are intrinsically linked , since the formation of molecules ( that are not dust precursors ) depletes the ejecta from refractory elements that would otherwise be included in the dust formation process .    in the 20 @xmath0  case ,",
    "molecular formation patterns are quite different . on one hand ,",
    "the lower ejecta temperatures foster molecular synthesis . on the other hand ,",
    "the large helium content of the ejecta and the resulting higher he@xmath6 abundances efficiently inhibit molecule production .",
    "the initial elemental composition also implies less refractory elements like si or mg available for the formation of molecules and the nucleation of metal oxides .",
    "the combination of the paucity of refractory elements and the elevated he@xmath6 abundances at times less than 700 days explain the low molecular abundances , as illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "once he@xmath6 has recombined at late times , the formation of molecules like co , so and o@xmath2 can proceed .",
    "we see from table  6 that the fully - mixed ejecta of ccsne are as efficient as their massive counterparts at synthesizing molecules at late post - explosion times .",
    "as stressed in the previous section , it is unlikely that sn ejecta are fully microscopically - mixed .",
    "we thus consider totally unmixed ejecta in which each mass zone of the helium core has retained the stratified pre - explosive stellar composition , except for the inner most mass zone whose composition reflects the explosion nucleosynthesis .",
    "we further assume that the elements are microscopically - mixed within each mass zone .",
    "results for the unmixed ejecta of two primordial sne , one 170 @xmath0  pisn and a 20 @xmath0  ccsn , are presented in the following sections .",
    "the zoning and initial elemental compositions are those of table 5 , and we explore the impact on the chemistry of a secondary ultraviolet ( uv ) field as defined in section 3.1.2 .",
    "molecular abundances normalized to the total gas number density are shown in figure  5 for zones  1 and 2 , in figure  6 for zones  3 and 4 , and in figure  7 for zone 5 . in zone  1 ,",
    "the formation of s@xmath2 is coupled to that of sis and fes .",
    "the major formation process for sis is the nn72 reaction s@xmath2 + si @xmath108 sis + s , whilst the ra reaction between atomic s and si contributes to a lesser extent .",
    "the reverse reaction of the nn channel is actually the major formation process for s@xmath2 .",
    "however , since the initial mass of si is four times larger than that of s , the net formation of sis is always more efficient than that of s@xmath2 .",
    "after @xmath109  days , the reservoir of s@xmath2 is depleted through the continuous formation of sis and the simultaneous formation of fes , the molecular precursor to iron sulfide clusters , through the reaction of fe with s@xmath2 ( see figure 5a ) . as a result ,",
    "sis is the most abundant molecules formed in zone 1 .    in zone  2",
    ", most molecules are rapidly formed from ra processes whereas thermal fragmentation is the dominant destruction process at early times , due to the high gas temperatures . o@xmath2 and sio formation",
    "are coupled , for o@xmath2 is partly destroyed by the nn69 reaction with atomic si to form sio . at @xmath10 250 days post - explosion , sio abundance decreases due to nucleation of silica dust precursors such as ( sio)@xmath106 , resulting in a sharp increase of o@xmath2 abundance . as so and",
    "co are also formed in the nn reaction of o@xmath2 with s and c atoms ( reactions nn76 and nn56 , respectively ) , their abundances show a steep rise with increasing o@xmath2 .",
    "the low amount of co formed in the gas is due to the initial low carbon content of this mass zone .",
    "the chemical processes pertaining to zone  2 also apply to zone  3 and the resulting molecules are similar to those of zone  2 , as seen in figure  6a .",
    "the differences in abundance variation and magnitude with time are due to the different initial chemical composition of zone  3 .",
    "specifically , the higher carbon initial mass yield drives the formation of co via ra process at early times , depleting some of the atomic oxygen available to the formation of o@xmath2 and resulting in higher co abundances and lower o@xmath2 and so abundances over time than in zone  2 .",
    "despite the fact that zone  4 is oxygen - rich , it is characterized by high initial carbon mass compared to zones  2 and 3 ( see table 5 ) . however , it is expected that its initial chemical composition precludes formation of carbon - rich molecules other than co as its c / o ratio is @xmath10 0.29 .",
    "however , we see from inspection of figure 6b that very early on , c@xmath2 and c@xmath43 form in large amounts . this carbon chain formation is a consequence of the thermal fragmentation of co at very high temperatures and its rapid conversion to c@xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "fragmentation studies of co in shock tube experiments at temperatures between 5000 k and 18000 k show that c@xmath2 and electronically - excited co@xmath110 are always detected along with the collisional destruction of co in the high temperature post - shock gas ( fairbairn et al .",
    "1968 , appleton et al . 1970 , hanson 1973 ) .",
    "this is readily explained by the following chemical mechanism ( labelled tf13 , nn57 and tf18 in table 9 ) : @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 where m is the colliding buffer gas ( chosen as ar , o , c , or co in shock tube experiments ) , and all reactions and their reverse processes occur simultaneously .",
    "we see that along with the destruction of co by collision with m , its rapid conversion to c@xmath2 occurs through reaction with atomic carbon [ eq .",
    "( [ cco ] ) ] .",
    "chemical rates characterizing these reactions have high activation energy barriers and thus only proceed at high temperatures .",
    "indeed , at temperatures less than 5000 k , rates for reactions ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) become small . as to c@xmath43",
    ", the build - up of the end - product of the carbon chains is due to its formation from reaction of two c@xmath2 molecules which rapidly depletes c@xmath2 chains from the gas , as seen in figure 6b .",
    "a carbon dust mass yield can not be derived from the c@xmath43 abundance profile , for the formation of c - bearing large chains and rings has not yet been included in the chemical network .",
    "it is expected that c@xmath43 will be transformed in larger carbon chains and that atomic oxygen in the gas will partly destroy those chains through the formation of co. therefore , carbon chain abundances should be smaller than values for c@xmath43 derived in this study .",
    "however , the quick conversion of co into c@xmath2 will keep triggering the build - up of carbon dust molecular precursors in this o - rich mass zone .",
    "two rates are reported in the literature for the c  +  co reaction : a fast rate calculated by fairbairn et al .",
    "( 1968 ) and hanson et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , which we use in our ejecta model , and a value listed in the udfa06 database but with no traceable reference ( woodhall et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the latter is @xmath10 10 times smaller than the former .",
    "we ran the full model for zone  4 including the lowest rate and find that the c@xmath43 abundance at day 1000 is decreased by a factor of 3 , the co abundance is increased by a factor of 6 , and the o@xmath2 abundance is decreased by 30% compared to the values illustrated in figure 6b . in both cases however , the quick co conversation to c@xmath2 via the c  +  co reaction observed in thermal fragmentation experiments is a natural mechanism to produce carbon - bearing species and carbon dust in a hot , oxygen - rich environment where carbon is initially in atomic form . when co conversion to c@xmath2 is not considered , no c@xmath2 forms in large enough quantities to provide significant amounts of the end - product carbon chain c@xmath43 .",
    "to account for the formation of carbon dust in ccsne , clayton et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) proposed that co dissociates in a fully - mixed ejecta from collisions with compton electrons and reactions with he@xmath6 .",
    "the chemistry is assumed to be at steady state and co dissociation creates a pool of carbon atoms from which carbon chains and solid clusters can nucleate and condense .",
    "however , we see from section 4.1 that under non - steady state conditions , the two mechanisms invoked by clayton et al .",
    "do not succeed in destroying enough co to provide free carbon atoms .",
    "indeed , for the three hydrogen - free mixed ejecta , co is always the dominant species synthesized in the gas .",
    "furthermore , he@xmath6 being a predator to molecules at early times , co formation is delayed to post - explosion times characterized by temperatures low enough to preclude the quick co conversion to c@xmath2 from operating .",
    "we conclude that fully - mixed sn ejecta can not form free atomic carbon and carbon - based solids in general .",
    "conversely , unmixed sn ejecta , in particular he - free zones where oxygen is more abundant than carbon , can generate carbon chains from the quick conversion of co through the c  +  co reaction operating at high temperatures . as to prevalent chemical formation processes in zone  4 , we find that both ra reactions and nn bimolecular routes are active at high temperatures to forming species which are destroyed by thermal fragmentation reactions .",
    "molecular formation and destruction in the intermediate temperature regime ( 1000 k - 5000 k ) are too governed by nn bimolecular reactions when destruction via collisions with compton electron also participate but to a much less extent .    as to zone 5",
    ", we see from figure 7 that the major molecule to form is carbon monoxide . in the outer zone",
    ", the formation of he@xmath6 at early times triggers the simultaneous formation of ions like o@xmath6 and c@xmath6 .",
    "nn processes are then not as important as they are in other zones for the formation of molecules .",
    "this fact , combined with the destruction of species by he@xmath6 , hampers the effective formation of molecules over most of the post - explosion times .",
    "co , and to a less extent o@xmath2 , thus form at late times after he@xmath6 recombination .",
    "the molecular masses ejected at day 1000 are summarized for all zones in table 7 and illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "the efficiencies listed are defined as the ratio of the molecular mass formed per zone to the zone mass .",
    "the value in the last column corresponds to the total molecular mass formed in the unmixed ejecta divided by the summed mass of the zones . in the unmixed case ,",
    "molecules reflect the chemical composition of the zone in which they form .",
    "dioxygen o@xmath2 is by far the most abundant species in the ejecta and form efficiently in three mass zones when sis too forms in large amount but is confined to the innermost region of the he core .",
    "the final molecular content of the ejecta equals @xmath10 37.1 @xmath0 , and the total formation efficiency is 45.07 % , a very high value .",
    "it means that massive pisne are effective at converting almost half of their initial atomic content into a molecular phase .",
    "this value is much larger than that for the fully - microscopically mixed case without hydrogen mixing .",
    "this result once again illustrates the primary role of he@xmath6 in impeding the formation of molecules .",
    "the impact of the uv field as described in section 3.1.2 is explored for zone 4 which produces the largest amount of molecules .",
    "the results on molecule abundances are shown in figure 9 .",
    "formation and destruction processes for the dominant species are similar to those when no uv field is considered . while thermal fragmentation and nn bimolecular reactions remain the dominant destruction processes at high temperatures , molecular destruction by uv becomes effective at times greater than @xmath10 day 350 , reducing the abundances of some important molecules .",
    "specifically , o@xmath2 is affected as its formation is postponed to later times , as seen in figure 9 .",
    "the final o@xmath2 abundance at day 1000 is decreased by 30 % compared to its value when no uv radiation is considered .",
    "however , the overall major chemical processes involved in molecular synthesis remain identical .",
    "we also consider uv photodissociation in our fully - mixed sn ejecta and find that the impact of uv photodissociation is minor compared to the destruction of chemical species by he@xmath6 .",
    "we thus conclude that uv photoprocesses if present have some minor impact as destruction channels to molecules and that their effect on the overall chemistry of the ejecta is limited .",
    "we now turn to studying the unmixed ejecta of a zero - metallicity , 20  @xmath0  progenitor core - collapse supernova .",
    "results for zones  1 , 2 and 3 as defined in table  5 are presented in figures  10 and 11 .",
    "these zones provide most of the molecules in the ejecta as seen from table 8 , which gives the total molecular masses formed in each zone at day 1000 .",
    "these mass yields are illustrated in figure 12 .",
    "the chemical processes which occur in zone  1 are similar to those at play in zone 1 of the 170 @xmath0  unmixed ejecta , resulting in the ejection of large amounts of sis a day 1000 .",
    "however , large amounts of oxygen and carbon compared to silicon and sulphur are initially presented in the initial composition of the 20 @xmath0  ccsn , resulting in an active carbon chemistry .",
    "for example , cs forms in large quantities from the reaction of atomic c with s@xmath2 and co abundances are too enhanced compared to zone 1 of the 170  @xmath0  ejecta .",
    "the chemistry of zone 2 is similar to that at play in zone 2 of the 170  @xmath0  pisn , that is , early formation of most molecules by ra reactions and destruction by thermal fragmentation , and coupled chemical processes for the formation of o@xmath2 , sio , co and so at later times .",
    "the dominant species ejected at day 1000 are o@xmath2 , so and co , as illustrated in figure 10b .",
    "zone 3 can be compared to zone 4 of the 170  @xmath0  progenitor case as both zones are characterized by a c / o ratio less than 1 ( 0.33 and 0.29 for the 20  @xmath0  zone 3 and the 170  @xmath0  zone 4 , respectively ) and are helium - free .",
    "similar chemical processes are effective at building up molecules in both zones .",
    "the rapid conversion of co to c@xmath2 once again triggers the formation of carbon chains in zone 3 but the overall process is less efficient than for the 170  @xmath0  progenitor owing to the lower temperatures in the ejecta .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 10b where co always remains more abundant than the carbon - chain end product c@xmath43 , and is gradually converted into o@xmath2 at late post - explosion times by its reaction with atomic oxygen .    in zone 4 ,",
    "characterized by a large he mass and a c / o ratio of 29.5 , the mass of molecules formed is negligible as seen from table 8 .",
    "this is primarily due to the initial chemical composition of the zone where more than 98% of the mass is helium while c and o only represent 1.7% and 0.08% of the zone mass , respectively .",
    "molecules once formed are chiefly destroyed by he@xmath6 at any times in the ejecta owing to its overwhelming presence .",
    "table 8 and figure 12 show that low - mass , zero - metallicity progenitors are almost as efficient at forming a molecular phase in their ejecta than their massive counterparts .",
    "the total efficiency at forming molecules is 35.65% , a slightly lower value than that of the 170  @xmath0  case .",
    "this lower efficiency is primarily due to the 20  @xmath0  zone  4 , which , as discussed above , does not form molecules .",
    "we have investigated the chemistry of the ejecta of pop .",
    "iii progenitor sne and find that copious amounts of molecules form in these inhospitable environments",
    ". of particular importance are the following points :    * as already stated by cl08 , the chemistry in sn ejecta is not at steady state from 100 to 1000 days after explosion .",
    "new chemical channels involving neutral - neutral processes prevail over radiative association reactions , compton electron destruction routes and photodissociation by ambient ultraviolet photons .",
    "ion - molecule reactions play a role at late times when the ejecta is cool and diffuse .",
    "our results for relevant molecules like co or sio disagree with existing studies due to the fact that the chemistry is not at steady state .",
    "we find that the chemistry of pop .",
    "iii sn ejecta , owing to the large ranges of temperatures and densities spanned over relatively short times , is complex , manifold , and conducive to molecule synthesis . *",
    "a new pathway to the formation of carbon chains is active in the oxygen - rich mass zone of the unmixed ejecta and is identified as the co conversion to c@xmath2 via collision with c. this fast conversion is usually observed in the thermal fragmentation of carbon monoxide in high temperature shock tube experiments . when this conversation is suppressed , no carbon - bearing molecules and chains are formed .",
    "thus , this conversion channel triggers the formation of carbon chains and dust in an oxygen - rich gas .",
    "it is then relevant to any gaseous o - rich environment characterized by high temperatures ( t @xmath8 5000 k ) and a large atomic carbon fraction .",

    "we find that the injection of hydrogen from the progenitor envelope in fully - mixed ejecta boosts molecular synthesis via the formation of radicals like oh .",
    "this result too applies to unmixed ejecta . on the other hand , we show that helium severely hampers the formation of molecules through he@xmath6 attack .",
    "therefore , the detection of molecules in sn ejecta brings evidence for the non - mixing of helium with other elements in the ejecta gas . *",
    "the results of our calculations show that the fully - mixed 170  @xmath0  and 270  @xmath0  progenitors produce 11  @xmath0  and 3.2  @xmath0  of molecules , respectively .",
    "therefore , a larger progenitor mass does not imply a larger molecular content of the ejecta .",
    "this is chiefly due to the harsh physical conditions encountered in the ejecta of the 270  @xmath0  progenitor and to its initial chemical composition . indeed , although the 270 @xmath0  model is characterized by larger heavy element masses with respect to its 170 @xmath0  counterpart , its helium mass is almost three times greater than that of the 170  @xmath0  case , implying efficient destruction of molecules .",
    "the admixing of 10% of the hydrogen present in the 170  @xmath0  progenitor envelope into the fully - mixed ejecta dramatically increases its molecular yield to @xmath3  @xmath0 .",
    "the more realistic unmixed ejecta of a 170  @xmath0  progenitor supernova synthesizes @xmath4  @xmath0  of molecules at post - explosion day 1000 , which is significant .",
    "about half of the initial elemental content of the he core is converted into molecules .",
    "the most abundant species by mass is o@xmath2 followed by sis , co and so .",
    "its 20  @xmath0  counterpart produces @xmath5",
    "o@xmath2 is the dominant species followed by co , sis , and so .",
    "this lower efficiency at forming chemical species for the low mass ccsn is due to the existence of its extended helium - rich outer zone in which molecular synthesis is suppressed . *",
    "the present results hold for pop .",
    "iii sne but the large mass yields of molecules formed in their ejecta address the possibility of potential observational detection of new molecules in nearby sn ejecta . as stated above , our primordial 20  @xmath0  progenitor forms o@xmath2 , co , sis , and so shortly after explosion .",
    "co and sio have already been detected at ir wavelengths in several sn ejecta .",
    "however , molecules like sis and o@xmath2 are tracers of stratified , unmixed ejecta while microscopic mixing with hydrogen produces tracer species like co@xmath2 , oh and h@xmath2o .",
    "search for those chemical species should be undertaken at ir and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "the large amounts of molecules synthesized in the pisn ejecta are exposed to a harsh environment generated by the pisn blast wave .",
    "the shock expanding into the ambient circumstellar / interstellar medium generates fast particles that are accelerated to cosmic rays energies .",
    "these penetrate the cavity generated by the blast wave subjecting the ejecta to the constant bombardment by high energy electrons and nuclei .",
    "the pressure of the material that is shock - heated by the advancing blast wave will generate a reverse shock that will move into the expanding pisn ejecta ( e.g. ,  nozawa et al . 2007 ) .",
    "locally , observations of young supernova , such as cas  a , show that their ejecta is very clumpy , the clumps consisting of x - ray filaments with densities @xmath114  @xmath115 , and optical- and ir - line emitting knots with densities of @xmath116  @xmath115 ( fesen et al .",
    "2006 , smith et al .",
    "therefore , the fate of the ejected molecules will depend on their environment .",
    "low density filaments are heated by the reverse shock to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "chemical species are not likely to survive this harsh environment .",
    "the dust and molecules inside the optical- and ir - line emitting clumps will encounter a much slower shock .",
    "their fate will depend on the relative timescales of many different processes operating in the cavity of the young remnant : the radiative cooling time of the shocked clump , the timescales for the heating of the clump by thermal conduction and ambient cosmic rays , the evaporation timescale of the clump , and the timescale for the development of various instabilities that can lead to its fragmentation and subsequent evaporation .",
    "any surviving molecules will be further subjected to the general diffuse interstellar uv radiation field generated by the pop  iii stars .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that the molecules synthesized in the pop  iii sn ejecta will have any global cosmological impact .",
    "however , they can have a significant local impact .",
    "the expanding pisn blast wave will generate during the radiative phase of its evolution a cold dense shell .",
    "this shell may be subject to various instabilities that can cause its collapse , forming the next generation of stellar objects ( mackey et al .",
    "2003 , schneider et al .",
    "these stars , commonly referred to as pop  2.5 stars , will form out of a gas that contains an admixture of the heavy elements , molecules , and dust that formed in the pisn ejecta .",
    "the mass of these stellar objects will depend on their ability to fragment into smaller structures , which is greatly facilitated by the cooling rate of the gas via atomic and molecular processes , and by the conversion of the cloud s internal energy to infrared emission by dust ( bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "the survival of the molecules and dust , and their effect on the formation of stars in this propagating star formation scenario will be explored in a subsequent paper .",

    "<S> we study the formation and destruction of molecules in the ejecta of population  iii supernovae ( sne ) using a chemical kinetic approach to follow the evolution of molecular abundances from day 100 to day 1000 after explosion . </S>",

    "<S> all relevant molecule formation and destruction processes that are unique to the sn environment are considered . </S>",
    "<S> our work focuses on zero - metallicity progenitors with masses of 20 , 170 , and 270  @xmath0 , and we study the effect of different levels of heavy element mixing and the inward diffusion of hydrogen and helium on the ejecta chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ejecta chemistry does not reach a steady state within the relevant timespan ( @xmath1  yr ) for molecule formation , thus invalidating previous results relying on this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the primary species formed in the harsh sn environment are o@xmath2 , co , sis , and so . </S>",
    "<S> the sio , formed as early as 200 days after explosion , is rapidly depleted by the formation of silica molecular precursors in the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid conversion of co to c@xmath2 and its thermal fractionation at temperatures above 5000 k allow for the formation of carbon chains in the oxygen - rich zone of the unmixed models , providing an important pathway for the formation of carbon dust in hot environments where the c / o ratio is less than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fully - mixed ejecta of a 170  @xmath0  progenitor synthesizes 11.3 @xmath0  of molecules whereas 20 @xmath0  and 270 @xmath0  progenitors produce 0.78 , and 3.2  @xmath0  of molecules , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the admixing of 10% of hydrogen into the fully - mixed ejecta of the 170  @xmath0  progenitor increases its molecular yield to @xmath3  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the unmixed ejecta of a 170  @xmath0  progenitor supernova without hydrogen penetration synthesizes @xmath4  @xmath0  of molecules , whereas its 20  @xmath0  counterpart produces @xmath5  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this smaller efficiency at forming molecules is due to the large fraction of he@xmath6 in the outer mass zone of the ejecta . </S>",
