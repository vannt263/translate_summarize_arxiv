    "this type of cml has been already studied in @xcite : it has been observed that in a certain parameter range @xmath0 can be finite even if the map is non chaotic .",

    "[ fig : vlvnl ] ( b ) . at variance with the shift map",
    "( that is an everywhere expanding map ) the considered map shows contracting and expanding intervals .",
    "therefore the disturbances during their spatio - temporal evolution can be alternatively expanded or contracted .",

    "on the other hand , in the class of systems for which @xmath182 there are also stable and marginally stable systems .",
    "therefore , a propagation due solely to non linear terms can still be present @xcite . in this section",
    "we want to discuss the possible employ of the fsle to characterize these maps .    before entering into the description of the fsle computation in such systems , it is of interest to recall an important phenomenon which appears in stable systems : the so - called `` stable chaos '' @xcite .",
    "stable systems asymptotically evolve towards trivial attractors ( i.e. fixed points , periodic or quasi - periodic orbits ) .",
    "however , in spatially extended systems it may happen that the time needed to reach the asymptotic state is very long : it has been found that in certain stable cml the transient time diverges exponentially with the number of elements of the chain @xcite .",
    "moreover , this transient is characterized by a quasi - stationary behavior allowing for the investigation of the properties of the model with statistical consistency . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a chain of coupled maps of the type ( [ eq : stable ] ) , considered in their discontinuous limit ( i.e. for @xmath73 ) , is non chaotic but still exhibits erratic behaviors .",
    "this is associated to a non - zero information spreading within the system .",
    "as far as the computation of the fsle for these systems is concerned , some remarks are worth to be done . the definition of the fsle in term of error doubling times can not be used in a straightforward manner to determine negative expansion rates .",
    "another important point is that , at variance with the case of chaotic maps , finite perturbations should be now considered in order to observe an expansion .",
    "these two points impede a straightforward implementation of our method to study these systems . indeed ,",

    "indeed , the only way to have an independence of @xmath94 from the initial conditions is to initialize the system with infinitesimal perturbations and then to follow them until they become finite due to the dynamics of the system ( see ref .",

    "the coupled ( [ eq : stable ] ) maps for @xmath183 have been recently analyzed by letz & kantz @xcite in term of an indicator similar to the fsle ( i.e. able to quantify the growth rate of non infinitesimal perturbations ) .",
    "this indicator turns out to be negative for infinitesimal perturbations and becomes positive for finite perturbations .",
    "this means that a finite perturbation of sufficient amplitude can propagate along the system due to nonlinear effects .",
    "this confirms what was previously observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for marginally stable systems .",
    "= 8.truecm = 6truecm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable ] we show the behavior of a quantity @xmath184 similar to @xmath37 which has been obtained as follows .",
    "we considered two trajectories at an initial distance @xmath23 , after one time step evolution the distance @xmath55 between the trajectory is measured .",
    "then one of the two trajectory is rescaled at a distance @xmath23 from the other , keeping the direction of the perturbation unchanged , and the procedure is repeated several times and for several values of @xmath23 .",

    "this is nothing but the usual algorithm for computing the maximal lyapunov exponent  @xcite .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite this method suffers of the problem that when @xmath23 is finite one is not sure to sample correctly the measure on the statistically stationary state .",
    "indeed a finite perturbation will generically bring the trajectory out from the `` attractor '' .",
    "nevertheless the result is in good agreement with the one obtained in @xcite and confirms that at the origin of the perturbation propagation in this system there should be a mechanism very similar to the one discussed for the shift map .",
    "further studies related to the `` stable chaos '' phenomenon have been recently performed  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation evolution in spatially distributed systems can be described as the motion of an interface separating perturbed from unperturbed regions . in this spirit",
    ", one can wonder if and to what extent it is possible to draw an analogy between the evolution of this kind of interface and the propagation of fronts connecting steady states in reaction diffusion systems . as already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two phenomena display many similarities . in the following",
    "we will discuss the similarities and differences , in particular we will introduce a simple phenomenological model which can help us in highlighting the analogies .",
    "let us start by recalling the basic features of fronts propagation in reaction diffusion systems with reference to the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite @xmath187 where @xmath188 represents the concentration of a reactants which diffuses and reacts , the chemical kinetics is given by @xmath189 .",
    "typically the function @xmath190 $ ] ( with @xmath191 ) exhibits one stable ( @xmath192 ) and one unstable ( @xmath193 ) fixed point .",
    "once the system is prepared on the stable state ( @xmath194 ) , an initial ( sufficiently steep ) perturbation ( e.g. a step function @xmath195 ) will give rise to a smooth front moving with a velocity @xmath0 , that will connect the unstable and the stable fixed points : as a result the stable state will invade the unstable one .",
    "this equation admits many different traveling solutions that are typically characterized by their propagation velocities , however for a sufficiently steep initial perturbation of the unstable state the selected front is unique and its velocity @xmath0 is bounded in the interval @xmath196 $ ] , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 if @xmath189 is concave @xmath199 is attained at @xmath193 ( i.e. @xmath200 ) and the selected velocity is always the minimum one : the front is `` pulled '' by the growth of infinitesimal perturbations of the unstable state .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath189 is convex one can observe a velocity @xmath201 : the front is now `` pushed '' by the growth of finite amplitude perturbations .",
    "these results are known as the aronson & weinberger theorem @xcite ( for more details see ref .",
    "the velocity @xmath202 can be easily obtained by performing a linear analysis of ( [ eq : kpp ] ) and by employing a marginal stability criterion @xcite .",
    "the subject of our analysis is the spreading of perturbations in a chaotic media . in order to compare our case with the fkpp ,",
    "one we should consider the time evolution of the difference of two chaotic trajectories @xmath203 .",
    "however , the nature of the two phases separated by the front is now different from the fkpp case .",
    "the interface separates an unstable ( @xmath204 ) state from a `` statistically stable '' one . with",
    "the term `` statistically stable '' we mean that behind the front , in the bulk of the perturbed region , @xmath88 does not converge to a stable fixed point ( as for the fkpp ) but it fluctuates in a stationary way around an average value .",
    "this suggests that a good model for reproducing this dynamical evolution would be a fkpp with a stochastic kinetics  @xcite .",
    "however , many similarities with fkpp can be established by neglecting the chaotic fluctuations and considering the average shape of the front @xcite . in practice , this can be done by averaging the perturbation evolution over many different initial conditions .",
    "once the chaotic fluctuations are neglected , one can express the average perturbation growth in any site of the chain via the following mean - field approximation : @xmath205\\ , \\tilde{u}_i(t)\\ , , \\label{eq : model}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , @xmath46 are the discrete space and time indices and @xmath206 . here , @xmath207 indicates the `` average '' @xmath88 and @xmath208 the corresponding fsle ( at least for positive growth rates ) . in the limit @xmath209 @xmath210 , while , for @xmath211 , @xmath208 should reflect the saturation effects associated to the nonlinear map . in the infinitesimal limit ( @xmath212 )",

    "( [ eq : model ] ) is @xmath216 which is nothing but ( [ eq : kpp ] ) with @xmath217 and @xmath101 . as a consequence of the identity ( [ eq : mapping ] ) , one should observe a pulled dynamics for the chaotic front if @xmath218 , and a pushed one could occur only if @xmath219 .",
    "this can be considered as a reformulation of the aronson & weinberger theorem @xcite in the context of information propagation .",
    "the velocity bounds ( [ eq : vmin ] ) , ( [ eq : vmax ] ) can be now identified with @xmath220 , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : velocity ] ) , the first one and with @xmath221 the second one .",
    "we stress again that the lower velocity bound is indeed represented by @xmath1 and that it coincides with @xmath222 only for sufficiently strong diffusive coupling @xmath104 .",
    "another interesting point that we can investigate via a numerical simulation of the mean field effective equation ( [ eq : model ] ) is the dependence of the propagation properties on the specific shape of @xmath208 .",
    "for instance , as previously conjectured , we expect that if a monotonous decreasing @xmath208 is considered one should observe linear propagation , only .",

    "for what concerns the actual value of the selected velocity , this will depend on the value of the diffusive coupling and on the specific shape of @xmath208 . in the following",
    "we will examine the dependence of @xmath0 on two quantities that characterize @xmath208 : the difference @xmath229 and the scale @xmath138 at which the non linear effects set in .",
    "as a first example let us consider @xmath208 as a step function : @xmath230 where @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath231 are positive quantities , with @xmath232 , while @xmath138 and @xmath62 are amplitude thresholds .",
    "the parameter @xmath224 is nothing but the lyapunov exponent , @xmath225 mimics the non linear terms leading to an enhancement of the growth rate , and the last term mimics the damping of the perturbation due to the saturation effects . in fig .",

    "is evident that if @xmath233 then @xmath234 ( i.e. we are in the linear regime ) , while as soon as @xmath232 an increase of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath222 is observed .",

    "it is quite obvious that modeling the dynamics via the eqs .",

    "@xmath237 is assumed , therefore by varying @xmath138 the extension of the amplitude interval over which the nonlinear mechanism is active will not be modified ( being fixed to @xmath238 ) .",
    "but also in this second case @xmath239 for increasing @xmath138 , this indicates that the smaller are the perturbation amplitudes affected by the nonlinear mechanisms the stronger will be the nonlinear effect on the velocity : @xmath240 for @xmath241 .",
    "typically , in generic cml s by varying a control parameter both the difference @xmath229 as well as @xmath138 will change . moreover ,",
    "even the definition of @xmath138 for a continuous @xmath94 is not obvious . in order to understand the validity of the mean - field approximation ( [ eq : mod1 ] ) in a more realistic case",
    "we consider the shift map .",

    "in this paper information ( error ) propagation in extended chaotic systems has been studied in details . in particular , we have analyzed the relevance of linear and nonlinear mechanisms for the propagation phenomena in spatio - temporal chaotic coupled map lattices .",
    "linear stability analysis is not always able to fully characterize disturbance propagation .",
    "this is particularly true for ( marginally ) stable systems with strong nonlinearities , where finite size perturbations are responsible for information spreading in the system .",

    "a necessary condition for the occurrence of information spreading induced by nonlinear mechanisms has been expressed in terms of the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) .",
    "we have also shown the existence of strong analogies between error propagation and front propagation in reaction - diffusion models .",

    "these results can be of some interest for the synchronization and the control of extended systems .",
    "it has been recently shown that the synchronization of coupled extended systems is strongly influenced by nonlinear effects .",
    "in particular , the synchronization time exponentially diverges with the system size , even in non - chaotic situations , provided that @xmath243 @xcite .",
    "we believe that in these systems the appropriate indicator to characterize such transition would be the `` transverse '' lyapunov exponent  @xcite , once extended to finite scales .",
