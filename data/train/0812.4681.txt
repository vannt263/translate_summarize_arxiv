    "holm equation was introduced in  @xcite in the form @xmath1 and was intensively explored afterwards ( see , for example , refs .",
    "its superizations were also constructed , see  @xcite . since   is not an evolution equation , its integrability properties ( existence and even definition of hamiltonian structures , conservation laws , etc . ) are not standard to establish .",
    "one of the ways widely used to overcome this difficulty is to introduce a new unknown  @xmath2 and transform eq .   to the system @xmath3 which has _ almost _ evolutionary form .",
    "we stress this `` almost '' , because the second equation in   ( that can be considered as a constrain to the first one ) disrupts the picture and , at best , necessitates to invert the operator  @xmath4 . at worst , dealing with eq .   as with an evolution equation",
    "may lead to fallacious results .    in our approach based on the geometrical framework exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat the equation at hand as a submanifold in the manifold of infinite jets and consider two natural extensions of this equation , cf .  with ref  @xcite . the first one is called the _ @xmath5_-covering and serves the role of the tangent bundle .",
    "the second extension , @xmath6-covering , is the counterpart to the cotangent bundle .",
    "the key property of these extensions is that the spaces of their nonlocal ( in the sense of  @xcite ) symmetries and cosymmetries contain all essential integrability invariants of the initial equation .",
    "the efficiency of the method was tested for a number of problems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and we apply it to the camassa  holm equation here .    in section  [ sec : underlying - theory ] we briefly expose the necessary definition and facts .",
    "section  [ sec : matrix - version ] contains computations for the camassa ",
    "holm equation in its matrix version ( computations and results are more compact in this representation ) , while in section  [ sec : scalar - version ] we reformulate them for the original form   and compare later the results obtained for the two alternative presentations .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains discussion of the results obtained . throughout our exposition",
    "we use a very stimulating conceptual parallel between categories of smooth manifolds and differential equations proposed initially by a.m.  vinogradov and in its modern form presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "another example : any vector field ( differential @xmath7-form ) on  @xmath10 may be treated as a function on  @xmath13 ( on  @xmath14 ) .",
    "hence , to any symmetry ( cosymmetry ) there corresponds a conservation law on the space of the @xmath6-covering ( @xmath5-covering ) .",
    "this leads to the notions of nonlocal vectors and forms that , in turn , provide a basis to construct weakly nonlocal structures ( see subsections  [ sec : nonlocal - forms-1 ] and  [ sec : nonlocal - vectors-1 ] ) .",
    "of course , these parallels are not completely straightforward ( in technical aspects , especially ) , but extremely enlightening and fruitful .",
    "the idea of this paper arose in the discussions one of the authors had with volodya roubtsov in 2007 .",
