    "@xmath204\\times [ n , n+m]$ ] is a mixed cell of area @xmath205 .",

    "for instance , in the subdivision of example 1 , let @xmath216 be the edge of @xmath107 corresponding to @xmath217 .",
    "since @xmath216 has height @xmath218 , the two mixed cells in example 1 involving this edge give the following polygons of the same area : @xmath219    in general , comparing part ( d ) to the formulas at the end of section  [ recursion ] , we see that @xmath211 is the degree of @xmath220 for @xmath221 .",
    "it follows that @xmath222 are minding s numbers @xmath173 .",
    "thus ( a)(d ) imply that @xmath223 so that minding s formula indeed gives the mixed area .",
    "here is an example more complicated than minding s : @xmath224 note that @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 . as noted above",
    ", the right - hand side of our illustration above shows how we can calculate the area of an entire `` strip '' of mixed cells as the area of a single parallelogram .",
    "@xmath194    in general , the connections between algebraic geometry and combinatorics are very deep . in our context , this can be made into a `` mantra '' of sorts : any algorithm for computing mixed area yields a proof of bernstein s theorem in the plane , and vice - versa .",
    "minding s formula reduces to the bkk bound only when we make certain assumptions on the coefficients . on the other hand , minding s formula is without qualification a special case of the following result due to li and wang :    @xcite the number of isolated roots in @xmath228 of a system of polynomial equations @xmath229 is no more than @xmath230 where , for all @xmath215 , @xmath231 is the convex hull of the union of the origin and the newton polytope of @xmath232 .",
    "@xmath194    note in particular that one need not assume that the polynomials have a nonzero constant term or that their exponents satisfy any restriction . that li and wang s result holds for generic coefficients ( assuming that all the polynomials have nonzero constant term ) follows easily from the bkk bound , so the theorem is interesting because it states an upper bound which is true regardless of degeneracies or the presence of constant terms .",
    "however , this brings to mind an important question :  how much genericity is necessary for the bkk bound to hold ? from bernstein s seminal paper @xcite , it is easy to show that it suffices to have all coefficients corresponding to newton polytope vertices be generic . that one could get away with less genericity appears to have been first observed in @xcite , and a complete characterization of which sets of coefficients need to be generic ( for the bkk bound , the li - wang bound , and even more general bounds ) appears in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although he refrains from explicitly stating a clear characterization of which coefficients should be chosen generically , minding did appear to understand that not all coefficients need to be generic for his formula to be true",
