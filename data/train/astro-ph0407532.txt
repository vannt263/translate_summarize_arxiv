    "in work carried out over past years , we have studied dispersion forces  @xcite ( i.e. van der waals type forces ) exerted among macroscopic bulk matter mediated by light(or massless ) particle exchange , both in vacuo  @xcite and in a heat bath  @xcite .",
    "known examples are the casimir - polder forces  @xcite among neutral atoms ( where the exchanged particles are photons ) or the feinberg - sucher two - neutrino exchange forces  @xcite among baryonic matter .",
    "because real matter sits in the cosmic microwave background and in the relict neutrino background , those forces are affected by the photon thermal background and the neutrino background , respectively  @xcite .",
    "now , scalar particles are fundamental ingredients of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) and completions thereof",
    ". known examples are , higgs bosons , axions , majorons , scalars appearing in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , dilatons , radions , etc .",
    "hence , when coupled to ordinary matter , their exchange leads also to dispersion - like forces  @xcite .",
    "scalar particles , such as the axion , have been considered in the past as candidates for the dark matter in the universe .",
    "while the favorite candidates for the dark matter in the universe are weakly interacting particles with masses in the @xmath0 range ( wimps ) , the most popular example of this being the lightest supersymmetric particle ( in particular , the neutralino )  @xcite , it can not of course be excluded that a scalar ( even one not given in the list above ) is actually the real ingredient of dark matter  @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it has been recently proposed that the observed @xmath1 emission from the galactic bulge  @xcite could be the product of very light annihilating scalar dark matter particles  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the putative forces caused by the double exchange of such scalars would be also affected by the presence of the scalar dark matter .",
    "when two scalar particles are exchanged in the t - channel , spin - independent dispersion forces are being generated that add coherently over unpolarized bulk matter and extend over distances on the order of the compton wavelength of the mediating scalars .",
    "if the fundamental coupling of these scalars to matter fermions is of the usual yukawa type , then the long distance behavior of the associated potential in vacuum is specifically of the form @xmath2  @xcite . when the bodies subject to those forces are embedded in a heat bath made of the same scalars , a very dramatic effect takes place provided the scalar particles carry a conserved charge and the boson gas reservoir is characterized by a nonzero chemical potential .",
    "namely , the finite range potential ( now behaving as @xmath3 ) becomes infinitely ranged when the heat reservoir suffers bose - einstein condensation .",
    "specifically , an @xmath3 potential turns into @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , when the heat bath makes the transition to the uncondensed phase , this infinite range force becomes finite ranged .",
    "the phenomenon , first described in ref  @xcite  ( see also  @xcite ) , comes about as a combination of kinematics ( three - momentum exchange of the matter system with the medium ) and the collective effect of condensation of charge . in this paper",
    "we wish to explore a physical realization of this effect .",
    "our purpose is to display a system where the phenomenon is of physical import . since our primary goal is to investigate the implementation and physical consequences of bose - einstein condensation of a relativistic scalar gas itself , we will not focus on any specific particle physics model ( see e.g.  @xcite for the effects on the standard model particle dispersion relations ) nor claim that the envisaged cosmological arena is a realistic one either .",
    "we consider it as a convenient playground for testing the potentialities of a model characterized by matter in a light scalar heat bath",
    ".    on the other hand , one should be open minded as to which is the actual nature of dark matter and consider other options as long as wimps are not experimentally detected  ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent accounts of the status of particle dark matter ) .",
    "following the progress of experiments in measuring the cosmological parameters , the so - called @xmath5 cdm scenario has emerged as the _ standard _ cosmological scenario  @xcite suggesting that most of the energy density of the universe is stored in a dark sector , @xmath6 of which , dubbed dark energy , has negative pressure and the rest is composed by pressureless dark matter  ( although see  @xcite for alternative fits to the experimental data ) .",
    "the simplest alternatives are a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , to explain the recent period of accelerated expansion and wimps for the dark matter , but other candidates have been put forward that usually entail a richer structure in the dark sector .",
    "to name just a few , dynamically evolving scalar fields are at the basis of quintessence models for the dark energy  @xcite , condensates may play a significant role in many cosmological phenomena  @xcite and provide a unified description of dark energy and dark matter  @xcite , also long range forces in the dark matter sector motivated by string theory have been examined in  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the bose - einstein condensate of scalar dark matter particles and analytically study their influence on the peak structure of the cmb .",
    "a numerical example is next discussed in section  [ sec : numeric ] before ending with our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusio ] .",
    "let us start by displaying the model .",
    "we assume the existence of light scalars that carry a conserved quantum number q. these scalars constitute the bulk of dark matter . for a relativistic boson gas  @xcite",
    ", i.e. @xmath7 , condensation occurs below @xmath8 for a fixed charge density @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , for given @xmath10 , when the charge density exceeds @xmath11 , bose - einstein condensation follows .",
    "now , in an expanding universe number densities vary with @xmath12 and hence there should be a period in the history of the early universe where a condensed phase of scalars coexists with a gaseous scalar phase : for a sufficiently high temperature , the charge density exceeds @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the scalars , while they are in a condensed phase , are a pressureless fluid and thus constitute cold dark matter . in order that structure formation can proceed as usual , we certainly want the scalar background to be in the condensed phase at matter - radiation equality and beyond , and the eventual transition to an uncondensed phase to take place not before the large scale structures we observe today have had enough time to form .",
    "we shall see below how these conditions can be met .",
    "we suppose next that our scalars couple to ordinary baryons via the effective interaction @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nucleon mass , arbitrarily chosen to make the effective coupling @xmath16 dimensionless . it may be viewed as the low energy limit of the interaction shown in figure  [ fig : feyn ] involving the fundamental underlying yukawa interaction , with strength @xmath17 , of the scalars to heavy fermions associated to a high energy scale m. the dimensionless coupling @xmath16 can be understood as @xmath18 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) leads , via the exchange of two scalars depicted in figure  [ fig : feyn2 ] , to the asymptotic potential ( i.e. @xmath19 ) @xmath20 between two static matter fermions sitting in a scalar heat bath at temperature @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bose - einstein condensation temperature  @xcite .     to ordinary baryons @xmath23 . ]        below @xmath22 , i.e. in the condensed phase , the resulting potential reads  @xcite , @xmath24    the effective interaction  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) is the simplest form describing the exchange of two scalars among baryons .",
    "other forms , like e. g. derivative couplings appropriate for goldstone bosons , would result in a different @xmath25 behaviour  @xcite of the potentials  ( [ eq : potyuk ] )  and  ( [ eq : potcond ] ) , but the transition to a long range interaction below @xmath22 , with the removal of the exponential damping factor , remains unaffected",
    ".    having mentioned goldstone bosons , let us , at this point , note that there is an interesting parallel between spontaneous symmetry breaking and bose - einstein condensation : both types of systems possess bosonic fields which acquire a constant classical component .",
    "this parallel is not exact , however , since the physics of how these constant classical components arise is different ( see e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the noninteracting charged scalar field can not exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking , but it does show the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation and this is indeed the process that occurs in our setting .",
    "the scalars that are exchanged in figure  [ fig : feyn2 ] are _ not _ goldstone bosons ( note e. g. that they have a non - zero mass ) .",
    "linear couplings are the simplest alternative to describe their interaction with the baryons , and thus our choice in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .      because of this long range dispersion force between baryons , the euler equation for baryonic matter in the tightly coupled photon - baryon fluid gets an extra body force term @xmath26 ( in fourier space",
    "; k is the wave - number associated to a sub - horizon sized scale ) where the potential @xmath27 obeys the poisson equation : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and where @xmath30 is the scale factor , the subscript @xmath31 refers to `` today '' , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the baryon energy density and density contrast , respectively .    combined with the continuity equation for the photon temperature fluctuation @xmath34 one obtains the oscillator equation responsible for the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of the cmb : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the gravitational potentials associated to dark matter and @xmath38 .",
    "the derivatives are with respect to conformal time @xmath39 .",
    "the key difference with the usual acoustic equation  @xcite is the `` speed of sound '' .",
    "indeed , instead of the proper velocity of sound @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 where , @xmath42 as in the usual case , the equation can be solved very accurately with the help of the wkb approximation .",
    "the phase of the oscillations is given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 i.e. the effective sound horizon .",
    "modes that verify @xmath45 at recombination are caught at maxima ( compression ) or minima ( rarefaction ) of their oscillation and render the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum . since multipole moments @xmath46 approximately , @xmath47 where @xmath48 . as a consequence of the infinite - range interaction ,",
    "the @xmath49-position of the peaks will be shifted ( except the first one , see below ) .",
    "treating @xmath50 in equation  ( [ eq : fase ] ) as a small perturbation we find : @xmath51 note that the above integral starts at @xmath52 , which is the time at which the @xmath53-mode enters the horizon . from this moment",
    "onwards , the causal interaction mediated by @xmath54-exchange is operative .",
    "the integrand depends on time because the speed of sound changes with time but also because the parameter @xmath50 depends on the critical temperature @xmath22 which decreases as the universe expands .",
    "the integral is easily done analytically but the explicit expression is cumbersome . if we work it out a little bit by introducing its numerical value at recombination , we obtain : @xmath55 \\left({0.1ev\\over m_\\phi}\\right)^2\\left({\\omega_bh^2\\over 0.02}\\right)\\left({\\omega_{dm}h^2\\over 0.14}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation  ( [ eq : deltas ] ) we used the value @xmath56 and for @xmath57 we shall use @xmath58 which is adequate for scales that enter the horizon after matter - radiation equality .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : deltas ] ) evaluated at the first peak ( i.e. @xmath59 ) vanishes .",
    "it is rightly so , because the first peak corresponds to a scale that entered the horizon just before recombination and therefore the dispersion force has had no time to operate .",
    "higher harmonics , that correspond to smaller scales and hence had more time to oscillate , give positive shifts ( towards larger @xmath49 s ) because our force effectively reduces the sound horizon .",
    "finally and obviously , the higher the multipole , the larger the shift .",
    "the height and location of the acoustic peaks depends on the parameters of the working cosmological model .",
    "for instance , the location of the first peak strongly favors a flat universe with a less than critical baryon density and , combined with the existence of the second peak , one has an estimate of the total cold dark matter density  @xcite .",
    "modifications of the cosmological model will show up , thus , in the peak structure , and constraints on such variations can be obtained by means of numerical likelihood analysis . for example , the speed of sound of the dark energy is @xmath60 in models with noncanonical kinetic energy density , such as @xmath61 essence , and densities of the order of @xmath62 can be distinguished from models whose sound speed is near the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "theories of neutrino mass generation can lead to a uniform shift of the peaks to larger @xmath49 and an enhanced damping due to a delayed matter - radiation equality  @xcite .    as we do not want to endeavor a full analysis of the allowed parameter space in our model , for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we take the uncertainty in the second peak position to be @xmath63 .",
    "this figure provides an order of magnitude estimate of present and planned experiments ability to reconstruct the cmb power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "then the third peak moves by a @xmath64 . from equation  ( [ eq : deltas ] )",
    "we infer that these variations follow for an arbitrarily chosen scalar mass @xmath65and for a coupling @xmath66 , which is a very small number .",
    "let us now check the self - consistency of the picture when we adopt this value for @xmath16 .",
    "the scalar boson gas is made of particles with @xmath67 @xmath68-charge , which we denote by @xmath69 , and anti - particles with @xmath70 @xmath68-charge denoted by @xmath71 . to easy notation , however , we shall display the charge sign only when strictly necessary .",
    "let the net total charge be positive ( this is purely conventional ) and therefore there is an excess of particles @xmath69 over antiparticles @xmath71 in the universe .",
    "at the very early epochs of the universe , say at @xmath72 , when the degrees of freedom associated to the high energy scale m ( e.g. fermions @xmath73 with charge q in figure  [ fig : feyn ] ) are fully relativistic , our scalars are in thermal contact with all relativistic species , the density is very high , and the gas of scalars is condensed with most of the charge sitting in the condensate .",
    "the condensed phase consists overwhelmingly of particles @xmath69 of zero momentum .",
    "they are the bulk of dark matter .",
    "since charge @xmath68 in any co - moving volume is conserved , the charge density @xmath9 is bound to be : @xmath74 although charge in excited states is a smallish fraction @xmath75 of the charge in the condensed phase , the number density of scalars and anti - scalars occupying excited states is comparable to the other relativistic species at those large temperatures .",
    "later on , when temperature has dropped below the energy scale m , and consequently q - fermions are extinct , our scalars might still interact with baryons through elastic @xmath76-scattering ( @xmath77 stands for nucleon ) where the @xmath78-interaction rate @xmath79 contains the properly averaged cross section @xmath80 relative velocity :    @xmath81    in this expression @xmath82 is the spin averaged transition matrix element squared and we have included the spontaneous plus stimulated emission factor @xmath83 , where @xmath84^{-1}$ ] is the bose - einstein distribution function ( @xmath85 being the chemical potential ) .",
    "this factor weighs the population of final particle phase space in a boson medium .",
    "the calculation of the interaction rate for thermal scalars ( i.e. those with nonzero momentum ) gives a value , at @xmath86 , comparable to the hubble expansion rate but drops precipitously beyond @xmath87 annihilation due to the massive loss of scatterers .",
    "the calculation of the interaction rate for the zero momentum scalars in the condensate is not as straightforward .    indeed ,",
    "the final scalar phase space integral in the previous equation does not properly account for the sum over states in the condensed regime .",
    "the zero modes are not included in the sum .",
    "this is not a problem in the non - degenerate case because charge is thinly distributed over the states and the ground state gets only an infinitesimal share of the total charge .",
    "however , in a condensed bose - einstein gas a macroscopic fraction of the charge sits in the ground state . in our case",
    ", the ground state is populated essentially by particles @xmath69 .",
    "actually , the integral ( evaluated at fixed chemical potential @xmath88 ) gives then the contribution of the excited states to the phase space .",
    "we shall estimate the stimulated emission contribution to the interaction rate to be :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is explicitly given by is a reminder that we are summing only over excited final states ] : @xmath91 where we have omitted the spontaneous emission term which in this case is negligible compared to the stimulated emission term , and the fraction @xmath92 of the total number of particles over the particles in excited states can be approximated by : @xmath93}{\\zeta ( 3)t^3/\\pi ^2}\\ ] ] in equation  ( [ eq : sigmastar ] ) we took into account that the rates are to be evaluated in a co - moving frame at rest with respect to the hubble flux . in this frame",
    "the scalars in the condensate are motionless and the baryons are non - relativistic in the relevant temperature span ( @xmath86 and below ) .",
    "the energy - momentum deltas can be used to crack down the phase space integrals and to obtain a much simpler expression that reads : @xmath94 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 and z is the cosine of the `` laboratory '' scattering angle .",
    "the kinematics of the scattering process corresponds to an extremely glancing collision as required by energy - momentum conservation and the delta function in equation  ( [ eq : sigmacrack ] ) describes approximately the fact that @xmath97 . in equation  ( [ eq : sigmacrack ] ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are fixed by energy - momentum conservation : @xmath100 and    @xmath101    collecting the different pieces and introducing them in equation  ( [ eq : sigmacrack ] ) , we obtain : @xmath102 where we used @xmath103 as dictated by the equipartition theorem .",
    "we get the final form for the interaction rate of scalars in the condensate by plugging the equation above into equation  ( [ eq : gammastim ] ) where the factor @xmath92 is about @xmath104 in this temperature regime ( @xmath86 and below ) . even below anti - baryon extinction , when the baryon number density @xmath105 is @xmath106 , the resulting rate is many orders of magnitude larger than the hubble rate : @xmath107 hence , while thermal scalars are already decoupled at temperatures below or about @xmath108 , the zero modes in the scalar condensate are in full thermal contact with the cosmic plasma .",
    "though decoupled , thermal scalars keep their equilibrium distributions with momenta redshifting as the universe expands .",
    "and hence they keep a common temperature with the condensate bosons that are tightly coupled to baryons and photons .",
    "a common temperature is maintained only until anti - baryon extinction takes place .",
    "by then photons are reheated with respect to thermal scalars and the condensate , still coupled to the baryon - photon fluid , shares its temperature .",
    "actually the zero modes in the condensate keep in thermal contact with the baryons well beyond matter - radiation equality ( see below ) .",
    "a further widening of the temperature gap between thermal scalars on the one hand and photons and the condensate on the other hand occurs at two more stages : after @xmath109 and later after @xmath110 annihilation .",
    "hence at nucleosynthesis the ratio of temperatures is : @xmath111 since the effective number of degrees of freedom associated to the thermal scalars at nucleosynthesis is proportional to this fraction to the fourth power , there is clearly no conflict with primordial helium yields  @xcite .",
    "we turn next to the question as to when does the condensate loose thermal contact with the baryon - photon plasma .    in a matter dominated universe",
    "the expansion rate is given by : @xmath112 @xmath113 being the non - relativistic matter density .",
    "decoupling of the particles in the boson condensate from the baryon - photon fluid happens when their interaction rate roughly equals the cosmic expansion rate .",
    "actual numerical comparison of both rates renders : @xmath114 this is a rough estimate that determines the moment of condensate decoupling to happen about a factor @xmath115 below the recombination temperature .",
    "here we took into account that scalars in the condensate and thermal scalars do not share the same temperature at these later stages .",
    "indeed , in this temperature regime we replaced @xmath116 for @xmath10 in equation  ( [ eq : sigmastarv ] ) , we used @xmath117 , and we related both @xmath10 and @xmath116 via equation  ( [ eq : reldof ] ) .",
    "the charge density at decoupling is still about a factor of five above critical .",
    "so the transition to an uncondensed phase is yet to happen .",
    "however , since scalars are non - interacting and thermally isolated from ordinary matter ever since decoupling took place , scalars will maintain the equilibrium distributions they had at decoupling .",
    "the zero modes , i.e. the condensate , will therefore keep in the lowest energy state beyond the critical point because no interaction can pump them out of the ground state . as a consequence , baryons in the cosmic scalar background today , i.e. at zero redshift , should feel the long - range two body exchange forces under scrutiny .",
    "they are extremely feeble .",
    "in fact , being proportional to the present cosmic q - charge density and to @xmath118 ( see equation  ( [ eq : potcond ] ) ) , they turn out to be almost a million times weaker than the force of gravity .",
    "hence for this particular numerical example , they would go unnoticed by local gravity experiments  @xcite , although , in general , couplings between the dark and the visible sectors can have observable consequences on structure formation  @xcite .",
    "we have entertained the possibility that the dark matter is composed by a bose - einstein condensate of light scalar particles coupled to the baryonic component of the universe .",
    "the long - range forces among baryons caused by the pair exchange of dark matter particles in the presence of the condensate gives rise to a shift in the position of the acoustic peaks in cmb power spectrum above the first one .",
    "for a particular choice of the parameters in our model , a consistent cosmic evolution results that would show up as variations in the peak locations of the order of a few percent .",
    "since our primary aim was to display the consequences of bose - einstein condensation of a relativistic scalar gas in a physical setting , we do not find it justified to exhaustively explore the full @xmath119 parameter space .",
    "other choices of the parameters could lead to a completely different , and even inconsistent , cosmic evolution .",
    "for example , the transition to a non - condensed phase could take place before the thermal decoupling , and we would be left with light scalar dark matter particles thinly populating the states above the ground state with no trace of the primordial condensate before structure formation occurs .",
    "also , tests of the gravitational inverse - square law  @xcite or casimir force measurements  @xcite , could be sensitive to parts of the @xmath119 parameter space different from the ones studied .    in the particular case considered , we find that the particles in the condensate will remain in the lowest energy state beyond the critical point . once decoupled , the particles in the condensate are in practice isolated from the ones in the thermally excited states and momentum redshifting can not cause any flow between this two populations .",
