    "the putative stripped gas is embedded in group gas , so the extracted spectrum likely contains multiple temperature components .",
    "unfortunately , the current data do not allow us to constrain such two - temperature gas models , as was done in su & irwin ( 2013 ) for a sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "thus , the current @xmath6 0.5 z@xmath95 abundance result should be taken as a lower limit to the hot gas metallicity of the enhanced region .",

    "inspection of archived _ two micron all sky survey _",
    "( _ 2mass _ ) images revealed no infrared counterpart anywhere within the enhanced region . since _",
    "2mass _ has a detection limit of @xmath103=14.3 , this implies that a putative background galaxy should be further than @xmath104 mpc to be undetected . at this distance ,",
    "the enhanced region would have a physical radius of 300 kpc , too small for typical clusters but comparable to some small groups . to test whether the enhanced region could be a galaxy group at this distance , we fit its x - ray spectrum to an apec thermal emission model with a redshift of 0.24 ( @xmath105 mpc ) .",

    "there are several possibilities for the presence of this hot arc .",
    "first , this is a cool core system ; such systems generally have temperature profiles rising from the center out to 0.10.3 virial radii , then declining outward , tracing the gravitational well ( see vikhlinin et al .",

    "2009 for cool - core groups ) . in this scenario",

    "the upper limit of @xmath237 @xmath7 that we determined with the hot gaseous x - ray emission is half that estimated by romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , although their uncertainty is as large as a factor of two .",
    "our results suggest that ngc  1407 is _ not _ an unusually dark system , with a group @xmath9 that is comparable to that of fornax group ( @xmath238 @xmath239 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "another important observable is the baryon mass fraction .",
    "we determined an enclosed baryon mass fraction of 0.06 within 100 kpc for this group , which is much larger than previously determined by romanowsky et al .",
    "this value is still smaller than the cosmological value of @xmath240 , but comparable to other galaxy groups with similar temperatures ( dai et al .",
    "thus , this baryon deficit is not unusual for groups .",
    "however , galaxy groups as a population do tend to have smaller baryon fractions than clusters ( dai et al .",
    "one explanation is that galaxy groups have shallower gravitational potentials , making them more vulnerable to agn feedback and/or galactic winds .",
    "thus , their atmospheres may have been redistributed to large radii ( beyond @xmath235 ) .",
    "there are a number of _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory studies of clusters reaching @xmath241 .",
    "in contrast , there are only a few such studies of galaxy groups to comparable radii , due to their relatively lower x - ray surface brightness . thus far , there are three such investigations involving poor clusters : hydra a ( 3.0 kev ; sato et al .",
    "2012 ) , rxj1159 + 5531 ( 2.0 kev ; humphrey et al .",
    "2012 ) and eso 3060170 ( 2.7 kev ; su et al .",
    "the enclosed baryon mass fractions in these systems are 0.23 , 0.17 and 0.13 , respectively .",
    "the surprisingly high value of hydra a ( higher than cosmic ) may result from its total mass being underestimated , due to non - thermal pressure support at large radii .",
    "the observations of rxj1159 + 5531 are consistent with theoretical predictions , with no baryons missing .",
    "baryons may have been lost from eso 3060170 , likely due to central feedback .",
    "we speculate that the diversity of gas properties at @xmath241 should be larger among galaxy groups than galaxy clusters .",
    "note that if ngc  1400 were not present , the ngc  1407 group would qualify as a fossil group , which is defined as a group with a central dominant galaxy at least two magnitudes brighter in @xmath242-band than the second brightest galaxy within half a virial radius ( jones et al .",
    "it has been debated whether fossil groups are the end results of galaxy mergers within groups or are instead a transitional stage .",
    "our study indicates that ngc  1400 , as a newly infalling galaxy , only temporarily disqualifies the ngc  1407 group as a fossil group .",
    "this is consistent with some simulation work that shows that the gap between the brightest and the second brightest galaxy may be intermittently filled over time by newly infalling galaxies ( von benda - beckmann et al .",
    "group / cluster scaling relations ( such as x - ray luminosity  temperature ) show that fossil groups lie between groups and clusters in many of their properties ( khosroshahi et al .  2007 ; miller et al .",
    "thus , we speculate that fossil groups may be a transient phase as groups evolve into clusters in the hierarchical universe .",
    "this also sheds light on the puzzling fact that a large fraction of fossil groups lack cool cores , although they are usually thought to be highly evolved , undisturbed systems ( dupke et al .",
    "we anticipate that recent mergers , as exhibited in the ngc  1407/1400 complex , may inhibit the monotonic growth of cool cores in many fossil groups .",
    "the ngc  1407 group has been a subject of interest and debate due to the large radial velocity ( 1200 km  s@xmath0 ) of its second brightest galaxy , ngc  1400 , relative to the central dominant galaxy ngc  1407 .",
    "this has lead to unusually large mass - to - light ratio estimates and suggestions that the ngc  1407 group is one of the darkest known galactic systems . in this paper , we presented our investigation of the ngc  1407/1400 complex with joint _ xmm - newton_/_chandra _ observations .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :    \\1 .",
    "a region of enhanced x - ray surface brightness just east of ngc  1400 is likely to be a tail of hot gas stripped from the ism of ngc  1400 .",
    "the metallicity of the stripped gas is @xmath6 0.5 @xmath86 , larger than the metallicity of the group gas ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "the deduced tail length is @xmath163 kpc .",
    "we studied the conditions for ram pressure stripping for ngc  1400 . to have the gas in the enhanced region",
    "stripped from ngc  1400 s ism , the galaxy needs to have a relative velocity of at least 1275 kms@xmath0 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the possible velocity range ( 12001500 kms@xmath0 ) we estimated for ngc  1400 through other methods using pressure jumps and the gravitational potential .",
    "no obvious shock feature was found in this system , which may be a consequence of ngc  1400 moving nearly in the line of sight .",
    "\\3 . with an _ xmm - newton _ pointing on the ( relatively relaxed ) eastern side of ngc  1407",
    ", we derived a hydrostatic mass for this group of @xmath244 within 100 kpc .",
    "the total mass extrapolated to the virial radius ( 681 kpc ) is 3.75@xmath140 .",
    "this provides an upper limit for the mass to light ratio of @xmath245 @xmath79 ( @xmath238 @xmath7 ) within the virial radius .",
    "we thus conclude that ngc  1407 group is _ not _ an unusually dark group .",
    "we speculate that ngc  1400 recently entered the ngc  1407 group .",
    "the presence of ngc  1400 within half a group virial radius of ngc 1407 currently ( but temporarily ) disqualifies ngc  1407 from being classified as a fossil group .",
    "this suggests that some fossil groups may be in a transient stage , rather than the secular end - result of galaxy mergers within groups .",
