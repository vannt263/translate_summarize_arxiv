    "quantum field theory method including renormalization group ( rg ) approach has been successfully used for the theoretical explanation of various phenomena in developed turbulence ( see @xcite and wherein references ) .    in this paper the quantum field model of helical mhd",
    "is investigated . as a starting point",
    "we consider the navier - stokes equation for the velocity field and the equation for magnetic field which are driven by gaussian random forces with a given @xmath0 matrix @xmath1 of the hydrodynamic , magnetic and mixed noise correlators , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) the multiplicative renormalizability of the quantum field model of non - helical mhd turbulence has been proved and the rg approach has been applied to study the asymptotic behavior of the model considered .",
    "the existence of two infrared - stable fixed points has been established .",
    "these points govern the two critical regimes : the magnetic regime and the kinetic one ( the later being of the kolmogorov type ) .",
    "the critical properties of the helical mhd are not known in the case of an arbitrary noise matrix @xmath1 . to provide the multiplicative renormalizability and consequent application of rg it is necessary to extend the theory adding the extra dissipative terms with new helical prandtl numbers @xcite .",
    "therefore , also a critical behavior of the helical mhd is more complicated . a priori",
    ", the existence of the former stable regime of the kolmogorov type is not clear . in the following the existence of the critical regimes mentioned above for ordinary mhd",
    "is demonstrated for the helical one .",
    "there is an additional problem in the helical mhd : the instability of the theory which is induced by the exponential increase of the magnetic fluctuations in the large scales range ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the elimination of this instability leads to formation of a large - scale magnetic field known as the turbulent dynamo .",
    "removal of the instability in quantum field formulation of helical mhd can be achieved by means of a nice and very well known spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism followed by the creation of homogeneous stationary magnetic field .",
    "the special case , when only the hydrodynamic noise does not vanish , was analyzed in @xcite .    in this paper the value of spontaneous magnetic field @xmath2 in one loop approximation for matrix @xmath1 of noises in generic form .",
    "this value has been found from the conditions of overall exponential instabilities elimination in the steady state .",
    "the dynamo mechanism is accompanied by the appearance of an `` exotic '' term in the linearized equation for magnetic field .",
    "this term causes the linear growth in time @xmath3 of the amplitudes of alfvn waves for small wave vectors @xmath4 in the direction orthogonal to the plane of @xmath4 and @xmath2 . due to the viscosity terms",
    "this growth is transformed into long - lived pulses of the type @xmath5 with small @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "the interaction of electrically neutral conductive turbulent incompressible fluid with the magnetic field with the magnetic field is described by the stochastically forced mhd equations @xcite : @xmath8 together with the incompressibility conditions @xmath9 the first equation is the well - known navier - stokes equation for the divergence free velocity field @xmath10 with the additional nonlinear contribution of the lorentz force ( p is a sum of both hydrodynamic and magnetic pressure per unit mass ) . the second equation for magnetic field @xmath11 ( it is connected with magnetic induction @xmath12 by the relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fluid density and @xmath15 is its magnetic permeability ) follows from the maxwell equations for continuous medium . the magnetic diffusion coefficient @xmath16 is connected with the coefficient of molecular viscosity by relation @xmath17 with dimensionless magnetic prandtl number ( pn ) @xmath18 .",
    "external random forces @xmath19 are assumed to have a gaussian distribution with @xmath20 and they are defined by @xmath21 matrix of the noise correlators @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix elements are : the hydrodynamic @xmath23 noise , the magnetic @xmath24 one and the mixed @xmath25 one .",
    "the problem ( [ ns ] ) is equivalent to a quantum theory with the doubled number of the fields @xmath26 and the action functional @xcite : @xmath27 + { \\bf b } ' [ -\\partial_t{\\bf b}+u_0\\nu_0\\delta{\\bf b}- ( { \\bf v}\\partial){\\bf b}+({\\bf b}\\partial){\\bf v}]\\ , , \\label{zd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 are some auxiliary vector fields .",
    "hereafter in the similar expressions , the integration over @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the traces over the vector indices are implied .",
    "as it is usual in qft , the action ( [ zd ] ) is considered to be unrenormalized with the bare constants marked by the subscript @xmath31 the basic objects of the study are the green functions of the fields @xmath32 ( the correlation functions and response functions in the terminology of the original problem ( [ ns ] ) ) .",
    "they can be determined as functional derivatives with respect to an external sources @xmath33 of the generating functional @xmath34 $ ] , i.e. , they are the functional averaged values of the corresponding number of the fields @xmath35 with a weight @xmath36 $ ] . here , @xmath37 denotes the functional measure of the integration over the fields @xmath32 with all normalization coefficients .",
    "we have to choose a concrete form of @xmath1 in the wave vector - frequency @xmath38 representation .",
    "the noises are transversal for the incompressible fluid . the action for helical mhd can possess scalar terms as well as pseudoscalar ones .",
    "hence , the tensor structure of all noises is a linear combination of both tensor and pseudotensor .",
    "then the correlators have the form : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stands for transverse projector and @xmath42 is levi - civita pseudotensor .",
    "dimensionless real parameters @xmath43 satisfy the conditions @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the scalar parts of the noises explicitly written in ( [ ks ] ) are in a standard power form @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 play the role of the bare coupling constants , and @xmath47 are free parameters of the model .",
    "the value @xmath48 corresponds to the kolmogorov energy pumping from infrared region of the small @xmath4 .",
    "in a standard way , one can solve the primary infrared problem for the physical value @xmath48 by the transfer to the region of small values @xmath49 , where the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences appear .",
    "they can be eliminated by the addition of the appropriate counterterms to the action ( [ zd ] ) @xcite .",
    "the counterterms are formed of the superficial uv divergences , which are present in one - particle irreducible green functions @xcite .",
    "the following 1-pi green functions possess the uv divergences : @xmath50 .",
    "corresponding diagrams are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 and counterterms have the form : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the last two of them are not present in the primary action ( [ zd ] ) .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to consider the extended theory with the additional cross dissipative terms @xmath56 , @xmath57 and helical magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath58 , @xmath59 . besides uv divergences mentioned above which manifest themselves like the poles of @xmath49 ( @xmath60uv divergences ) , another divergences proportional to the uv cutoff @xmath61 can appear in the green functions @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "they acquire the form of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 these @xmath70 divergences generate the instability of the model , which causes exponential growth in time of the corresponding response functions .",
    "therefore , their direct insertion into the action ( [ zd ] ) is not allowed and one has to find an effective way to eliminate them .",
    "one can make a natural assumption that finally the energy of the unstable large scale magnetic fluctuations must be transformed into the energy of large scale mean magnetic field .",
    "epsf    the model of the helical mhd under consideration describes steady state , therefore it is reasonable to consider the new vacuum state with zero mean values of fields @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and non - vanishing time - independent mean field @xmath74    epsf    in a quantum field theory the appearance of non - zero vacuum value of field is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , and as a standard , the value itself is determined from requirement of minimum of potential energy at the tree level . in the case considered here the situation is more complicated and rather technically different , because unstable @xmath61-terms appear at the next ( one - loop ) level , consequently , the nonvanishing value of mean magnetic field in the steady state must be calculated in this order of a perturbation scheme . by straightforward calculations and/or from the symmetry analysis of the given one - loop feynman diagrams , one can find that only @xmath75 contains @xmath76terms . here",
    "all @xmath76 divergences can be eliminated by means of the shift of @xmath77 namely @xmath78 , and , on the other hand , @xmath60uv divergences are compensated by means of five independent renormalization constants @xmath79 in extended model of helical mhd . as a result one obtains model with renormalized action : @xmath80 - \\label{action1 } \\\\ & & { \\bf b^{\\prime}}[\\partial_t { \\bf b}-z_2 u \\nu \\triangle { \\bf b}- z_5 w \\nu \\triangle { \\bf v } + ( { \\bf v}\\partial){\\bf b}- ( { \\bf b}\\partial){\\bf v}- ( { \\bf c}\\partial){\\bf v } ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all parameters are renormalized couterparts of bare ones . the action ( [ action1 ] ) generates green functions without divergences . in this case feynman rules have the following form @xmath81 where @xmath82 with @xmath83 and vertices are defined by the expressions : @xmath84 where @xmath85 using feynman rules defined above one can immediately calculate the diagrams which are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 . to extract the @xmath76 terms",
    "it is enough to keep only linear in wave vector part of the diagrams .",
    "the response functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 do not possess any linear divergent terms .",
    "@xmath61-divergent part and term @xmath89 of the response function @xmath90 at the one - loop level are of the form : @xmath91 , \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 . from requirement of vanishing of @xmath76term in ( [ sigma ] )",
    "one determines the value of spontaneous field @xmath97 one can see from this equation that magnitude of spontaneous field is independent of coupling constants @xmath98 , which characterize an intensity of random noises , and helical parameters @xmath99 . in such a way we obtain the renormalized green functions which are finite as @xmath100 formally , as it is usual in the field theory .",
    "but in real problems a natural maximal cutoff exists . in the developed turbulence the kolmogorov dissipative length @xmath101 plays the role of a minimal scale .",
    "this length can be expressed in terms of basic phenomenological parameters - viscosity @xmath102 and energy dissipation rate @xmath103 ; @xmath104 .",
    "then from ( [ pole ] ) one obtains @xmath105 and it determines the order of magnitude of the spontaneous field @xmath2 .",
    "in order to understand the role of the last term in ( [ sigma ] ) let us consider the linearized mhd equations which follow from ( [ action1 ] ) in infrared limit of small wave vector @xmath4 : @xmath106 ( { \\bf b } \\cdot { \\bf e } )   \\ , .",

    "therefore , the last term in ( [ sigma ] ) results in the appearance of specific long - lived pulses of alfvn waves .",
    "they are orthogonal polarized with respect to the spontaneous field and try to restore the isotropy broken by them .",
    "after successful elimination of all uv divergences we can use the renormalization group procedure and arrive to the set of rg gell - mann - low equations for five invariant charges : @xmath127 where @xmath128 ( @xmath129 is scale setting parameter ) .",
    "rg @xmath130-functions are expressed via renormalization constants @xmath131 which have been calculated in one - loop approximation .",
    "note that the @xmath130-functions are finite in the limit of @xmath132    the gell - mann - low equations ( [ gle ] ) have been solved numerically for the various initial values of the invariant charges @xmath133 .",
    "it provides the possibility to analyze the attracting regions of infrared fixed points .",
    "there are two infrared - stable fixed points : the gaussian @xmath134 and nontrivial @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "the latter provides the existence of asymptotic critical regime of the kolmogorov type .",
    "the rg approach improves expressions of simple perturbation theory and leads to the replacement of the original charges by the invariant ones , and , in critical regime by their values at the corresponding fixed points . keeping in mind that @xmath2 is connected with magnetic induction @xmath138 by the relation @xmath139 ( remember that @xmath140 denotes density and @xmath15-permeability of fluid ) in above asymptotic region the magnitude of mean spontaneous magnetic induction is equal to @xmath141 .",
    "in the paper the correlation and response functions of velocity and magnetic fluctuations have been studied .",
    "generally , these functions possess singularities , which can be eliminated by a proper renormalization procedure . as a result ,",
    "rg equations have been obtained and their solution have been found in the range of small wave numbers .",
    "this solution corresponds to the famous kolmogorov scaling law . in helical mhd , where mirror symmetry of the system under consideration is stochastically broken ,",
    "the non - vanishing mean magnetic field is spontaneously generated .",
    "this phenomena is accompanied by the linear growth in time @xmath3 of the amplitudes of alfvn waves for small wave vectors . due to the viscosity terms",
    "this growth is transformed into long - lived pulses of the type @xmath142 with small @xmath6 and @xmath130 .",
