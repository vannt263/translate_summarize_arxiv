    "one of the most important issues in modern astrophysics is understanding the co - evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ( smbh ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews on the subject ) .",
    "both numerical simulations and theoretical arguments show that black hole ( bh ) growth occurs during short - lived periods ( @xmath3yr ) of intensive accretion which are also associated with powerful _",
    "activity @xcite .",
    "these are also expected to correspond to periods in which galaxies grow hierarchically .",
    "since the matter that ultimately accretes onto the central black hole needs to lose almost all ( @xmath4 ) of its angular momentum , studies of mergers , tidal interactions , stellar bars and disk instabilities are central for understanding the details of such a process .",
    "numerical simulations and analytic calculations have shown that major ( gas - rich ) mergers are capable of efficiently driving gas inflows towards the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath5 ) through tidal forces ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ultimately drive the gas to the central @xmath6 , forming an accretion disk around the central smbh @xcite .",
    "this is also thought to be a likely scenario for the formation of galaxy spheroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , disk instabilities and minor mergers may also be able to provide material for black hole accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is extremely important to study the connection between galaxy and black hole growth from a purely observational point of view .",
    "one of the central questions is whether mergers or other mechanisms may constitute the main triggering mechanisms for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "a number of recent papers investigated this issue using data from different surveys of galaxies and agns .",
    "results are often contradictory .",
    "although it is known that not all of them are agns , powerful ultra  luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) are ubiquitously associated with major mergers @xcite . according to some models ( e.g",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) these objects are believed to represent a fundamental stage in the process of the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that for a sample of @xmath7 ulirgs in the goods - south field @xcite , the fraction of mergers is up to @xmath8 . for lower luminosities objects ( lirgs ) in the same redshift",
    "range the merger fraction found by the same authors is significantly smaller ( @xmath9 ) .    while the merger ",
    "ulirg connection seems to be well established , whether this is a viable scenario for all agns is still an unanswered question .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of 20 relatively nearby qsos with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and found that the majority of them reside in merging galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied the optical counterparts of the x - ray selected agns from the 1msec chandra deep field south @xcite .",
    "based on both the asymmetry index and the frequency of close companions , these authors concluded that mergers and interactions are not good indicators of agn activity .",
    "interestingly , using hst images taken with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) @xcite showed that only a small fraction of heavily obscured qso hosts are associated with mergers .",
    "@xcite put together a relatively large sample of literature data and found clues for a luminosity dependence of the merger fraction in both ulirgs and agns . on the other hand , @xcite showed that their sample of qsos observed with hst did not show any evidence for a dependence of the merger fraction on luminosity .",
    "recently , based on a sample of sdss galaxies , @xcite found that the effect of interactions is minimal in triggering agn activity .",
    "a major issue is related to the so - called radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy of active nuclei .",
    "it has been long argued that in order to produce powerful relativistic jets , radio - loud agns must possess an extra source of energy with respect to radio  quiet agns .",
    "the most popular scenarios among those proposed so far assume that the energy may be extracted from the innermost region of a magnetized accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "in the blandford - znajek framework , the radio - quiet / radio - loud dichotomy can be explained in terms of a corresponding low / high black hole spin separation @xcite .",
    "alternative models predict that jets are directly powered by the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "both theoretical arguments and observational evidence support the blandford - znajek scenario ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent numerical simulations also seem to confirm such a mechanism as a viable physical explanation for efficient jet production ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite originally proposed that radio  loud agns are associated with rapidly spinning black holes that are ultimately spun - up by major bh - bh mergers .",
    "it is clear that a straightforward prediction of such a scenario is that radio galaxies and radio - loud qsos ( rlqsos ) should exhibit signatures of major galaxy mergers .",
    "radio  loud agns are known to be hosted by large elliptical galaxies and are associated with smbh of at least @xmath10 m@xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these objects are present in richer environments ( clusters and groups of galaxies ) than radio quiet agns @xcite and they are often associated with brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "at least a fraction of them have been known to be associated with merging system for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite studied samples of relatively low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) sources with deep ground based observations . these authors found that the large majority ( @xmath13 ) of radio - loud objects show disturbed morphologies .",
    "the same group also studied a small sample of radio  quiet type  2 quasars @xcite and found that the merger fraction sample is as high as 75% .",
    "however , an accurate census of the merger fraction in carefully selected samples of agns over a large range of redshift , luminosity and radio  loudness is still needed to provide a final answer to the above questions .",
    "this should also be based on a homogeneous set of deep , high spatial resolution observations and supported by firm statistical evidence for any difference in the observed merger fractions amongst the different samples .",
    "the aim of this paper is to make a significant step towards such a goal .    with the aim of determining the importance of mergers in triggering different types of agn activity , we select samples of both radio  loud and radio  quiet type  2 agn . in this paper",
    "we focus on type  2 objects only , because the bright nuclear component that dominates the emission on type  1 agns ( qsos ) hampers a detailed morphological study of both the host galaxies and the close environment of those objects .",
    "this constitutes a serious concern , particularly at moderate to high redshifts , even using hst images . in this work we focus on objects with @xmath14",
    "this is a range of redshift where the peak of the agn activity is believed to occur , and where mergers play a dramatic role in the late evolution of massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the availability of hst data for a substantial number of objects in each sample is key to this work .",
    "in particular , we focus on samples observed with wfc3 and the ir channel . the extremely high sensitivity , low background level and the range of wavelengths covered by such an instrument is particularly suitable to our goals .",
    "in fact , the rest frame wavelength corresponding to the most widely used wfc3ir filters ( i.e. f140w and f160w ) is still well within the optical range for objects in the redshift range of our interest . even in relatively short exposures ( i.e. a few hundreds seconds , or less than 1 hst orbit )",
    "the effects of merger events on the structure of galaxies are clearly revealed in wfc3ir images .",
    "this is possible thanks to the high sensitivity in the near ir coupled with the large field of view of wfc3 , compared to previous generation instruments such as wfpc2 , nicmos and acs .    in sect .",

    "for the magnitude system , we use ab magnitudes .",
    "one fundamental goal of this work is to establish whether there is a significant difference in the role played by mergers among different classes of agns and for different bins of redshift and bolometric power . to this aim",
    ", we use well defined samples of classical radio galaxies spanning 5 dex in radio power .",
    "we also select new samples of both radio quiet and radio loud agns , as well as non - active galaxies at @xmath0 . in doing so",
    ", we use particular care in separating the radio quiet and radio loud populations , as explained below .    in the following",
    "we describe the properties of each of the samples used as part of this work , together with the selection criteria used to derive new samples .      the first sample we consider is composed by the radio galaxies with @xmath0 from the 3cr catalog @xcite .",
    "these are all powerful radio galaxies belonging to the fanaroff ",

    "* ) , i.e. those in which the brightest components of the radio structure lie at the edges of the radio source , in contrast to the fr  is , in which the peak of the radio emission is located at the core .    the 3cr is a flux limited sample selected at low radio frequencies ( s@xmath19 jy at 178mhz ) . since the radio emission at such frequencies",
    "is dominated by the radio lobes , the selection is independent of the agn orientation .",
    "the original catalog includes both type  1 ( qsos ) and type  2 objects ( radio galaxies ) and it is one of the best studied samples of radio loud agns , being perfectly suitable to test agn unification scenarios .",
    "the high redshift objects included in the 3cr are all firmly established radio loud agns with powerful relativistic jets emanating from the central supermassive black hole . even at the lowest luminosities ,",
    "the active nucleus is strongly radio loud ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming the canonical threshold @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fluxes in the radio band at 5 ghz and in the optical b band , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 sub - sample of the 3cr catalog includes 58 objects .",
    "the highest redshift object is the radio galaxy 3c257 at @xmath23 .",
    "the radio power of these agns is @xmath24 erg @xmath25 hz@xmath18 or slightly higher , which corresponds to a bolometric luminosity @xmath26 erg s@xmath18 assuming standard bolometric corrections .",
    "this result is also supported by the estimates of the x - ray luminosity for some of these objects , which is typically in the range @xmath27 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of the most luminous and most distant radio galaxies and qsos from the 3cr catalog with _",
    "xmm_. they found that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity is in the range @xmath28 erg s@xmath18 , the type  1 qsos being a factor of @xmath29 or higher brighter than the ( type  2 ) radio galaxies .",
    "these authors interpreted such a discrepancy as a result of the presence of a beamed component in the type  1 qsos .",
    "@xcite found similar results based on chandra data .",
    "torresi et al .",
    "( priv . comm . ) analyzed both chandra and xmm archival data for the 3cr radio galaxies observed with hst , and found intrinsic x - ray luminosities as low as @xmath30 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "however , the absorbing column density is poorly constrained , and it is possible that at least some of the type  2 radio galaxies are in fact compton - thick . in that case , the derived x - ray luminosity sets a lower limit to the intrinsic agn luminosity in that band .",
    "twelve 3cr radio galaxies were observed with wfc3ir and the f140w filter ( in addition to wfc3-uvis and f606w , not used in this work ) as part of program snap13023 ( pi m. chiaberge , hilbert et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the wide - band filter used for the hst observations ( f140w ) includes emission lines at the redshift considered here ( mainly h@xmath31 , h@xmath32 and/or [ oiii]5007 , depending on the redshift of the source ) .",
    "however , the only object that is significantly contaminated by line emission is 3c  230 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hst image of this specific object only shows the narrow - line region and thus we can not observe the stellar component of the host .",
    "therefore we exclude this source from our samplem ) , therefore the expected emission line contamination is small .",
    "in fact , for all radio galaxies except for 3c  230 , we estimate that , based on the observed emission line flux from ground based spectra , the total emission line contamination does not exceed  20% of the total observed flux ( hilbert et al .",

    "hst snapshot surveys of complete samples are well suitable for statistical studies , since the observations are scheduled by randomly picking objects from the original target list to fill gaps in the hst schedule . the observed sample spans the entire range of redshift of the original list , i.e. from @xmath33 to 2.47 .",
    "the comparison samples described in the following are tailored to match the properties of these 3cr galaxies , in either bolometric power or redshift range ( or both ) .    in tab .",

    "the sample of high redshift low - luminosity radio galaxies ( hzllrgs ) is derived from the extended _ chandra _ deep field south ( ecdfs * ? ? ?",
    "we use the @xcite catalog and agn type classification to derive this sample .",

    "* iii ) * the source must be classified as a radio loud agn by @xcite , i.e. it must show radio emission in excess of that produced by starbursts .",
    "this is measured by using the @xmath37 parameter , defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the observed flux density at 24@xmath34 m and @xmath40 is the observed flux density at 1.4ghz .",
    "@xcite define an object as radio loud if @xmath41 is 2@xmath42 off of the starburst locus , defined using the m82 template ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "* iv ) * we also impose the additional constraint that its x  ray luminosity must not exceed @xmath43 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "this is to ensure that the objects are consistent with typical low power radio galaxies at both low and high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the upper limit to the x  ray luminosity is also consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the radio loud ",
    "radio quiet dichotomy can be redefined using the x  ray emission instead of the flux in the optical band .",
    "this is particularly useful for type  2 agns such as the ones considered in this work , since the optical emission form the accretion disk is heavily obscured in these object . according to such a scheme , powerful radio loud agns are present for r@xmath44 , where r@xmath45 is defined as the logarithm of the ratio between the radio luminosity ( @xmath46l@xmath47 ) at 1.4ghz and the x - ray luminosity l@xmath48 . at low radio powers , it is easy to confuse a powerful radio quiet agn that shows some radio emission with a radio loud object that is intrinsically weak at all wavelengths . note that our selection criteria for the radio and x - ray luminosities correspond to r@xmath49 , which is a rather conservative value .",
    "we prefer to follow a conservative approach because for low luminosity agns the transition between radio  quiet and radio  loud most likely occurs at higher values than for high power objects , similarly to the classical radio  loudness parameter r derived using the radio - to - optical luminosity ratio @xcite .",
    "* v ) * the source must be observed with hst wfc3ir .",
    "most of the images are taken from the candels survey @xcite , or from surrounding fields observed as part of program go-12866 ( see table  [ hzllrgtab ] ) .",

    "the binomial probability of obtaining 12 mergers out of 12 observed is extremely small ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , when objects are randomly drawn from a sample without replacement , the hypergeometric distribution must be used instead of the binomial . in that case , the probability of obtaining 12 mergers out of 12 observed , from a population of 58 objects in which 50% of the objects are mergers is @xmath89 . note that if the merger fraction in the complete sample is higher than 72% , then the ( hypergeometric ) probability of obtaining 12 mergers is @xmath90 .",

    "however , that would have the effect of lowering the actual number of sources in our sample , and that in turn would lower the probability of the hypergeometric distribution .    therefore , we conclude that even if the number of 3cr galaxies observed at @xmath0 is small , the probability that the observed merger fraction is overestimated because of any selection bias is extremely small .      in this section",
    "we discuss the results we obtained for the different radio loud samples .",
    "it is in fact particularly interesting to investigate whether the merger fraction in these object may depend on e.g. redshift , luminosity , or on the original criteria for each sample selection .",
    "however , while the statistical analysis clearly shows that radio loud objects are almost all associated with mergers , one important _ caveat _ is that the samples are small .",
    "this is particularly true for the radio - loud samples ( except for the low - z 3cr ) , but also for the high - z radio - quiet comparison sample .",
    "unfortunately , this prevents us from drawing statistically firm conclusions on any possible trends between the different samples of radio galaxies .",
    "for example , we can not determine whether the hzllrg s are less likely to be associated with mergers than the hz3c s even if the observed fraction is lower in the former than in the latter .",

    "this is reasonable considering the uncertainties in the x - ray luminosity and the range of radio and x - ray luminosity spanned by the objects .",
    "this plot summarizes the main result of this work , i.e. that radio quiet sources are systematically associated to smaller merger fractions ( and they are located in the lower - left side of the figure ) , while radio loud agn are unambiguously associated with mergers ( and they are located in the upper - right side of the figure ) .",
    "our results basically agree with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those studies focus on samples of relatively low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) sources with deep ground based observations .",
    "these authors found that the large majority ( @xmath13 ) of radio - loud objects show disturbed morphologies , and they also reside in dense environments .",
    "however , the parameter space covered by those papers is limited to luminous low - redshift objects , while our work spans a significantly larger range both in redshift and luminosity .",
    "the same group also studied a sample of 20 type  2 quasars @xcite that includes at least two rlqsos , based on their location in the l@xmath99 v l@xmath100}$ ] plane @xcite .",
    "as expected in light of our results , both rlqsos are associated with mergers .",
    "the merger fraction in the full sample is as high as 75% .",
    "if we only exclude those two sources that exceed their definition of radio - loudness , the observed merger fraction among the remaining radio - quiet objects is still quite large ( 72% ) . while this might appear in disagreement with our measured fraction for the rqagns , the uncertainty on the value found by these authors is large , as a result of the small number statistics ( 13 possible mergers out of 18 objects ) .",
    "since the samples are small , we can not reject the null hypothesis that a 72% merger fraction for that sample is different from the fraction measured in our sample of rqagns .",
    "one of the major points here is that we showed that there is no evidence for a trend with luminosity , at least for the radio loud samples .",
    "this is apparently at odds with the results of @xcite , where only the most powerful samples appear to predominantly reside in merging systems .",
    "however , it is interesting to briefly discuss their work in the light of our results .",
    "two samples show a significantly greater merger fraction than any other samples treated in that work .",
    "those are the sample of dust - reddened type  1 qsos of @xcite and the @xcite sample of type  1 qsos .",
    "the former is most likely biased in favor of a high merger fraction , because of the nature of those obscured quasars .",
    "the latter , instead , is more interesting .",
    "of the 20 qsos observed with hst by @xcite , 14 are radio quiet and 6 are radio loud .",
    "all of the 6 rlqsos are apparently merging or show irregular features that might be explained with a merger , in agreement with our results .",
    "thus if we only limit the analysis to the rqqsos , the fraction of mergers is @xmath76 , in agreement with our findings .",
    "therefore , we argue that the high fraction of mergers in the full bahcall sample ( 65% ) could in principle be explained , in light of our results , by the fact that a significant fraction of the objects are radio loud .",
    "our results show that radio galaxies are unambiguously associated with mergers , independently of redshift and luminosity , while radio - quiet agn at @xmath0 are indistinguishable from normal galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "this result may have profound implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that enable the production of powerful relativistic jets from supermassive bhs .",
    "in fact , such a strong connection between mergers and radio loud agns may be a clue for a direct link between these two phenomena .",
    "the central question here is whether mergers may provide , or at least substantially contribute to the physical conditions that ultimately enable the formation of jets in rlagns .",
    "first of all , we should point out that most mergers do not generate a rlagn .",
    "this is clear from the fact that a fraction of non - active galaxies at @xmath0 are seen to be merging , but they show no signs of radio - loud activity . if there is an association between these two phenomena , it is not a univocal cause / effect relationship .",
    "based on our results , the same also holds for radio - quiet agns since a fraction of those are associated with mergers .",
    "thus , we conclude that mergers are unrelated to radio - quiet agns or , alternatively , only a fraction of those may be triggered by mergers",
    ". however , it is worth noting that our definition of merger includes objects that still have to merge as well as objects for which the signs of a past merger are somehow still visible .",
    "therefore , the timescale during which we observe a merger is probably of the order of at least @xmath86 1 - 2 gyr ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the time scale for radio loud activity is most likely significantly shorter ( @xmath101 yr ) .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude that some of the non - active galaxies that we observe in a merger phase are turned - off radio loud agns , or , alternatively , they still have to be turned - on . summarizing , we believe that not all mergers may directly generate a radio - loud agn . below",
    "we discuss a few possible conditions for a merger to trigger rlagn activity .",
    "we argue that when certain conditions are met , mergers may trigger radio loud nuclear activity .",
    "what we ultimately wish to know is what those conditions are .",
    "an important piece of information here is that the association between mergers and rlagns is robustly established at all redshifts . while both recent simulations and observations show that the galaxies merger rate increases with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results show that there is no evidence that the merger fraction for rlagn is higher at higher @xmath102 .",
    "of course , this should be confirmed through the analysis of larger samples that may better constrain the merger fractions and highlight any possible trends with redshift .",
    "but even if the uncertainties remain large with the present samples , the existence of such a tight relationship between the two phenomena means that somehow a rlagn needs a merger ( at all redshifts ) in order to manifest itself .",
    "the predominance of major mergers among our radio loud samples ( at least at @xmath0 ) that is apparent from visual inspection needs to be confirmed through a more quantitative analysis .",
    "however , this may imply that one of the conditions that must be met in order to trigger a rlagn is that the merger needs to be between two galaxies ( and thus between two bhs ) of similar mass .",
    "it is well known that radio galaxies are ubiquitously associated with very massive hosts ( @xmath103 m@xmath11 , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and high - mass smbh ( @xmath104 m@xmath11 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we expect those major mergers to involve high mass objects only .      understanding the details of this issue is central to our future work on the subject , but it is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". however , we can build on our results and speculate on a possible scenario .",
    "one of the effects of mergers is to lower the specific angular momentum of the gas in the galaxy , and thus to drive the gas towards the center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while this may naturally happen in gas rich mergers , as those observed in our high - z 3cr sample ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hosts of low redshift radio galaxies ( in particular those of low radio powers ) are often relatively gas  poor systems .",
    "therefore , this effect may play a role at higher redshifts , but it is very unlikely to be the ultimate cause of radio loud activity in general .",
    "furthermore , tidal effects happen in all mergers , thus merger events should affect both rq and rl agns at the same level , contrary to our results .",
    "another effect of mergers is to alter the spin and the mass of the central black hole . that can be achieved in two ways , i.e. either via accretion , or via bh - bh merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the former implies that a large amount of gas is driven toward the central region of the galaxy , for a significant amount of time .",
    "if the accretion of matter is coherent , i.e. if the flow of matter occurs at a fixed angular momentum axis , that ultimate leads to spinning - up the black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "if accretion results from multiple merger events that drive the matter towards the black hole from different directions , the bh is spinned - down . in any case , as already pointed out above , the expected amount of gas in major mergers ( at least at low redshifts ) is probably too small to alter the bh spin significantly in these objects .    in the case of bh - bh merger ,",
    "the two bh coalesce and the resulting object has increased mass and , in most cases , a lower spin per unit mass .",
    "but there are scenarios in which those events lead to the opposite result .",
    "for example , it has been shown that a single major bh - bh merger , where the ratio between the masses of the two involved bhs approaches unity , may generate a spinning bh , even if the two merging black hole are initially not spinning ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . however , current simulations are unable to reproduce bh with dimensionless spin parameter greater than @xmath105 as a result of bh - bh mergers alone @xcite .",
    "according to the so - called _ spin paradigm _ @xcite , radio loud agns are associated with rapidly spinning black holes , while bhs in radio quiet agn are expected to spin less rapidly .",
    "those major mergers that result in rapidly spinning black holes may provide the link between our observations and the physics behind the rlagn phenomenon as a whole .",
    "clearly , the objects that we are seeing in a pre - merger phase , or the very few ones that are associated with a minor merger , do not fit the above scheme . in those cases",
    ", we must assume that another major merger event happened in the recent past .",
    "this does not seem unreasonable , since all of these objects lie in over - dense environments , but it should be proven by finding the signatures of that previous merger .    in a framework in which bhs are spun up by major bh - bh mergers , we expect a range of resulting spin values . therefore , it is possible that different radio morphologies ( and radio powers ) are associated with different bh spin levels .",
    "for example , only the bhs that spin more rapidly might be able to produce the most relativistic jets , in a framework in which the jet is powered by energy extracted from the rotating black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such a scenario has been explored for x - ray binaries jets , so far leading to contrasting results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite were able to reproduce the rl and rq agn populations in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "their model is based on a scheme that includes a bimodal bh spin distribution mainly caused by the the combination of accretion of matter onto the black hole and by the different type of mergers that galaxies of different stellar mass undergo .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , black holes could also be spun - up by merger - triggered accretion .",
    "such a mechanism could in principle account for our observations of mergers at @xmath0 , but only if those are gas - rich mergers .",
    "however , it would not completely explain the origin of radio - loud activity in low redshift , gas - poor galaxies ( see also the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "a scenario in which bh - bh mergers are directly implied in triggering radio loud agn activity seems to be supported by the observed properties of low - redshift rlagn hosts .",
    "@xcite showed that all radio loud agns in their samples are hosted by core - galaxies , i.e. galaxies that show a flat radial brightness profile in the central regions . while this analysis is clearly limited to very low redshifts ( @xmath106 ) , where the core radius can be resolved in hst images , and to objects that are not affected by significant amounts of dust in the central kiloparsecs",
    ", it very clearly shows that there is a strong connection between the presence of a _ core _ profile and rl activity .",
    "interestingly , one of the most likely explanations for the presence of core profiles is related to a major bh - bh mergers , in which the binary bh formed during the merger ejects stars from the central regions before the two bhs coalesce ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the direct physical connection between such a phenomenon and radio loud activity is still a matter of debate ( see e.g. *",
    "* ) , it provides one more piece of evidence that major mergers and radio loud agns are strictly connected .",
    "we derived the merger fraction in samples of @xmath0 type  2 rlagn , type  2 rqagn , and non- active galaxies .",
    "we establish that the rlagn are unambiguously associated with mergers ( 92%@xmath1 ) , while only 38%@xmath2 of the rqagn show evidence for a merger . non - active galaxies are statistically indistinguishable from the rqagns .",
    "the comparison with lower redshift samples shows that there is no evidence for the fraction of mergers in rlagns to be dependent on either redshift or agn luminosity .",
    "mergers are directly involved in triggering radio - loud activity at all redshifts .",
    "we speculate that the galaxy mergers we observe at @xmath0 are responsible for spinning up central black holes possibly through mergers of high - mass bhs",
    ".    it will be extremely important to study the bh mass distribution in samples of merging galaxies of different type and to determine whether the bh mass and the merger types are related to different type of activity .",
    "not all galaxy mergers in our rl samples appear the same to visual inspection .",
    "it would be important to firmly assess the ratio between major and minor mergers at different redshifts , and radio power .",
    "the images in this work show that a larger fraction of objects are in a phase of ongoing- or post - major merger in higher redshift samples than in the lower redshift counterparts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the different hst cameras used not only sample different rest - frame wavelengths ( near - ir at low - z and optical at @xmath107 ) , but they also have significantly different sensitivities .",
    "it is extremely hard to detect post - merger signatures such as e.g. faint tidal tails in the intermediate redshift samples imaged with wfpc2 .",
    "those features may lie outside the field of view in the nicmos images at low redshift .",
    "the only redshift range that is covered with homogeneous observations is between z=1 and 2.5 .",
    "clearly needed is a homogeneous data set observed with hst - wfc3 or acs at all redshifts .",
    "detailed studies of the mergers in our radio - loud samples using integral field spectroscopy , combined with deep high resolution imaging in the rest frame ir , should be used to study the kinematics of the mergers and measure a range of parameters such as dynamical masses and angular momenta .",
    "the imaging part of the project is feasible with wfc3 , although at high redshifts the rest frame wavelengths sampled by such a camera are still within the optical bands .",
    "dust obscuration may reduce the accuracy of the stellar mass measurements .",
    "alma observations can trace the molecular gas involved in the mergers .",
    "it is important to study a large sample of these sources at different redshifts , to test whether different amounts of gas are driven towards the central supermassive black holes and whether that may affect the type of radio loud nuclear activity a comparison with the mergers observed in radio - quiet agns and in ulirgs will elucidate the black hole feeding mechanism in all of these sources , and relationships with agn activity .",
    "this work is limited to type  2 agns because in type  1 agns the nuclear light from the central qso hampers morphological studies of the host galaxy . with a better knowledge of the wfc3 psf ,",
    "such a study is possible starting with the sample of 3cr qsos at @xmath0 .",
    "better results can be achieved using coronographic observations by @xcite . while the coronographic mode is now available on hst only in stis , jwst with niriss will allow us to image qsos spanning a broader range of redshift .",
    "we hope to be able to study in detail both the structure and fueling mechanisms in type  1 objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in conclusion",
    ", our results clearly establish that rlagns are mergers .",
