    "the normalized colored jones polynomial @xmath1 for a knot @xmath2 and positive integer @xmath3 is a laurent polynomial in the variable @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this is defined so that @xmath6 is the ordinary jones polynomial , and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unknot . in  @xcite",
    "vu huynh and thang l showed that the colored jones polynomial of a knot @xmath2 can be described in terms of the inverse of the quantum determinant of an almost quantum matrix .",
    "this matrix comes from a braid @xmath9 whose closure is the knot @xmath2 and is formed using deformed burau matrices . in  @xcite , vaughan jones briefly mentioned a probabilistic interpretation of the burau representation as walks along the knot , and in  @xcite , xiao - song lin , feng tian , and zhenghan wang used this interpretation to generalize the burau representation to tangles by using walks along the tangles .",
    "then in  @xcite lin and wang used this to calculate the colored jones polynomial and derive a new proof of the melvin - morton conjecture . in this paper , we will use a different , but similar , generalization of this description using huynh and l s result to give a geometric interpretation of the colored jones polynomial in terms of walks along the braid @xmath9 .",
    "this interpretation will then be used to show the following theorem , which basically states that , for knots which can be written as the closure of a positive braid , the first @xmath0 leading coefficients of @xmath1 are trivial :    [ positive ] if @xmath9 is a positive braid whose closure is the knot @xmath2 , then @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of crossings in @xmath2 and @xmath16 is the number of strands in the braid @xmath9 .    in  @xcite ,",
    "abhijit champanerkar and ilya kofman prove a result similar to theorem  [ positive ] for a smaller class of knots , closures of positive braids with full twists . in their theorem",
    ", they show that this pattern of coefficients repeats multiple times using a different method",
    ".      in section  [ walks ] walks are introduced and it is shown how they are used to calculate the colored jones polynomial . in section",
    "[ qd ] we discuss huynh and l s description of the colored jones polynomial as the inverse of a quantum determinant .",
    "this is then related to walks and is used to prove that the method described in section  [ walks ] gives us the colored jones polynomial .",
    "section  [ posbraids ] gives the proof of theorem  [ positive ] .",
    "i would like to thank oliver dasbach , whose guidance made this possible , and also stavros garafoulids and thang l for their hospitality during a visit to georgia tech university , and for helpful feedback .",
    "the braid group @xmath17 is the group of braids on @xmath16 strands .",
    "the product of two braids @xmath18 is the braid formed by putting the first braid @xmath19 on top of the second @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the standard generators of @xmath17 .",
    "the closure of a braid @xmath9 is the knot or link @xmath22 formed by attaching the top of each strand to the bottom of each strand .",
    "every knot can be realized as the closure of some braid .",
    "this braid is not unique , and neither is the word in the generators of the braid group which represents that braid . in this discussion",
    "we would like to fix such a word .",
    "the sequnce @xmath23 which is described in the next paragraph gives us the means to do this .",
    "for a sequence @xmath24 of pairs @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( we will use @xmath28 interchangably as it should be clear from the context ) , let @xmath29 be the braid @xmath30 fix a @xmath23 so that the closure of @xmath31 is the knot @xmath2 . denote @xmath32 .",
    "this is the writhe of @xmath31 .",
    "begining at the bottom of the @xmath33-th strand , follow the braid along a strand until you begin to cross over another strand . at this over crossing there is a choice to either continue along the strand or jump down to the strand below and continue following along the braid .",
    "continue to the top of the braid ending at the @xmath34-th strand .",
    "the weight of the path is the product of the weights of the crossings .",
    "shortly we will give more meaning to these symbols , and then it will be immediate that for different values of @xmath34 , they all commute with each other , so the order of the product can be taken arbitrarily .",
    "however , for the same value of @xmath34 , these symbols are non - commutative , and we will see the relations between them .",
    "a walk @xmath39 along @xmath9 consists of a set @xmath40 , permutation @xmath41 of @xmath42 , and a collection of paths where there is exactly one path from @xmath34 to @xmath43 in the collection , for each @xmath44 .",
    "the weight assigned to a walk is @xmath45 times the product of the weights of the paths in the collection , where inv(@xmath41 ) is the number of inversions in the permutation , that is the number of pairs @xmath46 such that @xmath47 . here",
    "the order is important since a single value of @xmath34 can appear multiple times .",
    "the order is taken to be the same as the order of the starting positions at the bottom of the walk .",
    "an example of walks along the braid @xmath48 will follow theorem  [ coloredjones ] .",
    "note that we are reading the braid in two different directions .",
    "when writing the braid as a product of generators the braid is read from the top down .",
    "when walking along the braid it is read from the bottom up .",
    "this is important to get the order of the paths correct in the product of the weights .",
    "finally a stack of walks is an ordered collection of walks , and the weight of the stack is the product of the weights of walks in the appropriate order .",
    "we call this a stack because when considering a picture of these objects it can be thought of as simply stacking the walks on top of each other .    for a stack of walks",
    "@xmath39 , we will also consider the local weight at a crossing @xmath34 , denoted @xmath49 , which is the product of the weights of the crossing for each walk in the stack .",
    "note that with this notation we can express the weight of @xmath39 as @xmath50 , where the sum ranges over the walks in the stack and @xmath15 is the number of walks in the stack .",
    "it will be useful to talk about an ordering on the paths that make up a stack .",
    "if two paths belong to two different walks at different level of the stack , then the path in the higher walk ( that is the walk whose weight is multiplied to the left of the other ) is said to be above the other path .",
    "if the two paths are in the same walk , then the path which begins to the left of the other path is said to be above the other path .",
    "we will now give a more substantial meaning to the weights of these walks .",
    "the letters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 will be the operators defined by huynh and l in  @xcite , which will now be repeated here .",
    "this will involve introducing a few extra variables .",
    "we will eventually make simple substitutions to remove these variables .           by adding or subtracting @xmath62 in this way throughout",
    ", we can describe how the total sum will change .",
    "the original sum was @xmath63 .",
    "call the new sum @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the new term coming from crossing @xmath34 after all of the additions and subtractions are applied .",
    "if you restrict to only paths on the same walk , say the @xmath66-th walk , then the result of all of the additions and subtractions will be a change by @xmath67 .",
    "if you restrict to two different walks and consider only the @xmath68 s coming which occurs between paths on these two different levels , then all of these additions and subtractions will result in no change to the total sum .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    each of the walks themselves can be thought of as braids .",
    "the closure of these braids are links .",
    "if we stack the two links coming from these two walks the way the walks are stacked , then we can see that the additions and subtractions are just the calculation of the sum of the linking numbers of different components of these links , where the different components come from the different links .",
    "this is obviously @xmath69 since one link is entirely above the other .",
