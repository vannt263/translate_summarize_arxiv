    "the measurement of the nuclear structure function in deep inelastic electron - nucleus scattering ( dis ) is the best way to improve our knowledge of the nuclear parton distributions and qcd dynamics in the high energy regime ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "however , after more than 30 years of experimental and theoretical studies , a standard picture of nuclear modifications of structure functions and parton densities has not yet emerged .",
    "fixed target dis measurement on nuclei revealed that the ratio of nuclear to nucleon structure functions ( normalized by the atomic mass number ) is significantly different from unity . in particular , these data demonstrate an intricate behavior , with the ratio being less than one at large @xmath3 ( the emc effect ) and at small @xmath3 ( shadowing ) and larger than one for @xmath4 ( antishadowing ) .",
    "the existing data were taken at lower energies @xcite and therefore the perturbative qcd regime ( @xmath5 gev@xmath6 ) was explored only for relatively large values of the ( bjorken ) @xmath3 variable ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "experimentally , this situation will hopefully change with a future high energy electron - ion collider ( eic ) ( for recent reviews see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is supposed to take data at higher energies and explore the region of small @xmath3 ( @xmath8 ) in the perturbative qcd regime .",
    "the theory of nuclear effects in dis is still far from being concluded .",
    "the straightforward use of nucleon parton distributions evolved with dglap equations and corrected with a nuclear modification factor determined by fitting the existing data as in refs .",
    "@xcite is well justified only in the large @xmath9 region and not too small @xmath3 . moreover",
    ", these approaches do not address the fundamental problem of the origin of the nuclear shadowing and can not be extended to small @xmath3 , where we expect to see new interesting physics related to the non - linear aspects of qcd and gluon saturation ( for reviews see ref .",
    "currently , there are several phenomenological models which predict different magnitudes for the shadowing in the nuclear structure function based on distinct treatments for the multiple scatterings of the partonic component of the virtual photon , assumed in general to be a quark - antiquark ( @xmath10 ) color dipole .",
    "some works @xcite address the origin of the nuclear shadowing through the glauber - gribov formalism @xcite in the totally coherent limit ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is coherence length ) , which considers the multiple scattering of the color dipole with a nucleus made of nucleons whose binding energy is neglected . in the high energy limit , the eikonal approximation is assumed , with the dipole keeping a fixed size during the scattering process . in this approach",
    "the total photon - nucleus cross section is given by _",
    "^*a = d^2r dz |(r , z)|^2 _ da(x , r ) [ sigga ] where @xmath13 is the probability of the photon to split into a @xmath14 pair of size @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the dipole - nucleus cross section , which is expressed as @xcite _ da(x , r ) = d^2b 2 [ sigda ] with @xmath17 being the nuclear thickness function and @xmath18 is the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "it must be stressed that once @xmath18 is fixed , the extension to the nuclear case is essentially parameter free in this approach . in the glauber formula ( [ sigda ] )",
    "it is assumed that the dipole undergoes several elastic scatterings on the target .",
    "although reasonable and phenomenologically successful this assumption deserves further investigation .",
    "this model can be derived in the classical approach of the color glass condensate formalism @xcite .",
    "another approach largely used in the literature is based on the connection between nuclear shadowing and the cross section for the diffractive dissociation of the projectile @xcite , which was established long time ago by gribov @xcite .",
    "its result can be derived using reggeon calculus @xcite and the abramovsky - gribov - kancheli ( agk ) cutting rules @xcite and is a manifestation of the unitarity .",
    "this formalism can be used to calculate directly cross sections of photon - nucleus scattering for the interaction with two nucleons in terms of the diffractive photon - nucleon cross section . in this formalism",
    ", the total photon - nucleus cross section is expressed as a series containing the contribution from multiple scatterings ( 1 , 2 , @xmath19 ) : _",
    "^*a = _ ^*a^(1 ) + _ ^*a^(2 ) + _ ^*a^(3 ) + [ eq1 ] with the first term being the one that arises from independent scattering of the photon off @xmath20 nucleons : _ ^ * a^(1)=a_^*p and the first correction to the non - additivity of cross sections being _ ^ *",
    "a^(2)=-4a(a-1)d^2b  t_a^2(b ) _ m^2_^m^2_dm^2 .",
    "t=0 f_a^2(t _ ) [ sigalb ] where @xmath21 is the mass of the diffractively produced system , @xmath22 is the nucleus form factor which takes into account the coherence effects and the differential @xmath23 cross section for diffractive dissociation of the virtual photon appearing in ( [ sigalb ] ) is given by : . _",
    "t=0= x_f^(3)_2(q^2,x _ , ) [ eq3 ] where @xmath24 is the diffractive slope parameter and @xmath25 is the diffractive proton structure function .",

    "the integration limits in @xmath21 are @xmath29 gev@xmath6 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "a shortcoming of this approach is that the inclusion of the higher order rescatterings is model dependent .",
    "this resummation is specially important at small @xmath3 , where multiple scattering is more likely to happen . in general",
    "it is assumed that the intermediate states in the rescatterings have the same structure and two resummation schemes are considered : ( a ) _ the schwimmer equation _",
    "@xcite , which sums all fan diagrams with triple pomeron interactions and which is valid for the scattering of a small projectile on a large target .",

    "^ * a^s(x , r)=_^*p(x , r ) a d^2b [ schwimmer ] and ( b ) _ the eikonal unitarized cross section _ , given by ^e_^*a(x , r)=_^*p ( x , r ) a d^2b , [ eikonal ] where f(x , q^2)= _ m^2_min^m^2 _ dm^2 .",

    "as shown in @xcite , the eikonal unitarization predicts a larger magnitude for the nuclear shadowing than the schwimmer equation . for models which take into account the possibility of different intermediate states",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . except for the choice of the resummation scheme ,",
    "the predictions for @xmath32 obtained using ( [ schwimmer ] ) or ( [ eikonal ] ) are parameter free once the diffractive cross section is provided .",
    "models based on this non - perturbative regge - gribov framework are quite successful in describing existing data on inclusive and diffractive @xmath1 and @xmath33 scattering @xcite .",
    "however , they lack solid theoretical foundations within qcd .",
    "it is important to emphasize that some authors @xcite use these models as initial conditions for dglap evolution .    the comparison among the predictions of the different models for nuclear shadowing presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the models discussed above , shows that they coincide within @xmath34 in the region where experimental data exist ( @xmath35 ) but differ strongly for smaller values of @xmath3 , with the difference being almost of a factor 2 at @xmath36 .",
    "our goal in this paper is try to reduce the theoretical uncertainty present in these predictions .",
    "in particular , differently from previous studies , which consider different inputs in the calculations using the glauber , schwimmer and eikonal approaches , we will consider a unique model for the projectile - nucleon interaction .",
    "we will calculate the dipole - nucleon cross section and the diffractive structure function using the dipole picture and the solution of the running coupling balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite , which is the basic equation of the color glass condensate formalism .",
    "recently , this approach was shown to describe quite well the @xmath1 hera data for inclusive and diffractive observables ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "following this procedure we are able to estimate the magnitude of the theoretical uncertainty associated to the way the multiple scatterings are considered , reducing the contribution associated to the choice of initial conditions used in the calculations .",
    "moreover , we discuss the possibility of discriminating between these unitarization procedures in a future electron - ion collider .",

    "[ dipole ] we present a brief description of inclusive and diffrative @xmath37 - nucleon processes in the color dipole picture with particular emphasis in the dipole - proton cross section given by the color glass condensate formalism . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the predictions of the three unitarization schemes discussed above using as input the cgc results for the dipole - proton interaction and compare them with the existing experimental data .",
    "moreover , we present a comparison between the predictions for the kinematical region which will be probed in a future electron - ion collider . finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the photon - hadron interaction at high energy ( small @xmath3 ) is usually described in the infinite momentum frame of the hadron in terms of the scattering of the photon off a sea quark , which is typically emitted by the small-@xmath3 gluons in the proton . however , as already mentioned in the introduction , in order to describe inclusive and diffractive interactions and disentangle the small-@xmath3 dynamics of the hadron wavefunction , it is more adequate to consider the photon - hadron scattering in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath39 long before the interaction , which then scatters off the target @xcite .",
    "the main motivation to use this color dipole approach is that it gives a simple unified picture of inclusive and diffractive processes . in particular , in this approach the proton structure function is given in terms of the dipole - proton cross section , @xmath40 , as follows : f_2^p(x , q^2 ) = d^2r dz |(r , z)|^2 _ dp(x , r ) [ sigga ] where @xmath13 is the probability of the photon to split into a @xmath14 pair of size @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the total diffractive cross sections take the following form ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42 it is assumed that the dependence on the momentum transfer , @xmath43 , factorizes and is given by an exponential with diffractive slope @xmath24 .",
    "the diffractive processes can be analysed in more detail by studying the behaviour of the diffractive structure function @xmath44 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the diffractive structure function is given by @xmath45 where the @xmath46 contribution with longitudinal polarization is not present because it has no leading logarithm in @xmath9 .",

    "@xcite , at small @xmath56 and low @xmath9 , the leading @xmath57 terms should be resummed and the above expression should be modified .",
    "however , as a description with the same quality using the eq .",
    "( [ qqg ] ) is possible by adjusting the coupling @xcite , in what follows we will use this expression for our phenomenological studies .",
    "we use the standard notation for the variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 the total energy of the @xmath61 system .",
    "the main input for the calculations of inclusive and diffractive observables in the dipole picture is @xmath62 which is determined by the qcd dynamics at small @xmath3 . in the eikonal approximation ,",
    "it is given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the forward scattering amplitude for a dipole with size @xmath65 and impact parameter @xmath66 which can be related to the expectation value of a wilson loop @xcite .",
    "it encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function . in general",
    ", it is assumed that the impact parameter dependence of @xmath67 can be factorized as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the profile function in impact parameter space , which implies @xmath70 .",
    "the forward scattering amplitude @xmath71 can be obtained by solving the bk evolution equation @xcite or considering phenomenological qcd inspired models to describe the interaction of the dipole with the target .",
    "bk equation is the simplest nonlinear evolution equation for the dipole - hadron scattering amplitude , being actually a mean field version of the first equation of the b - jimwlk hierarchy @xcite . in its linear version",
    ", it corresponds to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite .",
    "the solution of the lo bk equation implies that the saturation scale grows much faster with increasing energy ( @xmath72 , with @xmath73 ) than that extracted from phenomenology ( @xmath74 ) .    in the last years the next - to - leading order corrections to the bk equation",
    "were calculated @xcite through the ressumation of @xmath75 contributions to all orders , where @xmath76 is the number of flavors .",
    "thanks to these works it is now possible to estimate the soft gluon emission and running coupling corrections to the evolution kernel .",
    "the authors have found out that the dominant contributions come from the running coupling corrections , which allow us to determine the scale of the running coupling in the kernel .",
    "the solution of the improved bk equation was studied in detail in ref .",
    "the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental data , with the geometric scaling regime being reached only at ultra - high energies . in @xcite a global analysis of the small @xmath3 data for the proton structure function using the improved bk equation was performed ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast to the bk equation at leading logarithmic @xmath77 approximation , which fails to describe the hera data , the inclusion of running coupling effects in the evolution renders the bk equation compatible with them ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in what follows we consider the bk predictions for @xmath71 ( from now on called rcbk ) obtained using the gbw @xcite initial condition .    .",
    "in what follows we shall consider two different nuclei , ca and pb , and use the deuteron ( d ) as a reference to calculate the experimentally measured ratios @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we assume that the diffractive slope parameter is @xmath80 gev@xmath81 and that the nucleus form factor is given by : f_a(t_)=d^2b  j_0(b)t_a(b ) , [ eq2 - 1 ] where the thickness function is given in terms of the nuclear density @xmath82 as : @xmath83 with the normalization fixed by @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the predictions of the glauber ( solid line ) , schwimmer ( dot - dashed line ) , eikonal ( dashed line ) and double scattering ( dot - dot - dashed line ) models for the ratios with the e665 experimental data at small @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although joined with lines , our results are computed at the same @xmath85 and @xmath86 as the experimental data .",
    "our results demonstrate that if we compute the nuclear structure function up to two scatterings , which implies that @xmath87 , we are not able to describe the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , since the magnitude of the first correction , @xmath88 , is very large , then there is no hope to estimate the nuclear structure function by just summing a few terms in the multiple scattering series .",
    "therefore , a full resummation of the multiple scatterings is necessary , which makes the predictions model dependent .",
    "the agreement with the current experimental data at small @xmath3 of the glauber , schwimmer and eikonal models is quite reasonable taking into account that no parameters have been fitted to reproduce the data .",
    "this implies that the current data are not able to discriminate between the unitarization schemes .",

    "the behaviour of the nuclear wave function at high energies provides fundamental information for the determination of the initial conditions in heavy ion collisions and particle production in collisions involving nuclei .",
    "one of the main uncertainties is associated to the magnitude of the nuclear shadowing , which comes mainly from the way in which the multiple scattering problem is treated and from the modelling of the projectile - nucleon interaction . since a future eic will probe the shadowing region while keeping sufficiently large @xmath9 , new studies which determine the main sources of uncertainties in the predictions are necessary . in this work",
    "we compare three frequently used approaches to estimate the nuclear shadowing in nuclear dis . as in these approaches",
    "the nuclear cross section is completely determined once the interaction of the projectile with the nucleon is specified , we considered a single model ( rcbk ) as input of our calculations in order to quantify the theoretical uncertainty which comes from the choice of the unitarization model .",
