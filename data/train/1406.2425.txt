    "the _ group determinant _ @xmath11 of a given finite group @xmath0 defined as the determinant of the group matrix @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath4 are indeterminates indexed by the elements in @xmath0 , played an important role .",
    "( one should note that the definition of @xmath11 is independent of the choice of the ordering of elements in @xmath0 . ) indeed , the group determinant @xmath11 reflects the structure of the regular representation of @xmath0 , which contains all the irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "the factorization of @xmath11 is corresponding to the irreducible decomposition of the regular representation , and the irreducible character values appear as coefficients in the factors . in 1991 ,",
    "formanek and sibley @xcite shows that two groups are isomorphic if and only if their group determinants coincide under a suitable correspondence between the sets of indeterminates for these groups : @xmath14 namely , the group determinant is a perfect invariant for finite groups . in this paper , we extend the notion of group determinants .",
    "actually , we define an invariant @xmath5 for a given pair @xmath6 , @xmath0 being a finite group and @xmath1 its subgroup , by employing the _ wreath determinant _ @xcite . for a positive integer @xmath7 , the _ @xmath7-wreath determinant _",

    "in fact , since @xmath15 is _ not _ relative invariant under general permutations in columns ( i.e. the action of @xmath20 from the right ) , we should take account of the _ ordering _ of @xmath0 to define @xmath5 .",
    "this is a crucial difference from @xmath11 .",
    "we note that @xmath21 is nothing but the original group determinant @xmath11 since the @xmath22-wreath determinant is the ordinary determinant",
    ".    it would be fundamental and natural to explore an analog of the frobenius character theory as well as e.g. formanek - sibley type theorems for @xmath5 .",
    "there are , however , certain obstacles in the study",
    ". one of the most essential one is the fact that the definition of @xmath5 is _ ordering - sensitive _ ; if we exchange the ordering of the columns in the matrix @xmath23 ( sometimes called as a group - subgroup matrix ) , then its wreath determinant becomes rather different from the one before manipulated .",
    "actually , one needs to taking account of representations of symmetric groups of order @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , as a small first step , we analyze @xmath5 when @xmath0 is a finite _ abelian _ group under a certain _ specialization of indeterminates _ , in which case the difficulties mentioned above are fairly reduced .",
    "we give a factorization of @xmath5 when @xmath1 is a direct product of several components in @xmath24 and the indeterminates are specialized to powers of another indeterminate @xmath25 according to a suitably chosen ordering of elements in @xmath0 . imitating the result and proof for finite abelian groups , we give also certain computations for non - abelian group - subgroup pairs under some particular condition . in the last section , we will give several examples for non - abelian groups as well as another specializations of indeterminates .",
