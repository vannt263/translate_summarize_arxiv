    "if we redraw the path starting from another point on the circle but passing through the same points on the line in the same order , the path closes to form an inscribed polygon , that is , we shall arrive at the starting point .    in spirit",
    ", this startling property is similar to steiner s famous porism @xcite , which states that once we find two circles , one inner to the other , such that a closed chain of neighbor - wise tangent circles inscribed in the region between them is possible , then an infinite number of such inscribed chains exist ( figure [ fig : steiner ] ) .",
    "one may set the initial circle at any position and the chain will close with tangency .",
    "yet another geometric phenomenon in the same category is poncelet s porism @xcite .",
    "the property for the cyclic quadrilateral described at the outset may be restated similarly : if four points on a line admit a cyclic quadrilateral then an infinite number of such quadrilaterals inscribed in the same circle exist .",
    "hence the term _ porism _ is justified .",
    "+ in the next sections we restate the theorem and define a map of reversion through point , which may be represented by pseudo - unitary matrices .",
    "the technique developed allows one to prove the theorem as well as a diagrammatic representation of the relativistic addition of velocities , presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a slight modification to arbitrary two - dimensional clifford algebras allows one to modify the result to hold for hyperbolas and provides a geometric realization of trigonometric tangent - like addition .",
    "let us present the result more formally .",
    "reversion of a point @xmath6 on a circle through point @xmath2 gives point @xmath7 on the circle such that points @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 are collinear ( see figure [ fig : reversion ] ) .",
    "more precisely :    given a circle @xmath9 , a * reversion * through point @xmath10 is a map @xmath11 : @xmath12 , such that points @xmath13 are collinear , and @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , then for any @xmath16 we define @xmath17 .        by bold @xmath11",
    "we denote the reversion map defined by point @xmath2 ( not bold ) .",
    "clearly , reversion through @xmath18 is an involution , @xmath19 , and therefore invertible .",
    "the product of reversions is in general not commutative , @xmath20 .",
    "the main result may now be given a concise form :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath21 be collinear points , @xmath9 a circle , and @xmath22 the composition of the corresponding reversions . then @xmath23    the quadrilateral @xmath24 $ ] may be viewed as a member of a family parametrized by @xmath1 . as @xmath1 moves along the circle ,",
    "the quadrilateral continuously changes its form while the points of intersection with the line remain invariant .",
    "the quadrilateral appears to be `` rotating '' with points @xmath25 playing the role of `` axes '' of this motion . for an animated demonstration ,",
    "see @xcite .        here is an equivalent version of theorem [ thm : main ] :    [ thm : equiv ] let @xmath9 be a circle and @xmath0 a line with three points @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a point on the circle .",
    "the point @xmath4 , an intersection of line @xmath0 with line @xmath26 $ ] , does not depend on @xmath27 .    in other words , for any three collinear points @xmath28 , there exists a unique point @xmath4 on @xmath0 such that _ any _ cyclic quadrilateral inscribed in @xmath9 passing through @xmath29 ( in the same order ) must also pass through @xmath4 .",

    "clearly , they can have untwisted shape and also the points of intersection can lie outside the circle and the line does not need to intersect the circle .",

    "indeed , take their ratio : @xmath42 where , to get the first expression in the second line , we multiplied the numerator and the denominator by @xmath43 and used the fact that @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy ( and not necessary ) to check that @xmath45 ( up to mbius equivalence).@xmath46 + a more abstract definition of the matrix representation emerges .",
