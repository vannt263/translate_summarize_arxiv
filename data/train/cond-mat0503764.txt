    "the mott metal - insulator transition plays a central role in the physics of all strongly correlated electron materials . at a qualitative level , localization of the electrons can occur when the kinetic energy gain ( typically given by the bare bandwidth ) is smaller than the cost in on - site repulsive coulomb energy ( @xmath7 ) . in recent years ,",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite@xmath8@xcite has provided a consistent theoretical framework which has advanced our understanding of this phenomenon  @xcite , in particular through the study of simplified models such as the one - band hubbard model .    in real materials however , such as transition metal oxides , several orbital components are involved .",
    "crystal - field effects and the coulomb exchange energy ( @xmath0 ) affect the energy of on - site atomic states , which no longer depend only on the total local charge as in the orbitally degenerate case .",
    "furthermore , the inter - site hopping amplitudes can be significantly different for different orbital components ( due e.g to their relative orientations ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to understand how these effects can affect the mott transition , and whether qualitatively new effects are possible when the orbital degeneracy is lifted .",
    "recently , this question has attracted a lot of attention . in their study of ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 , anisimov _ et al . _",

    "several studies have been performed in the model context , with controversial results  @xcite .",
    "liebsch   initially challenged the existence of such an `` orbital - selective mott transition '' ( osmt ) , on the basis of dmft calculations .",
    "koga and coworkers  @xcite , on the other hand , did find an osmt within their dmft calculations , and suggested that a unique transition is found only if @xmath1 .",
    "a symmetry argument was put forward to explain this finding .    in this paper , a clarification of this problem is attempted , using dmft and another , complementary approach .",
    "the latter is based on a representation of fermion operators in terms of slave quantum spins , specifically forged to address multi - orbital models ( sec .",

    "in this section , we introduce a new representation of fermion operators in terms of constrained ( `` slave '' ) auxiliary fields , which proves to be particularly convenient in order to study the multi - orbital hamiltonian above .",
    "the main idea at the root of any slave - variable representation is to enlarge the hilbert space and to impose a local constraint in order to eliminate the unphysical states .",
    "when the constraint is treated on average , a mean - field approximation is obtained .",
    "different slave - field representations will lead to different mean - field theories .",
    "the quality of the mean - field approximation can be improved by tailoring the choice of slave fields to the specific problem under consideration . in general",
    ", a compromise has to be found between the simplicity of the representation , the number of unphysical states which are introduced and the possibility of an analytical treatment of the resulting mean - field theory .    for finite - u hubbard models ,",
    "kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite have introduced a slave - boson representation which can be used in the present context , when appropriately generalised to multi - orbital models ( in the spirit of the gutzwiller approximation @xcite ) .",
    "however , this method introduces many variational parameters . on the opposite ,",
    "s.florens and one of the authors introduced a very economical representation of the n - orbital hubbard model with @xmath27 symmetry based on a single slave variable , taken to be the phase conjugate to the total charge on a given lattice site ( slave rotor representation ) @xcite .",

    ", we introduce a new slave - variable representation  ) , we present here the general procedure . ]",
    "especially suited for dealing with multiband models , and addressing orbital - dependent properties .",
    "the basic observation behind this scheme is that the two possible occupancies of a spinless fermion on a given site , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be viewed as the two possible states of a spin-1/2 variable , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this representation has been widely used in the case of hard - core bosons . in the fermionic context",
    "however , one needs to insure anticommutation properties , and this is done by introducing an auxiliary fermion @xmath32 , with the additional local constraint : f^f = s^z + in this manner , one obtains a faithful representation of the hilbert space , which reads : @xmath33 this constraint eliminates the two unphysical states @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this representation is easily extended to the multi - orbital case , by treating each orbital and spin species in this manner .",
    "hence a set of @xmath36 spin-1/2 variables @xmath37 and auxiliary fermions @xmath38 are introduced ( @xmath39 is the number of orbitals ) , obeying the local constraint on each site : [ eq : constraint ] ^f_im = s^z_im+ , this constraint can e.g be imposed with lagrange multipliers fields @xmath40 .",
    "we now explain how to rewrite the original hamiltonian ( [ non - int_h],[h_int ] ) in terms of the slave spins and auxiliary fermions .",
    "we consider first for simplicity the case @xmath1 , since the case @xmath26 requires an additional approximation , as discussed later . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the interaction involves only the total electron charge on a given site , and therefore reads : [ h_int_spin_j=0 ] h_int^j=0_i ( _ m,_im)^2 = _ i(_m , s^z_im)^2 in order to express the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian , we need to choose an appropriate representation of the creation operator of a physical electron , @xmath41 .",
    "there is some freedom associated with this , since different operators in the enlarged hilbert space spanned by the slave - spin and auxiliary fermions can have the same action on the physical ( constrained ) hilbert space .",
    "we have not used the obvious possibility @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "this representation is correct in the physical hilbert space ( i.e when the constraint is treated exactly ) , but it can be shown that additional mean - field approximations based on this representation will ultimately lead to a problem with spectral weight conservation because @xmath44 and @xmath45 do not commute .",
    "instead , we have chosen the representation @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which is identical to the previous one on the physical hilbert space , and involves commuting slave - spin operators . with this choice ,",
    "the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian reads : h_0&=&-_m t_m _ < ij > , 4s^x_ims^x_jm(f^_imf_jm+ h.c ) + & + & _ i , m(_m- ) f^_imf_imat this stage , no approximation has been made , provided the constraint is treated exactly .",
    "approximations will now be introduced , which consists in three main steps : i ) treating the constraint on average , using a static and site - independent lagrange multiplier @xmath48 ii ) decoupling the auxiliary fermions and slave - spin degrees of freedom , and finally iii ) treating the slave - spin hamiltonian in a single - site mean - field approach .",
    "this last step is quite independent of the two previous ones , and can be rather easily improved on , as done in @xcite .",
    "after the first two steps , one obtains two effective hamiltonians : [ eq : h_f ] h_eff^f&=&-_m t_m^eff _",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are effective hoppings and slave - spin exchange constants which are determined from the following self - consistency equations : [ eq : scc ] & t_m^eff & = 4t_ms^x_ims^x_jm[titilde ] + & j^eff_m&= t_mf^_imf_jm+f^_jmf_im[eq : jeff ] the free fermion hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_f ] ) describes the quasiparticle degrees of freedom .",
    "their effective mass is set by the renormalisation of the hopping : @xmath52 .",
    "the quasiparticle weight is associated with a different quantity , namely : [ eq : zm ] z_m = 4s^x_im^2 note that it depends in general on the orbital , a key feature for the physics that we want to address with this technique .",
    "both the renormalisation of the mass and the quasiparticle weight are self - consistently determined from the solution of the quantum - spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_s ] ) , which describes the charge dynamics . as clear from ( [ eq : zm ] ) , metallic behaviour for orbital @xmath17 corresponds to long - range order in @xmath53 , while mott insulating behaviour corresponds to @xmath54 .    at this stage ,",
    "the slave - spin degrees of freedom are still described by a quantum spin hamiltonian on the lattice , and we therefore make the additional approximation ( iii ) of treating this model on the level of a single - site mean - field .",
    "we thus have to solve - the single - site spin hamiltonian : [ eq : hs_mft ] h_s = _",
    "m2h_m s^x_m+_m_m(s^z_m+)+h_int[_m ] in which the mean - field @xmath55 is determined self - consistently from : h_m = 2z j_m^eff s^x_m where @xmath56 is the coordination number of the lattice .",

    "_ mf^_mf_min this expression , the fermionic expectation value is to be calculated with the quasiparticle hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_f ] ) . within this single - site mean - field approximation",
    "however , the renormalisation of the hopping becomes identical to the quasiparticle residue since @xmath57 factorizes into @xmath58 . as a result ,",

    "equations ( [ eq : zm],[eq : hs_mft],[eq : hm_scc],[eq : hf_mft ] ) and the constraint equation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) self - consistently determine the variational parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "they are the basic mean - field equations based on the slave - spin representation , which will be used below . solving these equations",
    "requires to diagonalize the single - site spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : hs_mft ] ) , corresponding to a @xmath62 matrix .",
    "let us finally discuss the case of a non - zero hund s coupling @xmath26 .",
    "the first three terms in ( [ h_int ] ) are easy to treat in the slave - spin formalism , since they involve only density - density interactions and are thus directly expressed in terms of the ising components of the slave spins .",
    "they read : _",
    "i(_m , s^z_im)^2 + j_i , m ( _ s^z_im)^2 - _",
    "i,(_m s^z_im)^2 in contrast , the `` spin - flip '' and ( intra - site ) `` pair - hopping '' terms ( last two terms in ( [ h_int ] ) ) are more difficult to deal with , since they involve both slave - spin and auxiliary fermions operators . as a result ,",
    "four - fermion terms are introduced which require additional mean - field decouplings . for simplicity",
    ", we choose to mimic the effect of these terms by replacing them by operators which have exactly the same effect on the slave - spin quantum numbers of the hilbert space , namely : & -&j_i + & -&j_i , despite the fact that these terms connect the physical and unphysical parts of the hilbert space ( and therefore would strictly vanish if the constraint was implemented exactly ) , it is reasonable to expect that they will qualitatively describe the physics of the spin - flip and pair - hopping terms when the constraint is treated on average , because their action on the slave - spin quantum numbers is the correct one .",
    "hence , we shall use the following representation of the interacting part of the hamiltonian for @xmath26 : [ h_int_spin ] h_int&&_i(_m , s^z_im)^2 + & + & j_i , m ( _ s^z_im)^2 - _",

    "in fact , as shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : rotors_vs_spins ] , the whole dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath7 is identical to that of the ga .    the slave spin representation has several advantages over the slave - boson representations that can be used to formulate the ga .",
    "one advantage is that the number of variables is smaller : @xmath36 spin-@xmath84 degrees of freedoms instead of @xmath85 slave bosons ( one associated to each state in the hilbert space , in the absence of symmetries ) .",
    "another advantage is that the number of unphysical states is smaller than in slave boson representations , because the hilbert space spanned by the @xmath36 quantum spins is finite by construction , while the hilbert space associated with the slave bosons in the absence of the constraint is an infinite - dimensional one .",
    "this might be useful in considering finite - temperature properties and the entropy of the model .",
    "a similar remark applies when comparing the present slave - spin representation to the slave - rotor representation recently developed by s.  florens and one of the authors @xcite .",
    "this representation is specifically tailored to @xmath64 symmetric models , and is very economical since it introduces only _ one _ slave variable .",

    "it is clear from these expressions that there is a close similarity between the slave - spin and slave - rotor formalisms .",
    "two important differences must be noted : ( i ) a single slave - rotor variable is introduced for all orbitals and ( ii ) the hilbert space of the unconstrained rotor is infinite - dimensional , containing an infinite tower of charge states @xmath87 which are physical only for @xmath88 . as a result , mean - field approximations in which the constraint is treated only on average are less accurate when the contribution of these unphysical charge states become sizeable .",

    "we observe however that this argument applies to the instability of the large - u mott phase ( in which both bands are gapped ) when @xmath7 is reduced , and suggests that , for @xmath1 , the mott gap closes at the same value of @xmath7 for both bands when @xmath116 is reduced .",

    "first , for small values of @xmath7 when both orbitals are itinerant , it is obvious that a hybridization will not change qualitatively the low - energy nature of the metallic phase .",
    "also , at very large @xmath7 , when both orbitals are localized and a gap exists in both orbital sectors , we expect the presence of a gap to be a robust feature which persists in the presence of @xmath2 . however , it is also clear that introducing @xmath2 into this gapped insulator allows the local moments formed in the mott insulating state at @xmath181 to screen each other .",
    "this occurs through the formation of on - site bonding and antibonding `` molecular '' levels mixing the two orbitals . as a result",
    ", the local - moment mott insulator is expected to be replaced by a mott insulator in which _ local singlets _ are formed on each site . the intermediate @xmath7 regime , in which the system is in the osmp at @xmath181 , is more delicate .",

    ", we also demonstrate that , for small values of @xmath2 , the heavy - fermion metallic state , and not the kondo insulating phase , is induced .",
    "we note , finally , that both the kondo - insulating phase , and the phase obtained at large @xmath7 in which on - site local moments in different orbitals screen each other , have a singlet ground - state .",
    "it is therefore not obvious a priori whether these two phases are continuously connected  @xcite , as found in @xcite for a related ( but different ) model , or whether a phase transition between them can exist .",
    "we return to this point at the end of this section .    in any event",

    "we thus keep the following terms in the low - frequency expansion of the self - energy : @xmath194 the low - energy quasiparticle band structure is then given by : @xmath195[\\omega - z_2\\epsilon_2(\\vk)]-z_1z_2 [ v+\\sigma_{12}(0)]^2=0\\ ] ] from this expression , it is easily seen that a gap is present whenever : @xmath196 in this expression , @xmath197 is the effective hybridisation between low - energy quasiparticles , and @xmath198 the renormalised quasiparticle half - bandwidths , given by : @xmath199\\,\\,,\\,\\ , \\deff1=z_1 d_1\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\d2eff = z_2d_2 \\label{eq : eff}\\ ] ] remarkably , @xmath148 and @xmath149 drop out from ( [ eq : cond_gap ] ) , and the condition for a quasiparticle bandgap therefore reads : @xmath200 if this condition is satisfied ( and @xmath186 ) , one has a kondo insulator phase , with a quasiparticle band gap given by : @xmath201 in the opposite case , a heavy - fermion ( gapless ) metallic phase is formed .    from ( [ eq : cond_gap_dropz ] ) , it is seen that it is the off - diagonal component of the self - energy ( induced by @xmath2 ) which plays the key role in deciding whether a gap opens or not . from the same equation , it is also clear that _ a band - gap can not open for arbitrary small @xmath2_. indeed , at small @xmath2 , @xmath202 grows at most proportionally to @xmath2 , and hence the left - hand side of ( [ eq : cond_gap_dropz ] ) is small , while the right - hand side is finite ( note that the r.h.s involves the _ bare _ bandwidths ) .",
    "hence , a critical value of @xmath2 is required to open a band gap and enter the kondo insulating phase , starting from the osmp .",
    "note that this analysis is general and relies only on fermi - liquid considerations , independently of the specific method used to solve the model .",
    "note also that the situation is very different when one of the bare bands is dispersionless ( @xmath203 ) , as is the case of the periodic anderson models considered in @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is clear from ( [ eq : cond_gap_dropz ] ) that an arbitrarily small @xmath2 induces the kondo insulating state .",
    "the formation of a heavy - fermion metallic state induced by a non - zero hybridization in a generalized periodic anderson model with @xmath204 ( direct f - electron hopping ) was also investigated in our recent work  @xcite .",
    "the slave - spin mean field results presented above can be placed in the context of this general low - frequency analysis . within this approach",
    ", one has : @xmath205 it is important to realize that this approach does provide an off - diagonal component of the physical electron self - energy , which , using ( [ eq : eff ] ) , is given by : @xmath206 note that in more conventional slave - boson approaches , the physical electron operators are related to the quasiparticles by a slave - boson condensation amplitude which is a c - number ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "as a result , @xmath208 , and no off - diagonal component of the self - energy is present . in such slave - boson approaches , the condition for the presence of a quasiparticle band gap is therefore entirely unrenormalized by interactions and reads : @xmath209 .",
    "this is an oversimplification which is not present in the slave - spin approach .",
    "there , the criterion for the opening of a gap reads : @xmath210 however , despite the renormalisation of the hybridisation by the off - diagonal self - energy , we find that in practice this criterion is very close to the non - interacting one , which gives a reasonable approximation of the critical hybridization necessary to open a band gap .",
    "we also note that , within the slave - spin approximation , the insulating gap takes its bare value @xmath211 ( corresponding to the splitting between the bonding and antibonding molecular levels ) as soon as @xmath182 , which is certainly an over - simplification .",
    "finally , we comment on the phase transitions between the different phases induced by a non - zero hybridization . at small @xmath2 , it is clear that there must exist a phase transition between the metallic ( gapless ) heavy - fermion phase and the insulating ( gapped ) phase , as @xmath7 is increased ( as indeed seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap ] , top panel ) .",
    "the situation is less clear at larger @xmath2 .",
    "there , we always expect an insulator with a singlet ground - state . however , the mechanism behind this singlet formation is rather different at smaller and larger values of @xmath7 . in the former case ,",
    "kondo screening dominates and the singlet is formed by screening the local moment in orbital 2 by the electrons in orbital 1 . at larger @xmath7 ,",
    "the kondo coupling is smaller , and it is the formation of an inter - orbital molecular bonding level ( due to @xmath2 ) which is responsible for the singlet formation . within slave - spin mean theory , we find a phase transition between these two kinds of insulator as @xmath7 is increased , the latter one being signalled by @xmath182 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this phase transition is a real feature or an artefact of the slave - spin approximation . in @xcite , koga et al .",
    "recently suggested that these two phases should be adiabatically connected , as found also in the study of the periodic anderson model with correlated conduction electrons  @xcite ( note however that the present model is different , in that both bands have a dispersion and that an inter - orbital interaction is present ) .",
    "the problem is qualitatively similar ( but not equivalent , because of the inter - orbital interaction ) to the two - impurity kondo problem  @xcite , in which the inter - impurity singlet ( rkky ) fixed points and the kondo- singlet fixed points are in general adiabatically connected ( except in the special case of particle - hole symmetry , where a phase transition does occur ) .",
    "note that it is well known  @xcite that for this latter model , slave boson approximations do lead to spurious first - order transitions . a full answer to",
    "this question is beyond the scope of this paper , and is left for a future investigation , together with a complete phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and hybridization .",
    "in this article , we have studied whether the mott transition of a half - filled , two - orbital hubbard model with unequal bandwidths occurs simultaneously for both bands or whether it is a two - stage process in which the orbital with narrower bandwidth localizes first ( giving rise to an intermediate ` orbital - selective ' mott phase ) . in order to study this question ,",
    "we have used two techniques .",
    "the first is a mean - field theory based on a new representation of fermion operators in terms of slave quantum spins .",
    "this method is similar in spirit to the gutzwiller approximation , and the slave - spin representation has a rather wide range of applicability to multi - orbital models .",
    "the second method is dynamical mean - field theory , using exact diagonalization and quantum monte - carlo solvers .",
    "the results of the slave - spin mean - field confirms several aspects of previous studies  @xcite , and in particular the possibility of an orbital - selective mott transition .",
    "however , some of the conclusions differ from those of previous work .",
    "specifically , the slave - spin approximation suggests that a critical value of the bandwidth ratio @xmath120 exists , such that the mott transition is orbital - selective for arbitrary value of the coulomb exchange ( hund coupling ) @xmath0 when @xmath212 .",
    "when @xmath213 , @xmath0 has to be larger than a finite threshold for an osmt to take place .",
    "this suggests that the existence of an osmt is not simply related to the symmetry of the interaction term only .",
    "in particular , an intermediate phase is found for @xmath1 at small @xmath115 .",
    "we have studied whether dmft confirms these findings , and found that the main qualitative conclusions on the existence of the orbital - selective phase are indeed the same , but that the nature of the intermediate phase at @xmath1 is a rather subtle issue . indeed",
    ", the narrow band does not have the properties of a gapped mott insulator in this phase and displays finite spectral weight down to arbitrary low - energy .",
    "this is , for example , consistent with a pseudo - gap behaviour but requires further studies to be fully settled ( using e.g low - energy techniques such as the numerical renormalization group ) .",
    "we note also that our study emphasizes the key role of the exchange and ( on - site ) inter - orbital pair hopping terms in the coulomb hamiltonian in stabilizing the orbital - selective phase , in agreement with koga et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we found that the orbital - selective mott phase is generically unstable with respect to an inter - orbital hybridization @xmath2 . in the presence of such a term ,",
    "two possible phases are obtained , depending on the strength of @xmath7 and @xmath2 .",
    "either the narrow orbital acquires a large ( but finite ) effective mass , corresponding to a heavy - fermion metallic state . or the system is an insulator with a gap .",
    "this insulator differs from the mott insulator at @xmath181 since it has a singlet ground - state .",
    "this is due to screening processes , involving both kondo exchange and the formation of an on - site molecular ( bonding ) level . whether one has in fact two different insulating phases separated by a phase transition",
    "( each phase being dominated by one of these screening processes ) -as obtained by slave - spin mean - field- , or whether one has a simple crossover  @xcite is an open question which deserves further study .    of course , at intermediate temperature ( above the quasiparticle coherence scale of the narrower band , but below that of the wider band ) , a physics similar to the orbital - selective mott phase can be recovered even in the presence of a finite hybridization .",
    "this orbital - selective heavy - fermion state might be relevant to the physics of ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 .",
    "this is indeed supported by the recent angular magnetoresistance oscillations experiments of balicas et al .",
