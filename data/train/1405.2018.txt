    "the box - ball system ( bbs)@xcite has been extensively studied as _ digitalized _ integrable systems . the properties of the bbs such as the relation to the discrete kp ( or kdv ) equation and its conserved quantities etc .  has been well understood through the ultradiscretization@xcite . from the ultradiscretized system",
    ", we may frequently obtain systems such as cellular automata over integers by limiting the parameters and initial values to integers .",
    "this limitation is , however , not necessarily required for the equation itself .",
    "the ultradiscretized equations may be essentially regarded as the systems over real or rational numbers@xcite . in many cases of the integrable ultradiscrete systems that has been hitherto known ,",
    "their integrability has a close relationship with that of the corresponding discrete system before ultradiscretization ; therefore , the integrability of the ultradiscrete system may be considered to be guaranteed by that of the corresponding discrete system .",
    "this property is one of remarkable merits of ultradiscretization for proving the integrability of the given system as a matter of course .",
    "however , on the other hand , intrinsic qualities of ultradiscretized system seems to be hidden behind the outstanding ultradiscretized correspondence . in this paper , we consider a solitonic dynamical system in which the dependent variables are over finite fields . by investigating integrable dynamical systems over finite fields without such an a priori relationship ,",
    "novel insights about integrability itself may be expected .    below are the examples of integrable systems over finite fields . in @xcite , filter type cellular automata ( ca )",
    "are constructed from the schrdinger discrete spectral problem@xcite that have infinitely many conserved quantities . in @xcite ,",
    "integrable ca over cyclic group is obtained from the discrete sine - gordon equation ( hirota equation ) as mbius transformation .",
    "these two systems possess the lax representation .",
    "the algebro - geometric method for constructing solutions of the discrete kp equation and the discrete toda equation over finite fields is shown in @xcite , whose @xmath0 function in the bilinear form has @xmath1-soliton solutions .",
    "three examples above do not seem to have solitonically propagating waves .",
    "in @xcite , the discrete integrable system over the rational function field with indeterminate over @xmath2 is obtained from the generalized discrete kdv equation .",
    "the @xmath3-adic valuations of variables for the discrete kdv equation are also discussed in @xcite , which is considered as an analogue of ultradiscretization . as an application of integrable systems over finite fields ,",
    "the relationship between the dynamics of toda molecule over finite fields and the bch - goppa decoding is discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a formal analogue of the bbs over finite fields from the point of view of ultradiscrete bilinear form .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bbs ] , we give a brief introduction of the bbs , which is compared with the ffbbs we propose in section [ sec : ffbbs ] . in section [ sec :",
    "p3 ] , the ffbbs with @xmath4 is shown together with numerical simulations that exhibit stable propagations of solitons over finite field @xmath5 .",
    "then in section [ sec : proof ] , the exact one - soliton solutions , which have a nested structure similar to fractals , are proved . the last section [ sec : remarks ] is devoted to the conclusion and summary obtained in this paper .",
    "in this paper we propose the system that is an analogue of the bbs and investigate its properties . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "we summarize several matters relating to the bbs below @xcite .",
    "the bbs in the case that the capacity of each box is constant @xmath6 is shown as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dependent variable that is interpreted as the number of balls in the box at time @xmath9 and position @xmath10 . by the transformation between the dependent variables",
    "@xmath11 we obtain the ultradiscrete _ bilinear _ form under appropriate boundary conditions as follows : @xmath12 because the parameter @xmath6 is usually interpreted as the maximum number of balls that are stuffed into each box , @xmath6 is assumed to be positive ( @xmath13 ) for obtaining meaningful equations as the dynamics of ball moving .",
    "ordinarily , the term @xmath14 is eliminated as a matter of course .",
    "however , the term @xmath14 is left in ( [ eq : bbs])([eq : udbilinear ] ) as it is for the next section on purpose .",
    "furthermore by the transformation of variables @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16 from ( [ eq : uds ] ) , which stands for the combinatorial @xmath17@xcite .",
    "this dependent variable @xmath18 is called a carrier@xcite .",
    "the bbs we have shown here is the case of the carrier without limit ( the capacity of the carrier is @xmath19 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the bbs from @xmath9 to @xmath20 with @xmath21 is interpreted as the interaction between this carrier and the balls :    1 .   the carrier repeats ( ii ) and ( iii ) through all boxes from left to right .",
    "if a ball is in the box , the carrier picks up the ball .",
    "3 .   if the box is empty and the carrier contains at least one ball , the carrier drops one ball into the box .",
    "figure [ fig : bbssoliton1 ] shows the examples of time evolution of the bbs .    ) with @xmath21.,width=377 ]",
    "the bbs we have observed in the previous section is the well - studied system , and its important properties such as solutions , conserved quantities etc .",
    "are well - known .",
    "it is genuine integrable soliton systems with the @xmath22-valued dependent variables @xmath23 .",
    "however , even in the case @xmath21 , ( [ eq : bbs])([eq : udbilinear ] ) are equations over not binary but integer ( or real number ) , because the state of the carrier @xmath24 , i.e. the number of balls contained in the carrier , is specified by an integer ( or real number ) . one of our motivation stated in the introduction is to obtain an integrable system which does not have relation to ultradiscretization . in the following section ,",
    "we define a system of which all dependent variables are the elements in finite set , which also have good algebraic structures , namely the finite fields .      in this paper , we consider an analogue of the bbs over finite fields , based on the expressions ( [ eq : bbs])([eq : udbilinear ] ) .",
    "however , for example , trials for regarding ( [ eq : bbs ] ) as an equation over finite fields do not apparently go well .",
    "because the finite fields are not totally ordered sets and there is no definitions of magnitude relationship , we may not apply the minimum function @xmath25 in ( [ eq : bbs ] ) as it is . to that end",
    ", we observe the algebraic operation needed for the transformations among equations ( [ eq : bbs])([eq : udbilinear ] ) .",
    "then we find that , in addition to the four arithmetic operations of finite fields , the distributive law for the maximum function as binary operation , that is , @xmath26 are used ( @xmath27 ) . note that the addition is ` @xmath28 ' and the multiplication ` @xmath29 ' in max - plus algebra , and that @xmath25 is defined by @xmath30 as @xmath31 . in other words ,",
    "the operation needed for @xmath28 in the transformations ( [ eq : bbs])([eq : udbilinear ] ) is only the distributive law for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and such a property that @xmath28 is the function that returns the maximum value is not required .",
    "accordingly , we make a trial of replacing the binary operation @xmath32 by a function @xmath33 with the following properties ( [ eq : p0 ] ) , ( [ eq : p1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : p2 ] ) ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these properties yield @xmath37 which may be regarded as an analogue of the formula of @xmath28 @xmath38 namely , @xmath25 in ( [ eq : bbs ] ) is also replaced by means of this function @xmath39 as above .    in the case",
    "@xmath40 , there does not exist a function @xmath39 that satisfies ( [ eq : p0 ] ) , ( [ eq : p1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : p2 ] ) .",

    "therefore the known solutions of bbs can not be applied to construct solutions of ( [ eq : ffbilinear ] ) . ]",
    "we will prove by contradiction with the assumption that there exists @xmath39 that satisfies ( [ eq : p0 ] ) , ( [ eq : p1 ] ) , ( [ eq : p2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : p3 ] ) . in this proof , define @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which is the image of the map @xmath46 .",
    "then , @xmath47 immediately follows from ( [ eq : p0 ] ) , and @xmath48 from @xmath49 , and @xmath50 from @xmath51 .",

    "for all @xmath56 , we also obtain the following : @xmath57 if @xmath58 , then since @xmath59 is the image of the map , the function values are always zero @xmath60 and @xmath61 even for non - zero @xmath62 .",
    "this contradicts as @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the image @xmath59 contains at least one non - zero element @xmath64 and is at least one or higher - dimensional vector space with the non - zero element @xmath65 .    for this element @xmath66",
    ", we have @xmath67 whereas @xmath68 , where @xmath3 is the characteristic of @xmath2 ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "the carrier interpretation ( [ eq : bbscinfty1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bbscinfty2 ] ) also holds by replacing @xmath28 by @xmath39 .",
    "this ffbbs is apparently reversible with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which follows from the so - called unitarity condition of @xmath17 matrix .",
    "note that the indeterminate such as division by zero does not appear for all initial values because the evolution in this system is described by polynomials .",
    "this is a remarkable feature of ( [ eq : ffbilinear])-([eq : ffs ] ) compared with the preceding studies of dynamical systems over finite fields stated in the introduction .      in bbs ( [ eq : udbilinear ] )",

    ", it is clear that @xmath99 gives the zero - soliton solution and yields @xmath100 for ffbbs ( [ eq : ffbbs ] ) .",
    "thus , we may easily obtain the zero - soliton solution due to the formal analogue . in the next section",
    ", we will observe the typical solutions of the ffbbs .",
