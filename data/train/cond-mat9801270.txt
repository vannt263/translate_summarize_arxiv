    ". however , all these methods ( except for numerical ones ) are applicable only not too close to qpt .",
    "in particular , they lead to gaussian values of the qpt critical exponents",
    ". thus analytical consideration of the ground - state and finite - temperature properties in the vicinity of qpt is still an open problem .",

    "such a situation is reminiscent of weak itinerant magnets@xcite .",
    "an analysis of the ground - state qpt was performed in refs.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the upper critical dimensionality for such transitions is @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the dynamical critical exponent .",

    "( note that this is not the case for the qpt induced by magnetic field in degenerate systems with @xmath8 component order parameter since here @xmath9 see ref .",

    "this model is sufficient to express finite - temperature properties near qpt through the non - universal ground - state properties , but insufficient to obtain correct results for the latter .",

    "the situation is more complicated for finite temperatures , since close to temperature transition the system behaves as a corresponding classical magnet and therefore the picture of excitation spectrum differs from that at @xmath23    the aim of the present paper is to apply the above - discussed concepts for calculating ground - state and finite - temperature properties of transverse - field ising model ( @xmath24 ) and heisenberg model with strong easy - plane anisotropy ( @xmath25 ) . to this end we apply perturbation theory ( which is in fact an expansion in @xmath14 ) to the original lattice models ( not to their continuum analogs ) , which enables us to calculate non - universal ground - state quantum renormalizations .",
