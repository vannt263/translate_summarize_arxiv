    "a powerful classical double radio source , also known as an frii source ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , is powered by large scale outflows from a supermassive black hole system that resides at the center of a galaxy ( e.g. blandford & rees 1974 ; scheuer 1974 ) .",
    "the energy per unit time , or beam power , carried from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole to the large scale radio source is a fundamental physical parameter that , in part , describes the physical state of the black hole system .",
    "the beam power can be used to study many aspects of the source , the source population , interactions of the source with its environment , and the role of feedback between the black hole system , its environment , and the host galaxy ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; willott et al .",

    "it is possible to determine the beam power of a classical double ( frii ) radio source using multifrequency radio data that covers most of the radio emitting region and resolves several different regions of each radio lobe ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ; daly 1994 ; kharb et al .",

    "( 2009 ) for a detailed discussion of the method .",
    "obtaining these data requires a considerable amount of observing time .",
    "if a relationship between beam power and radio power can be established , it can be applied to other frii sources so that their beam power can be estimated from their radio power .",
    "the relationship between beam power and radio power has been studied for samples of radio sources that reside in gas rich environments .",
    "these sources are primarily fri sources ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) at relatively low redshift ( cavagnolo et al . 2010 ; birzan et al .",
    "2008 ; rafferty et al . 2006 ; dunn et al . 2005 ; birzan et al .",
    "it has also been studied for a small sample of 14 frii galaxies in the context of an open cosmological model ( wan & daly 1998 ) .    here , the relationship between beam power and radio power is determined for a sample of 31 frii radio galaxies with a broad range of redshift .",
    "the sample is described in section 2 .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , discussed and compared with other results and model predictions in section 4 , and summarized in section 5 . a standard spatially flat cosmological model with normalized mean mass density @xmath4 , cosmological constant @xmath5 , and hubble constant @xmath6 is assumed throughout .",
    "the sample studied consists of 31 very powerful frii radio galaxies with redshifts ranging from about 0.056 to 1.79 and core - hot spot sizes ranging from about 30 to 400 kpc drawn from the sample studied by odea et al .",
    "the sources have both beam powers and radio powers determined , and are 3crr sources ( laing , riley , & longair 1983 ) .",
    "the sources and source properties are listed in table 1 .",
    "the intrinsic 178 mhz energy per unit time per unit frequency , @xmath7 , is listed in column 3 , and is determined from the 178 mhz flux density , @xmath8 , and the radio spectral index , @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 .",
    "radio flux densities and spectral indices are obtained from jackson & rawlings ( 1997 ) and willott et al .",
    "the 178 mhz radio power , @xmath11 , is obtained by multiplying @xmath7 by 178 mhz , and the integrated radio power , @xmath12 is obtained by integrating @xmath13 over the frequency range from 200 to 400 mhz using the radio spectral index listed in column 9 .",
    "this frequency range is selected to match that studied by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) so that the results can be easily compared .",
    "values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are listed in columns 4 and 5 , respectively , of table 1 .",

    "( 2009 ) and are listed in column 6 .",
    "the ratio of the beam power to the radio power is listed in columns 7 and 8 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the classical double radio galaxies studied here are among the most powerful extended radio sources known in the cosmos .",
    "these powerful radio sources are often much larger than their parent galaxies and have cigar - like radio lobe structure indicating that the forward region of the radio emitting lobe is moving into the ambient gas supersonically ( e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ; leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ; liu , pooley , & riley 1992 ) .",
    "since the structure of the sources indicates that each is growing at a supersonic rate , the equations of strong shock physics may be applied to the sources ( leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ) .",
    "as discussed in detail by leahy ( 1990 ) , rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) , daly ( 1990 , 1994 ) , wan & daly ( 1998 ) , wan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for example , this means that the beam power @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant , @xmath16 is the rate of growth of the source , @xmath17 is the radius of the cross - sectional area of the forward region of the shock , and @xmath18 is the postshock pressure . each of these parameters has been determined empirically .",
    "odea et al . ( 2009 ) provide a detailed description of the method and related uncertainties and a comprehensive list of beam powers obtained using this method ; these are the sources studied here .",
    "remarkably , odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the beam power is independent of offsets from minimum energy conditions due to a cancellation of the way the offset enters into the determinations of @xmath18 and @xmath16 , so the beam power is insensitive to assumptions regarding minimum energy conditions .",
    "the beam power studied here has been obtained using the equation @xmath14 , where @xmath19 ( e.g. leahy 1990 ; wan et al .",
    "the rate of growth of the source @xmath16 is obtained using the equation @xmath20 .",
    "the change in the radio spectrum across a region @xmath21 along the symmetry axis of the source is used to obtain the time @xmath22 that has elapsed for the source length to change by an amount @xmath21 .",
    "the spectral aging method of meyers & spangler ( 1985 ) was applied to the kardashev - pacholczyk and jaffe - perola models ( jaffe & perola 1973 ) to obtain @xmath22 , and similar results were obtained with both models .",
    "details of the method used to obtain the quantities described above and the computations of their uncertainties are given in sections 2.1 , 2.2 , 3.1 , 3.2 , and 3.3 of odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in brief ,",
    "uncertainties in the injection spectral index , and the flux density at each frequency studied are included in the uncertainty of @xmath22 obtained for each value of @xmath21 .",
    "several different values of @xmath21 were considered for each source , and the value of @xmath23 obtained was found to be independent of the value of @xmath21 . in the computation of the rate of growth of the source , offsets of the true magnetic field strength @xmath24 from minimum energy conditions were parameterized by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the minimum energy magnetic field , and the geometric mean of the minimum energy fields 10 and 25 kpc from the hot spot along the symmetry axis of the source were used to obtain @xmath26 over the spectral aging region . the postshock pressure @xmath18",
    "was taken to be the pressure in the region 10 kpc behind the hot spot moving toward the core of the host galaxy along the symmetry axis of the radio source ; the pressure can be written @xmath27 ( e.g. wan et al .",
    "2000 ) , where @xmath26 here is obtained 10 kpc from the hot spot .",
    "it is shown in section 3.3 of odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that the offset from minimum energy conditions entering through @xmath16 cancels that entering through @xmath18 so that , for the sources studied here , @xmath0 is independent of offsets from minimum energy conditions .",
    "the uncertainty of the beam power is dominated by the uncertainties of the source rate of growth and pressure .",
    "the half - width of the source @xmath17 is taken to be the deconvolved half - width of the source , which is equal to @xmath28 times the deconvolved fwhm of the source ( see , for example , section 5.1 of wellman et al .",
    "widths were extracted at 1.4 ghz a distance 10 kpc behind the hot spot .",
    "detailed studies of these sources show that the source width is independent of the frequency of observation for the range of frequencies studied ( daly et al .",
    "for the new sources studied by odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the widths were obtained using a cross - sectional slice taken perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the source , as described by daly et al .",
    "the deconvolved fwhm , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fwhm of the best fit gaussian to the slice and @xmath32 is the observing beamwidth .",
    "the widths obtained were found to be in good agreement with those obtained earlier by wellman et al .",
    "the uncertainty of the deconvolved fwhm , @xmath33 , was obtained using the expression @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the uncertainty of the fwhm of the best fit gaussian profile and @xmath36 is the uncertainty of the observing beam . in practice",
    ", @xmath33 was always very close to @xmath35 ; only widths very close to the hot spot had a larger uncertainty , and these were at most about 35 % larger than @xmath35 .",
    "the beam power was studied as a function of radio power for the full sample of 31 sources and for a sample of 30 galaxies obtained by excluding the lone low redshift source in the sample , cygnus a. very similar results are obtained using the radio power defined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and considering the samples of 30 and 31 sources .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 1 , and best fit parameters are listed in table 2 . the uncertainties on the best fit parameters have been adjusted to bring the reduced chi - square of the fit to unity .",
    "overall , the data are described by the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "for powerful frii sources , most of the radio power is produced by the outer half of the radio lobe ( near the radio hot spots ) ( e.g. leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 ) .",
    "the result obtained here , @xmath40 , is consistent with @xmath41 at about one sigma .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained with a sample of 14 radio galaxies ( wan & daly 1998 ) .",
    "the efficiency with which beam power is converted to radio power is @xmath42 , and the constant of proportionality suggests the beam power may be converted to radio power with an overall efficiency of about 0.7 % .    the radio power and the beam power each increase with redshift , so there is a concern that the intrinsic relationship between beam power and radio power may be masked because each is correlated with redshift .",
    "this effect can be circumvented by studying the ratio @xmath43 rather than studying each quantity separately . to explore this",
    ", the ratio of the beam power to the radio power , @xmath43 , is studied as a function of redshift with and without cygnus a. the results are illustrated in figure 2 , and best fit parameters are listed in table 2 . without cygnus",
    "a , the ratio @xmath43 is independent of redshift , indicating that @xmath41 is intrinsic to the sources .",
    "when cygnus a is included , there is a tendency for the ratio to increase with redshift though the significance of the result is only about one sigma .",
    "this suggests that the relationship between beam power and radio power obtained for powerful classical double radio sources is intrinsic to the sources and is independent of redshift for redshifts ranging from about 0.4 to 2 , and possibly for redshifts from about zero to 2 .",
    "the expression used to obtain the beam power can be compared with that used to obtain the radio power of a given source .",
    "the radio power is obtained by integrating the radio surface brightness of the the source to obtain the flux density , multiplying this by the luminosity distance squared and appropriate redshift factors , and multiplying by the rest frame radio frequency or integrating over radio frequency to obtain @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the beam power depends on @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the widths and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the mean surface brightnesses of cross - sectional slices of the radio lobe 10 and 25 kpc , respectively , from the hot spot along the symmetry axis of the source and @xmath49 is the spectral aging break frequency .",
    "this expression assumes that synchrotron cooling dominates over inverse compton cooling and that @xmath50 , both of which apply to the sources studied here ( odea et al .",
    "as noted above , the length @xmath21 is measured from the hot spot to the location along the symmetry axis of the lobe where the break frequency @xmath49 is measured , and the product @xmath51 was found to be independent of @xmath21 , thus , the beam power is also independent of @xmath21 ( odea et al .",
    "the beam power depends upon several factors that do not enter into the calculation of the radio power , and the radio power depends upon factors that do not enter the beam power , so the correlation obtained here between these two parameters is likely to characterize an intrinsic physical relationship between beam power and radio power . in addition , the results obtained here are consistent with those obtained by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who used a completely different and independent method of determining the beam power , as discussed in section 4 .",
    "the results obtained here can be compared with those obtained by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who studied radio sources in gas rich clusters of galaxies and other gas rich environments .",
    "cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) expanded upon the sample studied by birzan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) by adding very lower power radio sources to the sample .",
    "the sources studied by these groups are primarily fri sources .",
    "the method used to obtain the beam power for these sources is significantly different from that described in section 3 . for the radio sources in gas rich environments studied by birzan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the p dv work done by the relativistic plasma on the intracluster medium is obtained and combined with the buoyancy timescale of the radio source to obtain the beam power ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2006 ; rafferty et al .",
    "cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) obtain @xmath52 , or @xmath53 , and the coefficient may be approximated as @xmath54 . as noted by these authors ,",
    "the buoyancy timescale is likely to be an overestimate of the true source age and some of the sources may be affected by multiple outflows ; these uncertainties would increase the uncertainties on parameters stated above .",
    "the slope of the relationship obtained here , @xmath55 , is within one sigma of that obtained by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , @xmath56 . the normalization of the relationship obtained by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , @xmath54 , differs from that obtained here , @xmath57 by less than 2 sigma .",
    "thus , the results obtained are remarkably similar even though different types of radio sources at different redshifts are studied . the small differences that do exist",
    "may be accounted for by uncertainties in fitted parameters , or by intrinsic differences between the sources .",
    "more data will be needed to compare results obtained with different methods in more detail .",
    "the agreement between the results obtained here and those of cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is particularly remarkable because the interaction of the sources with their environments is quite different : the forward region of frii sources is moving supersonically with respect to the ambient gas resulting in a strong shock whereas fri sources are not moving supersonically and in any case the method used by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) does not include energy that has gone into shocks .",
    "the results of cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) described above imply an efficiency of conversion of beam power to radio power of @xmath58 ; the slope is consistent with zero at about 2.5 sigma and the coefficient suggests a conversion efficiency of about 0.3% .",
    "if the slope is taken to be non - zero , it would suggest that the conversion efficiency increases with radio power and is about 0.3% at a power of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , both types of source appear to convert beam power to radio power with similar efficiencies : about 0.7% for frii sources and about 0.3% for fri sources .",
    "this provides a hint that the physics of the conversion of beam power to relativistic electrons and magnetic fields may be similar for fri and frii sources , perhaps with the efficiency of conversion increasing with radio power for fri sources .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that different physical processes for the conversion of beam power to radio power have similar efficiencies .",
    "the results obtained here can be compared with the theoretical model described by willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found that @xmath60 , where the term @xmath61 is expected to lie between 1 and 20 and is a combination of factors including the filling factor of the lobes , departure from minimum energy conditions , and the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles .",
    "this model prediction is obtained in the context of a detailed model based on the work of falle ( 1991 ) and kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) for extended radio sources .",
    "the dependence of beam power on radio power predicted by the model , which has an exponent of @xmath62 , is remarkably close to the value of @xmath63 obtained here .",
    "the normalization of the relationship obtained here , @xmath64 , indicates a value of @xmath65 . the fact that both the results obtained here and those obtained by cavagnolo et al . (",
    "2010 ) are in fairly good agreement with the model predictions suggests that the fundamental model provides a good description of the sources .",

    "the data indicated that @xmath66 , where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the results listed in table 2 may be applied to samples of frii sources with known radio power to obtain estimates of the beam power .    to determine whether the relationship between beam power and radio power evolves with redshift",
    ", the ratio of the beam power to radio power was studied as a function of redshift with and without the one low redshift source , cygnus a. excluding cygnus a , there is no redshift evolution of the ratio of beam power to radio power . including cygnus a",
    ", there is a tendency for the ratio to increase with redshift , but the significance of the result is marginal .",
    "thus , there is no conclusive evidence at this time that the ratio evolves with redshift .",
    "the results obtained here are broadly consistent with those obtained by cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for samples of radio sources in gas rich environments , which consist primarily of low redshift fri sources .",
    "interestingly , the results obtained here are consistent with the radio power being proportional to the beam power , with an efficiency of conversion of beam power to radio power of about 0.7% that is independent of or very weakly dependent upon radio power .",
    "this is comparable to the efficiency of about 0.3% indicated by fri sources , which may be weakly dependent upon radio power in the sense that the efficiency of conversion of beam power to radio power may increase weakly with radio power .",
    "the relationship between beam power and radio power obtained here may be compared with theoretical predictions obtained in the context of a specific model for the sources .",
