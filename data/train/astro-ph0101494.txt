    "there is still some ( @xmath34% ) residual quantum efficiency ( qe ) degradation in the @xmath32c data at the center of the acis - i array at 5.9  kev ; but this is improved over the @xmath35% loss incurred without cti correction ( townsley et  al .",
    "2000 ) . at @xmath33c ,",
    "the 5.9  kev qe loss from cti is @xmath36 10% at the center of the acis - i array before cti correction , and it is @xmath37% with correction . for a @xmath38 power law ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of photons per second per @xmath2 per kev , @xmath41 is a normalization constant , and @xmath42 is the photon index ) , 5% of the hard - band energy flux is lost due to this residual qe deficiency , so the incurred error is generally small compared to measurement error .",
    "we do not correct for this residual qe loss , as it is dependent on the spectral shape of the source , and the x - ray photon statistics are generally too limited to constrain the detailed spectral properties of the sources .",
    "for extremely hard sources , where most of the photon flux occurs at observed energies greater than 5  kev , it is possible that the hard - band fluxes will have been underestimated by a slightly larger factor .",
    "however , the hrma effective area is quite small above 5  kev , so few such extremely hard sources would be detected in the current sample regardless of the effects of cti .",
    "the background was stable during the entire 221.9  ks of observation .",
    "the 0.58  kev light curves have been inspected for all of the observations , and they are free from strong flaring due to  space weather . \" over the four observations , only seven 3.3-s frames were  dropped \" from the telemetry , which amounts to a data loss of less than 0.01% ( frames are dropped when background flaring occurs , causing the telemetry to be saturated ) . during any observation",
    "the background is stable to within @xmath43% , and the mean background levels from the four observations agree to within 10% .",
    "the average background over the fully exposed portion of the caltech area is 0.053  count  pixel@xmath3 in the 0.58  kev band .",
    "thus , even with a total observation length of 221.9  ks , the observation is still photon limited .",
    "acis should remain photon limited near the optical axis and for point source detection in the 0.58 kev band out to exposure lengths of @xmath44  ms .",
    "the x - ray data analysis performed in this paper was carried out using the  x - ray center s ( cxc s )  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software as well as the interactive data language ( idl ) based tools for acis real - time analysis ( tara ) software developed at penn state ( publicly available ; see broos et  al .",

    "the four observations were co - added after cross - registration using 12 bright x - ray sources detected in each of the individual observations near the optical axis ( see figure  [ register ] ) .",
    "all observations were reassigned to the coordinate system of observation 966 ( see table  [ chandralog ] ) , requiring shifts of @xmath45 and very small rotational corrections ( 0.01@xmath46 ) . after cross - registration ,",
    "the offsets of the other three observations from the coordinate system of 966 were zero within plausible errors with @xmath47 root mean square ( rms ) dispersion in right ascension and @xmath48 rms dispersion in declination .",
    "thus internal cross - registration of the four observation datasets is accurate to within @xmath49 .",
    "absolute x - ray source positions were obtained by matching bright ( @xmath50 25 counts ) 0.58  kev x - ray sources to either @xmath51 sources in the hogg00 catalog or any radio source in the r00 1.4 ghz catalog . using the astrometry as determined on board before any astrometric corrections were made , the 22 matched sources had a mean offset from the x - ray sources of 1.88@xmath52 . after shifting and slightly rotating the positions of the x - ray sources so that the mean offset was zero , the rms scatter in the offsets was @xmath53 .",
    "the dispersion in positional offsets for these 22 sources is shown in figure  [ register ] , along with an ellipse showing the rms dispersion of offsets for this group .",
    "we adopt @xmath54 as our systematic positional uncertainty but note that for x - ray sources with @xmath5510 counts and/or larger off - axis angles ( @xmath56 ) , the positional uncertainty will be dominated by photon statistics and will be @xmath57 .",
    "images were created from 0.58  kev ( full band ) , 0.52  kev ( soft band ) and 28  kev ( hard band ) using the ciao datamodel software .",
    "event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 were used in all analyses , as this is the grade distribution currently being supported by the cxc . in the future , as support is developed for different grade distributions , the effective background may be reduced by choosing a subset of these grades ( compare with brandt et  al .",

    "figure [ imagesmooth ] displays the same data adaptively smoothed at the @xmath58 level using the code of ebeling , white , & rangarajan ( 2001 ) .",
    "we did not use the adaptively smoothed images for source searching , but they do show most of the detected x - ray sources more clearly than the raw data . note that some of the sources we detect do not appear in figure  [ imagesmooth ] because they fall below the 3@xmath59 level of the adaptive smoothing .",
    "the amount of acis exposure for a given patch of sky in the caltech area is influenced by two main factors : ( 1 ) telescope vignetting reducing the effective area at larger off - axis angles , and ( 2 ) observatory dither changing the celestial location of bad pixels and gaps between the ccds and thus reducing the amount of time a given area is visible ( see figure  [ emap ] ) . an  effective exposure time , \" defined as the equivalent amount of exposure time for a source located at the aim point , can be calculated taking these two effects into account .    for this data set ,",
    "effective area maps were generated using a script developed by t. s. koch , p. s. broos , and d. p. huenemoerder .",
    "this script uses a combination of ftools ( ftools group 2000 ) and ciao datamodel tools to generate qe and effective area maps for each of the individual observations .",
    "the ciao tool mkexpmap , one of the tools used in the aforementioned script , makes a map of average effective area over an individual observation ( with units  @xmath60 ) .",
    "we generated an effective area map assuming a @xmath61 power - law spectrum for the full 0.58 kev energy range .",
    "to translate effective area into effective time , these effective area maps are binned into 1@xmath62 square pixels , and a median map is generated by replacing each effective area value with the median of the effective area values in a circular region of diameter 5@xmath62 , a dimension chosen to be representative of a source detection cell size .",
    "the motivation for making the median map was to produce a two - dimensional  look - up \" table whose individual entries would be appropriate for the range of  psf values over the entire survey area ( @xmath63@xmath64 ) .",
    "the median statistic was chosen over the average since it is more robust .",
    "the median map is divided by the maximum effective area and multiplied by the total exposure time .",
    "the four ( see table  [ chandralog ] ) individual exposure maps were added to produce the full exposure map ( see figure  [ emap ] ) for the entire 221.9  ks observation .",
    "figure  [ emap ] also shows the survey area as a function of effective exposure time and the distribution of exposure times for the 82 x - ray sources described in ",
    "[ xrpointsources ] ( effective exposure times for the individual sources are given in table  [ xraydata ] ) .",
    "the few sources with exposure times much shorter than 221.9  ks are located on or near the gaps between the ccds .",
    "these gaps have effective widths of @xmath65 ; the observatory dither reduces their sharpness and produces scatter in the exposure times .",
    "the mean effective exposure time in the entire region is 203@xmath66  ks .",
    "the median effective exposure time is 207  ks , and the minimum effective exposure possible is 89  ks in the center of the gaps between the ccds .",
    "we searched the images described in  3.1 with the wavdetect software ( dobrzycki et  al .",
    "1999 ; freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ) using the same methods and safety checks as brandt et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and h00 .",

    "the x - ray images shown in figure  3 have dimensions of @xmath72 pixels ; this means that we expect @xmath73 false detections per image for the case of a uniform , static background . in reality , the background is neither perfectly uniform or static .",
    "the background level decreases in the gaps between ccds and increases slightly near bright point sources due to the point spread function ( psf ) wings .",
    "this latter effect should be small in the current data , since there are few bright sources .",
    "the 90% encircled energy radius of the psf , even at @xmath74 off - axis and for the hardest energies under analysis here , is only @xmath75 .",
    "we mentioned in  [ acisobs ] that there were no significant background flares during any of the observations .",
    "however , there are other transient and more isolated phenomena , the most important of which is the occasional flaring pixel ( cxc , private communication ) . flaring pixels occur in front - side illuminated acis ccds when charge from an incident charged particle is released slowly in a fashion that resembles real x - rays .",
    "the result is a series of spurious events occurring in the same ccd pixel over 27 sequential frames .",
    "we have performed a flaring pixel analysis using code developed by t. miyaji , which searches temporally for events showing the characteristic energy decay of a flaring pixel event . using this code",
    ", we were able to reject nine sources where flaring pixel events combined with background events to exceed the source detection threshold ( see table  [ flaring ] ) .",
    "all of the rejected sources had fewer than nine counts , and only one had more than seven counts .",
    "all but one were also detected only in the soft band , and all sources were only present in one of the four observations .",
    "any sources with fewer than seven counts , especially if only detected in the soft band , are still considered marginal but are included in the x - ray source catalog .    even in a 221.9  ks observation",
    "the acis data are far from being background limited ( see  [ acisobs ] ) .",
    "over the entire caltech area the detection limit for point sources with our selection criteria is @xmath36  57 counts in the full , soft and hard bands . for a power - law model with photon index @xmath38 and the galactic column density , seven counts in 221.9",
    "ks corresponds to a soft ( hard ) observed flux detection limit of @xmath76  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 ( @xmath77  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "for the cosmology of  1 , at @xmath78 the corresponding rest - frame luminosity limits are @xmath79  erg  s@xmath3 ( @xmath80  erg  s@xmath3 ) ; even fairly low - luminosity seyfert galaxies should be detected at this redshift .",
    "a summary of the numbers of detected x - ray sources and the background levels in each of the three bands is given in table  [ xraydetections ] .",
    "we have also searched in the 58  kev band , described as the `` ultra - hard '' band in table  [ xraydetections ] , finding 10 sources .",
    "all but one of these 58  kev sources have strong 28  kev counterparts ; the one remaining source was detected with only 3.8  counts in the ultra - hard band .",
    "we have not included this faint ultra - hard - band source in the list as its detection is marginal at this point .",
    "there are a total of 82  sources in the caltech area , 73 of which are detected in the full band . of the 45 hard - band sources , 13",
    "are not detected in the soft band .",
    "of the 62 soft - band sources , 31 are not detected in the hard band .",
    "the fraction of soft - band sources detected only in the soft band is somewhat lower than the fraction of g01 , but the two are roughly consistent .",
    "the fraction of hard - band sources detected only in the hard band is somewhat higher than that of g01 ( 15/45 as compared to g01 s 15/91 ) .",
    "this difference could be due to the hardening of sources at faint fluxes ; the data presented in this paper are for a 221.9  ks observation , as compared to the 130  ks observation presented in g01 .",
    "the catalog of source detections and individual source properties is given in table  [ xraydata ] .",
    "the source positions listed are the wavdetect full - band x - ray source positions except when the source was only detected in the soft band ( there were no sources detected in the hard band but not in the full band ) . source photometry was performed by wavdetect whose accuracy was verified with our own aperture photometry .",
    "good agreement was found for sources with greater than 20 counts when using a circular aperture of radius 3.0@xmath62 and background annulus of inner and outer radius 4.0@xmath62 and 6.0@xmath62 , respectively . for sources with fewer than 20 counts , the agreement is not quite as tight , but it is still consistent within the errors quoted by wavdetect .",
    "three sources detected by wavdetect with fewer than five counts were found to have 58 counts when aperture photometry was performed .",
    "this discrepancy is due to a failure in the wavdetect source characterization code which occasionally  collapses \" one or both of the axes of the  source ellipse \" to zero , resulting in a gross underestimate of the number of counts present even though a source was detected with a probability threshold of @xmath81 .",
    "we have manually inspected these three discrepant sources and indeed find sources at the positions that wavdetect reports . for these sources ,",
    "we have used the counts determined by the aperture photometry ; all three are marked in table  [ xraydata ] . for sources that were not detected in a given band ,",
    "we determine upper limits at the 99% confidence level by interpolating between the values in table  3 of kraft , burrows , & nousek ( 1991 ) .",
    "all x - ray upper limits in this paper used this same methodology .",
    "the aperture sizes used to determine the upper limits depended on how far off axis the source was .",
    "aperture diameters of 2@xmath62 , 3@xmath62 , and 4@xmath62 were used for sources with off - axis angle , @xmath82 , satisfying @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .    the x - ray band ratio in table  [ xraydata ] is defined as the ratio of hard - band to soft - band counts , and it is plotted versus soft - band count rate for all the  sources in figure  [ bandratios ] .",
    "we find , with two exceptions ( see the caption of figure  [ bandratios ] ) , that the sources become harder at low soft - band count rates , consistent with the results of g01 .",
    "the power - law photon indices in table  [ xraydata ] have been determined from these x - ray band ratios using the ao2 version of the portable , interactive , multi - mission simulator ( pimms ; mukai 2000 ) . in the case of  low \" numbers of counts we assume @xmath61",

    "a more complete spectral analysis will be presented in paper iii .    in table",

    "these have been determined from the given count rates and photon indices using the ao2 version of pimms , except in the case of the two spectroscopically identified m  stars ( see  [ galactic ] ) where we have assumed a @xmath86  kev thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the listed fluxes have not been corrected for galactic absorption ; this effect is small due to the low galactic column density along the line of sight to the ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "we estimate the fluxes to be accurate to roughly  30% , as residual uncertainties of cti - induced qe loss and other calibration issues still exist .",
    "the errors introduced in the fluxes by using a @xmath61 power law for a source with a @xmath87 power - law continuum are 14% , 5% , and 2% for the full , hard , and soft bands , respectively .    using the normalization of ishisaki ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the 45 hard - band x - ray sources in the caltech area are found to account for @xmath88% of the diffuse extragalactic x - ray background in the hard band ( paper iii ; after adding the fraction of the background already resolved in wide - field surveys ) .      to investigate possible extended x - ray emission from the  sources ,",
    "we have identified the sources whose extents as determined by wavdetect ( see  9.2 of dobrzycki et  al .",
    "1999 ) significantly exceed the 50% encircled - energy radius of the  psf at 1.5  kev ( see figure  4.8 of the version 3  proposers observatory guide for the behavior of the  psf with source off - axis distance ) . recall that this is restricted to features found within ",
    "mexican hat \" regions having radii @xmath89 ( the maximum wavdetect scale was 16 pixels ; see  [ xrpointsources ] ) .",
    "we have manually inspected the resulting nine sources , and we do not find any with highly significant evidence for extent .",
    "all of the nine sources are located close to the center of the field of view , where small errors in image cross registration and satellite aspect reconstruction can most easily lead to false apparent extent .",
    "in addition , because the aim point position varied between observations ( see table  [ chandralog ] ) , there is not a unique psf applicable to all observations of any given source ; apparent source extent on the scale of about an arcsecond can be introduced by variations in the applicable psf from observation to observation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there are no sources found here by wavdetect with highly significant spatial extent .",
    "we note , however , that our constraints on the spatial extents of nearly point - like sources are limited in many cases due to small numbers of counts ( @xmath90 ) .    to investigate further any extended x - ray sources , we have searched the soft - band and hard - band images described above using the cxc s voronoi tessellation and percolation detection algorithm ( vtpdetect ; ebeling & wiedenmann 1993 ; dobrzycki et  al .",
    "we have used a probability threshold ( i.e. , a limit parameter ) of @xmath91 , and we require a minimum number of events per source ( i.e. , a coarse parameter ) of 10 . in our searching , we have included a  buffer \" region around the caltech area to minimize any edge effects that could affect extended sources in the caltech area .",
    "we do not find any highly extended sources in either the soft or the hard bands .",
    "we comment that much of the apparent diffuse emission seen in some of the adaptively smoothed images ( e.g. , figure  [ imagesmooth ] ) can be explained via a combination of instrumental background and emission in the wings of the psfs of bright point sources .",
    "while the methods we have used above to search for extended emission are effective and appropriate for the scope of this paper , we note that optimal extended source searching requires precise modeling of the underlying background .",
    "as improved understanding of the  background develops , we will improve our extended source searching appropriately .",

    "are the number of objects in each catalog located within the caltech area , the positional accuracy assumed , the number of objects with  source matches , and the estimated false match rate .",
    "the positional accuracy we assumed for a given catalog was generally slightly larger than that quoted by the particular author .",
    "we assumed @xmath92 positional accuracy for the x - ray sources ( see   [ xrimagecreate ] ) and used the positional error of each catalog object to determine counterparts of x - ray detections ; if a catalog object s positional offset from the x - ray source was less than the error on the object s position listed in table  [ catalogs ] , then a match was assumed . in practice ,",
    "the x - ray positional error was only considered when an individual catalog s positional uncertainty was less than 1.0@xmath62 ( e.g. , in the itself and for the very precise radio catalogs ) .",

    "<S> a deep x - ray survey of the hubble deep field north ( ) and its environs is performed using data collected by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. currently a 221.9  ks exposure is available , the deepest ever presented , and here we give results on x - ray sources located in the @xmath0 area covered by the caltech faint field galaxy redshift survey ( the `` caltech area '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this area has ( 1 ) deep photometric coverage in several optical and near - infrared bands , ( 2 ) extensive coverage at radio , submillimeter and mid - infrared wavelengths , and ( 3 ) some of the deepest and most complete spectroscopic coverage ever obtained . </S>",

    "<S> the 82  sources detected in the caltech area are correlated with more than 25 multiwavelength source catalogs , and the results of these correlations as well as spectroscopic follow - up results obtained with the keck and hobby - eberly telescopes are presented . </S>",
    "<S> all but nine of the  sources are detected optically with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> redshifts are available for 39% of the  sources , including 96% of the sources with @xmath7 ; the redshift range is 0.13.5 , with most sources having @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> eight of the x - ray sources are located in the itself , including two not previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> a population of x - ray faint , optically bright , nearby galaxies emerges at soft - band fluxes of @xmath9  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> our multiwavelength correlations have set the tightest constraints to date on the x - ray emission properties of @xmath10jy radio sources , mid - infrared sources detected by , and very red ( @xmath11 ) objects . </S>",
    "<S> sixteen of the 67 1.4  ghz @xmath10jy sources in the caltech area are detected in the x - ray band , and the detection rates for starburst - type and agn - candidate @xmath10jy sources are comparable . only two of the 17 red , optically faint ( @xmath12 ) @xmath10jy sources are detected in x - rays . while many of the starburst - type @xmath10jy sources appear to contain obscured agn , the  data are consistent with the majority of the @xmath10jy radio sources being powered by star formation . </S>",
    "<S> eleven of the @xmath13  mid - infrared sources found in and near the are detected in x - rays . in the itself , where both the infrared and the x - ray coverage are deepest </S>",
    "<S> , it is notable that six of the eight  sources are detected by ; most of these are known to be agn where the x - ray and infrared detections reveal both the direct and indirect accretion power being generated . the high x - ray to infrared matching rate bodes well for future sensitive infrared observations of faint x - ray sources .    </S>",
    "<S> four of the 33 very red objects that have been identified in the caltech area by hogg et  al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000a ) are detected in x - rays ; these four are among our hardest  sources , and we argue that they contain moderately luminous obscured agn . overall , however , the small   detection fraction suggests a relatively small agn content in the optically selected very red object population . </S>",
    "<S> a stacking analysis of the very red objects not detected individually by  yields a soft - band detection with an average soft - band x - ray flux of @xmath14  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 ; the observed emission may be associated with the hot interstellar media of moderate redshift elliptical galaxies .    </S>",
