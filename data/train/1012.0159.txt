    "at the end of the large electron positron ( lep ) operations , an exclusion limit was reached by combining the results of all the higgs search channels performed by its four experiments , establishing a lower limit on @xmath2 of 114.4  @xmath3 at 95% confidence level .",
    "more recently , the direct higgs searches performed by the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron accelerator have reached better sensitivity , making possible the exclusion of a sm higgs boson with a mass between 158 and 174  @xmath3 .",
    "the lhc is continuously collecting luminosity at a center of mass energy of 7  @xmath0 since march 2010 .",
    "the projected luminosity to be delivered before the shut - down to go to higher energies is 10  @xmath4 by november 2010 and 1  @xmath1 by the end of 2011 .    the main production modes for the standard model ( sm ) higgs at 7  @xmath0 at the lhc , presented in fig .  [ production modes ] , are : gluon gluon fusion ( gg ) , dominant in the whole mass ranges ; vector boson fusion ( vbf , qqh ) , increasingly important for high masses and leading to a characteristic signature in the final state with two forward jets and associated production , with w and z boson or top quarks ( wz , zh , t@xmath5h ) , that is relevant in the low mass region and allows for easy triggering .    concerning the decay modes , presented in fig .",
    "[ decay modes ] , for low masses ( @xmath6 ) , h@xmath7b@xmath8 decay has the highest branching ratio , although this channel is experimentally challenging due to the huge qcd background present .",
    "another important decay mode for low masses is h@xmath9 , accessible through vbf , and h@xmath10 , in which the higgs mass peak can be reconstructed with good resolution . for high masses ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the h@xmath7t@xmath5 decay can be studied , however , it presents difficulties in the selection due to the small signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the h@xmath7ww@xmath12 and h@xmath7zz@xmath12 decay channels are powerful in the whole mass range .",
    "the higgs decay into w bosons gives the earliest sensitivity and it is the dominant decay mode for a wide mass range .",
    "higgs to zz@xmath12 has a very clean experimental signature with four leptons where a narrow mass peak is reconstructed above a smoothly varying background .",
    "the higgs searches at cms during the lhc first period of data taking will overlap with the last runs of the tevatron experiments , cdf and d0 . by the end of 2011",
    ", the tevatron is expected to have 10  @xmath1 at a center of mass energy of 1.96  @xmath0 compared with 1  @xmath1 at 7  @xmath0 for the lhc .    to give a rough estimate of the expected performance of lhc with respect to tevatron the different parton luminosities of the two colliders need to be taken into account .    in the high mass regime ( @xmath13 )",
    "gluon gluon luminosity at lhc is more than 15 times higher than at tevatron .",
    "being the dominant background to the main channels ( h@xmath7zz and h@xmath7ww ) mainly produced by q@xmath14 which rises relatively slowly it can be concluded that lhc will be competitive with 1  @xmath1 .",
    "contrary in the low mass region the rise in the cross section is less pronounced and the q@xmath14 processes ( e.g. higgs - strahlung ) are not so favorable at lhc compared to at tevatron .",
    "the signal to background ratio is also worsen by the dominant gluon fusion mechanism which enhances the main backgrounds channels ( e.g t@xmath5 , w / zb@xmath8 ) .",
    "the previous considerations suggest to use the challenging @xmath15 mode .",
    "the cms experiment utilizes a wide range of higgs decay channels and have public results available for different @xmath16 .",
    "the higgs sensitivity at 7  @xmath0 with 1  @xmath1 , has been studied using projections made from the results obtained using monte carlo samples at different center of mass energies , namely 10 and 14  @xmath0 .",
    "these projections are not new analysis done with 7  @xmath0 monte carlo samples and new detector simulation and reconstruction software .",
    "they are done starting from public results at 10 and 14  @xmath0 .",
    "the signal and background event counts have been re - scaled by the ratio of 7  @xmath0 to 14  @xmath0 cross - sections and then normalized to 1  @xmath1 .",
    "no corrections for higher acceptance at smaller @xmath17 or for improvements in the reconstruction are applied .",
    "systematic and statistical uncertainties have been also re - scaled conservatively .",
    "the main higgs search channels relevant for the current running conditions of the lhc will be presented in the following .",
    "the h@xmath7ww@xmath18ll@xmath19 decay channel is considered the discovery channel for a sm higgs boson in a wide mass range at the lhc .",
    "the higgs to ww@xmath20 branching ratio is close to 1 in the 2@xmath21 mass range and the leptonic decay of the w bosons gives a clear experimental signature characterized by the two high p@xmath22 leptons with opposite charge and a small transverse opening angle .",
    "missing transverse energy is also expected , due to the undetected neutrinos .",
    "no central jet activity is characteristic of the gg@xmath7h process while two high rapidity jets are expected for the vbf process ( smaller cross - section ) .    the backgrounds to consider in the analysis are all sources of real or fakes multi - lepton final states and missing e@xmath22 , like the irreducible continuum ww production ( plus other di - boson processes such as wz and zz ) , t@xmath5 process , drell - yan and w+jets , amongst others .",
    "the cms analysis consider the three final states ee , @xmath23 and e@xmath24 . as no mass peak",
    "can be reconstructed due to the presence of the neutrinos , the best knowledge of the backgrounds is mandatory .",
    "this is achieved by using control regions and data - driven methods .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are carefully addressed .",
    "different approaches have been studied . a sequential cut - based analysis independently optimized for",
    "the three considered final states in the 0-jet bin ( h+0j ) , a multivariate analysis considering all the three final states together and a dedicated study for the vbf channel .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of 1  @xmath1 at 7  @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ww exclusion ] and fig .",
    "[ ww discovery ] , exclusion would be possible at 95% cl in this channel from around 140 to 180  @xmath3 , and discovery level sensitivity ( 5@xmath25 ) would be achieved for masses around 165  @xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath7zz@xmath18llll decay channel is known as the golden higgs decay , as it has the cleanest experimental signature for discovery with a narrow four - lepton invariant mass peak on top of a smooth background .",
    "it is powerful in a wide high mass range , however it can be a challenge for higgs masses between 120 and 150  @xmath3 , where one of the z bosons is off - shell .    in the analysis",
    "two pairs of same flavor , opposite - sign leptons ( 4e , 4@xmath24 , 2e2@xmath24 ) , are selected and the higgs mass is reconstructed .",
    "the main backgrounds are the irreducible zz@xmath12 , zb@xmath8 and t@xmath5 . due to the presence of two",
    "non - isolated and displaced leptons the last two can be largely reduced with isolation and impact parameter cuts .",

    ".        however , the higgs boson with a mass @xmath26 would be excluded , if a fourth generation of quarks exists .",
    "indeed an extra doublet of quarks would make the gluon fusion production rate about 9 times larger , regardless of how massive the two extra 4@xmath27 generation quarks might be .      in the low mass range , @xmath28",
    ", h@xmath10 is a promising channel .",
    "two high energy isolated photons in the final state allow for a mass peak reconstruction , but due to the small branching ratio , this channel is considered a high luminosity analysis .",
    "the backgrounds are the irreducible @xmath15 , @xmath29+jets , jets and drell - yan .",
    "the background can be assessed from the sidebands .",
    "cms has proposed two complementary analyzes : a cut - based and an event - by - event kinematic likelihood ratio .    for an integrated luminosity of 1  @xmath1 at 7  @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ gammagamma exclusion ] the sm higgs boson can not be excluded anywhere in the entire mass range .",
    "the case of a fermiophobic higgs would largely suppress the gluon fusion cross section enhancing at the same time the @xmath15 decay mode . under this condition and assuming a conservative selection it would be possible to improve the sm exclusion limit by a factor four or down to 110  @xmath3 .",
    "[ combined exclusion ] shows the projected exclusion limits for a sm higgs by combining results of the h@xmath7ww@xmath12 , h@xmath7zz@xmath12 , and h@xmath10 channels .",
