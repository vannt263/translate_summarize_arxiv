    "this paper considers the occurrence of a phenomenon which appears when we interplay the opposing effects of fragmentation and coalescence .",
    "our setting is that of an adaptation of kingman s coalescent , in which an aggressive form of fragmentation ( splitting blocks up into their constituent elements ) is introduced .",
    "recall that kingman s coalescent describes a system of disjoint subsets covering @xmath4 , later referred to as blocks , such that any individual pair of blocks merge at a constant rate , say @xmath0 , until the system has been reduced to a single block .",
    "suppose we write @xmath5 for the associated law of @xmath6 , the number of blocks in the process , when issued from @xmath7 .",
    "kingman @xcite addresses the question as to whether an entrance law of the chain @xmath8 exists at @xmath9 .",
    "roughly speaking , he proved that , independently of the value of @xmath10 , @xmath11 is well defined in the appropriate sense . in particular , kingman showed that when the coalescent is issued with an infinite number of blocks , it ` comes down from infinity ' meaning that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that , @xmath14-almost surely @xmath15    this is what we refer to by the ` speed ' of coming down from infinity .",
    "kingman s coalescent can be considered as the most basic model within a certain class of so - called exchangeable coalescent processes @xcite in which multiple mergers of blocks are permitted ( irrespective of any notion of their size ) .",
    "berestycki et .",
    "al @xcite show that kingman s coalescent is the ` fastest ' coalescent to come down from infinity , in that @xmath16 , for suitably small @xmath17 , is a lower bound for the number of blocks at time @xmath17 for all such processes .",
    "berestycki @xcite has also studied a very general class of ( exchangeable ) fragmentation - coalescent models , showing , amongst other things , that a stationary distribution always exists .",
    "in addition , he found a subclass of such processes combining kingman s coalescent with certain forms of fragmentation that still come down from infinity . in light of this , we hypothesise that , in order for additionally interesting phenomena to emerge , we must choose a more extreme form of fragmentation to ` compete ' against kingman s coalescent .",
    "the ` fast ' fragmentation - coalescence process that we will work with follows the dynamics of kingman s coalescent , but with the modification that each block in the system , at constant rate @xmath1 , is shattered into its constituent elements .",
    "a more precise definition and construction of the process as an exchangeable fragmentation - coalescent process will be given in section 2 , but for now , we are interested in a markov chain @xmath18 on @xmath19 , which represents the number of blocks in the fast fragmentation - coalescence process .",
    "its transitions are specified by the @xmath20-matrix having entries given by the aforesaid kingman and fragmentation dynamic , so that @xmath21 we are interested in understanding whether the state @xmath22 is absorbing or recurrent for @xmath23 .",
    "that is to say , we want to know whether it is possible to construct a recurrent extension of the process @xmath23 beyond its first hitting time of @xmath22 , when issued from a point in @xmath4 .",
    "the idea that @xmath23 ` comes down from infinity ' is then clearly captured in the notion that the process instantaneously visits @xmath4 after entering the state @xmath22 . in proposition 15 of @xcite , berestycki gives sufficient conditions for an efc process to come down from infinity .",
    "in doing so , he makes assumptions which specifically exclude our setting .",
    "specifically , his assumptions ( l ) and ( h ) are violated by our model as they require that blocks split into a finite number of of sub - blocks at a fragmentation event .",
    "it turns out to be more convenient , however , to study the reciprocal process @xmath24 .",
    "the case that there is a recurrent extension of @xmath25 from 0 corresponds to the ability of the fast fragmentation - coalescence process to come down from infinity .",
    "moreover , if @xmath26 is an absorbing state then the fast fragmentation - coalescence process stays infinite .",
    "it transpires that @xmath27 is the quantity that governs this behaviour .",
    "our main result in this respect is as follows .",
    "[ comedown]@xmath28    1 .   if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 is a recurrent feller process on @xmath31 such that @xmath32 is instantaneously regular ( that is to say @xmath32 is a not a holding point ) and not sticky ( that is to say @xmath33 almost surely ) .",
    "if @xmath34 , then @xmath32 is an absorbing state for @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig ]     integers , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the inset shows detail of typical behaviour near m = 0 ; the red line here illustrates the ` speed ' predicted by theorem [ cdi].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    theorem [ comedown ] @xmath37 also alludes to the existence of an excursion theory for the process @xmath25 away from @xmath32 ( equivalently @xmath23 from @xmath9 ) .",
    "indeed combined with the recurrence properties of the point @xmath32 given in theorem [ comedown ] ( i ) standard theory dictates that a local time exists for @xmath25 at @xmath32 such that its inverse is a pure jump subordinator with infinite activity .",
    "moreover , accompanying this local time is an excursion measure , @xmath38 .",
    "following classical excursion theory in chapter xix.46 of dellacherie and meyer @xcite , we can write down an invariant measure for the transition semi - group of @xmath25 in terms of this excursion measure . on account of the fact that @xmath25 is a bounded recurrent process in @xmath39 $ ]",
    ", we would expect this invariant measure to be a stationary distribution , that is to say , we would expect @xmath25 to possess an ergodic limit . with some additional work",
    ", the next theorem shows that the computations can be pushed even further to obtain an explicit stationary distribution .",
    "[ localtime ] if @xmath29 , then @xmath25 has stationary distribution given by @xmath40 which is a beta - geometric@xmath41 distribution and accordingly its probability generating function can be written in the form @xmath42    another property that can be captured in the recurrent case is that , in the appropriate sense , the rate of coming down from infinity matches that of kingman s coalescent . to this end , let us denote by @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , the probabilities of @xmath25 .",
    "[ cdi ] suppose that @xmath29 .",
    "* let @xmath45 be the expected first hitting time of @xmath46 by @xmath25 under @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 * let @xmath49 denote an excursion of @xmath25 , then @xmath50    we can see the phenomenon in theorem [ cdi ] ( ii ) in figure [ fig ] by zooming on the entrance of an excursion of @xmath25 from @xmath32 .    since the local behaviour of an excursion only has coalescing events as in kingman s coalescent , albeit that the coalescence rates are slightly adjusted to accommodate for suppressing fragmentation , and since @xmath51 one might expect @xmath52 in view of .",
    "in fact , the proof of this result will actually use part of the proof in @xcite .",
    "finally , a natural question in excursion theory is to ask for the hausdorff dimension of the zero set of @xmath25 .",
    "[ hausthm ] suppose @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "then the hausdorff dimension of @xmath55 equals @xmath56 almost surely .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the basis of the analysis as to whether @xmath57 is an absorbing or recurrent state for @xmath25 centres around the representation of our fast fragmentation - coalescent process as a path functional of a richer markov process on the space of exchangeable partitions of the natural numbers .",
    "we therefore commit the next section to addressing this representation .",
    "we then prove the four main results in sections 3 , 4 , 5 & 6 .",
    "we start by reviewing the notion of an exchangeable random partition of the natural numbers .",
    "a partition of @xmath4 is a set of subsets @xmath58 , such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where , for convenience , the blocks are ordered by least element .",
    "we denote the set of partitions of @xmath4 by @xmath62 .",
    "we are also interested in such partitions restricted to @xmath63 , which we denote by @xmath64 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that a partition @xmath65 admits an equivalence relation @xmath66 for some @xmath67 .",
    "suppose @xmath68 is a permutation of @xmath4 with finite support , then it can be applied to @xmath69 to define a new partition @xmath70 using this equivalence relation by letting @xmath71 .",
    "in other words , apply @xmath72 to the blocks of @xmath69 to make the blocks of @xmath70 , then reorder these blocks by least element .",
    "this can be used to define an exchangeable measure .    a sigma - finite measure ,",
    "say @xmath73 , on @xmath62 is said to be exchangeable if for all permutations @xmath68 with finite support , @xmath70 has the same law under @xmath73 as @xmath69",
    ".    we will now state several previous important results to do with exchangeable probability measures .",
    "first , we can link measures on the partition space to mass partition measures .",
    "a mass paritition is a sequence , in decreasing order , @xmath74 , with positive elements that sum to at most 1 , and the space of all mass partitions is denoted @xmath75 . if we have a mass partition * s * , we can use this to partition the unit interval @xmath39 $ ] into subintervals of length @xmath76 we then sample from the uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ] recursively @xmath77 to see where they are positioned in this partition of the unit interval .",
    "we can define a partition @xmath65 ( known as a paintbox ) as follows : @xmath78 note , it may be the case that @xmath79 and so part of the unit interval is not covered by the partition . in this case , if @xmath80 does not land in any of the @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is taken to be a singleton block of @xmath69 .",
    "suppose that for a given @xmath83 we write @xmath84 for the law of the associated paintbox .",
    "kingman @xcite shows that @xmath73 is an exchangeable probability measure if and only if , for @xmath65 , there exists a probability measure , @xmath85 , on @xmath86 such that @xmath87 it is also worthy of note that if @xmath85 is not a probability measure , but instead a sigma - finite measure , then @xmath73 is also an exchangeable sigma - finite measure .",
    "as is suggested by ( [ equivalence ] ) , the asymptotic frequencies of block partitions , defined as @xmath88 exist @xmath73-almost everywhere and , when ranked in decreasing order , correspond in law to @xmath81 under @xmath85 .",
    "a more subtle version of this statement is that all partition blocks contain a either positive fraction of the integers or just a singleton .",
    "moreover if there are singletons , there are infinitely many of them and the union of all of them has positive asymptotic frequency almost surely .",
    "exchangeable fragmentation - coalescence processes ( efc processes ) were introduced by berestycki @xcite with applications in physical chemistry and mathematical genetics ( amongst others ) . in short ,",
    "they superimpose the stochastic mechanisms that drive homogeneous fragmentation processes ( introduced by bertoin @xcite , with other examples from aldous and pitman @xcite , bertoin @xcite and pitman @xcite ) and exchangeable coalescence processes ( first studied by kingman @xcite and later generalised by pitman @xcite , sagitov @xcite , schweinsberg @xcite , and mhle and sagitov @xcite ) .",
    "little has been done on efcs in the probabilistic literature beyond the seminal work of berestycki @xcite and we know only of the works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former computes the stationary distribution for a specific class of efcs ( different from ours ) and the latter considers how other some efcs , which may be regarded as logistic branching processes , can be analysed in the light of a duality relation with certain sdes .",
    "the work we present here adds a third contribution in this respect .",
    "the following definitions are mostly taken from berestycki @xcite .",
    "first , we say that a family of @xmath64-valued processes , @xmath89 , is compatible if the restriction of @xmath90 to @xmath63 is almost surely equal to @xmath91 .",
    "if we have such a family then almost surely this determines a unique @xmath62-valued process @xmath92 such that the restriction of @xmath92 to @xmath63 is @xmath91 .    a @xmath62-valued process @xmath93 , is an efc process if    1 .   for each @xmath94",
    ", @xmath95 is an exchangeable partition 2 .",
    "its restrictions , @xmath91 , are cdlg markov chains which can only evolve by fragmentation of one block or by coagulation .",
    "note , in the above definition , by cdlg , we mean with respect to the metric @xmath96 = \\pi''\\cap[n]\\}$ ] for @xmath97 .",
    "berestycki @xcite shows that all efc processes can be decomposed in terms of two independent poisson point processes , one for coalescence and one for fragmentation . rather than give a full exposition here , we focus on the specific efc that will lead to the fast fragmentation - coalescent process that we are interested in .",
    "in order to do so , we need to define the fragmentation and coalescence operators which will form the dynamics of efc processes .",
    "if we have @xmath98 we define the coagulation of @xmath69 by @xmath99 , written @xmath100 as a third partition @xmath101 where @xmath102    in addition , the fragmentation of the @xmath103 block of @xmath69 by @xmath99 , written @xmath104 is a third partition @xmath105 whose blocks are @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "these blocks may need to be reordered to ensure that they are still ordered by least element . with these dynamics in place",
    "we can define an efc process .",
    "next we need to introduce two measures , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which give the rates at which fragmentation and coalescence will occur in the aforesaid poisson point processes . for all @xmath112",
    "such that @xmath113 , let @xmath114 be the partition which has only one block that is not a singleton , namely the block @xmath115 .",
    "we take @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this is the exchangeable measure which corresponds to all pairs of blocks coalescing at constant rate @xmath10 .    for the fragmentation measure , @xmath111 ,",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , we will work with an extreme case . specifically , if we define @xmath118 , then we take @xmath119 , for @xmath1 .",
    "that is to say , each block is fragmented entirely into its constituent singletons .",
    "this is a valid exchangeable measure as we can take @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the mass partition made of an infinite sequence of zeros .",
    "then , with no erosion present , the paintbox of @xmath122 gives @xmath111 as required .",
    "finally we introduce the two independent poisson point processes and show how they are composed to generate the paths of the exchangeable fast fragmentation - coalescence process ( effc processes ) .",
    "let @xmath123 be a poisson point process on @xmath124 with intensity @xmath125 and let @xmath126 be a poisson point process on @xmath127 with intensity @xmath128 ( here @xmath129 is the counting measure on @xmath4 and we understand the set @xmath130 to take the role of time ) .",
    "pick @xmath131 for the starting value of @xmath92 and we evolve the process @xmath92 according to arrivals as points in @xmath123 and @xmath126 as follows . if @xmath17 is not an atom time of @xmath123 or @xmath126 then @xmath132 . if @xmath17 is an atom time of @xmath123 , then @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the accompanying mark in @xmath62 at the atom time @xmath17 . finally , if @xmath17 is a an atom time of @xmath126 then @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the accompanying mark in @xmath137 at the atom time @xmath17 .",
    "a direct consequence of this construction is that @xmath92 is a strong markov process .",
