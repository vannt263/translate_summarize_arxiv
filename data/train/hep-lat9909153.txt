    "defining chiral fermions on the lattice has been one of long - standing problems in lattice field theories .",
    "several years ago , domain - wall fermion @xcite has been proposed as a new formulation of lattice chiral fermion .",
    "this formulation considers wilson fermion in @xmath3 dimensions with the free boundary condition in the extra dimension of a size @xmath0 , or equivalently , @xmath0-flavored wilson fermions with flavor mixing . in the limit @xmath4 , the spectrum of free domain - wall fermion ( dwf ) contains massless modes at the edges in the extra dimension .",
    "the massless modes are stable under perturbation from weak gauge fields .",
    "while there have been numerical simulations of lattice qcd with dwf ( dwqcd ) , some non - perturbative issues , in particular existence of the parity - broken phase ( aoki phase)@xcite and necessity of fine tuning of couplings to restore chiral symmetry for finite @xmath0 , have not been clarified . in order to answer these questions",
    ", we investigate the two - dimensional lattice gross  neveu model using the dwf formalism ( dwgn ) @xcite as a test of dwqcd .",
    "we propose the following action for dwgn : @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{eq : gnterm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the auxiliary fields are related to fermion condensates as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the important point in this action is that the interaction terms are constructed from the edge state : @xmath8 .",
    "we attempt to solve dwgn analytically in the large @xmath9 limit .",
    "the effective potential can be calculated by the technique of the propagator matrix@xcite , which yields @xmath10 ~ , \\label{eq : effpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "the explicit form of the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are described in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us note that the term @xmath14 explicitly breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    the phase diagram of the wilson fermion action has a region of spontaneously broken parity - flavor symmetry ( aoki phase ) , which plays an important role for controlling restoration of chiral symmetry in the continuum limit@xcite .",
    "since dwf is an extension of the wilson fermion formalism , we wish to examine if aoki phase exists for dwgn . in this section",
    ", we set the coupling constants as @xmath15 .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath16 . since @xmath17 and @xmath13 dominates over the term @xmath18 in this limit , the effective potential becomes @xmath19~.\\ ] ] the @xmath1 term , which breaks chiral symmetry , is absent , and hence the model has exact chiral symmetry .",
    "thus pion becomes massless without fine tuning even for finite lattice spacings and for arbitrary strong coupling .",
    "next we consider the case of finite @xmath0 .",
    "it is expected that aoki phase exists in this case since the @xmath20 dwgn is equivalent to gn model with wilson fermion@xcite .",
    "the solution of the gap equation marking the phase boundary is illustrated for several values of @xmath21 with a fixed size @xmath22 in fig.[fig : ns2 ] . as is summarized in a schematic diagram in fig.[fig : illust1 ] , we find that ( i ) aoki phase exists inside the boundary and this boundary forms cusps toward @xmath23 , ( ii ) the aoki phase always appears in the @xmath24 region for even @xmath0 ( in the conventional choice of sign in domain - wall literatures , this corresponds to @xmath25 ) , ( iii ) pion becomes massless on the boundary .",
    "the last point means that pion mass does not vanish at @xmath26 for finite lattice spacing .",
    "hence a fine tuning is needed to obtain massless pion .    in fig.[fig",
    ": mns ] we show the @xmath0 dependence of the phase boundary for @xmath27 and @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "we find that ( i ) the aoki phase shrinks exponentially with @xmath0 , ( ii ) the first `` finger '' on the left approaches @xmath26 , while other `` fingers '' move toward @xmath30 , ( iii ) the critical value @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig : illust1 ] ) , below which the cusp structure ( `` fingers '' ) appears , increases exponentially with @xmath0 , in contrast to the case of wilson fermion@xcite .",
    "these features mean that the area of the normal phase becomes wide with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "as seen from above , dwf for finite @xmath0 represents an improved wilson fermion .",
    "= 7.5 cm    we study the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration in the continuum limit . in particular , we wish to understand scaling violation for finite and infinite @xmath0 .",
    "the effective potential in the continuum limit is obtained after some calculation : @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which is the normalization factor of the edge state `` @xmath37 '' for finite @xmath0 . in order to obtain ( [ eq : effpot1 ] ) , which agrees with the continuum result , we need to impose the following scaling relations : @xmath38 these relations are the same with those found for the wilson fermion case @xcite .",
    "therefore a fine tuning is needed to restore chiral symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : obs_a - mfix ] shows @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 for @xmath29 , using the wilson - like scaling relations in ( [ eq : gsgtuning]-[eq : tuning ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath1 scaling violation is large at @xmath41 .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath1 scaling violation diminishes exponentially as @xmath0 increases .",
    "in fact the scaling curve almost exactly follows the @xmath42 behavior for @xmath43 .",
    "we have investigated the two - dimensional dwgn model in detail as a test of dwqcd .",
    "when the size of the extra dimension @xmath16 , the model has chiral symmetry for finite lattice spacing , and aoki phase does not exist . on the other hand , in the case of finite @xmath0 , aoki phase does exist and a fine tuning is needed to restore chiral symmetry in the continuum limit . however , the @xmath1 scaling violation that gives rise to this behavior vanishes exponentially fast as @xmath0 is increased so that it is negligible in practice for @xmath44 .",
    "while the gn model does not have gauge fields and quantum fluctuations are absent in the large @xmath9 limit , it is expected that the results obtained in this work provide instructive and systematic information for dwqcd simulations ."
