    "the cef ground state often possesses the orbital degeneracy , which can be lifted by multipolar orderings , such as quadrupolar and octupolar orderings@xcite .",
    "we have focused on a series of ternary compounds of ce - pd - x ( x = si , ge and p ) with the c@xmath2cr@xmath3-type structure@xcite , because this system provides a unique opportunity of systematic investigation of multipolar effects .",

    "the other method was a direct reaction of a pelletized mixture of ce pieces , pd sponge and as grains .",
    "the pellet in a carbon crucible was placed in an evacuated quartz tube , heated to 400@xmath12c , held at that temperature for 16 h and further heated to 900 @xmath12c ( or 1000@xmath12c ) , held at that temperature for 10 h. the reference compound la@xmath0pd@xmath1as@xmath2 was also synthesized by the direct reaction of la pieces , pd sponge and as grains at 900 @xmath12c , followed by sintering at 900 @xmath12c for 3 days after regrinding .",
