    "<S> in this paper , we give a purely geometric approach to the local jacquet - langlands correspondence for @xmath0 over a @xmath1-adic field , under the assumption that the invariant of the division algebra is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath3-adic tale cohomology of the drinfeld tower to construct the correspondence at the level of the grothendieck groups with rational coefficients . moreover , assuming that @xmath4 is prime , we prove that this correspondence preserves irreducible representations . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a purely local proof of the local jacquet - langlands correspondence in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we need neither a global automorphic technique nor detailed classification of supercuspidal representations of @xmath0 .    </S>",
