    "it is one of the `` nebulae '' included in the studies of hubble ( 1926 ) , and noted as having high - excitation emission lines by seyfert ( 1943 ) .",
    "the nucleus has since been shown to possess a seyfert 1 spectrum ( e.g. khachikian & weedman 1974 ) , and since been studied extensively at all accessible wavebands from radio to x - rays ( e.g. see arribas et al 1997 ; guainazzi , marshall , parmar 2001 ; and references therein ) .",

    "however , more recent , deeper maps at 20 and 6  cm have also revealed a series of `` blobs '' forming an elongated , curved structure extending out to @xmath020  arcsec ( @xmath23  kpc ) to the ne ( baum et al .",
    "1993 ; miyaji , wilson & prez - fournon 1992 ) . a much weaker , radio counter - structure to the sw of the nucleus has also been suggested ( wrobel & heeschen 1988 ) but , as yet , has not been confirmed .    in the optical and uv",

    "the kinematic studies of this extended narrow emission line region ( enlr ) show peculiar motions ( e.g. ulrich , pquignot 1980 ) while the stellar velocity field appears normal ( arribas et al .",
    "it has been suggested that the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas are the result of a bent , bipolar outflow from the nucleus or due to entrainment within a precessing radio jet ( e.g. veilleux , tully , bland - hawthorn 1993 ; ferruit et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from ngc  3516 was first detected in 1979 by the imaging proportional counter on board the _ einstein observatory _",
    "( e.g. maccacaro , garilli & mereghetti 1987 ) , and studied by all the major x - ray observatories since .",
    "the x - ray continuum exhibits spectral and temporal characteristics common to seyfert 1 galaxies , including fe k@xmath27 emission , absorption due to ionized gas ( a `` warm absorber '' ) and an apparently variable power law continuum ( e.g. guainazzi et al 2001 , and references therein ) .",

    "rosat_. morse et al . (",
    "1995 ) found an elongation in x - ray emission on scales 1030  arcsec ( 1.75@xmath28  kpc ) approximately aligned with enlr described above .",
    "however , as noted by morse et al .",
    ", this elongation could be the result of residual errors in the spacecraft aspect solution .",
    "the morphology of any extended x - ray emission within 10  arcsec could not be studied in these hri data since any such emission was swamped by the instrumentally - scattered emission from the nucleus .",
    "here we present new x - ray data from ngc  3516 obtained with high spatial - resolution using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ) .",

    "we discuss our findings and present our conclusions in  [ sec : disc ] . throughout",
    "we assume a galactic column density of @xmath29 appropriate for this line of sight ( murphy et al 1996 ) .",
    "the data from ngc  3516 reported here were obtained from three observations using the _ cxo _ : a 47  ks observation in 2000 september , and two observations ( of approximately 40  ks and 75  ks respectively ) in 2001 april ( see table  1 ) .",
    "all observations were performed with the `` s - array '' of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis : e.g. nousek et al 1998 ) in the focal plane ( with a temperature of @xmath30  c ) . the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs : e.g. brinkman et al .",
    "1997 ) was in the optical path during the earlier observation , while the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs : e.g. markert et al .",
    "1994 ) was in place during the latter observations .",
    "in all cases , the zeroth - order image of the nucleus of ngc  3516 was close to the optical axis of the telescope and fell on the ( back - illuminated ) acis - s3 chip .",
    "here we restrict our analysis to the non - nuclear emission detected using the zeroth - order from the respective gratings .",
    "the results from the nucleus of ngc  3516 are discussed in netzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and turner et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    for completeness , we review a number of general characteristics associated with the configuration of the telescope and detector .",
    "firstly , the acis pixels are 0.492  arcsec on a side ( @xmath31  kpc at the assumed distance to ngc  3516 ) .",
    "the x - ray telescope has a fwhm of 0.84  arcsec at energies @xmath32  kev ( the presence of neither the letgs nor the hetgs in the optical path is thought to degrade this significantly ) .",
    "thus the zeroth - order image of bright sources will be `` piled - up '' in their central pixel(s ) , and hence exhibit an artificial deficit of photons in the central pixel(s ) .",
    "secondly , the images of bright sources will also exhibit a read - out stripe .",
    "thirdly , with the gratings in the optical path , the dispersed ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35order etc . )",
    "spectra will be projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "for example , in the @xmath33order , the letgs still has significant effective area ( @xmath36 ) at 9  kev .",
    "such photons will appear @xmath3729  arcsec from the zeroth  order image .",
    "in all subsequent analysis , the above effects have been taken into account as follows .",
    "we ignore all events detected within 1  arcsec ( approximately 2  acis pixels ) of the position expected ( and detected ) due to the zeroth ",
    "order position of the target source ( i.e , the nucleus of ngc  3516 ) .",
    "`` pile - up '' is of negligible concern here since we do not discuss the nuclear emission .",
    "in addition , on an observation - by - observation basis , we give zero - weight to all events within @xmath38  pixel of the read - out stripe . finally , outside a radius 25  arcsec we give zero - weight to all events within a polar angle @xmath39  degrees of the location of the dispersed spectra .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the _ chandra _ caldb ( v2.7 ) , and the ciao ( v2.0.3 ) and heasoft ( v5.1 ) software packages .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were followed , including the removal of the `` streaks '' from the acis ccds ( using destreak v  1.3 ; houck 2000 ) , the selection of events with well - understood `` grades '' array of ccd pixels . only grades equivalent to `` _ asca _ grades '' 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 are used here . ] , and the correction of a known error in the aspect solution for the first observation .",
    "a bright point - like source is clearly evident in each observation consistent ( within the uncertainties of the _ cxo _ aspect reconstruction ) with the position of the nucleus of ngc  3516 ( ra=11h  06 m  47.490s , dec=+72d  34 m  06.88s , with a 95% confidence radius of 0.25s ; clements 1981 ) .",
    "the residual errors in the aspect solutions ( see table  1 ) were corrected manually , and the events then re - projected onto a common tangent - plane projection ( centered on the optical nucleus ) .    in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] we show the images of the circumnuclear region in the 0.21  kev and 48  kev bands .",
    "the soft band image reveals an off - nuclear source @xmath06  arcsec ( @xmath40  kpc ) to the nne ( position angle @xmath029  degrees ) of the nucleus of ngc  3516 , and extended emission in the ne  sw direction stretching out to approximately 10  arcsec ( @xmath41  kpc ) from the nucleus . at high energies only the nucleus of ngc  3516",
    "is detected , illustrating that neither the extended emission nor the off - nuclear source are obvious artifacts of the _ cxo _ aspect reconstruction .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] we show the corresponding radial point spread functions ( rpsfs ) from the ne and sw quadrants . for comparison also shown ( the black histograms ) are corresponding rpsfs from the two archival hetgs observations of the bright quasar 3c  273 currently available to us , superimposed on the the ambient background .",
    "( the known x - ray jet in 3c  273 was excluded from the calculation . ) in the 0.21  kev band , excess emission is clearly seen in ngc  3516 in both the ne and sw quadrants at radii @xmath0310  arcsec ( @xmath00.51.7 @xmath28  kpc ) .",
    "the spike in the rpsf of the ne quadrant at @xmath06  arcsec is due to the off - nuclear source .",
    "in contrast , the rpsf in the 48  kev band are consistent with the instrumental profile ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] ) .",
    "for the subsequent analysis we make use of data extracted using the following regions .",
    "the first region is a circle of radius 1.8  arcsec centered on the off - nuclear source ( ie .",
    "equivalent to 42 acis pixels ) .",
    "hereafter we refer to this region as the `` off - nuclear source cell '' .",
    "the second region encompasses the extended emission , namely the ne and sw quadrant of an annulus stretching from 310  arcsec from the nucleus of ngc  3516 ( excluding the region around the off - nuclear source ) .",
    "this region encompasses 290 acis pixels , and hereafter we refer to it as the `` extended cell '' .",
    "the third region is used as a background region and consists of the ne and sw quadrant of an annulus stretching from 10 - 20  arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "this region encompasses 1545 acis pixels , and hereafter referred to as the `` background cell '' .    in fig.[fig :",
    "spec_perpix ] we show the counts spectra _ per pixel _ from each of these regions .",
    "it should be noted that due to the different transmission characteristics of the letgs and hetgs , the effective area is different for each grating / detector combination .",
    "these are shown in the lower panels of fig.[fig : spec_perpix ] , and necessitate separate spectral analysis of the two datasets .",
    "astrometry using the position of the optical nucleus of ngc  3516 gives a location of the off - nuclear source at ( j2000 ) ra=11h  06 m  48.1s , dec=+72d  34 m  12.5s , with an uncertainty of @xmath01  arcsec . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first detection of a distinct source at this location and we designate it cxou  110648.1 + 723412",
    ".    in the letgs data set a total of 57 counts were detected in the 0.28  kev band from the off - nuclear source cell .",
    "a total of 114 counts were detected in this band from this cell in the hetgs data set .",
    "the ambient backgrounds in this band , derived using the extended cell ( renormalising by the ratios of the areas of the cells ) are 8 counts in the letgs and 20 counts in the hetgs data sets .    as illustrated in fig.[fig : spec_perpix ] , cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is significantly detected in the @xmath00.34  kev band in both the letgs and hetgs data sets . however , with so few net counts , clearly only limited temporal and spectral information is available .",
    "we have grouped the spectra such that each new bin contained at least 20 counts , hence allowing an analysis using @xmath42-statistics .",
    "this resulted in only 2 bins for the letgs data set , and 5 bins for the hetgs data set .",
    "we find the spectra at all epochs to be consistent with a simple power - law continuum , a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum , or emission from a collisionally ionized plasma .",
    "for the power - law continuum , for which we obtain a best - fit with a reduced @xmath42-statistic , @xmath43 = 1.90 for 5 degrees of freedom ( @xmath44 ) , the 90% confidence ranges for the photon index @xmath45 ) , flux and luminosity in the 0.42  kev band ( the latter after correcting for @xmath46 , assuming isotropic emission and a location within ngc  3516 ) are @xmath47 , @xmath48(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath49@xmath50 , and @xmath51(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath52@xmath53 . for the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum ( @xmath54 = 1.99/5 )",
    ", we find the temperature in the range @xmath55(kev)@xmath56 , @xmath48(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath57@xmath58 , and @xmath51(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "for a collisionally ionized plasma ( @xmath54 = 2.24/4 ) , we require the abundance of all elements to be @xmath61% of their cosmic values , the temperature in the range @xmath62(kev)@xmath63 , @xmath48(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath64@xmath65 , and @xmath51(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath66@xmath67 . for these models , we find no requirement for absorption in excess of @xmath46 , although the constraints that can be placed on any such component are poor ( typically @xmath68few@xmath69 ) . for future reference , at 90% confidence we find an upper limit of the flux in the 48  kev band of @xmath70 .",
    "it should be noted that the above results do not change significantly if the background from the background cell is used instead of that from the extended cell .",
    "such an approach would be more appropriate if the emission from within the extended cell was the result of a relatively few faint , discrete sources rather than truly - uniform , extended emission .",
    "it is possible that cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is extended .",
    "indeed our spatial analysis reveals evidence for some extension on a scale @xmath00.5  arcsec ( @xmath71  kpc ) .",
    "however given the co - addition of several observations , and the likely presence of ( probably patchy ) underlying extended emission , further observations are required to investigate this possibility .",
    "the region used to extract the extended emission consists of 290 acis pixels ( @xmath72 ) in the ne and sw quadrant of an annulus stretching from 310  arcsec from the nucleus of ngc  3516 ( excluding the region around cxou  110648.1 + 723412 ) .",
    "unfortunately there are insufficient counts per pixel to determine whether the x - ray emission from this region is smooth , patchy , and/or due to a relatively small number of discrete sources .",
    "thus below we discuss the `` mean '' x - ray characteristics of this region .",
    "totals of 55 and 141 counts were detected in the 0.28  kev band from this region in the letgs and hetgs data sets ( respectively ) .",
    "renormalising for the areas , from the background cell we estimate ambient backgrounds of 29 and 76 counts in the extended cell ( respectively ) .",
    "as illustrated in fig.[fig : spec_perpix ] , extended emission is significantly detected in the @xmath00.34  kev band in the letgs data set , and at most energies in the @xmath00.36  kev band in the hetgs data set .",
    "however , as for cxou  110648.1 + 723412 , there are again clearly too few net counts for detailed temporal or spectral analysis . grouping the spectra such that each new bin contained at least 20 counts results in 2 bins for the letgs data set , and 7 bins for the hetgs data set .",
    "we find the spectra to be formally consistent with a power law continuum ( @xmath54 = 0.83/7 ) , with 90% confidence ranges of @xmath73 , @xmath48(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath74@xmath75 , and @xmath51(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum is also acceptable ( @xmath54 = 0.97/7 ) , with @xmath78(kev)@xmath79 , @xmath48(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath80@xmath81 , ( @xmath82@xmath83 ) , and @xmath51(0.4 - 2  kev ) @xmath76@xmath84 ( @xmath85@xmath86 ) .",
    "clearly a number of more complex spectral forms are also consistent with the data .",
    "we find no requirement for absorption in excess of @xmath46 , although again the constraints that are placed on any such component are poor with the current data ( @xmath68few@xmath69 ) .",
    "the current data have too low a signal - to - noise ratio to determine whether the spectra from the ne and sw quadrants differ ( e.g. whether they suffer different amounts of intrinsic absorption as might be expected if they lie on different sides of the galactic plane ) . as for cxou  110648.1 + 723412 , at 90% confidence the upper limit of the flux in the 48  kev band is @xmath70 .",
    "the spatial resolution of _ cxo _ finally allows the innermost regions ( @xmath681  kpc ) of the nearest galaxies to be probed in x - rays .",
    "already observations have shown that besides point sources ( many of which appear to be emitting at super - eddington luminosities ) , a large fraction of galaxies have extended x - ray emission on scales @xmath00.51.5  kpc ( see weaver 2001 for a recent review ) .",
    "furthermore , this extended x - ray emission often has an anisotropic morphology , and is aligned with other anisotropic structures such as the radio emission and/or enlr .",
    "the data presented here show that ngc  3516 fits into this picture .",
    "we have found a distinct off - nuclear source ( cxou  110648.1 + 723412 ) which is embedded within the extended x - ray emission @xmath87  arcsec ( @xmath1  kpc ) nne of the nucleus .",
    "more interestingly , we have found extended x - ray emission in the @xmath00.34  kev band , detected out to a radius @xmath7  arcsec ( @xmath41  kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "the extended emission appears to be anisotropically distributed in the ne ",
    "sw direction , although instrumental artifacts ( most notably the read - out streak associated with the relatively - bright nuclear emission ) prevent us from being certain .",
    "however we do note that an elongation in this direction was suggested by morse et al .",

    "( 1998 ) , the morphology of the [ oiii ] emission is complex , but shows a distinct anisotropy in the ne ",
    "sw direction .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] compares the [ oiii ] and soft x - ray morphologies .",
    "clearly there appears to be good agreement between the alignments .",
    "the source cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is highly likely to be located within the galaxy ngc  3516 .",
    "the density of background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at this flux level in the 0.52  kev band is @xmath89 per square degree ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) , thus the probability of a background source within 6  arcsec of the nucleus of ngc  3516 is @xmath90 .",
    "similarly the probability that the emission is due to a foreground ( galactic ) source is at least a factor 2 lower ( e.g. kuntz & snowden 2001 ) .    as stated in ",
    "[ sec : serendip ] , based on the data currently available we can not determine unambiguously whether cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is a true point - source , or a relatively small , but diffuse , enhancement in the extended emission . if it is a point - source , indeed located in ngc  3516 and emitting isotropically , then its x - ray luminosity ( @xmath91  kev@xmath9228@xmath5 ) is above the eddington luminosity for a @xmath6 neutron star .",
    "such `` super - luminous '' off - nuclear sources are being regularly found by _ cxo _",
    "( e.g. griffiths et al . 2000 ; fabbiano , zezas , murray 2001 ; george et al 2001 ; pence et al 2001 ) with similar spectral characteristics as cxou  110648.1 + 723412 .",
    "alternatively , cxou  110648.1 + 723412 could be the result of the superposition of several sub - eddington sources , or simply a local enhancement within the diffuse emission .",
    "unfortunately , given the fwhm of the _ rosat _ hri ( @xmath0 4 arcsec ) , plus the additional blurring due to errors in the aspect solution , the x - ray emission detected by the hri at the location of cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is dominated by that from the nucleus itself ( e.g. see morse et al .",
    "thus , no useful constraints can be placed on the long - term variability characteristics cxou  110648.1 + 723412 at this time .",
    "higher - quality x - ray spectra and temporal studies are required to determine the origin of this emission .",
    "interestingly , as can be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] , cxou  110648.1 + 723412 is located just n of the [ oiii ] e  w linear structure to the ne of the nucleus . the lack of [ oiii ] emission in the immediate vicinity of the x - ray source may be the result of its radiation field photo - ionizing oxygen to oiv and higher .",
    "there are several possible origins for the extended x - ray emission reported here",
    ". clearly it might not be truly extended emission at all , instead being the result ( at least in part ) of a relatively - small number of faint , discrete sources .",
    "certainly we see one clear discrete source , cxou  110648.1 + 723412 , and there are some indications of patchiness within the rest of the extended emission .",
    "the current _ cxo _ data simply do not have sufficient signal - to - noise to usefully constrain the possibility .",
    "nevertheless , if the observed x - ray emission is ( primarily ) extended , then it may be the result of emission from hot , collisionally - ionized gas , perhaps related to the presence of active star - forming regions .",
    "alternatively , the extended x - ray emission may be produced by gas photo - ionized by the intense nuclear radiation field , and include the electron - scattering of the nuclear radiation .",
    "such gas may be related to the bulk outflow known to exist in this source ( e.g. hutchings et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) , perhaps as a result of a `` wind '' from the inner regions ( e.g. pietrini , torricelli - ciamponi 2000 ; krolik , kriss 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "of course at least some of the gas could be under the influence of both collisional- and photo - ionization processes . in principle",
    "the dominant ionization mechanism can be determined from a detailed study of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "unfortunately the current _ cxo _ data simply do not have sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "diffuse emission in the 0.42  kev band , with a luminosity @xmath68few@xmath93 , has been detected from the inner few kpc of a number of galaxies .",
    "these include `` classic '' agn ( e.g. the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc  4151 ; ogle et al .",
    "2000 , and the seyfert 2 galaxies circinus and ngc  1068 ; sambruna et al . 2001 ; young , wilson , shopbell 2001 ) , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. mrk  273 ; xia et al 2001 ) , and galaxies with low - luminosity agn ( e.g. m51 ; terashima & wilson 2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , however , extended x - ray emitting gas with similar characteristics has also been observed in a number of `` normal '' galaxies ( e.g. the starburst galaxy m82 ; grifffiths et al .",
    "2000 , the nearby spiral m81 ; tennant et al . 2001 , and the sa galaxy ngc  1291 ; irwin , sarazin & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "thus it is not clear how ( if at all ) the diffuse x - ray emission in ngc  3516 might be related to the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "nevertheless it is of interest to explore the case where the extended emission arises solely as a result of electron - scattering of the nuclear radiation field .",
    "if we assume that the electrons are distributed in clouds , which have a volume filling factor , @xmath94 , then for a radius @xmath95 , the luminosity of the scattered radiation is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 be the mean ( time - averaged ) luminosity of the nuclear source , and @xmath98 the thomson cross - section .",
    "the luminosity of the nucleus is known to be variable .",
    "here we simply assume the approximate average luminosity of the observations made to date , namely @xmath97(0.42  kev ) @xmath99 . from  [ sec : xtended ] , @xmath100(0.42  kev ) @xmath101 , thus for @xmath102  kpc , @xmath103 .",
    "the x - ray ionization parameter ( defined over the 0.110  kev band ) is @xmath104 and the column density ( out to 2  kpc ) is @xmath105 . unless @xmath106 , this combination of @xmath107 and @xmath108 imply the gas is indeed highly ionized and hence our assumptions are valid .",
    "the strongest spectral features emitted by such gas are likely to be cvi , ovii , oviii , and neix recombination continua and emission lines .",
    "we note that similar features have been observed in x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  1068 ; young , wilson , & shopbell 2001 ) .",
    "we also note that under the above assumptions , the extended gas has a significantly smaller column density than the `` warm - absorbers '' seen in seyfert 1 galaxies ( typically @xmath109@xmath110 , e.g. george et al .",
    "indeed , netzer et al ( 2002 ) have shown that the warm - absorber in ngc  3516 has a column density @xmath111 , a density @xmath112few@xmath113 , and is located at a radius @xmath1140.5  pc from the nucleus .",
    "thus these data do not support the idea that the gas responsible for the warm absorbers seen in seyfert 1 galaxies is the same gas that is seen as extended x - ray emission in seyfert 2 galaxies .    finally ,",
    "if the extended x - ray emitting gas is indeed photo - ionized , then for @xmath115 its temperature is @xmath116 . thus @xmath117 few@xmath118 . as implicit from  [ sec : intro ] , the extended x - ray emitting gas appears to be co - spatial with the enlr in ngc  3516 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] ) .",
    "photo - ionization models of the optical line ratios observed from gas responsible for the enlr give @xmath119few @xmath120 few @xmath121 ( e.g. ulrich & pquignot 1980 ; aoki et al .",
    "hence the pressure ratio between the gas responsible for the extended x - ray emission and enlr is @xmath122 .",
    "the two are not in pressure equilibrium so the x - ray emitting gas can not be the confining medium for the enlr clouds .",
    "such a situation has also been found in the case of ngc  4151 ( ogle et al .",
    ". there may well be other effects such as a dynamical interaction between these two gaseous components , but an exploration of this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",

    "<S> a previously - unknown x - ray source is detected @xmath06  arcsec ( @xmath1  kpc ) nne of the nucleus ( position angle @xmath029  degrees ) which we designate cxou  110648.1 + 723412 . </S>",
    "<S> its spectrum can be characterized as a power law with a photon index @xmath21.82.6 , or as thermal emission with a temperature @xmath30.73  kev . assuming a location within ngc  3516 </S>",
    "<S> , isotropic emission implies a luminosity @xmath428@xmath5 in the 0.42  kev band . if due to a single point source , the object is super - eddington for a @xmath6 neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> however , multiple sources or a small , extended source can not be excluded using the current data . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale extended x - ray emission is also detected out to @xmath7  arcsec ( @xmath8  kpc ) from the nucleus to the ne and sw , and is approximately aligned with the morphologies of the radio emission and extended narrow emission line region ( enlr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean luminosity of this emission is 15@xmath9 , in the 0.42  kev band . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the current data can not usefully constrain its spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with earlier suggestions of circumnuclear x - ray emission in ngc  3516 . </S>",
    "<S> if the extended emission is due to scattering of the nuclear x - ray continuum , then the pressure in the x - ray emitting gas is at least two orders of magnitude too small to provide the confining medium for the enlr clouds . </S>"
