    "golubchik and sokolov @xcite recently discussed systems of ordinary differential equations which are integrable by the standard factorisation method of adler - kostant - symes @xcite or the generalised factorisation method @xcite .",
    "they established relationships between such reductions , operator yang - baxter equations and some kinds of nonassociative algebras . in their paper @xcite a number of specific examples was given without much detailed comment on the solutions except for the possibility of the system passing or not passing the painlev test .",
    "the examples are as follows : @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 in which greek letters are constants .",
    "we have given the sets of equations in the order and the form as presented by @xcite .",
    "the integrability of these systems , apart from the two - dimensional system in , is not immediately obvious , although in the paper of golubchik and sokolov @xcite we are informed that they are so constructed to be integrable in the sense of the generalised factorisation method .",
    "unfortunately they do not connect this definition of integrability with the usual ones which are as follows :    \\(a ) the existence of an explicit solution relating the variables , not necessarily the dependent variables as explicit functions of the independent variable , or , in the instance of systems , a number of explicit independent functions equal to the number of the dependent variables ;    \\(b ) the existence of a sufficient number of independent first integrals and invariants which could be used to give a local version via the implicit function theorem of ( a ) above ;    \\(c ) the existence of a sufficient number of symmetries either to reduce the differential equations of the system to algebraic equations or to obtain the independent first integrals and invariants of ( b ) above ;    \\(d ) the passing of the painlev test , either in the normal form or the weak form , which , in the form as given by conte @xcite , will guarantee the existence of a solution as required by ( a ) above that is analytic in the complex @xmath5-plane or in a region of it apart from isolated moveable singularities which are poles or algebraic branch points .",
    "the only hint which the two authors give is their comment associated with to the effect that for general values of the parameter @xmath6 , one would not expect the system to pass the painlev - kovalevskaya test .",
    "one infers from this that they are not looking for a solution which is analytic apart from isolated singularities which are either poles or algebraic and so one can presume that they intend ( a ) above",
    ".    there are those who would insist that a solution be a ( single - valued ) function ( cf conte @xcite ) and , in the strict mathematical sense , they are quite correct . however , in practice the domain of the variable , @xmath5 , in which the solution is going to be used is much smaller than the complex @xmath5-plane .",
    "it is with this emphasis on the practicality of applications that ( a ) above is proposed .",
    "it is the intention of this paper to take up the systems enumerated above where the authors of @xcite left them .",
    "we shall see that the solutions of these systems of equations have certain interesting aspects which illustrates various properties of differential equations .",
    "the most obvious one is that all of the systems quoted are quadratic systems which are of tremendous interest in many areas of mathematical modelling ranging from studies of population systems to the reactions in chemical systems .",
    "they , along with the closely related lotka - volterra systems , are usually studied from the point of view of dynamical systems since in general they are not integrable , but are well adapted for intensive and informative qualitative investigation .",
    "nevertheless there has been a number of studies of these systems and the circumstances under which they possess first integrals and/or invariants @xcite .",
    "the connection between the possession of the painlev property and the existence of first integrals / invariants has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "a less obvious property of the systems presented by golubchik and sokolov is that all of them possess the two point symmetries of invariance under time translation and the selfsimilar transformation",
    ". these two symmetries immediately make them interesting from the point of view of the painlev property since there is a very close relationship between the nature of the singularity and the specific form of the selfsimilar symmetry @xcite .",
    "the selfsimilar symmetry permits an analysis of the next to leading order behaviour and the painlev property follows from this when the next to leading order behaviour becomes a laurent expansion about the singularity @xcite .",
    "there is the question whether the possession of the two symmetries mentioned above is sufficient to guarantee integrability . as we have been informed in @xcite ,",
    "all of these systems are integrable , we have an excellent opportunity to examine the symmetry structure of these systems and equations related to them in the knowledge that the results will characterise integrable systems .",
    "of course it is an open question whether the examination will lead to a clear result .",
    "we defer our comments on the question until the conclusion .",
    "however , our path to the conclusion will reveal a number of interesting features of these systems and their connections to other well known facets of integrable systems .    on the presumption that complexity of appearance is a representative of complexity of fact we shall more or less work backwards through the list of systems above and attempt to examine them in increasing order of difficulty . in the case of some of the systems we make",
    "use of rescaling to make them look simpler .",
    "this may simply be a psychological trick , but it is one worth practising on all occasions .",
    "one of our principal activities will be the examination of these systems and any derivate equations for their lie symmetries . as an aid in this examination we make use of program lie @xcite to attend to the dirty business of the calculation of the symmetries .",
    "this program , which is one of the more successful analysers for symmetry , is freely available on simtel sites .",
    "naturally we shall also be concerned with the possession of the painlev - kovalevskaya property either by a direct computation or by a consideration of the structure of the solution of the system of equations .",
    "before we commence our analysis we mention some terminology introduced in reference @xcite . in systems of differential equations invariant under time translation and rescaling",
    "all terms contribute to the dominant behaviour .",
    "however , it is possible that a subset of terms has an additional or different rescaling property .",
    "this symmetry is termed ` subselfsimilarity ' and the terms possessing this symmetry are called ` subdominant ' .",
    "these terms also have to be analysed for possession of the painlev property , naturally with compability at the resonances no longer guaranteed .",
    "a simple example of the possession of subselfsimilarity is the generalised chazy equation @xmath7 the equation as a whole has the two symmetries @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the second and third terms have the two homogeneity symmetries @xmath10 and @xmath11 and so would also have to be analysed separately .    finally we note that this is the first in a series of papers devoted to the intertwined subjects of symmetry , singularity and integrability . the second paper in the series @xcite treats the singularity analysis and integrability of the class of second order equations invariant under time - translation and rescaling and the third @xcite some aspects of complete symmetry groups @xcite .",
    "we rewrite , @xmath12 as    [ 2.2 ] @xmath13    when we perform the painlev analysis on the system , we find that , using the usual notations and methods , the singularity corresponding to the selfsimilar symmetry of the system gives the following behaviour @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the location of the movable singularity and @xmath17 is the second arbitrary constant of integration , which indicates the weak painlev property implied in the solution ( see )",
    ".    there is also the possibility of a different type of singular behaviour for which would be given by the two equivalent possibilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this type of behaviour is found for example in the analysis of the mixmaster universe @xcite .",
    "a simple - minded approach would be to write @xmath20 for the first of these possibilities .",
    "this yields the particular solution @xmath21 however , bearing in mind the expansion in powers of @xmath22 found in we do well to propose @xmath23 this gives the one - parameter solution @xmath24 since is a one - parameter system , this pattern of singular behaviour ( and clearly the one corresponding to the interchange of the roles of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) does not pass the weak painlev test and so the system does not possess the weak painlev property .",
    "( in this we follow the definition of tabor @xcite[p 330 ] . )",
    "we now obtain the solution of as follows .",
    "firstly we are immediately struck by the resemblance to the coefficients in the expansion of a cubic binomial .",
    "this suggests the change of variables @xmath27 so that the system takes the form    [ 2.4 ] @xmath28    which by differentiation of the second of these and substitution for @xmath29 gives the second order equation @xmath30 equation is of a type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , p 551 ) which has been studied extensively in the literature because of the frequency of its occurrence in different areas @xcite and in particular is known , for certain values of the coefficients , to have eight symmetries instead of the obvious two of invariance under time translation and selfsimilarity , thereby making it linearisable @xcite .    for the system",
    "we obtain two possible sets of leading order behaviour .",
    "they are @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the resonances @xmath33 and @xmath34 with the resonances @xmath35 .",
    "we give the critical parts of the expansions .",
    "they are @xmath36 which gives the expansion about the singularity at @xmath37 , and @xmath38 which represents the asymptotic expansion of the solution .",
    "the second constant of integration is @xmath39 and we have followed the practice introduced by feix @xcite of making the expansion in the variable @xmath5 because of the asymptotic nature of the expansion .",
    "the expansion in has been termed @xcite a right painlev series because it is a laurent expansion about the singularity at @xmath16 in ascending powers of @xmath40 whereas that in is called a left painlev series because it is a laurent expansion in descending powers of the independent variable , @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of what is now called the left painlev series , that is an asymptotic series as a representation of the solution , has only been recognised in recent years @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the subselfsimilarity symmetry property of the system and its corresponding painlev analysis disappears under the transformation which leads to the system .",
    "the reason for this is obvious for the first of contains only two terms and a minimum of three terms is required for the presence of a subselfsimilarity symmetry @xcite ( these can be additive or multiplicative ) .",
    "it is an interesting speculation as to whether there is always a transformation which will remove the possibility of the subselfsimilar behaviour .",
    "an alternative route to the analysis of initiated by the transformation is given by the transformation @xmath41 the transformed system is now    [ 2.15a ]",
    "@xmath42    we have two possible routes for the solution of , the differentiation of ( [ 2.15a]a ) and elimination of @xmath43 or the differentiation of ( [ 2.15a]b ) and elimination of @xmath44 .",
    "the first route produces the nonlinear second order ordinary differential equation @xmath45 which belongs to the same class of equations as .",
    "if we perform the leading order analysis on , we find that the only possible singularity is a simple pole since there is no possibility of subselfsimilarity .",
    "the coefficient of the leading power can be either @xmath46 or @xmath47 . in the former case the resonances are at @xmath48 and in the latter case at @xmath49 .",
    "there is no possibility of inconsistency at the second resonance because of the rescaling symmetry .",
    "both expansions are right painlev series and the equation possesses the painlev property . if we look to the solution of by means of reduction of order , we come to an abel s equation of the second kind and firstly transformation is necessary to obtain the solution . an alternative route is to use the riccati transformation of ( with the same value of @xmath50 ) to obtain the third order equation @xmath51 which has a solution in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the second route produces the nonlinear second order ordinary differential equation @xmath52 which belongs to a class of equations to be found in kamke ( * ? ? ? * , p 574 ) . under the transformation @xmath53",
    "takes the particularly simple form @xmath54 which we shall again encounter in .",
    "the solution of is trivial and so we have @xmath55 the other solution @xmath56 follows easily from ( [ 2.15a]b ) .",
    "one easily checks that these two solutions lead to the same forms for the general solutions of the original system , .",
    "equation has just the two lie point symmetries of invariance under time translation and selfsimilarity . in marked",
    "contrast possesses eight lie point symmetries which , in a sense , makes it more like than is .",
    "we observe that the first two terms of are invariant under the homogeneity symmetry @xmath57 and so expect a more complicated pattern of leading order behaviour .",
    "this is borne out by the analysis which gives in the case of all terms dominant an exponent of @xmath58 with coefficients @xmath59 and in the subdominant case exponents of 0 and @xmath46 . in the former case",
    "the resonances are given by @xmath60 and so for this type of leading order behaviour the equation passes the painlev test and has a left painlev series , that is , an asymptotic solution .",
    "this is easily seen from if we expand it in the asymptotic form @xmath61 for the subdominant behaviour and @xmath62 the first few terms of the taylor expansion give @xmath63 we observe that the third term in , which breaks the homogeneity symmetry of the first two terms , does not affect the existence of the taylor series solution .",
    "the coefficients of the first two terms are arbitrary constants and so this is the series representation of a general solution . in the case",
    "that @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 this series representation of the solution contains the two arbitrary constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the equation satisfies the requirements of the weak painlev test .",
    "this is one occasion when all possible leading order behaviours possess the painlev property and so there is no question that the equation possesses the painlev property . for the sake of completeness , not to mention a little amusement , we perform the painlev analysis of the system . with the usual substitution for the leading order behaviour the exponents are @xmath68 so that we have the possibility of all terms being dominant with @xmath69 or of just one variable being dominant with @xmath70 . in the former case the resonances occur at @xmath60 and so we have a left painlev series . because of the symmetry of the system we shall not have inconsistencies at the resonances and we obtain the first few terms of the expansion as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the two arbitrary constants required for a general solution . for the second case the substitution of the series expansion @xmath74 results in the particular solution @xmath75 we thus arrive at the interesting conclusion that , while we started with a system , , which does not possess the ( weak ) painlev property , we can map it through the nonlinear transformation to the new system that has the strong painlev property and through the linear nonsingular transformation to the new system which , although it has the ( strong ) painlev property , naturally splits into two single equations , and , one possessing the ( strong ) painlev property and the other the weak painlev property .",
    "it so happens that has the combination of coefficients which gives eight lie point symmetries . in principle",
    "one can use these symmetries to obtain the solution , but they are particularly complicated and there is an easier route to the solution .",
    "it is known @xcite that the equations which belong to this class can be expressed as a simple third order equation by means of a riccati transformation .",
    "we put @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant to be determined to give the third order equation an optimal simplicity @xcite . using we find that becomes @xmath78 when we put @xmath79 for both of the terms containing @xmath77 then vanish .",
    "equation is trivial to solve and we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants of integration . equation ( [ 2.4]a ) is now a simple quadrature and we obtain @xmath84 for which an additive constant of integration must be set at zero to maintain consistency with ( [ 2.4]b ) .",
    "( despite the presence of the three constants @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 they provide only two independent constants of integration . )",
    "finally we obtain the solutions of the original system of equations .",
    "we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 has the same form with the opposite sign attached to the square root .",
    "we observe that in general the solutions @xmath87 and @xmath86 have branch point singularities whereas the only singularities of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are always poles .",
    "we complete our considerations of the system by looking at its first integral and invariant and some of its lie point symmetries .",
    "since the systems and ( or and ) are related by a point transformation , the discussion of one system is equivalent to the discussion of the other system when it comes to lie point symmetries and , as these underlie the existence of the first integral and invariant , of them as well .",
    "we have noted that all of the systems discussed in this paper have the two lie point symmetries which leave them invariant under the transformations of time translation and rescaling , that is @xmath90 where the summation over @xmath91 includes all of the dependent variables .",
    "the first integral is associated with @xmath92 and is simply obtained from the integration of the ratio of ( [ 2.2]a ) and ( [ 2.2]b ) , @xmath93 it is @xmath94 we use @xmath95 to obtain the invariant from the autonomous first order ordinary differential equation satisfied by the two characteristics , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which is @xmath98 the integration of is not as simple as that of since for the latter the integration is simply a quadrature whereas for the former a first order ordinary differential equation has to be solved .",
    "( this is more or less the same as the situation as the integration of a second order ordinary differential equation with the two symmetries @xcite . ) in terms of the original variables the invariant is @xmath99 in which we see that the coefficient of the independent variable , @xmath5 , is simply @xmath100 . in principle",
    "we could solve and for @xmath101 and @xmath102 as functions of @xmath5 .",
    "the lie point symmetries of the system are the equivalent of generalised symmetries at the second order level and consequently there will be an infinity of them .",
    "we have no intention of presenting them all here !",
    "we do note , however , that , if @xmath103 is a lie point symmetry of , then so also is @xmath104 .",
    "this is the equivalent result to that found in the case of second order ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "we can limit the number of symmetries found by simply making an ansatz for the functional dependence of the coefficient functions .",
    "thus , if we assume at most quadratic dependence on the variables , we obtain the three symmetries @xmath105 and , if we allow cubic dependence , the further four symmetries @xmath106 are added .",
    "we note that the power of the independent variable , @xmath5 , lags behind the powers of the dependent variables .",
    "from a casual observation of the three three - dimensional systems listed in the introduction one can not , _ a priori _ , judge which of them is the simplest . we shall presume that it is on the basis that the system contains the fewest number of terms of the three .",
    "our first step is to write the system in the simplest form by rescaling the variables @xmath107 and @xmath108 so that @xmath77 becomes unity .",
    "thus we examine the system    [ 3.1 ] @xmath109    which is a special case of the rikitake system .    because of the structure of the system there can be no subselfsimilar symmetry and",
    "the leading order behaviour is that of a simple pole . to make up for this simplicity",
    "there are four possible sets of values for the coefficients of the leading terms . if we take the leading terms to be @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the possible combinations are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath113    the resonances are determined from the solution of the characteristic equation @xmath114 they are @xmath115 .",
    "the repetition of the resonance at @xmath116 is not a cause for concern since the matrix for the determination of the resonances is a real symmetric matrix and so the geometric multiplicity of the eigen vectors equals the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalues .",
    "the expansion up to the resonance is @xmath117 and so the system possesses the ( strong ) painlev property .      differentiation of ( [ 3.1]a ) and the substitution of ( [ 3.1]b ) and ( [ 3.1]c ) , division by @xmath118 and the same process of differentiation and substitution gives the third order equation @xmath119 which , at the level of contact symmetries , only has the two symmetries relating to time translation and rescaling .",
    "the painlev analysis of reveals three patterns of leading order behaviour .",
    "the all terms dominant case has a simple pole and the resonances are @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "there is no inconsistency at the second resonance and this case passes the painlev test .",
    "subselfsimilar behaviour can be found with the first two terms which share the two homogeneity symmetries , @xmath10 and @xmath57 .",
    "the leading order terms are in @xmath122 and @xmath123 . for both",
    "we obtain a taylor series containing three arbitrary constants .",
    "consequently possesses the ( strong ) painlev property .",
    "we reduce the order of using @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the two invariants of @xmath126 , as the new independent ( @xmath101 ) and dependent ( @xmath102 ) variables to obtain the second order ordinary differential equation @xmath127 equation is a linear second order equation of very simple appearance .",
    "this indicates that has nonlocal symmetries in sufficient supply to give the necessary right point symmetries for the second order equation .",
    "equation has the solution @xmath128 and so the solution of is @xmath129 in which the integral can be evaluated in terms of elliptic integrals , the expression of which is not informative and so we omit it . because of the cyclic symmetry of @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "are given by expressions of the same form as .",
    "it is a trivial matter to obtain the two autonomous integrals of the system .",
    "they are @xmath132 the third cyclic expression is not independent of @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the determination of the necessary invariant to complete the set ( with @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) using the selfsimilar symmetry , @xmath95 , seems to be impossible .",
    "the one invariant which comes moderately easy is simply the ratio of @xmath133 and @xmath134 which is of no use .    as in the case of the two - dimensional system",
    "the system possesses an infinite number of lie point symmetries and we confine our attention to those symmetries which are up to cubic in the variables for the coefficient functions .",
    "thus we have @xmath135 we observe that the two first integrals , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , occur as coefficients in @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "although we noted the possibility of this occurrence for the system , the form of the first integral and invariant for that system was such that symmetries of that type would not be found using the ansatz we have adopted . in the case of the system the two first integrals fitted in with the ansatz and so we see the appearance of symmetries containing them as common multipliers .",
    "given the fact that we can not determine the invariant for this system , the likelihood of us making an ansatz for the structure of the symmetry which would include symmetries containing the invariant as a multiplier is most unlikely .",
    "indeed , _ a priori _ the likelihood of an ansatz producing such a multiplier would be so low that its occurrence would verge on the miraculous !",
    "a point which may be worth future consideration is whether the symmetries associated with a particular first integral have the integrals / invariants as multipliers or is there simply no ordained structure as we proposed for the system",
    "? please consider ! ) we recall that for the system we did not have @xmath138 but @xmath139 as the coefficient of @xmath140 , whereas here we have @xmath138 and @xmath141 themselves .",
    "in the variables can be rescaled to give the system    [ 6.1 ] @xmath142    where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we assume that @xmath145 . in",
    "we set the variables at @xmath146 and obtain the following sets of powers of @xmath147 @xmath148 evidently one set of dominant behaviours given by @xmath149 .",
    "the coefficients are determined from the set of equations @xmath150 and we have @xmath151 with particularly unpleasant expressions for @xmath152 and @xmath153 which we do not bother to write .",
    "there are two other sets of possible dominant behaviours given by @xmath154 there is a symmetry between these two possibilities and so we just consider one , the second .",
    "since the powers are required to be integral , @xmath155 and @xmath156 can not be negative integers as the analysis requires and so we must make a full substitution . we take @xmath157 on equating coefficients of like powers of @xmath147 to zero we",
    "obtain the following set of information @xmath158 with the rest of the coefficients following naturally .",
    "we observe that @xmath159 and @xmath160 are arbitrary and these , in combination with @xmath161 , provide the three arbitrary constants of integration required to give the general solution of .",
    "thus the subselfsimilarity dominant behaviour leads to a general solution and not a particular ( or singular , an unfortunate word in this context ) solution .",
    "it remains to look at the resonances of the all terms dominant singular behaviour .",
    "we set @xmath162 observe the following simplifications @xmath163 and obtain the characteristic equation for the resonances @xmath164 we obtain @xmath165 the first two values for the resonances are fine , but the third is almost certainly going to be a disaster except for some very specific values of the parameters @xmath166 and @xmath167 . since the third contains the difference of the two roots of the quadratic , even for `` nice '' values of @xmath168 and @xmath167 the value of @xmath169 could be terrible .",
    "we conclude that generically does not possess the painlev property and is not integrable in the sense of painlev .",
    "there is an amusing contrast with the results of the singularity analysis of the equations for the mixmaster universe . in that analysis the all terms dominant",
    "behaviour was better than the not all terms dominant behaviour @xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath170 , in ( [ 6.1]a ) and , we reduce to the following two - dimensional system @xmath171    when we make the painlev analysis of , we find that the leading order behaviour is @xmath172 the resonances occur at @xmath173 and , as one would expect from a system of such symmetry , there is no incompatibility at the second resonance .",
    "we obtain @xmath174    the lie point symmetries of up to the third order in the variables are @xmath175 with the simpler system it is possible to make the computations at least to order four in the variables , but there is little point in writing them down as most of them are of the type of @xmath176 except with more elaborate coefficients .",
    "the combination ( [ 6.1]b ) @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179([6.1]c ) gives @xmath180 which , when combined with ( [ 6.1]a ) , becomes @xmath181 we note that has only the two symmetries @xmath182    we observe that to integrate the system it is only necessary to go to a second order ordinary differential equation .",
    "equation is integrated once to give @xmath183 which immediately leads to the quadrature @xmath184 inversion of and the trivial quadrature of immediately give @xmath185 in which @xmath186^{\\ha } $ ] , @xmath187^{\\ha } $ ] , @xmath188 is another constant of integration and we have assumed that the parameters in are positive .",
    "we consider this case only as the other possibilities require a similar discussion and this would be repetitive .",
    "we are now left with the integration of ( [ 6.1]c ) which now has the simple form @xmath189 equation is a riccati equation and we transform it to a linear second order equation by means of the transformation @xmath190 to obtain @xmath191 equation can be improved in appearance by the change of variables @xmath192 we now have @xmath193 equation , being a linear second order differential equation , has eight symmetries .",
    "this knowledge is not of much use in the solution of the equation since seven of these symmetries require a knowledge of the solution .",
    "the eighth is the homogeneity symmetry , @xmath194 , which was used to obtain this equation from the riccati equation .",
    "equation is a little disturbing because it contains two constants of integration and one would prefer to discuss the solution with only the parameters , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , present .",
    "the constants of integration can be removed by dividing by @xmath195 and differentiating with respect to @xmath196 .",
    "unfortunately the resulting third order equation looks too awful to contemplate and that line of action is not pursued here . in general the solution of",
    "is in terms of the hypergeometric function which is a bit too diffuse for our purposes .",

    "if we take the value @xmath345 , we obtain a left painlev series also containing only two arbitrary constants .",
    "one of these would be a particular solution in the vicinity of the singularity and the other a particular asymptotic solution , both in the sense defined by cotsakis and leach @xcite ) .",

    "we also observe that is simply a variation on the equation we met in   2 and 3 ( and ) .",
    "the presence of the linear term does not affect the number of symmetries , which remains at eight and so implies that there exists a point transformation which linearises the equation , although it does make the transformation look more complex .    to solve we introduce the riccati transformation @xmath350 to obtain the third order linear equation of maximal symmetry , @xmath351 with solution @xmath352 so that @xmath353 which , provided @xmath354 , obviously has only poles as singularities .",
    "consequently we have a counterexample to the claim by tabor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 330 ) that the possession of the painlev property requires that all possible patterns of singular behaviour pass the painlev test .",
    "we can make a few other observations .",
    "we have noted that possesses eight lie point symmetries with or without the presence of the linear term . as in the case of and , without the linear term possesses both a left painlev series and a right painlev series .",
    "this is not the case when the linear term is present .",
    "then the only possibility is a right painlev series .",
    "this does not affect the integrability of in terms of functions with only poles as moveable singularities .",
    "the existence of the same algebra of lie point symmetries means that there exists a point transformation of which removes the linear term .",
    "that there is a change in the nature of the singularity behaviour means that this transformation can not be homeographic .",
    "naturally it must have only polelike singularities since both solutions possess the painlev property .",
    "this concludes the discussion of the fourth order system .",
    "from the analyses of the systems of equations , , , and several conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the development of the systems of equations , which in the original paper @xcite were obtained as realisations of some kinds of nonassociative algebras , considered in this paper may be viewed as a process of division of a single higher order equation . in the case of the two - dimensional quadratic system ,",
    ", one can easily imagine it as being derived from a second order equation by a standard process of reduction to a system of two first order equations .",
    "it is not surprising that there was no loss of the painlev property in this splitting . in the case of the three - dimensional first order quadratic system",
    "was derived naturally from a third order nonlinear equation .",
    "although this equation had only two contact symmetries , reduction of order brought it to a linear second order equation with eight symmetries and consequently must have seven nonlocal symmetries with nice reduction properties .",
    "it is not surprising that possesses the painlev property . in the case of the equations , and , there is a distinct change in behaviour since the parameters which are present in the equations are essential parameters and can not be removed by rescaling .",
    "the basic equation is really a nonlinear second order equation and one could imagine this being split into two first order equations followed by a further split of an arbitrary nature of one of the equations into two first order equations containing the arbitrary parameter .",
    "this situation is repeated in the case of at a higher order in that one starts from a third order nonlinear equation and obtains three first order equations which have the painlev property and which do not contain a parameter .",
    "the fourth first order equation is obtained by a parameter - dependent split of one of these three first order equations and the painlev property is lost .",
    "one can envisage a situation in which a prediction of the preservation of the painlev property can be made .",
    "given an @xmath355th order scalar ordinary differential equation possessing the painlev property , one could expect to be able to make a system of @xmath355 first order ordinary differential equations by some sort of natural reduction and the system would still possess the painlev property .",
    "any attempt to have more than @xmath355 first order equations by some sort of further splitting may inevitably lead to a loss of the painlev property .",
    "it is interesting that the second order equations possessing the painlev property , , and , which can be viewed as the origins of the systems , and , respectively are essentially the same equation and that the third order equation from which the system was derived is closely related to that equation .",
    "this does pose some interesting questions about the basis of the work of golubchik and sokolov @xcite from the point of view of the algebraic structure of scalar ordinary differential equations of the second and high orders .",
    "a third question which has only been suggested here is the question of the algebraic structure of the symmetries of the first order systems .",
    "there seems to be some structure in the symmetries listed .",
    "we note that this structure appears to be independent of the possession of the painlev property which is not surprising .",
    "algebraic properties do not require an analytic basis .",
    "thus a system can be integrable in the algebraic sense and not in the sense of painlev .",
    "however , because symmetry is at the basis of the process of reduction , a system which is integrable in the sense of painlev must also be integrable in the algebraic sense .",
    "finally we mention the interesting observation that a left painlev series can be found in subdominant behaviour .",
    "related to that is the whole question of the painlev integrability of .",
    "the solution is manifestly possessed of only poles as singularities .",
    "the equation has the painlev property for one possible variety of leading order behaviour , but not for the other .",
    "this makes one wonder just how much is required for one to conclude that there exists a solution expressible in terms of a laurent expansion about a polelike singularity .",
