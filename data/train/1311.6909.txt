    "the classical theory of bending , due to bernoulli and euler more than four centuries ago , is still considered a key simplified model for understanding the mechanics of many _ hard _ and _ soft systems_. within this theory , the mechanical properties and the shape of rods and sheets can be determined by solving an ordinary differential equation : the fundamental equation of euler s _ elastica_. several problems may be tackled by this method , albeit with some variations , as for instance the occurrence of delamination blisters @xcite , the adhesion of lipid tubules @xcite , growth mechanisms in climbing plants @xcite , the mechanics of the insertion of a guidewire into the artery of a patient @xcite , the equilibria of the uplifted heavy elastic strip @xcite and the pattern formation of flexible structures induced by tight packing @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the growth of a closed planar euler - bernoulli strip confined by a rigid _ circular _ domain .",
    "we employ a very simple growth mechanism and posit that the total length of the strip may be changed arbitrarily by a suitable external action .",
    "thus , mathematically , we consider the total length of the strip as an adjustable parameter , whose governing equation has no need to be specified .",
    "furthermore , we assume the strip to be inextensible and always at equilibrium . a simple rudimentary experimental setup can help to describe the physical phenomenon we wish to analyze .",
    "let us imagine a flexible cylinder made out of a piece of paper , simply by gluing together the edges of a rectangular sheet .",
    "next , we insert this flexible cylinder into a rigid circular tube of smaller radius . the shape of the confined sheet , unavoidably , exhibits _ blisters _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , regions of the sheet which are not in contact with the substrate but form inward protuberances . even in the presence of an ideal frictionless substrate ,",
    "part of the strip adheres to the confining wall as the circular geometry acts as an adhesion mechanism .",
    "an increase of adhesion may be further promoted by capillarity .",
    "generally , adhesion by capillarity may occur in an elastic structure when its restoring ability is unable fully to overcome the interfacial attraction induced by liquid surface tensions .",
    "various capillary adhesion phenomena can be observed at small scale in both natural phenomena and industrial processes . for a more exhaustive overview of these topics ,",
    "we refer the reader to the recent review article @xcite and references therein .",
    "the problem of a growing elastica confined by a frictionless rigid circumference has been studied numerically in @xcite in order to explain the packing of a flexible sheet inside a cylindrical cavity .",
    "this analysis has been subsequently extended to the growth of an helfrich s membrane confined within a spherical domain @xcite .",
    "in addition to the elastic problem , both these papers consider the complicated conditions arising from the contact with the container and from the self - contact .",
    "other studies exploit the theory of elliptic integrals to characterize the adhesion of lipid tubules on curved substrates @xcite , the stability of clamped elastic arches @xcite or the euler buckling of constrained strait beams @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , the elastica theory has been used to study the deformation of thin elastic sheets that adhere to a stiff flat substrate by means of a surface potential .",
    "the authors use a combination of numerical and asymptotic techniques to predict the equilibrium shapes of this _",
    "sticky elastica_.    our paper generalizes the theoretical results relative to the formation of delamination blisters on a flat surface , as reported by wagner and vella @xcite , to the case of a circular substrate . in  2 , we obtain the equilibrium equations as extremal points of the energy functional subject to suitable constraints .",
    "the variational procedure is here slightly complicated by the fact that the end - points of the energy functional are not fixed , but are part of the unknowns .",
    "this entails that , besides the equilibrium equation and its boundary conditions , a further boundary condition is needed to determine the location of the detachment points .",
    "in contrast to the case of a flat substrate , the morphology of the strip is affected not only by the _ elastocapillarity length _ , but also by the container radius . in  3 ,",
    "the symmetrical equilibrium configurations of the strip are investigated using both an integral formulation and an asymptotic approach .",
    "relevant measurable quantities ( the blister height , the length of the adherent part and the internal forces ) are provided as functions of the total length and the adherence strength .",
    "furthermore , we provide an asymptotic expansion of the solution in terms of a dimensionless parameter measuring the excess length of the beam with respect to the container length .",
    "finally , in  4 , we analyze the case of adherence due to the sole curvature when the delimiting wall is a frictionless unilateral contact . in this case , the tensional state of the entire strip and the forces exerted on the wall can be easily computed .",
    "as we shall see , these forces show a singular behaviour and thus lead to non - trivial conclusions .",
    "in this section we derive the equilibrium equation and the boundary conditions that have to be fulfilled by the free part of the euler - bernoulli beam .",
    "let us describe the geometry of the beam with a planar curve @xmath0 . in the plane of the curve",
    ", we introduce a cartesian frame of reference @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the origin and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the unit vectors along , respectively , the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 axes .",
    "let @xmath7 be the arc - length along the curve and @xmath8 the inflection angle .",
    "more precisely , @xmath8 measures the anti - clockwise angle between @xmath3 and the tangent to the curve @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the frenet curvature is @xmath10 , where the subscript denotes differentiation with respect to its argument .",
    "each point @xmath11 on @xmath0 can be parametrized by the cartesian coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that its position vector is @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath15 , it follows that @xmath16 furthermore , we posit the following classical bending energy @xmath17 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\int_{-\\frac{\\ell}{2}}^{\\frac{\\ell}{2 } } ( \\theta_s - c_0)^2 \\d s,\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath18 accounts for a possible spontaneous curvature of the beam , @xmath19 is the bending rigidity and @xmath20 is the total length .    .",
    "we assume that its shape has a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath6-axis , allowing the study only for the branch @xmath21 . the free part of the curve is parametrized by values of the arc length in the range @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the detachment point . at @xmath24",
    "the curvature vanishes .",
    "the adopted conventions imply that the curvature is positive in @xmath25 and negative in @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 throughout the adherent part.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is worth noticing that the parametrization of @xmath0 by means of the inflection angle @xmath28 automatically ensures the arc - length preservation , thus no lagrange multiplier associated to the inextensibility constraint is needed .    with reference to the schematic representation in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", we assume that the beam forms a unique blister .",
    "thus , the beam at equilibrium consists of two parts : a free non - adherent curve , described by @xmath29 , and an adherent one , with @xmath7 in the range @xmath30 \\cup [ \\bs , \\ell/2]$ ] .",
    "hereinafter , we assume @xmath8 odd , so that the problem can be studied in the interval @xmath31 $ ] only .",
    "in our simplified treatment there are only two detachment points , which correspond to the arc - lengths @xmath32 and @xmath23 , respectively and , of course , are constrained to lie along a circumference of radius @xmath33 .",
    "a glance at figure [ fig1 ] shows that their distance is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the value of the inflection angle at @xmath23 ( note that @xmath36 , by our conventions ) .",
    "elementary geometric arguments yield also the following identity @xmath37 on the other hand , the distance between the detachment points can be obtained by integrating @xmath38 in @xmath39 $ ] . as a consequence , the equilibrium solution should obey the global constraint @xmath40 thus , in the free region , the effective potential to minimize becomes @xmath41 = \\int_{0}^{\\bs } \\kappa(\\theta_s - c_0)^2 \\d s - 2t_x \\left(r \\sin\\bt + \\int_{0}^{\\bs } \\cos \\theta \\,\\d s \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a lagrange multiplier and @xmath23 is to be determined in the minimization process .    in the adherent region ,",
    "the beam is in contact with the circular container and the bending energy is constant since @xmath43 .",
    "however , in order to account for elasto - capillarity effects , we further consider an adhesive potential describing the strip - substrate adhesion .",
    "we assume this in its simplest form taking it proportional to the length of the sticking region through a positive constant @xmath44 , which is called the _ adherence strength_. the energy associated to the adherent part is therefore @xmath45 = \\int_{\\bs}^{\\frac{\\ell}{2 } } \\kappa\\left(\\frac{1}{r } + c_0\\right)^2 \\d s -2 \\int_{\\bs } ^{\\frac{\\ell}{2 } } w \\,\\d s.\\ ] ] since the shape of the adherent part is fixed , this energy is a function of @xmath23 only .",
    "the equilibrium configurations are stationary points of the total free energy @xmath46 . by adopting the notation as in @xcite",
    ", we consider two neighboring curves @xmath8 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 the variational procedure must explicitly include the fact that the end points @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fixed , while the detachment point @xmath51 is not . consequently , standard arguments @xcite show that the possible variations have to satisfy the following equations at the end - points and to first order    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",

    "\\label{var2}\\ ] ] the equilibrium condition , @xmath62 , for any arbitrary choice of @xmath63 and @xmath59 , leads to the requirement that each term enclosed in square brackets in must vanish . therefore ,",
    "once the explicit expressions of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 as given in are taken into account , the following euler - lagrange equation is derived @xmath67 with the boundary conditions @xmath68 as expected , the angle @xmath8 has to satisfy the non - linear pendulum equation .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to the classic pendulum dynamics , the equation has to be solved with boundary conditions rather than initial conditions .",
    "moreover , both the lagrangian multiplier @xmath69 ( which plays the role of gravity in the pendulum analogy ) and the boundary point @xmath23 are unknowns .",
    "however , the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath59 in gives a further condition at the detachment point : @xmath70 which we refer to as the _ transversality condition_. this equation , along with eqs .",
    ", and , allows us to solve the problem and thus determine the unknowns @xmath42 and @xmath23 .",
    "the condition is a special case of a more general _ adhesive condition _ obtained in @xcite .",
    "it reflects the fact that there are two different sources of adhesion : ( i ) the adherence by curvature , which is proportional to the bending stiffness and is a decreasing function of the radius @xmath33 ; and ( ii ) the adhesive potential whose strength is provided by @xmath44 . in the limit case where @xmath71 , equation guarantees the continuity of the curvature @xmath72 at @xmath51 . on the other hand , whenever the substrate is flat ( @xmath73 ) , we correctly recover the adherence condition used in @xcite .    by defining the _ elasto - capillarity _ as @xmath74 ,",
    "reduces to @xmath75 where the minus sign in front of @xmath76 is due to the fact that the curvature radius at the detachment point can not exceed that of the delimiting wall .",
    "finally , we remark that the spontaneous curvature @xmath18 plays no role in the equilibrium equations . indeed ,",
    "the energetic terms involving @xmath18 are null lagrangians and , hence , they could possibly affect only the boundary conditions .",
    "however , since @xmath0 is a closed curve , @xmath18 can not have any effect on the equilibrium shape .",
    "we now examine a special class of equilibrium solutions , schematically shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "however , we have assumed that @xmath8 is odd ( and therefore also @xmath186 is odd ) .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath183 must vanish and the torque equation reduces to . as a further consequence of this symmetry ,",
    "we observe explicitly that from @xmath187 it also follows that the constant internal stress , @xmath179 , is purely horizontal : @xmath188 .     and",
    "@xmath189 , as given in equations and respectively , are negative , so that the beam is under compression for any admissible configuration .",
    "the concentrated force @xmath190 is necessary to balance the vertical components of the internal forces at @xmath51.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]     + when the beam is in contact with the external container , the balance of forces requires the introduction of the contact forces , whose density per unit length will be denoted by @xmath191 .",
    "since we model the container as an ideal unilateral frictionless constraint , @xmath192 is directed along the inward normal to the surface , hence , we assume @xmath193 , with @xmath194 , where @xmath195 .",
    "furthermore , the curvature of the beam in contact with the container is constant and eq .",
    "implies that also the internal moment @xmath196 is constant .",
    "thus , from @xmath181 , we obtain that the normal component of the internal force , @xmath197 , must vanish for @xmath198 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "equation @xmath38 , projected along @xmath199 and @xmath200 , gives @xmath201 where @xmath189 is the axial component of @xmath179 .",
    "this also implies that necessarily @xmath202 . + more subtle is the discussion of the balances at detachment point . to put the problem in the right perspective ,",
    "we isolate a small portion of beam around the detachment point . since the internal force in the adherent part posses a non - zero vertical component , while @xmath187 in the free part , the balance of forces requires the introduction of a concentrate reactive force @xmath203 .",
    "this can only be given by the container , and therefore it is necessarily direct as the inward normal @xmath204 .",
    "more precisely , the balance in the @xmath6-direction is @xmath205 thus , @xmath206 is non - negative ( and the contact is truly unilateral ) only for @xmath207 $ ] . on the other hand , the continuity of the axial internal force yields @xmath208 whence @xmath209 the restriction @xmath207 $ ] implies that @xmath42 is non - positive , in agreement with the fact that the entire beam is under compression",
    ". finally we remark that ( when @xmath71 ) the transversality condition implies the continuity of the curvature at @xmath23 and , thus , the continuity of the internal torque .",
    "+ it is now of special interest to study the asymptotic behaviour of the reactive forces @xmath210 and @xmath206 .",
    "equations , and yield @xmath211 and @xmath212 . recalling that @xmath213",
    ", we gather that both @xmath210 and @xmath206 diverge as @xmath109 goes to zero , because @xmath214 diverges . in fact , by using together with the asymptotic expansions and , to leading order we find @xmath215 albeit unexpected , this result is in agreement with the experimental results reported in @xcite , where it is shown that the mean pressure exerted by the strip on the container becomes very large when @xmath109 tends to zero .",
    "we have studied the morphology of an elastic closed inextensible strip of length @xmath20 , confined by a cylinder of radius @xmath33 , where @xmath216 .",
    "the excess length forces the beam to detach from the cylinder , leading to two distinct parts : an adhering portion and a free part ( or ` blister ' ) .",
    "these regions are governed by different equations and must agree at the detachment point , whose position is part of the problem .",
    "two different mechanisms concur to promote the adhesion .",
    "the first is purely geometric and is the curvature of the container .",
    "the second has a physical origin and it is given by the elasto - capillarity interaction of the strip with the container . at human length",
    "scales the former usually dominates .",
    "however , at small scales the elasto - capillarity often plays a significant role in many phenomena @xcite .",
    "we have presented numerical results for the equilibrium shape when the strip length @xmath20 and the adhesion strength are given , allowing for the possibility of large deformations . at fixed @xmath20 ,",
    "the solution depends upon a dimensionless parameter @xmath217 that measures the relevance of the adhesion due to the curvature with respect to that due to the adhesive potential .",
    "the geometrical aspects dominate whenever @xmath105 approaches one . on the contrary , for very large @xmath105 , while the elasto - capillarity length remains finite , we match the results that apply to the formation of delamination blisters on a rigid flat substrate @xcite .",
    "in addition to the numerical results , we have provided the asymptotic expansions for two quantities related to the blister shape : the length of the adhering region @xmath108 and the blister height @xmath113 .",
    "the small parameter used in these expansions is the normalized excess length @xmath218 .",
    "the two - term approximation is able to capture the behaviour of @xmath108 up to the points of self - contact or contact of the blister with the delimiting wall .",
    "by contrast , the same approximation predicts the blister height accurately only in a smaller range of @xmath109 . in any case , the asymptotic analysis yields simple laws that an experimentalist can possibly use to determine some constitutive parameters by inverse analysis .",
    "finally , we have considered the case where the delimiting wall is modelled as an ideal frictionless unilateral contact and hence determined the external actions that the surface exerts on the strip .",
    "these consist in a distributed force ( per unit length ) and , unexpectedly , also in concentrated force acting at the detachment point .",
    "the latter makes the derivative of the curvature discontinuous at the detachment point and is also responsible for the discontinuity of the internal shear force .",
    "we also find that when the detachment angle , @xmath35 , reaches @xmath219 , the contact force exerted by the container changes sign , thus violating the unilateral constraint .",
    "this effect places an upper limit to the value of admissible @xmath109 .",
    "more precisely , we find that this effect appears for @xmath220 , a value below that attained for the blister contact with the container . furthermore",
    ", our asymptotic analysis has shown that the internal force and , consequently , the external actions diverge when @xmath109 tends to zero .",
    "this agrees with the experimental results reported in @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", the origin of this singularity could be a consequence of the assumed inextensibility . in a more realistic model",
    ", one should relax the inextensibility constraint in favor of a penalization energy term related to compression / dilatation .",
    "thus , initially the strip may undergo a slight compression and then form a blister , beyond a compression threshold .",
