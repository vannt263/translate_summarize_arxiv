    "the phenomenology of hadrons containing a single heavy quark is greatly simplified by the fact that nonperturbative hadronic physics can be parameterized by an expansion in @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the heavy quark . at lowest order ,",

    "inclusive decays of heavy hadrons involving large momentum transfer to the decay products can also be treated in hqet with the help of the operator product expansion ( ope)@xcite . at leading order the parton model results are recovered , and nonperturbative corrections are parameterized by matrix elements of higher dimensional operators , suppressed by powers of @xmath7 .",
    "decays of heavy hadrons to light hadrons can not be treated exclusively with hqet unless the four - momentum of the light degrees of freedom are small compared to @xmath6 . however , in regions of phase space where the light hadronic decay products have large energy @xmath8 , a different expansion in powers of @xmath9 can be performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite dugan and grinstein used this approach to construct the large energy effective theory ( leet ) , which describes the interaction of very energetic quarks with soft gluons .",
    "however , leet is missing an important degree of freedom , namely collinear gluons , and does not reproduce the ir physics of qcd  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that an effective theory including both collinear and soft gluons correctly reproduces the infrared physics of qcd at one loop .",
    "this collinear - soft theory is needed between the scale @xmath10 and an intermediate scale , below which collinear modes can be integrated out . for inclusive decays",
    "it was shown that the collinear - soft theory can be matched at the intermediate scale onto a theory containing only soft degrees of freedom .",
    "the power counting in the collinear - soft theory is complicated by the presence of two low energy scales , which must be properly accounted for .",
    "these scales can be clearly seen by considering the momentum of a collinear quark . if the quark moves along the light cone direction @xmath11 with momentum @xmath12 then @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a small parameter .",

    "there are , however , advantages to using an effective field theory approach over the method of regions ; namely it is straightforward to systematically include power corrections , and it is possible to properly account for operator running , which sums sudakov logarithms . in order to consistently go beyond leading order it is important to give a detailed construction of the effective field theory .",
    "this was not done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is one of the main points of this paper .    the collinear - soft effective theory can be used to describe both inclusive and exclusive heavy - to - light decays . for inclusive decays",

    "it is also possible to apply the collinear - soft effective theory to exclusive heavy - to - light decays .",
    "the form factors for such transitions have contributions from the exchange of soft gluons with spectators ( soft contributions ) , as well as from the exchange of collinear gluons ( so called hard contributions ) . in this paper",
    "we will only consider the soft form factors , even though the two types of contributions are believed to be the same order in @xmath21  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite relations among the soft form factors were derived , and it was shown that only three independent functions are needed to describe heavy - to - light decays .",
    "however , these relations were obtained within the framework of leet , which does not include collinear gluons . in this paper",
    "we show that the inclusion of collinear modes does not alter the soft form factor relations to leading order in @xmath14 .",
    "since the collinear - soft effective theory reproduces the infrared physics of qcd at large energies , this establishes these soft form factor relations in the large energy limit of qcd .    in this paper",

    "next we show that in the collinear - soft theory only three independent soft form factors describe exclusive heavy to light decays , establishing these form factor relations in the large energy limit of qcd .",
    "the one loop matching onto currents in the effective theory allows us to calculate the perturbative corrections to these form factor relations in an infrared safe manner .",
