    "one of the primary mysteries of high energy physics is the large difference between scale of the electroweak and fundamental scale of gravity which is known as the hierarchy problem .",
    "one way to solve the hierarchy problem was proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) in 1999 @xcite . in this model",
    ", gravity can propagate in 5-dimensional non - factorizable geometry and therefore it generates the 4-dimensional weak planck scale hierarchy by an exponential function of the compactification radius which is called warped factor . in this scenario ,",
    "an infinite tower of the kk excited particles appears which their effective couplings with other particles are characterized by an exponential warped factor . while in the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) model for extra dimension @xcite , the mass difference of each kk excited",
    "particle is inversely proportional to the radius of the extra dimensions and it is more difficult to detect and identify the kk excited particles at the lhc . as a consequence ,",
    "the rs model is more motivated than the add model @xcite .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle which have been discovered to date and might be the first place in which the new physics effects could appear .",
    "the lhc allows us to investigate the properties of the top quark in details .",
    "very large numbers of top quarks are produced at the lhc eventually more than @xmath5 @xmath6 pairs per year @xcite .",
    "this will make feasible the precise investigations of the top interactions . at the lhc , top quarks",
    "are dominantly produced in @xmath6 pairs via the processes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an intriguing speciality of the top quark is its extremely short lifetime which is due to its heaviness .",
    "this feature causes that it decays before it can form any hadronic bound state . as a result",
    ", the top quark spin will be transferred to its decay products .",
    "the cross section value for top pair production have been measured by cms experiment recently @xcite : @xmath9~(\\rm stat\\oplus sys).\\label{exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper , we study the effects of rs model on the @xmath6 production at the lhc and compare our numerical results with the experimental measurement . to study the effects of rs model , we consider three quantities which are particularly useful for comparing theory with experimental results .",
    "these quantities are the total cross section of top pair production , the differential cross section as a function of invariant mass of @xmath4 , and the spin asymmetry in top - antitop production .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we summarize the effects of rs model on the cross section production of top - antitop and spin asymmetry . in section  3",
    "we compare the effects of the rs model with the lhc measurements and present our numerical results . in section 3 , we also discuss the constraints on the parameters space of rs model using the future measurements of spin asymmetry .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the model and study the effects of kk excited gravitons on top - antitop production at the lhc .",
    "the set up of rs model consists of two d3-branes which embedded in a five dimensional bulk spacetime @xcite .",
    "this theory has been considered a 5-dimensional non - factorizable metric @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the coordinates for the familiar four dimensions , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the coordinate for an extra dimension and @xmath14 is a compactification radius .",
    "two branes are localized at @xmath15 and @xmath16 which are called hidden and visible branes , respectively . here",
    "@xmath17 is the @xmath18 curvature scale which is of order the planck scale .",
    "effective lagrangian in 4-dimensional effective theory is given by @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the known planck scale , @xmath21 is the symmetric energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields on the visible brane and @xmath22 are graviton fields . after expanding the graviton field into the kk states , lagrangian is found as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "examining of the rs action in the 4-d effective theory yields the relation : @xmath25 to solve the hierarchy problem , it is assumed that gravity is localized on the brane at @xmath15 and @xmath26 @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "@xmath27 scale theory can naturally be attained on the 3-brane at @xmath28 .",
    "the scale of physical processes on this @xmath27-brane is then @xmath29 . according to eq .",
    "[ inter ] , the graviton zero - mode couples to the sm fields with usual strength while the kk modes strongly couples to the sm fields with the suppression factor of @xmath30 .",
    "the masses of the kk excitations of graviton are given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a root of the bessel function of the first order .",
    "in this paper , we study the effect of exchanged kk excited gravitons on the @xmath4 production cross section .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) processes for the production of top pair at the lhc include these two processes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding invariant matrix elements for these processes including the kk graviton modes effects have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath33 is the initial state , the amplitude for the same spin direction of top - antitop and opposite spin direction are given by : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the top quark mass . here",
    "@xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is partonic centre - of - mass energy and @xmath41 is the total decay width of the @xmath42-th kk graviton excitation @xcite . in this paper",

    "the effects of kk excitations on observables are negligible . in eq .",
    "[ amp1 ] , @xmath45 is the angle between the incoming and outgoing top quark , @xmath46 is the strong coupling constant .",

    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the parton momentum fractions and @xmath59 is the factorization scale .",
    "in the previous section , we introduced the total cross section of top pair production at the lhc . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the differential cross section and spin asymmetry and compare them with the ongoing measurement at the lhc .",
    "we are also interested in the differential cross section as a function of invariant mass @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the four - momenta of top and anti - top , respectively .",
    "this quantity is defined by    @xmath63    the best way to study the top pair spin correlation is to analyze the angular correlations of two charged leptons originating from the full leptonic top - antitop decay .",
    "spin asymmetry between the top - antitop pair is defined as @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the production cross section for top pair with characterized spin indices . in the context of sm ,",
    "spin asymmetry has been calculated at @xmath66 center - of - mass energy to be @xmath67 for the lhc while it is @xmath68 for @xmath69 . the cms collaboration hopes to measure spin asymmetry of this process by several percent @xcite .    in the rest of this section , we study the effects of kk excitation of gravitons on the production cross section of @xmath70 at the lhc .",
    "we first discuss the bounds on parameters space of the rs model then we present our results and discuss the possibility of restricting the rs model parameters at the lhc via top pair production observables .    in the rs model ,",
    "there are two main parameters which are the first excitation graviton mass ( @xmath3 ) and the coupling parameter ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "there are two kinds of experimental constraints on the parameters of rs model .",
    "first kind of constraints arises from indirect searches for the large extra dimensions .",

    "rs gravitons decaying to pairs of photons have been studied and shown that for values of the coupling parameter ( @xmath0 ) ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 , at @xmath73 confidence level , the lower bounds on excited graviton masses vary from than 371 to @xmath74 .",
