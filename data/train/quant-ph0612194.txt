    "unlike ordinary phase transitions , quantum phase transitions ( qpts )  @xcite take place at a temperature of absolute zero and are consequently driven entirely by quantum fluctuations , rather than thermal ones .",
    "moreover , the long - range , algebraically decaying correlations which are characteristic of critical many - body ground states are due entirely to entanglement . as such , one would expect entanglement measures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) to provide further insight into the fundamental physical underpinnings of qpts , possibly complementing the conventional condensed - matter approach , which relies mostly on two - point correlation functions .",
    "indeed , osterloh and co - workers  @xcite demonstrated singular and scaling behaviour of a bipartite entanglement measure in the vicinity of the critical point in the one - dimensional xy spin model . on the other hand , this behaviour could be understood entirely from that of the relevant two - point correlation functions as these are sufficient to determine the two - particle reduced density matrices .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement between just two sites is not particularly well suited to capturing the large - scale behaviour of correlations , which becomes all the more relevant in the critical regime .",
    "this was recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the scaling behaviour of the entanglement between a contiguous _ block _ of @xmath1 sites with the rest of the lattice was first considered in lattice field theories .",
    "it was found that the entanglement entropy of _ noncritical _ chains with short - ranged interactions reaches a saturation level , while the entanglement entropy diverges logarithmically with @xmath1 in the field limit , i.e. in the case of _ critical _ chains .",
    "this approach was subsequently pursued numerically  @xcite in the particular context of the one - dimensional xy model and , in more generality , in an analytical treatment based on random matrix theory  @xcite , applicable to any spin chain hamiltonian that can be cast into a quadratic form of fermionic operators .    at the same time",
    ", progress has been hampered by the realization that _ bi - partite _ entanglement , whether of blocks of spins or otherwise , at best only gives us an incomplete , local picture of the entanglement exhibited by generic many - body ground states .",
    "it is something of a truism , of course , to note that a truly global , multi - partite approach is indispensable if one wishes to capture the entanglement that pervades critical many - body ground states simultaneously at all length scales ( for recent work on multi - partite entanglement in quantum spin chains see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    unfortunately , the theory of multi - partite entanglement is still very much in its infancy .",
    "it is true that many of the entanglement measures used for bi - partite states carry straightforward generalizations to the multi - partite setting .",
    "this is particularly true for distance - based entanglement measures , such as the relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite or the closely related geometric entanglement  @xcite : the entanglement of a state is then simply quantified in terms of the minimum distance of that state from the set of all multi - partite separable states , rather than the set of all bi - partite separable states . however , it is one thing to generalize the axiomatic definitions of entanglement measures to include the multi - partite case , but quite another to still be able to compute these in practice .",
    "moreover , the theory of multi - partite entanglement is still plagued by a host of different candidates for suitable entanglement measures , even for the case of pure states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    in view of these difficulties ,",
    "attention has shifted to include other , potentially related , means of characterizing qpts  @xcite .",
    "one such approach centres around the notion of _ geometric phase _",
    "@xcite , and it is this approach which we wish to pursue in the remainder of this work .      in his seminal paper",
    "@xcite , berry investigated the phase picked up by an eigenstate of a parameter - dependent hamiltonian when transported adiabatically around a closed trajectory in parameter space .",
    "it turns out that in addition to the well - known dynamical phase there is also a geometric component to the phase , which is observable , at least in principle . while the dynamical phase provides a measure of the duration of the hamiltonian s evolution and is independent of the geometry of the trajectory followed , conversely , the geometric phase is independent of the rate at which the state is transported around the loop ( as long as this is slow enough for the adiabatic theorem to rule out transitions to neighbouring , orthogonal states ) and depends solely upon the geometry of the trajectory .",
    "the geometric phase had hitherto been widely overlooked as just another unphysical phase factor , and certainly had not been granted the level of recognition it enjoys nowadays .",
    "before going on to explain how berry s phase may be used to probe for qpts , it is useful here to first restate a simple example given in berry s original paper , which serves to illustrate the concept of geometric phase . to that end , consider a single spin-@xmath2 particle which is coupled to an external magnetic field , and suppose the spin is initially aligned with the magnetic field , i.e. the particle is in an eigenstate of the system s hamiltonian .",
    "then the spin will remain aligned with the magnetic field vector ( the particle remains in the instantaneous eigenstate ) when the magnetic field vector is made to rotate adiabatically . upon completion of some closed trajectory ,",
    "the final state of the particle differs from its initial one by an overall phase factor , which is part dynamical , part geometric in origin .",
    "now , it turns out that the geometric phase is in fact equal in size to precisely half the solid angle subtended at the origin by the magnetic field vector s trajectory in parameter space .",
    "this result not only serves to highlight in a particularly acute way the geometric character of berry s phase , but it also gives an indication of the origin of berry s phase : the spin s state is degenerate when the magnetic field is switched off , and the geometric phase can thus be interpreted as providing a measure of the view of the circuit as seen from that point of degeneracy at the origin of the parameter space .",
    "in fact , in any general setting , the emergence of geometric phases can always be traced back to the presence of isolated singularities in parameter space .",
    "formally , berry s phase can be related to the curvature of the hilbert space bundle over the base space of parameters  @xcite , and it is this interpretation of berry s phase which renders its potential usefulness as a diagnostic tool for criticality plausible : points of degeneracy are associated with a greater curvature of the associated hilbert space bundle , and therefore it might be reasonable to expect berry s phase to act as a signature for quantum critical points in interacting spin systems .",
    "of course , the geometric phase of @xmath3 non - interacting spin-@xmath2 particles with respect to a particular circuit is simply @xmath3 times the geometric phase of a single particle , which in turn can be related to the circuit s solid angle , as explained above .",
    "however , as we switch on the spin - spin interactions , this simple interpretation of the geometric phase in terms of solid angles starts to break down .",
    "it is of great interest to know how the geometric phase of a set of interacting spins with respect to a given circuit changes as a function of the coupling parameter , and whether the geometric phase is able to signal the presence of critical points in the system .",
    "an important point to note here is that the circuit in parameter space need only pass _ near _ the critical point for the berry phase to register it . in other words ,",
    "the system need not actually undergo the quantum phase transition for the berry phase to pinpoint its presence and location in parameter space , a consideration which assumes particular importance in the light of the difficulties that may be associated with physically implementing actual qpts .",
    "a relationship between the geometric phase and criticality in spin chains was examined by carollo and pachos  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the authors analyzed the berry phase of the ground state of a one - dimensional spin-@xmath2 @xmath4 model @xmath5 where @xmath6 for an odd number of spins @xmath3 .",
    "the berry phase , as computed with respect to a rotation of the complete hamiltonian around the @xmath7-axis , was shown to exhibit the following property in the thermodynamical limit @xmath8 : @xmath9 as the @xmath4 model is critical for @xmath10 ( and non - critical otherwise ) , the quantity given above may be interpreted as a signature of criticality for this model . unfortunately , the berry phase _ per spin _ ,",
    "@xmath11 , is not a physical quantity that is accessible via experiments .",
    "we can only measure the _ total _ berry phase @xmath12 , which vanishes for all values of @xmath13 : i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "this is in agreement with hamma  @xcite , who also showed , via a different line of argument , that for a finite number of spins , the berry phase acquired by the ground state is always trivial ( @xmath15 or @xmath0 ) . as an alternative",
    ", it was suggested that the same quantity would be non - trivial in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath16 .",
    "however , for any physical , finite system , no matter how large , one is not able to detect criticality in this manner .",
    "in other words , any finite - size scaling behaviour is completely lacking , i.e. @xmath17 ; it is only in the thermodynamic limit itself that this method represents a signature of criticality , i.e. the limiting case is reached discontinuously . as such , the result s worth is perhaps more of an abstract , mathematical nature , than of any real , physically measurable consequence .    in the present work , in contrast",
    ", we employ a technique based on the geometric phase that is able to detect critical points without the need to contract the circuit s radius to zero or to extend the number of particles to infinity .",
    "we do so by considering discretized circuits that pass directly through the critical point , rather than circumnavigating it .",
    "this procedure and the obtained results are outlined in the following .",
    "we start by introducing the concept of a bargmann invariant  @xcite and its associated phase , which may be regarded as a generalized berry phase .",
    "it will be seen that bargmann invariants are ideally suited for _ numerically _ analyzing the gauge - invariant phase induced by evolving states along a _",
    "discretized _ circuit in parameter space .",
    "we then introduce the model of interacting spin-@xmath2 particles with which we will be concerned for the rest of this paper and discuss some of its more salient features .",
    "the bargmann invariant and associated phase is computed numerically for a chosen discretized circuit and plotted as a function of the spin coupling strength @xmath18 . of note",
    "will be the ` speed ' ( to be defined ) with which the bargmann invariant changes as a function of @xmath18 and the behaviour of the magnitude of the bargmann invariant ; we will find that both of these quantities can act as adequate signatures of criticality . at this stage",
    ", it may be helpful to depict the procedure schematically :    [ fig : schematic ] [ tc][tc]@xmath18 [ tc][tc]@xmath19 [ bl][bl]@xmath20 [ rc][rc]@xmath21 [ rc][rc]@xmath22    let us fix the coupling parameter to some value @xmath23 and choose a particular circuit composed of @xmath24 vertices @xmath25 , each representing the set of parameters needed ( together with @xmath23 ) in order to completely describe the hamiltonian of the system at that point . at each individual point on the circuit",
    "we numerically compute the ground state of the system .",
    "the bargmann invariant associated with the circuit at @xmath23 is then obtained by cyclically multiplying successive overlaps of these ground state wavefunctions .",
    "this will be explained in more detail in section  [ section : bargmann ] , which is devoted entirely to the subject of bargmann invariants ; for now , we merely note that , in order to be sure to acquire a gauge - invariant quantity in this way , the wavefunctions at the start and end points of the circle need to be taken as _ identical_. by repeating this procedure for a range of different coupling strengths ( generating a complex number , the bargmann invariant , for each value ) , we start to build up a picture of the general trend .",
    "we present our results for varying lengths of the spin chain , contrast the case of spin-@xmath2 particles with that of spin-@xmath26 particles , and discuss the effect of increasing the number @xmath24 of constituent vertices of the circuit",
    ". of particular interest , of course , is what , if anything , may be said about the bargmann invariant as the coupling parameter crosses its critical point @xmath19 . the report concludes with a summary and brief discussion of our work .",
    "in quite general terms one may define the phase difference @xmath27 between two non - orthogonal state vectors , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , by the relation @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "naturally , individual state vectors are only defined up to arbitrary phase factors ; @xmath27 is thus gauge - dependent and its value may not be assigned any direct physical meaning . on the other hand ,",
    "any _ cyclic _ combination of state vectors , such as @xmath32 is manifestly gauge - invariant and may therefore potentially represent a physically relevant , measurable quantity .",
    "this observation features strongly in the early works of pancharatnam  @xcite and it also appears in the form of a remark in the celebrated proof of wigner s theorem by bargmann  @xcite .",
    "introducing some notation , we define the _ bargmann invariant _ with respect to a general @xmath24-vertex circuit in parameter space by @xmath33 the associated _ bargmann phase _ is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "modulo @xmath0 , the global bargmann phase is just the sum of the individual phases , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "note that we require @xmath36 for non - trivial bargmann phases .",
    "suppose now , for argument s sake , that we are dealing with state vectors @xmath37 that represent the instantaneous ground states of a family of parameter - dependent hamiltonians @xmath38 .",
    "then , in the continuum limit where the sum above is replaced by a contour integral over an infinitesimal phase along a ( smooth ) closed circuit in parameter space , the bargmann invariant reduces to the usual berry phase . in this sense",
    "bargmann invariants may be regarded as generalized berry phases .",
    "the key advantage afforded by the generalized formulation lies in its computational ease : bargmann invariants lend themselves directly to numerical computation , and thus , crucially , to scenarios where parts of the circuit under consideration represent non - integrable hamiltonians , as is the case in the present work .",
    "an obvious potential drawback is that the discretization procedure may lack the simple interpretational underpinnings of the berry phase in terms of physical adiabatic processes .",
    "consider a spin chain with nearest - neighbour @xmath39 interactions in the presence of an external magnetic field , which is aligned along an arbitrary direction @xmath40 .",
    "the system is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath41 where , @xmath42 denotes a vector of unit length , so that @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 . note that we impose periodic boundary conditions , so that @xmath46 .",
    "as already outlined in the previous two sections , our aim is now to analyze the bargmann invariant induced by the ground states of a family of hamiltonians ( [ eq : generalham ] ) that is characterized by a set of @xmath24 unit vectors @xmath47 .",
    "typically , we will imagine the magnetic field vectors of that family of hamiltonians to be arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon residing on the surface of the bloch sphere ( i.e. @xmath48 ) ; an example of such a circuit is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch2 ] . for a given coupling strength , @xmath23 , the bargmann invariant can now be obtained by numerically computing the ground states at each of the circuit s vertices and applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasedefn2 ] ) . having chosen our circuit in parameter space , we would then like to investigate the manner in which the bargmann invariant depends on the choice of spin coupling strength , @xmath18 .",
    "of particular interest are circuits that slice through any critical points of the system .",
    "does the bargmann invariant undergo a marked shift when the parameters pass through their critical values ?",
    "of further interest is the dependence on the number @xmath24 of vertices of the regular polygon circuit , as well as the dependence on the number @xmath3 of spins in the chain .    leaving the choice of circuit in parameter space open for now , it is evident from the form of hamiltonian ( [ eq : generalham ] ) that there are two ` special ' directions in which the magnetic field vector may point , namely the @xmath49-direction and any direction in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "the former is essentially a classical model while the latter corresponds to the quantum ising model . in both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian is analytically soluble .",
    "of course , it is well known that the ising model exhibits criticality when @xmath51 , provided we find ourselves in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite spin chain . aside from the two special cases outlined , however , the hamiltonian will in general be non - integrable at any point along the circuit ; this forces us to resort to numerical simulations of a limited number of spins , which moves the ising model s critical point outside our region of accessibility . on the other hand , when the magnetic field vector points in the @xmath49-direction , the hamiltonian does possess a critical point , even for a _",
    "finite _ number of spins , as outlined in the following .",
    "a special case of the class of hamiltonians ( [ eq : generalham ] ) occurs when the magnetic field vector points in the @xmath49-direction : @xmath52 this hamiltonian is purely classical : its two constituent terms commute and are diagonal in the \\ { } eigenbasis . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate that @xmath53 possesses a critical point  @xcite at @xmath54 .",
    "it is not difficult to find the ground state of this model . when @xmath55 , it is simply @xmath56 with the corresponding ( non - degenerate ) ground state energy given by @xmath57 .    in the regime @xmath58 ,",
    "the situation is only slightly more involved as the parity of @xmath3 now becomes important . for an _ even _ number of spins , the ( doubly degenerate ) ground state energy is given by @xmath59 , the corresponding eigenstates being @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for",
    "an _ odd _ number of spins , the ground state energy is @xmath3-fold degenerate and reads @xmath62 .",
    "the ground state is given by @xmath63 and all @xmath3 translations thereof . in order to convince oneself that this is indeed the correct ground state",
    ", one can easily show that no individual spin flip is capable of lowering the energy any further .    from the analysis above it follows that the ground state energy @xmath64 can always be written as a function of @xmath65 , demonstrating non - analyticity at the critical point @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the energy gap vanishes in the region @xmath58 .",
    "in light of the previous discussion , the parameter circuit which suggests itself is the following : a regular polygon residing on the bloch sphere of which one edge is bisected by the @xmath49-axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch2 ] .",
    "as we move along the vertices of the circuit , the critical @xmath49-axis is crossed in the direction of positive @xmath7-axis .",
    "we now turn to the results of our simulation of the bargmann invariant for the spin-@xmath2 chain , which are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinonehalf ] .",
    "the circuit used in the simulation is the regular polygon described in the previous section , but consists of @xmath66 vertices .",
    "[ tc][tc ] [ bc][bc ] [ tc][tc ] [ bc][bc ] +   +   +   +   +    the bargmann invariant and its phase were computed for different spin chain lengths , ranging in odd numbers from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinonehalf ] as increasing from the top .",
    "note that the results for even numbers of spins have been omitted as they showed no qualitative difference .",
    "this may be due to finite - size effects of the kind which have been observed in similar studies elsewhere , see for example ref .",
    "the left - hand column of the figure depicts the bargmann invariants @xmath69 on the unit disk in the complex plane .",
    "each data point of the graph stems from a different value of the coupling parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the right - hand column shows the corresponding bargmann phase @xmath70 , as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath71 , where @xmath72 refers to the radius of the circle within which the @xmath24-polygon circuit is inscribed .",
    "note that in this case the radius was chosen as @xmath73 , but the graphs , as they are plotted , are qualitatively independent of the size of this radius .",
    "we would like to point out several features that are apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : spinonehalf ] .",
    "first and foremost , the bargmann invariant @xmath69 is observed to always pass through the origin of the complex plane just when the spin coupling strength attains its critical value of @xmath74 . in other words ,",
    "the magnitude @xmath75 vanishes at the critical point .",
    "this is one of the features which we would like to propose as a signature of criticality , and is discussed further in section  [ subsection : magsignature ] .",
    "another trend that is immediately apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : spinonehalf ] is that with increasing spin chain length the bargamann invariants ` wind ever more loops ' around the origin .",
    "this statement can be made a little more precise by referring to the corresponding bargmann phases .",
    "these graphs are characterized by discontinuities at the critical point : ` jumps ' by @xmath76 alternating with ` jumps ' by @xmath0 . however , on joining up those separate pieces in the graphs end - to - end , one notices that the ` image ' covered by the resulting graphs grows with @xmath3 as @xmath77 .",
    "this result may be explained by way of referring to the @xmath78 limit of non - interacting spins for which the berry phase grows linearly with the number of spins .",
    "also note that for spin-@xmath26 chains , the ` joined - up ' bargmann phase covers twice as much ground for any given number of particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spinone ] ) .",
    "in addition , we should note that we obtain berry s solid angle result for the case of non - interacting spins , @xmath78 . approximating the solid angle of our regular polygon circuit as that of the enveloping cone , the bargmann phase @xmath12 asymptotically approaches berry s solid angle result as the number of vertices of the polygon",
    "is increased .    of course ,",
    "in the present work only spin chains of up to @xmath68 particles were simulated , and the exponential growth in the size of the hilbert space with increasing particle number precludes one from simulating chains that are much longer than that  @xcite .",
    "however , from the preceding discussion the trend for bargmann invariants and phases of longer spin chains should by now be fairly obvious . in particular",
    ", it has become clear that , perhaps surprisingly , precious little may be deduced about criticality from the bargmann phase . instead",
    ", a much clearer indication of the existence of a critical point is the vanishing magnitude of the bargmann invariant itself .",
    "it was already apparent from fig .",

    "note that qualitatively nothing changes as we increase the chain length ( tested up to @xmath86 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    of course , there is a perfectly plausible explanation for these results : as the circuit passes over the critical point the ground state changes abruptly , so that the overlap of the ground states on either side of the critical point will be rather small in magnitude .",

    "[ eq : phasedefn2 ] to be small .",
    "in fact , similar results were observed in a work by zanardi and paunkovi@xmath87  @xcite , who concluded that the ground state overlap function is itself a good characterization of qpts .",

    "qualitatively , the results for spin-@xmath26 chains are very similar to those of spin-@xmath2 chains . in particular , the magnitude of the bargmann invariant still represents a signature for the critical point .",
    "of note is also the fact that the ` joined - up ' bargmann phase extends twice as high for spin-@xmath26 chains as it does for spin-@xmath2 chains , for the same number of particles .",

    "in summary , we have shown how the magnitude and ` speed ' of the bargmann invariant can act as a signature of the critical point for the finite one - dimensional spin chain model considered .",

    "of course , this is very much in the spirit of this investigation , where bargmann invariants are assumed to take on a diagnostic role for critical points , even if in hindsight the existence of that critical point is easily demonstrated analytically .",
    "we note in passing that we have also developed matrix product state algorithms in an attempt to boost the number of particles we can simulate .",
    "however , these analyses have not succeded in producing qualitatively new results , over and obove those presented here ."

    "<S> the geometric phase can act as a signature for critical regions of interacting spin chains in the limit where the corresponding circuit in parameter space is shrunk to a point and the number of spins is extended to infinity ; for finite circuit radii or finite spin chain lengths , the geometric phase is always trivial ( a multiple of @xmath0 ) . in this work , by contrast , two related signatures of criticality are proposed which obey finite - size scaling and which circumvent the need for assuming any unphysical limits . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on the notion of the _ bargmann invariant _ whose phase may be regarded as a discretized version of berry s phase . as circuits </S>",
    "<S> are considered which are composed of a discrete , finite set of vertices in parameter space , they are able to pass directly _ through _ a critical point , rather than having to circumnavigate it . the proposed mechanism is shown to provide a diagnostic tool for criticality in the case of a given non - solvable one - dimensional spin chain with nearest - neighbour interactions in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>"
