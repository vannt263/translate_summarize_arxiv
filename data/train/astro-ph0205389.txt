    "it is now understood that intrinsic absorption is a common phenomenon in seyfert 1 galaxies , present in more than half of those observed with the spectrographs aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) . among those seyferts that show absorption , high ionization resonance lines such as n  v @xmath81238.8 , 1242.8 and c  iv @xmath81548.2 , 1550.8 are always present , along with ly@xmath4 , while lower ionization lines , such as si  iv @xmath81393.8 , 1402.8 , and mg  ii @xmath82796.3 , 2803.5 , are less common .",
    "the absorption lines can be blueshifted ( by up to 2100 km s@xmath6 ) with respect to the systemic velocities of the host galaxies , indicating net radial outflow .",
    "however , uv absorption lines can arise in dusty gas within the plane of the host galaxy ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2001 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "2002 ) ; these are often saturated and at velocities close to systemic .",
    "the ionic columns can be highly variable , which may be the result of changes in response to the ionizing continuum , as first suggested in case of ngc 4151 by bromage et al .",

    "in fact , both mechanisms may be at work in individual agn . in either case ,",
    "the variability is indicative of the promixity of the absorbers to the central active nucleus of these galaxies ; in the case of ngc 4151 , constraints on the density and ionization of the strongest absorption system place it within 0.03 pc of the continuum source ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "the presence of intrinsic absorption , typically in the form of bound - free edges of o  vii and o  viii , has been detected in the x - ray spectra of a similar fraction of seyfert 1 galaxies ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al .",
    "most recently , spectra obtained with the _ chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) _ have revealed that x - ray absorption lines associated with this material are also blue - shifted ( kaastra et al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , collinge et al .",
    "the connection between the x - ray and uv absorption is complex and there is likely a range of physical conditions within the absorbers ( see kriss et al .",
    "1996a ; kriss et al .",
    "2000 ; krolik & kriss 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the x - ray absorbers in some sources must also be multi - zoned ( otani et al .",
    "1996 ; reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "ngc 3516 ( @xmath9 @xmath10 0.00875 ) is one of the few seyfert 1 galaxies with uv absorption lines ,",
    "specifically n  v , c  iv , and si  iv , strong enough to have been detected with the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ ( ulrich & boisson 1983 ) .",
    "these lines are known to vary on timescales as short as weeks ( voit , shull , & begelman 1987 : walter et al .",
    "1990 ; kolman , halpern , & martin 1993 ) .",
    "walter et al . suggested that the c  iv absorption consists of a narrow , apparently stable component in the core of the broad emission lines and a variable , broad , blue - shifted component .",

    "( 1996 ) found the blueshifted component present in _",
    "spectra in 1978 , but it had disappeared between 1989 and 1993 , and has been absent in subsequent _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( hut ) ( kriss et al .",

    "( 1998 ) determined that the absorption in the core of the line ( walter et al.s `` stable '' component ) consisted of two broad components , with velocities of @xmath5380 and @xmath5 150 km s@xmath6 , and two narrow components at @xmath590 and @xmath530 km s@xmath6 .",
    "ngc 3516 also exhibits strong , variable x - ray absorption ( kolman et al .",
    "1993 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ; kriss et al .",
    "1996a ; mathur , wilkes , & aldcroft 1997 ) .",
    "although mathur et al . ( 1997 ) suggested that the x - ray and uv absorption arises in gas characterized by a single set of physical conditions , kriss et al .",
    "( 1996a ) modeled the x - ray absorber as two zones , one with an ionization parameter ( the ratio of the density of photons with energies @xmath11 13.6 ev to the number density of hydrogen atoms at the illuminated face of the zone ) u @xmath10 1.66 and a total hydrogen column density of 1.4 x 10@xmath12 @xmath13 and a lower ionization zone with u @xmath10 0.32 and a total column density of 6.9 x 10@xmath14 @xmath13 , and argued that not all of the uv lines could form in these zones . in our previous paper ( netzer et al .",
    "2002 ; hereafter paper i ) , we presented an analysis of the _ cxo_/low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letgs ) spectrum obtained on 2000 october 6 .",
    "the x - ray continuum flux , flux@xmath15 @xmath10 ( 1.6 @xmath16 0.2 ) x 10@xmath17 photons @xmath13 s@xmath6 kev@xmath6 , was close to its historic minimum , roughly a factor of 8  10 below maximum ( observed in 1994 with _ asca _ ) .",
    "we found that the variations in observed flux and spectra at these epochs is consistent with an absorber of constant column density ( 7.9 x 10@xmath14 @xmath13 ) whose ionization state has changed in response to the variation in the ionizing continuum , specifically : for the current low flux state , u @xmath10 0.19 , while it would be a factor of 8 to 10 higher in the high flux state ( depending on the amplitude of the uv continuum variations ) , in rough agreement with the high ionization component described by kriss et al . ( 1996a ) .",
    "the model predicts large column densities ( @xmath3 10@xmath18 @xmath13 ) for n  v and c  iv , hence one or more of the observed kinematic components of the uv absorption should be associated with the x - ray absorber .",
    "we obtained echelle spectra of ngc 3516 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on hst under a stis guaranteed time observer program . in this paper , we present our analysis of the physical conditions in the uv absorbers , nature of their variability , and the connection to the x - ray absorption detected in our contemporaneous _ cxo_/letgs observation .",
    "we obtained stis echelle spectra of the nucleus of ngc 3516 through a 02 x 02 aperture on 2000 october 1 .",
    "these observations and two previous observations of the c  iv region with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) are detailed in table 1 .",
    "the reduction of the ghrs spectra is described in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "we reduced the stis echelle spectra using the idl software developed at nasa s goddard space flight center for the stis instrument definition team .",
    "the data reduction includes a procedure to remove the background light from each order using a scattered light model devised by lindler ( 1999 ) .",
    "the individual orders in each echelle spectrum were spliced together in the regions of overlap .",
    "figure 1 compares the c  iv regions from the high - resolution spectra obtained at the three epochs . as noted in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) , the ghrs observations in 1995 showed four kinematic components of absorption in c  iv ( which we will refer to as the `` core components '' ) . although there was a decrease in the underlying continuum plus broad c  iv emission over the six - month interval in 1995 , there was no evidence for a change in the ionic column density ( or radial velocity coverage ) of any component .",
    "the new stis observations in 2000 october show a further decrease in the continuum plus broad c  iv emission , plus a dramatic change in some of the c  iv absorption components . in the stis spectrum , there is a strong absorption feature at the position of the weak ghrs components 3 and 4 .",
    "in addition , there is significant new absorption in the blue wing of the broad c  iv profle , in the 1553  1559   region .",
    "this new absorption is reminiscent of the broad , variable blueshifted absorption seen in the c  iv profile from early _ iue _ observations ( koratkar et al .",
    "1996 ) , which will be discussed later in this section .",
    "there is no evidence for significant changes in components 1 and 2 , which are heavily saturated at all three epochs .",
    "figure 2 shows portions of the stis e140 m spectra where intrinsic absorption is detected in other ions .",
    "fluxes are plotted as a function of the radial velocity ( of the strongest member , for doublets ) , relative to the systemic redshift of z @xmath10 0.00875 from the optical emission lines ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , since h  i 21-cm measurements are not available .",
    "each of the original 4 absorption components are present in ly@xmath4 and the doublets of n  v @xmath8 1238.8 , 1242.2 and c  iv @xmath0 1548.2 , 1550.8 .",
    "in addition , si  iv @xmath8 1393.8 , 1402.8 absorption is present in components 1 and 2 .",
    "we have also detected c  ii @xmath01334.5 , c  ii * @xmath01335.7 ( fine - structure line ) , and mg ii @xmath8 2796.3 , 2803.5 intrinsic absorption , all in component 1 only .",
    "we have not reliably detected any other intrinsic absorption line in the e140 m or e230 m spectra .",
    "we have separated the new blueshifted absorption into four distinct kinematic components ( 5  8 ; which we will refer to as the `` blueshifted components '' ) .",
    "our criteria for identification of a component are that it must be distinct in radial velocity space ( i.e. , not severely blended with other components ) , and clearly present in n  v or c  iv .",
    "component 5 is by far the strongest and broadest new component , whereas components 6  8 are relatively weak .",
    "the procedures we used to measure the intrinsic absorption lines follow those of crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . to determine the shape of the underlying emission , we fit a cubic spline to regions on either side of the absorption , and then normalized the absorption profiles by dividing the observed spectra by the spline fits .",
    "we determined the covering factor c@xmath19 , which is the fraction of continuum plus emission that is occulted by the absorber in our line of sight , using the technique of hamann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for doublets .",
    "we have relied on the c  iv doublets to determine these values , since many of the n  v doublets are contaminated by galactic absorption or blending of kinematic components . due to the modest signal - to - noise of the spectra and blending of components in the wings , c@xmath19 can only be determined reliably in the cores of the lines .",
    "we are not able to accurately deconvolve components 3 and 4 in the stis spectra ( see figure 2 ) , so they are treated as one component ( 3@xmath74 ) in this paper .",
    "table 2 gives the radial velocity centroids , widths ( fwhm ) , covering factors , and associated one - sigma errors for each kinematic component .",
    "these velocity centroids represent the means and standard deviations determined from the measurements of the c  iv , n  v , si  iv , and ly@xmath4 profiles ( when available for the latter two ) .",
    "compared to the ghrs measurements ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , there is no evidence for a change in the radial velocities of components 1  4 , except for perhaps a slight shift in component 2 from @xmath5148 km s@xmath6 ( ghrs ) to @xmath5183 km s@xmath6 ( possibly due to increased absorption in the blue wing of this component ) .",
    "the radial velocity centroid of component 3@xmath74 is very close to the position of the ghrs value for component 4 , suggesting ( but not proving ) that component 4 may be the one responsible for the large increase in absorption .",
    "our original suggestion that components 3 and 4 may be due to the interstellar medium or halo of the host galaxy ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1998 ) is therefore still a possible explanation for one of these components ( probably component 3 ) , but not the other ( our models are based on the assumption that these components are essentially co - located , near the ionizing source ) .    to determine the fwhm of the components , we used values from relatively unsaturated lines , to get an indication of the true velocity spread for each component .",
    "thus , we used the stis si  iv lines for components 1 and 2 , the ghrs c  iv lines for components 3 and 4 , and the stis ly@xmath4 , n  v , and c  iv lines for components 5  8 . for components 1 and 2 ,",
    "the fwhms are therefore smaller than those measured from the ghrs c  iv profiles ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) , since the latter are heavily saturated .",
    "next , we examine the covering factors in table 2 .",
    "the covering factors for components 1 and 2 are _ consistent _ with a value of one , although we can not rule out the possibility that they are as small as 0.96 .",
    "component 3@xmath74 shows the strongest evidence for a non - unity covering factor .",
    "although the aperture for the stis observations is small , there is likely to be some emission from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) that is unocculted ( see kraemer et al .",
    "2001 ; brotherton et al .",
    "this could explain the nonuntity covering factor for component 3@xmath74 since it is near the systemic redshift , where the nlr contribution is strongest .",
    "to illustrate this point , we have have simulated the nlr contribution by reproducing gaussians at the systemic velocity in figure 2 .",
    "we kept the doublet ratios fixed at 2:1 , chose a single value for the fwhm ( @xmath10 165 km s@xmath6 ) that provided a good overall fit , and scaled the intensities to obtain the best fit for each ion .",
    "given our assumptions , the nlr emission provides a reasonably accurate match to the troughs of the saturated lines ( note the contamination of n  v @xmath01242.8 by galactic s  ii ) .",
    "the error in covering factor for component 5 is too large to make a definite conclusion .",
    "we could not determine reliable values for components 6  8 , since the profiles are shallow and relatively noisy .",
    "lower limits from l@xmath4 and estimates from n  v are consistent with the covering factors determined from c  iv .",
    "to determine the ionic column densities , we converted each normalized profile to optical depth as a function of radial velocity , and integrated across the profile , as described in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for components 1 and 2 ,",
    "the si  iv profiles are much narrower than the profiles of ly@xmath4 , n  v , and c  iv , suggesting that the latter are heavily saturated ( assuming the same intrinsic velocity dispersion for all ions ) . by the same token ,",
    "components 3 and 4 in the ghrs spectra are narrow in c  iv compared to the stis component 3@xmath74 , again suggesting heavy saturation in the latter .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of nonunity covering factors for components 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath74 suggests that the column densities may be much larger than would be determined for c@xmath19 = 1 .",
    "thus , we can only determine lower limits to the column densties for these lines ( by assuming c@xmath19 = 1 ) , and the column densities for components 1 and 2 from the ghrs spectra ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) should be taken as lower limits . for component 5 , even if c@xmath19 = 0.6 , the depth of the lines are such that they are not heavily saturated . as we mentioned previously ,",
    "we do not have reliable measurements of c@xmath19 for components 6  8 . since these components are shallow , they are unlikely to be saturated ( including ly@xmath4 in these components ) , unless the covering factors are extremely small , which seems unlikely .",
    "thus , we have assumed c@xmath19 @xmath10 1 for components 5  8 .",
    "table 3 gives our measurements of stis and ghrs column densities for all lines that have been detected in at least one component .",
    "we include lower limits for heavily saturated lines and upper limits for undetected lines to constrain the photoionization models .      to pursue a possible connection between the continuum flux and the strength of the c  iv absorption",
    ", we have examined all of the far - uv spectra that have been obtained of ngc 3516 .",
    "table 4 lists the additional far - uv spectra ( i.e. , those not listed in table 1 ) , which were obtained at lower spectral resolutions by the _ iue _ , _ hut _ , and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst_. we have retrieved the most recently processed versions of these spectra from the _ iue _ and _ hst _ archives in order to measure their continuum fluxes and examine their c  iv profiles .",
    "for the _ hut _ spectrum , we determined the continuum flux directly from the plot in kriss et al .",
    "( 1996b ) .",
    "we measured the continuum fluxes by averaging the points in a bin centered at 1460    ( observed frame ) with a width of 20  .",
    "we determined the one - sigma flux errors from the standard deviations of the averages ; for the _ iue _ spectra , this technique is known to overestimate the errors ( clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) , and we scaled the errors for these observations by a factor of 0.7 to ensure that observations taken on the same day agreed to within the errors ( on average ) .",
    "for the two ghrs spectra , the continuum regions adjacent to the broad c  iv emission profile were not observed . in this case",
    ", we used separate fits to the continuum and broad emission in the stis c  iv region and tried different linear combinations of these fits until an accurate match was obtained to the continuum plus broad emission in each ghrs spectrum .",
    "figure 3 shows that the far - uv continuum of ngc  3516 has varied dramatically over a span of 22 years .",
    "early _ iue _ observations were obtained when ngc 3516 was in low to moderate states , whereas later observations , including the intensive monitoring campaign of 1996 ( @xmath3jd 2,490,000 , see koratkar et al .",
    "1996 ) , were obtained primarily at a high state .",
    "the last _ iue _ observations and subsequent observations by other instruments demonstrate the rapid variability of ngc 3516 ; in particular , the fos observations show a factor of 5 variation ( ratio of brightest to faintest ) over the course of 11 months ( see goad et al . 1999 ) . however , the trend is to lower flux levels in the most recent obervations .",
    "the new stis observations were obtained at very low ( but not unprecedented ) continuum flux levels .    to examine the previous behavior of the c  iv profile as a function of continuum luminosity",
    ", we have placed the _ iue _",
    "spectra into three categories based on their continuum fluxes at 1460  : low ( 0  2.0 x 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath6 ) , medium ( 2.0  4.0 x 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath6 ) , and high ( 4.0  7.0 x 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath6 ) .",
    "we averaged the spectra ( weighting by exposure time ) in each category .",
    "figure 4 shows the average spectra in the c  iv profiles .",
    "for comparison , we binned the ghrs and stis spectra to the same wavelength sampling as the _ iue _ spectra ( 1.67    per bin ) , and smoothed slightly to match the _ iue _ resolution ( 6     fwhm ) .",
    "we overplot the binned high - state ghrs and low - state stis spectra in figure 4 .",
    "the _ iue _ spectra in figure 4 show a remarkable change in the c  iv profile as a function of continuum luminosity .",
    "the blue emission peak just shortward ( in wavelength ) of the central absorption feature is stronger than the red peak at high luminosity , but becomes weaker and shifts to shorter wavelength at lower luminosities .",
    "the binned ghrs and stis spectra show the same effect .",
    "comparison with figure 1 shows that this effect is due to increased absorption from components 5  8 in the low - state stis spectrum .",
    "this effect has been noticed in previous _",
    "iue _ studies .",
    "walter et al . ( 1990 ) characterized the c  iv absorption in _ iue _ spectra as a blend of a narrow stable component in the core of the emission line plus a variable broad and blueshifted component .",
    "the similar appearances of the low - state _ iue _ and stis c  iv profiles indicate that the variable blue - shifted absorption covers a similar range in radial velocity , and _",
    "suggest _ that they originate from the same kinematic components",
    ". this would not be too surprising , since long - term stability in the radial velocities of absorption components is a common trait in seyfert 1 galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "koratkar et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the blueshifted component disappeared in _",
    "spectra between 1989 october and 1993 february ( when ngc 3516 was in a high state ) . at the time , it was not clear if this effect was due to evolution of the absorbers ( e.g. , bulk motion of gas out of the line of sight ) or to a change in the ionization of the gas ( e.g. , a decrease in the c  iv column due to an increase in the ionizing continuum , coincident with the increase in the uv continuum ) .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence that indicate that the latter ( variable ionization ) is certainly an important , and probably dominant , contributor to the c  iv absorption variability .",
    "1 ) our examination of individual _ iue _ spectra indicate that the c  iv profile variability is more correlated with continuum flux than with time . in particular , the moderately high states at early times and the moderately low states at the end of the _ iue _ observations confirm the above trend .",

    "( 1990 ) found an anticorrelation between continuum flux and c  iv equivalent width in the _ iue _ spectra , consistent with this scenario .",
    "3 ) the individual fos observations , which span a large range ( factor of 5 ) in continuum flux , show the same effect of decreasing blue peak with decreasing flux ( see the spectra in goad et al .",
    "4 ) the high resolution stis and ghrs spectra confirm this effect , and identify the kinematic components responsible for the change in the c  iv profile .",
    "we note that the same effect has been seen in the intrinsic o  vi absorption in ngc  3516 ( hutchings et al .",
    "2001 ) : high - velocity absorption ( consistent with components 5  8) appeared in a low - state _ fuse _ observation , but was not apparent in a moderately high - state _ hut _ observation obtained five years earlier .",
    "thus , we believe we have strong evidence for variable ionization of the absorption in ngc  3516 , such that the high - velocity uv absorption disappears at high continuum fluxes .",
    "photoionization models for this study were generated using the code cloudy90 ( ferland et al .",
    "we have modeled the absorbers as matter - bounded slabs of atomic gas , irradiated by the ionizing continuum radiation emitted by the central source . as per convention",

    ". for the models , we have assumed only thermal broadening , since 1 ) the absorption line widths could be due to the superposition of unresolved kinematic components and 2 ) comparison models assuming turbulent velocities of @xmath24 300 km s@xmath6 predict nearly identical ionic columns .",
    "since the strongest absorption lines in components 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath74 ( ly@xmath4 , n  v , and c  iv ) are saturated , we can only compare the model predictions to lower limits for the ionic column densities .",
    "however , the predictions for these components are constrained by the upper limits , or relatively small column densities , derived for lower ionization species , such as c  ii and mg  ii .",

    "the absorbing gas is assumed to be free of cosmic dust .      as discussed in section 2 ,",
    "the covering factor for each of the core components of absorption is @xmath37 0.9 .",
    "hence , the simplest geometric arrangement has the absorbers separated in radial position from the central source , but subtending the same solid angle , i.e. , `` screening '' each other from the ionizing continuum . as a result ,",
    "the ionizing continuum that reaches the absorbers is diluted by the inverse square of its distance and filtered by intervening gas .",
    "this arrangement has important consequences for the response of the screened absorbers to changes in the luminosity of the central source , since they are affected by both changes in the ionizing flux _ and _ the opacity of the intervening gas .",
    "the core components were present in c  iv in ghrs spectra taken while the continuum flux of ngc 3516 was @xmath11 4 times higher than during our stis observations , and components 1 and 2 were highly saturated ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the stis",
    "spectra each of the core components possesses saturated ly@xmath4 , n  v , and c  iv lines .",
    "component 1 has saturated si  iv and lines from several low ionization species , hence must be the most optically thick at the he  ii lyman limit .",
    "based on our photoionization models , the most dramatic changes in the transmitted ionizing continuum occur when there is a large drop in the he  ii opacity , to the extent that a screened component which possessed a c  iv column of @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath13 ( e.g. , a model with n@xmath21 @xmath10 10@xmath14 @xmath13 and a low - state ionization parameter u @xmath10 0.1 ) , would have essentially all of its carbon ionized out of c  iv during the high state .",
    "since each of these absorbers was present while ngc 3516 was in a high flux state , it is unlikely that component 1 is closest to the ionizing source . expanding on this",
    ", we found that the best fit to the observed ionic columns is achieved when the three components are arranged in increasing order of he  ii optical thickness , specifically : component 3@xmath74 lying closest , followed by 2 , then 1 .",
    "similarly , the absence of the blueshifted components during high flux states of ngc 3516 is consistent with them being screened by gas that is optically thick during low flux states , and hence we chose to have them positioned outside the core components .",
    "we have attempted to model each kinematic component as a single zone , adding additional zones only when necessary . as typical in such analyses ,",
    "the resulting model parameters are a possible , but not necessarily unique , solution set .",
    "however , the dual constraints of screening and the total x - ray opacity significantly reduce the parameter space for the models .",
    "finally , the true test for this geometry and physical parameters is whether such a model can replicate the high - state column densities , as we discuss in section 4.3 .",
    "the model parameters for each component , including u , n@xmath21 , and @xmath39 ( the mean electron temperature ) , are listed in table 5 .",
    "implicit in our assumptions is that the distances between these components are significantly smaller than their average radial distance , i.e , they are roughly co - located . also , note that the predicted temperatures are sensitive to the choice of density and , hence , should be considered as very rough approximations .    the predicted ionic columns for each component are compared to the measured values in table 6 ( for the full set of predicted column densities for the core components , see tables 7 through 10 ) . for component 3@xmath74 ,",
    "n@xmath21 and u were constrained by the lower limits to n@xmath22 n@xmath40 and n@xmath41 , and the upper limit to n@xmath42 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "component 2 is ionized by the continuum transmitted by 3@xmath74 , and is constrained by the value of n@xmath42 , as well as the aforementioned lower limits .",
    "both of these components were successfully modeled as single - zoned absorbers .    for component 1 , a single - zoned model underpredicts",
    "c  ii , while overpredicting mg  ii .",
    "this is a result of the ionization structure of the slab interior to the point where the gas becomes optically thick at the he  ii lyman limit ( 54.4 ev ) . at this point",
    "most of the magnesium is in the form of mg  iii , which has an ionization potential of 80 ev , little of which can be ionized to mg  iv by the heavily absorbed ionizing continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the carbon is c  iv , since c  iii has an ionization potential of 47.7 ev , i.e. , below that of he  ii .",
    "hence , while mg  ii is populated by recombination of mg  iii , there is little c  ii , due to the relatively small fraction of carbon in the form of c  iii .",
    "if the ionization parameter is significantly lower , the higher ionization states are less populated due to the paucity of ionizing photons , and the situation is mitigated , in the sense that the c  iii and mg  iii zones overlap more completely .",
    "hence , we used a two - zoned model to fit component 1 .",
    "the choice of parameters for the two components is somewhat arbitrary , however , for the sake of simplicity , we assumed that the n  v , c  iv , and si  iv arise in one component ( 1a ) , while the c  ii and mg  ii are formed in the other ( 1b ) .",
    "note that , while the prediction for n@xmath43 is quite good , the model overpredicts n@xmath44 by a factor of @xmath3 3.5 .",
    "this may be the consequence of our assumption of solar abundances , as we discuss in section 5.2 .",
    "interestingly , components 1a and 1b predict a combined neutral column of n@xmath22 @xmath2 10@xmath18 @xmath13 , which is less than half the column determined from the 1995 hut spectrum ( kriss et al . 1996a ) .",
    "part of the difference may be due to the contribution from component 2 , since these components are not separable at low resolution .",
    "however , the continuum flux observed by hut was roughly a factor of two higher than in the stis spectra and , as we discuss in section 4.2 , the total neutral column should , therefore , have been lower .",
    "nevertheless , we do not detect any additional low ionization lines in the stis spectra that might be associated with an unmodeled neutral component .",
    "this apparent discrepancy may be due to the presence of a small additional column of neutral gas within our line - of - sight during the time of the hut observations .    as shown in table 3 , the n@xmath41/n@xmath22 and n@xmath40/n@xmath22 ratios for the blueshifted components are unusual in the sense that both are large .",
    "although h  i columns can be quite small in very highly ionized gas ( u @xmath37 0.5 ) , the fractional populations of the lithium - like ionic states tend to be similary small . in part ,",
    "the unusual ionization balance in these components may be the result of illumination by a heavily absorbed continuum , which has very few photons with energies between 54.4 ev and 100 ev ( see figure 5 ) . in this case , n  v is produced by x - ray ionization of n  iv by photons with energies much greater than its ionization potential ; the photoionization cross - section at these energies is much lower than at the threshold energy . to overcome this inefficiency",
    ", the ionization parameter must be high ( @xmath37 0.5 ) , which in turn ionizes a greater fraction of the hydrogen than in gas exposed to an unfiltered continuum .",
    "while the n@xmath41/n@xmath40 ratios for the blueshifted components are well - fitted by the models , n@xmath22 is underpredicted for component 5 , and overpredicted for the other components .",
    "it must be noted that the overpredictions are _ much _ worse when an unfiltered continuum is used ( we did not include the effects of continuum filtering between these components , but they are all optically thin at the he  ii lyman limit , so the effect is negligible ) . somewhat more curious , given the casual similarity of these absorption features , is the large range in n@xmath21 and u ( see table 5 ) .",
    "however , these components experienced an extreme drop in the ionizing flux , due to the drop in the intrinsic continuum luminosity and the increase in opacity of the intervening gas , over which time they may have undergone large temperature changes ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "it is possible that the apparently peculiar ionization balance in these components is a result of this recent history .",
    "therefore , we only list the predicted columns for component 5 , which is the lowest ionization and most thermally stable ( which may explain why the predicted column densities are the most accurate ) .",
    "our models for the core components predict significant columns densities for c  vi , n  vi , o  vi , and o  vii , hence , significant x - ray opacities .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , the large he  ii column supresses the soft - xray flux .",
    "finally , the total column density for these components is n@xmath21 @xmath10 7.7 x 10@xmath14 @xmath13 , which is nearly identical to the single zone model described in paper i. so , it is likely that the uv absorbers are responsible for the x - ray absorption .    a full and detailed analysis of the x - ray spectra from ngc  3516 has already been presented in paper  i. we do not consider it necessary to repeat such an analysis here .",
    "however , in order to test and illustrate the hypothesis that the uv absorbers and x - ray absorbers are dominated by the same components , we have performed direct comparisons of the models and data . the ionic column densities for each of the core components",
    "( see tables 7  10 ) were used to predict the bound - free absorption edges in the x - ray band using the analytic expressions of verner & yakovlev ( 1995 ) and verner et al .",
    "we have excluded the blueshifted components since we have not constrained their physical states , although it is our belief that their column densities are too low to contribute much to the x - ray absorption .",
    "these were compared to the x - ray data assuming a galactic column density of @xmath45 appropriate for this line of sight ( murphy et al 1996 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that this direct and simple comparison does _ not _ include the additional spectral components discussed in the more detailed treatment of paper  i. specifically , here we do not include the compton `` reflection '' from optically - thick material which is likely to dominate the observed x - ray spectrum @xmath46  kev , or or any emission from any other circumnuclear material .    nevertheless assuming the sed described in section 3.1",

    "( 1996a ) .",
    "also interesting is the lack of evidence for highly ionized gas ( e.g. , u @xmath3 1 , n@xmath21 @xmath37 10@xmath14 @xmath13 ) within the line - of - sight to the active nucleus in ngc 3516 , in contrast to ngc 3783 ( kaspi et al .",

    "cxo_/letgs spectrum compared to earlier _ asca _ spectra were due to variations in the continuum flux and the corresponding changes in the ionization state and , therefore , opacity of the intervening absorber .",
    "since we have established that the uv and x - ray absorption occur in the same gas , it follows that the changes in uv absorbers must also be in response to variations in ionizing flux , rather than variations in total column density . as noted above",
    ", the continuum flux at 1460    was roughly 4.5 times greater in the ghrs observations than during the stis gto observations , and represents the agn in a high state .",
    "we assumed that the flux at the lyman limit scaled by the same factor .",
    "as there were no contemporaneous x - ray observations , we assumed that the 0.5 kev flux increased by a factor of 9 , as suggested in paper i. finally , we assumed that the @xmath4 remained @xmath10 @xmath51.0 between 13.6 ev and 100 ev , which requires a change in @xmath4 to @xmath51.87 from 100 ev to 500 ev ( although , clearly , we do not know how the sed may have changed in the euv to soft x - ray band ) . through an iterative analysis of the 1994 _ asca _ spectrum",
    ", we set the 0.5 to 10 kev spectral index to @xmath50.89 .",
    "in modeling the absorbers we held the column densities fixed and assumed the same relative positions .",
    "the high - state continuum increased q , and thus u for the unscreened gas , by a factor of @xmath2 4.6 .",
    "the predicted values of n@xmath40 for the core components are given in table 6 , and match the ghrs values well , although the prediction for component 2 , while still indicative of saturation , is slightly below the lower limit ( which may be indicative of a somewhat larger column density in the earlier epoch , as suggested by the limits on n@xmath22 determined from the hut spectrum [ kriss et al .",
    "1996a ] ) .",
    "interestingly , in the low - state models , all the c  iv associated with component 1 was from the higher ionization zone , while in the high - state both zones of component 1 contribute to it .",
    "the high - state model for component 5 predicts a negligibly small value for n@xmath40 , so the absence of the blueshifted components can also be explained by the higher ionizing flux .    as with the low - state models",
    ", we have taken the predicted columns densities ( see tables 11  14 ) and used them to model the _ asca _ data obtained in 1994 april ( e.g. george et al . 1998 ) when the nucleus of ngc  3516 was a factor of 8 to 10 ( at @xmath47  kev ) brighter ( and the compton `` reflected '' continuum less important ) .",
    "we followed the standard procedures for the reduction and analysis of _ asca _ data , ignoring the 57  kev band ( where there is emission from fe k@xmath4 ) , and fitting the time - averaged spectral data from all four _ asca _ detectors simultaneously .",
    "only the spectral index and normalization of the underlying power law continuum was allowed to vary during the analysis ( the bound - free absorption appropriate for the `` high - state '' column densities were fixed at the values predicted by the uv models ) . as expected , the index of the continuum was in good agreement with our assumptions concerning the sed ( @xmath48 at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in figure 6 , and it again matches the overall spectral characteristics . given the source is variable in both the x - ray band , and in the overall shape of the sed , and that there are no simultaneous high resolution uv measurements , we consider our predictions to be in remarkable agreement with the x - ray observations at this epoch .",
    "we have shown that our model for the uv absorbers , with the components arranged in increasing radial distance and each covering the continuum source , accurately predicts most of the ionic columns and the x - ray opacity .",
    "given the success of the model , we may use it as a starting point to unravel the geometry of the circumnuclear gas . in paper",

    "since the ionizing luminosity of ngc 3516 is only a factor of @xmath3 2 greater than ngc 4151 , observed in similar low - flux states , the greater ionization state must be mostly due to the lower density .",
    "another interesting difference is the weakness of the scattered light in the troughs of the saturated absorption lines in ngc 3516 : @xmath59 5% of the low - state continuum flux , compared to @xmath11 50% of the low - state flux in ngc 4151 ( kraemer et al .",

    "interestingly , in its current low - flux state , approximately 50% of the c  iv emission is from a component with fwhm of @xmath3 1500 km s@xmath6 ( see figure 2 and hutchings et al . [",
    "2001 ] ) , which is characteristic of the so - called intermediate line region ( ilr ; wills et al . [ 1993 ] ) .",
    "if the absorbers are the source of the ilr emission , the covering factor is @xmath3 0.3 .",
    "note , that although the core components cover both the broad and intermediate line contributions to the c  iv emission , this does not imply that they must lie outside the ilr .",
    "for example , self - absorption by the ilr gas could occur in an expanding shell ( see hutchings et al .",
    "if the absorption arises in the ilr , the ilr gas has a significant radial velocity component , similar to the emission - line gas in the inner nlr of other seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw & kraemer 2000 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; crenshaw et al . 2000b",
    "; ruiz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a connection between the ilr and nlr components has been suggested by sulentic & marziani ( 1999 ) , although our results suggest that the ilr could extend to the outer edge of the blr .      from our estimate of the intrinsic reddening ( see section 4.1 ) , one would infer that there is a component of dusty gas of column density n@xmath21 @xmath3 3 x 10@xmath30 @xmath13 along our line - of - sight to the nucleus of ngc 3516 .",
    "note that this is based on assumption of a galactic dust / gas ratio ; if the ratio were lower , the column would be larger . as shown in kraemer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , uv absorption lines can form in dusty gas surrounding an agn . typically , one would expect strong c  iv lines from a column of this size .",
    "hence , either the absorption lines associated with the dusty column are buried in the troughs of the core components , or the dust exists in one or more of these absorbers .",
    "following barvainis ( 1987 ) , we can estimate the dust sublimation radius , i.e , the point interior to which dust grains would evaporate . during its low - flux state ,",
    "the ionizing luminosity of the central source is @xmath3 1.4 x 10@xmath66 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "assuming an average luminosity a factor of 3 greater ( see section 2.3 ) , and a dust sublimation temperature of 1500 k ( salpeter 1977 ) , the sublimation radius for ngc 3516 is @xmath54 2.6 x 10@xmath18 cm , or , roughly the same radial distance as the core components .",
    "although the absorbers are radially outflowing , we do not know their starting point , or whether they were well - shielded from the continuum source by intervening gas .",
    "hence it is possible that some grains have survived within them .",
    "alternatively , some dust could have been swept - up by the absorbers as they move outwards .",
    "if , for example , the dust were within component 1 , it may help explain the overprediction of mg  ii ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , since the column density of component 1 is roughly 5 times larger than our dusty column , the dust / gas ratio could be 20% the galactic ratio ( indicative of the harsh conditions close to the active nucleus ) , and still produce the observed reddening . in any case , although it is possible the dust is in a heretofore undetected component of gas , we suggest that the reddening may be due to a small amount of dust within one or more of the core components .      perhaps the most unusual aspect of the intrinsic absorption in seyfert galaxies is the lack of evidence for radial acceleration . in the case of ngc 4151 ,",
    "weymann et al . (",
    "1997 ) attributed this to the large radial distances of the absorbers .",
    "however , in kraemer et al .",
    "( 2001a ) we determined that component d@xmath7e was close enough to the central source that it should undergo a detectable acceleration . to explain this",
    ", we suggested that the large column density and optical thickness of d@xmath7e would make radiative acceleration inefficient ( see williams 1972 ; mathews 1974 ) .",
    "the physical conditions in the core components of ngc 3516 are similar to d@xmath7e , hence the absence of detectable changes in radial velocities between 1995 and the present is understandable , although it is interesting that the blueshifted components , which only appear during lowstates , appear at generally the same velocities , and these are clearly optically thin ( of course , the radial acceleration of the absorbers may simply be too small to detect in the @xmath3 6 years between the ghrs and stis observations ) .",
    "another explanation is that the absorbers are not simply radially ( or even radiatively ) accelerated .",
    "disk - wind models ( e.g. , konigl & kartje 1994 ) require that the gas in the outflow must first be levitated off the accretion disk .",
    "bottorff , korista , & shlosman ( 2000 ) have modeled the absorbers as part of a magnetohydromagnetic wind , which has a strong non - radial component .",
    "elvis ( 2000 ) has also proposed an outflow scenario that includes a non - radial component .",
    "if the absorption arises in disk - driven wind , the gas would have a strong transverse component of velocity .",
    "however our analysis ( see also paper i ) suggests strongly that the variability of the absorption in ngc 3516 results from changes in ionization state due to the variable luminosity of the central source , rather than changes in column density due to transverse motion .",
    "one possibility is that the individual kinematic components are associated with different flow tubes or shells along our line - of - sight , which would originate at different radial positions at the base of the wind .",
    "since the total column density within the absorber does not appear to change , the amount of gas within these tubes must be fairly constant , although this does not imply confinement but , rather , a continuous flow .",
    "although the source luminosity changes dramatically , the flow density appears to be independent of the short - term changes in the flux , which may imply that it is not radiatively driven off the disk ( see , again , bottorff et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , in our model the radial velocities of components 1 through 5 increase with distance from the central source .",
    "this would be expected if they each originated at the roughly the same distance , and have been continuously accelerated , e.g. , via resonance line driving or some other radiative mechanism .",
    "however , the velocities can also depend on the radial distance at which the different components originated , hence a range in velocities may not be an indication of acceleration , but of different `` launch - pads '' for the components of the flow .",
    "another interesting aspect of the uv absorbers is their apparent stability ; the core components vary in ionization state but have shown evidence for significant c  iv columns for two decades . as discussed in krolik , mckee , & tarter ( 1981 ) and , more recently , in krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) , there are two regimes of ionization ( characterized by the `` pressure '' ionization parameter , or u / t ) and temperature wherein a cloud of photoionized gas is stable to thermal perturbations : at low ionization / temperature , when line cooling is efficient , and at high temperature / ionization , when thermal balance is achieved via compton processes . in the intermediate region ,",
    "small changes in ionization can result in large changes in temperature .",
    "although the exact relationship between u / t and t for a model nebula depends on the sed of the continuum radiation , including the non - ionizing continuum which is critical in the compton regime , and the atomic parameters , such as collision strengths , instability typically occurs between 5 x 10@xmath56 k and 10@xmath67 k. both our low- and high - state models for the core components predict that these absorbers remain thermally stable , which may help explain their continuing presence . on the other hand ,",
    "the blueshifted components may not be stable . in figure 7 , we show the instability curve for the screened sed used for the models of the blueshifted components . in the current low - state ,",
    "component 5 is in the low - temperature stable regime , while the more highly ionized components lie along the vertical , quasi - stable , region ( unstable regions are places where @xmath68 ) .",
    "this implies that these components have experienced large temperature fluctuations in response to the changes in ionizing flux , which may explain part of the discrepant model predictions .",
    "perhaps most of this gas is in the compton - cooled state , out of which uv absorbers condense when the continuum flux drops sufficiently .",
    "the variable opacity of the intervening core components amplifies the changes in ionizing flux and , hence , thermal perturbations of the blueshifted components .",
    "we have used medium - resolution echelle spectra obtained with _ hst_/stis to study the physical conditions in the uv absorbers in the seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc 3516 while it was in a recent low - continuum state . we have used contemporaneous _",
    "cxo_/letg data ( discussed in paper i ) to examine the connection between the uv and x - ray absorbers , and have compared our model results to archival , high - state ghrs and _ asca _ spectra .",
    "we find that the bulk of the uv and x - ray absorption arises in the same gas , principally components 1,2 , and 3@xmath74 .",
    "the line - of - sight covering factors for these components are all @xmath37 0.9 , hence they must be screening one another from the ionizing source .",
    "we have demonstrated that the historical changes in the properties of the absorbers are due to changes in their ionization state in response to different levels of the ionizing flux .",
    "the changes are more dramatic for the screened components , which are also affected by the changes in opacity of the intervening gas . in particular , the disappearance of components 5  8 in c  iv ( the variable blueshifted absorption seen in _ iue _",
    "spectra ) is due to the much higher ionization parameters at high states , as a result of the much lower opacities of components 1 4 .",
    "although there are apparent similarities between ngc 3516 and ngc 4151 , such as linear radio structure ( nagar & wilson 1998 ) , nlr kinematics ( ruiz et al . in preparation ) , and central source luminosity , there are striking differences in the appearance of their uv spectra .",
    "first , unlike ngc 4151 ( see kraemer et al .",
    "2001a ) , there is little evidence for scattered continuum radiation in a 02 x 02 aperture centered on the nucleus ; alternatively , the absorbers are _ covering _ the scattering region .",
    "second , in kraemer et al .",
    "( 2001a ) we argued that the x - ray absorption in ngc 4151 was due to a component of highly ionized gas which we were unable to identify among the uv absorbers , which is clearly not the case for ngc 3516 .",
    "finally , the absorbers in ngc 3516 are both in a higher ionization state and of lower density than those in ngc 4151",
    ". it will be interesting if these differences are intrinsic to these otherwise similar agn , or are a clue to the nature of mass outflow .",

    "<S> the uv continuum was @xmath34 times lower than that observed during 1995 with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , and the x - ray flux from a contemporaneous _ chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) _ observation was a factor of @xmath38 below that observed with _ </S>",

    "<S> we have achieved an acceptable fit to the x - ray data using the combined x - ray opacity of the uv components 1 , 2 and 3@xmath74 . by increasing the uv and x - ray fluxes of these models to match the previous high states , we are able to match the ghrs c  iv column densities , absence of detectable c  iv absorption in components 5 through 8 , and the 1994 _ asca _ spectrum . we conclude that variability of the uv and x - ray absorption in ngc 3516 is primarily due to changes in the ionizing flux . </S>"
