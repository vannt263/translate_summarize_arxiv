    "moving averages are probably the most popular and elemental analysis tool in finance , widely known and applied both by professional and amateur traders .",
    "such a large favour is due to their simplicity and intuitive meaning , which can help to understand the more or less hidden trend of an evolving dataset , filtering some of the noise .    moving averages",
    "are often studied and taken into account in modeling price dynamics both in financial literature and in textbooks for market traders ( technical analysis ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a model for price dynamics where a moving average plays a central role ( in the following with price we mean a more general class of financial objects , including share quotes , indices , exchange rates , and so on ) .",
    "we focus our attention on the logarithm of price , not the price itself , since the difference of two consecutive logarithmic prices corresponds to price return , being a universal measure of a price change , not affected by size factors .",
    "the moving average is therefore computed with logarithmic prices , but we do not simply look a time window in the past , giving the same weight to each past quote . on the contrary , we take into account every quote in the past , but its weight decays exponentially with time @xcite . this choice is suggested by several evidences that correlations between price changes rapidly go to zero @xcite , at variance with absolute price changes ( see for example @xcite ) .    in our price dynamics",
    "the difference between the logarithmic price and the moving average at a given time linearly influences the future price , together with noise .",
    "let us stress that the moving average can either attract or repulse the future price , being this a peculiar feature of the market considered .",
    "in turns out that the logarithmic price plus its moving average evolves following a one - step markov process .",
    "we test our model analyzing three datasets :    \\a ) nasdaq index : 4032 daily closes from 1st nov 1984 to 25th sep 2000 .",
    "\\b ) italian mibtel index : 1700 daily closes from 4th gen 1994 to 2nd oct 2000 .",
    "\\c ) 1998 us dollar - deutsche mark ( usd - dm ) bid exchange rate : 1620861 high frequency data , that represent all worldwide 1998 bid quotes , made available by olsen & associated .",
    "the average time difference between two consecutive data is about @xmath0 seconds .",
    "the results give a clear evidence that our model for price dynamics is fully consistent with all the above datasets .",
    "we also study the problem of finding an optimal strategy for repeated trading operations in the context of our model , giving an analytic solution for a realistic situation ( small differences between logarithmic price and moving average ) .",
    "in particular , we show that a simple suboptimal strategy implies a capital growth rate larger than the growth rate of the underlying asset .",
    "this simple result highlights a certain degree of market inefficiency .",
    "let us briefly sum up the contents of the paper .    in sect .",
    "ii the model of price dynamics is introduced , and the exact solution is derived .    in sect .",
    "iii the model is tested against the three datasets , fixing the free parameters of the theory for each case .    in sect .",
    "iv strategies for repeated trades are investigated , in order to find the optimal one .    in sect .",
    "v a suboptimal trading strategy is applied to the three datasets , showing that markets hide some inefficiency .    in sect .",
    "vi some conclusions and some final remarks are presented .",
    "price returns ( i.e. the difference of two consecutive logarithmic prices ) are widely investigated in finance , since their dynamics does not depend on size factors . for this reason we prefer to introduce a model for price dynamics that focuses its attention on logarithmic price , instead of price itself .",
    "let us consider the price @xmath1 of a financial object ( an index , an exchange rate , a share quote ) at time @xmath2 , and define the logarithmic price as @xmath3 .",
    "a moving average @xmath4 based on logarithmic prices , that takes into account all the past with an exponentially time decaying weight , can be written in the form    @xmath5    the moving average at time @xmath2 is computed only with past quotes with respect to @xmath2 , and @xmath6 is not included .",
    "this is not a relevant choice , since all the following could be reformulated in an equivalent way , including @xmath6 in the moving average .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 controls the memory length : for @xmath8 we have the shortest ( one step ) memory @xmath9 , while when @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 the memory becomes infinity and flat ( all the past prices have the same weight ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath10 determines the typical past time scale @xmath12 up to that we have a significant contribution in the average ( [ average ] ) .",
    "let us suppose that future price linearly depends on the difference between the current price and the moving average , plus a certain degree of randomness . in our model @xmath13 is written as    @xmath14 + \\sigma\\omega(t ) \\ \\ , \\label{model}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath15 at varying @xmath2 are a set of independent identically distributed random variables , with vanishing mean and unitary variance , so that @xmath16 is a random variable of variance @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , our analysis focuses on the problem of correlations with moving averages and we expect that results would not qualitatively depend on the shape of @xmath18 distribution , which likely is a fat tails distribution @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 adjusts the impact of the difference @xmath20 over the future price .",
    "notice that a positive @xmath21 means that the moving average is repulsive ( the price most likely has a positive change if @xmath6 is larger then @xmath4 ) , on the contrary the moving average is attractive if @xmath21 is negative . also notice that the process loses all memory from the past for @xmath22 , independently on @xmath10 , becoming a pure random walk .",
    "let us stress that the vasicek model @xcite is a particular case in our more general scheme , corresponding to the peculiar choice @xmath23 .",
    "according to ( [ model ] ) , the return @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 , turns out to be @xmath26 + \\sigma\\omega(t)$ ] .",
    "let us stress that the first contribution is measurable at time @xmath2 just before the price change and , therefore , is an available information for the trader .",
    "it is easy to check that the moving average ( [ average ] ) satisfies    @xmath27    equations ( [ model ] ) and ( [ aver - eq ] ) define a two - component linear markov process .",
    "such a process can be solved by a diagonalization procedure . after having defined @xmath28 and @xmath29 which must satisfy @xmath30",
    ", we introduce a new couple of variables , linear combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath4 @xmath31 being @xmath32 simply the difference between the logarithmic price and its moving average at time @xmath2 .",
    "the system turns out to be diagonal in terms of the new variables @xmath33 and therefore can be easily solved , obtaining @xmath34    the steady distribution @xmath35 of @xmath36 can be derived from equation ( [ sol - diag ] ) , once given the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the variance of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , can be directly computed @xmath38 where @xmath39 means average over the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the solution in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath4 can be obtained from ( [ sol - diag ] ) by using the inverse transformation of ( [ linear ] ) @xmath40 \\right ] \\\\",

    "in order to test our model against real financial data , we need to find a measurable quantity that can be computed without specifying the @xmath18 distribution . for this reason ,",
    "a direct comparison of the logarithmic prices @xmath6 with financial datasets can not be of some help .",
    "on the contrary the variance of any time window is independent on the details of @xmath18 distribution .",
    "it is , therefore , intuitive to consider @xmath41 , the @xmath42-days quadratic volatility scaled with @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle \\ \\ .\\ ] ] in the context of our model , the above quantity is @xmath44 \\ , \\ , \\ , .",

    "notice also that the one - step ( @xmath45 ) quadratic volatility is @xmath46 , which is always larger than @xmath17 . in other terms , the one - step volatility is not simply @xmath47 , the component due to the random variables , but it is systematically larger due to the influence of the moving average . in the long range",
    "( @xmath48 ) @xmath41 tends to @xmath49 , which is larger ( smaller ) then @xmath17 for positive ( negative ) @xmath21 .",
    "the expression ( [ tvol ] ) of @xmath41 can be fitted with real data varying the free parameters @xmath21 , @xmath10 and @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "1 @xmath41 is plotted for three datasets : nasdaq index ( fig .",
    "1a ) , mibtel index ( fig .",
    "1b ) and 1998 usd - dm high frequency exchange rate ( figs .",
    "1c and 1d ) .    in the first two cases",
    "the agreement between data and expression ( [ tvol ] ) predicted by our model is excellent up to a critical value of @xmath42 , which depends on the size of the dataset . for @xmath42 larger than the critical value insufficient statistics makes the experimental values no longer significant .    in particular",
    ", we have obtained the following results :    \\a ) nasdaq index : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 ;    \\b ) mibtel index : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the range @xmath57 ;    the two daily indices not only behave qualitatively the same , but also exhibit similar parameters .",
    "the main result is that they have a positive @xmath21 , which means that the moving average repulses the spot price .",
    "moreover , in both cases the typical memory length is about 2 time steps , which corresponds to a couple of trading days , and @xmath47 , which is nearly the daily market volatility , turns out to be about @xmath58 .",
    "let us stress that this is only the random component of daily volatility , this last being larger because of the deterministic component contribution .",
    "the 1998 usd - dm exchange rate case is more complex , since it exhibits a sort of transition phase .",
    "in fact @xmath41 turns out to be the union of two different curves of type ( [ tvol ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1c ) :    \\c ) 1998 usd - dm exchange rate :    @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the range @xmath62 ;    @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the range @xmath66 .",
    "the agreement between data and the two fits is remarkable .",
    "the transition point corresponds to @xmath67 ( about 2.5 minutes ) , as shown in fig.1d where the range @xmath68 is magnified .",
    "this peculiar behaviour can be explained taking into account that the price behaves like a quantum variable on time scales from seconds to one or two minutes , according to a sort of indeterminacy principle @xcite .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown that @xmath69 does not vanish in the @xmath70 limit , which means that two almost contemporary exchange rate bids not necessary coincide .",
    "it is than reasonable to argue that the transition at @xmath67 in fig .",
    "1c and fig .",
    "1d corresponds to the transition between quantum behaviour and classical behaviour for the price .    in any case",
    "the usd - dm high frequency exchange rate has a negative @xmath21 , which means that the moving average attracts the spot price .",
    "moreover it exhibits a more consistent influence of the moving average with respect to the indices , since @xmath71 is about one order of magnitude larger , and the typical memory turns out to be about 7 - 8 time steps ( 2.5 minutes ) .",
    "a market is said efficient if prices reflect all the available information , that is , a speculator can not make a profit with probability one in the long run . evidence for a certain degree of inefficiency in financial markets has been recently found ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our price dynamics model points out that there exists a contribution in price formation of non random nature and , therefore , it is interesting to check if the associated information is fully absorbed by the market or partially left available for speculators . in this section",
    "we set up trading strategies based on our model , which will be applied to financial datasets in the next section : a performance much more successful than the implicit growth of the crude data , given by a buy and hold strategy , will imply a clear evidence of inefficiency .    in order to do this check ,",
    "let us consider a kelly - like scheme of repeated investments @xcite : kelly considered a long run of repeated random events , being fixed the probability of the outcome of a single event and the fraction of capital bet at each time .",
    "he proved that the capital growth rate is a non random quantity in the limit of infinite events ( in this limit the probability of have a growth rate different from the typical value goes to zero ) .",
    "then he was able to maximize the capital growth rate with respect to the fraction of capital invested , showing a linear relation between the rate itself and the shannon entropy of the random sequence .    in our case , given a capital @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the fraction invested at time @xmath2 in an asset of price @xmath1 , which can be modified at each time .",
    "since the price return @xmath24 in our model depends only on the difference @xmath74 and on the parameter @xmath47 , the same should be true for @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath75 . then the capital @xmath72 evolves according to @xmath76   w(t ) \\ \\ , \\ ] ] and the associated growth rate is therefore @xmath77 @xmath78    our goal is to find the optimal @xmath79 which gives the maximum growth rate @xmath80 for a given set @xmath21 , @xmath10 and @xmath47 .",
    "large number theory can be applied to right hand side of ( [ rate ] ) since the variables in the sum are weakly correlated in time , in fact , the @xmath81 are uncorrelated , and the @xmath32 are related via the moving averages , whose correlations decay exponentially by construction . as a consequence ,",
    "the fraction of capital invested no longer depends on @xmath2 , and taking the maximum with respect to @xmath82 , one has @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the steady distribution of variable @xmath36 , and @xmath85 where the average @xmath39 is performed over the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the maximum in ( [ mu ] ) is attained by @xmath86 , according to the optimal strategy .",
    "let us stress that @xmath82 must be restricted to @xmath87 if the @xmath18 distribution is defined over all reals , to prevent that the logarithm argument in ( [ mu ] ) becomes negative .",
    "it is easy to show that for symmetric @xmath18 distributions the following expressions hold : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath90 the maximum is attained at @xmath91 , and one has : @xmath92 , which is independent on @xmath10 .    in a more general case , the result strictly depends on @xmath18 distribution . nevertheless , since in real financial data @xmath93 and @xmath47 are very small ( about @xmath58 for daily data , and much lower for intra - day data ) , it is reasonable to consider a taylor expansion in @xmath93 and @xmath47 up to second order .",
    "the optimal @xmath94 turns out to be @xmath95 and , according to this result , one has @xmath96    in fig . 2 numerical exact results of @xmath97 are plotted for a @xmath18 normal distribution and @xmath98 , compared with approximation ( [ lstar ] ) . in fig .",
    "3 the same comparison is performed for @xmath99 , plotting the numerical solution of ( [ mu ] ) and the approximation ( [ mustar ] ) .",
    "both graphs reveal the high quality of the approximated solution in a context where variables assume realistic financial values .",
    "equation ( [ lstar ] ) gives us a practical tool to construct an optimal trading strategy .",
    "taking into consideration realistic values for @xmath21 and @xmath47 , such as those found in sect .",
    "iii , one can realize that the @xmath36 interval with a non trivial @xmath100 is very small . as a consequence ,",
    "the optimal strategy ( [ lstar ] ) is _ de facto _ almost equivalent to the following more simple suboptimal strategy : invest all the capital ( @xmath101 ) whenever @xmath93 is positive , keep a neutral position ( @xmath102 ) otherwise .",
    "this simple trading strategy is applied to our three datasets , using for parameters @xmath21 , @xmath10 and @xmath47 the corresponding values found in sect .",
    "the resulting capital growth rates @xmath103 are compared with the intrinsic growth rates of crude data @xmath104 , which is obtained applying a buy and hold technique :    \\a ) nasdaq index : @xmath105 and @xmath106 ;    \\b ) mibtel index : @xmath107 and @xmath108 ;    \\c ) usd - dm exchange rate : @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    in the last case",
    ", we have used the parameters resulting from the fit in the range @xmath111 . for comparison with the previous two cases concerning indices , we have chosen to buy only dollars ( the asset ) against marks ( money ) , while the opposite operation is not admitted .",
    "the @xmath104 turns out to be negative since dollar devalued during 1998 .",
    "the complete strategy should also allow to buy marks against dollars .",
    "this strategy is about twice more successful than our , but it loses its analogy with the one we use in share markets .    in order to give further evidences of the good quality of the proposed strategy , we consider the logarithmic growth @xmath112 of a capital invested according to our strategy on the nasdaq index .",
    "this simple strategy widely overcomes the index itself , as shown in fig .",
    "4 where the logarithmic growth of the nasdaq index is also plotted for comparison . at the end of september 2000 , while the nasdaq index is less than 16 times its initial value , the capital is become about 115 times . in other terms",
    ", the applied strategy is able to forecast the next quote with a probability of success greater than @xmath113 .",
    "another main feature of our strategy is revealed in fig .",
    "4 , where the logarithmic scale allows to compare directly the relative fluctuations of the capital and of the nasdaq index .",
    "it is quite clear that the typical fluctuation of the capital is smaller than that of the nasdaq index . in particular , the impact of nasdaq crashes on the capital is smoothened out .    the above results clearly prove a certain degree of inefficiency in the markets under consideration , since there exists at least a deterministic procedure to make a sure profit on a long run .",
    "a very interesting question is to determine how much of this information , not integrated by markets , keeps available for speculators once transactions cost are taken into account . roughly speaking , we find a daily growth rate of about @xmath114 with the strategies involving indices where trading frequency is less than an operation per day .",
    "it follows that a capital of about ten thousands of dollars should produce profit in case of fixed transaction costs of the order of few dollars per trade .",
    "these conditions are quite realistic both in american and european markets .",
    "moving average plays an important role in price dynamics .",
    "future price is influenced by the current difference between logarithmic price and its moving average .",
    "this difference tends both to reduce and to enlarge , according to the examined market .",
    "the first open question is : this feature is a strict peculiarity of the market , or does it depends on the time frequency of data ? in our cases , both daily datasets exhibit a repulsive moving average , at difference with usd - dm high frequency dataset .",
    "the answer could be that at different time scales , different moving average effects are active , possibly attractive on short scales and repulsive on larger scales .",
    "the problem deserves further investigations .",
    "another interesting point is to investigate if the moving average action is generated by a self - organized mechanism of traders reactions @xcite . in other words , is it possible that traders , taking into account informations given by moving averages , make collectively induced financial choices producing , as a result , the observed phenomena ?    in our price dynamics model a random component is also present , which we do not have deeply investigated , being this out of the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , our picture could help to determine the exact shape of the noise , since , in principle , we are now able to filter the deterministic contribution .    finally , in the light of our model , we have found a trading strategy that widely overcomes the intrinsic performance of the examined datasets . in this way",
    ", we have given a clear evidence that some inefficiency is present in financial markets .",
    "next challenge is to find out if part of this inefficiency survives when applied by a real speculator , which lives in a real financial world , where transaction costs , unfortunately , are not omitted .",
