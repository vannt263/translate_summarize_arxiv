    "particulate flows involve a dynamically evolving fluid that interacts with solid suspended particles , and arise in a wide range of applications in natural and industrial processes @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the gravitational settling or sedimentation problem , in which the suspended solid particles have large enough mass that they settle under their own weight .",
    "sedimentation is observed in many applications , including flow of pollutants in rivers and the atmosphere , tea leaves settling to the bottom of a teacup , industrial crystal precipitation , mineral ore processing , and hail formation in thunderclouds , to name just a few .",
    "there is an extensive literature on experimental , theoretical and computational studies of particulate flows involving sedimentation .",
    "we make no attempt here to perform a comprehensive review , but will rather highlight a few of the more important results .",
    "experimental studies of sedimentation have had a long history including the earlier work of richardson and zaki  @xcite and extending to more recent years  @xcite .",
    "many analytical and approximate solutions have been developed to explain the behavior of settling suspensions , especially in the dilute limit where there are only a small number of particles . back in 1851 , stokes  @xcite derived an analytical solution for a single particle settling within an unbounded fluid , and many other authors have since extended these results to other more practical sedimentation problems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , many numerical approaches have been applied to simulate settling particles , including the finite element method @xcite , lattice - boltzmann method @xcite , and boundary element method @xcite .",
    "the underlying feature of these numerical methods is that the fluid flow is governed by the navier - stokes equations whereas the particles are governed by newton s equations of motion .",
    "the hydrodynamic forces between the particle and fluid are obtained from the solution of this coupled system , which typically requires either complex interfacial matching conditions at the fluid - particle interface , or else some form of dynamic boundary - fitted meshing . in any case , these methods tend to be complex and extremely cpu - intensive , especially for three - dimensional flows .",
    "one numerical approach that has proven to be especially effective for solving complex fluid - structure interaction problems involving dynamic moving structures is the _ immersed boundary _ ( or ib ) method .",
    "this approach has been used extensively to simulate deformable structures arising in problems in biofluid mechanics  @xcite .",
    "wang and layton  @xcite have recently used the ib method to simulate sedimentation of multiple rigid 1d fibers suspended in a viscous incompressible fluid , and several other authors have applied the the ib approach to solve related sedimentation problems  @xcite .    the ib method is a mixed eulerian - lagrangian approach , in which the fluid equations are solved on an equally - spaced rectangular mesh , while the moving solid boundaries are approximated at a set of points that moves relative to the underlying fluid grid . in the original ib method , the effect of these immersed boundaries is represented as a singular force that is computed from the ib configuration and which is then spread onto fluid grid points by means of a regularized delta function .",
    "the added mass due to a sedimenting particle can also be distributed onto the fluid in a similar manner . with the exception of the papers by wang and layton  @xcite and hopkins and fauci  @xcite ,",
    "the other authors mentioned above have employed a modification of this ib approach known as the `` direct forcing ib method , '' wherein the force is an artificial quantity that is calculated directly from the governing equations so as to satisfy the velocity boundary conditions exactly on the immersed boundary ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to apply the original ib method to solving sedimentation problems , rather than the direct forcing approach .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a two - dimensional geometry , in which one or two particles with a circular cross - section settle under the influence of gravity within a rectangular channel that has vertical bounding walls .",
    "although the ib approach has been applied to solve certain sedimentation problems , there has not yet been an extensive comparison to other results in the literature .",
    "our primary aim is therefore to perform such a comparison to a number of experimental  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite , and numerical  @xcite studies , in order to ascertain the validity of the ib approach in simulating sedimentation problems .",
    "although we focus here on solid particles , the long - term goal of our work is to develop a numerical framework that can be used to investigate the settling of highly deformable particles .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : ib - method ] by describing the ib method and defining the forces used to simulate the presence of both settling particles and channel walls .",
    "section  [ sec : vs - approx ] contains a review of previous analytical and experimental results on the settling velocity for a single particle in both unbounded and wall - bounded domains .",
    "we then perform a series of numerical simulations of sedimentation at small to moderate reynolds numbers , and report the results in sections  [ sec : num - one ] and [ sec : num - two ] .",
    "most of the results appearing in this article are contained in the phd thesis of the first author  @xcite .",
    "the immersed boundary method is both a mathematical formulation and a numerical scheme .",
    "we begin in this section by describing the model equations that underlie the ib formulation for fluid - structure interaction . following that , we discretize the equations and describe the numerical algorithm used to determine an approximate solution . finally , we provide details on the specification of the discrete ib force density representing the channel walls and sedimenting particles .      in this section",
    "we describe a two - dimensional ib model that is capable of capturing solid ( and potentially deformable ) elastic bodies with general shape and that move within a surrounding incompressible , newtonian fluid under the action of gravitational force .",
    "the details of the ib force density used to handle a solid circular object in the presence of two parallel bounding walls are left for section  [ sec : force - density ] .",
    "all variables and parameters in this paper are stated in cgs units , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "suppose that a moving elastic solid body @xmath0 is contained within a fluid domain @xmath1 as pictured in figure  [ fig : domain ] .",
    "consisting of several disconnected components immersed within a doubly - periodic fluid domain @xmath1 . ]    in general , @xmath0 may consist of several disconnected components , @xmath2 , where each @xmath3 can be a one - dimensional elastic membrane ( parameterized by a single real parameter @xmath4 ) or an elastic solid region ( whose specification requires two parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we denote the location or `` configuration '' of the immersed boundary by @xmath6 [ ] , where @xmath7 is a dimensionless ib parameterization that is used to represent either a scalar @xmath4 or a vector @xmath8 , depending on the context . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath9\\times[0,l_y]$ ] is rectangular in shape and that periodic boundary conditions are applied in both the @xmath10- and @xmath11-directions .    the effect of the elastic body on the fluid is to impose a force @xmath12 [ ] onto the adjacent fluid particle at location @xmath13 , which is incorporated into the incompressible navier - stokes equations as follows : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the fluid velocity [ ] , @xmath16 is the pressure [ ] , @xmath17 are the eulerian coordinates [ ] for the fluid domain @xmath1 , @xmath18 is density [ ] and @xmath19 is dynamic viscosity [ ] .",
    "the ib forcing term in the momentum equations ( [ eq : ns - mom ] ) is represented by a force density @xmath20 [ ] that is spread onto the surrounding fluid by means of a delta - function convolution @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cartesian product of two one - dimensional dirac delta functions .",
    "the consistency of the above equations with the dynamics of an actual incompressible elastic material interacting with an incompressible fluid is demonstrated under very general conditions in the review paper by peskin  @xcite .",
    "most papers in the immersed boundary literature assume that @xmath0 has the same constant density @xmath23 as the surrounding fluid , and hence @xmath0 is neutrally buoyant",
    ". however , for the particle sedimentation application considered here , we must take @xmath0 ( or at least portions of it ) to have density @xmath24 that is greater than that of the fluid .",
    "consequently , the density of the fluid - solid composite material @xmath25 is a variable quantity that may also be written in terms of a delta function convolution as  @xcite @xmath26 the quantity @xmath27  is the added lagrangian mass density due to @xmath0 , with @xmath28 only for those components that are neutrally buoyant .    in all examples in this paper",
    ", we will take @xmath29 ( constant ) , and we also assume that the solid density is close to that of the fluid so that @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to apply a boussinesq approximation as in  @xcite so that the extra intertial term involving @xmath31 is neglected and the density on the left hand side of the momentum equations ( [ eq : ns - mom ] ) is taken equal to the constant @xmath23 : @xmath32 the extra forcing term @xmath33 derives from the force of gravity acting on the immersed boundary and can be written as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath36 is the unit vector in the vertical direction .",
    "finally , the immersed boundary is assumed to move with the fluid so that @xmath37 which is simply the `` no - slip '' condition for fluid particles located adjacent to the immersed boundary .",
    "in summary , the governing equations consist of ( [ eq : ns - inc ] ) , ( [ eq : ns - mom2])([eq : ib - velocity ] ) , with the ib force density being the only component that remains to be specified .",
    "since it is easiest to write @xmath12 in discrete form , we will first derive the discretized governing equations , after which we will provide a specification for the ib force .",
    "the algorithm we describe next is a semi - implicit scheme that is closely related to the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "the fluid domain @xmath1 is divided into an equally - spaced grid of points denoted by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "we consider a time interval @xmath43 $ ] divided into equally - spaced points @xmath44 with time step @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we may then define discrete approximations of the velocity and pressure @xmath47 and @xmath48 at points @xmath49 .",
    "the immersed boundary @xmath0 is similarly discretized at points @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and the ib configuration and force density are approximated by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .    using the above notation",
    ", we introduce finite difference operators that approximate the spatial derivatives appearing in the governing equations .",
    "in particular , we define two one - sided difference approximations of the @xmath10derivative of a grid quantity @xmath54 @xmath55 as well as the centered approximation @xmath56 analogous definitions apply for the @xmath11derivative approximations @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the gradient is replaced by the centered approximation @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the delta function appearing in the integral terms is replaced by the regularized function @xmath61    we are now prepared to state the immersed boundary algorithm . in any given time step",
    ", we assume that values of the velocity @xmath62 and ib configuration @xmath63 are known from the previous step .",
    "these quantities are evolved to time @xmath64 using the following procedure :    1 .",
    "compute the ib force density @xmath65 based on the configuration @xmath66 as described in section  [ sec : force - density ] .",
    "2 .   spread the ib force to the fluid grid points using a discretization of the integral in ( [ eq : ib - force ] ) @xmath67 and a similar approximation of the integral in ( [ eq : gravity ] ) yields a formula for @xmath68 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath69 in both cases is inversely proportional to the number of ib points ( @xmath70 ) and has a different interpretation depending on whether the immersed boundary is a 1d fiber ( channel wall ) or a 2d solid block ( circular particle ) . in the case of a fiber @xmath69",
    "is a length , while for a solid region @xmath69 is an area ; in both cases , the factor @xmath69 ensures that the formula ( [ eq : ib - force2 ] ) scales properly with the number of ib points and that it is a consistent approximation of the corresponding integral .",
    "more details on the precise form of ( [ eq : ib - force2 ] ) and the specification of @xmath69 are provided in section  [ sec : force - density ] .",
    "3 .   integrate the incompressible navier - stokes equations using a split - step projection scheme : 1 .",
    "compute an intermediate velocity @xmath71 by applying the elastic and gravitational forces on the immersed boundary : @xmath72 2 .",
    "apply an adi discretization of the advection and diffusion terms : @xmath73 @xmath74 these equations represent a sequence of tridiagonal solves for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "3 .   project the intermediate velocity @xmath76 onto the space of divergence - free vector fields by : 1 .",
    "solving the pressure poisson equation @xmath77 note that @xmath78 represents a wide finite difference stencil for the laplacian involving the pressure values @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . owing to the periodic boundary conditions on @xmath1 , the resulting system of linear equations",
    "is solved most easily by means of the discrete fourier transform , which is calculated using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the discrete fourier transform fully decouples the system and reduces the solution to a single linear equation for each wave number in fourier space .",
    "the pressure variables may then be obtained by applying the inverse fft .",
    "details of this approach are described in @xcite .",
    "2 .   updating the velocity according to @xmath84 4 .",
    "evolve the immersed boundary using @xmath85    this simple semi - implicit time discretization described above introduces a cfl - like time - step restriction on the numerical scheme that depends on the reynolds number as well as the elastic ib force .",
    "the dependence of the stable time step on parameters can be characterized in certain idealized cases  @xcite , and these results can be used as a guide to selecting a value for @xmath86 , but in practical computations the time step must be determined manually .",
    "this algorithm yields a solution that is first - order accurate in time , and although all spatial derivatives are approximated using second - order finite differences , the method is also first - order accurate in space owing to errors in velocity interpolation near the immersed boundary that arise from the use of the regularized delta function .",
    "it is straightforward to increase the temporal accuracy to second order using an algorithm such as that proposed by lai and peskin  @xcite , but it is much more difficult to increase the spatial accuracy  @xcite . since the focus of the current study is to validate the general ib approach in the study of particle sedimentation , we have chosen to employ the simple scheme above , and leave for future work the implementation of higher order extensions to the algorithm .",
    "we begin by describing the geometry for the particle sedimentation problem .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig : channel ] , we take a rectangular fluid domain of size @xmath87 and place two vertical immersed fibers representing the channel walls a distance @xmath88 apart , symmetric relative to the channel centerline , and separated from the domain boundary by a narrow strip of fluid . with periodic boundary conditions applied on all sides of the domain , the channel walls naturally connect to each other across the top and bottom boundaries . a single , solid , circular particle of diameter @xmath89 is initially located at the center of the channel . later on",
    ", we will consider other initial configurations with one and two particles , but for now this will suffice to illustrate the calculation of the ib force density .",
    "this circular particle in 2d may be thought of as corresponding in 3d to a cross - section of a solid cylinder with infinite length .    .",
    "the first test case has a single solid particle of diameter @xmath89 that is released at time @xmath90 along the channel centerline ( which is indicated by a dotted line ) . ]    in our sedimentation model , the ib force density @xmath91 is the sum of two terms , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 represents the force density generated by the channel walls and @xmath94 is that generated by the circular particle .",
    "these forces are discussed separately in the next two sections .",
    "the vertical walls are discretized using an equally - spaced array of ib points that are initially at locations @xmath95 for the left wall , and @xmath96 for the right wall , where the wall point spacing is @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "each ib point is connected to a fixed `` tether point '' ( at the same initial location ) by a very stiff spring that exerts a force of the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 [ ] is the spring stiffness and @xmath50 is the moving ib point location .",
    "any motion of the ib point away from corresponding the tether point location generates a spring force that drives it back towards the target , so that as long as @xmath100 is chosen large enough the wall points can be made to mimic a rigid structure .",
    "we emphasize that tether points neither move with the fluid nor generate any force themselves .",
    "a similar expression is developed for the force density at the right wall points , @xmath101 so that the total wall force density may be written as @xmath102 the natural choice of scaling factor in the force spreading step ( [ eq : ib - force2 ] ) is the wall point spacing , @xmath103 .",
    "the circular particle is represented by a collection of @xmath104 lagrangian points that lie on its circumference and throughout its interior .",
    "we make use of the unstructured triangular mesh generator distmesh  @xcite that generates a nearly uniform triangulation such as that shown in figure  [ fig : dist_mesh ] .",
    "the nodes of the triangulation are the ib points @xmath50 , for @xmath105 , while the edges of the triangles define a network of springs that maintains the shape of the particle .",
    "in addition to bearing ib spring forces , the network nodes are also employed in equation ( [ eq : gravity ] ) to distribute added mass throughout the particle .        in practice",
    ", we generate the triangulation by calling the matlab function distmesh2d with the `` scaled edge length function '' huniform ( a function provided by the authors that attempts to find a mesh that is as uniform as possible ) .",
    "we also set the `` initial edge length '' parameter equal to @xmath106 , which ensures that the mesh obeys @xmath107 which is a standard `` rule of thumb '' that avoids leakage of fluid between ib points  @xcite .",
    "this form of particle discretization should be compared with the more common ib approach that uses an open circular ring of points with a freely - moving fluid inside , such as in  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been criticised  @xcite for generating non - physical fluid motions inside the particle and in some cases leading to significant deviations in the shape of the particle .",
    "in contrast , our discretization of the particle interior with a network of ib springs suppresses this spurious fluid motion and also helps to maintain the rigidity of the particle boundary .",
    "we now define the spring forces that act on the network , following the development of alpkvist and klapper for viscoelastic biofilm structures  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath108 be the vector joining two ib points labeled @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and let @xmath111 be the corresponding distance .",
    "we assume that the spring network is initially in equilibrium ( i.e. , zero force ) so that all springs have a resting length equal to their initial length , @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be an incidence matrix whose entries @xmath114 are either 1 or 0 depending on whether or not points @xmath109 and @xmath110 are connected , respectively .",
    "then the force density acting on the @xmath115 ib point in the network is @xmath116 where the sum is taken only over those @xmath110 for which @xmath117 is connected to @xmath50 in the network .",
    "we have also assumed that the spring stiffness @xmath118 [ ] is constant for all network connections . the total elastic force density generated by all ib points making up the circular particle",
    "is then given by @xmath119 the appropriate scaling factor for the force integral ( [ eq : ib - force2 ] ) is the average area of a triangular mesh cell , @xmath120 .",
    "a similar approach was employed by hopkins and fauci  @xcite to simulate a suspension of microbial cells that they treated as point particles .",
    "we next review some of the existing analytical and experimental results on the settling of a single particle falling under the action of gravity .",
    "the study of a spherical particle in an unbounded fluid medium in 3d is a classical problem that was considered by stokes  @xcite , who obtained a formula for the settling velocity that is now known as stokes law .",
    "we will first state stokes result and then modify it for a circular particle in 2d , which corresponds to an idealized `` infinite cylinder '' in 3d .",
    "we then consider the case of a circular particle falling in a bounded fluid domain between two vertical walls and then review several of the most commonly - used formulas for the `` wall - correction factors '' that have been obtained from either fitting to experimental data or using approximate analytical techniques . a fairly extensive overview of settling for cylindrical particles , including many of the wall correction formulas reported in the literature , is given by champmartin and ambari  @xcite .",
    "there are two main forces acting upon a massive particle settling in a fluid : the gravitational force @xmath121 , and the drag force @xmath122 due to the `` friction '' between the particle and the fluid .",
    "a particle that is initially at rest will accelerate under the action of gravity , and as the particle begins to move through the fluid it experiences a drag force in the direction opposite to its motion that increases with the speed of the particle relative to the fluid . if the drag force becomes large enough that it equals the gravitational force ,",
    "then the two forces are in balance and no further acceleration occurs .",
    "the particle velocity in this equilibrium state is known as the settling or terminal velocity .",
    "we take a sphere of diameter @xmath89 and density @xmath123 whose added mass relative to the fluid is @xmath124 .",
    "the net gravitational force acting on the sphere is @xmath125 and the corresponding drag force is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the drag coefficient for a sphere and @xmath128 is the velocity of the sphere relative to the fluid .",
    "the settling velocity @xmath129 corresponds to the long - term steady state in which drag and gravity forces are in balance , so that @xmath130 . by equating ( [ sphereg ] ) and ( [ spheredrag ] )",
    ", we can solve for @xmath131 keeping in mind that the drag coefficient on the right hand side also typically depends on the settling velocity , @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , we know from @xcite that the drag coefficient for a sphere can be approximated for small reynolds number by @xmath132 where we have taken @xmath133 based on the particle diameter . substituting this expression into ( [ terminal_sphere ] ) and solving for @xmath129 we obtain stokes law @xmath134 which is valid for @xmath135 .      a similar argument",
    "may be used to derive the corresponding expression for a circular particle in 2d .",
    "we begin by considering a cylinder with diameter @xmath89 and length @xmath109 and take the limit as @xmath136 in order to obtain a result that is relevant to our 2d geometry .",
    "the immersed cylinder has an added mass ( relative to the fluid ) of @xmath137 for which the net gravitational force is @xmath138 and the drag force is @xmath139 notice that the cross - sectional area factor @xmath140 for the sphere from ( [ spheredrag ] ) is replaced by @xmath141 for the cylinder , and the tildes are used here to denote cylindrical quantities .",
    "we also make use of the drag coefficient for a cylinder from @xcite @xmath142 which holds when @xmath143 .    the settling velocity for the cylinder is then obtained by equating the gravitational and drag forces in ( [ fg ] ) and ( [ fd ] ) , which yields @xmath144 observe that the factor of length @xmath109 cancels in the above expression , so that this same expression is valid also for the 2d geometry in the @xmath136 limit .",
    "furthermore , this expression is the same as that for the sphere in ( [ terminal_sphere ] ) except that the factor @xmath145 is replaced here with @xmath146 , and of course the cylinder drag coefficient is also different .",
    "when equations ( [ drag_cylinder])([classical_cylinder ] ) are taken together , they reduce to a nonlinear equation in @xmath147 @xmath148 which can alternatively be written as an equation in @xmath149 . it is easy to show that the function @xmath150 is continuous on the interval @xmath151 and has the following properties : @xmath152 therefore , @xmath153 is guaranteed to have a unique positive real root by the intermediate value theorem .",

    "we repeated the previous calculation by increasing the reynolds number to @xmath178 and our results are pictured in figures  [ hori_dist ] and  [ symm_snap ] which exhibit similar dynamics to the lower @xmath147 case .     and @xmath178.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in particular , we still observe no transition to phase iii behavior even at this higher reynolds number .",
    "these results give us some confidence that our ib simulations are reproducing physically - relevant behavior corresponding to phases i and ii , but a more detailed numerical study is required in order to determine the source of the discrepancy between our method and fhj s approach .",
    "the perfectly symmetric initial conditions used above are somewhat artificial , and will never actually occur in a real flow .",
    "hence , we have also simulated an asymmetric initial placement of the particles given by @xmath179 in which the initial particle locations from ( [ eq : horiz_symmetric ] ) are shifted a distance @xmath180 to the left as pictured in figure  [ fig : init_profile](d ) . otherwise , the channel width @xmath167 and reynolds number @xmath178 remain the same as in the symmetric case .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figures  [ hori_dist ] and  [ asymm_snap ] , where the particles exhibit similar dynamics to the symmetric case and approach the same long - term equilibrium solution .",
    "the only difference can be seen in the transient motion where the particles undergo one additional oscillation in the horizontal locations en  route to steady state .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of the immersed boundary method to simulate realistic dynamics of solid particles settling under gravity within a newtonian incompressible fluid .",
    "the solid particles are modelled as a network of stiff springs , while the added mass of the particles is incorporated using an extra gravitational forcing term that is spread onto fluid points via a regularized delta function .",
    "numerical simulations of a single particle show good agreement with the most accurate empirical formula for wall - corrected settling velocity due to faxn .",
    "furthermore , two - particle simulations reproduce qualitatively features of the dynamics seen in both experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "this study is by no means a comprehensive comparison to other results from the extensive literature on particle sedimentation , but rather sets the stage for such a study in future . in particular",
    ", we plan to perform a more detailed comparison with other published results , focusing first on our idealized cylindrical particles . by implementing improvements to the numerical algorithm that increase accuracy of the solution approximation ( such as in  @xcite )",
    "we hope to be able to explain the discrepancy we observed between our results and those of feng , hu and joseph  @xcite .",
    "after that , the natural next step would be to extend our numerical method to 3d in order to permit simulations spherical particle interactions in a more realistic geometry .",
    "we emphasize that this study is a `` proof - of - concept '' that the immersed boundary method may be applied to simulating the sedimentation of particles that are denser than the suspending fluid .",
    "we make no claim to improve on or to compete with other numerical methods that are specially - tailored to deal with rigid , non - deformable particles .",
    "instead , our ultimate goal is to solve sedimentation problems involving irregularly - shaped and highly deformable particles , which to our knowledge has not been sufficiently well studied in the literature .",
    "such particle systems arise in the study of suspensions of red blood cells , wood pulp fibers , vesicles , bubbles , etc . making use of the uniform",
    "triangulated meshes from the distmesh package will allow us to deal with more general particle shapes .",
    "furthermore , we plan to take advantage of recent developments in massively parallel immersed boundary algorithms by wiens and stockie  @xcite , which should prove instrumental in allowing efficient 2d and 3d immersed boundary simulations to be performed for non - dilute suspensions containing large numbers of particles .",
