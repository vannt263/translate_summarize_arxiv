    "the third is the present tiny vacuum energy  observed by the supernova cosmology project @xcite . among these",

    "one example is the chaotic inflation that the vacuum energy at the time of inflation is huge during 60 or more e - folding time@xcite .",
    "the third one is also understood by particle physics models under the name of quintessence@xcite .    at present , understanding the cosmological constant(c.c . )",
    "problem is the most difficult and unsolved problem .",
    "it is a fine - tuning problem in four - dimensional(4d ) space - time . in 4d , in order to have the flat space the cosmological constant @xmath3 must be exactly zero , otherwise the space is curved . in higher dimensional space - time , this problem has another twist .",
    "the reason is that we require only the effective 4d space - time is flat after integrating out the extra space , even though the bulk is curved with a warp factor .",
    "thus , with extra spaces there is more freedom .",
    "indeed , the brane models _ a la _ randall and sundrum(rs ) give some hope toward understanding this problem .",
    "the recent self - tuning solutions of the cosmological constant problem are worked out in the rs type models in five dimensions(5d)@xcite .",
    "these self - tuning solutions are distinguished by the _ weak self - tuning solution _ and the _ strong self - tuning solution_@xcite .",
    "the weak self - tuning solution requires just the existence of a 4d flat space solution consistent with the imposed boundary conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong self - tuning solution requires that the _ 4d flat space solution is the only solution _ consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "so far , there does not exist a strong self - tuning solution@xcite .",
    "but , there are examples of the weak self - tuning solutions : with antisymmetric tensor field @xmath4 @xcite in rs - ii type models@xcite and with the addition@xcite of the gauss - bonnet term@xcite .",
    "the needed inflation in the brane world scenario is to obtain a de sitter space solution at @xmath5 and transform it into a flat space solution at @xmath6 when the standard big bang cosmology commences .",
    "the study of time dependence is needed .    with the existing weak self - tuning solution",
    ", we studied the time dependence of a flat space at @xmath5 to a flat space at @xmath7 as the brane tension @xmath8 , located at @xmath9 , changes@xcite .",
    "it will be possible to study the time dependence of a transition from a de sitter space solution at @xmath5 to a flat space solution at @xmath7 , with weak self - tuning solution . at present",
    "we have not obtained a closed form de sitter space solution with the weak self - tuning solution , and hence can not study this kind of time dependence explicitly .",
    "but , it has been possible to study the time dependence of a flat space at @xmath5 to a flat space at @xmath7 since we obtained closed form flat space solutions@xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that it is not a trivial problem to introduce inflation with the self - tuning solutions .    in this paper , we consider inflation with the known closed form weak self - tuning solution@xcite . in this kim - kyae - lee(kkl ) model , the flat solutions with a finite planck mass is possible in a finite range of brane tension @xmath8 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ads bulk c.c . , and we set the 5d fundamental mass @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , one anticipates that the flat solutions are not possible at @xmath13 where however de sitter space solutions may be possible .",
    "if so , a sufficient inflation is possible in the de sitter space .",
    "then , by letting the brane tension @xmath8 fall in the range of eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , one can terminate the inflation and reaches a flat space .",
    "one such example is the hybrid inflation@xcite at the brane .    0.3 cm    fig .  1 .  _",

    "the flat space is obtained . in our self - tuning solutions@xcite ,",
    "the flat spaces are possible in a finite range of 5d parameters , as shown in ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "this can be viewed as a blowing - up of the one point , as shown in fig .",
    "one notable feature is that the kkl model does not allow flat space solutions outside the range given in ( [ bound ] ) , namely the inflation can be naturally introduced in the range of parameters , @xmath14 .",

    "there are weak self - tuning solutions in 5d @xcite . among these",

    ". let us consider the nearby solutions for the flat , de sitter(ds ) , and anti de sitter(ads ) spaces . in this case",
    ", three solutions will be almost identical up to the point @xmath67 so that the flat solution tail is negligible .",
    "the ds space solution has the horizon(the point where @xmath68 ) at @xmath69 . also , the ads space solution has the first cycle(up to the point where @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) extending almost to @xmath72 .",
    "the three cases of these nearby solutions are depicted in fig .",
    "since the ads solution can be discussed similarly as for the ds case , we compare below the flat and ds solutions only .",

    "the numerical values of @xmath73 are almost the same .",

    "the boundary condition at b1 , ( [ bctilde ] ) , should be the same for the flat and ds solutions since we look for solutions with the same @xmath8 .",
    "thus , if both flat and ds solutions exist , we have an equality , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the infinitesimal curvature @xmath76 near the flat solution , and subscripts f and ds denote the respective values in the flat and ds space solutions .",
    "we can choose the integration constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , satisfying the boundary condition ( [ fds ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that there exists a nearby ds space solution close to the flat space solution , which means that in the band for the flat solutions ( [ range ] ) there exist de sitter space solutions .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for ads solutions .",
    "therefore , in the region where flat space solutions are allowed , the ds and ads solutions are also allowed .",
    "it was shown previously that these ds and ads solutions exist by studying the behavior of @xmath79 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ tildeprime ] ) as , @xmath81 where @xmath82 we know that ds space solutions are possible if @xmath83 are satisfied@xcite .",
    "note that the discontinuity condition of the derivative of @xmath84 at @xmath9 is @xmath85 thus , in the region where flat space solutions are forbidden , we obtain an inequality , @xmath86 which is @xmath87 or the effective 4d curvature @xmath88 is bounded as @xmath89 where we recovered @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the region @xmath13 both flat and ads solutions are forbidden . _",
    "only ds solutions are allowed with the curvature bounded from below . _",
    "note that the de sitter space solution is obtained for the negative tension also , @xmath91 . in this case , the 4d gravity at the brane is antigravity and one must be careful in studying cosmological effects at the negative tension brane@xcite .    to estimate the order of the magnitude ,",
    "let us observe that the flat space solution ( [ solution ] ) shows that @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we guess that a rough inequality is @xmath94 , or @xmath95",

    "( [ range ] ) . in the previous section , in this region of @xmath8",
    "it was shown that the ds space solution is the only possibility .",
    "also , the conventional 4d einstein equations are obtained at the positive tension brane@xcite .",
    "this positive tension 3-brane is called b1 .",
    "now we can treat @xmath8 as the vacuum energy at b1 .",
    "namely , @xmath8 here is the vacuum energy of the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "therefore , the field evolution at b1 can be studied as in the usual 4d cosmology .",
    "any reasonable inflation model can be adopted to transform the ds - only region to the region given in ( [ range ] ) .",
    "probably , the most modern and attractive inflationary model is the _ hybrid inflation_@xcite which we adopt here for the purpose of lucid presentation . in the hybrid inflation ,",
    "at least two fields participate in the inflationary period .",
    "one field @xmath97(the inflaton field ) is responsible for keeping the potential flat during enough e - foldings and another field @xmath98(the waterfall field ) is responsible for exiting the inflationary period by radiating light particles .",
    "below we discuss cosmology at brane b1 .",
    "since it is sufficient to present our idea with the simplest original model of hybrid inflation@xcite , we adopt this model in this paper .",
    "the coupled potential of the inflaton and waterfall fields is assumed as @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and we treat @xmath101 and @xmath102 as large and small parameters , respectively . studying the effective mass of the waterfall field @xmath98 , we can see immediately that @xmath98 sits at @xmath103 if the inflaton field @xmath97 is greater than the critical value @xmath104 , region during the inflationary period . ]",
    "@xmath105 if @xmath97 moves below the critical value , the waterfall field @xmath98 feels the tachionic potential and rolls down to the minimum at @xmath106 .",
    "it was shown that the time needed to roll down the hill after @xmath97 passes @xmath104 is of order one hubble time@xcite . in the region",
    "@xmath107 , the inflaton potential looks like @xmath108 , and for a small value of @xmath102 a sufficient inflation is possible .",
    "one can take @xmath109  tev .    during the inflationary period ,",
    "the height of the potential is of order @xmath110    during the inflation , we require an almost flat potential , implying @xmath111 .",
    "namely , we require that @xmath101 is a large parameter and @xmath102 is a small parameter . at the time when @xmath97 reaches @xmath104 , the hubble parameter becomes @xmath112 requiring @xmath113 smaller than the hubble parameter , @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 with this condition a sufficient inflation is guaranteed .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that even a value of @xmath116 does not ruin the needed inflation@xcite .",
    "the condition of forbidding the flat space solution , namely the condition for inflation , is @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the integral in the definition of @xmath120 in eqs .",
    "( [ planckm ] ) and ( [ planckmd ] ) @xmath121 @xmath122 of the flat space solution is estimated as @xmath123 if we consider the parameters in the range , @xmath124,$ ] then @xmath125 falls in the range @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "thus , the inflation condition becomes @xmath127.\\ ] ] as an eyeball number , let us take @xmath128 then @xmath129 from eq .",
    "( [ rough ] ) , we can estimate the allowed vacuum energy @xmath130 which must be bounded , @xmath131 since we take @xmath132  gev ( note that @xmath133 . ) , it is consistent with the above condition for the de sitter space curvature @xmath88 in the de - sitter - space - only region .",
    "thus , there is a reasonable range of parameters satisfying the inflationary condition .    after a sufficient inflation in the effective 4d cosmology , the brane tension at b1 changes when the brane field inflaton @xmath97 becomes smaller than the critical value @xmath104 . within an order of the hubble time at @xmath134 , the brane vacuum energy or",
    "the brane tension @xmath8 falls in the range of eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) which allows flat space solution . within this range , however , not only the flat solutions but also curved solutions are possible",
    ". if the ds space solution is chosen , a further inflation would result . on the other hand , if a flat space solution is chosen , we exit from inflation and go into the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "the most probable case is that a flat space is chosen and inflation ends as in the standard hybrid inflation scenario in the flat space background .",
    "the question is how the flat space solution is chosen after @xmath8 falls in the range given in eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) .",
    "in fig . 1 , we sketched the parameter change from point d to point f. point d allows only the de sitter space and inflation is achieved without any difficulty .",
    "however , in the kkl model point f allows flat , de sitter and anti de sitter space solutions .",
    "only when a flat space is chosen , we obtain the vanishing cosmological constant . in this regard , obtaining a strong self - tuning solution with a blowing - up mode is of utmost importance . with a strong self - tuning solution ,",
    "then point f allows only flat space solutions and we arrive at the zero cosmological constant vacuum after exiting from the inflationary phase .    with the weak self - tuning solution",
    "as discussed in this paper , we must rely on an additional principle to choose flat space solutions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hawking s probabilistic selection@xcite was used . with the present form of hybrid inflation",
    ", this probabilistic choice can be more elegantly phrased .",
    "the initial condition for the universe is the state d in fig .",
    "1(b ) . with this initial condition ,",
    "it is unavoidable to have an inflationary period . when the inflaton field @xmath97 passes the point @xmath104 , the parameter set is given such that the band of eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) is chosen .",
    "now there are infinite ways to choose classical pathes , starting from point d and ending at point f. the probability to end at d with a flat solution is infinitely larger than the probability to end with ds or ads solutions .",
    "it is most probable that flat space solutions are chosen as soon as the path enters in the band of eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) . hawking s",
    "argument@xcite can be repeated in this situation .",
    "the euclidian space integral involves @xmath135 where @xmath136 represent the relevant vacuum energy .",
    "this integral is maximum where a flat space is chosen at every point of @xmath17 , which means that as soon as the bound ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied a flat space is chosen and continues to be so .",
    "the flat space obtained in this way corresponds to the field values where equations of motion are satisfied , presumably at the minimum of the potential .",
    "the above argument is notably qualitative .",
    "one can question , @xmath1what is the dominant sourse for ending the inflation ?",
    "\" we can say qualitatively that it is the waterfall field in the flat background . it will be interesting to see more accurately how the inflation terminates .",
    "thus , the present tiny vacuum energy above the point of a true minimum in the flat background will show up after the matter energy becomes comparable to dark energy .",
    "eventually , the universe feels the hill of this tiny tiny potential and will give the vanishing cosmological constant as soon as this tiny hill provides an oscillation and this oscillating mode behaves like cold dark matter .",
    "we introduced a reasonable scenario for a _",
    "sufficient inflation _ and transition to a vacuum with the _ vanishing cosmological constant _ in rs - ii type models . here",
    ", the observable sector fields are located at the brane b1 .",
    "the necessary ingredient is the de - sitter - space - only region in a blowing - up solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "we discussed the scheme with a previously found blowing - up solution in the form of weak self - tuning solution@xcite .",
    "this idea can be applied to any blowing - up solution of the cosmological constant problem with a de - sitter - space - only region .",
    "inflation is unavoidable for some initial conditions of the universe due to the existence of de - sitter - space - only region .",
    "fine - tuning is avoided because the flat space solutions are allowed in a finite range of parameter @xmath8 .",
    "exit from inflation can be realized in any reasonable inflationary model . in particular",
    ", we showed that it is possible to introduce a hybrid inflation , being consistent with the blowing - up region of the model we discussed .",
    "since the example we choose for the blowing - up solution is a weak self - tuning solution , we must rely on another principle to choose the flat space after inflation .",
    "for this we adopted hawking s probabilistic argument .",
