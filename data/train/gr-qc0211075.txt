    "the inspiral of binary compact objects is one of the main targets of the ground - based , interferometric gravitational - wave detectors currently coming online ( ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite and tama @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the most effective way of extracting such signals from the intrinsic noise of the detectors is to use _ matched - filtering _",
    "techniques @xcite , which involves the correlation of detector output with a family of templates thought to represent the expected signals .",
    "it is clear that the success of such searches critically depends on the accuracy of the adopted template families .",
    "a great effort has been devoted to the computation of compact object inspiral waveforms , especially using various pn - expansions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the current searches in ligo , geo600 and tama , are performed using the template family corresponding to two , non - spinning , point masses , including 2.5-pn order corrections . however , in some cases , expected signals are believed to deviate significantly from these waveforms . for the case of massive compact binaries ( total mass in excess of @xmath1m@xmath3 ) , it has been shown that the pn approximations break down right in the frequency band of the interferometric detectors @xcite .",
    "in fact the exact signal is unknown and a number of different approximations have been suggested as alternatives .",
    "recently , a family of templates that exhibits good overlap with the results obtained using all the various expansion approximations has been suggested for use in future searches ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another case where the current template family does not reflect realistic signals is the case of _ precessing _ binaries .",
    "compact objects with spins of significant magnitude and misalignment relative to the orbital angular momentum axis emit inspiral signals that are mainly modified by precession of the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "this precession is caused by high - order spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings .",
    "depending on the physical properties of the binary , a significant number of precession cycles occur within the frequency band of current ground - based interferometers .",
    "the resulting change in the polarization of the wave leads to modulations of both the amplitude and the phase of the inspiral signal . in principle",
    ", one would like to build a family of precessing inspiral templates .",
    "however , this is unrealistic because of computational limitations : precessing waveforms depend on extra parameters ( spin magnitudes and orientations ) and make the dimension of template parameter space prohibitively large .",
    "the first investigations of the importance of precession @xcite were further expanded in a consistent way @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) to account for the current ligo noise curve and all possible physical configurations of intermediate - mass @xmath6 systems .",
    "it is now understood that ignoring precession in the templates could risk the anticipated inspiral detection , since the detection rate can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude in the worst cases .",
    "the need for a family of `` mimic '' templates that can capture the signal modifications without unreasonably expanding the dimensionality of the templates is clear . early on @xcite",
    "suggested such a family that depends on only 3 additional parameters . in paper",
    "i we tested it extensively and found that this family alone did not improve the detection rate significantly ( improvement factors remained lower than 2 regardless of spin properties and masses ) .    our motivation for this paper is to pursue the issue of `` mimic '' precession templates further . throughout this work",
    "the methods and notations are the same as in paper i. the precessing signals are obtained using the simple - precession formalism @xcite , where only the most massive object carries a spin ( see the introduction of paper i for a justification ) . in this regime ,",
    "the effect of precession is described by both a phase and an amplitude modulation , so that , in the frequency domain , the signal is given by [ e : signal ] _",
    "prec(f ) = am _ no prec(f ) . in eq .",
    "( [ e : signal ] ) , @xmath7 denotes the signal with the same physical parameters ( masses , orientations ... ) but without precession .",
    "@xmath8 is an amplitude modulation ( eq . (",
    "11 ) of @xcite ) and @xmath9 is a phase modulation ( eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "we will neglect the thomas precession ( eq .",
    "( 14 ) of @xcite ) , assuming that the monotonic modulation induced by it will not greatly influence the results .",
    "this assumption should be checked by future work . except when otherwise stated ,",
    "the _ non - precessing _ parts of the templates and the signal , @xmath7 , are newtonian .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption that makes our calculations feasible , given our current computational resources .",
    "we have already shown in paper i that this assumption does not affect our results and conclusion in any quantitative way .    in this paper",
    "we have again included some indicative runs ( of high computational cost ) to show that the assumption of newtonian _ non - precessing _ parts of the templates and the signal ( as long as the two are consistent with each other ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) is not in any way limiting .",
    "we adopt a noise curve relevant to the initial ligo . the efficiency of a family of templates is quantified by the concept of the _ fitting factor _ ( ff ) @xcite , which describes the loss in signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) due to the mismatch between the signal and the templates :  ( ) =  ( ) _ where @xmath10 is the snr that would be achieved if the family of templates included the signal ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "most of the results will be presented by plotting the quantity @xmath11 , the factor by which the detection rate is reduced , assuming a uniform distribution of sources in volume and using the fitting factor averaged over all random angles in the problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[s : new_family ] , we first provide a physical explanation for why the apostolatos `` mimic '' template family is insufficient , in the context of an example case analyzed in detail .",
    "motivated by the results in the first part , we introduce a new family of templates , and show how they can improve the snr of detections .",
    "after briefly reviewing the determination of various computational parameters , we present our comprehensive results for two cases of high precession ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 in m@xmath3 ) .",
    "conclusions , perspectives , and future work are discussed in sec .  [",
    "s : conclu ] .",
    "the apostolatos `` mimic '' templates consist of non - precessing waveforms modulated in phase by the following oscillatory mathematical form : [ e : apost ] ^cor = c (b f^-2/3 + ) in the simple precession regime @xcite , both the spin @xmath14 and the orbital momentum @xmath15 precess around the total angular momentum @xmath16 , which remains at an approximately constant direction .",
    "analytical , approximate formulae ( eqs .",
    "( 29 ) of @xcite ) of the precession angle ( i.e. the angle describing the position of @xmath15 along its precession cone ) , as a function of frequency , have been derived .",
    "it has been argued that the modulation of the inspiral phase induced by precession would have essentially the same behavior with respect to frequency , hence the form ( [ e : apost ] ) .",
    "there was also an expectation that any monotonic modulation of the phase would be indirectly accounted for by a mismatch of the non - precessing parameters ( e.g. , masses ) with respect to the real values responsible for the signal . in paper i",
    "we have shown that this oscillatory modulation alone can not recover a high snr ( we have also shown that this conclusion does not depend on the choice of the power index for the dependence of the precession angle on frequency ) . as a first step in the search for a more efficient family of templates ,",
    "it is useful to try and understand in some more detail the behavior of the apostolatos phase correction .    before showing some particular examples ,",
    "let us note some important points .",
    "first of all , one of the effects of simple precession is an additive phase modification of the non - precession phase : [ e : phimod ] _",
    "s = _ no prec + _ mod where @xmath17 is the total phase of the signal , @xmath18 the phase without precession , and @xmath19 the _ phase modulation_. the expression proposed by apostolatos ( [ e : apost ] ) was intended to `` mimic '' the true @xmath19 .",
    "however we will see that this is not always the case .",
    "another complication comes from the fact that @xmath19 is not the phase that one would like to `` mimic '' to obtain high snrs , at least not in the framework proposed by @xcite and tested in paper i. indeed , in these studies , searches are performed in two consecutive steps .",
    "first , one uses only the ( post)-newtonian templates without any precession modification .",
    "let us call @xmath20 the newtonian template for which the maximum @xmath21 is obtained , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the parameters of this template ( the dependence on @xmath24 is analytical but its value can be determined , mainly for plotting purposes ) . because of the modulations of the signal induced by precession , the parameters of @xmath20 do not match exactly the ones of the signal .",
    "based on the expectation that the parameters of the newtonian templates do not correlate with those of the phase correction ( [ e : apost ] ) , the maximization over the parameters of this correction is performed after @xmath20 is identified .",
    "however , because of the mismatch of the parameters , the phase difference between @xmath20 and the signal @xmath25 is not the phase modulation @xmath19 .",
    "instead it is equal to what we will call the _ residual _ phase : [ e : phires ] = _ s - _ t_max , where @xmath17 is the phase of the signal and @xmath26 the phase of @xmath20 . in a 2-step search scheme ( first newtonian",
    "then `` mimic '' templates ) , the `` mimic '' templates must represent a good fit to the residual phase defined above . it turns out that the residual phase @xmath27 and the phase correction ( [ e : apost ] ) can have very different behaviors so that this effect of the mismatch is rather crucial .    in what follows",
    "we consider two opposite examples of precession signals and their behaviors . in both cases",
    "the values of the masses are @xmath28m@xmath3 and @xmath29m@xmath3 , the spin magnitude of the most massive compact object is maximum ( @xmath30 ) , and the cosine of the spin - tilt angle ( relative to the orbital angular momentum axis ) is @xmath31 .",
    "depending on the values of the random angles that determine the orientation of the orbital plane ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , the sky position ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , and the constant phase present in the expression for the precession angle ( cf .",
    "( 63a ) of @xcite ) ( @xmath36 ) , the behavior of the phase modulation @xmath19 ( eq .",
    "( [ e : phimod ] ) ) can be very different .",
    "one of the two examples ( configuration i ) produces a monotonic modulation whereas the other ( ii ) produces mainly an oscillation .",
    "the exact values of the random angles , for both configurations are given in table [ t : config ] .",
    ".[t : config ] values of the random angles for the two configurations shown respectively in fig .",
    "[ f : mono ] and [ f : oscille ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in figure [ f : spikes_10_14 ] we show the efficiency of the `` spiky '' templates for @xmath37m@xmath3 , @xmath29m@xmath3 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the left panel shows the average @xmath38 as a function of the cosine of the misalignment angle @xmath39 and the right panel the reduction factor in detection rate @xmath40 , assuming a uniform volume distribution of sources .",
    "it is evident that the new family of template can greatly improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "values of @xmath38 are above 0.8 for the full range of spin - misalignment angles .",
    "consequently the reduction factors of detection rate increase by factors of up to 5 - 6 ( compared to cases where precession is ignored ; see paper i ) or in other words the detection rate is never reduced by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is to be compared with the curves showing the newtonian and apostolatos templates for which the detection rate can be reduced by as much as 10 and 5 ( respectively ) .",
    "the triangles are computed by including 2pn corrections to the phases of the non - precessing parts of _ both _ the signal and the templates . as already stated in sec .",
    "[ ss : procedure ] , the results are almost the same as the ones obtained by using only newtonian expressions .",
    "it is a clear validation of our results , as it illustrates the fact , already observed in paper i , that the order of the non - precessing part is not important , as long as the order of the non - precessing parts is kept consistent between the signal and the templates .",

    "figure [ f : histo ] shows the associated histogram , i.e. the number of configurations for which a given @xmath21 is obtained .",

    "[ ss : procedure ] , fft techniques can also be used to compute the @xmath38 during the first step of our procedure ( post - newtonian search ) .",
    "although such algorithms have not been used for obtaining the plots shown in this paper , we conducted a few tests to check the validity of our results .",
    "as expected , we found that the agreement between the two methods is almost perfect .",
    "indeed , it is better than a fraction of @xmath51 for reasonable number of points used to compute the fft .",
    "the goal of this paper has been to find a new family of templates for the efficient detection of precessing binary inspiral .",
    "we are motivated by a careful study of the qualitative behavior of the residual phase once the signal has been matched with a best - fitting non - precessing template .",
    "this initial study provides with an explanation for the insufficiency of the purely oscillatory phase correction shown in eq .",
    "( [ e : apost ] ) , suggested for the first time by apostolatos @xcite .",
    "the problem seems to be that the mismatch between the non - precessing parameters of the signal and the templates fails to remove all the monotonic behavior of the phase modulation ( cf .",
    "[ f : mono ] ) . in some other cases ,",
    "the mismatch can even `` pollute '' the phase modulation and becomes responsible for the appearance of a monotonic component ( cf .",
    "[ f : oscille ] ) .    to tackle this problem ,",
    "we have shown that the monotonic behavior of the phase can be represented by a succession of spike - like structures .",
    "these spikes can be searched very efficiently by using a hierarchical algorithm , in which the spikes are found one after the other until the @xmath21 converges .",
    "we note that , before searching for the spikes , it is useful to still use the oscillatory correction @xcite because the oscillator ( [ e : apost ] ) can account for any periodic behavior present in the residual phase .",
    "we also considered including a correction to the amplitude , in the form of an oscillator similar to eq .",
    "( [ e : apost ] ) .",
    "our preliminary examination of this question did not reveal any significant improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio and therefor this approach did not warrant any further exploration .",
    "quantitative results about the usefulness of the `` spiky '' templates in improving detection rates have been presented , studying two configurations for which precession is most important ( @xmath12 and @xmath52 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "we find that , even in the most unfavorable cases , the detection rate is reduced by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is to be compared with the factor of 10 reduction when precession is ignored altogether and the factor of 5 when the apostolatos oscillatory correction is included .",
    "we view our results as very encouraging , especially when one considers the very moderate number of parameters involved ( two for each spike ) .",
    "of course , it must be possible to obtain higher @xmath21 by using templates with more parameters , but the applicability to real searches may be problematic in terms of the associated computational efficiency . in our effort to find this new family of templates ,",
    "keeping the number of parameters as low as possible was one of the main priorities , as long as the improvement in the detection rate is satisfactory .    in this study we focused on trying to quantify the efficiency of the newly proposed template family in increasing the snr .",
    "for the immediate future there are a number of issues that we would like to examine in more detail , as our computational resources permit .",
    "the ultimate question is whether the `` spiky '' family of templates and the search procedure described here can be used in real searches .    as the very first step",
    ", we would like to examine this family s efficiency when we move away from the approximations of simple precession and we consider more complicated precession signals , obtained by numerical integration of more complete post - newtonian dynamics for example @xcite .",
    "we expect that the results will not change dramatically because of the generic nature of our family of templates .",
    "indeed , the procedure presented in this paper should reproduce rather accurately any superposition of oscillatory ( apostolatos ansatz ) and monotonic ( the spikes ) behaviors in the phase .",
    "moreover , we found that the results did not change very much when higher order pn - effects were included in the non - precessing part ( cf .",
    "[ ss : results ] ) .",
    "low false alarm rates and moderate numbers of templates needed for real searches are amongst the other properties that must be asserted .",
    "issues related to reliable physical parameter estimation are also important , if we want to think about questions of interest to gravitational - wave astrophysics that goes beyond detection .",
    "we plan to conduct these studies in the near future and implement the `` spiky '' templates in ligo algorithm library ( lal ) @xcite , should they constitute a viable family .",
