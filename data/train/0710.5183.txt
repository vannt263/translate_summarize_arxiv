    "supermassive black holes are known to exist at the centers of most galaxies .",

    "2000 ) or k - band absolute magnitude ( marconi & hunt 2003 ) , indicates that the evolution of the central black hole and that of its host galaxy are inextricably linked .",
    "most recent work relating the activity of the central supermassive black hole to galaxy evolution has focused on the interaction of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with their environment , in order to resolve the cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters and bring hierarchical models of galaxy formation into agreement with observations of galaxies at low redshift ( see , e.g. , dunn & fabian 2006 ; best et  al .",
    "2006 ; croton et  al .",
    "hardcastle et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) separated these agn into two classes , low excitation and high excitation radio galaxies , based on their optical emission line characteristics , and suggested that the observed differences between the two classes are determined by the fuel source and accretion mode of the central black hole .",
    "low excitation radio galaxies tend to be massive , dominant elliptical galaxies , residing in the deep dark matter potentials near the cores of large groups and rich clusters , and are surrounded by an ample supply of hot gas from the intracluster medium falling into their large gas halos .",
    "they show no evidence for a standard , geometrically thin , optically thick , luminous accretion disk .",
    "radiatively inefficient bondi accretion of hot gas accreted from their surroundings onto the central supermassive black hole is sufficient to supply the total energy , mechanical as well as radiative , observed in these systems .",
    "in contrast , high excitation radio galaxies ( containing the most powerful radio galaxies known ) exhibit high - excitation , narrow - line optical emission in their spectra , characteristic of emission from an accretion disk .",
    "hardcastle et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that agn activity in these galaxies is powered by radiatively efficient accretion of cold gas acquired in a major merger with a massive cold - gas - rich partner .",
    "the high radio power and jets observed in high excitation radio galaxies often may result from the formation of a rapidly spinning nucleus from the coalescence of the merging galaxies two massive black holes ( wilson & colbert 1995 ; capetti & balmaverde 2005 ) .    since cold - gas accretion is associated with the galaxy s interaction and merger history , and does not depend on the depth of the dark matter potential or the presence of a hot intracluster medium , galaxy collisions of lower mass galaxies with dusty , gas - rich partners in galaxy groups also would be expected to trigger agn activity and black hole growth .",
    "gravitational and hydrodynamical forces , induced by the galaxies mutual interaction , funnel dust and cold gas from the gas - rich partner into the interacting , lower - mass companion galaxy s nuclear region , where it settles into an optically thick accretion disk before subsequently accreting onto the central black hole . as in the evolutionary model of churazov",
    "et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , accretion onto the supermassive black hole is radiatively efficient and radio emission from the agn may be weak or absent .",
    "such galaxy collisions were likely frequent at high redshift ( @xmath14 ) , when the fraction of blue , gas - rich starforming galaxies in moderately massive galaxy groups was high and galaxies were rapidly evolving ( cooper et  al .  2006 ; gerke et  al .",
    "thus , while perhaps less dramatic than radio - loud systems , cold - gas accretion in off - axis galaxy collisions and minor mergers may play an equally important role in the evolution of lower mass galaxies and moderately massive galaxy groups into what we see today .",
    "observations of nearby interacting galaxies in similarly moderately massive groups offer a unique window into the dynamical processes that triggered agn activity in lower mass galaxies and influenced the coevolution of the host galaxy with its central supermassive black hole at this earlier epoch , when galaxies were rapidly transforming .",

    "the @xmath128-[4.5]$ ] color of ic  4970 s nucleus is too blue , falling below the color - color selection ` wedge ' shown in their figure 1 , but the @xmath129-[8.0]$ ] color of ic  4970 s nucleus is far redder than the zero redshift endpoint of the evolutionary track for the normal s0/sa galaxy ngc  4429 , also shown in that figure . however , the stern et  al .",
    "selection ` wedge ' was based on a photometrically identified sample of bright quasars and seyfert @xmath12 galaxies , rather than highly obscured seyfert @xmath13s .",
    "given that @xmath130 of the narrow line agn identified in their sample also fall outside the color - color selection wedge , these criteria likely do not apply to ic  4970 .",
    "lacy et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) used quasars from the sloan digital sky survey to empirically define a selection region in the mid - infrared color - color space defined by the @xmath131 and @xmath132 flux density ratios .",
    "objects red in both colors are likely agn .",
    "these mid - infrared colors for the nucleus of ic  4970 ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) are both red and are consistent with the colors of obscured agn candidates in the lacy et  al .  sample ( see fig . 1 in lacy et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "thus both the x - ray properties ( spectrum and variability ) and mid - infrared colors suggest ic  4970 hosts a highly obscured seyfert @xmath13 nucleus .",
    "we use a @xmath135 circular source region and the same annular background region that was used for the nucleus ( ` north source ' and ` nucleus bkg ' , respectively , in table [ tab : regions ] ) to measure the net x - ray source counts in the combined @xmath136ks observation from the near - nuclear x - ray source , located @xmath74kpc to the north of the agn ( see the right panel of figure [ fig : closeup ] ) . since the near - nuclear x - ray source is separated from the nucleus by only @xmath137 and the nucleus",
    "is located @xmath138 from the acis - i aim point for this observation , the agn and near - nuclear point source are resolved in the @xmath71kev energy band , but are not resolved in the @xmath107kev energy band .",
    "we find a total of @xmath139 net source counts in the @xmath71kev energy band for the northern , near - nuclear x - ray source and , to avoid contamination from the nucleus , use only the @xmath71kev count rate to determine its luminosity .",
    "assuming galactic absorption of @xmath140@xmath6 , and absorbed power law spectral models with photon indices @xmath141 , typical for luminous x - ray point sources ( see , e.g. colbert et  al .  2004 ; swartz et  al .",
    "2004 ) , we find a @xmath0kev luminosity for the near - nuclear x - ray point source of @xmath142ergs@xmath3 , where the errors reflect both the range of photon indices considered in our spectral models and the @xmath31 statistical uncertainty in the @xmath71kev count rate .",
    "thus the near - nuclear x - ray point source is an ultra - luminous x - ray source .",
    "our estimate for the luminosity of the near - nuclear x - ray source should be considered a lower bound on its intrinsic luminosity , since @xmath11 nonstellar emission in the center of ic  4970 suggests that obscuring material may extend outside the nucleus ( see  [ sec : iraccol ] ) , and ultra - luminous x - ray sources , on average , tend to be moderately absorbed ( @xmath143@xmath6 ; swartz et  al .",
    "2004 ) .      to estimate the amount of hot gas in ic  4970 outside the nucleus",
    ", we measure the x - ray emission from an elliptical region , based on the distribution of starlight in the image of ic  4970 shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : pavogroup ] , excluding a central ellipse containing the two point sources near the nucleus ( denoted ` full extent ' and ` central ' in table [ tab : regions ] ) .",
    "the local background is again the nearby @xmath88 circular region ` igm ' in table [ tab : regions ] .",
    "x - ray emission outside the central region is weak with only @xmath144 net source counts in the @xmath71kev energy band , for the combined @xmath136ks observation .",
    "we estimate the amount of this emission that is the result of low mass x - ray binaries in ic  4970 using the low mass x - ray binary cumulative luminosity function for early type galaxies from gilfanov ( 2004 ) , normalized by the stellar mass determined from k - band photometry of the @xmath13 micron all sky survey image of the same region .",
    "we model the excess @xmath71kev emission with a raymond - smith thermal plasma model , assuming a gas temperature of @xmath145kev and metallicities of @xmath146 , typical for the interstellar medium of early type galaxies ( see , e.g. machacek et  al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) , and galactic absorption of @xmath147@xmath6(dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "we find a total @xmath71kev luminosity outside the central region of ic  4970 of @xmath148ergs@xmath3 , with @xmath149ergs@xmath3(@xmath150 ) from the thermal component and @xmath151ergs@xmath3(@xmath152 ) from low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "using the raymond - smith spectral model normalization to estimate the mean electron density and gas mass outside ic  4970 s central region , we find ( for uniform filling ) mean electron densities of @xmath153@xmath120and hot gas masses of @xmath154 , where the ranges reflect uncertainties in the assumed metal abundance and geometry . this is a factor @xmath155 less than the amount of cold hi gas that may be associated with the galaxy ( horellou & koribalski 2007 ) .",
    "thus either the gravitational potential of ic  4970 is too shallow to hold a significant hot gas halo or , alternatively , the hot gas has been stripped during the collision of ic  4970 with the spiral galaxy ngc  6872 and/or by its interaction with the pavo group intra - group medium during the supersonic passage of the ngc  6872/ic  4970 galaxy pair through the pavo group core .",
    "the mass of the central black hole in galaxies is tightly correlated with the absolute k - band luminosity of the galaxy bulge , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the mass of the black hole in solar masses and and @xmath158 is the absolute k - band luminosity of the galaxy s bulge in solar luminosities ( marconi & hunt 2003 ) . for early type galaxies ,",
    "like ic  4970 , the bulge luminosity in eq .",
    "[ eq : bhmass ] is replaced by the total k - band luminosity of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "thus we use photometry of the ` full extent ' source region from table [ tab : regions ] , with the ` igm ' region as a local background , on @xmath159 images from the @xmath13 micron all sky survey to measure the k - band luminosity of ic  4970 . since it is likely that ic  4970 and ngc  6872 lie near the core of the pavo group ( machacek et  al .",
    "2005 ) , such that the luminosity distance is @xmath35mpc , we find @xmath160 and the central black hole mass of @xmath161 . if instead we use the b - band mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath162 ) for ic  4970 , that was needed in simulations to reproduce the tidal features observed in the spiral galaxy ngc  6872 ( mihos 1993 ; horellou & koribalski 2007 ) , we find a dynamical mass of @xmath163 within a b - band effective radius of @xmath164 ( @xmath165kpc ) , implying a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath166kms@xmath3 .",
    "then from the @xmath167 relationship ( gebhardt et  al .  2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , we infer a central black hole mass for ic  4970 of @xmath168 , a factor @xmath169 smaller than that obtained from the @xmath170 relationship , but consistent within its @xmath171dex scatter ( hardcastle et  al .",
    "2007 ) .      from the x - ray properties of the nuclear region of ic  4970 , we can estimate the accretion power available from hot gas in the nuclear region , and compare the available accretion power from hot gas to the luminosity of the nucleus to constrain the accretion mode of the agn . for a @xmath172 black hole",
    "the eddington luminosity is @xmath173ergs@xmath3 , such that for the bright state , @xmath174 , consistent with @xmath175 observed for heavily absorbed , accretion powered radio galaxies ( evans et  al .",
    "thus , even in the bright state , the radiative power is sub - eddington .",
    "the mass accretion rate needed to produce the observed x - ray luminosity is given by @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath178 is the speed of light .",
    "assuming a @xmath103 radiative efficiency , the mass accretion rate needed to power the agn in ic  4970 is @xmath179gs@xmath3 .",
    "this should be considered a lower limit on the required mass accretion rate , since for accretion powered agn , the bolometric luminosity is likely a factor @xmath180 higher ( elvis et  al .  1994 ) than @xmath181 , and radiative efficiencies @xmath182 may be more common ( evans et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the accretion rate available from the bondi accretion of hot gas onto the central black hole is given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the gravitational constant , @xmath157 is the black hole mass , @xmath185 is the sound speed and @xmath186 is the gas density at the bondi radius @xmath187 ( see , e.g. , allen et  al .",
    "2006 ) . in our case",
    "the bondi radius is small ( @xmath87pc ) , so we use the limits on the hot gas near the nucleus derived from assuming all of the excess @xmath71kev emission in the nuclear region was thermal ( see  [ sec : xrayspec ] ) . for hot gas with temperature @xmath188kev and electron density @xmath189@xmath120accreting onto a @xmath172 black hole , we find a bondi accretion rate of @xmath190gs@xmath3 . this is less than @xmath191 of the lower limit on the mass accretion rate @xmath192 needed to power the agn .",
    "the available bondi accretion power is very sensitive to the temperature of the hot gas through the dependence of eq .",
    "[ eq : bondi ] on the gas sound speed , with lower gas temperatures allowing higher accretion rates .",
    "however , even for the @xmath30 confidence lower limit on the gas temperature ( @xmath193kev ) for hot gas in the nuclear region , the available mass accretion rate ( @xmath194gs@xmath3 ) is still a factor of three too small to power the observed x - ray luminosity and likely an order of magnitude too small to provide the total bolometric power for the agn .",
    "furthermore , if we have overestimated the black hole mass by a factor two , as suggested by previous numerical simulations of the interaction of ic  4970 with the larger spiral galaxy ngc  6872 ( mihos et  al .",
    "1993 , horellou & koribalski 2007 ) , the bondi accretion rates quoted above would be reduced by an additional factor of four .",
    "thus the most likely explanation for the nuclear activity in ic  4970 is that the active nucleus was triggered by the accretion of cold ( hi ) gas and dust driven into its center as a result of ic  4970 s ongoing interaction with the spiral galaxy ngc  6872 . since numerical simulations of the ngc  6872/ic  4970 system by horellou & koribalski ( 2007 ) suggest that ic  4970 will accrete significant amounts of matter during this interaction , some , if not all , of the dust and cold gas fueling ic  4970 s nucleus may have been acquired by ic  4970 during its passage through the northern spiral arm of its much larger , gas - rich spiral partner . such interactions would have been frequent between galaxies in groups at high redshift , when the fraction of gas - rich spirals was high , thereby promoting agn activity and black hole growth in lower mass galaxies , that are unable to retain significant hot gas halos because of their shallow gravitational potentials .",
    "in this paper we use _ chandra _ x - ray and _ spitzer _ irac mid - infrared observations to probe nuclear activity in ic  4970 , the interacting companion galaxy to the large spiral galaxy ngc  6872 in the pavo galaxy group .",
    "we find the following :    * x - ray emission from the nucleus of ic  4970 is time variable with the mean @xmath0kev count rate increasing by a factor of three on @xmath4ks time scales .",
    "this strongly suggests ic  4970 s nucleus hosts an agn rather than a compact nuclear starburst . *",
    "the x - ray spectrum of ic  4970 s nucleus in the bright state shows a clear fe k@xmath9 line and is well described by an absorbed power law plus narrow gaussian line model with absorption column @xmath5@xmath6 , fixed photon indices @xmath195 , and an fe k@xmath9 line equivalent width of @xmath10ev .",
    "the @xmath0kev x - ray luminosity of the nucleus in the bright state is @xmath104ergs@xmath3 and in the faint state is @xmath112ergs@xmath3 . with these data",
    ", we find no significant difference in the power law slope or intrinsic absorption between the bright and faint nuclear states .",
    "* nonstellar @xmath11 emission is concentrated in the central @xmath44kpc ( @xmath123 ) of ic  4970 , consistent with high obscuration in this region .",
    "the mid - infrared colors of the nucleus , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , are consistent with the mid - infrared colors expected for highly obscured agn candidate sources .",
    "thus the x - ray and mid - infrared properties of the nucleus of ic  4970 suggest that it is a highly obscured seyfert @xmath13 . * assuming that the @xmath71kev x - ray emission observed in the nuclear region is all thermal , the spectrum is consistent with an absorbed @xmath198kev apec model with solar metallicity , a hydrogen absorbing column of @xmath199@xmath6 , and intrinsic @xmath0 luminosity of @xmath118ergs@xmath3 . for uniform",
    "filling , the inferred mean electron density and hot gas mass in the nuclear region are @xmath119@xmath120and @xmath200 , respectively . * an ultra - luminous x - ray source with @xmath0kev intrinsic luminosity of @xmath201ergs@xmath3 is found @xmath74kpc from ic  4970 s nucleus . *",
    "little diffuse x - ray emission is observed outside the nuclear region .",
    "assuming @xmath145kev interstellar galaxy gas , the x - ray luminosity of diffuse gas outside the central @xmath12kpc of the galaxy is @xmath202ergs@xmath3and gas mass is @xmath203 .",
    "either the gravitational potential of ic  4970 is too shallow to retain a significant hot gas halo , or that halo has been stripped by the interaction of ic  4970 with ngc  6872 and the pavo group intra - group medium .",
    "* from the correlation between black hole mass and k - band luminosity , we expect ic  4970 to host a @xmath161 black hole .",
    "bondi accretion of hot gas in the nuclear region of ic  4970 onto the black hole can account for only @xmath204 of the observed x - ray luminosity of the agn , such that the dominant power source for the active nucleus is likely the accretion of dust and cold gas driven into ic  4970 s nuclear region by the galaxy s ongoing interaction with the gas - rich spiral galaxy ngc  6872 .",
