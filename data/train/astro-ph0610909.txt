    "distant powerful radio galaxies are important laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of massive galaxies , because they are among the most luminous and largest known galaxies in the early universe and likely progenitors of dominant cluster galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are generally embedded in giant ( cd - sized ) ionized gas halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surrounded by galaxy overdensities , whose structures have sizes of a few mpc @xcite .",
    "the radio galaxy hosts have clumpy optical morphologies @xcite , spectra indicative of extreme star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and large stellar masses @xcite . because the radio lifetimes ( few times 10@xmath4 yr ) are much smaller than cosmological timescales , the statistics are consistent with every dominant cluster galaxy having gone through a luminous radio phase during its evolution @xcite",
    "hence , distant radio galaxies may be typical progenitors of galaxies that dominate the cores of local clusters .",
    "the radio source mrc 1138262 , identified with a galaxy at @xmath5 , is one of the most intensively studied distant radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "several of its properties are those expected of the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy .",
    "the @xmath6-band luminosity corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath2 @xcite , implying that mrc 1138262 is one of the most massive galaxies known at @xmath9 .",
    "the host galaxy is surrounded by a giant ly@xmath10 halo @xcite and the faraday rotation of the radio source is among the largest known @xcite , indicating that the system is embedded in a dense hot ionized gas with an ordered magnetic field .",
    "the radio galaxy is associated with a 3 mpc - sized structure of galaxies , of estimated mass @xmath11 2 @xmath1@xmath12 @xmath2 , the presumed antecedent of a local cluster .",
    "the presence of this ",
    "protocluster \" has been deduced using three independent selection techniques .",
    "there are overdensities of ly@xmath10 and h@xmath10 emission lines objects and galaxies having 4000   break continuum features at the approximate redshift of the radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "previous observations of mrc 1138262 with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ indicated that its optical emission is clumpy @xcite , indicative of a merging structure . here",
    "we present a new _ hst _ image of the radio galaxy that reaches 2 mag fainter than previous images and shows the merging processes in unprecedented detail .    throughout this letter",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath13 = 72 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath14 = 0.27 , and @xmath15 = 0.73 , implying that at the distance of mrc 1138262 , an angular scale of 1  corresponds to a projected linear scale of 8.3 kpc .",
    "we obtained deep images of mrc 1138262 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; * ? ? ? * ) on the _ hst_. the centre of the 1138262 protocluster was observed with the acs during 2005 1722 may in two 34@xmath134 acs fields that overlapped by 1 in a region that includes the radio galaxy .",
    "the total exposure time in the overlapping region was nine orbits with the f475w ( @xmath16 ) filter and 10 orbits with the f814w ( @xmath17 ) filter .",
    "the filters were selected to sample the continuum radiation with maximum sensitivity and colour discrimination , while minimizing contamination from bright emission lines .",
    "although the @xmath181549 and @xmath181640 lines fall within the @xmath16 passband , their measured rest - frame equivalent widths are 6 and 10  , respectively @xcite , implying that their effect on the continuum image is negligible .",
    "the observations were processed through the acs gto pipeline @xcite to produce registered , cosmic - ray rejected images . a deep 19 orbit composite image of the continuum emission",
    "was then produced by adding the @xmath16 and @xmath17 images .",
    "the @xmath19 depth in the overlapping region is 29.3 and 29.0 mag in the respective @xmath16 and @xmath17 images measured in a square @xmath20 diameter aperture .",
    "the _ hst _ image of the host galaxy and its immediate surroundings is shown in figure 1 , with rest - frame velocities of the ly@xmath10 emission corresponding to several of the acs continuum clumps .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the relation of the continuum optical emission to the associated gaseous halo and relativistic plasma .",
    "the giant gaseous halo extends by at least 25  ( @xmath7200 kpc ) and is one of the largest ly@xmath10 structures known in the universe .",
    "there are several features in the figures that are of interest :    \\1 .",
    "the optical continuum emission of the galaxy consists of at least 10 distinct clumps .",
    "the clumps are presumably satellite galaxies that are still merging with mrc 1138262 .",
    "they have sizes of typically @xmath70105 , corresponding to @xmath715 kpc , i.e. comparable to the typical sizes of lyman break galaxies @xcite",
    "several of the satellites have elongated structures reminiscent of chain and tadpole galaxies recently found to dominate the resolved population of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "examples are denoted by numbers 1 , 3 , and 4 in figure 1 .",
    "another linear , distorted galaxy is seen 3  north of the nucleus ( 2 ) , and several galaxies having double ( 6 , 8) or clumpy morphologies embedded in diffuse emission ( 5 , 7 ) lie at slightly larger distances from the main complex .",
    "these objects have @xmath21 colors of between 0.1 and 0.7 magnitudes and @xmath17 magnitudes of between 24.3 and 27.7 , consistent with star formation at rates between 0.5 and 26 @xmath22 yr@xmath3 @xcite .    to determine whether there is a concentration of such objects around the radio galaxy",
    ", we analyzed the statistics of tadpole and chain galaxies having @xmath23 in the whole 3@xmath15  acs field around mrc 1138262 . to minimize systematic effects , the morphologies were classified manually by somebody not previously associated with the project ( e. h. ) . in the 10@xmath110  area around the radio galaxy ,",
    "three such objects were found ( objects 1 , 3 , and 4 in fig .",
    "this should be compared with an expected number of 0.22 from our analysis of the whole field , a value consistent with the hudf analysis of @xcite .",
    "taking into account the clustering of these objects , the probability of finding three such galaxies within a 10@xmath110   region was estimated to be parts in 1000 .",
    "this implies that the chain and tadpole galaxies are concentrated at the position of the radio galaxy and connected with the forming massive galaxy at the protocluster centre .",
    "faint diffuse emission is visible between the obvious clumps .",
    "this extended emission is unlikely to be dominated by scattered light of an obscured nuclear quasar , because its morphology is not reminiscent of a scattering cone .",
    "furthermore , its mean color is comparable to that of the star - forming clumps , consistent with the occurrance of ongoing star formation over the whole central 50@xmath140 kpc region .",
    "the total extended luminosity ( comprising 45% of the total emission in @xmath16 ) implies a star formation rate of @xmath24100 @xmath22 yr@xmath3 .",
    "ly@xmath10 was detected from all of the satellite galaxies in the halo that have been studied spectroscopically .",
    "the width of the ly@xmath10 profile in the halo is consistent with the observed velocity dispersion of the associated protocluster , indicating that the galaxies are moving relative to each other with radial velocities of up to a few thousand kilometers per second .",
    "although the optical structure is extended approximately along the radio axis , most of the galaxy is located outside the narrow region occupied by the radio source and is therefore unlikely to be influenced directly by the radio source .",
    "the obvious interpretation of the new _ hst _ image is that it shows hierarchical merging processes occurring in a forming massive cd galaxy .",
    "the morphological complexity and clumpiness observed in the mrc 1138 - 262 system agrees qualitatively with predictions of hierarchical galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . because of its striking appearance and its probable nature",
    ", we name the host galaxy of mrc 1138262 the `` spiderweb galaxy '' and refer to the small satellite galaxies located within and around it as `` flies . '' with relative velocities of several hundred kilometers per second ( fig .",
    "1 ) , these flies will traverse the 100 kpc extent of the spiderweb many times in the interval between @xmath25 and 0 , consistent with the merger scenario .",
    "vigorous merging also provides a plausible mechanism for fueling the supermassive black hole , which may subsequently quench any ongoing star formation through radio feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using recent infrared spectroscopic observations of the gas in mrc 1138 - 262 , @xcite",
    "show that the pressure of the radio source is sufficiently large to expel @xmath26 of the gas during the radio source lifetime .",
    "after the gas available for star formation has been expelled , the growth of such a massive galaxy will proceed primarily through merging @xcite .    assuming that the flies are undergoing single @xmath71 gyr starbursts , their star formation rates imply a final stellar mass for each satellite galaxy of several times @xmath27 @xmath2 and a total mass for all the flies of @xmath28 @xmath2 .",
    "this is less than a tenth of the mass of the whole galaxy , derived from its @xmath6-band luminosity @xcite , implying that a large fraction of the galaxy mass has already assembled by @xmath29 .",
    "such a relatively early growth disagrees with the predictions of some models for typical evolution of the dominant galaxies in the most massive clusters @xcite .      the most intriguing feature in our _ hst _ image is the association of the linear flies ( chains and tadpole morphologies ) with the merging massive host galaxy . in the hudf",
    "the frequency of such objects increases dramatically at faint magnitudes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath30 @xmath24 24 ; ) . because such peculiar galaxies dominate the faint resolved galaxy population , they are likely to be an important source of star formation in the early universe .",
    "the nature of these objects is unclear .",
    "there are several possibilities .",
    "1 . they may be spiral galaxies observed edge - on @xcite . however , it is difficult to account for the large numbers of faint linear galaxies observed in the hudf by such selection effects .",
    "their elongated appearance may be due to star formation associated with radio jets @xcite produced by primeval massive black holes @xcite .",
    "radio synchrotron jets are known to occur on varying scales , ranging from the most luminous galactic nuclei to x - ray binaries and jets are sometimes associated with star formation @xcite .",
    "they may be formed as the result of merging , either of galaxies that are formed along filamentary gravitational instabilities @xcite or in major events @xmath70.7 gyr after the merging process has commenced @xcite .",
    "the fact that the spiderweb linear flies are located in an environment where vigorous galaxy interactions are taking place is consistent with a merger hypothesis for their origin",
    ". the motions of the flies with velocities of several hundred kilometers per second through the dense gaseous halo , perturbed by superwinds from the nucleus @xcite and the radio jet , could result in shocks .",
    "the shocks would then lead to jeans - unstable clouds , enhanced star formation along the direction of motion , and chain and tadpole morphologies .",
    "the morphology of the spiderweb galaxy provides a unique new testbed for simulations of forming massive galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "the occurrence of tadpole and chain galaxies in the dense central environment of the protocluster places constraints on ( 1 ) evolution models for dominant cluster galaxies and ( 2 ) the nature of the chains and tadpoles , an important constituent of the early universe .",
    "our results are consistent with a merger scenario for the formation of these peculiar linear galaxies .",
    "deep observations with the _ hst _ of similar objects over a range of redshifts are needed to study whether linear flies are generally present in the vicinity of cd galaxy progenitors and how their luminosity functions in these special regions compare with those of other types of galaxies .",
    "the positions and morphological parameters of flies in spiderweb galaxies at @xmath9 together with hubble data on dominant cluster galaxies at @xmath31 will provide new constraints for models of massive galaxy formation .",
    "future spectroscopic observations will delineate the velocity field and color distributions of mrc 1128262 in more detail , thereby elucidating further how the flies are being captured by the spiderweb galaxy .",
