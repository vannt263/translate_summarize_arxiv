    "the casimir force  @xcite between macroscopic objects originates from the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "it is known that the casimir force strongly depends on the material properties and geometry of the objects  @xcite .",

    "recently it has been suggested that the lateral casimir force may intermesh separate parts of nanomachines  @xcite .",
    "if the corrugated metallic plates are at a distance from each other that is considerably larger than the corrugation amplitudes , then the lateral force is a sinusoidal function of the relative lateral shift . to better understand the possibilities that such nanomachines could bring about",

    "one can obtain the casimir energy of two corrugated surfaces using the pws of potential @xmath91 .",

    "dcp allows us to consider arbitrary dielectric functions and arbitrary deformations with large amplitudes .",
    "however , even using the clausius - mossotti summation of terms , dcp underestimates the casimir force by a factor about @xmath15 .",
    "lifshitz and numerical results agree well as one utilizes the sixth order term of dcp  @xcite .",
    "thus dcp offers a systematic inclusion of many - body fluctuation - induced interactions , which are overlooked by pws and pfa .",

    "figures  [ fig : all_fig](a)-(c ) demonstrate clearly that one can employ various geometries and materials to engineer the displacement - dependence of the lateral casimir force .",
