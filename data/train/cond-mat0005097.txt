    "the falicov - kimball model@xcite was introduced in 1969 as a thermodynamic model for metal - insulator transitions in systems that have two different types of electrons ",

    "twenty years later , brandt and mielsch@xcite solved the falicov - kimball model exactly in the limit of infinite dimensions by using dynamical mean - field theory and the baym - kadanoff formalism .",
    "they also showed how to calculate static susceptibilities and found an ising - like phase transition to a chessboard charge - density - wave phase at half - filling .",

    "we begin with a discussion of some special symmetries of the falicov - kimball model . since the total conduction electron number is a conserved quantity , we find that @xmath21 has no @xmath22-dependence .",

    "similarly , the local @xmath0-occupation is also conserved [ @xmath23 , since @xmath24 commutes with the lattice hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that both the @xmath25-charge susceptibility and the mixed @xmath26-charge susceptibility have no @xmath22-dependence and therefore are static , with no frequency dependence .",
    "furthermore , a simple application of the chain rule and the definition of each of the susceptibilities as a derivative of the corresponding average electron filling with respect to an external field , shows that there is a discontinuity in the @xmath27-charge susceptibility at zero frequency@xcite due to the coupling of the @xmath7 and @xmath0-electrons .",

    "a key aspect of our derivation of the vertex function , is that to linear order in a single frequency component of the charge - coupled field , @xmath84 , the green s function for the effective medium , @xmath104 , like the auxiliary green s function , @xmath94 , only contains components in the two diagonals given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the full green s function is defined by : @xmath107 where @xmath18 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zdef ] ) and the time dependence of the @xmath108-operators is governed by @xmath109 .",

    "note that in the limit @xmath126 , eq.([eq : quad ] ) becomes diagonal , and reduces to the conventional quadratic expression for the self - energy in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath115 as first determined by brandt and mielsch  @xcite .",
    "the irreducible vertex function is defined in frequency space by : @xmath128 as the vertex function is independent of the absolute time , we can change variables : @xmath129 so that the @xmath130 integral yields a delta function which requires @xmath131 . hence ,",
    "given the difference between two matsubara frequencies , @xmath132 is a bosonic frequency , the vertex function becomes @xmath133    the problem is greatly simplified by calculating @xmath134 to first order in @xmath79 , for a single frequency component , @xmath84 . in this case , both @xmath134 and @xmath135 contain diagonal terms , and off - diagonal terms linear in @xmath84 where @xmath136 , so that : @xmath137 we are interested in the case where @xmath138 , as the zero - frequency response ( corresponding to a shift of the chemical potential ) is well - known  @xcite .",
    "next , we calculate the diagonal and off - diagonal pieces of the self - energy .",
    "eq.([eq : quad ] ) simplifies from a full quadratic matrix equation , to the following coupled equations : @xmath139 .",

    "we concentrate on rearranging eq.([eq : self2 ] ) to obtain the frequency - dependent response .",
    "first , we multiply both sides of eq.([eq : self2 ] ) by @xmath141 and use eq.([eq : self1 ] ) to replace the quadratic terms on the left , giving : @xmath142 \\left ( \\frac{1}{4g_{n } } - \\frac{1}{4g_{n+l}}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\   = & & \\frac{\\bar g_{n}}{4g_{n}g_{n+l } } \\left [ 2(1 - 2w_{1 } ) u - \\frac { (   g_{n}+g_{n+l } ) } { g_{n}g_{n+l } } \\right ] \\left(\\sigma_{n}+\\frac{1}{2g_{n}}-\\sigma_{n+l } -\\frac{1}{2g_{n+l}}\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above form gives rise to considerable cancellation between the two sides , leading to the amazingly simple result : @xmath143 so the only terms in @xmath134 that depend on a finite frequency component , @xmath144 , of the @xmath79 field are @xmath145 .",
    "the only terms which survive the limit , @xmath146 after differentiation , to give the vertex function , are : @xmath147    the above simple result found from this baym - kadanoff analysis is identical to that found by diagrammatic calculations  @xcite which give the more complicated form : @xmath148 \\left(1+g_{n+l}\\sigma_{n+l}\\right)\\left[1+g_{n+l}(\\sigma_{n+l}-u)\\right ] + w_{0}w_{1}u^{2}g_{n}g_{n+l } } .",
    "\\label{eq : diagres}\\ ] ] the proof of this equivalence is presented in the appendix .",
    "since the vertex function is diagonal , we have a simple form for the dynamical charge susceptibility @xmath149 in the limit @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , substitution of @xmath152 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi0_1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_final ] ) gives @xmath153 as expected by our symmetry arguments .",
    "notice that @xmath152 does not vanish ; it is the vertex corrections that force the full susceptibility to vanish .",
    "the final step in our formalism development is to perform the analytic continuation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_final ] ) from the imaginary to the real axis .",
    "our method is not completely rigorous , because we are unable to verify necessary analyticity arguments as described below , but we compare the direct calculation of the susceptibility on the imaginary axis to the inferred value there that is found by using the spectral formula from the real axis . in nearly all cases , we have accuracy to better than one part in 1000 , which supports , _ a posteriori _ , that our technique is valid",
    ".    we will consider only the case with @xmath154 here , since the @xmath151 susceptibility is trivial and since the @xmath60 case is simpler and can easily be worked out by following the same steps we use for the chessboard case .",
    "we start by replacing the summation over matsubara frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_final ] ) by three contour integrals , which are chosen as in figure 1 to encircle all of the simple poles at the fermionic matsubara frequencies , and no other poles in the corresponding integrals [ in other words , the only poles contributing are the simple poles from @xmath155 below ] .",
    "the susceptibility then becomes ( for simplicity , we consider @xmath156 here ) @xmath157 where @xmath158 $ ] is the fermi function and the subscript @xmath159 or @xmath160 refers to the retarded or advanced green s function ( or self - energy ) .",
    "the choices of the subscripts are so that the green s functions and self - energies are analytic within regions 1 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "hence the contours can be deformed until they run parallel to the real axis , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we are making an assumption that there are no other poles present within these regions , when we deform the contours .",
    "in fact , if we make an analytic continuation of just the bare susceptibility , then after continuing @xmath161 to @xmath162 we do find a pole that lies in region 2 just below the real axis ( at @xmath163 , but the residue of this pole vanishes when @xmath164 lies on the real axis .",
    "it is more difficult to make such an analysis for the full susceptibility , so we rely instead on the comparison with the direct calculation on the imaginary axis .",
    "when we evaluate the integrals along the lines indicated in figure 2 , we will evaluate the fermi function at @xmath165 , which we set equal to @xmath155 before continuing the @xmath164 frequency .",
    "then we can evaluate the final result , which becomes @xmath166 \\frac{\\frac{g^*(\\omega)+g(\\omega+\\nu)}{2\\omega+2\\mu+\\nu- \\sigma^*(\\omega)-\\sigma(\\omega+\\nu ) } } { 1-\\frac{g^*(\\omega)+g(\\omega+\\nu)}{2\\omega+2\\mu+\\nu- \\sigma^*(\\omega)-\\sigma(\\omega+\\nu)}\\frac{\\sigma^*(\\omega)- \\sigma(\\omega+\\nu)}{g^*(\\omega)-g(\\omega+\\nu)}}\\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq : chi_real_final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we replaced the advanced functions by the complex conjugate of the retarded green s function ( which is valid on the real axis ) .",
    "we performed a number of different numerical calculations of the charge response . to begin",
    ", we summarize the @xmath7-electron spectral functions in the weak - coupling @xmath167 limit , the moderate coupling limit @xmath168 and the strong - coupling limit @xmath169 , which are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "note that the interacting density of states is temperature independent for this model ( as first shown by van dongen@xcite ) . in the weak - coupling case",
    "@xmath167 the density of states looks gaussian , with only small modifications due to the interactions . at moderate coupling ,",
    "@xmath168 , we find that a pseudogap appears in the density of states at the chemical potential .",
    "note that this is a correlation - induced pseudogap and is not resulting from the charge - density - wave order of the ground state , since these results are for the high - temperature homogeneous phase .",
    "finally , a true gap develops in strong coupling @xmath169 , which rapidly approaches @xmath13 as @xmath13 increases in magnitude . in figure 4",
    "we show plots of the static chessboard susceptibility for the three different values of @xmath13 and inset a plot of the transition temperature as a function of @xmath170 .",
    "the chain - dotted lines are guides to the eye for @xmath171 at the three values of @xmath13 .",
    "the transition temperature has a classic form  increasing for weak-@xmath13 , reaching a maximum at moderate @xmath13 and then decreasing in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "notice how the static susceptibility diverges as we approach @xmath171 because we are in the thermodynamic limit . in figure 5",
    "we show the dynamical chessboard susceptibility at five different temperatures ranging from well above @xmath171 to just above @xmath171 .",
    "notice how there is a temperature dependence to the charge susceptibility , but how there is no indication of the phase transition seen in the static susceptibility ( recall the susceptibility is discontinuous at @xmath172 and we are only plotting the continuous piece of the susceptibility ) . in figure 6",
    "we show the same plot for the local dynamical susceptibility .",
    "its behavior is quite similar to that of the chessboard susceptibility , but with a less marked temperature dependence .",
    "the expected peak in the imaginary part at low frequencies due to quasiparticle excitations can be seen , and it has a classic `` triangular '' shape as expected in a noninteracting system ( recall the local susceptibility is the average over all momentum vectors , so we expect a linear contribution at small frequency and a curved drop off at high frequencies as we reach the approximate half bandwidth ) .",
    "the case of moderate coupling is shown in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "here , the chessboard susceptibility actually decreases as @xmath173 is lowered because of the pseudogap in the density of states .",
    "once again the temperature dependence of the local susceptibility is much less than the chessboard susceptibility ( and we are including data below the @xmath171 to the charge - density - wave instability ) .",
    "the development from a single low - energy peak in the real part , to two nearly overlapping peaks ( corresponding to charge transfer excitations ) , is clear even at moderate coupling where the density of states has only a pseudogap .",
    "note once again that these peak developments arise from correlation effects and not from an underlying charge - density - wave order because these calculations are all performed within the homogeneous phase ( even when we go below @xmath171 ) .    in figures 9 and 10",
    "we show the results at strong coupling @xmath174 .",
    "the charge susceptibility shows a number of interesting new features in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the charge - transfer peaks , which are easiest seen as broad peaks in the imaginary part of the susceptibility , are present at the expected locations of @xmath175 . at high temperatures ,",
    "the system has a large peak in the real part of the susceptibility near zero frequency , which rapidly decreases as @xmath173 is lowered , and becomes unnoticable at low temperatures .",
    "the imaginary part goes from having a linear behavior at low frequency to being essentially zero .",
    "hence , in addition to the energy scale of the order of @xmath13 ( corresponding to the large charge - transfer peaks in the imaginary part of the susceptibility ) there is a low - energy scale on the order of @xmath176 that determines the low - temperature evolution of the charge excitations and the energy scale of those low - energy excitations .",
    "the high - energy features are `` frozen in '' at a high temperature scale , and there is strong temperature evolution in the low - frequency regime until @xmath173 becomes smaller than the low - energy scale where the low - energy features are `` frozen in . ''",
    "we believe these low - energy charge excitations are associated with virtual hopping processes , where an electron virtually hops onto a site occupied by a localized electron , and then hops off that site .",
    "such processes turn off at temperatures below @xmath176 .",
    "once again the dependence of the chessboard and the local susceptibilities are similar and there is no signal of the phase transition in the dynamical piece of the charge susceptibility .",
    "we find that we lose some accuracy in our calculations at strong coupling , perhaps arising from the gap in the density of states and its effect on the low - temperature charge dynamics .",
    "another possibility is that there are additional poles and resides that need to be taken into account in our `` approximate '' analytic continuation .",
    "one illustration of the numerical difficulties is that we no longer have an accuracy of one part in a thousand ( it is typically a few parts in a thousand ) when we evaluate the charge susceptibility on the imaginary axis by using the spectral formula and comparing with a direct calculation on the imaginary axis .",
    "another illustration is that at the lowest temperatures the imaginary part of the spectral function becomes slightly negative for a frequency range in the vicinity of @xmath177 ( where the imaginary part is approximately @xmath178 ) , which must be a numerical artifact due to the fact that the spectral function is known to be nonnegative for positive values of the frequency .",
    "we have presented a nontrivial example of the baym - kadanoff formalism to derive the dynamical susceptibilities of the falicov - kimball model . the dynamical susceptibility breaks into two pieces , a static piece that reflects the coupling of the system to the charge - density - wave distortions , and a frequency - dependent piece , which is less affected by any underlying charge - density - wave order .",
    "we developed the formalism to evaluate this frequency - dependent piece of the susceptibility exactly on the imaginary axis .",
    "we also developed an analytic - continuation scheme that we were unable to establish with full rigor due to the possibility of a small contribution from neglected residues of poles that could arise within the analytic - continuation procedure , but which is nevertheless quite accurate over a wide range of parameters .",
    "we find a number of interesting properties of this model : ( 1 ) the static and dynamical susceptibilities are decoupled  the static susceptibility diverges at @xmath171 , but no signal of this phase transition is seen in the dynamical susceptibility ; ( 2 ) the momentum dependence of the dynamical susceptibility is not too strong around the chessboard point ",
    "we see little variation between the @xmath154 and @xmath60 susceptibilities , but the @xmath151 susceptibility vanishes by symmetry , so momentum dependence is stronger near the brillouin zone center ; and ( 3 ) the dynamical susceptibilities do possess temperature dependence even though the interacting density of states is temperature independent .",
    "the temperature dependence is most striking in the strong - coupling regime where a low - energy scale on the order of @xmath176 arises and the charge susceptibility has a strong temperature dependence near this approximate temperature .",
    "our application of the baym - kadanoff formalism provides an interesting counterpoint to the diagrammatic derivation about the atomic limit , and can be applied to other related problems where the so - called `` static approximation '' is exact .",
    "we have not examined any effects away from half - filling or at incommensurate wavevectors here .",
    "we leave those tasks to another publication .",
    "this research was supported by the office of naval research under grant number n00014 - 99 - 1 - 0328 .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with t. devereaux , d. hess , j. serene , and a. shvaika .",
    "to compare our result with the diagrammatic approach  @xcite , we must begin with shvaika s result for the frequency - dependent piece of the reducible vertex function , @xmath179 by making the replacement , @xmath180^{-1 }   = \\left(g_{n}\\right)^{-1 } + \\sigma_{n}$ ] , eq.([eq : shvaika ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath181 \\left(1+g_{n+l}\\sigma_{n+l}\\right)\\left[1+g_{n+l}(\\sigma_{n+l}-u)\\right ] } .\\ ] ] solving dyson s equation for the irreducible vertex function , @xmath182 : @xmath183 then yields eq .",
