    "the theory of cps is a framework for design and analysis of distributed algorithms for coordination of the groups of dynamic agents . in many control problems ,",
    "agents in the group need to agree upon certain quantity , whose interpretation depends on the problem at hand . the theory of cps studies the convergence to a common value ( consensus ) in its general and , therefore , abstract form .",
    "it has been a subject of intense research due to diverse applications in applied science and engineering .",
    "the latter include coordination of groups of unmanned vehicles @xcite ; synchronization of power , sensor and communication networks @xcite ; and principles underlying collective behavior in social networks @xcite and biological systems @xcite , to name a few .    from the mathematical point of view , analysis of continuous time cps is a stability problem for systems of linear differential equations possibly with additional features such as stochastic perturbations or time delays .",
    "there are many effective techniques for studying stability of linear systems @xcite .",
    "the challenge of applying these methods to the analysis of cps is twofold .",
    "first , one is interested in characterizing stability under a minimal number of practically relevant assumptions on the structure of the matrix of coefficients , which may depend on time .",
    "second , it is important to identify the relation between the structure of the graph of interactions in the network to the dynamical performance of cps .",
    "a successful solution of the second problem requires a compilation of dynamical systems and graph theoretic techniques .",
    "this naturally leads to spectral methods , which play important roles in both mathematical disciplines , and are especially useful for problems on the interface between dynamics and the graph theory @xcite . a general idea for using spectral methods for analyzing cps",
    "is that , on the one hand , stability of the continuous time cp is encoded in the eigenvalues ( evs ) of the matrix of coefficients ; on the other hand , evs of the same matrix capture structural properties of the graph of the cp .",
    "the spectral graph theory offers many fine results relating the structural properties of graphs to the evs of the adjacency matrix and the graph laplacian @xcite .",
    "this provides a link between the network topology and the dynamical properties of cps .    in this paper , under fairly general assumptions on cps , we study two problems : convergence of cps and their stability in the presence of stochastic perturbations .",
    "the former is the problem of asymptotic stability of the consensus subspace , a one - dimensional invariant ( center ) subspace .",
    "the latter is a special albeit representative form of stability of the consensus subspace with respect to constantly acting perturbations @xcite .",
    "the rate of convergence to the consensus subspace sets the timescale of the consensus formation ( or synchronization ) from arbitrary initial conditions or upon instantaneous perturbation .",
    "therefore , the convergence rate is important in applications where the timing of the system s responses matters ( e.g. , in decision making algorithms , neuronal networks , etc ) .",
    "stochastic stability , on the other hand , characterizes robustness of the consensus to noise .",
    "this form of stability is important when the consensus needs to be maintained in noisy environment over large periods of time ( e.g. , communication networks , control of unmanned vehicles , etc ) .",
    "we believe that our quantitative description of these two forms of stability elucidates two important aspects of the performance of cps .",
    "the questions investigated in this paper have been studied before under various hypotheses on cps : constant weights @xcite , time - dependent interactions @xcite , and cps with time - delays @xcite .",
    "optimization problems arising in the context of cp design were studied in @xcite .",
    "there is a body of related work on discrete time cps @xcite .",
    "robustness of cps to noise was studied in @xcite . in this paper , we offer a unified approach to studying convergence and stochastic stability of cps .",
    "our method applies to networks with directed information flow ; both cooperative and noncooperative interactions ; networks under weak stochastic forcing ; and those whose topology and strength of connections may vary in time .",
    "we derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing convergence of time - dependent cps and present estimates characterizing their stochastic stability . for cps on undirected graphs , we show that the rate of convergence and stability to random perturbations are captured by the generalized algebraic connectivity and the total effective resistance of the underlying graphs .",
    "previously , these results were available only for cps on graphs with positive weights @xcite . to further elucidate the role that network topology plays in shaping the dynamical properties of cps , we further develop our results for cps on simple networks ( see text for the definition of a simple network ) .",
    "our analysis of simple networks reveals the role of the geometric properties of the cycle subspace associated with the graph of the network ( such as the first betti number of the graph ; the length and the mutual position of the independent cycles ) to the stability of cps to random perturbations . in addition",
    ", we explore several implications of the results of the spectral graph theory to cp design .",
    "first , we show that expanders , sparse highly connected graphs @xcite , generate cps with the rate of convergence bounded from zero uniformly when the size of the network tends to infinity .",
    "in particular , cps based on expanders are effective for coordinating large networks .",
    "second , we point out that cps with random connections have nearly optimal convergence rate . in contrast",
    ", the convergence of cps on regular lattice - like graphs slows down rapidly as the size of the network grows .",
    "we illustrate these observations with numerical examples and refer to the relevant graph - theoretic results .",
    "the mathematical analysis of cps in this paper uses the method , which we recently developed for studying synchronization in systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators @xcite and reliability of neuronal networks @xcite .",
    "we further develop this method in several ways .",
    "first , we relate the key properties of the algebraic transformation of the coupling operator used in @xcite for studying synchronization to general properties of a certain class of pseudo - similarity transformations .",
    "second , we strengthen the graph theoretic interpretation of the stability analysis . we believe that our method will be useful for design and analysis of cps and for studying synchronization in a large class of models .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ algebra ] , we study the properties of a pseudo - similarity transformation , which is used in the analysis of cps in the remainder of the paper .",
    "section  [ convergence ] is devoted to the convergence analysis of cps . after formulating the problem and introducing necessary terminology in  [ formulation ] , we study convergence of cps with constant and time - dependent coefficients in  [ stationary ] and  [ nonstationary ] respectively .",
    "section  [ robustness ] presents estimates characterizing stochastic stability of stationary and time - dependent cps .",
    "these results are applied to study cps protocols on undirected weighted graph in section  [ undirected ] . in section  [ connectivity ] , we discuss the relation between the connectivity of the graph and dynamical performance of cps .",
    "the results of this paper are summarized in section  [ conclude ] .",
