    "hochschild cohomology is a useful tool for studying deformation theory and it was studied extensively over the years ( for example see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "higher order hochschild ( co)homology was introduced by pirashvili in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it associated to a simplicial set @xmath0 , a commutative @xmath1-algebra @xmath2 and an @xmath2-bimodule @xmath3 , the higher hochschild cohomology groups @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath0 is the standard simplicial set associated to the sphere @xmath5 , one recovers the usual hochschild cohomology .",
    "one important feature of these cohomology groups is that they depend only on the homotopy type of the geometric realization of the simplicial set @xmath0 . for more recent results about higher hochschild cohomology see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "secondary hochschild cohomology was introduced in @xcite where it was used to study @xmath6-algebra structures on the algebra @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "it associates to a triple @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 gives the @xmath6-algebra structure on @xmath2 ) , and an @xmath2-bimodule @xmath3 that is @xmath6-symmetric , the secondary hochschild cohomology groups @xmath10 .",
    "the main difference from the usual hochschild cohomology is that the secondary hochschild cohomology gives information about both , the product and the @xmath6-algebra structure on @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "many of the results that are known for hochschild cohomology can be extended to secondary hochschild cohomology .",
    "one can study @xmath6-extensions of the algebra @xmath2 , show that @xmath11 is a multiplicative operad and admits a hodge type decomposition ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a cyclic version of the secondary cohomology that can be described using a generalization of the bar resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to show that secondary hochschild cohomology is a certain version of higher order hochschild cohomology .",
    "more precisely , we consider a simplicial pair @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is a simplicial set and @xmath0 is simplicial subset of @xmath13 ) , a triple @xmath8 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath6 are commutative @xmath1-algebras , and @xmath14 is a morphism of @xmath1-algebras ) and @xmath3 a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule . to this setting",
    "we associate the groups @xmath15 . when @xmath16 we recover the higher order hochschild cohomology @xmath17 . when @xmath18 with the natural simplicial structure , we recover the secondary hochschild cohomology @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we fix a field @xmath1 and denote @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with hochschild cohomology , but provide some details for the discussion of higher order and secondary hochschild cohomology .",
    "we also assume familiarity with simplicial sets .",
    "we follow the description in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is a commutative @xmath1-algebra and @xmath3 is a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule .",
    "let @xmath22 be a finite pointed set such that @xmath23 ( we identify it with @xmath24 with @xmath25 the fixed element ) and define @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "we define @xmath28 determined as follows : if @xmath29 then @xmath30 where @xmath31    take @xmath0 to be a pointed simplicial set .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 , we identify the set @xmath33 with @xmath34 then define @xmath35 for each @xmath36 we define @xmath37 and take @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 .",
    "the homology of this complex is denoted by @xmath4 and is called the higher order hochschild cohomology group .",
    "one interesting fact is that these groups depend only on the homotopy type of the geometric realization of the simplicial set @xmath0 .",
    "we recall the construction from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath1-algebra , @xmath6 a commutative @xmath1-algebra , @xmath14 a morphism of @xmath1-algebras such that @xmath40 and @xmath3 an @xmath2-bimodule that is @xmath6-symmetric .",
    "we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that for @xmath43 , we have : @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath48 is a complex .",
    "the homology of this complex is called the secondary hochschild cohomology and is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the homology and the cyclic version of this theory were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce a new cohomology associated to a simplicial pair @xmath12 and a triple @xmath8 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath6 are commutative @xmath1-algebra and @xmath50 is a morphism of @xmath1-algebras ) .",
    "we start with a few notations .",
    "we consider @xmath51 to be the category whose objects are pairs @xmath52 , where @xmath22 is a finite pointed set with base point @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a pointed subset of @xmath22 . a morphism @xmath55 is a map of pointed sets @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "the category of finite pointed sets @xmath58 can be see as a full subcategory of @xmath51 in two different ways .",
    "first we can take the inclusion given by @xmath59 , second we can take the inclusion @xmath60 .",
    "a @xmath51-module is a functor from @xmath61 to @xmath1-modules .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath6 be two commutative @xmath1-algebras , @xmath14 a morphism of @xmath1-algebras and @xmath3 a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule .",
    "we construct @xmath62 to be the @xmath51-module determined as follows .",
    "for @xmath63 such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 define @xmath66 if @xmath67 is a morphism in @xmath68 , we define @xmath69 for @xmath70 then    @xmath71 where for @xmath72 we have    @xmath73    and for @xmath74 we have @xmath75 with the convention that if the product is taken over the empty set then we put @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we say that a pair @xmath78 is a simplicial pair if @xmath79 is a simplicial set and @xmath80 a simplicial subset of @xmath79 .",
    "in other words we have a functor @xmath81    for a simplicial pair @xmath78 we define the higher order hochschild cohomology associated to the triple @xmath8 and a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule @xmath3 , to be the homology of the complex defined as follows . for every @xmath82 we consider @xmath83 and take @xmath84 .",
    "we construct a complex by taking the differential induced by the simplicial structure on @xmath85 .",
    "more precisely if @xmath86 then we define @xmath87 and take @xmath88 , @xmath89    the homology of the above complex is called the higher order hochschild cohomology associated to the simplicial pair @xmath78 , of the triple @xmath8 with coefficients in @xmath3 and is denoted by @xmath90 .    in the event that @xmath91",
    "this definition agrees with the definition of higher order hochschild cohomology @xmath92 .",
    "in this section we show that when @xmath2 is commutative and @xmath3 is a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule , then the secondary hochschild cohomology @xmath93 is a particular case of the construction from the previous section .",
    "consider the simplicial pair @xmath94 , where the sphere @xmath5 is a obtained from the interval @xmath95 $ ] by identifying the ends of the interval , and the disk @xmath96 is obtained from the @xmath97-simplex @xmath98 $ ] by collapsing the edges @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] ( i.e. the boundary of @xmath96 is the edge @xmath101 $ ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we take @xmath80 to be the simplicial set where the only nondegenerate @xmath102-simplex is @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath104 the base point in dimension @xmath105 , and by @xmath106 the simplex in dimension @xmath107 , where we iterate the @xmath108 $ ] vertex @xmath109 times , and the @xmath110 $ ] vertex @xmath111 times .",
    "for example , @xmath112 is the interval @xmath113 with @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is a @xmath97-simplex @xmath116 $ ] such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    for @xmath79 , besides the above simplices , we also have a nondegenerate @xmath97-simplex @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "denote it by @xmath119 and take @xmath120 and @xmath121 . more generally , take @xmath122 the @xmath123-dimensional simplex obtained by iterating the @xmath108 $ ] vertex @xmath109 times , the @xmath124 $ ] vertex @xmath111 times , and the @xmath110 $ ] vertex @xmath125 times .",
    "for example @xmath126 is a @xmath127-simplex @xmath128 $ ] with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "in general we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath134 are defined as follows : @xmath135",
    "@xmath136 @xmath137    notice that @xmath106 is degenerate if @xmath138 , and @xmath122 is degenerate if @xmath139 .",
    "also we have that @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "in particular we get that @xmath142 next we need to make the identification with the notation from @xcite .",
    "first recall that an element in @xmath143 was represented by a tensor matrix    @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath146 with @xmath147 the element @xmath148 corresponds to the position @xmath149 in the tensor matrix . for @xmath150 with @xmath151",
    "the element @xmath152 corresponds to the position @xmath153 in the tensor matrix .",
    "we also add the symbol @xmath154 to correspond to @xmath155 .    with the above identifications the formulas ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) become : @xmath156    @xmath157    if we use the above identification the formula for @xmath158 from equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "is the same as the formula for differential @xmath159 from equation ( [ delta ] ) . to summarize we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath6 be commutative @xmath1-algebras , @xmath14 a morphism of @xmath1-algebras and @xmath3 a symmetric @xmath2-bimodule , then we have @xmath160",
    "one can see that @xmath90 is functorial with respect to all of its entries .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath161 and @xmath162 be two triples , @xmath3 a symmetric @xmath163-bimodule , and @xmath164 a morphism of @xmath1-algebras such that @xmath165 and @xmath166 , then we have the natural morphism @xmath167 where the @xmath168-bimodule structure on @xmath3 is induced by @xmath169 .",
    "also , if @xmath170 is a morphism of symmetric @xmath2-bimodules then @xmath171    moreover if @xmath172 is a morphism of simplicial sets then @xmath173 if we take the natural inclusion of simplicial pairs @xmath174 with the simplicial structure discussed in the previous section , then @xmath175 is nothing else but the morphism @xmath176 discussed in @xcite .",
    "one natural question is whether the construction in this paper depends only of the homotopy type of the geometric realization of the simplicial pair @xmath177 ( or maybe invariant under a certain equivalence relation among simplicial pairs ) .",
    "we explored this problem but we were not able to prove any interesting result .",
    "the main issue is finding an equivalence relation among simplicial pairs that is manageable at the algebraic level .",
    "the authors would like to thank andrew salch for conversations and suggestions about this research .",
    "bruce would also like to thank his wife kendall for her continued support ."
