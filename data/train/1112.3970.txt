    "the most popular theoretical framework for coevolving active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galaxies invokes major mergers to fuel both starbursts and quasars @xcite .",
    "but there also exist secular processes which can grow agns in disks , through stochastic gas accretion and stellar mass loss @xcite or cold streams and disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "the relative dominance of these fueling modes may evolve : perhaps secular processes are efficient in the gas - rich @xmath0 universe but mergers are required to funnel gas to galaxy nuclei at @xmath1 , in a way analogous to star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations of agn host galaxy morphologies have the potential to distinguish secular processes from merger fueling .",
    "figure [ fig : mergerfrac ] shows examples of host morphology studies from x - ray agns at three different redshifts : @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4 @xcite . in each survey ,",
    "agns and mass - matched inactive galaxies are blindly classified by visual inspection . naively comparing the three results",
    "suggests evolution in the importance of merger fueling for agns , but each study is biased to selecting different kinds of agns .",
    "contrary to the classical unified model @xcite , recent work has shown that rapidly accreting quasars have very different fueling and feedback modes from weak agns @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite shows that broad - line quasars have strong radiative winds and luminous accretion disks , while weakly accreting narrow - line agns have radiatively inefficient accretion flows and radio - mode feedback .",
    "understanding agn - galaxy coevolution then requires studying host galaxy type across the two axes of agn accretion rate and obscuration . yet",
    "previous agn host studies ( including those shown in figure [ fig : mergerfrac ] ) have generally not distinguished between weakly accreting liners , compton - thick agns , and powerful quasars .    here",
    "we study host galaxy morphologies for 70 x - ray selected agns from the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ?",
    "these agns span three orders of magnitude in each of accretion rate and column density , and their observed data demonstrate that host galaxy type is connected to agn properties .",
    "we study agn and host properties for the 70 cosmos sources which have :    1 .",
    "xmm point source detections from @xcite , with @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 and @xmath7 x - ray counts for accurate @xmath8 estimates . 2 .",

    "rest - frame optical host galaxy morphologies from @xcite , restricted to @xmath10 agns with _",
    "imaging @xcite .",
    "the 70 agns include 5 broad - line , 38 narrow - line , and 27 optically dull agns .",
    "we parameterize agn accretion rate using the eddington ratio , @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite already estimated @xmath12 for unobscured ( @xmath13  @xmath14 ) agns in our sample , with @xmath15 from model fits to the multiwavelength seds and @xmath16 from broad emission lines ( when available ) or the @xmath17 relation . for obscured ( @xmath18  @xmath14 ) agns , we can not estimate @xmath15 in the same fashion because most of the sed is heavily extincted . instead we estimate @xmath15 using an infrared bolometric correction , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "note that for unobscured agns , this bolometric correction is roughly consistent with @xmath15 measured from the sed method .",
    "for all agns @xmath8 is estimated from the x - ray spectra , using either the xmm - cosmos data or the deeper _ chandra _ data @xcite when available .",
    "morphology measurements for the host galaxies of the 70 agns are presented by @xcite .",
    "briefly , _",
    "hst_/acs images were fit with galfit @xcite , using a point source component to describe the agn and a single @xcite function to describe the extended galaxy . for many of narrow - line and lineless agns ,",
    "a better fit was obtained without the point source component : for these systems we use the srsic - only fit of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the srsic index @xmath20 , @xcite also measure the asymmetry parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to group agn host galaxies into three categories : @xmath22 galaxies are disturbed , @xmath23 galaxies are spheroid - dominated , and @xmath24 galaxies are disks .",
    "figure [ fig : unifiedhost ] shows the host galaxy morphology with agn accretion rate and obscuration .",
    "each quadrant of the figure corresponds to a different preferred host type .",
    "all 5 of the broad - line agns , which have the highest accretion rates among unobscured ( @xmath13  @xmath14 ) agns , have spheroid - dominated hosts .",
    "weaker and obscured agns are frequently in disk galaxies , and hosts of obscured ( @xmath18  @xmath14 ) agns are more likely to be disturbed .",
    "the changes in host type with agn accretion rate and obscuration are consistent with merger - driven evolutionary models .",
    "for example , while weak agns might be fed by stochastic processes in disk galaxies @xcite , mergers drive obscured agns @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite suggest that quasar feedback eventually blows out the obscuring material , resulting in a post - merger spheroid with an unobscured quasar .",
    "however , we can not rule out steady - state agn fueling : it may simply be that disturbed systems have more obscuring material , and efficiently fueling an unobscured quasar requires a massive spheroid . in either case , our work is additional evidence for a strong connection between galaxy properties and the growth and obscuration of their supermassive black holes .",
