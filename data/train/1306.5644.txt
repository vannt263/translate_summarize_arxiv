    "it is well known that conformal symmetry of the qcd lagrangian imposes strong constraints on the leading - order ( lo ) correlation functions and operator renormalization , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review",
    ". a schematic structure of the perturbation theory for a generic quantity @xmath12 beyond the lo is usually conjectured to be @xmath13 where @xmath12 is the result in the formal conformal limit , obtained by setting the @xmath14-function to zero by hand .",
    "it is expected to have full symmetries of a conformally invariant theory .",
    "the extra term involving the @xmath14-function can be calculated separately and e.g. the leading contribution to @xmath15 can be evaluated very easily via quark bubble insertions .",
    "a prominent example is provided by the generalized crewther relation  @xcite between the bjorken sum rule in deep inelastic scattering and the total cross section of @xmath16 annihilation : the expected structure has been confirmed by direct calculations to the @xmath17 accuracy  @xcite .",
    "another important application concerns the evolution equation for meson distribution amplitudes and generalized parton distributions . as shown by d.  mller , off - diagonal terms of the anomalous dimension matrix of leading twist operators to the @xmath5-loop accuracy",
    "are determined by the special conformal transformation anomaly at one order less  @xcite .",
    "this approach was later used to calculate the complete two - loop mixing matrix for twist - two operators in qcd  @xcite , and derive the two - loop evolution kernels in momentum space for the generalized parton distributions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an alternative technique to study implications of conformal invariance and illustrate it on two examples : calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix in the @xmath6-symmetric @xmath7 theory in @xmath8 to the three - loop accuracy , and the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 theory in @xmath11 to the two - loop accuracy .",
    "the motivation for our study , apart from various phenomenological applications , is the following .",
    "first of all , we think that the calculations can be considerably simplified by going over to evolution equations for non - local light - ray operators in position space .",
    "in particular the intricate procedure for the restoration of the evolution kernels from local operators can be avoided .",
    "second , we want to make the separation of perturbation theory in `` conformal part '' and `` corrections proportional to the @xmath14-function '' as in eq .",
    "( [ conformal ] ) to be more transparent .",
    "our starting point is the observation that qcd and toy - model scalar theories that we consider for illustration possess a nontrivial fixed point in non - integer dimension , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "conformal symmetry is an _",
    "exact _ symmetry of the interacting theory for the fine - tuned ( critical ) value of coupling . as a consequence , the renormalization group equations are exactly conformally invariant : the evolution kernels commute with the generators of the conformal group .",
    "the generators are , however , modified by quantum corrections as compared to their canonical expressions , @xmath20 , and the corrections can be calculated order by order in the perturbative expansion . from the pure technical point of view",
    ", this calculation replaces evaluation of the conformal anomaly in the theory with broken symmetry in integer dimensions via the conformal word identities ( cwi ) in the approach of d.  mller .",
    "we show that the non - invariant part of the evolution equations with respect to canonical transformations in @xmath21th order of perturbation theory is uniquely fixed by the generators in the order @xmath4 , and the invariant part is determined ( and can be easily restored ) from the spectrum of anomalous dimensions .",
    "last but not least , in @xmath22-like schemes the evolution kernels ( anomalous dimensions ) do not depend on the space - time dimension by construction .",
    "thus all expressions derived in the @xmath23-dimensional ( conformal ) theory remain exactly the same for the theory in integer dimensions ; considering the theory at the critical point one does not lose any information .    as already mentioned , the present paper is exploratory .",
    "we work out the necessary formalism for the simplest , scalar field theories .",
    "we expect , however , that the same technique can be used in gauge theories and in particular in qcd .",
