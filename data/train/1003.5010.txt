    "globular clusters ( gcs ) represent the oldest stellar systems in the universe and therefore reflect the earliest evolutionary stages of the galaxy .",
    "although the galactic halo gc system appears homogeneous ( e.g. , cohen & melendez 2005 ; koch et al . 2009 ) and well compatible with the stellar halo in many regards ( e.g. , geisler et al . 2007 ) , numerous properties show broad differences between individual clusters and are at odds with halo field stars .",
    "these characteristics comprise anti - correlations of the light - elements ( o , na , al ; e.g. , gratton et al . 2004 ) and the `` second - parameter effect '' , which needs to explain discordant horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies at any given metallicity",
    ". suggested solutions to this problem include a broad age range in the gcs as well as variations in their helium content ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; buonanno et al .",

    "the space interferometry mission ( sim ) will take a step towards lifting such degeneracies by measuring accurate parallaxes ( to within @xmath3@xmath4as ) to numerous halo field stars and gcs .",
    "the resulting significant improvement in the population  ii distance scale will greatly reduce uncertainties in the estimated ages of the oldest systems in our galaxy ( shao 2004 ) .",
    "an improvement of the age determinations of globular clusters to @xmath35% requires , however , to measure absolute metallicities of the clusters with an accuracy better than 0.05 dex .",
    "the aforementioned problems are then resolvable through combining photometry , distance data and accurate spectroscopic measurements of metallicities and chemical abundance ratios .    here",
    "we present a chemical abundance study based on a set of high - resolution spectra of five red giants and one agb star in the nearby ( d@xmath5=8.1kpc ) galactic gc m5 ( @xmath6 ngc 5904 ) .",
    "previous works have established it as a moderately metal poor system ( at [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath7 dex ) with heavy element abundance ratios representative of the galactic halo ( e.g. , ivans et al .",
    "2001 ; ramrez & cohen 2003 ; kraft & ivans 2003 ; yong et al .",
    "2008a , b ) . while ivans et al . ( 2001 ) suggest that the anti - correlations between those elements affected by proton - capture nucleosynthesis in m5 are similar to those found in more metal poor gcs , ramrez & cohen ( 2003 ) could not confirm such a trend as they did not detect very low o - abundances .",
    "all studies to date confirm a low star - to - star scatter in the iron peak- and n - capture elements of stars over a wide range of luminosities and thus independent of evolutionary status .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath0-elements with the exception of a broader range in [ o / fe ] .",
    "the scope of the present work is not to repeat or supplement those comprehensive measurements of chemical element ratios that already exist in abundance in the literature , but to place m5 on a highly accurate new metallicity scale .",
    "the importance of settling a homogeneous gc abundance scale is exemplified by the aberrant values for m5 based on calcium triplet calibrations ( rutledge et al .",
    "1997 ) to the most commonly used metallicity scales of zinn & west ( 1984 ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) : for m5 , both estimates differ by ( 0.26@xmath80.06 ) dex .",
    "this is far inferior to the presently achievable accuracy of high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , high - resolution abundance studies in galactic stellar populations . in the first paper of this series ( koch & mcwilliam 2008 ; hereafter paper  i )",
    ", we initiated such a new gc scale by measuring chemical abundances in the gc 47  tuc differentially to the well - studied galactic k - giant arcturus ( e.g. , fulbright , mcwilliam & rich 2006 , 2007 ) . by means of a line - by - line differential analysis , uncertainties in the",
    "often poorly constrained atomic parameters ( @xmath9-values ) and dependencies on stellar atmospheres effectively cancel out to first order , therefore yielding absolute metallicities to better than 0.05 dex in [ fe / h ] .    in paper",
    "i it was shown that arcturus suffers from an ionization non - equilibrium with [ /]=@xmath100.08 dex ; the sense and extent of this deviation was , however , found to differ from the red giants of similar evolutionary status and atmospheric parameters in the gc 47  tuc . in order to understand the cause for such discrepancies ,",
    "be it systematic or a real , stellar evolutionary effect , it is crucial to understand whether this differential non - equilibrium is similarly present in other gcs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in 2 we present the data set and the standard reductions taken , while our atomic line list , stellar atmospheres are briefly introduced in 3 , where we also recapitulate our differential abundance analysis relative to arcturus .",

    "as was elaborated in paper i , resorting to systematic errors in mass , luminosity and/or t@xmath22 can in general explain the apparent over - ionization of iron in our m5 stars relative to arcturus , although the required changes are mostly unphysical .",
    "if stellar mass was the source of the discrepancy in surface gravity , our targets would need to have a mass of 0.46 m@xmath5 on average , which would require an extraordinary large mass - loss for these first ascent red giants ; this seems an undesirable option .",
    "if changes in log @xmath23 were due to luminosity effects , the distance modulus of m5 would have to be larger by 0.38 mag , i.e. , the gc would be more distant by at least 1.6 kpc , which is an unrealistic scenario , considering that this value lies 4@xmath30 above the mean , and 0.3 mag fainter than the largest value found in the literature ( gratton et al .",
    "likewise , the photometric accuracy given in sandquist & bolte ( 2004 ) is typically less than a few hundredth of a magnitude .",
    "moreover , the combined contributions of bc uncertainties ( at @xmath3@xmath31 mag ) and the published errors on the reddening of typically 0.01 mag amount to an overall luminosity - effect on log @xmath23 of no more than 0.06 dex which is clearly below the 0.25 dex change in gravity required to explain the observed lack of ionization equilibrium of iron .    since our color- and excitation temperatures , on our arcturus scale ,",
    "are in such excellent agreement , it seems inadequate to invoke changes in t@xmath22 as the source for the non - equilibrium .",
    "as it turns out , an increase in the temperatures of @xmath380 k on average would we able to resolve the ionization imbalance in our stars ( table  5 ) .",
    "this would , however , result in [ fe / h ] abundances higher by 0.06@xmath80.01 dex on average , which is larger than our typical random and systematic uncertainties ( see sect .",
    "moreover , an 80 k discrepancy can not be accounted for by an increase in the reddening , as such a difference would require an e(b@xmath10v ) of the order of 0.07 mag , which clearly provides a poor fit to the cmd and is twice as large as the values found in the literature . on the contrary , with a 9.510 gyr isochrone , the best fit to the cmd isochrone",
    "is achieved by lowering the reddening to 0.01 , which would rather reflect a lower temperature , thereby aggravating the ionization imbalance .",
    "these arguments confirm that temperature effects can be ruled out as the main driver of the non - equilibrium .    as another possible explanation we explored the sensitivity of the [ / ] ratio to the adopted @xmath0-enhancement in the atmospheres .",
    "switching from the opacity distributions with an [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratio of + 0.4 ( aodfnew ) to the scaled solar composition ( odfnew ) is well able to re - establish the ionization equilibrium in the cluster stars on average ( see also table  5 ) and we do in fact find that [ /]@xmath32 dex .",

    "with teramo isochrones interpolated to these parameters we found that only the 14 gyr isochrone was consistent with the photometry and distance modulus , to within the 1@xmath30 uncertainties . while a reduction in the oxygen abundance would improve matters slightly , the main source of uncertainty appears to be the distance modulus . for an age of 10 gyr",

    "differential non - lte abundance effects between arcturus and m5 giants is a potential source for the observed ionization imbalance .",
    "qualitatively , we expect the more metal - poor , more luminous , m5 stars to suffer greater non - lte over - ionization of neutrals than arcturus because the m5 giant atmospheres are more transparent to ionizing uv radiation and they experience fewer atomic collisions .",

    "( 2007 ) . on the other hand , since the ionization potential of fe  i is significantly higher than for ti  i one would expect the non - lte over - ionization correction for ti to exceed that of fe .",
    "it is conceivable that the lack of ionization equilibrium can be explained by an anomalous he content of the m5 giants : recall that one ( though unlikely ) reason for the departure from this equilibrium in arcturus was hypothesized to be an unusually high he mass fraction ( @xmath37=0.40 ) relative to the standard mixture in the 47  tuc giants .",
    "although we refrain from any quantitative arguments , we briefly note that the opposite sense of the ionization imbalance in m5 relative to the 47  tuc stars purports that m5 is rather similar to arcturus in that this cluster may also exhibit an elevated y. sandquist & bolte ( 2004 ) find that the number ratio of agb to hb stars , @xmath38 , which reflects the helium abundance in the convection layers of the stars , is higher than found in any other gc ( at 0.176 ) and than predicted by stellar evolution theories ( e.g. , renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; cassisi et al . 2003 ) . on the other hand , the number ratio of hb to rgb stars ,",

    "it is possible that this is due to non - lte over - ionization of ti  i. we note that this @xmath30.10 dex enhancement in the [ ca / ti ] abundance ratio would be reduced to @xmath30.03 dex assuming the presumed ti  i non - lte correction of 0.07 dex required to obtain ionization equilibrium ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "qualitatively , however , the non - lte correction should be smaller for fe  i than for ti  i , due to the higher ionization potential of fe  i ( 7.90ev versus 6.83 ev ) . that we measure the same ionization equilibrium deficit for ti and fe suggests that the continuum formation is more likely the source than non - lte , in which case the @xmath30.10 dex [ ca / ti ] enhancement is probably real .",

    "this holds for the observed [ mg / si ] ratios as well , which are compatible with zero in our m5 stars ( at a mean and 1@xmath30 scatter of 0.02@xmath80.07 dex ) .",
    "the oxygen abundances are solely based on the [ ] 6300  line that we carefully deblended from telluric absorption .",
    "the transition at 6363  is generally too weak in our spectra and further affected by a ca auto - ionization feature .",
    "for the 6300 [ o  i ] line we assign an upper limit of the uncertainty on the derived [ o / fe ] ratio of 0.10 dex .",
    "the final values for the five stars in common deviate from the literature values by 0.15 dex on average , with a 1@xmath30 scatter of 0.15 dex .",
    "most authors performed profile matching , while our values rely on ew measurements .",
    "given the good agreement of the gravities between all studies in question , and considering the order of magnitude of the change in the o / fe ratio under log@xmath23 variations ( table  5 ) , it is unlikely that all of the deviation in [ o / fe ] is due to the adopted gravity scales .",
    "the oscillator strengths for the o - lines employed in the comparison data all agree to within better than 0.05 dex , which leads to differences in [ o / fe ] of 0.04 dex at most ( although we note that ramrez & cohen 2003 used in addition the 7771 - triplet ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the deviation of our abundances from those in the literature are a consequence of the fundamentally different , to wit differential , analysis method of this work .",
    "the na abundances for our stars were derived from the ews of the 6154  doublet only ( cf . ivans et al .",
    "the strong lines at 5682 , 5688  are heavily blended with other metal lines and in the present , truly differential , ew study we wish to avoid any dependence on spectral syntheses that would resolve such blends .",
    "we find a mean [ na / fe ] of 0.19@xmath80.07 dex , which agrees well with the literature measurements . while our sodium abundances do not deviate by more than 0.03 dex from the values of ivans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , our [ na / fe ] for star m5iv-82 is higher by 0.16 ( 0.11 ) dex than stated by ramrez & cohen ( 2003 ) and yong et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , respectively ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "all of these authors have included the strong na - d lines in their computations so that the observed difference in [ na / fe ] might be due to our removal of this feature from our line list .",
    "on the other hand , this star is also characterized by a [ na / fe ] ratio that is lower than the cluster mean by 0.4 dex ( 2.4@xmath30 ) .",
    "this finding is , however , consistent with the high oxygen abundance of this star , which leads to a distinctly low [ na / o ] ratio , see fig .",
    "6 .        in this figure",
    ", we illustrate the well - defined na - o anti - correlation found in gc stars ( e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2004 ; carretta et al . 2009b",
    ", c ) , in comparison with the galactic stars also indicated in fig .  5 . while the halo distribution does not show any na - o relations , m5 follows very closely the trend outlined by the galactic halo clusters , which is in accord with the finding of ivans et al .",
    "in particular , we can assign our star m5iv-82 to the first - generation , `` primordial '' component that shows ( low ) na and ( high ) o abundances similar to the halo field stars and therefore abundance patterns that are consistent with sn nucleosynthesis ( carretta et al .",
    "2009b ) , while the remainder shows the elevated [ na / fe ] ratios and lower o - abundances typical of the material processed through proton capture nucleosynthesis in the second generation of the cluster stars .",
    "aluminum abundance ratios in our stars were measured from four relatively weak ( 2040 m ) lines , around 6696 and 7835 . as a result , we see evidence for a broad range in the al / fe ratio of about 0.5 dex . in fig .",
    "7 we parallel the mg / al correlation with the na - o anti - correlation discussed above . as",
    "before , it is evident that m5iv-82 , having the highest mg / al ratio in our sample , reflects the original , chemically unprocessed composition of m5 .",
    "therefore , our _ differential abundances _ confirm the occurrence of star - to - star variations in the light elements due to the canonical proton - capture synthesis processes seen in other metal poor galactic halo gcs .",
    "here we have determined chemical abundance ratios in five red giants and one agb star in the moderately metal poor galactic halo globular cluster m  5 .",
    "one major improvement of our measurements of iron , na and al , and the @xmath0-element - to - iron ratios ( o , mg , si , ca , ti / fe ) compared to previous works on this well - studied gc is the _ differential _ line - by - line abundance relative to a reference star of similar stellar parameters , to wit , arcturus . as a consequence ,",
    "inevitable uncertainties in the model atmospheres and potentially erroneous atomic data were efficiently reduced , by which we could attain a high degree of accuracy of our abundance results .",
    "mean lte [ fe / h ] of @xmath1@xmath2 dex is fully consistent with recent results in the literature , while a number of the @xmath0-element ratios we find are higher by @xmath30.04 dex on average than literature values owing to the different analysis techniques employed in each of the sources . at first glance",
    "this may seem to imply that log@xmath9-based abundances can provide an equally well suited abundances scale .",
    "we point out , however , that the discrepancies between the differential and absolute values found for 47  tuc ( paper  i ) indicate that such an agreement is not necessarily generally granted so that any such comparison of gc abundance scales must be considered on a case - by - case basis .",
    "following our accurate new measurements for the metal rich gc 47  tuc in paper  i , the present study is the second step towards an accurate differential abundance scale for galactic gcs , which will enable future age dating to an unprecedented precision and establish m5 as a template of moderately metal poor clusters .",
    "the necessity for an accurate age determination is underscored by the use of m5 as a cmd template for characterizing faint , remote , systems for which hardly any spectroscopic information is achievable ( cf .",
    "koch et al . 2009 ) . in this context ,",
    "stetson et al . ( 1999 ) argue that m5 should be younger than the old halo cluster m3 by @xmath31 gyr , while vandenberg ( 2000 ) finds m5 `` to be slightly older than most clusters having similar metallicities '' .    while the explosive @xmath0-elements si and ca trace each other , confirming their origin in explosive nucleosynthesis , the [ ca / ti ] ratio is higher than in the galactic halo ; m5 s solar [ mg / ca ] ratio then indicates that the chemical enrichement history of the m5 material is consistent with a normal mix of sn progenitor masses .",
    "our data show clear evidence of a na - o anti - correlation , as well as a broad range of al abundances , all of which implies the occurrence of proton capture processes in the cluster stars .",
    "one star of our sample , however , represents the primordial , unprocessed composition of a first generation of stars .",
    "all other @xmath0-elements ( mg , si , ca , and ti ) show only little star - to - star ( 1@xmath30 ) scatter ( of the order of 0.050.07 dex , compared to 0.16 and 0.21 dex for na and o , respectively ) that is compatible with the measurement errors .",
    "this finding is in agreement with carretta et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , who report a very low r.m.s .",
    "scatter in their iron abundances , and which bolsters that this system has formed and evolved in a chemically homogeneous environment .",
    "its kinematics indicates that m5 spends 90% of its orbit at galactocentric distances outside of 10 kpc ( dinescu et al .",
    "1999 ) and it comes as little surprise that , all in all , this cluster overlaps with the canonical trends delineated by galactic halo field and gc stars at the same metallicity so that it can be considered a typical ( present - day ) inner halo cluster ( cf .",
