    "a bulk equilibrium fluid is translationally invariant ; i.e. , its one - particle density , @xmath0 , is constant . nonetheless , assuming spherically - symmetric interactions , the local density @xmath1 surrounding a reference particle is a function of distance  @xmath2 from its center , where @xmath3 is the radial distribution function ( rdf ) of the fluid.@xcite although the rdf depends on both the form of the interparticle interactions and the thermodynamic state , some features of its shape are fairly general .",
    "for example , the rdf vanishes for @xmath2 less than the effective exclusion diameter of the particles . for larger @xmath2",
    ", it shows an oscillatory decay toward unity with peaks loosely corresponding to coordination `` shells '' .",
    "away from the critical point , the structure of the rdf typically persists for distances comparable to a few particle diameters , reflecting the short range of the interparticle correlations .",
    "studies of the liquid state have primarily focused on the particles in the first coordination shell .",
    "this is due in part to the important role that nearest neighbors are expected to play in determining many physicochemical properties .",
    "for example , both the non - ideal contribution to the equation of state of the hard - sphere fluid ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and",
    "the collision frequency in enskog theories for transport processes@xcite scale with the `` contact '' density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle diameter .",
    "the hard - sphere equation of state is the standard reference system for perturbation theories.@xcite it also accurately predicts how the thermodynamics of `` hard - sphere '' colloidal suspensions relate to their structure , as has recently been experimentally verified by confocal microscopy.@xcite furthermore , analysis of first - shell contributions to hydration structure and thermodynamics helps to understand and make predictions about a wide variety of aqueous solution properties.@xcite    although the second shell of the rdf has received comparatively less attention , there is evidence that it also contains structural information relevant for understanding nontrivial behaviors of liquids .",
    "one notable feature is the shoulder@xcite that it develops near the freezing transition , which in turn becomes a pronounced split peak@xcite in supercooled liquid and glassy states .",
    "analysis of the configurations that give rise to this structural motif indicate that it reflects frustration of icosahedral@xcite and emerging crystalline@xcite order in the fluid .",
    "understanding how these these types of structural features connect to relaxation processes of supercooled liquids is an active area of research ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .    in this work , however , we focus on the second and higher coordination shells of the rdf for a different reason : to understand their role in the _ structural anomalies _ of fluids .",
    "interparticle correlations of most fluids are enhanced upon ( i ) compression or ( ii ) cooling ( alternatively , strengthening of interparticle attractions ) . nonetheless , there are a few systems of scientific interest that exhibit notably different behaviors . for example",
    ", compression induced disordering occurs in water and other fluids with anomalous waterlike trends in their thermodynamic and transport properties.@xcite cooling ( or attraction ) induced disordering , on the other hand , can occur in fluids of particles with short - range attractive ( sra ) interactions,@xcite such as concentrated suspensions of colloids .",
    "these anomalies do not appear to be first - shell effects .",
    "rather , they reflect how structuring in second and more distant coordination shells responds to changes in thermodynamic or system parameters .",
    "for example , yan _",
    "et al._@xcite recently demonstrated in an insightful paper how the structural anomaly of the five - site transferable interaction potential ( tip5p ) model@xcite for water is quantitatively related to compression induced translational disordering of molecules in the second coordination shell .",
    "similarly , krekelberg _",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that the cooling ( or attraction ) induced structural anomaly of a square - well sra fluid is due to weakening of second- and higher - shell pair correlations .",
    "the goal here is to study the generality of the above findings .",
    "it is known that a number of models , with varying levels of molecular resolution , can qualitatively predict the structural anomalies of the aforementioned systems .",
    "@xcite but do the anomalies exhibited by lower resolution models have the same microscopic origins as those of more detailed models ? moreover , can the behavior of the lower resolution models be predicted , at least qualitatively , by integral equation theory ?",
    "if so , it would suggest that integral equation theory might serve as a valuable first - pass tool in assessing , based on the pair potential alone , whether new model systems might be good candidates for exhibiting structural anomalies .",
    "furthermore , although the structurally anomalous trends analyzed here are interesting in their own right , there is a more compelling reason to try to understand their origins . in short ,",
    "they appear to be closely linked to other distinctive dynamic and thermodynamic behaviors .",
    "for example , in addition to being `` structurally anomalous '' , cold liquid water is also `` dynamically anomalous '' in that its self - diffusivity increases upon isothermal compression and `` thermodynamically anomalous '' in that its volume increases upon isobaric cooling .",
    "errington and debenedetti@xcite first noticed that these particular anomalies form a cascade in the temperature - density plane for the extended simple point charge ( spc / e ) model@xcite of water.@xcite specifically , the thermodynamic anomaly occurs only for state points that also exhibit the dynamic anomaly .",
    "the dynamic anomaly , in turn , is only present for states that also exhibit the structural anomaly .",
    "strong correlations between these three basic types of anomalies have since been documented for a wide variety of model systems with waterlike properties.@xcite    a similar connection between structural and dynamic anomalies has now also been identified for model sra fluids.@xcite in those systems , the most commonly studied dynamic anomaly is an _ increase _ in self - diffusivity upon cooling ( or strengthening of interparticle attractions ) , which can occur at sufficiently high particle concentrations.@xcite krekelberg _",
    "et al._@xcite discovered that the self - diffusivity anomaly for a square - well sra fluid occurs only for state points that also exhibit the cooling ( or attraction ) induced structural anomaly discussed above . in other words , it appears that sra fluids can also display a cascade of anomalies qualitatively similar to those of waterlike fluids .",
    "although structural and dynamic properties of these systems show unusual dependencies on quantities like temperature or density , the correlations between structure and dynamics are often similar to those found in simpler liquids ( e.g. , the hard - sphere fluid).@xcite in fact , it was recently demonstrated@xcite that the cascade of anomalies of one waterlike model system can be semi - quantitatively predicted based only on knowledge of the state dependencies of excess entropy , which measures structural order,@xcite and quasi - universal excess entropy scalings@xcite for the transport coefficients .",
    "all of this suggests that investigations like the present one , which probe the physics of structural anomalies , might also provide insights into dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies as well .",
    "we used molecular dynamics simulation and integral equation theory to examine various models from two classes of fluids known to exhibit structural anomalies : those with waterlike properties and those comprising particles with sra interactions . for the integral equation theory analysis",
    ", we numerically solved the ornstein - zernike equation@xcite together with an approximate closure relation using the method of labik _ _ et al.__@xcite in the discussion of the models below , we mention the specific closures employed and provide further details about the molecular simulations .",
    "we did not perform a systematic study here to determine which of many possible closure relations@xcite provides the most quantitatively accurate description for each model . rather , our focus was to explore whether integral equation theory solved with standard closure relations , such as percus - yevick ( py)@xcite or hypernetted - chain ( hnc)@xcite , can in fact qualitatively predict both the structural anomalies and their microscopic origins in the rdf .",
    "molecular simulations of the model systems provide the data necessary to make that basic determination .",
    "we investigated two waterlike models : ( 1 ) the spc / e @xcite model and ( 2 ) a lower resolution `` core - softened '' @xcite model .",
    "we chose the spc / e model because it represents one of the most commonly studied effective pair potentials for water , and it is known to qualitatively reproduce many of water s distinctive thermodynamic , dynamic , and structural properties.@xcite as a result , it provides a reasonable baseline against which to compare simpler , lower resolution models .",
    "details of our molecular dynamics simulations of the spc / e model are the same as reported in ref .  .",
    "the core - softened model@xcite that we studied is more schematic .",
    "it is defined by the effective pair potential @xmath6 [ see figure  [ fig : cs_potential](a ) ] , @xmath7    + 5\\epsilon\\rm{exp}\\biggl[-\\biggl(\\left[\\frac{r}{\\sigma}\\right]-0.7\\biggr)^2\\biggr],\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the characteristic energy scale . the main idea behind",
    "this potential is that it has two different kinds of repulsions that act at different length scales .",
    "the harsh @xmath9 repulsion defines the effective hard - core diameter ( @xmath5 ) , while the softer gaussian repulsion extends to considerably larger distances .",
    "the end result is that the average interparticle separation , and hence the density , of this fluid can depend sensitively on both temperature and pressure .",
    "the model is similar to cold water in that it favors locally open ( low - density ) structures at moderate pressure and low temperature , but can collapse to denser structures when compressed or heated enough to overcome the soft gaussian repulsion .",
    "although this low resolution model does not provide an accurate molecular - level description of water , it does qualitatively reproduce many of its peculiar thermodynamic , structural , and kinetic behaviors.@xcite    to compute the properties of the core - softened model , we performed molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical ensemble using @xmath10 identical particles of mass @xmath11 .",
    "we used the velocity - verlet technique for integrating the equations of motion with a time step of @xmath12 . for the integral equation theory analysis , we employed the hnc closure .",
    "we chose the hnc approximation because of its ability to describe the structure of another fluid with a soft gaussian repulsion , the gaussian - core model.@xcite we investigated both the spc / e and core - softened models over a wide range of density and temperature , where they are known to exhibit structural anomalies.@xcite     [ see eq .  ] .",

    "in the original study , a weakly polydisperse system was investigated . here , all particles considered had identical radius @xmath24 and mass @xmath11 .",
    "the advantage of focusing on a monodisperse system is that the pair correlations are unambiguously described by a single rdf , which facilitates the analysis discussed in the next section . for the integral equation theory of this sra fluid , we employed the py closure .",

    "[ fig : spce_s2fig](c ) , the changes come primarily from the second shell .",

    ". inspection of @xmath29 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spce_s2fig](e ) ] confirms that the decrease in structural ordering is almost entirely due to reduced correlations between the central and second - shell molecules .",
    "in fact , yan _",
    "et al . _ convincingly demonstrated that a similar structural anomaly in tip5p water can also be attributed to compression induced translational disordering of the second shell.@xcite    can these structural changes explain water s self - diffusity anomaly ?",
    "et al._@xcite argued , based on molecular simulation results , that the presence of a fifth molecule in the first coordination shell significantly lowers the barriers for translational and rotational motions of the central water molecule .",

    "[ eq : core_softened_potential ] responds to changes in density .",

    "one striking feature of the data is that the behavior of @xmath25 as a function of reduced density @xmath74 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ramp_sim_s2fig](a ) , is qualitatively similar to that of spc / e water [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : spce_s2fig](a ) ]",
    ". specifically , the core - softened model also displays @xmath28-structural anomalies over the density range @xmath75 that become more pronounced at lower temperature .",
    "clearly , the core - softened model is very different from the spc / e model in that the former does not provide a molecular description of water , and thus it does not favor the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated hydrogen - bond networks , etc .",
    "nonetheless , as we explain below , the main `` microscopic '' origins of its density - dependent trends in structural order are basically the same as those for the spc / e model .    in order to appreciate the similarity between these two models , it is helpful to first notice one difference . in the spc / e model ,",
    "the attractive `` hydrogen - bond '' interactions promote the formation of a first coordination shell , even at relatively low density .",
    "in contrast , since there are no attractions in the core - softened model , the gaussian repulsion prevents the `` first '' coordination shell ( near the hard - core diameter , @xmath76 ) from forming until sufficiently high density ( @xmath77 ) . on the other hand , the `` second '' coordination shell ( against the gaussian repulsion , @xmath78 ) is present even at low density .    from a qualitative perspective",
    ", one might consider each core - softened particle as effectively representing a cluster of water molecules ( e.g. , a central water molecule and its four nearest neighbors).@xcite in fact , yan _ et al .",
    "_ have recently presented evidence that a mapping of this sort has quantitative merit when one compares , in appropriately reduced form , the behaviors of a core - softened ramp model to tip5p water.@xcite when viewed from this perspective , the formation of the first shell in the core - softened model at high density qualitatively corresponds , in the molecular picture , to _ additional _ water molecules ( 5 , 6 , etc . ) penetrating the first shell of an otherwise four - coordinated central water molecule .",
    "once this physical relationship between the two models is recognized , the similarities between their structural properties are easy to understand .",
    "to illustrate this , we carried out a structural analysis of the core - softened model identical to that presented above for the spc / e model .",
