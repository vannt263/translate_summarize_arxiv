    "the skyrme model @xcite is a model for pions in the low - energy effective theory of qcd .",
    "the model is a four - dimensional non - linear sigma model whose target space is @xmath2 , and compound of the fourth order dervative term in addition to the canonical kinetic term .",
    "the fourth order derivative term guarantees the stability of solitons of co - dimension three , which are called skyrmions .",
    "the skyrmions are characterized by the homotopy class @xmath3 and they are regarded as baryons .",
    "the energy functional of the skyrme model has the bogomolnyi bound given by the topological charge associated with the homotopy .",
    "this topological charge is identified with the baryon number .",
    "however , no analytic solutions that saturate the lower bound of the energy have been found so far .",
    "there have only been obtained the numerical solutions of skyrmions , which indeed exceed the energy bound .",
    "this reflects the fact that the original four dimensional skyrme model does not have the bps property .",
    "finding proper solutions of skyrmions is a long standing problem .",
    "there are several directions to construct solutions .",
    "for example , the rational map ansatz provides a good approximation to the skyrmion solutions @xcite .",
    "this includes solutions corresponding to higher baryon numbers . although they can not saturate the energy bound , the rational map solutions have close energies to the normalized baryon charges",
    "alternatively , there is another promising approach to skyrmions known as the atiyah - manton construction @xcite .",
    "atiyah and manton pointed out that the holonomy of the yang - mills instantons in the four - dimensional euclid space gives a well approximated static skyrmion solutions .",
    "although , the origin of this approximation is not transparent , a physical interpretation to the atiyah - manton construction of skyrmions was discussed in @xcite .    even though the skyrmion solutions are well - approximated by instantons , they never saturate the bogomolnyi bound of the energy . in order to understand the obscure connection between the yang - mills instantons and skyrmions , we need further penetrating analysis . in this context , in @xcite , inspired by a holographic qcd model @xcite , it is proposed a systematic derivation of the energy functional for the static skyrme field from the yang - mills action in four dimensions . in the derivation ,",
    "the introduction of the tower of mesons originated from the kaluza - klein - like expansion modes in higher dimensions makes the atiyah - manton solution have closer energy to the bound @xcite .",
    "therefore , including the higher expansion modes in the atiyah - manton solution leads to the better approximation to the skyrmions .",
    "moreover , this relation is generalized to lower dimensions .",
    "for example , an analogue of the atiyah - manton construction in two dimensions is proposed @xcite where the sine - gordon soliton solution in one dimensions is well - approximated by the @xmath4-lump  the two - dimensional instantons .",

    "we study the relation between instantons and skyrmions in higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , we focus on the eight - dimensional self - dual instantons that satisfy @xmath0 .",
    "the self - duality relation is obtained by the bogomolnyi completion of the quartic yang - mills action in eight dimensions .",
    "we will derive the energy functional for the static skyrme field from the quartic yang - mills action by the reduction procedure developed by sutcliffe @xcite .",
    "the derrick s theorem indicates that the model admits static soliton solutions which we call the eight - dimensional skyrmions .",
    "we will find the numerical solution of the above mentioned skyrmion .",
    "we will then calculate a field configuration through the atiyah - manton construction applied to the eight - dimensional instanton and find that this gives a good approximation to the numerical solution of the skyrmion .",

    "again , the derrick s theorem implies that there is a static soliton solution that extremizes the energy .",
    "this is nothing but the skyrmion in @xmath16 dimensions . finding the explicit solutions need the numerical analysis in each dimension .",
    "we can also calculate the holonomy for the 1-instanton solution in @xmath16 dimensions and derive the static energy @xmath193 .",
    "although we do not repeat the same calculations , the result of the original atiyah - manton construction in four dimensions and our result in eight dimensions strongly suggest that this instanton / skyrmion correspondence does hold in @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "in this paper we studied the atiyah - manton construction of skyrmions in eight dimensions . following the formalism developed in @xcite",
    ", we derive the static energy functional for the skyrme field from the quartic yang - mills action in eight dimensions .",
    "the derrick s theorem indicates that there exist stable soliton solutions .",
    "the solutions are classified by the topological charge @xmath194 $ ] which is the eight - dimensional generalization of the baryon number . assuming the spherically symmetric hedgehog ansatz",
    ", we derive the equation of motion for the skyrme field .",
    "although the equation is quite nonlinear and complicated , we can perform the numerical analysis to find solutions .",
    "we present the explicit numerical solution for the skyrmion associated with the topological charge @xmath195 .",
    "the profile function and the energy density of the eight - dimensional skyrmion look quite similar to those in four dimensions .    in the latter part of the paper , we study the relation between the eight - dimensional instantons and the skyrmions . this is a generalization of the atiyah - manton construction in four - dimensions .",
    "following the four - dimensional case , we constructed the atiyah - manton solution for the skyrmion from the one instanton solution found in @xcite .",
    "we then compare the numerical solution and the atiyah - manton solution and find that there is a good agreement between them .",
    "the profile function looks quite similar in these solutions .",
    "this result dictates us that the correspondence between the instantons and the skyrmions by the atiyah - manton construction is an universal property in higher dimensions .",
    "indeed , we have confirmed that the sutcliffe s truncation of the higher dimensional generalization of the quartic yang - mills action gives the energy functional @xmath196 for the static skyrme field in @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "the structure of @xmath196 together with the derrick s theorem implies that there are stable skyrmion solutions in @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "since it is easy to show that the one - instantons in @xmath16 dimensions are given by the t hooft type , we can easily write down the atiyah - manton solution in each dimension .",
    "although it is hard to compute the explicit energy functional for the @xmath16-dimensional skyrme model , we expect the atiyah - manton solution provides a good approximation to the skyrmions .",
    "our study exhibits a deep relation between yang - mills instantons and skyrmions .",
    "physical interpretations of the atiyah - manton construction in lower dimensions are studied intensively @xcite .",
    "analogous relations among various solitons are expected in higher dimensions . meanwhile",
    ", supersymmetry play an important role to study the bps nature of classical solutions . among other things , supersymmetric generalizations of skyrme model in four dimensions",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to supersymmetrize the eight dimensional skyrme model presented in this paper .",
    "there are various related studies .",
    "it is known that skyrmions and monopoles have similar structures through the rational map ansatz .",
    "one can expect that this relation holds even in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , we know that only the numerical solutions of monopoles in seven dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the nahm construction of monopoles @xcite to find analytic solutions in seven dimensions .",
    "these expectations may be based on the integrable structure of the self - duality equations .",
    "it is known that the self - duality equation in four dimensions are reduced to integrable equations in lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to study the integrable structure of the self - duality equations in @xmath16 dimensions and generalization of the ward s conjecture @xcite",
