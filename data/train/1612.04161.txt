    "the transport of fluid mixtures in porous media has many important industrial applications like oil and gas extraction , dispersion of contaminants in underground water reservoirs , nuclear waste storage , and carbon sequestration .",
    "although there are many papers on the modeling and numerical solution of such compositional models @xcite , there are no results on their mathematical analysis . in this paper , we provide an existence analysis for a single - phase compositional model with van der waals pressure in an isothermal setting . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the model consists of strongly coupled degenerate parabolic equations for the mass densities .",
    "the cross - diffusion coupling and the hypocoercive diffusion operator constitute the main difficulty of the analysis .",
    "our analysis is a continuation of the program of the first and third author to develop a theory for cross - diffusion equations possessing an entropy ( here : free energy ) structure @xcite .",
    "the mathematical novelties are the complex structure of the equations and the observation that the solution of the binary model , for specific diffusion matrices , satisfies an unexpected integral inequality giving rise to a minimum principle , which generally does not hold for strongly coupled diffusion systems .",
    "more specifically , we consider an isothermal fluid mixture of @xmath0 mass densities @xmath1 in a domain @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , whose evolution is governed by the transport equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the van der waals pressure @xmath6 and the chemical potentials @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 these expressions are well defined if @xmath9 a.e . , where @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the total mass density and @xmath12 is a ( small ) parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 measures the attraction between the @xmath14th and @xmath15th species , and @xmath16 is a measure of the size of the molecules .",
    "the diffusion matrix @xmath17 is assumed to be symmetric and positive semidefinite .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the following bound holds : @xmath18 for some @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the projection on the subspace of @xmath22 orthogonal to @xmath23 . a property like is known in the literature as _ hypocoercivity _ , that is , coercivity on a subspace of the considered vector space . in our case , the matrix @xmath24 in is coercive on the orthogonal complement of the subspace generated by @xmath25 .",
    "bound is justified in the derivation of model - , as the diffusion fluxes @xmath26 must sum up to zero ( see section  [ sec.model ] ) .",
    "equation is the van der waals equation of state for mixtures , taking into account the finite size of the molecules .",
    "equations - are derived from the helmholtz free energy @xmath27 of the mixture ; see below . for details of the modeling and the underlying assumptions",

    "we impose the boundary and initial conditions @xmath28 note that we choose equilibrium boundary conditions",
    ". a physically more realistic choice would be to assume that the reservoir boundary is impermeable , leading to no - flux boundary conditions .",
    "however , conditions are needed to obtain sobolev estimates , together with the energy inequality below .",
    "numerical examples for homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for the pressure in case @xmath29 are presented in section [ sec.num ] .",
    "up to our knowledge , there are no analytical results for system - and . in the literature , euler and",
    "navier - stokes models were considered with van der waals pressure .",
    "for instance , the existence of global classical solutions to the corresponding euler equations with small initial data was shown in @xcite .",
    "the existence of traveling waves in one - dimensional navier - stokes with capillarity was studied in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the existence and stability of shock fronts in the vanishing viscosity limit for navier - stokes equations with van der waals type equations of state was established .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that the gibbs - duhem relation @xmath30 holds .",

    "the matrix @xmath33 is of rank one with two eigenvalues , a positive one and the other one equal to zero ( with algebraic multiplicity @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath29 , system is not parabolic in the sense of petrovski @xcite , and an existence theory for such diffusion systems is highly nontrivial , which is the _ first difficulty_. the property on the eigenvalues is reflected in the energy estimate . indeed , a formal computation , made rigorous below , shows that @xmath35 in case @xmath29 we obtain only one gradient estimate for @xmath36 which is not sufficient for the analysis .",
    "there exist some results for so - called strongly degenerate parabolic equations ( for which the diffusion matrix vanishes in some subset of positive @xmath37-dimensional measure ) @xcite .",
    "however , the techniques can not be applied to the present problem .",

    "the behavior of the solutions for @xmath29 are studied numerically in section [ sec.num ] .",
    "the _ second difficulty _ is the invertibility of the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e.  to define for given @xmath41 the mass density vector @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is defined by . a key ingredient for the proof is the positive definiteness of the hessian @xmath45 of the free energy since @xmath46 .",
    "this is only possible under a smallness condition on the eigenvalues of @xmath47 ; see lemma [ lem.hess ] .",
    "this condition is not surprising since it just means that phase separation is prohibited .",
    "the analysis of multiphase flows requires completely different mathematical techniques ; see , e.g. , @xcite for phase transitions in euler equations with van der waals pressure .",
    "the _ third difficulty _ is the proof of @xmath48 a.e .",
    "this property is needed to define @xmath36 and @xmath32 through - , but generally a maximum principle can not be applied to the strongly coupled system .",
    "the idea is to employ the boundedness - by - entropy method as in @xcite , i.e.  to work with the entropy variables @xmath49 .",
    "we show first the existence of weak solutions @xmath43 to a regularized version of , define @xmath42 and perform the de - regularization limit to obtain the existence of a weak solution @xmath40 to . since @xmath50 a.e .  by definition of @xmath51",

    "since it is difficult to relate the free energy @xmath69 and its energy dissipation @xmath70 , we can not prove an exponential decay rate although numerical experiments in @xcite and section [ sec.num ] indicate that this is the case even when @xmath29 . instead",
    ", we show for the relative energy @xmath71 that , for some constant @xmath64 and some nonnegative function @xmath72 , @xmath73 from which we deduce that the convergence is of order @xmath74 as @xmath75 .",
    "since the free energy is strictly convex , by lemma [ lem.hess ] below , we obtain convergence in the @xmath76 norm .      if @xmath29 , we obtain only a gradient estimate for @xmath36 .",
    "this lack of parabolicity is compensated by the following  surprising  integral identity , @xmath77 for arbitrary functions @xmath78 ; see the appendix for a formal proof .",
    "this means that there exists a family of conserved quantities depending on a function of @xmath34 variables .",
    "it is unclear whether this identity is sufficient to perform the limit @xmath79 and to prove the existence of a solution to with @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath12 , the integral identity does not hold in general .",

    "the evolution of the one - dimensional mass densities and the pressure are illustrated numerically in section [ sec.num ] for the case @xmath29 .",

    "we consider the isothermal flow of @xmath0 chemical components in a porous domain @xmath2 with porosity @xmath117 .",

    "moreover , we set @xmath121 to simplify the mathematical analysis .",
    "our results will be also valid for ( smooth ) space - dependent porosities .",

    "the third assumption is that the fluid is in a single state , i.e. , no phase - splitting occurs .",
    "mathematically , this means that the free energy must be convex .",
    "this is the case if the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath47 is sufficiently small ; see lemma [ lem.hess ] .",
    "the single - state assumption is restrictive from a physical viewpoint .",
    "it may be overcome by considering the transport equations for each phase separately and imposing suitable boundary conditions at the interface ( * ? ? ?",
