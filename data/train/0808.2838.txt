    "the central frequencies of solar acoustic modes , which are obtained using spherical harmonic decomposition , have been successfully used to determine the solar interior structure to as close as 21 mm to the solar surface ( @xmath3 ) using modes with angular degrees @xmath4 ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the inclusion of high - degree modes ( _ i.e. _ , up to @xmath5 ) has the potential to improve dramatically the inference of the sound speed and the adiabatic exponent ( @xmath6 ) in the outermost 2 to 3% of the solar radius , allowing to construct localized kernels as close to the solar surface as 1.75 mm @xcite .",
    "the effects of the equation of state , through the ionization of hydrogen and helium , are felt most strongly in the outer layers of the sun , making this shallow region of particular interest . furthermore , dynamical effects of convection , and the processes that excite and damp the solar oscillations , are predominantly concentrated in this region .",
    "although the spatial resolution of the modern helioseismic instruments allows us to observe oscillation modes up to @xmath7 = 1000 and higher , only a small fraction of them are currently used ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "unfortunately , analysis of high - degree data is complicated by the fact that the individual modes can not be isolated ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the solar structure is not static , but changes over the solar cycle .",
    "it is well known that the mode frequencies change with solar activity .",
    "it seems that the responsible mechanism is restricted to the outer layers of the sun ( ) , where the high - degree modes are confined .",
    "however , at the moment , there is no general agreement in the precise physical mechanism that gives rise to the frequency variation .",
    "it is likely a product of the change in the subphotospheric small - scale magnetic field strength with the solar activity cycle ( _ e.g. _ , ) . accordingly to",
    ", the frequency shift is easily explained in terms of a variation in the turbulent velocities associated with the magnetic field variation rather than the sole direct effect of the magnetic field itself .",
    ", using models of the structure and evolution of the sun , found that turbulence near the surface of the sun plays a major role in solar variability , and only a model that includes a magnetically modulated turbulent mechanism can agree with the observed correlation between the frequency shift and the solar cycle .",
    "in such a dynamic model , the evolution of the subsurface layers of the sun through the activity cycle plays an important role .    the frequencies of the global modes give the radius and latitude @xmath8 part of the structure .",
    "while , local helioseismic techniques such as ring - diagram analysis @xcite allow the determination of the three - dimensional structure of the sun , allowing the study of localized areas in the solar surface , such as those in active regions .",
    "large variations of the mode frequencies observed in and near sunspots in comparison to magnetically quiet regions are well known to be correlated with variations in the average surface magnetic field between the corresponding regions .",
    "( _ e.g. _ , and ) . whether the frequencies are changed directly by the magnetic field or indirectly through an associated change in the solar structure ( such as a pressure change )",
    "is still a matter of debate .",
    "a detailed analysis of the frequency - shift characteristics will hopefully help understand their physical origin .",
    ", using ring - diagram analysis , found that the sound speed is lower in the immediate subsurface layers of an active region than of a magnetically quiet region , while the opposite is true for depths below about 7 mm .",
    "however , , using global analysis , have found no observable structural changes in the inner layers of the sun below a depth of 21 mm associated with the magnetic - activity induced frequency shifts .",
    "they were , however , unable to get closer to the solar surface due to the lack of high - degree modes in their mode set .",
    "high - degree global analysis is important to complete the picture of the near - surface layers .",
    "besides , the determination of high - degree frequencies using different methods allows us to check the results against each other giving confidence in the results and avoiding systematic errors .",
    "we should point out that , although the high - degree modes have short lifetimes ( one  ten hours for @xmath9 accordingly to ) propagating only locally , they are averaged over most of the solar surface using spherical harmonic decomposition ( over a relatively long time series ) and thus can still be called global analysis .    in the traditional global helioseismology data - analysis methodology , a time series of full - disk doppler solar images is decomposed into spherical harmonic coefficients , characterized by its degree ( @xmath7 ) and its azimuthal order ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "each coefficient time series is fourier transformed , and the order of the radial wave function ( @xmath11 ) gets separated in the frequency domain . however , a spherical harmonic decomposition is not orthonormal over less than the full sphere  _",
    "i.e. _ , the solar surface that can be observed from a single view point resulting in what is referred as spatial leakage . at low and intermediate degrees ,",
    "most of these leaks are separated in the frequency domain from the target mode ( except for some @xmath10 leaks ) and individual modes can be identified and fitted . however , at high degrees , the spatial leaks lie closer in frequency ( due to a smaller mode separation ) and , at high frequency , the modes become wider ( as the mode lifetimes get smaller ) , resulting in the overlap of the target mode with the spatial leaks that merges individual peaks into ridges ( see figure  1 in ) .",
    "the characteristics of the resulting ridge ( central frequency , amplitude , _ etc _  ) do not correspond to those of the underlying target mode .",
    "this has so far hindered the estimation of unbiased mode parameters at high degrees .    to recover the actual mode characteristics",
    ", we need a very good estimation of the relative amplitude of the spatial leaks present in a given @xmath12 power spectrum , also known as the leakage matrix , which in turn requires a very good knowledge of the instrumental properties @xcite . in our previous papers ( and , hereafter krs )",
    ", we described in detail the large influence of the instrumental properties on the amplitude of the leaks and as a consequence in the determination of unbiased high - degree mode parameters .    in the following , we will first describe the data used in this analysis and the ridge - to - mode correction applied to them ( sections  [ useddata ] and [ ridgemodel ] ) . in section  [ instreff ] , we will discuss the influence on the mode parameters of each of the instrumental properties that were included in the spherical harmonic decomposition of the solar images .",
    "we then analyze in section  [ highdegree ] the characteristics of the high - degree mode frequencies and their rotational splittings obtained in this work .",
    "finally , in section  [ solarcycle ] , we analyze the frequency variation induced by the solar cycle .",
    "the data used in this work consist of full - disk dopplergrams obtained at a one - minute cadence by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) . we have used two distinct sets of data .",
    "one while mdi was operating in its 4 \" resolution mode , allowing the detection of oscillation modes up to @xmath13 , which we will call from now on the high-@xmath7 data set .",
    "this is the so - called _ dynamics program _ observing mode , which is available every year for two to three months .",
    "the second one ( hereafter referred to as the medium-@xmath7 data set ) using mdi _ structure program _ that provides almost continuous coverage year round . in this observing mode , the original dopplergrams are convolved , onboard the mdi instrument , with a gaussian and subsampled on a @xmath14 grid , thus reducing the telemetry requirements but also limiting the spatial resolution to modes with degree @xmath4 .    for the high-@xmath7 set , we computed the spherical harmonic decomposition of the mdi images for modes with @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting time series were fourier transformed in small segments ( 4096 minutes ) whose spectra were averaged to produce an averaged power spectrumwith a low but adequate frequency resolution to fit the ridge while reducing the realization noise .",
    "the number of averaged spectra varies with the year , from 12 segments in 2003 , to 30 in 2001 .",
    "most of the known instrumental effects relevant to the high - degree analysis were included in the spatial decomposition and they will be described in section  [ instreff ] . the peaks in each @xmath16 spectrum were then fitted using an asymmetric lorentzian profile with an additive background term , given by ten to the power of a second - degree polynomial in frequency ( equation  5 in krs ) .",
    "since the number of segments used in the average of each @xmath16 spectrum is large enough , its @xmath17 distribution can be approximate by a gaussian distribution and a least - square fitting was used .",
    "the fitted lorentzian profile is characterized by the following parameters : frequency ( @xmath18 ) , amplitude ( @xmath19 ) , width ( @xmath20 ) and , asymmetry ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the asymmetric profile used is equivalent to the one defined by where their asymmetric parameter is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the frequency splittings were parametrized in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients up to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the number of modes analysed was reduced without loss of information to the work described in this paper and hence was easy to handle .",
    "the fitting was carried out only every tenth @xmath7 and only for some 50 equally spaced @xmath10 values at each @xmath7 . the central frequency , _",
    "i.e. _ the frequency free of splitting effects , is taken to be the frequency given by @xmath24 in the splitting parametrization .",
    "since the even splitting coefficients are zero on average , it is the same as the mean frequency ( averaged over @xmath10 ) .",
    "notice that the fitted parameters are ridge parameters and do not correspond to the associated mode parameters as discussed in the introduction . in this study ,",
    "high-@xmath7 time series available from 1999 until 2005 were used and their properties are listed in table  [ table_epochs ] .",
    ".details of the analyzed time series .",
    "the corresponding relative mean values of solar uv spectral irradiance and their standard deviation are also listed as an indication of the solar activity level . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     @xmath25 in these cases , the difference depends on the frequency ( see text ) .",
    "the ray - trace model of the mdi optical configuration predicts a radial distortion ( @xmath26 ) which depends on the distance from the ccd center ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 pixels@xmath30 and @xmath31 is the observed image mean radius @xcite .",
    "the distortion causes the apparent solar radius to be larger by @xmath320.17% ( @xmath320.8 pixels or 17 @xmath33 m ) .",
    "thus , the second term in equation  ( [ eq : raddist ] ) was added to ensure that the distorted and undistorted images have the same mean radius .     as in figure",
    "[ fig : imagescale ] , figure  [ fig : radist ] shows the offset variation corresponding to the difference in the observed ridge frequencies when including this distortion in the spatial decomposition .",
    "similarly to the image scale , the frequency offset increases with frequency .",
    "the similarity is expected , since the radial distortion changes the image scale by an amount that is a function of the distance from the ccd center @xmath27 ( equation  [ eq : raddist ] ) .",
    "the difference in the ridge width also increases with frequency from @xmath34 @xmath33hz at @xmath35 mhz to @xmath36 @xmath33hz at @xmath37 mhz , in the sense including minus not including the distortion , but it is very small in comparison with the fitting uncertainties and barely significant .",
    "the effect on the other parameters is small and it is listed in table  [ variation ] .",
    "the ridge modeling of this effect , introducing the radial distortion in the leakage matrix , agrees well with the observations ( red circles in figure  [ fig : radist ] ) .",
    "solar images as observed by mdi have a nearly elliptical shape with a difference between the semi - major and the semi - minor axis of about 0.6 pixels .",
    "this is consistent with a small tilt ( @xmath322@xmath38 ) in the detector around an axis that is rotated 56@xmath38 from the detector s",
    "horizontal @xmath39-axis and it introduces a non - radial image distortion . in krs , we estimated this distortion using different observational methods",
    ". unfortunately , the distortion varies by as much as 35% depending on the data used , with the correspondent ccd tilt varying from 1.71@xmath38 to 2.6@xmath38 . also estimated the non - radial distortion using yet another observational method  the mercury transit across the sun on 7 may 2003  and found a 3.3@xmath38 tilt .",
    "although their equations to estimate the distortion have the same general form as ours ( krs ) , there are other differences besides the tilt angle between the two calculations .",
    "their estimation of the distortion varies by 14% in relation to our estimation using a 2.6@xmath38 tilt .",
    "these discrepancies in the estimated distortion using different observational methods might be attributed to a number of reasons such as the inaccuracy of our simple model for the non - circular shape of the solar images or the influence of an optical aberration ( an asymmetric psf , for example ) .    to analyze the effect of the non - radial distortion on the power spectra",
    ", we included in the spherical harmonic decomposition our estimation that has the largest tilt angle ( 2.6@xmath38 ) , which corresponds to the distortion that better reproduces the solar limb shape .",
    "although , to the moment , we were unable to determine precisely the non - radial distortion pattern , our estimation provides an improvement to the analysis and it will be incorporated from then on in the paper . fortunately , it has an overall small effect on the observed spectra , as can be inferred from table  [ variation ] , and we can safely extrapolate that small variations from this distortion pattern can only correspond to variations in the parameters smaller than the differences shown in the table which were obtained comparing with using no correction for the non - radial distortion , and most likely negligible .      the roll angle of the soho spacecraft is maintained such that the effective position angle - axis . ] ( @xmath40 ) of the mdi images should always be zero .",
    "however , a 0.2@xmath38 difference has been measured by intercomparing mdi and gong images obtained in 1999 and 2000 ( cliff toner , private communication ) . estimated a 0.07@xmath38 difference , assuming that there is no equator - crossing flow , after re - gaining contact with the soho spacecraft ( in 1999 ) and 0.1@xmath38 before losting contact .",
    "no noticeable effect is seen in the observed ridge parameters after including a 0.2@xmath38 correction ( table  [ variation ] ) .",
    "we do not see the 3 nhz variation in the @xmath41-coefficient offset that was predicted by our ridge model using a slightly higher correction of 0.25@xmath38 ( krs ) .",
    "this is probably because we did not accurately model the @xmath42-angle correction in the leakage matrix calculation , but added a very simple approximation of its effect .",
    "accordingly to , the standard values used for the two angles specifying the orientation of the solar rotation axis @xmath43 is the angle between the plane of the ecliptic and the solar equator and @xmath44 is the angle between the crossing point of the solar equator with the ecliptic and the vernal equinox .",
    "] , known as the carrington elements , are off by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this introduces a time - varying correction in the calculation of the rotation axis projection in the plane of the sky , _",
    "i.e. _ the position angle , @xmath42 , and the roll angle , @xmath47 is the heliographic latitude of the central point of the disk and presents an annual variation . ] .",
    "this correction in the @xmath42 angle will be on top of the one mentioned in the previous section .",
    "introducing a correction of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the image spatial decomposition has no significant effect on the observed ridge parameters ( table  [ variation ] ) .",
    "here we analyze the frequencies and splitting coefficients obtained using the high-@xmath7 data set .",
    "the mode parameters were obtained after including the five known instrumental effects in the spatial decomposition of the high-@xmath7 data sets described in section  [ instreff ] , fitting their observed power spectra using an asymmetric lorentzian profile ( section  [ useddata ] ) and applying the ridge - to - mode correction to the fitted ridge parameters ( section  [ ridgemodel ] ) .",
    "first , in section  [ sub : check ] , the high-@xmath7 data set mode frequencies and splitting coefficients are compared with the values obtained by the medium-@xmath7 analysis . figure  [ fig : lnu ] shows the region of common modes between the two sets .",
    "this comparison is done to check the goodness of the estimation of the mode parameters from the observed ridge in the high-@xmath7 data set at these high medium-@xmath7 common modes .",
    "then , the estimated high-@xmath7 frequencies and splitting coefficients at @xmath50 are analyzed ( sections  [ hl_freq ] and [ hl_ai ] ) .",

    "the high-@xmath7 set used in this comparison was analyzed as described in sections  [ useddata ] , [ ridgemodel ] , and including all instrumental effects analyzed in the section  [ instreff ] . in the medium-@xmath7 mode range ,",
    "the spatial leaks are well separated from the target mode and individual modes can be identified and fitted . by decreasing the observed high-@xmath7 set frequency resolution using a short time string ( 4096 minutes ) , and thus increasing the width of the window function , we force the width of the spatial leaks to increase .",

    "were fitted for every @xmath7 ( and not every tenth @xmath7 ) .",
    "the set of modes used in this comparison consists of 420 @xmath1 modes with @xmath51 and @xmath52 mhz and 60 @xmath2-modes with @xmath53 and @xmath54 mhz observed during 2004 .",
    "the mode frequencies agree within 1 @xmath33hz ( figure  [ fig : d04-top ] top panel ) .",
    "their difference varies with frequency having a maximum at 2 mhz and decreasing to zero ( or near zero ) at 1.6 and 3 mhz .",
    "there is no indication of a degree dependence .",
    "although 1 @xmath33hz is a small value , it is almost one order of magnitude larger than the fitting uncertainty of these modes ( 0.12 @xmath33hz on average ) and hence undesirable .",
    "this seems to indicate that the frequency offsets @xmath55 ( figure  [ fig : offset ] ) are underestimated by @xmath3235% for modes with frequencies in the range 1.7 to 2.3 mhz , this amount decreases to 10% around 1.6 mhz and zero in the interval between 2.6 and 3.2 mhz where the estimation is correct . there is some indication that at 3.4 mhz the offsets are again underestimated ( by @xmath5630% ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no common modes at higher frequencies",
    ".    a variation in the mode frequency that is purely a function of frequency does not affect the outcome of the solar structure inversion , since it is removed together with the near - surface errors in the physics of the solar model ( see section  [ hl_freq ] ) . the instrumental effect that is probably causing the frequency offset to be underestimated at certain frequencies",
    "might be the instrumental psf which is not included in the image spatial decomposition or in the leakage matrix calculation ( see section  [ sec : imagescale ] ) . besides the frequency dependence , there is a puzzling frequency difference ( @xmath57hz ) in the @xmath58 modes ( green circles in figure  [ fig : d04-top ] top panel ) with respect to the adjacent @xmath11 values .",

    "the horizontal - to - vertical displacement ratio decreases exponentially with @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the differences observed only for @xmath59 modes could be an indication of an unaccounted instrumental effect that has a stronger effect on the horizontal component of the leakage matrix than on its vertical component .",
    "note also that the @xmath2 modes in the medium-@xmath7 set are fitted using a different frequency interval around the peak in the power spectrum than the @xmath1 modes @xcite .",

    "the estimation of the mode frequency and splitting coefficients from the observed ridge in the high-@xmath7 data set at these moderate - degree values is , in general , quite good .",

    "the difference between the observed and theoretical frequencies due to the near - surface errors in the model are well known to be quite large ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the general trend is such that the observed @xmath1-mode frequencies are smaller than their theoretical prediction and , at a high enough degree , the differences increase with degree and with frequency . accordingly to the results obtained by the high-@xmath7 set , this difference can be as large as 60 @xmath33hz .",
    "in fact , for a given @xmath11 , the frequency differences increase almost linearly with degree with a slope that also increases linearly with @xmath11 .",
    "the high-@xmath7 set analysis gives consistent frequencies for all observational periods listed in table  [ table_epochs ] , where the differences in the frequencies obtained at the different observational periods can be explained by their well known variation with solar cycle activity and it is described in detail in section  [ solarcycle ] .    in order to compensate for the frequency shifts due to the near - surface errors in the model , an unknown function ( @xmath73 ) , the so - called surface term ( @xmath73 )",

    "their difference is smaller than 3 @xmath33hz for @xmath80 .",
    "part of this variation is due to the fact that the projection of the spherical solar surface onto a flat detector introduces some foreshortening that depends on the distance of the region from disk center , which can introduce systematic errors in determining the mode characteristics .",

    "the observed frequency shift is larger for higher - frequency and for higher-@xmath7 modes . as pointed out by , these modes are more sensitive to surface perturbations , because they have , respectively , higher upper- and lower - reflection points in the sun .",

    "the falloff was reported to happen around 3.7 mhz by  using @xmath161 modes - and  using @xmath162 modes , which is supported by determinations ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "however , do not see any falloff for @xmath164 mhz modes ( @xmath165 ) and see the drop at 5 mhz ( using @xmath166 modes ) .",
    "the exact frequencies where the frequency shifts become zero or negative or reach a maximum negative value also varies widely between the publications .",
    "this sharp decrease in the frequency shift has been associated to an increase in the chromospheric temperature ( _ e.g. _ , and ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : pc ] , high - frequency modes have a large probability @xmath124 of being uncorrelated with the solar cycle , at least until 5.2 mhz . note that @xmath118 is calculated for the absolute value of @xmath27 , estimating the probability of being correlated or anti - correlated with solar cycle . in our analysis ,",
    "the frequency shift drops sharply around 4.6 mhz and there are a few modes ( @xmath32 ten ) with a negative frequency shift with frequencies between 5 and 5.35 mhz .",
    "however , only modes with frequency smaller than 4.9 mhz obey the mode selection criteria ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath167 ) and were included in figure  [ fig : slope ] . the frequency shift drop from 4.6 to 4.9 mhz is not seen in figure  [ fig : slope ] because of the mode - inertia normalization .",
    "as first suggested by , the most significant sources of frequency shift must be localized near the solar surface since the frequency shifts seem to be independent of @xmath7 .",
    "consider a small perturbation in the solar equilibrium model localized near the solar surface and the corresponding changes in the mode frequency , @xmath126 . for modes extending",
    "substantially more deeply than the region of the perturbation , the eigenfunctions are nearly independent of @xmath7 at fixed frequency in that region ( see figure  8 and the associated discussion in ) . from this",
    ", it can be inferred that if the quantity @xmath168 is independent of @xmath7 at fixed @xmath169 for a given set of modes , then the perturbation is probably largely localized outside the radius given by the maximum lower turning point of the set of modes considered @xcite . in the case of the frequency shift induced by the solar cycle ,",
    "@xmath168 is independent of @xmath7 at fixed @xmath169 for all modes analyzed here , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 @xmath33hz .",
    "thus , the perturbation causing the frequency shift is probably localized in the region 4 mm below the solar surface or less . using the same reasoning , the thickness of the near - surface region where",
    "the uncertainties in the physics of the model are confined can be inferred . in this case , the set of modes where @xmath168 is independent of @xmath7 at fixed @xmath169 is such that @xmath172 @xmath33hz and @xmath173 using the high-@xmath7 frequency determination ( section  [ hl_freq ] ) .",
    "including higher - degree modes , @xmath168 is not a function of frequency alone anymore ( see , for example , figure  3 in ) . as a result ,",
    "the frequency uncertainties in the model are probably largely restricted to the layers 18 mm below the surface .",
    "in the determination of unbiased high - degree mode parameters , the instrumental characteristics must be taken into account in the image spatial decomposition or in the leakage matrix calculation itself to obtain a correct estimation of the relative amplitude of the spatial leaks . among the instrumental characteristics analyzed here , the image scale is the one that affects the parameter determination the most .",
    "the image scale is the ratio of the image dimensions observed on the ccd detector and the dimensions in the actual sun .",
    "an error in the image scale introduces an error in the estimated central frequency which increases with the mode frequency . a 0.27% error in the image scale",
    "would shift the estimated central frequency by as much as 11 @xmath33hz at 5 mhz .",
    "the radial distortion also has an important effect which is expected since it is similar to an image scale error .",
    "an instrumental property not taken into account here ( due to a lack of a good estimation ) that could have an important effect on the measured parameters is an azimuthally varying psf .",
    "the applied ridge - to - mode correction recovers frequencies at moderate degree that differ from the assumed corrected values by 1 @xmath33hz or less depending on the mode frequency .",
    "the fitting uncertainty of the recovered frequencies is in the range 0.070.18 @xmath33hz .",
    "the agreement for the @xmath41 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 coefficients is very good , except maybe for @xmath2- and @xmath174-mode @xmath41 coefficients , their mean difference with respect to the assumed correct values is , respectively , three and two normalized by the ridge fitting uncertainties .    at high degree , the differences between our frequency determination and theoretical frequencies for the @xmath1 modes shows the same general variation with degree as the results obtained with ring analysis . for @xmath80 , the global and ring analysis agree within 6 @xmath33hz .",
    "the high - degree @xmath2-mode frequencies obtained using ring analysis , like previous observations ( and references within ) , are substantially lower than the theoretical frequencies .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath2-mode high-@xmath7 set frequencies agree well with the model frequencies ( within 3 @xmath33hz ) whereas the ring - analysis frequency differences can be as large as 13 @xmath33hz for @xmath101 modes .",
    "the implications of the high-@xmath7 frequencies and splitting coefficients on the solar structure and rotation will be addressed in a future paper .    as noted by other authors for low- and moderate - degree modes ( _ e.g. _ , )",
    ", the frequency shift induced by the solar cycle scales well with the mode inertia .",
    "we extended this analysis to high - degree modes and found out that scaling with the mode inertia normalized by the inertia of a radial mode of the same frequency follows a simple power law ( given by equation  [ eq : plaw ] ) with one exponent at all frequency ranges , where the @xmath2 and @xmath1 modes are fitted independently of one another .",
    "the exponents obtained using four different solar indices agree within their fitting uncertainty , where : @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath2-mode exponent is less than half of the @xmath1-mode value .",
    "the fundamental mode of solar oscillations has essentially the character of surface gravity waves and , contrary to the @xmath1 modes , it is essentially incompressible and independent of the hydrostatic structure of the sun .",
    "hence , it is not a surprise that these different types of modes have different exponents . due to their different properties , it is also very likely that different physical effects are responsible for their frequency variation .",
    "accondingly to , for the @xmath2 modes , the dominant cause of frequency shift is the variation of the subphotospheric magnetic field . for the @xmath1 modes , it is the decrease in the radial component of the turbulent velocity in the outer layers during the increase in solar activity , which is accompanied by a decrease in temperature ( due to a decrease in the efficiency of convective transport ) .",
    "at low frequency ( @xmath175 mhz ) , the @xmath1-mode frequency shifts have a different behavior than at high-@xmath169 : a step ( with the same exponent @xmath136 ) or , as found by other authors , an exponent twice as large as the one at high-@xmath169 .",
    "low - frequency modes have a large probability of being uncorrelated with the solar cycle , which was not taken into account in the case where a large exponent was estimated",
    ". the @xmath2-mode frequency shifts also have a different behavior around 1.7 mhz : they increase abruptly by an order of magnitude .    modes with frequency around 3 mhz have the smallest probability that their variation is linearly uncorrelated with the solar index , while modes with @xmath35 mhz or @xmath37 mhz have the largest probability of being uncorrelated .",
    "a large probability ( @xmath124 ) of being uncorrelated does not necessarily means that a given mode is not physically correlated with the solar cycle , instead it could be due to uncertainties in the measurements , a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath124 is well correlated with the logarithm of the relative uncertainty of the estimated frequency shift @xmath176 , the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.71 for medium-@xmath7 modes and 0.54 for high-@xmath7 modes . if a given mode has a large probability of being linearly uncorrelated , it is expected that the linear fitting of its frequency shifts will have a large uncertainty , hence the high correlation coefficient between @xmath124 and the estimated frequency shift uncertainty .",
    "however , it raises the question of what could be the physical process that would make those modes less sensitive to solar activity . for a given @xmath7 , the upper reflection point for lower - frequency modes is deeper in the sun than for high - frequency modes .",
    "if the perturbation layer causing the frequency shift is above the upper turning point of the mode , it would not be affected by the solar cycle . accordingly to model s of christensen - dalsgaard , the depth of the upper turning point increases sharply with decreasing frequency below 2.3 mhz .",
    "the upper turning point for a radial mode with @xmath177 mhz is 0.5 mm deeper in the sun than a three - millihertz mode ( from figure  2 in ) . at high - frequency",
    ", the observed frequency shift seems to suddendly drop to zero . however , there is no agreement on the exact frequency that this happens , the observed values range from 3.7 to 5 mhz .",
    "the frequency - shift falloff is explained by an increase of chromospheric temperature and magnetic field at solar maximum ( and references within ) . in the presence of an inclined magnetic field ,",
    "high - frequency modes tunnel through the temperature minimum and are particularly sensitive to changes in the chromosphere , which are expected to be well correlated with solar activity",
