    "a qn is the explosive transition of a massive neutron star ( ns ) to a quark star ( qs ; the compact remnant ) .",
    "it ejects the outermost layers of the ns as the relativistic qn ejecta with kinetic energy exceeding excess @xmath2 erg .",
    "the interaction of this ejecta with its surroundings leads to unique phenomena and has important implications to astrophysics .",
    "when occurring in binaries , quark - novae ( qne ) have the potential to transform our view of binary evolution and has serious implications to both high - energy astrophysics and cosmology . after a description of the qn and its energetics in section 2 , we briefly review two cases of qne in binaries .",
    "the first case is a qn - ia ( section 3 ) which is a qn going off in a short period binary consisting of ( the exploding ) ns and a white dwarf ( wd ) which is the mass reservoir .",
    "the extremely dense relativistic qn ejecta impacts ( shocks , compresses and heats ) the wd and triggers the thermonuclear run - away of a traditional type ia .",
    "along side the type ia , the spinning - down qs provides an additional power source which  tampers \" with the energy budget . in the second case ,",
    "we show that a qn occurring in a massive binary can account for the  exotic \" light - cuves of double - humped hydrogen poor slsne ( section 4 ) .",
    "we summarize in section 5 .",
    "we define @xmath3 as the critical mass for a non - rotating ns to undergo quark deconfinement in its core .",
    "the presence of enough strange quarks in the deconfined core of the ns then triggers the conversion of hadrons ( i.e. matter made of _ up _ and _ down _ quarks ) to the conjectured more stable _ ( uds ) _ matter ( i.e. matter made of free _ up _ , _ down _ and _ strange _ quarks)@xcite . in a qn@xcite ,",
    "the _ ( ud)-to-(uds ) _ conversion front propagates toward the surface of the ns while harnessing neutrino@xcite , photon@xcite and gravitational energy@xcite possibly yielding a detonative regime . micro - physics driven hydrodynamical simulations of this conversion process seem to indicate that a detonation may indeed occur@xcite and when coupled with gravitational collapse may lead to a universal mechanism for the ejection of the ns outermost layers ( @xmath4 of qn ejecta ) with a universal kinetic energy , @xmath5 , of a few times @xmath2 erg ( i.e. with an associated lorentz factor exceeding @xmath6)@xcite .",
    "thus the kinetic energy released in a qn exceeds that of a supernova by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the neutron - rich qn ejecta provides a favorable site for nucleosynthesis@xcite . when this ejecta ( expanding radially outward from the parent ns ) collides with the preceding sn ejecta , it re - energizes and re - brightens the sn yielding a superluminous sn@xcite .",
    "this double - detonation generates a superluminous double - peaked light - curve if the time - delay between the sn and the qn exceeds a few days .",
    "we account for the luminosity@xcite , the photometric / spectroscopic signatures@xcite as well as introduce nuclear / spallation signatures resulting from the interaction of the ultra - relativistic qn ejecta with the sn shell and circumstellar material@xcite . for shorter time - delays of less than a day",
    ", the qn kinetic energy is lost to pdv work but the collision between the qn ejecta with the sn ejecta yields unique nuclear signatures which may explain existing observations@xcite .",
    "the qs shows features reminiscent of soft gamma repeaters @xcite while the explosion energetics and variability are reminiscent of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .    when occurring in binaries , the more complex interactions with the companion result in even more interesting features .",
    "we review the key signatures and main implications to astrophysics in this paper .",
    "we first discuss what happens when a ns in a close binary with a wd companion explodes as a qn . in this scenario ,",
    "roche - lobe overflow disrupts the wd which produces a carbon - oxygen ( co ) torus surrounding the ns @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the ns may fully merge with the wd so that the ns now is in the core of the wd when the qn occurs .",
    "the qn will be triggered following sufficient mass accretion .",
    "some of the relativistic qn ejecta will impact ( shock , heat and compress ) the disrupted wd inducing a runaway nuclear burning of the co in an event we termed a qn - ia since it is `` type ia''-like explosion . a crucial difference here however is the qs which provides extra power through magnetic braking spin - down and consequently a qn - ia ( which spectrum resembles a type - ia sn ) is powered by a combination of @xmath1ni decay and the spin - down luminosity of the qs .",
    "this has drastic consequences for cosmological models if qne - ia contaminate the sample of type ia sne used as distance indicators in cosmology as discussed below .",
    "the spin - down contribution yields a _ red - shift - dependent phillips - like relation _ ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) shows the correlation between peak absolute magnitude and light - curve shape ) which means that they can confuse ( i.e. are _ not _ rejected by the ) light - curve fitters used for cosmology ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4 ) ) .",
    "the rate of qne - ia may be a significant fraction of the observed type ia sne and may be dominant at higher redshift@xcite .",
    "this is especially egregious given that the qn - ia light - curve varies with redshift .    to estimate the effect of contamination",
    ", we analyzed hundreds of synthetic qne - ia light - curves using the salt2 light - curve fitting software@xcite to find the difference ( @xmath7 ) between the actual distance modulus and the fitted distance modulus as a function of redshift , @xmath8 .",
    "most of the simulated qne - ia were best fitted@xcite with : @xmath9 for @xmath10 there is a strong correlation since @xmath11 , but at @xmath12 the correlation is much weaker @xmath13 . we conclude that if qne - ia represent an important fraction of the sne used in the work which estimates the accelerating expansion of the universe@xcite , this may have drastically altered the statistics and conclusions of those studies @xcite .",
    "it is thus vital to differentiate between qne - ia and standard sne - ia . applying our correction above to the union2.1 data@xcite we obtain the true distance moduli of the observed sne - ia ( if they are indeed qne - ia ) as shown by red crosses in ( * ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) . this demonstrates how the sne - ia distance moduli ,",
    "when corrected , lay very close to the @xmath14 , @xmath15 curve .",
    "a qn - ia may have already been observed in sn 2014j @xcite .",
    "sn 2014j s @xmath16 mass was estimated to be @xmath17 @xcite , based on @xmath18 decay lines .",
    "however , based on the peak luminosity , @xmath19 is expected . in the qn - ia model",
    ", the discrepancy can be accounted for by the qs spin - down power .",
    "perhaps the best prospect for observationally distinguishing a qn - ia from a sn - ia is the detection of the gravitational wave signal produced during the explosive transition of the ns to a qs . if the qn is asymmetric , it should emit a gravitational wave signal that could be observable by advanced ligo@xcite .",
    "this would be followed by another signal from the exploding wd ; here the time delay between the qn and the exploding wd is the time it takes the qn ejecta to reach the disrupted wd plus the burning time of the wd .",
    "other types of type ia sne ( i.e. single or double degenerate scenarios ) would lack such a dual signal .",
    "another strong observational signature of a qn - ia is high - energy emission ( specifically x - ray signatures@xcite ) from the qs which would be impossible in standard sne - ia channels .",
    "the qs , being an aligned rotator , would be radio quiet @xcite . these signature may be observed in the near future in sn 2014j .    ) by the qn .",
    "the second hump is from the bh - accretion phase after the qs merges with the co core .",
    "the circles show u - band observations of the slsn asassn-15lh@xcite.,width=288 ]",
    "qne are likely to occur in binaries experiencing ce phases where the ns can accrete enough mass to reach @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , in massive binaries experiencing two ce phases , the ns would have access to two mass reservoirs@xcite . in this picture ,",
    "the ns would have evolved earlier from its more massive progenitor and is companion to the second star during its ce phase .",
    "when the system enters the ce phase ( in which the hydrogen envelope is ejected ) , it leaves behind a close binary consisting of the ns and the giant star",
    "s he core . at this point",
    "the he - core has a mass of a few @xmath20 and an orbital separation of @xmath21 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) ) . during this phase ,",
    "the ns accretes up to @xmath22 and relies on the second ce to grow in mass .",
    "the he core then expands causing a second he - rich ce phase .",
    "sufficient mass is accreted onto the ns during this second ce and the ns reaches @xmath3 and undergoes a qn explosion inside the expanded hydrogen - poor envelope .",
    "the qn ejecta shocks and unbinds the ce providing a bright , short - lived hump matching those observed in double - humped slsne@xcite .    following the qn , the remaining system consists of a qs and the co core ( of mass @xmath23 ) of the he star .",
    "orbital decay lead to a merger a few days to a few weeks following the qn event .",
    "the qs then rapidly accretes from the co core leading to the collapse of the qs into a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the remainder of the co core is subsequently accreted by the bh .",
    "the accretion luminosity powers the long lasting main hump of the double - humped slsn .",
    "figure 1 shows our fit to the recently discovered slsn asassn-15lh@xcite .",
    "we fit it with a ce mass and radius of @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the bh - accretion parameters are @xmath25 erg s@xmath26 for the initial accretion luminosity with an injection power in time @xmath27 .",
    "the time delay between the qn event and the onset of bh - accretion is 20 days .",
    "these parameters are similar to those we used to fit a number of hydrogen - poor slsne@xcite ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) and ( * ? ? ? * figure 2 ) ) .",
    "our model can also fit double - peaked slsne showing late - time emission ( e.g. iptf13ehe and lsq14bdq ) which we modelled as the collision between the he - rich ce ( ejected by the qn ) and the hydrogen - rich ( i.e. first ) ce ejected during the firts ce phase ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) ) .",
    "the available accretion energy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the bh - accretion efficiency ) is enough to account for the extreme radiation released during the long - lasting hump in slsne .",
    "the qn is key to our model since besides accounting for the first peak , it also ejects the second ce at speeds of a few @xmath30 km s@xmath26 which ensures a very efficient harnessing of the bh - accretion input power by the very large envelope a few days to a few weeks following the qn event .",
    "the qn deposits its momentum and energy impulsively in the ce which makes our model fundamentally different from those involving spin - down power where the energy is deposited gradually .",
    "qne should be common in binaries where accretion onto the ns from a companion ( i.e. the disrupted wd in lmxbs ) or during a ce phase ( i.e. during massive binaries evolution ) can drive the ns above the critical mass , @xmath3 , triggering the qn .",
    "the ability of the qn model in binaries to fit slsne in general ( see http://www.quarknova.ca/lcgallery.html ) and in particular a number of double - humped slsne ia , suggests that qne may be an important component of massive binary evolution and may even be responsible for ce ejection .",
    "the qn - ia model has two main interesting features : first , the detonation of the wd in the qn - ia scenario is explained by standard shock physics governing the interaction of the qn ejecta and the wd . secondly , the qn - ia provides an elegant explanation for the correlation between peak magnitude and light - curve shape through the contribution of spin - down energy to the light - curve .",
    "our model can be tested by further work including simulations of qne in binary evolution .",
    "our model relies on the feasibility of the qn explosion which requires sophisticated simulations of the burning of a ns to a qs which are being pursued .",
    "preliminary simulations with consistent treatment of nuclear and neutrino reactions , particle diffusion and hydrodynamics show instabilities which could lead to a detonation@xcite .",
    "we also propose that a  core - collapse \" qn could result from the collapse of the quark matter core@xcite which provides another avenue for the explosion .",
