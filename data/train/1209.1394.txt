    "the overwhelming amount of cosmological observations obtained over the past few years has allowed not only the precise determination of the parameters of the standard cosmological model but also has provided plenty of scope to test non - standard physics and cosmological assumptions such as the constancy of fundamental constants over cosmological timescales .",
    "the variation of fundamental constants is a prediction of theories attempting to unify the four interactions in nature , such as string derived field theories , related brane - world theories and kaluza - klein theories ( see * ? ? ?",

    "substantial work have been devoted to constrain such variations using cosmological observations @xcite .",

    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a powerful tool to study the early universe .",
    "the acoustic oscillations present in the cmb power spectrum are also imprinted through the baryons on the large - scale structure ( lss ) power spectrum @xcite .",

    "a high redshift galaxy sample from boss data release 9 ( dr9 ) , denoted cmass , is constructed through a set of colour - magnitude cuts designed to select a roughly volume - limited sample of massive , luminous galaxies ( * ? ? ? * padmanabhan et al . in prep . ) .",

    "the position of the peak in the correlation function of galaxies can place constraints on the variation of fundamental constants .",

    "the wmap - spt combination is referred to as our `` cmb '' dataset .",
    "we also use information from other clustering measurements in the form of constraints on the position of the baryon acoustic peak from independent analyses .",
    "we use the results of @xcite which are based on measurements of the large - scale correlation function of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the 2% distance measurement obtained by @xcite and @xcite from the application of an updated version of the reconstruction technique proposed by @xcite to the clustering of galaxies from the final sdss - ii lrg sample @xcite . the results of these analyses are combined in the `` bao '' dataset .",

    "the aforementioned datasets are used in different combinations to check the consistency of the obtained bounds .",
    "firstly , we use the cmb data alone , and then combine it with the cmass correlation function . in the end , we combine the four datasets to obtain our final constraints .",
    "we do not consider supernovae ( sns ) type ia data because the light curves of the sns are obtained assuming that the fundamental constants have their present values at the observing redshift .",
    "however , since we are investigating a possible time evolution in the value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the sns are at considerably high redshift ( @xmath33 for the high-@xmath34 sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can not neglect the possibility that the constants have a different value at those times .",
    "in fact , several studies aiming at measuring the value of @xmath1 at high redshift using quasar absorption systems do not conclusively exclude the variation of fundamental constants at those redshifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , to be conservative , we choose not to consider the supernovae datasets in our analysis .",
    "we follow @xcite and model the shape of the large - scale correlation function , @xmath17 , by applying the following parametrization : @xmath35 ,   \\label{eq : xi_model}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath36 denotes a convolution , and the bias factor @xmath37 , mode - coupling amplitude @xmath38 , and the smoothing length @xmath39 are considered as free parameters and marginalized over . here",

    "the ionization fraction is determined by the balance between photoionization and recombination .",
    "the most important effects of changes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 during this epoch are due to their influence upon thomson scattering cross section @xmath46 and the binding energy of hydrogen @xmath47 .",
    "the ionization history is more sensitive to @xmath1 than to @xmath2 because of the @xmath48 dependence on these constants .",
    "the main result is the shift of the epoch of recombination to higher @xmath34 as @xmath1 or @xmath2 increases , which corresponds to a smaller sound horizon .",
    "these effects are imprinted into the matter power spectrum through the transfer function .",
    "hence , they also affect the galaxy correlation function . consequently ,",
    "if at recombination @xmath1 or @xmath2 had a value higher than the present one , the peak in the correlation function would appear at smaller scales , since the position of the peak is related to the size of the sound horizon at the drag epoch .",
    "[ fig : cf_alfa_emasa ] shows the effect of a variation in @xmath1 and in @xmath2 , during the recombination epoch , that we should expect in the correlation function of cmass galaxies , in a flat universe with cosmological parameters @xmath49 .",

    "this effect can break degeneracies with other cosmological parameters that affect the full shape of the correlation function , such as the dark energy equation of state .",
    "other parameters also affect the position of the peak .",
    "this leads to degeneracies between the fundamental constants and other cosmological parameters , such as @xmath51 , as we will see in sections  [ sec : alpha ] and  [ sec : me ] .",

    "thus , we will use in this paper the correction function as it appears in recfast v1.5 .",
