    "recent measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation angular power spectrum @xcite strongly support the `` standard '' cosmological model in which the energy content of the universe is dominated by dark energy ( very close to einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath3 ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "such @xmath3cdm universes are also in good agreement with independent datasets of galaxy clustering @xcite and distant type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "thus the basic framework for the theory of structure formation in the universe is firmly established .",
    "nevertheless the nature and the physical origin of dark energy remain to be understood .    the apparent accelerating expansion of the universe is conventionally interpreted in terms of a source of repulsive force ( dark energy ) , but can be explained by modifying newton s law of gravity on cosmological scales as well .",
    "the latter resolution has been seriously considered recently .",
    "for example , dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite propose that gravity leaking into extra dimensions drives the observed accelerating expansion .",
    "other such models include modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite and ghost condensation @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , _ all _ of these alternative models predict some deviation from conventional newtonian gravity at cosmological scales .",
    "indeed , while the validity of newtonian gravity is tested to high precision up to the scale of the solar system ( @xmath4 m ) , there have been no rigorous tests at sub - millimeter and over scales beyond the solar system @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that large - scale galaxy clustering can be used to constrain non - newtonian models of gravity @xcite in principle , but it became feasible only recently with accurate measurements of galaxy clustering in large redshift surveys @xcite .    in our earlier work @xcite ( paper i ) , we put quantitative constraints on deviations from newtonian gravity at cosmological scales under the assumption that the deviation can be described in a simple parametric form ; we adopted an empirical yukawa - like term for the modified gravity , and calculated the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum semi - analytically .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for similar argument . ) by comparing the predicted power spectrum with that of sdss galaxies @xcite , we derived quantitative , although still conditional , constraints on deviations from newton s law of gravity .    in this paper , we improve our previous work by performing non - linear cosmological simulations and by exploiting a higher - order statistic , bispectrum .",
    "since bispectrum is sensitive to clustering in the non - linear regime , it is expected to provide complementary constraints at mega - parsec scales to that obtained from power spectrum analysis .",
    "we use direct @xmath0-body simulations to test the accuracy of our semi - analytic calculations and to reinforce our conclusions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : summary ] concludes the present analysis .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize our model and a set of assumptions .",
    "further details may be found in paper i.    we consider a modified newtonian model for which gravitational potential is given by @xmath5 } , \\label{eq : model}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes ( conventional ) newton s constant of gravity .",
    "the above model corresponds to model ii in paper i , on which we focus throughout the following analysis .",
    "the deviation from the newtonian gravity in this model is characterized by two parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; @xmath7 is the dimensionless amplitude of the deviation and @xmath8 is the characteristic length scale .",
    "note that @xmath8 is defined in the proper length , rather than in the comoving length .",
    "it is important to note that , although we consider deviations from newtonian gravity at mega - parsec scales , we still assume that the global cosmic expansion is unaffected by the deviations .",
    "namely , we assume that general relativity is valid on horizon scales and thus the cosmic expansion is described by the standard friedmann equation . strictly speaking",
    ", these two assumptions may be in conflict with modified gravity models in general @xcite . to account for the existing data such as sneia and cmb , however",
    ", the cosmic expansion law can hardly change in practice .",
    "this is why we adopt the conventional friedmann equation even in this analysis .",
    "for the same reason , we use conventional matter transfer function as initial condition of dark matter adopting the background cosmology defined by the standard set of cosmological parameters , @xmath9=0.3 , @xmath10=0.04 , @xmath11 , and the hubble constant at present @xmath12 in units of 100 km @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "see paper i for further discussion on this point .    in order to make a direct comparison between the clustering of sdss galaxies and our model predictions , we need to assume a biasing relation for the distribution of galaxies and that of matter . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt a commonly adopted deterministic relation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fractional fluctuation of galaxy number and mass density , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are linear and quadratic biasing parameters .",
    "we consider only linear bias ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) when we use power spectrum , whereas we consider both @xmath18 and @xmath19 for analyses using bispectrum .",
    "to derive constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath18 is treated as a free parameter to adjust the overall clustering amplitude .",
    "in fourier space , the modified gravitational potential in eq . can be written as @xmath21}_{\\bk }      = 4 \\pi g_{\\rm n } a^2 { \\bar{\\rho}}{\\left[}1 + \\alpha        \\frac{{\\left(}\\frac{a}{k \\lambda } { \\right)}^2}{1 + { \\left(}\\frac{a}{k       \\lambda } { \\right)}^2 } { \\right]}{\\delta_\\bk},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is in the comoving coordinate , @xmath23 is the comoving wave - number , and @xmath24 is the scale factor normalized unity at the present epoch .",
    "for the potential of eq . , the evolution equation for density perturbations is written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 } , \\label{eq:3 - 8}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath28 denotes the linear term in density fluctuations [ see eq .",
    "below ] . note that even the linear perturbation equation becomes dependent on @xmath29 in the modified gravity model .",
    "next , the linear power spectrum @xmath30 at present is given by @xmath31}^2 ,   \\label{eq : linearp}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the matter transfer function , and @xmath33 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum which we set to be unity .",
    "we use the fitting formula of eisenstein and hu @xcite for @xmath32 . it should be emphasized here that we fix the amplitude @xmath34 so that the rms value of the top - hat mass fluctuations at 8@xmath35mpc , @xmath36 , equals 0.9 * when @xmath37 and @xmath38*. the actual value of @xmath36 in our modified gravity model may be slightly different because of the factor @xmath39}^2 $ ] in eq . .",
    "however , the difference in the overall amplitude is unimportant because we have an additional freedom to adjust the predicted amplitude via the biasing relation [ eq . ] .    in paper",
    "i we used the peacock - dodds prescription @xcite to convert the linear power spectrum to nonlinear one .",
    "it turned out that in doing so we used incorrectly the growth factor @xmath40 and the tilt of linear power spectrum @xmath41 given in the case of newtonian models .",
    "we made sure later that the above mistake did not change the final power spectra very much as long as the peacock - dodds prescription is valid . in the present paper ,",
    "we also confirm the validity of the peacock - dodds approach in non - newtonian models using @xmath0-body simulations directly ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : power ] ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the second order perturbation theory and its application to bispectrum . the earlier formulation of cosmological perturbation in the newtonian model may be found in @xcite .",
    "bernardeau @xcite developed a formulation of second order perturbation theory in non - newtonian models .",
