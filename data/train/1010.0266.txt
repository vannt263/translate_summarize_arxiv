    "non - relativistic gravitational problems have been the subject of numerous studies , going back to newton . despite the simplicity of the force law ,",
    "these problems vary greatly in the degree of difficulty .",
    "the two - body problem is easy and the three - body problem has solutions if certain simplifying assumptions are made , while higher @xmath4 problems have no useful analytical solutions . when @xmath4 is large , one can distinguish two types of problems . in the many - body problem ,",
    "the potential is grainy on scales comparable to the particle separation , while in the infinitely many body problem the potential is smooth on particle scales but can exhibit larger scale fluctuations .",
    "it is this last problem which is relevant to the collisionless stellar and dark matter systems , and in this series of papers we concentrate on this problem .    to solve it",
    ", one can either numerically integrate individual particle orbits and measure the properties of the evolved system or appeal to the large-@xmath4 aspect of the problem and attempt to deduce the global properties of the systems , for example , the distribution function . the first approach is taken by the n - body simulations , which in the last couple of decades have produced consistent and robust results for the structure of collisionless dark matter halos ( see @xcite and @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these results are widely used in the literature whenever the properties of dark matter halos are called for .",
    "examples of the second , mostly analytical approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while these do reproduce the general features of collisionless systems , they often use the knowledge of the final system ( for example , the de vaucouleurs profile of ellipticals ) to motivate the choice of the distribution function . since simulations make no such assumptions , and have convincingly demonstrated that the end result of collisionless relaxation is the universal profile , is an analytical derivation even needed ?",
    "we argue that it is . in this series of papers",
    ", we develop an analytical approach , starting from first principles which predicts the properties of relaxed self - gravitating collisionless systems , and test it against numerically evolved systems . in paper i @xcite",
    "we showed that if one uses the techniques of statistical mechanics , and works in energy , or orbit space , instead of the usual phase - space , then the standard entropy maximization procedure yields the most probable state described by an exponential differential energy distribution , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dimensionless ( positive ) energy and the central potential depth , respectively .",
    "for finite potential depths , @xmath4 has to be truncated so that @xmath8 .",
    "an abrupt truncation will lead to an unphysical central density hole ; any gradual transition to zero will lead to small integer occupation numbers in energy cells close to @xmath7 .",
    "( @xcite addressed a similar problem in the case of the distribution function @xmath9 . ) because the standard stirling approximation breaks down at low occupation numbers , we replace it with a superior approximation . with this ,",
    "the most probable energy distribution becomes @xmath3 $ ] , which we call darkexp .",
    "it has only one free parameter , @xmath7 , the depth of the system s central potential , or the energy of the most bound particle .    in this paper",
    "we derive the structural and dynamical properties of these systems , and compare them to the results of a numerically evolved system .",
    "given a distribution function @xmath10 one can integrate it over the velocity space to obtain the density distribution as a function of radius , @xmath11 . however , given a distribution in energy , @xmath12 one",
    "can not obtain @xmath11 in one step .",
    "this is because unlike @xmath10 , @xmath12 contains in it the density of states , and so it already depends on the potential , which is what one is trying to recover .",
    "therefore an iterative procedure is needed , such as the one described in @xcite , which assumes isotropy .",
    "since there is only one free parameter in darkexp , @xmath7 , the density profiles are a function of @xmath7 only ; these are shown in figure  [ slopesall ] , where we plot the logarithmic density slope , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the concept of ` virial radius ' is not defined in these systems , so we chose to normalize the radius to that where the density attains @xmath15 , and call it @xmath16 .",
    "the blue line is the @xcite @xmath17 model , while the two red lines are the nfw @xcite , and the hernquist @xcite profiles , shown for reference .",
    "the corresponding density profiles are plotted in figure  [ density2 ] ; thick lines highlight the radial range accessible to high - resolution numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the red curve is the nfw profile , shown for comparison .",
    "the darkexp family of density profiles has a characteristic shape . at radii larger than @xmath18 ,",
    "i.e. those that can be probed in simulated systems , and for small values of @xmath7 the density profiles get shallower monotonically from large to small radii , but for @xmath7 above @xmath19 the profiles first get shallower until they reach @xmath20 , then stay around @xmath21 for a finite radial range before becoming shallow again .",
    "this type of non - monotonic slope behavior is known to occur in some analytical systems , for example , the isothermal sphere ( @xcite , section 4.4 , figure 4.8 ) , polytropic systems with index @xmath22 around 5 @xcite , and systems where @xmath2 is a power law in radius @xcite . in the case of darkexp ,",
    "the slope of 2 is ` inherited ' from the pure exponential @xmath23 studied by @xcite .",
    "paper i demonstrated analytically that darkexp models must asymptote to a central density cusp of @xmath24 .",
    "figures  [ slopesall ] and [ density2 ] show that inside of @xmath25  darkexp density profiles undergo oscillations in slope .",
    "though the amplitude of oscillations can be large , especially for systems with shallow potentials , they bracket the slope of 1 .",
    "more significantly , because these oscillations involve very little mass and take place in a narrow linear radial interval , any physical system , such as an n - body halo , which exhibits slight deviations from spherical symmetry or has a small amount of substructure , would erase these oscillations , averaging them to the asymptotic slope .",
    "in other words , because the amount of mass involved is small , the difference between the differential energy distribution of oscillating and a similar , but non - oscillating system will be small .",
    "( we note that some numerically generated systems do show small oscillations , see for example , figure  2 of @xcite and figure  7 of @xcite . )",
    "the darkexp systems that happen to have the smallest oscillations , even before the smearing effect of ellipticity or substructure is considered , are those with @xmath7 around 4 , and so the asymptotic slope is already evident at radii somewhat interior to @xmath16 .",
    "curiously , darkexp models that most resemble n - body profiles are also those with @xmath26 ( compare to the red nfw and hernquist profiles , and the blue einasto , or @xcite profiles , in figure  [ slopesall ] ) .",
    "because darkexp makes a definite , one - parameter prediction about the shape of the energy distribution of isotropic systems , and because the corresponding density profiles have a distinct shape , the darkexp model can be tested , using an appropriate numerical scheme . the scheme should satisfy certain criteria .    1 .",
    "it should evolve a self - gravitating system collisionlessly .",
    "2 .   to ensure that the statistical nature of the darkexp is fulfilled",
    "each particle must undergo numerous interactions ( with the potential ) during relaxation .",
    "3 .   it should allow unimpeded energy exchange between the particles and the potential .",
    "4 .   it should not allow the exchange of angular momentum , or @xmath27 , because darkexp does not treat the redistribution of @xmath27 , and it is possible , at least in principle , that in the process of redistributing @xmath27 , the energy distribution will also be affected .",
    "the final halos should be close to isotropic .",
    "the first two criteria are satisfied by the collisionless dark matter n - body simulations , and the fifth one can be fulfilled by selecting nearly isotropic systems from the entire set of virialized halos .",
    "in fact , most simulated halos are close to isotropic , except for the outermost radii .",
    "the third criterion is probably satisfied , but the fourth is not satisfied by standard n - body simulations , because they have tangential forces and hence allow transfer of angular momentum .",
    "for example , formation of bar - like structures or central triaxiality is common in simulations @xcite , and these tend to transfer angular momentum from the inner to the outer halo . a numerical scheme that does satisfy the fourth criterion is the extended secondary infall model , or esim , described in detail in @xcite and @xcite and summarized below .",
    "esim is a geometrically spherically symmetric shell code , where each shells angular and radial actions are held constant throughout the collapse .",
    "the initial conditions , detailed below , need not be cosmological , because the relaxation principles we are investigating are general , and do not hinge on cosmology .",
    "the only shell property that is allowed to change during evolution is its energy .",
    "esim does not calculate forces , instead , at every time step it recalculates each shell s energy , i.e. , solves the equation , @xmath28 $ ] so that it agrees with the halo s potential , which is the sum of the contributions of all the individual shells .",
    "thus , energy redistribution in a collisionless fashion is allowed , while angular momentum redistribution is not , thereby fulfilling criterion ( 4 ) of darkexp models .",
    "a proto - halo is divided into concentric shells ; the collapse proceeds inside - out with the innermost shell detaching from the hubble flow first , reaching turn - around and collapsing .",
    "the second shell follows , etc .  until some final epoch is reached . as each of the hundreds of shells reaches turn - around and collapses , the potential changes and",
    "so the energies of all the interior shells have to be readjusted to satisfy the energy equation .",
    "this repeated shell energy readjustment is what satisfies criterion ( 2 ) of section  [ chosing ] .",
    "we note that unlike many analytical secondary infall models , the esim collapse factor , i.e. , the ratio between the turn - around radius and the final equilibrium radius for a given shell is not pre - set ; the shell finds its apocenter and pericenter that satisfy the energy equation .",
    "there are two types of input for esim : the density profile for the initial proto - halo at an early epoch , and the _ rms _ of the random velocity dispersions . in the original @xcite prescription the density profile shape function is taken from @xcite , and depends on the matter power spectrum , @xmath29 .",
    "the _ rms _ of the random velocities are calculated based on @xmath29 .    in this paper",
    "the two types of inputs are not derived from a cosmological @xmath29 . for a given shell the magnitude of the random velocity",
    "is picked randomly from a maxwellian distribution having the specified _",
    "rms _ , and the splitting between radial and tangential directions is done randomly .",
    "these random velocity components are imparted to the shell at turn - around , @xmath30 .",
    "the tangential component gives the shell s angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath31 , and the radial component is added to the radial velocity developed through collapse .    to test darkexp",
    ", we need nearly isotropic systems .",
    "esim halo evolution drives halos toward isotropy , but full isotropy usually can not be achieved , because of the constraint that all shells keep their @xmath32 s fixed . to satisfy criterion ( 4 ) of section  [ chosing ]",
    "we generate a large number of halos by varying the two initial conditions , the density and _ rms _ velocity dispersion profiles of proto - halos , evolving them , and then selecting the final halos that are close to isotropic .",
    "we did not try to generate systems that would resemble n - body halos ( or have @xmath7 near 4 ) , instead we wanted our halos to span the broadest range of darkexp profile behavior .",
    "we use five esim halos ; their initial conditions are shown in figure  [ props ] .",
    "the top panel has the density profiles , while the bottom has the angular momentum distribution , @xmath33 .",
    "the density profiles represented by the long and short dashed lines in the upper panel correspond to @xmath33 distributions of the same line type .",
    "the solid line density profile was evolved using three different @xmath33 s represented by solid lines in the bottom panel .",
    "three of the initial @xmath33 profiles ( long dashed , short dashed , and one of the solid lines ) follow the original @xcite prescription , while the remaining two solid line @xmath33 s are modified to generate intermediate values of @xmath7 in the final halos .",
    "before we proceed , we point out that most physical collapse and relaxation schemes designed to test darkexp predictions will be limited to some degree",
    ". the limitations of n - body simulations were already pointed out . in esim , it is impossible to strictly comply with criteria ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of section  [ chosing ] simultaneously .",
    "since the halos are not allowed to redistribute their angular momentum among shells , this indirectly imposes restrictions on how well the energy can be redistributed .",
    "for example , a shell which was endowed with a large @xmath32 as its initial condition can not come close to the halo center , and thus can not have energy arbitrarily close to @xmath7 . consequently , energy can not be redistributed completely freely , and condition ( 3 ) may not be fully satisfied in all halos .",
    "figure  [ esimne ] shows the energy distributions of five evolved esim halos described above .",
    "each halo was fit with darkexp @xmath34 , with two free parameters , the normalization and temperature , @xmath35 , and the fits are shown as curves . and @xmath36 , and also @xmath37 , to denote dimensional quantities , and lower case symbols , such as @xmath6 and @xmath38 , for dimensionless quantities . ] the normalization parameter is related to the total mass of the halo , and is irrelevant here . in the figure the normalization was set arbitrarily , to space out the curves evenly .",
    "the only relevant parameter is @xmath39 .",
    "the fitting is done over the energy range @xmath40 to @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is the energy of the most bound shell , and @xmath41 is the energy where esim halos begin to deviate from a straight line in the @xmath42 $ ] vs. @xmath43 plot .",
    "this choice is somewhat , but not too arbitrary ; figure  [ esimne ] shows that for any given halo the deviation starts relatively abruptly . for plotting purposes ,",
    "the energy scale of each halo was multiplied by @xmath39 , so the horizontal axis is in dimensionless units of @xmath44 , and @xmath39 is different for each halo .",
    "it is apparent that esim energy distributions are very well fit by darkexp .",
    "the deviations are seen at large @xmath45 , i.e. , for loosely bound shells which inhabit the outer , not yet equilibrated portions of halos . for most esim halos",
    "the darkexp fit is valid for a wide enough range of energies and @xmath34 , so that the best - fitting function is , unmistakably , @xmath3 $ ] .    to illustrate this point we compare in figure  [ smneif9811 ] the @xmath46 esim halo ( empty points ) from figure  [ esimne ] to the prediction of the scattering model proposed by @xcite .",
    "their @xmath12 goes approximately as @xmath47^{-1}\\exp(-\\beta e)$ ] .",
    "the two extremes of this function are shown as the short dashed ( magenta ) line in the limit where @xmath48 , and long dashed ( magenta ) line in the limit where @xmath49 .",
    "both fail to match esim halos .",
    "was obtained in their analysis .",
    "inspection of their figure 2 shows that the @xmath48 , case is more appropriate .",
    "if parameter @xmath50 can be chosen arbitrarily , then good fits to esim halos are possible , as might be expected because the model has one more degree of freedom .",
    "]    we also compare darkexp to another physically motivated model of halo formation .",
    "non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite predict collisionless systems to be polytropes @xcite , which have distribution functions that are power laws in energy , with a cutoff at the most bound energy ( @xcite , eq .",
    "4 - 105 ) .",
    "the distribution function of the central regions of darkexp is also a truncated power law ( paper i , eq .",
    "21 ) , but the exponent is @xmath51 , while polytropes have @xmath52 . in the outer regions both polytropes and darkexp density profiles are approximately power laws in radius , but",
    "the transition between the inner and outer slope is much faster in polytropes than in the darkexp systems .",
    "overall , darkexp is quite different from polytropes .",
    "note that the initial , pre - collapse shape of the esim energy distribution is very different from the final , so the goodness of the darkexp fit is not the result of ( un)luckily chosen initial conditions .",
    "the filled points in figure  [ smneif9811 ] show the initial energy distribution of the @xmath46  esim halo .",
    "it is much narrower than the final distribution and is linear in energy ; also the potential depth of the pre - collapse halo , @xmath53 , is considerably shallower than that of the final .",
    "the initial conditions of the other four halos are similar .    because esim is a shell code with the proto - halo shell thickness increasing outward logarithmically , the mass resolution is considerably better in the inner regions than in the outer .",
    "the portions of the energy distribution histogram with energies near most bound typically have a few hundred ( relatively low mass ) shells in each bin , so the region in @xmath34 which matters most for comparison with darkexp has the highest resolution .",
    "this is not so for n - body codes , where each particle has equal mass .",
    "the inset in figure  [ esimne ] shows that near the most bound energies the distribution is linear , as is expected from darkexp , @xmath54 .",
    "in addition to the energy distribution , one can also do the comparison with the density and velocity distributions . because darkexp @xmath34 is dimensionless ( for example , the virial radius",
    ", @xmath55 has no meaning in darkexp ) , and esim quantities are dimensional ( @xmath55 is clearly defined ) , we first have to put these on the same footing .",
    "to that end , we estimate the dimensionless potential depth @xmath7 for each esim halo using @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the energy of the least bound shell .",
    "what energy represents the least bound shell is not clear ; potential differences are readily known , but not absolute potential values .",
    "we estimate @xmath58 as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the typical energy of particles at the radius where the average interior density is 200 times the critical , and @xmath41 is defined in section  [ energy ] .",
    "note that @xmath61 is always less than @xmath62 , implying that esim halos are not equilibrated up to the virial radius .",
    "given this estimate of @xmath7 , we can check how well the esim density profiles reproduce the corresponding darkexp @xmath11 .",
    "the two should match reasonably well , but perfect agreement is not expected because ( i ) some esim halos do not follow darkexp @xmath34 for a wide energy range ( see section  [ esimsum ] ) , ( ii ) estimating @xmath57 is not rigorous , and ( iii ) none of the esim halos are perfectly isotropic .",
    "all five halos are shown in figure  [ lnrgamma2 ] , against the background of darkexp models with @xmath7 values from 2 to 10 , in steps of 0.5 ; the ones fitting the five esim halos are shown as thicker lines .",
    "as for @xmath34 , the darkexp models provide very good fits to most of the esim halo density profiles .",
    "esim halos with the shallower potentials do not match darkexp predictions as well as the ones with deeper potentials .",
    "this could be because the shallower halos do not undergo as much change in the potential during the evolution , and hence do not relax fully .",
    "the second ( @xmath46 ) and the fourth ( @xmath63 ) of the five profiles of figure  [ esimne ] are shown in figures  [ esimdark9811 ] and [ esimdark2601 ] , where we plot @xmath64 of the esim halos ( black lines with noise ) , and the best - fitting darkexp curve ( red smooth lines ) .",
    "the radii are in units of @xmath16 , but the vertical normalization is arbitrary , so only the shapes of the curves are to be compared .",
    "the halo with the deeper potential ( figure  [ esimdark9811 ] ) closely follows the darkexp prediction for nearly four decades in radius , whereas the shallower one , does so for only two decades , and deviations become pronounced in the outer halo .",
    "we note that these density profile shapes , especially for the deeper potentials , like in figure  [ esimdark9811 ] , where the density slope stays roughly constant for a finite radial range were already evident in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "we use the isotropic jeans equation to obtain the velocity dispersion profile for each halo , shown as thin lines in figures  [ esimdark9811 ] and [ esimdark2601 ] .",
    "note that the darkexp   @xmath65 shape tracks the density profiles shape , ensuring that @xmath2 ( the top smooth line ) stays close to a power law for @xmath66 decades in radius .",
    "the reason for the pseudo phase - space density , @xmath2 being a power law in collisionless simulations is still not known , but it is reassuring that darkexp models predict this feature .    in figure  [ esimdark9811 ] , while the esim density profile is very well fit by darkexp , the shape of the velocity dispersion profile , @xmath65 , which we define as @xmath67 $ ] , deviates from darkexp predictions because of esim s non - zero anisotropy , @xmath68 .",
    "the top set of curves shows @xmath2 , which also deviate somewhat from darkexp predictions , again , because of anisotropy .",
    "because the sole dynamical action of the esim is to repeatedly readjust shells energies in response to the changing potential , it is well suited for testing the darkexp predictions described in paper i @xcite .",
    "this constant reshuffling of energies drives halos to the most probable , darkexp state .",
    "the more realistic numerical schemes , like the n - body simulations are also more complex in the sense that they do more than just redistribute particle energies , they also affect the redistribution of angular momentum . whether the inclusion of this additional degree of freedom will preserve the darkexp @xmath34 form is not yet clear .",
    "we speculate that the changes , at least in the inner portions of halos will be minor because n - body halos are fully relaxed and isotropic in those regions .",
    "the argument presented in paper i does not rely on any specific process , like infalling substructure or dynamical friction , to achieve the final state ; it is a maximum entropy argument .",
    "if the same principle applies to the redistribution of angular momentum in collisionless simulations of dark matter halos , then the final @xmath69 distribution can also be arrived at similarly , without knowing the details of the radial orbit , or other tangential instabilities that operate in simulations .",
    "encouraged by the success of our isotropic investigations we will pursue the statistical mechanical approach , and apply it to anisotropic systems .",
    "the dark cosmology centre is funded by the danish national research foundation .",
    "is very grateful for the hospitality of the dark cosmology centre at the university of copenhagen , and the institute for theoretical physics at the university of zrich , where she spent the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2010 , respectively ."
