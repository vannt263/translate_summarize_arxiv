    "in all matter , the physical state of the material can be described in terms of the translational and rotational motion of the constituent molecules . in a crystalline solid",
    "the intermolecular forces hinder motion and force the molecules to lie , on average , in a regular array ( i.e.  in a crystal lattice structure ) .",
    "as the substance is heated the molecules gain kinetic energy and large molecular vibrations break the crystal structure resulting in a fluid phase . in the liquid fluid phase",
    "the intermolecular forces are still strong over the average distance between molecules but can not maintain the crystal structure . in the gas fluid phase the average distance between molecules is large , the intermolecular forces are weak and the unrestricted motion of the molecules cause the gas to expand and fill the container holding it .    in certain materials ,",
    "which typically consist of either rod - like or disc - like molecules , it is not just the translational motion , i.e.  the motion of positions of the centres of mass of the molecules , which determines the state of matter .",
    "we must also consider the orientation of the rod- or disc - like molecules . in a `` normal '' liquid , or more correctly , an isotropic liquid ,",
    "the orientation of the molecule is random . if we pick a single molecule and consider how the orientation varies with time it will eventually take all possible orientations . alternatively ,",
    "if we look in a small region of the material ( say a fixed ball , @xmath1 , centred at the point @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ phases](a ) ) , then the molecules in the ball will be randomly oriented .",
    "such a system , in which a time average is equivalent to a space average , is said to be _",
    "ergodic_.    however , in a temperature region between the isotropic liquid and crystal states , some materials exhibit an amount of orientational order .",
    "that is , if we look in the small ball @xmath3 the orientation is not random , rather there exists an average orientation , see fig .",
    "[ phases](b ) .",
    "materials which exhibit such orientational order are called _ liquid crystals_.     in ( a ) the isotropic liquid phase and ( b ) the nematic liquid crystal phase . due to the head - tail symmetry of the molecules , the order parameter integration need",
    "only be performed over the half sphere @xmath4 or @xmath5.,width=302 ]      for such a situation we can define a unit vector @xmath6 called the _ director _ to be the average molecular orientation direction . for rod - like ( or calamitic ) molecules this will be the average long axis orientation and for disc - like ( discotic ) molecules it will be the average orientation of the disc normal . if we consider a different region in the material the director @xmath6 may be in a different direction . this director may also vary with time and so it is a variable which is dependent on both space and time coordinates , @xmath7 . we can also measure the _ amount _ of orientational order about this average direction , in the small ball @xmath3 .",
    "if we consider all the molecules in @xmath3 and construct a probability distribution of the molecular orientations then the mean of this distribution is the director orientation but we can also compute , for instance , the standard deviation of the distribution . this would measure how spread out the molecular orientation distribution is .",
    "however , rather than the standard deviation of this distribution , the usual measure of this amount of order is the _ scalar order parameter _",
    ", usually denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "this is a weighted average of the molecular orientation angles @xmath9 between the long molecular axes and the director @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the thermal or statistical average so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the statistical distribution function of the molecular angle @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ dist1 ] shows typical statistical distribution functions @xmath13 for two cases , high orientational order and low orientational order .",

    "denotes the angle between a molecule and the director and @xmath13 is the probability of finding a molecule with orientation @xmath9 in the small region @xmath3 then for a highly ordered system , @xmath13 has a small standard deviation .",
    "( b)low orientational order : we can still define the average orientation , i.e.  the mean of @xmath13 but in this case the molecules have more energy and the orientational distribution is more spread out .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath13 is larger.,width=566 ]    in the ball @xmath3 each molecular orientation can be described by the vector parallel to the molecular long axis or alternatively a point on the surface of a half unit sphere , the point which the molecule `` points at '' on the sphere .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ sdef2 ] ) may therefore be performed over half the boundary of the sphere , @xmath15 say in fig .",
    "[ phases](b ) .",
    "and azimuthal angle @xmath16 . the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes are locally defined and are not the laboratory frame of reference.,width=188 ]    an even function of @xmath9 must be used in eq .",
    "( [ sdef1 ] ) because , since @xmath13 is an even function , any odd function of @xmath9 would lead to zero upon integration in eq .",
    "( [ sdef2 ] ) . to leading order",
    "this function is a good approximate measure of the orientational order although a more accurate measure would include higher order polynomials of @xmath20 .",
    "equation  ( [ sdef1 ] ) is in fact the second order legendre polynomial , @xmath21 , and it is usual to use the higher order even legendre polynomials @xmath22 when greater accuracy is required .    when the material is crystalline all molecules align exactly with the director and so @xmath23 for all molecules , which means that @xmath24 and , from eq .",
    "( [ sdef1 ] ) , @xmath25 .",
    "when all molecules lie in the plane perpendicular to the director , but randomly oriented in that plane , then the average still leads to the same director but @xmath26 for all molecules so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the isotropic liquid phase the molecules are randomly oriented and so @xmath13 is constant and equal to @xmath29 ( which can be derived from the property of probability distributions that @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , performing the integration in eq .",
    "( [ sdef2 ] ) in spherical coordinates where @xmath9 is the angle between the molecule and the director and @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle , i.e.  the angle between a fixed direction in the plane perpendicular to the director and the projection of the director onto that plane ( see fig .",
    "[ onemol ] ) , we obtain ( using the substitution @xmath31 on the second line ) , @xmath32 and so @xmath33 and from eq .",
    "( [ sdef1 ] ) , @xmath34 .",
    "although it is possible to achieve a molecular configuration for which @xmath8 is negative , i.e.  @xmath35 , it is more usual that in the equilibrium liquid crystal state the scalar order parameter is positive , @xmath36 . as the temperature of the material changes",
    "the scalar order parameter will change from @xmath34 in the isotropic state , at high temperature , to @xmath25 in the crystalline state , at low temperature .",
    "a typical scalar order parameter in the middle of the phase region , for this type of liquid crystal , might be @xmath37 .",
    "the fundamental principle of any biaxial system is that there is no axis of complete rotational symmetry ( i.e no axis about which a rotation of _ any _ angle leaves the system unchanged ) , unlike a uniaxial system which has an axes of rotational symmetry ( such as the director @xmath6 in uniaxial liquid crystals ) . for instance , some solid materials ( i.e.  calcite ) are uniaxial , and therefore birefringent , so that light travelling along the optical axis sees a different refractve index than light travelling perpendicular to the optic axis .",
    "however , other materials are biaxial ( i.e.  olivine ) , and have trirefringence , where there are three different refractive indices , for light travelling along three orthogonal directions .    for such biaxial materials there can be defined a set of perpendicular axes ( only two need to be defined as the third is then specified as perpendicular to the other two ) for each of which there is a reflection symmetry .",
    "in biaxial liquid crystals the two axes @xmath6 and @xmath38 are therefore defined and the symmetries are the reflections @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the definition of three axes of reflective symmetry in a material is a relatively straightforward concept .",
    "less straightforward is to understand the molecular arrangement corresponding to a biaxial systems .",
    "there are two possibilities for the shape of the molecules : either the molecules are uniaxial or they are biaxial .",
    "a uniaxial molecule can be thought of as shaped like a cylinder or rod ( uniaxial because there is a rotation symmetry about the axis of the molecule ) , a biaxial molecule might be shaped like a plank of wood .",
    "there is no rotation axis along the long axis of the plank ( rotating the plank changes its configuration ) but there are three axes of reflective symmetry ( the long , intermediate and short axis of the plank )",
    ".    we can now have a uniaxial or biaxial arrangement of uniaxial molecules and a uniaxial or biaxial arrangement of biaxial molecules .",
    "the easiest arrangements to imagine are the uniaxial arrangement of uniaxial molecules - a group of cylindrical molecules oriented , on average , along a single direction where rotation about this direction does not alter , at least statistically speaking , the arrangement - and also the biaxial arrangement of biaxial molecules , a group of plank - shaped molecules where the long axes of the planks align in one direction and the short axes also align , in a second direction , so creating a biaxial ensemble arrangement .",
    "a uniaxial arrangement of biaxial molecules is also relatively easy to imagine . in this arrangement",
    "the molecular long axes orient as before but the short axes of the plank are oriented randomly so that , if we view from the side as in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , at any moment in time some of the planks are facing out of the page and some are turned end on .",
    "when you rotate the system the individual molecules look different but on average the same proportion of molecules are face on and end on ( and all orientations in between ) .    a more difficult situation to imagine",
    "is a biaxial arrangement of uniaxial molecules .",
    "such an alignment is described below and is the most relevant to the liquid crystal structure at the centre of defects .",
    "imagine a group of uniaxial molecules ( the cylindrical or rod - like molecules ) which are in a uniaxial arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ uniax ] ) if you look down the director ( the @xmath19 axis ) the molecules , which are now viewed almost end - on , look random , it is only the side view ( along the @xmath17 or @xmath18 axis ) which indicates the director @xmath6 .",
    "now restrict this group of molecules by `` squashing '' the distribution within the ball ( see fig .",
    "[ biax ] ) between two imaginary plane surfaces parallel to the @xmath41 plane , and look along the @xmath19 axis again .",
    "there will be a restriction of the motion of the molecules in fig .",
    "[ uniax](c ) to an arrangement similar to fig .",
    "[ biax](c ) .    in more mathematical terminology : in the ball @xmath3 , if the distribution of molecules is such that the zenithal angles @xmath9 vary between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the azimuthal angles vary between @xmath44 and @xmath45 then the three views of the group of molecules along the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes are shown in fig .  [",
    "biax](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively . if we look at the molecules along the @xmath18-axis ( fig .",
    "[ biax](b ) ) the extent of the zenithal angle is @xmath46 and we can define a scalar order parameter @xmath47 . if we look at the molecules along the @xmath19-axis ( fig .  [",
    "biax](c ) ) the extent of the azimuthal angle is @xmath48 and we can define a scalar order parameter @xmath49 say .",
    "if we look along the @xmath17-axis ( fig .  [ biax](a ) ) , the restriction to the azimuthal angle means we see an effective zenithal angle range which is smaller than in fig .",
    "[ biax](a ) .",
    "simple geometry gives us that the _ effective _ range of zenithal angles is now @xmath50 therefore , with this view , we would calculate a different scalar order parameter , @xmath51 say which is larger than @xmath47 ( in fact @xmath51 is related to @xmath47 and @xmath49 ) .     or @xmath18-axes the molecular distribution is similar and the calculated scalar order parameter is identical .",
    "viewed along the director , the @xmath19-axis , the molecules are viewed virtually end - on and the distribution looks isotropic.,width=340 ]        it is now necessary to define three directors and corresponding scalar order parameters .",
    "if we take two perpendicular directors @xmath6 and @xmath38 , in our situation the @xmath19 and @xmath18 directions , then we can define the two scalar order parameters @xmath47 and @xmath49 associated with order about the two directors respectively ( the third director being @xmath52 ) .",
    "if the order parameter @xmath49 is non - zero and not equal to @xmath47 the liquid crystal is said to be _ biaxial _ , i.e.  there are two axes of symmetry . if , however , @xmath49=0 then in comparison to fig .",
    "[ biax](c ) the range of azimuthal angles is now @xmath53 and a view along the @xmath19-axis shows randomly oriented molecules ( see fig .",
    "[ uniax ] ) .",
    "the view from the @xmath17-axis will show a regular nematic distribution of molecules and the director and a non - zero order parameter @xmath47 can be defined .",
    "since the system of molecules is now rotationally symmetric about the @xmath19-axis , the view along the @xmath18 axis will be the same as that along the @xmath17-axis and thus the order parameter will again be @xmath47 .    from these examples we see that the uniaxial nematic state exists when the order parameter with respect to one direction is zero , or equivalently the order parameters with respect to the perpendicular directions are the same .",
    "the biaxial nematic state exists when the scalar order parameters in all three perpendicular directions are different .",
    "it should be mentioned that a stable biaxial thermotropic nematic liquid crystal has only recently been reported ( after over 50 years of searching ) .",
    "many attempts to synthesise such a material , mainly using flat , board - like molecules , have failed and it seems that bent - core molecules have provided the solution @xcite .",
    "the biaxial state is certainly important since certain external forces such as surfaces in contact with the liquid crystal , electric fields and some topological constraints can induce a biaxial state in regions of a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal sample .    in this paper",
    "we will only consider an ensemble of rod - like ( i.e. uniaxial ) molecules which , as mentioned above , may form a uniaxial or biaxial configuration .",
    "consideration of an ensemble of plank - like or bent core ( i.e. biaxial ) molecules is more complicated and involves a second order tensor @xmath54 to describe the ordering of the short molecular axes .",
    "such a theory is detailed in sonnet and virga @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the most general nematic state is the biaxial state which can be described by two vector - valued variables and two scalar - valued variables , the directors @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the scalar order parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , all of which may depend on the spatial coordinates @xmath2 and time .    we assume , without loss of generality , that the directors are of unit length , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .     and @xmath38 in terms of the euler angles @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the axes @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 form the laboratory frame of reference.,width=151 ]    just as we have described each molecule in fig .",
    "[ onemol ] , each of these directors can be represented in terms of the standard euler angles , see fig .",
    "[ director ] .",
    "since the director @xmath6 is of unit length it can be written as , @xmath67 it is important not to confuse the director angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 with the molecular angles in fig .",
    "[ onemol ] . the molecular angles @xmath9 and @xmath16 are angles relative to a local frame of reference , i.e.  the directors , whereas the angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 are defined relative to the laboratory frame of reference , i.e a set of axes fixed in space , independent of the orientation of the material .",
    "the director @xmath38 is perpendicular to @xmath6 and therefore has one remaining degree of freedom , the angle @xmath63 , @xmath68 the angle @xmath63 is the angle from @xmath38 to the direction @xmath69 in the @xmath70-plane which is also perpendicular to @xmath6 .",
    "a theory can now be constructed using the _ five _ dependent variables , @xmath71 however , there may be problems with a theory such as this , based on euler angles .",
    "when the zenithal angle @xmath61 equals @xmath72 the azimuthal angle @xmath62 is undefined and , as with all such angle variables , there may also be a problem with multi - valuedness since @xmath73 is equivalent to @xmath74 .",
    "care must be taken when solving governing differential equations for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we now define an alternative approach which removes the problems of the angle representation described above . instead of defining the nematic state in terms of the five separate variables in eq .",
    "( [ vars ] ) we construct a 3x3 matrix which contains all the information about the nematic state , i.e.  the information contained in the five variables .",
    "the problems of solving the euler angle governing equations will be removed with this approach ( for reference see for example @xcite ) .",
    "consider the 3x3 matrix , @xmath75 where , for any vector @xmath76 the @xmath77 element of the product @xmath78 is @xmath79 , the @xmath80 element of @xmath76 multiplied by the @xmath81 element of @xmath76 .",
