    "recently , psr  j1814@xmath01744 , an isolated radio pulsar with period @xmath2  s and large period derivative ( @xmath3 ) was discovered ( camilo et al . 2000 , see also manchester et al .",
    "2000 and kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) in an ongoing survey of the galactic plane for radio pulsars using the 64-m parkes telescope ( lyne et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the pulsar s surface magnetic field strength @xmath4 , inferred under the assumption of a dipole rotating _ in vacuo _ ( @xcite ) from @xmath5 is @xmath1  g.    this pulsar s properties are particularly interesting because they are similar to those of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "axps have spin periods @xmath6  s , and spin down regularly ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) with period derivatives @xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of axps are typically several orders of magnitude larger than their spin - down luminosities @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the pulsar s moment of inertia , assumed to be @xmath10  g  @xmath11 ) ( see , e.g. , oosterbroek et al . 1998 and references therein ) . strong observational evidence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) precludes accretion from a binary companion as the origin of the observed x - rays . instead",
    ", the leading hypothesis to explain axp properties is that they are isolated neutron stars with ultra - high magnetic fields , so - called `` magnetars '' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray emission is powered either by decay of the large magnetic field ( @xcite ) or neutron star cooling enhanced by the presence of the strong field ( heyl & hernquist 1997a ) .",
    "assuming magnetic dipole braking , axps have inferred surface dipole magnetic field strengths @xmath12  g.    while psr  j1814@xmath01744  is a radio pulsar and hence an isolated neutron star , its spin parameters and hence inferred magnetic field are extreme in the pulsar population : its magnetic field is nearly three times larger than that of psr  b0154@xmath1361 ( arzoumanian et al .",

    "given that the spin parameters of psr  j1814@xmath01744  are more typical of axps than radio pulsars , the possibility that this is a transition object between these two neutron star populations must be entertained . in particular , under the magnetar hypothesis ,",
    "the mechanism responsible for the production of x - rays in axps should be present in psr  j1814@xmath01744  if the inferred magnetic field is indeed the primary characteristic relevant to the observed magnetar properties .    the similarity in spin parameters between psr j1814@xmath01744 and the axps is readily seen in a `` @xmath15@xmath0@xmath16 '' plot .",
    "figure  1 shows @xmath16 versus @xmath15 for the radio pulsar population ( small dots ) , with psr  j1814@xmath01744  indicated .",
    "the figure also shows the candidate magnetar population , consisting of five axps and two soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "immediately noticeable is the proximity of psr  j1814@xmath01744  to the cluster of axps and sgrs at the upper right corner .",

    "count rate limits from both observations are used to derive an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity from psr  j1814@xmath01744  that is significantly smaller than those measured for the known axps .",
    "we then discuss the implications of the non - detection for current magnetar models .",
    "a field containing psr  j1814@xmath01744   was observed with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) instrument aboard _ rosat _  ( trmper 1983 ) during 1992  april  28 , as part of a study of the galactic x - ray background ( sequence rp900196n00 ) .",

    "a field containing psr  j1814@xmath01744  was observed with _ asca _",
    "( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) on 1996  april  9 , as part of a galactic plane survey ( sequence 54005040 ) .",

    "this puts the source at the edge of the sis detectors , limiting the utility of these data .",

    ", we restricted the image to a circular fov with @xmath46 radius .",
    "the image is dominated by scattered flux from the nearby ( @xmath25 ) bright low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) gx  13@xmath131 ( vrtilek et al .",
    "1991 ) . due to its better mirror performance ,",

    "no x - ray emission is present from the location of the radio pulsar .",

    "asca_. fortuitously , psr  j1814@xmath01744  is situated in the middle of the boundary shadow , largely shielding the location of the pulsar from the scattered flux of gx  13@xmath131 .",
    "however , the contamination of nearly the entire gis fov from the lmxb complicates the choice of a background region .",
    "we considered using blank - sky data from the same region of the detectors that encompass the source aperture , which would account for the instrumental and cosmic x - ray backgrounds .",
    "however , the blank - sky background would not include contributions from the diffuse galactic plane emission , and most importantly , would not include the scattered flux from gx  13@xmath131 .",
    "hence , we relied upon a relatively contamination - free region from this observation to calculate the background , selecting a circular region with @xmath28 radius , located the same distance off - axis as psr  j1814@xmath01744  and containing roughly the same amount of scattered light as the source aperture . requiring @xmath49@xmath40 yields a count rate upper limit in the @xmath50  kev band of @xmath51  cps .",
    "these calculations were performed on the unbinned data , and while our approach should mitigate most of the effects of the contamination from gx  13@xmath131 , we recognize it is impossible to fully account for it .",
    "the above upper limit represents a conservative estimate of the maximum count rate from psr  j1814@xmath01744 .",
    "the dependence of the magnetar hypothesis for axp emission on inferred magnetic field , coupled with the similarities in the spin parameters of psr j1814@xmath01744 and 1e  2259@xmath13586 , suggests that psr j1814@xmath01744 may also share similar x - ray properties . here",

    ", we must first estimate the galactic absorption ( column density @xmath60 ) and distance to the radio pulsar .",
    "there are two coarse , yet independent , methods for estimating @xmath61 .",
    "the seward & wang ( 1988 ) approximation of 10 neutral hydrogen atoms per free electron , combined with the pulsar dispersion measure dm  = 834  pc  @xmath62 ( camilo et al . 2000 ) gives @xmath63  @xmath55 .",
    "the ftool nh , which uses the hi maps of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , predicts @xmath64  @xmath55 .",
    "the dm@xmath0@xmath65 relationship of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) predicts a distance of @xmath6610  kpc . at this distance ,",

    "figure  2 shows the expected count rates in both the _ rosat _  pspc and the _ asca _  gis as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "the rates were calculated by using xspec ( v.10 ) to fold the spectrum of 1e  2259@xmath13586 , normalized to a distance of 10  kpc , through the appropriate instrument response matrices .",

    "the dashed lines in each plot represent the measured upper limits . even when @xmath61 is allowed to exceed the maximum estimate , the predicted count rates are well above the measured upper limits . assuming a reasonable compromise value for the column density of @xmath69  @xmath55 , the expected _ rosat",

    "extrapolating the _ rosat_-derived upper limit to the _ asca _ band gives @xmath72  ergs  s@xmath18 , in good agreement with the _",
    "asca_-derived limit .",
    "next , we comment on the use of the spectral properties of 1e  2259@xmath13586  for calculating our luminosity upper limit for psr  j1814@xmath01744 .",
    "the spectral properties determined for axps are very similar , with power law photon indices in the range @xmath73 and black body temperatures in the span @xmath74  kev ( 1e  2259@xmath13586 : rho & petre 1997 ; 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 : oosterbroek et al 1998 ; 1e  1841@xmath0045 : vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ; + rx  j170849.0@xmath0400910 : sugizaki et al 1997 ; 4u  0142@xmath1361 : white et al 1996 ) .",
    "their x - ray luminosities ( @xmath75  kev ) differ significantly , however , varying by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "calculations identical to those described above show that if psr  j1814@xmath01744  had properties like the other known axps , the expected count rates would all be greater than those predicted from assuming the spectrum and luminosity of 1e  2259@xmath13586 .",
    "we note that only axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ( inferred surface magnetic field strength @xmath76  g , @xcite ) nominally yields a lower expected count rate than the 1e  2259@xmath13586  model ( though still higher than our upper limit ) , although the particularly large uncertainty in the distance of the former makes its true intrinsic luminosity difficult to know ( corbet & mihara 1997 ) .",
    "thus , if the measured spectral parameters for any of the other axps ( with the possible exception of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ) were used in interpreting the count rate upper limit for psr  j1814@xmath01744 , the difference between its x - ray luminosity upper limit and the luminosity expected from axp - like emission would only increase .",
    "one scenario that must be considered for the lack of emission from psr  j1814@xmath01744  is that the magnetar mechanism is present and emitting x - rays that are beamed away from our line of sight . the small number of confirmed axps prevents any detailed statistical discussion of beaming .",
    "however , the pulsed fraction and pulse shape of the known axps can be used to motivate at least a rough characterization . for each axp ,",
    "table  2 lists the pulsed fraction _",
    "f _ , the passband and the pulse shape . here ,",
    "we follow page ( 1995 ) and estimate the pulsed fraction using @xmath77 , where the subscript refers to the maximum , minimum , and mean counts in the pulse profile .",
    "all axps have large unpulsed components and have pulse profiles with smooth or sinusoidal shapes , independent of the number of x - ray pulses present .",
    "another general trend is that , excepting 4u  0142@xmath1361 , there is no evidence for appreciable pulse shape evolution with energy .    these properties are consistent with the predictions of both magnetar models : that pulsed emission from axps is best interpreted as smoothly modulated thermal emission from the surface of the neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "see @xmath473.3 for additional discussion .",
    "the pulsed high energy component ( @xmath78 kev ) , well fit by a power - law model , raises the possibility that non - thermal magnetospheric processes may also contribute .",
    "the lack of axp pulse evolution with energy , however , suggests that only a single x - ray emission mechanism is present in axps .",
    "this is in contrast to rotation - powered pulsars like the vela pulsar , which has a soft , sinusoidal thermal component with low pulsed fraction ( @xcite ) and a sharply peaked non - thermal component that extends above 100  mev ( strickman , harding , & de jager 1999 ) .",
    "of course , axps and rotation - powered pulsars could have very different pulsed properties , given the uncertainty in the origin of high - energy magnetospheric emission or the effect that a high magnetic field would have on this mechanism .",
    "for example , distinct thermal and non - thermal components could be present yet , for reasons unexplained , are locked in phase , thus appearing to have a common origin .    in either magnetar model ,",
    "the x - ray emission comes from the hot neutron star surface .",
    "thus , it seems improbable that psr  j1814@xmath01744  would be oriented with respect to our line of sight as to make x - ray pulsations undetectable , especially considering that gravitational lensing can make much more than half of the neutron star surface visible ( see , e.g. , page 1995 and heyl & hernquist 1998 ) .",
    "note , however , any magnetospheric emission would be too distant from the neutron star surface to undergo gravitational lensing , hence could be beamed .",
    "but even if psr  j1814@xmath01744  were aligned in such a way , considerable unpulsed x - ray emission would be present , as is the case of all the known members of the axp population ( see table  2 ) .",
    "for example , the unpulsed luminosity of 1e  1841@xmath0045 is @xmath6685% of the total observed luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "even if half of the flux is present in pulsations directed away from our line of sight , the expected count rates from psr  j1814@xmath01744  are still well above the upper limits derived from the archival data .",
    "we conclude that , even in the unlikely event that the x - ray emission is significantly beamed , psr  j1814@xmath01744  should have been detectable as an x - ray point source under the magnetar hypothesis .    finally , we discuss the ramifications of source variability in axps .",
    "torii et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report variations in flux greater than a factor of ten in the axp candidate ax  j1844.8@xmath00258 .",
    "recent observations by vasisht , gotthelf , torii , & gaensler ( 2000 ) confirm the extreme variability of this object .",
    "if this source is firmly established as an axp by an accurate @xmath16 measurement and psr  j1814@xmath01744  has similar characteristics , there exists the possibility that both serendipitous observations of psr  j1814@xmath01744  occurred during a low - state and that it is , in fact , an x - ray source . if instead psr  j1814@xmath01744  undergoes variability by a factor of @xmath79 , as witnessed in 1e  2259@xmath13586  ( corbet et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) and 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ( corbet & mihara 1997 ) , x - ray emission still would have been detected .",
    "x - ray emission from axps has been explained in the context of the magnetar model by either magnetic field decay ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) or neutron star cooling ( heyl & hernquist 1997a ) .",
    "duncan & thompson ( 1992 ) first posited the existence of magnetars to explain a subset of gamma - ray bursts , including those from the sgrs . later",
    "( see , e.g. , duncan & thompson 1994 and thompson & duncan 1995 ) , they discuss how the 1979  march  5 event from sgr  0526@xmath066 , which released @xmath66@xmath80  ergs in @xmath660.2  s ( @xcite and @xcite ) , could have been driven by a large - scale instability and subsequent readjustment of the neutron star s magnetic field . for the time scale relevant to the system ( @xmath6610@xmath81  yr )",
    ", they argue that the instability is best explained by ambipolar diffusion of the magnetic field out of the stellar core ( @xcite ) .",
    "this process conducts energy from the core to the surface to produce x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath82  ergs  s@xmath18 .",
    "the strong dependence of the surface heat flux on field strength concentrates flux in the polar regions .",
    "the modulation of this intensity gradient gives rise to the x - ray pulsations .    for 1e  2259 + 586",
    ", this mechanism can explain the observed x - rays if the neutron star s characteristic age , @xmath83  kyr , is an overestimate , the true age being @xmath84  kyr , that inferred for the proposed associated supernova remnant ctb  109 ( wang et al .",
    "if this model is correct , the difference of only 10% in the magnetic fields of 1e  2259 + 586 and psr  j1814@xmath01744  seems unlikely to account for the large difference in their x - ray luminosities , given the similarity of the x - ray emission from the known axps , whose magnetic fields span a much larger range .",
    "therefore , if the decay of magnetic fields leads to the observed emission from axps , that no x - rays are seen from psr  j1814@xmath01744  argues that 1e  2259@xmath13586  is much younger , even though the characteristic ages indicate otherwise , consistent with the latter s association with snr ctb  109 .",
    "this suggests that 1e  2259@xmath13586   has had a spin - down history inconsistent with simple dipole braking or that it was born with a long spin period .",
    "heyl & hernquist ( 1997a ) have suggested a second model , based on photon cooling , for the production of x - rays in axps .",
    "they extend into the magnetar regime ( @xmath85 ) the work of shibanov & yakovlev ( 1996 ) , who have shown that when the magnetic field of a neutron star exceeds 10@xmath86  g , enhancements in the conductivity along the field lines due to electron energy quantization result in a net increase in heat flux ( heyl & hernquist 1997b ; @xcite ) . in sufficiently young stars ( ages of @xmath661  kyr )",
    "this leads to a gradual increase in photon luminosity with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the composition of the neutron star envelope has an even more dramatic effect ; the luminosity transmitted through a helium envelope is six times that transmitted through an iron envelope , while that transmitted through a hydrogen envelope is ten times that for iron .",
    "they then argue that the total mass of an insulating low - z layer required for the observed axp luminosity is modest and easily attained from either fall - back following the supernova explosion or accretion from the ism , if the pulsar has a large birth velocity or the density is high enough .",
    "heyl & hernquist ( 1997b ; 1998 ) consider how the flux varies across the surface of a magnetar and find a strong angular dependence caused by the anisotropic heat conduction in the outer layers of the neutron star .",
    "the temperature gradient , coupled with the limb darkening expected from magnetized atmospheres ( see heyl & hernquist 1997b and references therein ) , results in a modulation of the thermal flux .",
    "the observed pulsed fraction may be reduced by gravitational lensing , which makes more than half of the neutron star surface visible at a given instance ( see , e.g. page 1995 and heyl & hernquist 1998 ) and effectively smooths the flux gradient discussed above in @xmath473.1 .",
    "this model accounts for both the intensity of the x - ray emission and the pulsed fractions from 1e  1841@xmath0045 and 1e  2259@xmath13586 ( heyl & hernquist 1997a ) , assuming the pulsar ages are those of their associated supernova remnant , kes  73 and ctb  109 , respectively .",
    "the absence of x - rays from psr  j1814@xmath01744  again argues that this neutron star must be much older than 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "alternatively , psr  j1814@xmath01744  could be equally as young as 1e  2259@xmath13586 and may not possess a light - element insulating layer , in spite of the ease with which heyl & hernquist ( 1997a ) suggest them to be formed .",
    "in summary , we have set an upper limit on x - ray emission from the newly observed high magnetic field radio pulsar psr  j1814@xmath01744 .",
    "the upper limit on the flux implies a luminosity in x - rays well below those of any known axp .",
    "this conclusion is independent of any beaming given the low pulsed fraction of the known axps , and is robust to modest flux variability .",
    "this argues that any magnetar mechanism invoked to explain x - ray emission from axps must depend on more than observed @xmath15 and @xmath16 , hence on more than merely inferred b field . in the context of the two particular magnetar hypotheses discussed above",
    ", psr  j1814@xmath01744  must be considerably older than any of the known axps , including 1e  2259@xmath13586 , in spite of characteristic ages that indicate otherwise .",
    "this is consistent with 1e  2259@xmath13586  being a much younger object than its characteristic age suggests , in agreement with its association with ctb  109 .",
    "additionally , it implies that its spin - down history has deviated significantly from dipole braking , or that it had a large ( few seconds ) initial spin period .",
    "sgrs and axps may thus have markedly different evolutionary paths from radio pulsars , including even the extreme members of the latter population .",
    "thus , the proximity of sgrs and axps to any radio pulsar in @xmath87 phase space must be considered merely coincidental and caution must be used when comparing the different classes of neutron stars .",
