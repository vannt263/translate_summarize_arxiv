    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ understanding and controlling dynamics of many - body quantum systems when they are open to the environment and driven far from equilibrium is an exciting and important topic of current research in theoretical @xcite and experimental quantum physics @xcite . in particular , since it has been recently realized that certain emergent phenomena , such as quantum phase transitions and long range order  previously known only in equilibrium zero - temperature quantum states @xcite  can appear also in far from equilibrium steady states of quantum liouville evolution @xcite . in investigating dynamical and critical many - body phenomena , </S>",
    "<S> quasi - free ( quadratic ) quantum systems play an important role as they are amenable to analytical treatment ( see e.g. @xcite ) , so many effects can be analyzed exactly or in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> for example , quantum phase transitions in non - equilibrium steady states have been observed either in quasi - free @xcite , or strongly interacting @xcite , or even dissipative @xcite quantum systems in one dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> at least two distinct types of quantum phase transitions with emergence of long range order have been identified : ( i ) transitions which result from competition between unitary and dissipative parts of the liouvillian dynamics @xcite , and ( ii ) transitions which occur in boundary driven systems @xcite ( without any dissipation in the bulk ) as a result some qualitative change in the properties of the unitary dynamics ( i.e. of the hamiltonian ) , say spontaneous symmetry breaking or bifurcations in quasi - particle dispersion relation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it has not yet been investigated whether such a structure of long range order can persist in the presence of external , periodic driving . </S>",
    "<S> open and dissipative quantum system periodically driven by intense laser fields have been studied by means of the so called floquet theory @xcite , however most of the previous studies have dealt with essentially single - particle problems . from dynamical system </S>",
    "<S> s perspective , it can be argued , that periodically driven or kicked quantum chains are probably the simplest and cleanest examples of quantum many - body ergodic dynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , periodic time dependence offers new ways of encoding topological information ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> periodically driven many - body systems have thus been proposed as candidate systems for studying topological order and detecting majorana fermions in one dimension @xcite . on the other hand , quantum spin chains with particular specific hamiltonians </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed as efficient ways for quantum information transfer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> engineering hamiltonians and liouvillians with particular properties in terms of a small set of primitive local operations ( realized by laser pulses ) is one of the key problems in designing quantum computation , so it would be highly desirable to have simple and powerful techniques for theoretical treatment of time - dependent open many - body systems , not necessarily time - periodic .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we address the question of exact treatment of periodically driven quasi - free open many - body dynamics , which can be described either by time - dependent lindblad equation , or equivalently , by discrete dynamical semigroups . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the idea of canonical quantization in the fock space of density operators @xcite and solve for the covariance matrix of the ( asymptotic ) stationary floquet state in terms of the discrete lyapunov equation . </S>",
    "<S> this yields an efficient general setup applicable to such class of problems in the language of classical control theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method , which can be useful also in the case of non - periodic time - dependence , is then applied to treat an open heisenberg xy spin 1/2 chain which is periodically kicked with a transverse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we find an appearance of two distinct phases of spin - spin correlations by changing the ( bulk ) system s parameters , namely the phase of exponentially decaying correlations and the phase of long range magnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram of the model is rather complex , but can be reproduced in terms of bifurcations of the floquet quasi - energy quasi - particle dispersion relation .    _ </S>",
    "<S> stationary floquet state . </S>",
    "<S> _ we consider a finite system of @xmath0 ( majorana ) fermions , which are described by @xmath1 anticommuting hermitian operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which may be constructed in terms of pauli spin 1/2 operators @xmath5 via jordan - wigner transformation @xmath6 we shall be interested in a solution of a general time - dependent markovian master equation for the system s density operator @xmath7 , @xmath8 + \\hat{\\cal d}(t ) \\rho , \\label{eq : lindblad}\\ ] ] where the dissipator may either be of a lindblad form @xmath9 , given in terms of ( possibly time dependent ) lindblad operators @xmath10 , or even of more general , redfield form ( see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> recently , a general approach to explicit analysis of dynamical properties of markovian master equations of open many - body systems has been proposed @xcite , which is based on quantization in the fock space of ( density ) operators , sometimes referred to as the ` third quantization ' . in the context of quasi - free systems , </S>",

    "<S> , the general solution of ( [ eq : tdepc ] ) for covariances can be sought for in terms of an ansatz @xmath27 which results in two simpler equations , for @xmath17 real matrix functions @xmath28 @xmath29 with explicit solutions @xmath30    in this letter we are interested in a time - periodic markovian master equation ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) , with @xmath31 , and looking for the stationary state @xmath32 , satisfying @xmath33 which we will refer to as _ stationary floquet state _ ( sfs ) . </S>",

    "<S> for example , the eigenvalue @xmath39 of @xmath17 matrix @xmath38 of maximal modulus ( note that all eigenvalues of @xmath40 have modulus less than @xmath41 ) , is also a maximal modulus eigenvalue of @xmath42 matrix @xmath37 , and determines the time - scale @xmath43 of relaxation to sfs .    </S>",

    "<S> we apply our method to study the kicked xy heisenberg spin 1/2 chain @xmath52 coupled to a pair of lindblad baths at its ends , with four lindblad operators @xmath53 , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the model is quadratic in majorana fermions @xmath2  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the structure matrices can be written in @xmath55 block - matrix form as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 using standard linear algebra routines we have solved numerically the eq . </S>",

    "<S> however , in contrast with the time - independent case , we find here a very rich phase diagram ( see fig.[fig : figure1 ] ) with re - entrant lrmc phase .     </S>",
    "<S> ( plotted in a log - scale , @xmath64 , with coupling constants @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) in sfs of kicked heisenberg xy spin chain for anisotropy @xmath68 ( top left ) and @xmath69 ( top right ) . </S>",

    "<S> phase ceases to be a simply connected region . </S>",
    "<S> below we show some typical spin - spin correlation matrices chosen along the red line on @xmath68 phase diagram ( @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> leftmost panel clearly shows exponential fall - off from the diagonal , the middle two belong to lrmc phase near the phase boundary , and the rightmost to a kind of _ antiresonance _ which occurs for @xmath72 where the kick has no effect . ]     for kicked xy chain ( same parameters as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structure evidently coincides with the phase diagram of residual correlations @xmath73 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we find that qualitative properties of the phase diagram are completely independent of the bath parameters @xmath74 , so we expect that theoretical explanation rests only on the bulk properties . </S>",
    "<S> in analogy to the time - independent case , where the phases have been explained based on quasi - particle dispersion relation of the infinite xy chain  @xcite , we study dispersion relation for the floquet modes @xmath75 in the absence of the baths ( @xmath76 ) . due to translational invariance of the infinite chain </S>",
    "<S> , the floquet modes can be written in terms of the bloch waves @xmath77 , namely @xmath78 , where @xmath79\\exp[-\\tau({{\\mathbf{x}}}^0_{1,0}e^ { { { \\rm i } } \\kappa}+{{\\mathbf{x}}}^0_{0,1}e^{- { { \\rm i } } \\kappa})]\\ ] ] is a su(2 ) matrix , with two quasi - energy bands @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 is the quasi - particle energy for the un - kicked xy chain , @xmath82 . as it has been argued in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , lrmc phase is signaled by the appearance of a nontrivial stationary point @xmath83 in the quasi - particle dispersion relation , i.e. @xmath84 for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , near the phase boundary the nontrivial stationary points are emerging , say at @xmath86 , so the critical parameters can be obtained via landau scenario by expanding the quasi - energy @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the nontrivial solution @xmath88 exists when @xmath89 and @xmath90 have different signs , thus a new pair of stationary points emerges when @xmath91 , which defines the critical field @xmath92 by solving the equation @xmath93 . such curves @xmath94 exactly reproduce the rib structure of the phase diagrams in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1],[fig : figure2 ] and  where separating the regions between 0 and 2 nontrivial stationary points  define the phase boundary . furthermore , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] we observe that the phase diagram structure can be nicely reproduced by plotting the number @xmath95 of non - trivial stationary points @xmath83 of @xmath96 , the total number of stationary points being @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this has interesting consequences on the temporal growth of block entropy in the operator space @xcite which is conjectured as @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can define a critical exponent by approaching the phase boundary from the side where correlations decay exponentially @xmath99 , @xmath100 . using our heuristic quasi - particle picture , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath101 can be derived from the imaginary stationary point wave - number near the critical point @xmath102 , @xmath103 giving the critical exponent @xmath104 , which is confirmed by numerical simulations in kicked xy chain in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have carefully checked numerically another signature of non - equilibrium quantum phase transition , namely the closing of the spectral gap @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we find clearly  similarly as in time - independent open xy model  @xcite  that @xmath106 away from the phase boundary @xmath107 whereas @xmath108 for @xmath109 .    , and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> in non - lrmc phase correlations decay as @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm , for two values of @xmath113 that correlation length @xmath114 diverges with critical exponent @xmath104 when approaching the critical point . in the right panel </S>",
    "<S> we show an abrupt transition of the order parameter @xmath62 when entering the lrmc phase . in the inset , </S>",
