    "however , we can not claim that all of the absorption line systems with column densities between @xmath40 and @xmath3 cm@xmath1 ( the sub - dla column density definition ) satisfy the same trend , as already shown by the example of the sub - dla system at @xmath41 towards pss j2155 + 1358 .",

    "we have used the cloudy software package ( version 94.00 , ferland 1997 ) , and we have computed photoionization models assuming ionization equilibrium . in the models we have adopted a plane - parallel geometry for the gas cloud , the solar abundance pattern , and two different ionizing spectra , since the major uncertainty in determining the ionization effects in absorption line systems is the unknown shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the two most likely origins for ionizing uv photons are external background sources and internal stellar sources @xmath19 it is reasonable to expect some star formation in these systems . for the external ionizing source",

    "therefore , the more numerous the measurements of column density ratios of adjacent ions of different elements , the more accurate is the determination of the ionization state of a system , all the more since the reliability of the derived photoionization models depends not only on the assumed hypothesis , but also on the accuracy of the input atomic data for the cloudy code ( e.g. dielectric recombination coefficients ) .    following the prochaska et  al .",

    "the main advantage of these models compared to the models giving the predicted x@xmath51 column densities as a function of @xmath44 is that they allow a direct quantification of the effects of photoionization on the absolute and relative abundances .      in the sample of the 12 sub - dla systems and",

    "this large range of input parameters for the cloudy models allows us to highlight some general trends .",
    "indeed , the computed cloudy models specific to each sub - dla system in our sample show that for a given ionization parameter , @xmath44 , the derived [ x@xmath51/h@xmath24 ] and [ x@xmath51/fe@xmath25 ] ionization corrections ( as defined in section  [ methodology ] ) increase with lower column densities of systems for all low - ions x@xmath51 and for both the hm or ssp ionizing spectra , while no particular trend is observed with the metallicity of the systems .",

    "we plan to extend the current sample of sub - dla systems in order to increase the statistical weight of the obtained results both from the newly accessible data in the eso uves archives and from observations of pre - selected high - redshift quasars , since it is at high redshift @xmath70 that the sub - dlas are expected to contain a large fraction of the neutral hydrogen gas mass ( proux et  al .",
