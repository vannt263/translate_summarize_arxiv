    "the recent search for a putative quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) state in three - dimensional ( 3d ) pyrochlore lattice quantum spin ice ( qsi ) has led to a new proposal of quantum spin hamiltonian devoid of the debilitating quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) sign problem in a wide range of the parameter regime @xcite .",

    "@xcite , have studied the projected 3d qsi hamiltonian of huang , chen , and hermele @xcite onto a 2d frustrated kagom lattice with a [ 111 ] crystallographic field .",
    "they have explored this model by an explicit finite temperature qmc simulations and identified the interactions that promote a qsl state . in a recent study ,",
    "we have complemented the qmc analysis using linear spin wave theory @xcite . in that study",
    ", we found that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the quantum kagom ice model , hence the semiclassical analysis captures a broad trend of the quantum phase diagram and ground state properties uncovered by qmc @xcite .",
