    "<S> cross - jet transport of passive scalars in a kinematic model of the meandering laminar two - dimensional incompressible flow which is known to produce chaotic mixing is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a method for detecting barriers to cross - jet transport in the phase space which is a physical space for our model . using tools from theory of nontwist maps , </S>",
    "<S> we construct a central invariant curve and compute its characteristics that may serve good indicators of the existence of a central transport barrier , its strength , and topology . computing fractal dimension , length , and winding number of that curve in the parameter space </S>",
    "<S> , we study in detail change of its geometry and its destruction that are caused by local bifurcations and a global bifurcation known as reconnection of separatrices of resonances . </S>",
    "<S> scenarios of reconnection are different for odd and even resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the central invariant curves with rational and irrational ( noble ) values of winding numbers are arranged into hierarchical series which are described in terms of continued fractions . </S>",
    "<S> destruction of central transport barrier is illustrated for two ways in the parameter space : when moving along resonant bifurcation curves with rational values of the winding number and along curves with noble ( irrational ) values . </S>"
