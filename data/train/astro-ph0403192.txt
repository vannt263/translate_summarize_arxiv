    "recent submillimetre ( submm ) surveys show that the majority of the submm background at wavelengths of @xmath7 m arises from a population of distant , highly luminous infrared galaxies with 850@xmath0 m flux densities of @xmath8mjy ( blain et al .  1999 ;",

    "the steep slope of the submm counts indicates that the integrated background is dominated by @xmath9mjy galaxies , below the @xmath10mjy confusion limit of the deepest blank - field 850@xmath0 m surveys carried out to date ( hughes et al.1998 ) , and well below the 38mjy flux density limits ( 34@xmath11 ) typically achieved in wider - field 850@xmath0 m surveys ( e.g.  eales et al .",

    "submm galaxies in the 1-mjy regime can , however , only be studied at present by exploiting a natural telescope  a massive gravitational lens formed by a rich clusters of galaxies  which provide the opportunity of overcoming both the confusion limit ( by spatially magnifying an area of the sky behind the lens ) and the sensitivity limit ( by gravitational magnification of the sources within this area ) .",

    "unfortunately , the intrinsically faintest sources are usually only detected at modest significance , complicating the identification and analysis of their counterparts in other wavebands .    to investigate the properties of the mjy - population in detail we require a high - signal - to - noise detection of a sub - mjy submm galaxy .",
    "such systems can arise in rare configurations where the source is located within a small region on the background sky defined by the caustic of the lens , which then forms multiple , highly magnified images of the background galaxy ( see also borys et al .",
    "this situation not only provides a tool for investigating the properties of intrinsically faint galaxies in detail , but also provides a unique opportunity to measure the redshift of the background galaxy from the geometry of the images combined with an accurate model of the cluster lens , using a ray - tracing technique to triangulate the three - dimensional position of the galaxy in the volume behind the lens .",
    "this technique , which was demonstrated successfully by kneib et al.(1996 ) and confirmed by ebbels et al .",

    "the colours of the three counterparts are similar , although crowding in the various fields and the effects of differential amplification on our fixed - aperture photometry may explain the lack of precise agreement ( the colours of smm - a should give the best indication of the true spectral energy distribution of the galaxy as it is not contaminated by any foreground galaxy ) .",
    "nevertheless , all three counterparts show a similar pattern of a pronounced red core surround by two blue regions , for example in smm - b the centre of the galaxy ( @xmath38 ) is much brighter in @xmath28 than in @xmath39 , while the southern ( and northern ) extremities , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are considerably brighter in @xmath39 ( figure  [ fig.truecol ] ) .",
    "a similar pattern of a red centre bracketed by bluer regions is seen in smm - a and c. we illustrate that this effect is not a result of the different spatial resolutions of the @xmath28 and @xmath39 frames by contouring the seeing - matched @xmath39 over the @xmath28-band frame in figure  [ fig.truecol ] .    the photometric similarity of the three southern submm sources , combined with the fact that their counterparts exhibit strong spectral and morphological similarities , suggests that we are seeing three images of a single luminous submm galaxy ( which we will call smmj16359 + 6612 in the following ) , lying behind the cluster .",

    "these observations also yielded a redshift for # 468 of @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , a 9.2-ks exposure using the 400/3400 blue grism on a second mask targeting galaxies in this field yielded a redshift for another @xmath51 galaxy . this galaxy is identified as # 273 ( le borgne et al .",

    "the fact that we do not see such structure in the smm - a image is due to the fact that only component @xmath40 ( and probably part of @xmath38 ) was in the nirspec slit .",

    "<S> we present observations of a remarkable submillimetre - selected galaxy , smmj16359 + 6612 . </S>",
    "<S> this distant galaxy lies behind the core of a massive cluster of galaxies , a2218 , and is gravitationally lensed by the foreground cluster into three discrete images which were identified in deep submillimetre maps of the cluster core at both 450 and 850@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent follow - up using deep optical and near - infrared images identify a faint counterpart to each of the three images , with similar red optical  near - infrared colours and _ hst _ morphologies . by exploiting a detailed mass model for the cluster lens </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the combined images of this galaxy are magnified by a factor of @xmath145 , implying that this galaxy would have un - lensed magnitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and an un - lensed 850-@xmath0um flux density of only 0.8mjy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the highly constrained lens model predicted the redshift of smmj16359 + 6612 to be @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this estimate using deep optical and near - infrared keck spectroscopy , measuring a redshift of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> smmj16359 + 6612 is the faintest submm - selected galaxy so far identified with a precise redshift . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the large gravitational magnification of this source , we identify three sub - components in this submm galaxy , which are also seen in the nirspec data , arguing for either a strong dust ( lane ) absorption or a merger . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there are two other highly - amplified galaxies at almost identical redshifts in this field ( although neither is a strong submm emitter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the three galaxies lie within a @xmath6kpc region on the background sky , suggesting this submm galaxy is located in a dense high - redshift group .    </S>",
