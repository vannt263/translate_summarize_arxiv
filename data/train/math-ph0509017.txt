    "it is considered common knowledge that , for spin systems , the behavior of a quantum model at finite temperature is `` like '' the behavior of the corresponding classical model . however , beyond the level of heuristics , it is far from clear in what sense the above statement is meaningful .",
    "another , slightly more academic way to `` recover '' the classical spin system is to consider spin - representations with spin - magnitude  @xmath1 and then let  @xmath6 .",
    "a standard argument as to why this should work is that the commutators between various spin operators are order-@xmath7 smaller than the quantities themselves , and so the spins behave essentially classically when  @xmath1 is large .",
    "notwithstanding , precise statements along these lines have only been made for the @xmath6 limit of the free energies  @xcite and specific types of  @xmath7 corrections  @xcite .",
    "a common shortcoming of the above studies is that neither spells explicit conditions on the relative magnitude of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 for which the classical behavior is exhibited .",
    "this is of importance because , at sufficiently low temperatures , the relevant excitations are _",
    "quantum_. for example , while the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on a finite bipartite graph has a continuum of ground states ( related by the so(3 ) symmetry ) , the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet has a unique ground state  @xcite .",
    "another example is the 111-interface in the classical ising model which , at zero temperature , is disordered but may be stabilized by appropriate ( but arbitrarily small ) quantum perturbations  @xcite . the control of the relevant quantum excitations is a non - trivial subject and is usually accomplished only when finite - temperature effects are of little significance for the overall  behavior .",
    "the preceding discussion is particularly important for systems which undergo phase transitions . here",
    "several techniques have been available ",
    "infrared bounds @xcite , chessboard estimates @xcite and contour expansions  @xcite  some of which ( specifically , the latter two ) are more or less based on the assumption that the quantum system of interest has a strong classical component .",
    "however , while certain conclusions happen to apply uniformly well even as  @xmath6 , the classical reference state of these techniques is usually _ discrete _ ( e.g. , ising type ) .",
    "this is quite unlike the  @xmath6 limit which inherently leads to a _ continuous - spin _ , heisenberg - like model .",
    "thus , the relation between the above `` near - classical '' techniques and the @xmath6 results discussed in the first paragraph is tenuous .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a direct connection between the @xmath6 approach to the classical limit of quantum spin systems and the proofs of phase transitions by the traditional means of chessboard estimates .",
    "explicitly , we establish the following general fact : _ whenever chessboard estimates can be used to prove a phase transition in the classical system , a corresponding transition will occur in the quantum system provided  @xmath8 is sufficiently larger than the inverse temperature_. this permits us to prove phase transitions in systems with highly degenerate ground states , but without continuous symmetry , as well as certain temperature driven phase transitions which have not been accessible heretofore .    to highlight the main idea of our approach ,",
    "let us recall how chessboard estimates enter the proofs of phase transitions .",
    "suppose a quantum system on the torus is partitioned into disjoint blocks and a projector on a `` bad event '' is applied in some of the blocks .",
    "the goal is to show that the expectation  in the quantum gibbs state  of the product of these projectors decays exponentially with the number of bad blocks . here",
    "the chessboard estimates offer a non - trivial simplification : the expectation to the inverse number of bad blocks is maximized by the configuration in which all blocks are bad . in classical models , the latter quantity  sometimes referred to as the _",
    "universal contour_is often fairly easy to estimate by properly accounting for energy and entropy of the allowed configurations .",
    "however , this is not the case once quantum effects get into play ; the only general technique that has been developed for this purpose is the `` principle of exponential localization ''  @xcite which hinges on an approximate diagonalization of the `` universal projectors '' and model - specific spectral estimates .",
    "the main feature of our approach is that we bound the ( relevant ) universal contours directly  namely , by the universal contours for the _ classical _",
    "( i.e. ,  @xmath9 ) version of the quantum system .",
    "the technical estimate making this possible is a new bound on the matrix element of the gibbs - boltzmann weight relative to _ coherent states _",
    "@xmath10 , which is close in the spirit to the celebrated berezin - lieb inequalities  @xcite .",
    "the result is that @xmath11 is dominated by the classical gibbs - boltzmann weight times a correction that is exponential in  @xmath12volume .",
    "hence , if @xmath2 , the exponential growth - rate of partition functions , even those constrained by various projectors , is close to that of the classical system .",
    "this is ideally suited for an application of chessboard estimates and the corresponding technology  developed in  @xcite  for proving first - order phase transitions .",
    "unfortunately , the bound in terms of universal contour has to be performed before the `` conversion '' to the classical setting and so we still require that the quantum system is reflection positive .    to showcase our approach , we provide proofs of phase transitions in the following five quantum systems ( defined by their respective formal hamiltonians ) :    1 .",
