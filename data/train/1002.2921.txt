    "<S> a nanometer - size superconducting quantum interference device ( nanosquid ) is fabricated on the apex of a sharp quartz tip and integrated into a scanning squid microscope . a simple self - aligned fabrication method results in nanosquids with diameters down to 100 nm with no lithographic processing . an aluminum nanosquid with an effective area of 0.034 @xmath0 displays flux sensitivity of @xmath1 and operates in fields as high as 0.6 t. with projected spin sensitivity of 65 @xmath2 and high bandwidth </S>",
    "<S> , the squid on a tip is a highly promising probe for nanoscale magnetic imaging and spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> imaging magnetic fields on a nanoscale is a major challenge in nanotechnology , physics , chemistry , and biology . </S>",
    "<S> one of the milestones in this endeavor will be the achievement of sensitivity sufficient for detection of the magnetic moment of a single electron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are three main technological challenges : fabrication of a sensor with a high magnetic flux sensitivity , reduction of the size of the sensor , and the ability to scan the sensor nanometers above the sample . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) have the highest magnetic field sensitivity , but their loop diameter is usually many microns . </S>",
    "<S> much effort has been devoted recently to the development of nanosquids , which have shown very promising flux sensitivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these devices , however , are based on planar technology using lithographic or focused ion beam ( fib ) patterning methods @xcite ; the large in - plane size of the devices precludes bringing the squid loop into sufficiently close proximity to the sample ( due to alignment issues ) to scan it with optimal sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a terraced squid susceptometer was developed that is based on a multilayered lithographic process combined with fib etching . </S>",
    "<S> this device includes a 600 nm pickup loop which can be scanned 300 nm above the sample surface @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple method for the self - aligned fabrication of a dc nanosquid on a tip with effective diameter as small as 100 nm that can be scanned just a few nm above the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> we have fabricated several squid - on - tip ( sot ) devices of various sizes . </S>",
    "<S> a quartz tube of 1 mm outside diameter is pulled to a sharp tip with apex diameter that can be controllably varied between 100 and 400 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication of the sot consists of three `` self - aligned '' steps of thermal evaporation of al , as shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a . in the first step , </S>",
    "<S> 25 nm of al are deposited on the tip tilted at an angle of -100@xmath3 with respect to the line to the source . </S>",
    "<S> then the tip is rotated to an angle of 100@xmath3 , followed by a second deposition of 25 nm . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> two leads on opposite sides of the quartz tube are formed , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b . in the last step 17 nm of al </S>",
    "<S> are evaporated at an angle of 0@xmath3 , coating the apex ring of the tip . </S>",
    "<S> the two areas where the leads contact the ring form `` strong '' superconducting regions , whereas the two parts of the ring in the gap between the leads , indicated by arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c , constitute two weak links , thus forming the squid . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nanosquid requires no lithographic processing , its size is controlled by a conventional pulling procedure of a quartz tube , and it is located at the apex of a sharp tip that is ideal for scanning probe microscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> the studies were carried out at 300 mk , well below the critical temperature @xmath4 k of granular thin films of aluminum in our deposition system . instead of the commonly used current bias , the sot was operated in a voltage bias mode , as shown schematically in the inset to fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a low bias resistance @xmath5 of about 2 @xmath6 and the sot current , @xmath7 , is measured using a squid series array amplifier ( ssaa ) working in a feedback mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is a parasitic series resistance .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath9 characteristics display several interesting features , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . first </S>",
    "<S> , the advantage of our sot and the voltage bias setup is that there is no hysteresis , which avoids the need for complicated pulsed measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we observe a large negative differential resistance over a wide range of biases . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with the aslamazov - larkin model of a single josephson junction @xcite if the voltage bias circuit of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> third , small squids often have a small modulation of the critical current with field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our sot , in contrast , shows very pronounced @xmath10 modulation as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . finally , the @xmath9 characteristics show fine structure at high biases , e.g. , the 25 mt curve in fig .  2 , which apparently results from resonances , the exact nature of which requires further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows @xmath11 plots displaying very pronounced quantum interference patterns with a period of 60.8 mt , corresponding to an effective squid diameter of 208 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of the critical current is large , @xmath12 , and in addition a large asymmetry between negative and positive biases is observed . due to this asymmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the interference patterns at negative and positive bias are almost out of phase . from a theoretical fit @xcite to @xmath10 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a by the dashed curves , we extract the following parameters : the critical currents of the two junctions @xmath13 0.8 @xmath14a and @xmath15 2.4 @xmath14a , where @xmath16 @xmath14a , the asymmetry parameter @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the loop inductance and @xmath20 is the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric interference patterns therefore arise from the difference in the critical currents of the two junctions . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is in fact very advantageous for scanning probe applications since high sensitivity can be attained essentially at any field by an appropriate choice of the sot bias polarity and voltage .    </S>",
    "<S> the almost optimal @xmath21 of the sot implies a large inductance @xmath22 ph . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated geometrical inductance of our loop is @xmath23 ph , which is more than three orders of magnitude smaller . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath24 nm is the loop radius and @xmath25 nm is the radius of the loop wire . </S>",
    "<S> our device is therefore governed by the kinetic inductance @xcite of the loop , @xmath26 , due to its small dimensions . here </S>",
    "<S> nm@xmath28 is the estimated cross sectional area of the loop , resulting in penetration depth @xmath29 0.58 @xmath14 m . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath30 is much larger than the bulk value for al but is quite plausible for very thin granular al films @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> usually squids are operational only at very low fields . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the sot can operate over a very wide range of fields without a significant reduction in sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3b and 3c show substantial quantum oscillations at fields as high as 0.5 t , which provides a unique advantage for investigation of various systems . </S>",
    "<S> this special property of sot apparently arises from the fact that all the device dimensions are very small and the thin superconducting leads along the quartz tube are aligned parallel to the applied field .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the spectral density of the flux noise of the sot at various applied fields . above a few tens of hz the low frequency 1/f -like noise changes into white noise on the level of @xmath31 to @xmath1 over a wide range of fields , which translates into a field sensitivity of @xmath32 t. </S>",
    "<S> our flux sensitivity is comparable to that of state of the art squids @xcite , yet the area of the sot loop is only 0.034 @xmath0 , which is the smallest reported to date @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small size of sot is highly advantageous for spin detection since spin sensitivity in units of @xmath2 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of the loop , @xmath35 is the height of the loop above the spin dipole , @xmath36 m , and @xmath37 is the flux sensitivity in @xmath38 @xcite . for @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain spin sensitivity of 65 @xmath2 for spins located in the center of the loop with an on - axis magnetic moment . in the sot geometry </S>",
    "<S> , however , enhanced sensitivity could be achieved by imaging the spins near the perimeter of the loop @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity is mainly determined by the width of the weak link of about 30 nm rather than the diameter of the loop of 208 nm , leading to an estimated sensitivity of about 33 @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> such sensitivity should allow imaging of the spin state of a single molecule @xcite , for example @xmath41-acetate ( @xmath42 ) , with integration of a few seconds . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our smallest operating sot has an effective diameter of 130 nm . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that it has the same flux noise as the larger sot , the estimated spin sensitivity could be increased to below 20 @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have integrated the sot into a scanning probe microscope operating at 300 mk in which the tip is glued to one tine of a quartz tuning fork . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency shift or the reduction in amplitude of the resonance peak of the tuning fork are used as a feedback mechanism for tip proximity to the sample surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method provides the possibility of simultaneous imaging of sample topography and of the local magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the tip oscillation is typically less than 1 nm , and hence does not degrade the spatial resolution of the magnetic imaging . as a test sample we used a 200 nm thick film of al patterned into a serpentine structure . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5c shows a topographical scan across two adjacent strips of the seprpentine using the tip and the tuning fork . </S>",
    "<S> a transport current of 2 ma at 510 hz was applied to the sample and the self - induced magnetic field was measured by the sot at various heights above the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5a . the data are in good agreement with the theoretically calculated field profiles shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b . a field as low as 1 @xmath14 t is readily measurable , which allows detection of the seprpentine signal from a distance of 10 @xmath14 m above the surface .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed a simple method for fabrication of sensitive nanosquids on the apices of sharp tips and have incorporated them into a scanning squid microscope . </S>",
    "<S> a nanosquid with effective area of 0.034 @xmath0 operated at fields as high as 0.6 t and displayed flux sensitivity of @xmath1 , which translates into on - axis spin sensitivity of 65 @xmath2 . by optimizing the sot parameters , a further reduction in the noise can be expected , which , combined with a smaller loop diameter , could lead to a significant improvement in spin sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> compared to other squid technologies , the ability to image magnetic fields just a few nm above the sample surface renders the squid on tip a highly promising tool for study of quantum magnetic phenomena on a nanoscale .    </S>",
