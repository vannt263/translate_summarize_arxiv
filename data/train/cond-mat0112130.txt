    "one of the main achievements of statistical physics during the past decades is the understanding of the universal properties of systems near an equilibrium second order phase transition .",
    "universality classes , characterized by a small number of parameters allow us to understand why different systems have the same critical properties  @xcite .",
    "one important model in equilibrium statistical physics is the so - called q - states potts model  @xcite , which can be used to describe a large class of physical systems .",
    "its rich critical behaviour is to a large extent understood .",
    "it is known that the important parameters which determine its critical behaviour are its dimensionality @xmath5 and the degeneracy of its ground state @xmath0 .",
    "the relatively complete understanding of equilibrium phase transitions has yet no nonequilibrium counterpart .",
    "however , it is becoming evident that some analogies between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems could be made .",
    "for example , a classification into universality classes is particularly evident for one - dimensional nonequilibrium models with absorbing states  @xcite , which exhibit a phase transition between active and absorbing phase in their stationary state .",
    "a prime example of a universality class is the directed percolation one , which is typical to models with a single absorbing state  @xcite . the so - called parity - conserving ( pc ) universality class is typical for models with certain conservation laws or symmetries  @xcite .",
    "however , it is necessary to investigate nonequilibrium models in higher dimension to have a complete characterization of the possible universal properties .    analytical approach to high dimensional problems is based mainly on field - theory methods . recently , interesting results were obtained along this line by cardy and tuber  @xcite who clarified the role of parity conservation and also discovered some new universality classes .",
    "however , this technique is applicable only to certain particle systems  @xcite and a large class of two- and higher - dimensional models with absorbing states can not be treated within such a method .",
    "accordingly , our understanding of higher dimensional nonequilibrium models is rather limited . as for continuous phase transitions",
    "some models with single absorbing state were shown to fall into the dp universality class  @xcite .",
    "results were also reported for a two - dimensional model with two absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "these models are often motivated by problems of surface catalysis  @xcite .",
    "in some models with absorbing states discontinuous phase transitions are also known to occur  @xcite .",
    "a subclass of models with absorbing states are the so - called branching annihilating random walk ( barw ) ones . in barw models",
    "each particle can react ( annihilate , branch , diffuse , etc . ) according to prescribed rules .",
    "it turns out that barw models for @xmath6 are much different from the above mentioned ( surface - catalysis ) models .",
    "some of the results obtained from field - theory method  @xcite have been confirmed using numerical methods .",
    "for example szab and santos confirmed the existence of logarithmic corrections in two - dimensional parity - conserving barw models  @xcite .",
    "however , for parity non - conserving particle systems monte carlo simulations  @xcite seem to be in disagreement with field - theory results  @xcite .",
    "a characterization of the rich critical behaviour encountered in models with absorbing states is clearly an important issue .",
    "however , lacking a sound theoretical basis , it is by no means obvious which parameters are relevant for such a classification . on general grounds",
    "one expects that the dimensionality @xmath5 of the system is a relevant parameter .",
    "moreover , based on the information coming from the one- dimensional case and from equilibrium one expects that the number of absorbing states @xmath0 is another relevant parameter .",
    "note however that , in some cases , details of the dynamics might also change the critical properties , even without affecting the symmetricity of absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can expect that these cases are accidental rather than generic ( as it is the case in equilibrium phase transitions when a marginal scaling field is present  @xcite ) .",
    "keeping in mind the above objections , and lacking a better candidate , we consider @xmath0 as a classification parameter  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study a recently introduced nonequilibrium potts model with @xmath0 absorbing states .",
    "our numerical results for @xmath7 can be summarized as follows : ( i ) for @xmath8 and @xmath1 the models has a discontinuous transition .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath9 and @xmath2 the model exhibits a continuous , transition with an order parameter critical exponent @xmath3 ( mean - field ) .",
    "( iii ) simulations are inconclusive , however , in the @xmath8 and @xmath2 case , and we suggest that in this case the model is close to or at the crossing point of lines separating three different types of phase transitions .",
    "our results together with the already accumulated knowledge , prompted us to partition the ( @xmath10 ) plane into three regions of different phase transitions : mean - field , non - mean - field , and discontinuous .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the topology of such a partition is the same as for the equilibrium potts model .",
    "although nonequilibrium systems , and in particular models with absorbing states , are usually regarded as very much different from equilibrium systems our work shows , however , that despite some differences there are also some qualitative similarities .",
    "in addition , we performed simulations of a @xmath8 barw model without parity conservation .",
    "our results confirm the field - theory predictions according to which the critical behavior belongs to to the directed percolation universality class .",
    "before presenting our model let us recall basic properties of the equilibrium potts model . first we assign with a lattice site @xmath11 a @xmath0-state variable @xmath12",
    "next , we define the energy of this model through the hamiltonian : @xmath13 where summation is over pairs @xmath14 which are usually nearest neighbours and @xmath15 is the kronecker delta function . this equilibrium statistical mechanics model was studied using many different analytical and numerical methods and is a rich source of the information about phase transitions and critical phenomena  @xcite .    to study the equilibrium potts model using monte carlo simulations one constructs a stochastic markov process with suitably chosen transition rates .",
    "one of the possible choices corresponds to the so - called metropolis algorithm . in this algorithm one",
    "looks at the energy difference @xmath16 between the final and initial configuration and accept the move with probability min@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is temperature .",
    "a nonequilibrium potts model having @xmath0 adsorbing states can be obtained by making the following transformation in the metropolis dynamics  @xcite : when all neighbours of a given site are in the same state as this site , then this site can not change its state ( at least until one of its neighbours is changed ) .",
    "let us notice that any of @xmath0 ground states of the equilibrium potts model ( [ e1 ] ) is an absorbing state of our nonequilibrium potts model .",
    "the one - dimensional version of this nonequilibrium potts model has already been examined  @xcite .",
    "in addition to recovering the expected critical behaviour for @xmath2 and 3 it was found that certain additional modification of its dynamics might affect the critical behaviour .",
    "we shall not be concerned with such a variant in the present paper .",
    "since the dynamics of our models is obtained from a modification of the metropolis algorithm of an equilibrium system , transition probabilities are parametrized by temperature - like quantity @xmath18 . strictly speaking , for our model",
    "the ordinary temperature can not be defined .",
    "nevertheless , we will refer to this quantity as temperature .",
    "of course in the realm of nonequilibrium systems there are also other models than those with absorbing states .",
    "one of the important questions is whether under certain conditions nonequilibrium systems might be mapped , at least at the coarse - grained level , into equilibrium ones .",
    "some aspects of this problem were studied by grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite . in a class of models studied by them",
    "it is important that all transition probabilities are strictly greater than zero . in models with absorbing states",
    "this requirement is clearly violated .",
    "to study the properties of our model we made extensive monte - carlo simulations",
    ". a natural characteristic of models with absorbing states is the steady - state density of active sites @xmath19 .",
    "a given site @xmath11 is active when at least one of its neighbours is in a state different than @xmath11 .",
    "otherwise the site @xmath11 is called nonactive . upon approaching a critical point",
    "@xmath19 develops a power - law singularity characterized by the exponent @xmath20 . at the first - order transition",
    "@xmath19 has a jump .",
    "in addition , we also looked at its time dependence @xmath21 . in the active phase @xmath21",
    "converges to the positive value , while at criticality @xmath21 usually has a power - law decay @xmath22 . in the absorbing phase @xmath19",
    "very often decays faster than the power law , however , in some cases ( also those studied in the present paper ) a power law behaviour is seen , but with a different exponent than for the critical decay .",
    "moreover , we used the so - called dynamic monte carlo method where one sets the system in the absorbing state with activity only locally initiated and monitor some stochastic properties of runs  @xcite .",
    "one of the most frequently used characteristics is the survival probability @xmath23 that activity survives at least until time @xmath24 and the average number of active sites @xmath25 ( to calculate @xmath25 we average over all runs ) . at criticality @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath25 are expected to have power - law decay : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( for some models @xmath28 , but exceptions from this relation are also known  @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations were made for various system sizes and we ensured that the system was large enough so that presented below results are size independent .",
    "simulations for @xmath8 models were performed on the square lattice .",
    "the temperature dependence of the density of active sites @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "for @xmath30 it is virtually impossible to reach an active steady state value of @xmath19 , which suggests that the model undergoes a discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "such a scenario is confirmed by the data in figs .",
    "[ t3]-[dyn3a ] . in fig .",
    "[ t3 ] one can see that upon approaching the transition point @xmath21 develops a longer and longer plateau . at the transition point , which we locate around @xmath31 the density @xmath21 has basically an infinitely - long plateau .",
    "such a behaviour is a clear indication of the discontinuous nature of the transition .",
    "let us notice that below the transition temperature @xmath21 decays as @xmath32 .",
    "a simple scaling argument can be used to show that such a behaviour is related with the average domain size growth @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , let us consider the @xmath8 system of the linear size @xmath34 .",
    "it contains @xmath35 subdomains of the linear size @xmath36 and thus the total perimeter of these subdomains scales as @xmath37 . since",
    "active sites are located mainly at the domain walls their density scales as @xmath38 .",
    "assuming now that @xmath36 increases as @xmath39 we obtain that @xmath40 . the characteristic length which increases as @xmath39 is typical for coarsening in the broken - symmetry phase of the original potts model  @xcite .",
    "it also appears in the evolution of one - dimensional nonequilibrium systems which belong to the parity - conserving universality class .",
    "results of the dynamic monte carlo also support the discontinuous nature of the transition . indeed , both for @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ dyn3 ] ) and @xmath25 ( fig .  [ dyn3a ] )",
    "the data are systematically bending and no clear power - law behaviour is observed .",
    "thus , as a summary , for the @xmath41 case our model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition .      in the @xmath2 case the density of active sites is a similar function of temperature as in the @xmath1 case ( fig .",
    "let us notice however , that now the jump in @xmath19 is almost twice smaller than previously",
    ". we should be also aware of the fact that an observed jump might be a finite - size effect .",
    "( large fluctuations might drive the system into an absorbing state even though temperature is above the critical temperature ) . as further results show , it is rather difficult to clarify the nature of the transition in this case . first , let us notice that time dependence of @xmath21 does not develop a clear plateau as in the @xmath1 case .",
    "( we estimate the critical point in this case as @xmath43 ) .",
    "but neither there is a pronounced power - law behaviour seen in fig .",
    "if @xmath21 does decay as @xmath44 at criticality then @xmath45 is very small ( @xmath46 ) , which suggests that the true exponent @xmath45 might be equal to zero . sometimes to improve the estimation of @xmath15 one",
    "can use the so - called local slopes method  @xcite . in this method @xmath15",
    "is calculated from the equation @xmath47}{{\\rm log}_{10}(m ) } , \\label{localslopes}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a certain constant .",
    "application of this method to our data and @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ flocal ] . at criticality",
    "the data converge ( with some scattering ) to the value 0.06 but such a small value means that the possibility @xmath50 still can not be excluded .    in our opinion , from the steady - state and time - dependent measurements of @xmath19 the most likely possibility is that the transition is of first order and the plateau will develop ( in fig .  [ t2 ] ) but only at a larger time scale .    however , the dynamic monte carlo results shed some doubts on such an interpretation . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ dyn2 ] we can see that @xmath23 has a clear power - law decay for at least three decades in time with the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 seems to remain constant at the transition point which suggest that @xmath52 . to support our dynamic monte carlo results",
    "let us notice that hinrichsen reported basically the same values for dynamical exponents for another two - dimensional model with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the fact @xmath45 is close to unity and @xmath52 prompted him to suggest that the model exhibit a mean field behaviour .",
    "in such a case , however , one should have @xmath53 , which is clearly in contradiction with the behaviour of @xmath21 which we observe .",
    "a power - law behaviour of @xmath23 and @xmath25 is typical for continuous transitions which seems to be in conflict with the behaviour of @xmath19 .",
    "however , the possibility that we have a discontinuous transition accompanied by some dynamical power - law characteristics , although exotic at first sight , can not be ruled out . we will return to this problem in the next section .",
    "let us also notice ( fig .",
    "[ t2 ] ) that , similarly to the @xmath1 case , for @xmath54 the density @xmath21 seems to decay in time as @xmath32 .      as a last case in this section ,",
    "we consider our model on the simple cubic lattice and for @xmath2 .",
    "of course , simulations for three - dimensional systems are very demanding .",
    "therefore we were not able to perform detailed time - dependent simulations nor the dynamic monte carlo .",
    "however , the steady - state density @xmath19 as measured for @xmath56 and 60 is basically size independent ( fig .",
    "[ ro_cubic ] ) .",
    "nearly linear behaviour of @xmath19 in the vicinity of the transition suggests that in this case @xmath3 , which indicate a mean - field nature of the transition .",
    "in this section we sketch the overall behaviour of our model in the @xmath4 plane . our proposal ( fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) is based on the already accumulated knowledge , presented above results , and a minimalistic assumption that the resulting phase diagram should not be too complicated . essentially , we suggest that the @xmath4 plane can be divided into three regions of different types of phase transitions : ( i ) non - mean - field , ( ii ) mean - field , and ( iii ) first - order .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "as it is defined only through dynamical rules , our model is trivial for @xmath57 .",
    "however , the @xmath57 case corresponds to models with a single absorbing state ( directed percolation , contact process ) it is known that the critical dimension @xmath58 in this case equals 4 and for @xmath5 smaller / larger than @xmath58 we have a continuous non - mean - field / mean - field transition .",
    "firmly established are also results along the @xmath59 line .",
    "it is known that @xmath2 case corresponds typically to the pc universality class . for @xmath60",
    "one expects  @xcite that the model typically belongs to the same universality class as a @xmath61-barw model studied by tuber and cardy  @xcite , although , under more restrictive dynamics the pc criticality might also appear  @xcite . in any case , the critical behaviour is non - mean - field .",
    "taking into account the mean - field behavior obtained in the case @xmath62 , we assume that this case falls into the same region as dp above critical dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the discontinuous transition in the @xmath63 case implies the existence of the third region .",
    "actually we performed some simulations also for @xmath64 case .",
    "basically the behaviour is similar to the @xmath1 case except that the jump is larger and the first - order character of the transition is even more transparent .",
    "we expect that such a behaviour persists for all @xmath65 .",
    "provided that for @xmath66 there are no qualitative changes , the diagram must have a structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "it is thus clear that our most difficult case @xmath67 is located somewhere close to the point where all three regions meet .",
    "we have no strong arguments to locate this point exactly at the crossing point , but such a location would certainly explain unusual behaviour as seen in our monte carlo simulations .",
    "we do not exclude , however , the possibility that @xmath67 case is off the crossing point but somewhere close to it , which would still explain the numerical difficulties in this case .",
    "the resulting diagram looks very similar to the diagram of the equilibrium potts model  @xcite . in the equilibrium model",
    "the non - mean - field part is basically shifted by two upwards ( critical dimensions for ordinary percolation and the ising model are 6 and 4 , respectively ) .",
    "however , the diagram for the equilibrium potts model is much more meaningful than in our case .",
    "indeed , in the fortuin - kasteleyn representation , the potts model is well defined for any , even non - integer @xmath0 , which justifies continuous lines on its phase diagram . in our case",
    ", we do not have a representation of our model with continuous @xmath0 .",
    "the key property that would be required for such a representation is the existence of an analog of the partition function .",
    "such a quantity exists for nonequilibrium systems only in very special cases  @xcite . provided that a certain partition function exists for our model ( no matter how complicated ) , and that using this function one can find a corresponding fortuin - kasteleyn representation ( no matter how complicated ) , continuous lines in our diagram would be meaningful .",
    "of course , the presented diagram does not encompass all models with absorbing states .",
    "it is well known that for example there are @xmath68 models with first - order transitions  @xcite .",
    "but as we already mentioned , similar situation occurs for equilibrium systems where certain factors ( anisotropies , additional interactions etc . ) might change more generic behaviour .",
    "the presented diagram is valid only for the presented potts model and its applicability to other systems requires additional examination .",
    "in the present section we examine the two - dimensional barw model without parity conservation . in this model particles",
    "are located on sites of a square lattice .",
    "in addition to diffusion , which takes place at the rate @xmath69 , particles can branch , at the rate @xmath70 , according to the following reaction : @xmath71 where the offspring particle is placed on the randomly chosen nearest neighbour of a parent particle . moreover",
    ", two particles which happen to be placed at the same site annihilate instantaneously @xmath72 this model was already examined by takayasu and tretyakov  @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the model undergoes a continuous transition around @xmath73 and the density of particles decays linearly at the transition point ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result contradicts more recent field - theory approach which suggests that in this case the model should belong to the dp universality class  @xcite .",
    "since such a disagreement requires an explanation , we performed monte carlo simulations of this model .",
    "our system size was much larger than in takayasu and tretyakov simulations and we approached much closer to the critical point .",
    "one can see ( fig .",
    "[ ro_barw ] ) that although around @xmath74 ( which was the largest value of @xmath69 simulated by takayasu and tretyakov ) the density seems to decay linearly it has a pronounced bending close to the transition point . to obtain more accurate estimation of the critical point",
    "we examined the time dependence of @xmath21 ( see fig .  [ time ] ) . from these analysis",
    "we obtain the following estimation of the critical point @xmath75 .",
    "one can also see that at criticality @xmath21 has a power - law decay with the exponent close to the dp value @xmath76 .    having the critical point we can estimate exponent @xmath20 and the corresponding data are shown in fig .",
    "[ ro_barw_log ] .",
    "the least - square fit gives @xmath77 which is certainly compatible with the dp value 0.584(4 ) .    to summarize this section , our results confirm the field - theory prediction that barw models without parity conservation belong to the dp universality class",
    "in the present paper we examined @xmath5-dimensional nonequilibrium models with @xmath0 absorbing states . as our main result we obtained the diagram shown in fig .  [ diagram ] .",
    "interestingly , this diagram bears some similarity to the diagram of equilibrium potts model .",
    "in addition , we clarified the nature of the phase transition in the @xmath8 barw model without parity conservation . together with the work of szab and santos  @xcite for the parity conserving case , it confirms predictions of the field - theory for @xmath8 barw models by cardy and tuber  @xcite .",
    "although it requires considerable numerical efforts , it would be desirable to clarify the behaviour of the @xmath67 model .",
    "our results are inconclusive in this case , but a possibility that an interesting critical behaviour could be found should motivate further study .",
