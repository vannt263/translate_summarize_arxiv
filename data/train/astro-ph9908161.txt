    "although this does not significantly modify the abundances of the parent species , the relatively small abundance of a dissociation product may be of interest .",
    "a particularly important example is the dissociation of water to form oh . it is well - established that  is formed efficiently from oi in the hotter part of the shock front by endothermic reactions once @xmath5 ( draine , roberge & dalgarno 1983 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) .",

    "warm oh column densities in the range @xmath0@xmath1 are produced , consistent with the presence of oh(1720 mhz ) masers if the shock front harbouring the masers is propagating roughly perpendicular to the line of sight  as is expected because the masing column should have a small line - of - sight velocity gradient .",
    "the implications of these results are briefly discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the shock structure is assumed to be steady and plane - parallel with the magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "the medium is comprised of neutral and ionised fluids , with the magnetic field frozen into the ionised component and the ionised and neutral components coupled by elastic collisions .",
    "the ionisation fraction is low , so the inertia and thermal pressure of the ionised component are neglected .",
    "i follow kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) by writing the magnitude of the drag force per unit volume on the neutrals due to the drift of the charged species as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the densities of the ion and neutral components , @xmath15 is the preshock value of @xmath14 , and @xmath16 is the ion - neutral drift speed .",
    "the drag force is in the direction of the ion drift through the neutrals , and there is an equal and oppposite force per unit volume exerted on the ions by the neutrals .",
    "the coupling lengthscale @xmath17 is determined by the detailed composition of the ionised fluid , a mixture of molecular and metal ions , electrons and charged grains .",
    "the calculation of the upstream ionisation balance by kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) yields @xmath18 for the densities of interest here .",
    "the ionisation rate @xmath19 is generally assumed to be due to cosmic rays , but x - rays effect molecular gas similarly ( e.g.  maloney , hollenbach & tielens 1996 ) so both ionisation sources are notionally lumped together here .",
    "the cosmic - ray and x - ray ionisation rates depend on the environment : in dark clouds the standard interstellar cosmic - ray flux yields @xmath20 , whereas @xmath21 in molecular gas adjacent to supernova remnants .",
    "for example , for a remnant characterised by @xmath22 and a radius of 10 pc , @xmath23 ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionisation rate may also be of this order if the low - energy cosmic ray flux is increased by a factor of 100 over the local interstellar value , as seems to be the case for gev cosmic rays ( esposito et al .",
    "i therefore consider ionisation rates in the range @xmath24@xmath3 .    the ambipolar diffusion heating rate per unit volume , neglecting the heat capacity and radiative cooling by the ionised fluid , is @xmath25 ; heating by pdv work , and ionisations are also included .",
    "cooling is assumed to occur by collisional dissociation and vibrational transitions of  ( lepp & shull 1982 ) , and by rotational transitions of , , and co ( neufeld & kaufman 1993 ; neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) .",
    "the shock models include a simple reaction network sufficient to follow the oxygen chemistry : @xmath26 rates for collisional dissociation of  were obtained from lepp & shull ( 1982 ) ; and vibrationally cold rate coefficients for ( [ eq : o+h2])([eq : oh+o ] ) were taken from wagner & graff ( 1987 ) apart from their forward rate for ( [ eq : oh+oh ] ) which is ill - behaved below 300k  the rate coefficient from the rate95 database ( millar , farqhar & willacy 1997 ) is adopted instead .",

    "the shock structure for an ionisation rate @xmath32 , typical of cosmic - ray ionisation in molecular clouds , is presented in the top panel of fig . [",
    "fig : low_ionisation_rate ] .",
    "the velocities are plotted in the shock frame , in which the shock is stationary , with the unshocked gas flowing in from @xmath33 at the shock speed ( i.e. @xmath34 , being decelerated within the shock front and departing downstream towards @xmath35 .",
    "the middle panel shows the chemical abundances obtained when dissociations by internally - generated fuv photons are neglected .",
    "as has been found previously ( draine et al 1983 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) the preshock atomic oxygen is almost entirely incorporated into water , with oh appearing briefly as an intermediate step . for comparison ,",
    "the lower panel shows the effect of including dissociations by internally - generated fuv .",
    "the overall chemistry is not drastically affected , but dissociation of water produces an increasing abundance of oh downstream , with a significant column having accumulated by the time the gas has cooled to 50k .",
    "note also the gradual reappearance of oi downstream through the dissociation of oh and .",
    "the effect of raising the ionisation rate to @xmath36 , as produced by x - rays in a molecular cloud adjacent to a snr , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : high_ionisation_rate ] .",
    "the ionisation fraction of the preshock gas is increased by a factor of @xmath37 , reducing the thickness of the shock transition and the time scale for gas to flow through the shock front by the same factor .",
    "the peak neutral temperature increases because the energy dissipated in the shock must be radiated away on a shorter time scale .",
    "heating associated with ionisations , which is unimportant within the shock front , increases 30-fold and so the final postshock temperature increases slightly .",
    "the photodissociation rate is increased 30-fold , with a concomitant increase in the production of oh and oi .",
    "[ fig : oh_column ] summarises the production of oh within the shock models by plotting the run of oh column density with temperature within the shock front for different ionisation rates .",
    "an initial ` burst ' of oh column is produced as oxygen is rapidly converted to water in the high - temperature portion of the shock front .",
    "the column produced during this phase decreases as the ionisation rate is increased because the oh destroying forward reaction in ( [ eq : oh+h2 ] ) is strongly temperature dependent , and the temperature within the shock rises more rapidly for high ionisation rates because of the increase in the rate of ambipolar diffusion heating . if the fuv dissociation is neglected no more oh is produced ( dashed curves ) ; otherwise oh starts to be produced once the temperature of the shocked gas has dropped sufficiently so that the forward reaction in ( [ eq : oh+h2 ] ) has slowed sufficiently to permit photodissociations to become effective . for high ionisation rates",
    "the increase in the photodissociation rate ( @xmath38 ) is partially offset by the decrease in flow time scale ( @xmath39 ) ; thus n@xmath40 in the cooling gas .",
    "the line - of - sight column density of warm oh through a c - type shock is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle between the shock normal and the line of sight . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "n@xmath45 is sufficient to permit the formation of oh(1720 mhz ) masers , thus typical x - ray fluxes near snrs are able to produce the warm oh column necessary for oh(1720 mhz ) masers .",
    "lockett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have argued that the x - ray flux from snrs is @xmath46 of the level that could produce the oh column density necessary for masing in the 1720 mhz line .",
    "this discrepancy can be traced to the conversion from x - ray energy flux @xmath47 to ionisation rate .",
    "both wardle et al .  ( 1998 ) and lockett et al .  ( 1999 ) used the conversion @xmath48 ( maloney et al .",
    "1996 ) , but this assumes a hard x - ray spectrum appropriate to agns .",
    "the softer ( @xmath49 ) spectrum from the hot gas in snrs produces many more ionisations per unit x - ray luminosity , as ionisations are dominated by low - energy x - ray photons . in this case , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mean number of primary and secondary electrons produced by the absorption of unit energy , @xmath52 is the photoabsorption cross - section per hydrogen nucleus at 1 kev , and @xmath53 . with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "this yields @xmath56 provided that the hydrogen column density @xmath57 . note that externally - incident uv may make a similar contribution to the oh column if @xmath58 is not too large ( lockett et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the enhancement of oh described in this _ letter _ permits the structure and kinematics of c - type shock waves to be studied through the modelling of the excitation of oh throughout the shock front , and the calculation of emission and absorption line profiles .",
    "supernova remnants with associated 1720 mhz masers ( frail et al .  1994 , 1996 ; yusef - zadeh et al .  1995 , 1996 , 1999a , b ; green et al .  1997 ; koralesky et al .",

    "for example , w28 shows extended oh absorption around the oh maser positions ( pastchenko & slysh 1974 ; claussen et al .",
    "the predicted warm oh column within c - type shocks implies substantial far - infrared emission in low - lying oh rotational transitions",
