    "many novel materials find themselves close to the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , where strong electron - electron interactions and disorder are believed to give rise to a variety of complex phenomena.@xcite near the mit , these two effects are usually comparable in magnitude , so that their competition is expected to lead to glassy behavior of electrons , in analogy with other frustrated systems.@xcite a common denominator for all glasses is the existence of a complex or `` rugged '' free energy landscape ( fel ) , consisting of a large number of metastable states , separated by barriers of different heights .",
    "this results in phenomena such as slow , nonexponential relaxations , divergence of the equilibration time , and breaking of ergodicity , i.e. the inability of the system to equilibrate on experimental time scales .",
    "therefore , such out - of - equilibrium systems also exhibit aging effects,@xcite where the response to an external excitation ( i.e. relaxation ) depends on the system history in addition to the time @xmath8 . a detailed analysis of temporal fluctuations ( noise ) of the relevant observables yields complementary information on configurational rearrangements or transitions between metastable states .",
    "non - gaussian distributions of various observables in glassy systems have been reported,@xcite reflecting the presence of large , _ collective _ rearrangements .",
    "most experimental studies of charge or coulomb glasses have focused on situations where electrons are strongly localized due to disorder , far from the mit.@xcite in recent years , however , a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in si metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) has emerged as an excellent model system for studying glassy or out - of - equilibrium charge dynamics near the mit.@xcite in particular , studies of both relaxations and noise on very disordered samples have established that the 2des in si exhibits all the main manifestations of glassiness : slow , correlated dynamics ( non - gaussian noise),@xcite nonexponential relaxations,@xcite diverging equilibration time ( as temperature @xmath2),@xcite aging and memory.@xcite glassiness is observed for all carrier densities @xmath3 , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10  the critical density for the mit ) , thus giving rise to an intermediate glassy , `` bad metal '' phase ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12  fermi wave vector , @xmath13  mean free path ) . in a 2des with a relatively low amount of disorder ,",
    "noise studies show that the intermediate phase becomes vanishingly small , i.e. @xmath14.@xcite these observations are consistent with predictions of the theoretical models that describe the mit as a mott transition with disorder.@xcite the results presented here were obtained on samples with a relatively large amount of disorder , where the intermediate ( @xmath15 ) glassy phase is more pronounced , as mentioned above .",
    "we note that aging studies have found@xcite that an abrupt change in the nature of the glassy phase occurs at @xmath10 , i.e. at the 2d mit , signifying the intrinsic glassiness of the 2des .",
    "glassy dynamics in a 2des in si has been studied using several different experimental protocols , all of which involved rapid changes of @xmath1 ( `` @xmath5 protocol '' ) .",
    "for example , a large , rapid ( within 1  s ) change of @xmath1 at a low enough @xmath0 results in a nonexponential relaxation of conductivity @xmath16 towards a new equilibrium value.@xcite small changes of @xmath1 at low @xmath0 do not produce any observable relaxations,@xcite but have led to the observations of non - gaussian fluctuations in @xmath16.@xcite on the other hand , in other types of glasses ( e.g. structural , spin ) , studies of aging processes and other glassy properties are typically carried out following a thermal quench from an equilibrium state at a high @xmath0 to a nonequilibrium state at a low @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of the relaxations following such a thermal quench , however , is greatly complicated by their nontrivial dependence on the cooling time and , hence , a fairly fast cooling process is essential ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to establish whether the charge glass realized in a 2des in si also falls out of equilibrium as @xmath0 is reduced , in common to other types of glasses .",
    "here we investigate the charge dynamics in a 2des in si at low @xmath1 , near the mit , after cooling from an equilibrium state at a high @xmath0 with a fixed @xmath1 ( `` @xmath6 protocol '' ) . since it is not possible to achieve rapid cooling in our experimental set - up ( the shortest cooling time is about 30 minutes ) , we focus on the resulting fluctuations ( noise ) in @xmath16 .",

    "the effect of the density change was studied further by using a waiting - time ( @xmath7 ) protocol , in which @xmath1 is changed only temporarily during @xmath7 , but @xmath146 . as a result of such a large perturbation , the system exhibits visible relaxations of @xmath18 , i.e. aging.@xcite interestingly , the non - gaussian pdfs exhibit both history dependence and an evolution towards a gaussian shape as the system ages and slowly approaches equilibrium , similar to the behavior of a great variety of out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "the power spectra and the higher order noise statistics of the non - gaussian noise have been also investigated over a wide range of the applied bias voltage .",
    "the data demonstrate that the non - gaussian noise is observed in the regime of linear response , i.e. that it is not caused by the application of a high bias , but rather that it reflects the intrinsic out - of - equilibrium behavior of the 2des .",
    "in summary , we have established several new characteristics that the 2des in si has in common with a large class of both 2d and 3d out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "thus this work provides additional strong evidence that many such universal features are robust manifestations of glassiness , regardless of the dimensionality of the system .",
