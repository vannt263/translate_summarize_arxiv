    "during the epoch of cosmic reionization , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was ionized by the first astrophysical objects , and the universe became transparent to uv photons .",
    "measurements of cmb polarization @xcite and studies of high - redshift quasars @xcite have shown that reionization began earlier than @xmath8 and ended by @xmath9 .",
    "the process of reionization is complex , and it is still not clear how and when it exactly occurred .",
    "early observational studies were mostly based on high - redshift luminous quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , as the number of galaxies found at @xmath10 has increased dramatically , high - redshift galaxies have started to play an important role in the study of reionization .    in the last decade , a large number of ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) and lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath10 have been discovered by two complementary methods : the narrow - band technique and the dropout technique , respectively . in particular",
    ", the narrow - band ( or ly@xmath0 ) technique has a high success rate of spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "three atmospheric windows with little emission from oh sky lines in the optical are often used to search for galaxies at @xmath11 , 6.5 , and 7 .",
    "so far more than 200 laes have been spectroscopically confirmed at these redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a @xmath12 lae was confirmed recently @xcite , demonstrating the ability to detect distant galaxies with powerful ground - based telescopes .",
    "individual galaxies are usually too faint to provide useful information about the igm ionization state during the reionization era .",
    "however , much can be learned from their statistical properties , such as the evolution of the ly@xmath0  luminosity function ( lf ) , and the fraction of galaxies with strong ly@xmath0  emission lines among lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , recent studies have shown that the ly@xmath0  lf evolves rapidly from @xmath13 to 6.5 @xcite , while the evolution of the lae uv lf is far less severe .",
    "this was explained by the increasing neutral fraction of the igm from @xmath13 to 6.5 that attenuates ly@xmath0  emission via resonant scattering of ly@xmath0  photons . as such",
    ", one would expect a further decline of the ly@xmath0  lf at @xmath14 .",
    "although the @xmath15 lf has not been well determined due to the limited number of laes known at @xmath15 , the current data do seem to indicate such an evolutionary trend @xcite .",
    "the narrow - band technique is now being used to search for higher redshift laes at @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this redshift corresponds to an oh - dark window at @xmath161.06 @xmath17 m in the near - ir .",
    "each of these narrow - band surveys , except the one by @xcite , found several candidates .",
    "surprisingly , they also found that the ly@xmath0  lfs at @xmath1 derived from their photometric samples are consistent with the lf at @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "none of their lae candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "spectroscopic identification of these objects is very challenging , but is critical for understanding the properties of laes and the igm state during reionization . in this paper",
    "we present deep lbt / luci spectroscopy of a @xmath1 lae candidate found by @xcite . in section 2",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction .",
    "we then present our results in section 3 , and discuss the results in section 4 .",
    "we use a @xmath18-dominated flat cosmology with @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "our target ( hereafter laez7p7 ) is a lae candidate at @xmath1 selected from @xcite , who carried out a deep imaging survey of @xmath1 laes with two ultra narrow - band filters centered at 1.056 and 1.063 @xmath17 m .",
    "the filter width is @xmath23  .",
    "the survey volume is @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 , and the depth is 22.4 ab mag ( 50% completeness ) in the narrow band , corresponding to a ly@xmath0  flux limit of @xmath26 .",
    "they found four candidates down to the survey limit in the two bands .",
    "laez7p7 is the brightest one ( 21.87 ab mag in the @xmath27 m band ) with expected ly@xmath0  flux of @xmath28 .",
    "we observed laez7p7 using the infrared spectrograph luci @xcite on the @xmath2 m lbt on 11 december 2012 and 4 march 2013 ( ut ) .",
    "the observing conditions were good , with mostly clear sky and decent seeing ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the observations were made in longslit mode with a @xmath30 slit .",
    "we did a blind offset from a bright star to laez7p7 .",
    "the long slit had a position angle of 53.08 deg so that it covered another nearby star with @xmath31 mag .",
    "this star ( hereafter refstar ) is used as a reference object ( and as a standard star for flux calibration ) during the data reduction .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows the positions of these objects in the laez7p7 field .",
    "we chose to use the second order of the 200 h+k grating with a wavelength coverage of @xmath32  , centered at 1.1 @xmath17 m .",
    "this provides a resolving power @xmath33 .",
    "the exposure time for each science image was 900 seconds .",
    "the individual exposures were dithered along the slit .",
    "the total integration time was 7.5 hours .",
    "we also observed a standard star ukirt fs128 with the same configuration for the purpose of flux calibration .",
    "we reduced the luci data using standard methods based on our own customized pipeline @xcite .",
    "the basic procedure is as follows . for each raw science image",
    ", we first generated a 2-d wavelength map using many oh sky lines in the image .",
    "the closest dithered neighboring frame was then subtracted from this image .",
    "this step removed the dark current and some instrument - related artifacts , and also performed the first sky subtraction .",
    "next , the image was flat - fielded by a master flat image that was made from a series of flat images taken in the same night .",
    "a more accurate sky subtraction was performed with the @xcite algorithm .",
    "finally we rectified the reduced 2-d images ( raw images were curved ) , and interpolated them onto a uniform rectangular output wavelength grid based on the individual 2-d wavelength maps .    before we stacked these images , we shifted them along the spatial direction so that the bright refstar has the same position in all the images .",
    "the accurate position of refstar in each image was determined by fitting a gaussian profile to the average flux profile along the spatial direction .",
    "the images were then weighted on a frame - by - frame basis by sky transparency , seeing , and background variance .",
    "the transparency was measured by the relative flux of refstar .",
    "the variation of the transparency during the same run was very small ( a few percent ) .",
    "seeing was measured as the fwhm of the psf from refstar .",
    "the variance of background was calculated around the expected position of laez7p7 .",
    "a final combined 2-d image was created by stacking the weighted science images with a sigma ( @xmath34 ) rejection .",
    "the psf fwhm of refstar in the stacked image is @xmath35 , well consistent with those in input images .",
    "our main result is that we do not detect any convincing signal at the expected position of the laez7p7 ly@xmath0  emission line in our stacked spectroscopic image .",
    "as we will see , this image is deep enough to detect laez7p7 at a significance level of @xmath3 , if it is a @xmath36 lae with the expected ly@xmath0  flux given by @xcite . in figure 1 ,",
    "the right panel shows part of the stacked spectroscopic image . with the known pixel scale ( @xmath37 ) and wavelength map , the expected position of laez7p7 in the 2-d image",
    "is accurately determined .",
    "this position is in the middle of the box in the right panel .",
    "the box covers a range of 50   centered at 1.056 @xmath17 m .",
    "a zoomed - in version is shown in figure 3(e ) , and the extracted 1-d spectrum is given in figure 2 .",
    "close visual inspection shows that there is no sign of any significant detection at this position .",
    "we determine the absolute flux calibration using the standard star and refstar .",
    "their 1-d spectra are extracted within a 7-pixel ( @xmath38 ) window using iraf task apall .",
    "the standard star ukirt fs128 is a m5v star with @xmath39 mag .",
    "the system response curve is derived by comparing the observed spectrum of fs128 with the model spectrum of a m5v star .",
    "the spectrum of refstar is corrected with the response curve , and scaled to match its @xmath40-band photometry .",
    "the flux calibration ( or conversion between counts and flux ) derived from the two stars is consistent with each other ( @xmath41 mag ) , indicating that refstar ( and thus laez7p7 ) was placed in the middle of the slit .",
    "we calculate the background variance around the expected position of laez7p7 , and convert it to a @xmath42 detection per pixel using the absolute flux calibration .",
    "this @xmath42 limit is used to estimate the detection limit of our image . in order to do so",
    ", we generate a 2-d model ly@xmath0   spectrum for laez7p7 , based on the 1-d composite spectrum of @xmath5 laes given by @xcite .",
    "the model spectrum has the same pixel scale as our image .",
    "its psf fwhm is also @xmath35 .",
    "when extracted to 1-d spectrum , the model spectrum has the shape of the composite @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "the model spectrum is shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "the detection significance of a line depends on the number of pixels extracted .",
    "we calculate it in a box of 8   ( the filter width ) by @xmath30 ( 4 pixels ) . based on the @xmath42 limit derived above",
    ", we find that a line with @xmath43 should be detected at a @xmath44 level at its expected position in our image .",
    "another way to estimate the detection limit is commonly used for detecting faint objects in 2-d imaging data .",
    "we assume that the model lae is detected at @xmath45 in each of 5 contiguous pixels ( the 5 brightest pixels here ) . in this case",
    "we expect a @xmath46 detection for laez7p7 .",
    "this limit ( @xmath46 ) is lower than @xmath44 derived above .",
    "this is due to the low resolution and good seeing , which cause the flux to be highly concentrated in the central pixels .",
    "visual inspection is another powerful way to identify faint objects .",
    "we scale the model lae and place it at the expected position of laez7p7 .",
    "we then check whether we are able to identify it .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the expected position of laez7p7 , i.e. , the central part of the box in figure 1 .",
    "the model ly@xmath0  line is scaled to be 5 , 2 , and 1 times the estimated ly@xmath0  flux of laez7p7 .",
    "the scaled spectra are placed at the expected position , shown in panels ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the images on the right - hand side are the gaussian smoothed images .",
    "the figure demonstrates that laez7p7 can be clearly identified , if its ly@xmath0   emission line is as strong as the value given by @xcite .",
    "in fact , if laez7p7 is a real lae , its ly@xmath0  flux is likely higher than this value , because the 1.056 @xmath17 m filter is very narrow , and is very likely to only cover part of the ly@xmath0  line .",
    "we emphasize that the laez7p7 nominal position during our observations was securely located within the slit , with minimum slit losses owing to excellent seeing .",
    "this is ensured by two facts .",
    "one is the consistency of the flux calibration between refstar and the standard star , as we discussed earlier .",
    "the other fact is the detection of a very faint galaxy ( @xmath47 mag ) in the same slit .",
    "this object was well aligned with laez7p7 and refstar , and was serendipitously covered by the slit ( faint galaxy in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we detect both line and continuum emission for the galaxy .",
    "this ensures that laez7p7 was in the middle of the slit .",
    "in addition , the detection of such a faint object ( figure 2 ) indicates that the image depth is very good .",
    "with our deep lbt / luci spectroscopy , we have ruled out the existence of a strong emission line at @xmath48 @xmath17 m in laez7p7 , although this is not sufficient for us to fully explain the nature of this object .",
    "the photometric samples of @xmath1 laes ( and all other high - redshift galaxies ) , especially those with single - band detections , could be contaminated by various interlopers , such as low - redshift red or dusty galaxies , galactic late - type dwarf stars , variable ( or transient ) objects , and even noise spikes .",
    "the contamination in lae samples has been discussed in the previously mentioned lae papers ( also see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the rarity of @xmath1 galaxies , even if the vast majority of contaminants can be removed with careful selection , a tiny fraction of them could dominate a sample , highlighting the importance of spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "the non - detection of laez7p7 allows us to put a constraint on the bright - end ly@xmath0  lf at @xmath1 .",
    "the @xcite survey has a volume of @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 , and found one candidate lae ( laez7p7 ) with ly@xmath0  flux higher than @xmath49 .",
    "this translates to an upper limit of the spatial density at the bright end ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the upper limit ( red circle ) , compared to previous results .",
    "the dashed blue and green lines illustrate the strong decline of the bright - end ly@xmath0  lf from @xmath11 to 6.5 @xcite .",
    "this has been explained by an increasing neutral fraction of the igm . as such",
    ", we expect to see further decline of the ly@xmath0  lf towards higher redshift .",
    "the constraints from the @xmath50 lae ( magenta circle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the @xmath51 lae ( cyan circle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from laez7p7 suggest such a trend between @xmath52 and 7.7 .",
    "note that the above laes at @xmath50 and 7.22 were discovered in much larger survey volumes .",
    "the combination of this work and previous work enables us to put a more stringent constraint on the ly@xmath0  lf .",
    "@xcite did not find any @xmath1 laes in their survey .",
    "although @xcite found 7 lae candidates , none of their 5 brightest candidates was confirmed by follow - up spectroscopy , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "a conservative summary is that , in the above three surveys , including @xcite , there is no @xmath1 lae with ly@xmath0  emission higher than @xmath49 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if we assume a non - evolution of ly@xmath0  lf from @xmath5 to 7.7 , we expect to find @xmath53 laes down to the above flux limit , based on the lf of @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding zero laes is 0.0025 , under the assumption of a poisson distribution . by combining the three surveys ,",
    "the uncertainty due to cosmic variance has been largely reduced , and the poisson statistical uncertainty dominates the uncertainty of the lf .",
    "note that there is a discrepancy between the @xcite lfs and the @xcite lfs , but they are roughly consistent at the brightest end .",
    "the non - detection in the three studies translates to an upper limit of the bright - end ly@xmath0  lf at @xmath1 .",
    "the black circle in figure 4 represents this upper limit ( corresponding to the detection of one lae ) .",
    "this limit is much stronger than that from laez7p7 alone .",
    "it shows a rapid evolution of the ly@xmath0  lf at the bright end from @xmath5 to 7.7 : the upper limit of the @xmath1 lf is a factor of 6 times lower than the @xmath5 lf .",
    "the decline of the ly@xmath0  lf does not necessarily mean an increasing fraction of neutral igm , since this could also be caused by the intrinsic luminosiy and/or density evolution of laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "with limited information , we can not rule out any intrinsic evolution .",
    "in particular , we know that the uv lf of lbgs evolves at this redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such a rapid change of the lf in figure 4 is not likely to be due mainly to intrinsic evolution , because the time interval between @xmath54 and 7.7 is only 165 myr , and the physical properties of laes evolve slowly at @xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the increasing optical depth of the ly@xmath0  forest towards @xmath56 quasars indicates a rapid rise in the igm neutral fraction .",
    "because of radiative transfer effects , the ly@xmath0  emission line is largely shaped by its environment and more attenuated by a higher fraction of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the neutral fraction is still very small ( @xmath57% ) @xcite , yet it may already cause strong suppression on the ly@xmath0  emission ( figure 4 ) .",
    "a recently discovered quasar at @xmath58 @xcite was estimated to have a neutral fraction of @xmath1610% in the surrounding igm @xcite .",
    "we thus expect a much higher neutral fraction of the igm at @xmath1 than that at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath0  emission of @xmath1 laes would be strongly suppressed , which is broadly consistent with the observational trend in figure 4 .",
    "finally , we estimate the fraction of observed ly@xmath0  flux that is reduced by neutral igm at @xmath1 .",
    "we assume a pure luminosity evolution of the ly@xmath0  lf from @xmath5 to 7.7 .",
    "we also assume that such evolution was caused by the igm .",
    "the black line in figure 4 shows the evolved @xmath5 lf matched to the lf upper limit ( black circle ) at @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the ly@xmath0  luminosity at @xmath1 is reduced by at least a factor of two compared to that at @xmath5 .",
