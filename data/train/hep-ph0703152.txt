    "some of the _ gedanken_experiments discussed in the early days of quantum mechanics ( qm ) by its founding fathers have been recently reanalyzed in their original form or in slightly modified versions .",
    "these reanalyses have allowed an experimental confirmation of the qm predictions and deep insights into the heart of qm .",
    "good examples are recent researches on basic subjects such as bohr s complementarity principle or other subtle qm issues which featured when the theory had already been completed , e.g. , the so called einstein , podolsky and rosen paradox and the closely related subject of bell inequalities .",
    "most of this progress has been achieved thanks to the many advances in quantum optics and photonic experiments , however , the improved technologies also allowed to perform such tests with atoms and ions .",
    "the purpose of the present contribution is to show that high energy physics systems , such as kaons , can also be considered to discuss basic questions of qm and that sometimes they are more instructive and simple than their photonic or atomic analogues .",
    "we review a series of recent papers dealing with qm issues using neutral kaons as the relevant quantum states .",
    "we start in sect .",
    "[ tnks ] with a short summary of the required neutral kaon formalism paying attention to the quantum measurements and to entangled kaon states . in sect .",
    "[ quco ] we discuss a quantitative version of bohr s complementarity for single neutral kaon states .",
    "entangled kaon pairs are then used to introduce a kaonic ` quantum eraser ' in sect .",
    "[ qe ] which may be tested at the @xmath0factory .",
    "we then end with the subtle topic of bell inequalities with neutral kaons in sect .",
    "neutral kaons are pseudoscalar mesons consisting of a quark  antiquark bound state , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these two states define the ` strangeness ' or ` strong  interaction ' basis : @xmath5 and @xmath6 with strangeness @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "this is the suitable basis to analyze @xmath9conserving electromagnetic and strong interaction processes , such as the creation of @xmath10 systems from non  strange initial states ( e.g. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and the detection of neutral kaons via strong kaon  nucleon interactions .",
    "this ` strangeness ' basis is orthonormal , @xmath13 .",
    "weak interaction phenomena allow for strangeness non ",
    "conservation thus introducing new effects such as @xmath14@xmath15 oscillations as well as neutral kaon time evolution and decay .",
    "all these phenomena , together with kaon propagation in a medium with its associated regeneration effects , require the use of other relevant bases .    the ` free ",
    "space ' basis , @xmath2 , consists of the so called @xmath16short and @xmath16long states which are the normalized eigenvectors of the effective weak hamiltonian @xmath17 governing neutral kaon time evolution in free  space : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the @xmath21violation parameter @xcite and @xmath22 is the kaon proper time .",
    "the ( complex ) eigenvalues of the ( non  hermitian ) hamiltonian @xmath17 are @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses and decay widths .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath26 \\to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|k^0 \\rangle\\pm |\\bar{k^0 } \\rangle\\right]~ , \\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath27 . in the final expressions ,",
    "@xmath21violating effects have been ignored .",
    "this is reasonable due to the smallness of the @xmath21violation parameter @xmath20 and defines the two orthogonal @xmath21 eigenstates @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the @xmath32 time evolution shows no oscillation between these two states and , according to eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) , it is given by @xmath33 the @xmath34 states define a quasi ",
    "orthonormal basis : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "while the @xmath2 basis is useful to discuss free  space propagation , the @xmath21basis describes weak kaon decays either into two or three final pions from the @xmath37 or @xmath38 states , respectively .      a generic neutral ",
    "kaon state is a ` qubit ' in a ` quasispin space ' , i.e. , a quantum superposition of the two states of any of the previous bases , @xmath39 or @xmath2 , associated to the strangeness or lifetime quantum measurements , respectively .",
    "the former measurement requires the introduction of a nucleonic medium in the kaon trajectory , the latter is performed by allowing for kaon free  space propagation . indeed ,",
    "when a kaon ",
    "nucleon reaction occurs at a given place of the inserted medium , the distinct strong interactions of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 components on the bound nucleons inside the medium project the arbitrary state of an incoming kaon into one of the two members of the strangeness basis @xcite .",
    "the quantum number @xmath9 of the kaon state is determined by identifying the products of the strangeness conserving kaon ",
    "nucleon strong interaction .",
    "this measurement is then analogous to the projective von neumann measurements with two  channel analyzers for polarized photons or stern ",
    "gerlach setups for spin@xmath42 particles .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency for such strangeness measurements at moderate kaon energies as in @xmath43 and @xmath44 is certainly less than what one naively expects from the strong nature of these interactions @xcite .",
    "the reason , rather than being the difficulty in detecting the final state particles , stems from the low probability in initiating the strong reaction .",
    "indeed , the efficiency to _ induce _ a kaon ",
    "nucleon interaction at a given time turns out to be close to @xmath45 only for infinitely dense materials or for ultrarelativistic kaons . to measure",
    "if a kaon is propagating in free  space as a @xmath46 or @xmath47 at a given time @xmath22 , one has to allow for further propagation in free ",
    "space and then detect at which time it subsequently decays .",
    "kaons which show a decay vertex between times @xmath22 and @xmath48 have to be identified as @xmath46 s , while those decaying later than @xmath48 have to be identified as @xmath47 s .",
    "since there are no @xmath46@xmath47 oscillations , such subsequent decays do really identify the state at the desired previous time @xmath22 .",
    "the probabilities for wrong @xmath46 and @xmath47 identification are then given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "choosing @xmath51 , both misidentification probabilities reduce to @xmath52% .",
    "since the lifetime eigenstates are not strictly orthogonal to each other , their identification can not be exact even in principle .",
    "however , @xmath20 is so small and the decay probabilities of the two components so different ( @xmath53 ) that the @xmath46 vs @xmath47 discrimination can effectively work @xcite .",
    "note also that , contrary to strangeness measurements , @xmath46 vs @xmath47 identification is not affected by low efficiencies if detectors with very large solid angles are used .",
    "the above measurement methods are appropriate to establish bell inequalities and tests @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the two measurements correspond to complementary observables , with dichotomic outcomes in both cases . on the other hand , being performed by exerting the free will of the experimenter , they are _ active _ measurement procedures . however ,",
    "contrary to what happens in other two  level quantum systems , such as spin@xmath42 particles or photons , _ passive _ measurements are also possible for neutral kaons @xcite by randomly exploiting the qm dynamics of kaon decays .",
    "to this aim , one has to allow for complete free  space propagation and observe the various kaon decay modes . by neglecting @xmath21violation effects",
    ", kaon decays into two and three pions permit the identification of @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s , respectively .",
    "alternatively , the strangeness of a given kaon state is measured by observing its semileptonic decays .",
    "these decays obey the well tested @xmath54 rule , which allows the modes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , but forbids decays into the respective charge ",
    "conjugate final states @xcite .",
    "these procedures for the passive @xmath46 vs @xmath47 and @xmath58 vs @xmath15 discriminations are unambiguous in the approximations given by @xmath21conservation and the @xmath54 rule , respectively . however , the experimenter has no control on the time when the measurement occurs , nor on the basis in which it is performed , in contrast with the previous active procedure . as a result ,",
    "the so called kasday construction @xcite invalidates bell inequality tests performed with such passive measurements @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most often discussed bipartite state is the spin singlet state consisting of two photons or two spin1/2 particles , as first proposed by d.  bohm @xcite .",
    "let us then first consider the analogous two  kaon entangled state @xcite .",
    "both @xmath59resonance decays @xcite and @xmath60wave proton ",
    "antiproton annihilations @xcite produce the @xmath61 initial state : @xmath62 and @xmath63 denoting the ` left ' and ` right ' directions of motion of the two separating kaons .",
    "the weak , @xmath21violating effects enter only in the last equality .    after production , the left and",
    "right moving kaons evolve according to eq .",

    "this state shows maximal entanglement in both lifetime and strangeness .",
    "this state ( [ timeentangled ] ) is analogous to the polarization  entangled two  photon [ idler ( @xmath71 ) plus signal ( @xmath60 ) ] state used in different optical tests : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an adjustable relative phase and @xmath74 and @xmath75 refer to vertical and horizontal polarizations . for entangled kaons",
    ", @xmath76 plays the role of @xmath73 and induces strangeness oscillations in time which can be used to mimic the different orientations of polarization analyzers in photonic bell ",
    "tests @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the two terms in the photonic state have the same weight but that this is not the case in the two  kaon states ( [ timeentangled ] ) .",
    "the entanglement of the kaonic state ( [ timeentangled ] ) has been tested experimentally at cplear over macroscopic distances and using active strangeness measurements @xcite .",
    "the non  separability of this state has also been observed at the daphne @xmath0factory using passive measurements @xcite ; with some modification of the set  up , this could be possible by active measurements too .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors analyzed the possibility of a spontaneous wave  function factorization , which was proposed by schrdinger and furry in @xmath77 . if a factorization in the @xmath78 basis is assumed , the qm interference term is simply multiplied by @xmath79 @xmath80 = { 1 \\over 4 }   \\left\\{1- 2(1- \\zeta ) \\frac{\\cos(\\delta m \\delta \\tau )   e^{-(\\gamma_s+\\gamma_l)(\\tau_l + \\tau_r)/2 } } { e^{-\\gamma_s \\tau_l -\\gamma_l \\tau_r } + e^{-\\gamma_l \\tau_l+\\tau_r)}}\\right\\}~ , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the ` decoherence parameter ' , @xmath82 , characterizing the strength of the interaction of the entangled state with the environment .",
    "if a factorization in the @xmath83 basis is assumed then it is a bit more complicated .",
    "now one can compare these models with the experimental data from the cplear experiment @xcite and a recent experiment of the kloe  collaboration at daphne @xcite @xmath84 the results in the @xmath85 basis of the kloe experiment benefits from large cancellations between the interference term and the two terms that occur for the @xmath21 suppressed final state @xmath86 .",
    "as it is well known since long time , the observation of an interference pattern and the acquisition of ` which way ' information are mutually excluded in interferometric devices .",
    "however , quantitative statements of this complementarity principle have become available only recently .",
    "the quality of an interference pattern can be quantified in terms of the ` fringe visibility ' @xmath87 , where @xmath88 stand for the maximum and minimum measured intensities . in general , for a two  path interferometer the intensity is @xmath89 , where @xmath59 is the phase difference between the two paths . the amount of which  path information is given by the ` predictability ' @xcite @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the probability to take the interferometric path @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "then , complementarity can be expressed in the quantitative form @xmath94 where the equal sign is valid for pure states .",
    "the evolution of a single kaon state can be interpreted in terms of this duality relation @xcite . by normalizing to kaons surviving up to time @xmath22 and neglecting @xmath21violation effects",

    "( [ qc ] ) , @xmath99 .",
    "this clearly shows the interferometric behaviour of neutral kaon evolution , where the @xmath46 and @xmath47 components play the role of the two interferometric paths @xcite .",
    "the quantum eraser is a subtle phenomenon originally proposed by scully and dr@xmath100hl @xcite and recently reviewed by aharonov and zubairy @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in several atomic and photonic experiments but it can be performed , with some advantages , by using neutral kaons @xcite .    in this type of analyses",
    "one considers variations of the basic double  slit experiment . in a two  way experiment ,",
    "interference patterns are observed if and only if it is impossible to know , _ even in principle _ , which way the particle took .",

    "procedure which way the _ object _ particle took ; whether or not the outcome of the corresponding ` which way ' observation , performed on the _ meter _ particle , is actually read out , it does not matter : interference is in any way lost .",
    "for a two  particle entangled state , if the path of one member is marked , information on the path taken by its entangled partner is in principle available and no interference fringes can be observed .",
    "but , if that ` which way ' mark is erased by means of a suitable measurement _quantum erasure_ , interferences reappear in joint detection events .    for neutral kaons",
    ", the phenomenon of @xmath58@xmath15 oscillations plays the role of the standard interference fringes .",
    "similarly , the @xmath46 and @xmath47 states , showing a distinct propagation in free  space , are the analogs of the two separated trajectories in interferometers .",
    "consider the two  kaon entangled state ( [ timeentangled ] ) .",
    "the _ object _ kaon flying to the left hand side is always measured _ actively _ in the strangeness basis .",

    "the kaon flying to the right hand side , the _ meter _ ,",
    "is always measured _ actively _ at a fixed time @xmath101 , either in the strangeness or in the lifetime basis . in the latter case",

    ", one notes that the oscillating probabilities ( [ lsprob ] ) and ( [ usprob ] ) are even functions of @xmath106 .",
    "which measurement , left or right , is first performed is then irrelevant and the quantum eraser can be operated in the so  called ` delayed choice ' mode @xcite . in this mode , the decision to observe or not strangeness oscillations when scanning the object kaon can be taken once this kaon has already been detected by performing a future measurement of strangeness or lifetime on the meter kaon .",
    "these latter comments also add some light to the very nature of the quantum eraser working principle : the way in which joint detection events are _ classified _ according to the available information . in the ` delayed choice ' mode",
    ", a series of strangeness measurements is performed at different @xmath64 times on the object kaons and the corresponding outcomes are recorded . later one can measure either lifetime or strangeness on the corresponding meter partner and , only then , full information allowing for a definite sorting of each pair is available . choosing to perform strangeness measurements on",
    "the meter kaons amounts to completely erase the ` which width ' information on each pair in such a way that oscillations and complementary anti  oscillations appear in the corresponding subsets .",
    "the alternative choice of lifetime measurements on meter kaons , instead , does not offer the possibility to classify the events in oscillatory subsets as before .",

    "further discussions on this subject can be found in refs .",

    "et al . _ in 1969 , ref .",
    "@xcite , which is an extension of bell s proof under more realistic assumptions .",
    "one finds @xmath107 for kaons , each experimenter has choices of two different kinds : one choice refers to the ` quasispin ' state and the other to the time the kaon propagates until the measurement .",
    "the situation is then somehow more interesting than in the photonic case but also more involved because of the kaon evolution and decay . as in the usual photon setup",
    ", alice and bob can choose among two settings , i.e. , alice : @xmath108 and bob : @xmath109 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath110 denotes then that alice chooses to measure the quasispin @xmath111 at time @xmath112 on the kaon propagating to her side and bob chooses to measure @xmath113 at time @xmath114 on his kaon .",
    "if we fix the quasispins to the strangeness eigenstates , we obtain a bell inequality depending on four times , which is in close analogy to photonic cases .",
