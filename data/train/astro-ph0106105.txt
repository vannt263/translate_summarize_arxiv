    "the collapsed cores of massive stars are relativistic bodies .",
    "in addition to relativistic effects , convection and rapid rotation may play important roles in core collapse supernovae , making their accurate simulation a three - dimensional ( 3d ) endeavor . because accurate and stable numerical solutions to 3d relativistic problems are difficult to achieve",
    ", an approximation that captures the relativistic phenomena most relevant to supernovae is desirable .",
    "( more detailed discussion of these points , together with references , are given in the following paragraphs . )    while relativistic treatments would be necessary to follow the detailed processes leading to black hole formation , even collapse events leading to neutron stars ought to be treated relativistically , particularly at late times . denoting the gravitational potential by @xmath0",
    ", the newtonian limit is obtained from the einstein equations using the metric @xmath1 provided @xmath2 and velocities are much less than the speed of light . taking @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be the mass and radius of the collapsed core , the gravitational potential is expected to be of order @xmath5 while infall and/or ejecta velocities of order @xmath6 might be encountered .",
    "if some collapsed cores are born with rotation periods comparable to observed millisecond pulsars , equatorial velocities would be of order @xmath7 crudely taking the core as a cold degenerate gas of nucleons of mass @xmath8 and fermi momentum @xmath9 , nucleon velocities of order @xmath10 clearly indicate that pressure and internal energy density can not be neglected as gravitational sources .",
    "the numerical coefficients in equations ( [ potentialestimate]-[nucleonvelocity ] ) may seem to overstate the case for relativity immediately after core bounce , when a less massive inner core has a larger radius .",
    "they are perhaps more relevant numbers for late times , when the final explosion energy @xcite and remnant nature ( neutron star vs. black hole ) are determined .",
    "however , even at earlier times relativity can not be ignored : detailed comparisons of newtonian and relativistic simulations in spherical symmetry show more compact cores and higher neutrino luminosities and average energies in relativistic treatments @xcite . because of indications that small ( several percent ) variations in , for example , neutrino luminosities and shock stagnation radius can make the difference between a successful ( exploding ) and a failed supernova @xcite , it is clear that even modest relativistic effects comprise an indispensible component of realism in supernova studies .",
    "the multidimensional nature of supernovae must also be recognized as an important aspect of realism .",
    "various observations , especially data from sn 1987a , point to the asphericity of supernova explosions ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview , and @xcite for a recent polarimetry analysis of several supernovae ) . convection  either deep in the core and driven by a lepton gradient @xcite or doubly - diffusive phenomena ( `` neutron fingers '' ) @xcite , or in the more tenuous region between the neutrinosphere and the stalled shock , driven by an entropy gradient @xcite  has for some time been suggested as a means of boosting neutrino luminosities or increasing the efficiency of heating the material behind the stalled shock .",
    "the results of various simulations in up to two dimensions ( 2d ) differ as to the significance of convective effects @xcite ; clearly further study is necessary .",
    "beyond convection , a pioneering 2d simulation studied jet production by magnetic fields in a supernova context @xcite , and simulations of explosions from collapsed stars with phenomenologically introduced jets have also been performed in 2d @xcite .",
    "these 2d simulations have yielded interesting results , but ultimately consideration of the third dimension will be necessary . based on an initial exploration of 3d effects , it has been reported @xcite that the sizes of convective cells in 3d simulations are about half as large as in 2d simulations . moreover",
    ", rapid rotation can significantly affect the strength and spatial distribution of convection @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of magnetic field generation , jet formation , and neutron star kicks also invite 3d treatments .",
    "including all the physics necessary for realism in a supernova simulation is a daunting task .",
    "the multidimensional simulations mentioned above , which had simplified neutrino transport , taxed the computational resources of their time ; the same is true of recent simulations involving boltzmann transport in spherical symmetry @xcite . adding general relativity to the list of desired physics makes things all the more challenging . while numerical relativity has been successful in spherical and axisymmetric cases , `` ... in the general three - dimensional ( 3d ) case which is needed for the simulation of realistic astrophysical systems , it has not been possible to obtain stable and accurate evolutions ... , '' and it is argued that the difficulties are more fundamental than insufficient resolution @xcite . while the difficulties with 3d numerical relativity are beginning to be overcome @xcite , the computations are `` prohibitively slow '' @xcite when the central gravitating body has a modest compactness ( @xmath11 ) . hence it will be some time before supernova simulations with sophisticated microphysics and transport can cover the full process of collapse , explosion , and wind formation over hundreds of milliseconds in a fully relativistic context .    in order to overcome the difficulties associated with 3d general relativistic simulations , and to save resources for 3d hydrodynamics and accurate neutrino transport , an approximate treatment of gravity that captures",
    "the phenomena of dynamical importance in supernovae would be desirable .",
    "the list of new gravitational phenomena introduced by relativity includes the nonlinearity of the gravitational field , the inclusion of all forms of energy and stress as sources , and gravitational waves .",
    "the first two of these effects are of dynamical importance in supernovae , while gravitational waves will probably not exert a strong back - reaction ( unless bar or breakup instabilities of some sort become operative in the core ) . given the effects we wish to capture , what sort of approximation might we try ?",
    "a common procedure in the literature has been to assume a spherical mass distribution in implementing gravity , which allows a relativistic treatment",
    ". however , for rapidly rotating progenitors this introduces errors of about 10% during collapse and bounce , with errors rising at later times as the nascent neutron star cools @xcite .",
    "a multidimensional approach that captures relativistic phenomena could reduce these inaccuracies .",
    "a 3d post - newtonian approach might be considered , but the post - newtonian limit is known to be inadequate for quantitative determinations of neutron star properties . the case of spherical neutron stars constructed with a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) with adiabatic index @xmath12 ( a common proxy for more realistic dense matter eoss ) is illustrative : when the polytropic constant is chosen to make the maximum mass in a fully relativistic calculation equal to @xmath13 , the maximum mass determined by first - order post - newtonian calculations is @xmath14an error of close to 60% @xcite .",
    "we conclude that an approach that both probes the nonlinear nature of gravity more deeply , and does so in multidimensions , would be desirable in the supernova context .",
    "a method that could be incorporated into existing newtonian hydrodynamics codes would be even more useful .",
    "we describe such an approximation  which we call `` newtonplus''in  2 , displaying a full set of einstein equations in order to see where inconsistencies arise and how serious they are in the supernova environment .",
    "hydrodynamics equations for the radial direction are presented in  3 in order to argue that the approach could be implemented in existing codes . in ",
    "4 we display results for rapidly rotating ( and therefore highly deformed ) stars , which show that this simple `` newtonplus '' approach to gravity is indeed a significant improvement over the newtonian limit .",
    "concluding remarks , including comments about certain approximate approaches to gravity employed in binary neutron star calculations , are given in  5 .",
    "an appendix shows how the static limit of our formulation relates to the familiar equations of stellar structure in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , use of the metric of eq .",
    "( [ newtonmetric ] ) in the einstein equations yields the newtonian limit , provided the gravitational potential @xmath2 and velocities ( including microscopic velocities , large values of which lead to significant stresses ) are much less than the speed of light . in order to capture the nonlinearity of gravity , the significance of stresses as gravitational sources , and relativistic fluid velocities , we propose the use of the following metric : @xmath15 where @xmath16 . in comparison with eq .",
    "( [ newtonmetric ] ) , the `` linearized '' metric functions have been promoted to full exponentials , and a second metric function , @xmath17 , has been added .",
    "( [ newtonplusmetric ] ) will then reduce to the newtonian case if @xmath18 ; we shall see that this is in fact the case under conditions in which the newtonian limit is valid .",
    "this provides a tight conceptual link with the newtonian limit .",
    "since it has two independent metric functions , this `` newtonplus '' metric also provides an exact solution in spherical symmetry .",
    "( for the static case , the appendix shows the connection between our formulation and the familiar equations in schwarzschild coordinates . )",
    "a convenient formulation of the einstein equations is the ( 3 + 1 ) formalism , in which spacetime is foliated into spacelike slices labeled by a time coordinate @xcite .",
    "the metric can be expressed @xmath19 where the latin indices run over the three spatial coordinates .",
    "as originally conceptualized , the four quantities @xmath20 ( the lapse function ) and @xmath21 ( the shift vector ) could be chosen at will as a `` gauge choice '' or as `` coordinate conditions , '' corresponding to the invariance of general relativity under coordinate transformations .",
    "four constraint equations  the so - called hamiltonian constraint and momentum constraints  would be solved to provide self - consistent data on the initial spacelike slice .",
    "the six degrees of freedom to evolve in time would then be the @xmath22 , determined by equations second order in space and time .",
    "alternatively , one could evolve equations first order in time for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; the latter is the extrinsic curvature tensor , which describes the embedding of the spacelike slices in spacetime . as an alternative to prescribing @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one can , for example , place conditions on @xmath23 ; then @xmath20 and @xmath21 become quantities for which solutions must be found .",
    "it is apparent that the newtonplus metric of eq .",
    "( [ newtonplusmetric ] ) contains only two of the six degrees of freedom that should be present .",
    "this means that examination of a complete set of einstein equations should reveal inconsistencies ; we here explore these and discuss their seriousness in the supernova environment .",
    "we begin with the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this yields @xmath24 in this expression @xmath25 is the usual 3d flat - space laplacian .",
    "the energy density as viewed by an `` eulerian '' observer ( i.e. , one whose 4-velocity is orthogonal to the spacelike slices , having covariant components @xmath26 , where @xmath20 is the lapse function ) is denoted by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the stress - energy tensor . for a perfect fluid , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the magnitude of the physical fluid velocity as measured by an eulerian observer , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the total energy density and pressure in the fluid rest frame .",
    "we have employed the notation @xmath34 as expected from the conceptual link between the newtonian and newtonplus metrics , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianconstraint ] ) identifies @xmath0 as a glorified gravitational potential .",
    "in addition to the rest energy , the source includes internal and kinetic energies and pressure , all boosted by nonlinear contributions from @xmath0 itself .",
    "next we turn to the momentum constraints",
    ". these can be summarized by @xmath35 the three momentum constraint equations are obtained by reading this as a vector equation in orthonormal spherical coordinates . for a perfect fluid , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the physical velocity measured by an eulerian observer .",
    "equation ( [ momentumconstraints ] ) is the first challenge to the consistency of the use of the newtonplus metric : since the curl of any gradient vanishes , equation ( 10 ) will only have a solution if the fluid flow is such that @xmath38 .",
    "this condition is satisfied in spherical symmetry , but it typically will not be true when convection is present . for the use of the newtonplus metric to be meaningful ,",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "one is that the transverse ( or solenoidal ) portion of @xmath39 is small compared with the longitudinal ( or irrotational ) part , that is , @xmath40 ; this will obtain if , for example , radial flows dominate convective effects . in that case , @xmath39 is determined by the poisson equation @xmath41 the second possibility ",
    "the one we expect to follow in practice  is to neglect @xmath42 .",
    "this is reasonable in supernova environment : in contrast to the binary merger problem , one does not have entire stars moving at relativistic velocities . in the absence of bar or breakup instabilities",
    ", there is a quasispherical core , with asphericities due to rotation and convection .",
    "aside from secular changes due to viscosity , rotation alone can be considered relatively stationary , not contributing greatly to explicit time variation of @xmath0 .",
    "core convection may occur , but probably will involve nonrelativistic velocities",
    ". there may be relativistic radial infall velocities , as seen at late times in failed explosions @xcite , and also relativistic outflow velocities in jets @xcite ; but these situations involve matter at low density in comparison with the core .",
    "hence in the various phenomena occuring in the supernova environment there is reason to suppose that either the densities or velocities are such that @xmath43 is everywhere small enough for @xmath42 to be neglected altogether .",
    "heuristically , ignoring explicit time derivatives in determining @xmath0 based on this physical reasoning is consistent with the expectation that the back - reaction due to gravitational waves will not be dynamically important .",
    "next , we consider the evolution equations of @xmath22 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents a covariant derivative with respect to the 3-metric @xmath22 . for the newtonplus metric",
    ", the extrinsic curvature turns out to be @xmath46 referring back to eqs .",
    "( [ newtonplusmetric ] ) and ( [ admmetric ] ) , it is easy to see that the vanishing shift vector conspires with the explicit form of the extrinsic curvature tensor to make eq .",
    "( [ gammaevolution ] ) an identity leading to no new information .",
    "( this is the case even if we choose not to neglect @xmath47 . )",
    "finally , we come to the evolution equations for @xmath23 . in considering these equations we will take @xmath48 in accordance with the physical reasoning discussed in connection with the momentum constraints . from eq .",
    "( [ extrinsiccurvature ] ) , we see that our neglect of explicit time derivatives of @xmath0 implies a vanishing extrinsic curvature tensor .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution equations for @xmath23 provide nontrivial conditions , and will lead us to an equation for @xmath17 .",
    "various combinations of the einstein equations could be employed to give an equation for @xmath17 , and we have explored some of these in numerical computations of stationary rotating stars . because of numerical convergence issues discussed at the end of this section , our experience shows that convergence is achieved when the equation for @xmath17 is derived from a combination of the individual evolution equations for @xmath23 ; the `` lapse equation , '' which is the trace of the evolution equations for @xmath23 ; and the hamiltonian constraint .",

    "given the fact that we expect inconsistencies in the einstein equations due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom that we keep , it seems likely that eqs .",
    "( [ krr])-([kpp ] ) for @xmath17 are inconsistent , though it is not obvious ( to us ) how to prove this rigorously .",
    "however , we note that stresses ( e.g. , pressure ) constitute the primary source terms in the equations determining @xmath17 , confirming the expectation expressed previously , that @xmath17 should vanish as the newtonian limit is approached .",
    "the observation that @xmath17 will only be appreciable at the highest densities , where pressure begins to make a nontrivial contribution in comparison with energy density , suggests a reasonable path forward . in typical cases",
    "it is expected that the deepest portion of the core will be roughly spherical , even if rapid rotation causes an equatorial bulge of lower density material ( e.g. , fig . 2 of ref .",

    "( b)-(f ) , the efficacy of the newtonplus approximations can be judged by choosing a value of angular velocity and seeing how close the approximate quantities come to the fully relativistic value . while the `` full @xmath17 '' approximation is indistinguishable from full relativity in the spherical case , the two curves representing these treatments deviate from one another with increasing angular velocity . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , the `` overshoot '' of the `` linear @xmath17 '' approximation , discussed in connection with panel ( a ) , is again visible at low angular velocities . at the highest angular velocities , the `` linear @xmath17 '' approximation actually appears to give slightly better results than the `` full @xmath17 '' calculations , but it must be remembered that this is a lingering result of the `` overshoot '' at low angular velocities .",
    "as expected , the angular velocities at mass shedding of the newtonplus approximations are closer to the relativistic values than the newtonian case .",
    "the newtonplus treatments are quite successful at approximating the gravitational mass , radius , and eccentricity , while the success of the results for angular momentum and equatorial velocity is more modest .    the relative success of the newtonplus approximation in determining these observables can be understood by examining expressions for these quantities in the fully relativistic case .",
    "axisymmetric , stationary spacetimes can be described by four metric functions ; the metric can be expressed @xcite @xmath126 in comparison , the newtonplus metric is conformally flat ( equivalent to requiring @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ relativisticmetric ] ) ) , and lacks the shift vector component @xmath128 . in the relativistic case the angular momentum and equatorial velocity are given by @xmath129 in comparison with eqs .",
    "( [ angularmomentum ] ) and ( [ ueq ] ) , an important difference is that @xmath114 is replaced by @xmath130 . since values of @xmath128 can be a significant fraction of @xmath114 in extreme configurations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the neglect of this shift vector component in the newtonplus approximations probably accounts for most of the difference in @xmath131 and @xmath102 with the relativistic case . should play a significant role in the determination of physical quantities .",
    "however , other coordinate choices have been made in arriving at eq .",
    "( [ relativisticmetric ] ) , making the lapse and shift vector component quantities with physical content for which solutions must be found .",
    "specifically , two of the four degrees of coordinate freedom have been used to choose the time coordinate @xmath132 to label the spacelike hypersurfaces which are invariant under time translations , and the azimuthal coordinate @xmath125 to measure the angle about the axis of symmetry .",
    "once these two choices have been made , the metric components @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 vanish ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , which draws on @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining two degrees of coordinate freedom have been used to set @xmath137 and @xmath138 . ] the gravitational and baryon mass in the relativistic case are given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 , and the proper equatorial radius is @xmath141 in eqs .",
    "( [ relativisticmb ] ) and ( [ relativisticr ] ) , @xmath128 does not appear at all , and it plays a minor role in eq .",
    "( [ relativisticm ] ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that the approximation of conformal flatness is known to work well for rapidly rotating stars @xcite , shows why the newtonplus approximation gives good results for the gravitional mass , baryon mass , and equatorial radius .",
    "accurate neutrino transport , 3d hydrodynamics , and relativity are all essential for realistic supernova simulations . given the constraints of current hardware , these can not all be treated simultaneously with the detail they deserve .",
    "we have therefore presented an approximation to full relativity ( or set of related approximations ) that captures important relativistic effects in the quasispherical supernova environment : nonlinearity creating a deeper potential well , and pressure and internal energy density being nontrivial sources of gravitation .",
    "this `` newtonplus '' approach to gravity has a tight conceptual link with the newtonian limit that yields certain advantageous features .",
    "the gravitational portion of multidimensional newtonian calculations involves only the solution of the poisson equation for the gravitational potential @xmath0 , and taking its gradient to find the gravitational force .",
    "the basic idea of our newtonplus approach is to promote the newtonian metric functions  which are linear in @xmath0to full exponentials .",
    "we also add a second metric function , @xmath17 , whose main source is pressure ; hence this metric function vanishes in the newtonian limit .",
    "the einstein equations yield a nonlinear poisson - type equation for a ( now glorified ) `` gravitational potential , '' whose solution in 3d can be obtained in a manner similar to what would be done in the newtonian limit .",
    "the inconsistencies in the einstein equations arising from the reduced number of degrees of freedom turn out to be relegated to the subdominant metric function @xmath17 ; they can be removed by ignoring angular variations in @xmath17 .",
    "this is expected to be successful in the supernova context because the region where @xmath17 makes the greatest difference is where pressure is significant in comparison with rest mass density . normally , this is the deepest portion of the collapsed core , which is roughly spherical even when the outer layers bulge at the equator due to rapid rotation .",
    "less useful .",
    "the newtonplus approximation with @xmath142 could still be employed in such ( probably exceptional ) cases , however . ]",
    "this strategy  allowing the main contribution to the gravitational field to be multidimensional and nonlinear , while allowing a spherical correction for the contribution of stresses  reproduces fairly well many of the physical characteristics of rapidly rotating ( stationary ) relativistic stars . in future dynamic calculations , we intend to ignore explicit time derivatives of @xmath0 that appear in the einstein equations , and we have given specific arguments for the validity of this approximation in the supernova environment .",
    "( this can be tested in the future by comparing the results of spherically symmetric collapse simulations using newtonplus gravity with similar fully relativistic computations . )",
    "importantly , the hydrodynamics equations in spherical symmetry obtained from the newtonplus metric are of the same form as those used in a popular newtonian hydrodynamics algorithm , providing the expectation that existing newtonian codes might be adapted fairly easily to the newtonplus approach .",
    "finally , we make a few comments on approximations to full relativity employed by mathews and wilson @xcite and by shibata , baumgarte , and shapiro @xcite in binary neutron star merger calculations . while to our knowledge",
    "these approaches have not been implemented in supernova simulations , they conceivably could be ; hence we offer a few comments by way of comparison .",
    "these approaches involve the use of a conformally flat metric , the imposition of a traceless extrinsic curvature tensor , and the neglect of explicit time derivatives of gravitational variables .",
    "some arguments in favor of these approximations are given in ref .",
    "these approximations are similar to ours in that both retain a reduced number of degrees of freedom ( they keep four , while we keep two ) , both assume conformal flatness , and both ignore explicit time derivatives of gravitational variables . an important difference between refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite is that the latter neglect certain nonlinear gravitational terms that do not arise in the limit of spherical symmetry .",
    "we would argue that an advantage of our approach is the conceptual link with the newtonian limit . in the quasispherical supernova context this makes for only one dominant metric function ",
    "the glorified `` gravitational potential''while in the other approaches both the conformal factor and the lapse function are significant and must be solved for in multidimensions .",
    "they retain the entire shift vector ; we have suggested dropping it altogether , though our work shows that this causes errors in the angular momentum and equatorial velocities . in the context of assumed conformal flatness , wilson and",
    "mathews also found that proper treatment of the shift vector was critical to accurate treatment of the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "while angular momentum is perhaps less critical in supernovae than in binary mergers , it is known that the assumption of conformal flatness alone ( while retaining an azimuthal shift vector component ) yields accurate results for rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "this suggests a future extension to the work presented here that would improve results for angular momentum and equatorial velocity .",
    "the azimuthal shift vector component @xmath128 obeys an elliptic equation , whose solution can be written as a green s function expansion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit formula ) . like the solution of eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) for @xmath17 , obtaining the leading term of @xmath128 would involve only a pair of angular and radial integrations over the spacetime , but it would likely improve results for angular momentum and equatorial velocity significantly .",
    "this appendix shows the relationship between the newtonplus metric in the static limit and the ( interior ) schwarzschild metric .",
    "we point out that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium derived with the newtonplus metric is equivalent to the familiar tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation , as expected if the newtonplus metric provides an exact solution in spherical symmetry .",
    "the connection to the schwarzschild metric also allows greater insight into the behavior of the `` vanishing @xmath17 '' and `` linear @xmath17 '' approximations in the static limit .",
    "the schwarzschild line element is given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath93 are functions of @xmath145 .",
    "comparing with a static version of eq .",
