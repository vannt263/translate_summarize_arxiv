    "the problem of ion interactions in condensed matter continues to be the subject of intense experimental and theoretical research .",
    "these interactions are relevant to understand , among others , the behavior of static impurities in metals , such as the resistivity of impurities and metallic solutions @xcite , or the stopping of ions in solids @xcite .",
    "the screening of the intruder ion in the host medium plays a key role in these phenomena .",
    "a number of approaches , both perturbative and non - perturbative , have been devised over the years to describe the basic processes of ion - solid interactions . in particular , following the pioneering works of lindhard @xcite , and lindhard and winther @xcite , many calculations have been done within the framework of linear - response theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which enables a unified description of dynamical screening , plasmon excitation , and creation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "most of these calculations are based on the dielectric function in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which is valid in the weak - coupling ( i.e. , high - density ) limit of a degenerate electron gas ( deg ) .",
    "the main shortcoming of linear - response theory is observed in the low - velocity limit since the interaction effects become too strong to be properly accounted for by perturbative approximations @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative ( i.e. , non - linear ) methods also provide a reasonable description of ion - solid interactions . for instance , the kinetic theory @xcite involves the transport cross section for dynamically - screened interactions including quantum effects in the whole velocity range .",
    "however , though non - perturbative in the ion - solid coupling , the formalism does not include contributions from collective ( plasmon ) excitations to the stopping power , which are important in the high - velocity regime when the interaction potential becomes highly anisotropic .",
    "these quantum - mechanical models were initially proposed for the case of slow ions . in  @xcite a transport cross section approach based on the partial - wave expansion",
    "was introduced to calculate the stopping power of positive ions in channeling conditions , explaining qualitatively the observed oscillatory behavior of this quantity with the ion atomic number @xmath0 ( `` @xmath0 oscillations '' ) .",
    "a more rigorous many - body representation of the non - linear screening and stopping processes in a homogeneous deg was subsequently given in @xcite working within density - functional theory .",
    "a computationally convenient simplification is achieved if the numerical density - functional - theory potential is substituted by an analytical electron - ion interaction potential with a free parameter that is adjusted self - consistently requiring that the scattering phase shifts satisfy the friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "it is possible to introduce in the analytical potential more parameters , which are adjusted demanding the fulfillment of additional constraints like kato s cusp condition in the self - consistent procedure @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned non - linear approaches can be adapted immediately to deal with inhomogeneous degs having recourse to the local - plasma approximation ; this allows a realistic description of the screening and energy loss of low - energy ions in the spatially - varying electron densities encountered in solids @xcite .",
    "the problem of extending the quantum treatments to finite velocities has been addressed more recently in the context of density - functional theory @xcite and by means of model potentials with and without the born approximation @xcite .",
    "for instance , extensions of the friedel sum rule to finite velocities have been formulated either making use of the first - order born ( b1 ) approximation  @xcite or including all orders in the interaction strength  @xcite . in these formalisms the dynamical potential is replaced by a spherically symmetric one which facilitates the application of the conventional partial - wave analysis of one - electron scattering phase shifts . in the present article we too rely on this assumption .",
    "this work concerns itself with the perturbative treatment of screening effects in the case of static or slow ions in a deg .",
    "the b1 approximation yields a screening parameter that is independent of the ion atomic number @xmath0 and hence is the same for slow particles and antiparticles @xcite .",
    "this situation is somewhat unsatisfactory in analyzing the available experimental data on proton and antiproton energy losses in various solids @xcite .",
    "recently , using the friedel sum rule the screening lengths within the second - order born ( b2 ) approximation have been deduced in  @xcite for the yukawa and mensing interaction potentials . these b2 screening",
    "lengths pertaining to protons and antiprotons agree satisfactorily with the exact numerical solutions at electron densities typical of metals .",
    "however , in  @xcite only some simplified expressions of the screening lengths were studied and further investigation on this topic seemed desirable . to carry out this idea",
    "we evaluate the scattering amplitude and phase shifts within the b2 approximation and for an arbitrary interaction potential , which allows us to formulate explicitly the friedel sum rule at the same level of the b2 approximation .",
    "the scattering phase shifts are derived within the b2 approximation in section  [ sec:2 ] for an arbitrary spherically - symmetric interaction potential . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we employ these results to derive the second - order friedel sum rule .",
    "based on this sum rule we have developed a simple but general equation that determines the screening length , within the b2 approximation , for arbitrary screened potentials .",
    "moreover , this equation has been specified for the yukawa , hydrogenic , hulthn , and mensing potentials .",
    "the perturbative results for these potentials are compared , in section  [ sec:4 ] , with the corresponding exact solutions calculated from the friedel sum rule in a wide range of deg densities and for several charges of the impurity ion .",
    "finally , the pad approximant for the obtained born series in the friedel sum rule has also been examined .",
    "some details of the analytical calculations are included in appendices  a , b , and c.",
    "in this section we deduce , within the born approximation , the b1 and b2 scattering phase shifts using the systematic perturbative expansion of the exact scattering amplitude and the exact electronic wave function at the final state ( after scattering ) . although the b1 and b2 phase shifts are well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we suggest an alternative derivation of these quantities which is more suitable for the evaluation of the perturbative screening parameters in section  [ sec:3 ] . the starting point is the exact relation between the scattering amplitude @xmath2 for the elastic scattering and the phase shifts @xmath3 which is given by @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the electron wave number , @xmath6 is the scattering angle , and @xmath7 are the legendre polynomials . within the born approximation",
    "we assume that the @xmath8-th order phase shifts are determined by @xmath9 with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the born `` smallness parameter '' which should be precisely determined for each interaction potential .",
    "it is clear that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the isotropic ( i.e. , spherically symmetric ) interaction potential of the colliding particles . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the b2 approximation and look for the phase shifts in a perturbative manner @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the first- and second - order phase shifts , respectively .",
    "analogously , the scattering amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_exact ] ) can be written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the first- and second - order amplitudes , respectively .",
    "next , using the perturbative expansion of the phase shift we rewrite the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_exact ] ) in the form @xmath20 .",
    "then , keeping only terms up to the second order we have @xmath21 note that the imaginary part of @xmath22 vanishes while the imaginary part of the b2 scattering amplitude at @xmath23 ( forward scattering ) satisfies the optical theorem @xmath24=(k/4\\pi)\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot , b}1}(k)$ ] @xcite within the b2 approximation , where @xmath25 is the b1 total elastic cross section .    to determine the first- and second - order phase shifts , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_b1_a ] ) and ( [ eq : f_b2_a ] ) should be compared with the corresponding scattering amplitudes extracted from the systematic perturbative expansion of the exact electronic wave function at the final state ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is straightforward and leads to @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the initial and final wave vectors of the electron , respectively .",
    "let us recall that we assume here an elastic scattering process with momentum conservation , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "also @xmath30 is the unperturbed electronic wave function corresponding to the wave vector @xmath31 .",

    "note that @xmath35 is spherically symmetric in momentum space and is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the spherical bessel functions of the first kind and order @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : f_b1_c ] ) can be developed further if in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_fourier ] ) we replace @xmath40 with ( see eq .",

    "comparing now the real parts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ eq : f_b2_a ] ) we finally get ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath51    it is easy to verify that the imaginary parts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ eq : f_b2_a ] ) are identical because of the relation ( [ eq:10 ] ) for the b1 phase shifts .",
    "equations ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) thus represent the first- and second - order phase shifts , respectively .",
    "as expected , they are proportional to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) are valid when @xmath54 , which in particular is satisfied at high velocities ( large @xmath5 ) or in the case of a weak interaction potential . in addition",
    ", the validity of the born approximation requires that @xmath55 , which in general is fulfilled at high velocities . at small velocities ( small @xmath5 ) using the asymptotic behavior of the spherical bessel functions",
    "@xcite it is not difficult to show that the b1 and b2 phase shifts of eqs .",

    "therefore , at @xmath60 systematically @xmath55 for all @xmath38 , while at @xmath61 the requirement of the born approximation is satisfied at large angular momentum @xmath38 .",
    "we would like to close this section with the following remark .",
    "an alternative , shorter way to derive the first- and second - order phase shifts within the born approximation starts from the calogero equation @xcite @xmath62^{2 } \\label{eq : calogero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the generalized ( coordinate dependent ) phase shifts @xmath63 .",
    "the scattering phase shifts @xmath64 are then deduced according to the limit @xmath65 .",

    "( [ eq : fsr_exact ] ) below ) .",
    "let us look for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : calogero ] ) in a perturbative manner . within the b1 and b2 approximations",
    "the generalized phase shifts are denoted as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : calogero ] ) it is straightforward to see that @xmath68 and @xmath69 taking the limit @xmath70 in  ( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:15 ] ) we recover eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) for the first - order phase shifts @xmath15 while eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) yields @xmath71 to prove the identity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) we write the latter in an equivalent form by changing the orders of the integrations . then , taking half of the sum of the obtained expression and eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) for the second - order phase shifts @xmath16 derived directly from the systematic perturbative expansion of the exact scattering amplitude .",
    "with the perturbative formalism presented in section  [ sec:2 ] , we now take up the main topic of this paper , namely to study the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) for a point - like static ( or slow ) ion in a deg of density @xmath72 within up to the b2 approximation .",
    "the fsr is very useful to adjust in a self - consistent way the electron - ion interaction potential and the related screening length .",
    "the born approximation has been used before in conjunction with the fsr , but only within the first order @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat unsatisfactory since the resulting ( first - order ) screening length is independent of @xmath0 and is therefore identical for particles and their antiparticles .",
    "going beyond the b1 approximation , and considering the b2 approximation , allows more physical insight and furnishes useful numerical estimates of the influence of the ion charge on the screening length in a deg . the problem is closely related to the formulation of the theory of the higher - order stopping power involving the barkas correction ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) which is @xmath73 and is not symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the usual treatment of the fsr for static ions @xcite .",
