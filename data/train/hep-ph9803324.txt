    "a caveat here is that this bound is for @xmath8 with couplings to vector bosons of @xmath3 strength , but if the vector boson ( @xmath10 ) coupling is very suppressed a relatively light @xmath8 may escape detection at lep1 and lep2 @xcite , @xcite .    throughout the paper we highlight the existence of a fermiophobic higgs ( @xmath11 ) @xcite@xmath12 @xcite which is possible in the models we consider .",

    "one can vary the angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 independently in order to find parameter spaces for extreme branching ratios ( brs ) .",
    "there are differences here from the lep2 scenario @xcite due to the rapid strengthening of the @xmath46 channel for @xmath9 gev , these decays being negligible at lep2 .",
    "in addition the lhc allows different production mechanisms which will be scaled by mixing angle factors .",
    "we note that the @xmath10 coupling in all 4 models is scaled relative to that of @xmath47 by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "at the lhc the dominant production process for @xmath3 is that of @xmath49 fusion , which proceeds via a top quark loop @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other production mechanisms are considerably smaller , with the next largest being @xmath50 fusion .",
    "vector boson fusion @xcite is always suppressed in a 2hdm by a factor @xmath51 , while @xmath49 fusion can be enhanced by up to a factor of two . if the @xmath49 fusion process is absent then the cross ",
    "section @xmath52 is heavily diminished , and this happens in the case of a fermiophobic higgs .",
    "the higgs bremsstrahlung off a @xmath53 quark is small for @xmath3 but in model ii and ii@xmath16 it can be boosted for large values of @xmath29 and may become the dominant production process .",
    "the most studied channels in the literature for detecting @xmath3 are @xcite , @xcite :    * @xmath54 for 80 gev@xmath55 gev . * @xmath56 for 130 gev@xmath57 gev .",
    "other channels are considered to give a lesser chance of detection , e.g. those which make use of @xmath58 decays are swamped by backgrounds . for the models that we shall consider there are four possible channels which could distinguish @xmath8 from @xmath3 :    * an enhanced signal in channels which exploit the decay @xmath59 . *",
    "an enhanced signal in the channel @xmath60 . * an enhanced signal in the channel @xmath61 or @xmath62 in the heavy higgs mass region .",
    "* an enhanced or suppressed signal in the channel @xmath63 .",
    "in the subsections that follow we shall see that some of the above signatures are exclusive to a particular 2hdm model , while others only suggest that a detected neutral higgs boson would be of a non  minimal nature .",
    "each of the above signatures will be examined in the context of @xmath64 collisions at @xmath65 tev and @xmath66 or @xmath67 fb@xmath68 .",
    "we shall focus on the four distinct versions of the 2hdm , remembering that @xmath8 from the mhdm can mimic any @xmath8 from the 2hdm . however , there are possible differences in the phenomenology of the 2hdm and mhdm .",
    "to illustrate this , we note here that once @xmath22 and @xmath23 have been chosen to obtain a distinctive br , the production cross ",
    "section is constrained and often suppressed compared to @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that if ( say ) large @xmath69 is required to enhance a particular partial width , any coupling proportional to @xmath70 will be automatically reduced ( see table  1 ) . in the mhdm",
    "this correlation among the couplings is relaxed , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the more complicated mixing matrices and the presence of more vevs .",
    "hence it is possible to have the same enhanced brs in the mhdm along with a larger production cross  section , resulting in more signal events overall .      for @xmath3",
    ", the decay to @xmath0 proceeds via charged particle loops ( see fig .  1 ) , i.e. fermions and @xmath71 bosons .",
    "we thus concentrate on the decay @xmath54 and look for ways of enhancing @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath3 the vector boson loops dominate and contribute with opposite sign to the fermion loops .",
    "one  loop corrections are small @xcite , and the tree ",
    "level width can be written as @xcite : @xmath72 is the colour factor , @xmath73 is the electric charge of the fermion , and the @xmath74 variables are defined by @xmath75    the above equations show that the dominant fermion loop is that of the @xmath76 quark ( i.e. @xmath77 ) .",
    "the amplitudes ( @xmath78 ) are real and vary from @xmath79 for @xmath80 , @xmath81 for @xmath80 .",
    "hence the @xmath71 loops are dominant . for the minimal sm higgs , br  @xmath82 for 80 gev @xmath55 gev . to increase this br for @xmath8 one",
    "would naively wish to enhance the width @xmath83 significantly , but this is not an option since :    * the @xmath71 loop contributes the most , and the @xmath84 vertex is suppressed relative to @xmath85 by a factor @xmath51 . *",
    "although it is possible to reduce the strength of the @xmath86 vertex and thus cause less destructive interference , this does not increase the width much , and the corresponding reduction in @xmath87 is disastrous from the point of view of the total cross  section .    a better way of increasing br  @xmath88 is to suppress other decay channels such as @xmath62 ( which dominates in the relevant mass region ) .",
    "this suppression can be achieved in models ii and ii@xmath16 for small @xmath70 although in model ii the above parameter choice suppresses @xmath62 and @xmath1 decays simultaneously , thus further enhancing br  @xmath88 . in the extreme case of br  @xmath89 ( @xmath90 )",
    ", one finds that enhancements of a factor two ( relative to @xmath3 ) are possible for br  @xmath91 ) .",
    "choices of @xmath29 close to 1 would cause a factor 2 increase for the the main production mechanism @xmath92 relative to that for @xmath3 .",
    "table  2 ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows the expected signal for @xmath3 for @xmath93=30 fb@xmath68 with the significance being rather low in the range 80 gev@xmath94 gev . for @xmath8 the enhancement of @xmath0 events by a factor up to 4 would provide",
    "a clear signature , and table  3 shows the signal numbers for model ii with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "a consequence of this is that although similar enhancements of br  @xmath88 are again possible , the production mechanism @xmath106 would be heavily suppressed .",
    "however , a chance of detection remains in the associated production channel @xmath107 with subsequent decays @xmath108 and @xmath59 .",
    "enhancing @xmath59 would require @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( i.e. @xmath23 at its smallest value ) , and hence @xmath111 ; thus the associated production cross  section would be suppressed relative to @xmath3 by a factor 0.5 .",
    "however , with the higher br(@xmath59 ) one would expect a comparable number of events , and since a reasonable statistical signal in the associated production channel is possible for @xmath3 with high luminosity , then an analogous signal for @xmath8 may be obtainable .",

    "@xmath100 + 80 & 13.5 & 10.5 & 4.2 + 110 & 18.3 & 7.0 & 6.9 +    the event numbers for @xmath3 include contributions from the associated process @xmath112 , @xmath54 , with the lepton trigger originating from @xmath113 .",
    "this contributes about @xmath114 of the signal in table  4 . for the above mentioned case of @xmath8 , the contribution in this channel would be negligible ( since the parameter choice for a larger br  ( @xmath59 ) requires suppression of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 coupling ) .",
    "therefore we would expect around half the number of events shown in table  4 , giving a small signal between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "hence a null search in the @xmath117 channel but a signal in the associated channel would then be evidence for model i@xmath16 .",
    "we recall that a fermiophobic higgs ( @xmath11 ) may have a sizeable br  @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
    "it too has no production channel @xmath119 , but would give a clear , distinct signal in the associated production channel for @xmath120 decays .",
    "it has a larger br  @xmath121 than is possible in model i@xmath16 , varying from @xmath122 for @xmath123 gev to @xmath124 for @xmath125 gev .",
    "the current bound on @xmath126 from the tevatron ( @xmath127 gev ) assumes @xmath3 strength couplings to vector bosons , which in general is not the case .",
    "hence an @xmath11 with a mass considerably less than 81 gev is not ruled out .",
    "2 and 3 show the statistical significance ( defined by @xmath128 ) for two different values of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath29(@xmath129 ) for the three @xmath11 considered in ref .",

    "to our knowledge there has not been a rigorous simulation for the associated production process for heavier higgs masses , but we may conclude that detection of @xmath11 will be very difficult in this channel for @xmath142 gev .      the next channel we wish to consider is @xmath60 . for the sm higgs in the mass region 100 gev @xmath143 gev this decay varies from br=@xmath144 to @xmath145 .",

    "as @xmath29 becomes very large one can obtain br@xmath151 for all the displayed values of @xmath22 , and thus all four curves will asymptote to a fixed value of @xmath4 .",
    "smaller @xmath22 is favourable from the point of view of the cross  section and this is why the curves with @xmath152 asymptote to larger values of @xmath4 than is possible for @xmath149 ; they take longer to reach the @xmath132 signal because the br to @xmath153 for smaller @xmath29 is inferior to the corresponding br with @xmath149 . since setting @xmath149 gives the best coverage we use this value in fig .  5 , which shows the expected signal for @xmath154 up to 300 gev .",
    "it is clear from the graphs that a good signal in this channel is possible even for relatively large values of @xmath154 .",
    "we note that the enhancement of the higgs bremsstralung off a @xmath53 quark at high @xmath29 is possible in model ii , while br  @xmath155 would approach @xmath156 in this limit . the combination of an enhanced production cross  section and a br(@xmath157 ) of order @xmath156 would also allow a large signal in the @xmath153 channel . with values of @xmath158 one could obtain a signal larger than is obtained for @xmath8 of model i@xmath16 using the same @xmath29 value",

    "the cross ",
    "section is roughly 10 times less for @xmath213 than for @xmath3 throughout the range 200 gev@xmath214 gev , and br  @xmath215 br  @xmath216 .",
    "we would find that a 4@xmath217 signal is only possible up to @xmath218(600 ) gev for @xmath219@xmath16 ) .",
    "for @xmath194 the cross ",
    "section is roughly half that of @xmath134 throughout the heavy mass region , but this is compensated by the fact that br(@xmath220 ) is twice that of @xmath134 , with the result being that a similar signal is expected .",
    "this analysis is for maximum values for production cross  sections .",
    "therefore it turns out that there is a sizeable parameter space ( @xmath135 , @xmath221 ) for a hidden @xmath11 at the lhc .",
    "we stress that the distinctive signature of a fermiophobic higgs ( @xmath120 ) is lost in this heavier mass region , and the suppressed @xmath160 signal could be mimicked by another @xmath8 with suppressed @xmath183 decays and/or production cross  section .",
    "we have studied the phenomenology of the lightest cp  even neutral higgs boson(@xmath8 ) of a non  susy , non  minimal standard model at the lhc .",
    "emphasis was given to the problem of distinguishing @xmath8 from the sm higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) and to the detection prospects of a fermiophobic higgs ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is complementary to our earlier work which considered prospects at lep2 .",
    "we considered four different decay channels and showed that the following signals are possible :    * an enhanced signal in the @xmath222 , @xmath223 channel would be evidence for model ii or ii@xmath16 , although model ii can produce the greater number of events .",
    "a signal in the associated production channel @xmath224 , @xmath223 and @xmath108 but no signal in the above channel would be evidence for model i@xmath16 or a fermiophobic higgs , with the latter capable of more signal events .",
    "* a large signal from @xmath60 decays is possible in model i@xmath16 , even for relatively large masses , and would be accompanied by a signature in the @xmath160 channel , unless the former has a branching ratio close to @xmath163 . in model",
    "ii it is possible to have a comparable enhancement of @xmath1 events but the accompanying decays would be to hadrons , the latter unlikely to be separated from the backgrounds .",
    "* enhanced @xmath61 , @xmath62 decays in the heavy higgs region are possible although they are very difficult to detect at the lhc due to the large jet background .",
    "detection may be possible in the @xmath86 channel if the theoretical error on the background @xmath225 cross  section can be reduced to below @xmath176 .",
    "* a suppressed or enhanced signal in the @xmath160 channel would indicate a non  minimal higgs sector , although would not shed light on which model were actually present .",
    "+ detection of a fermiophobic higgs will be difficult for masses greater than 130 gev , the only chance being a suppressed signal in the @xmath160 channel .",
    "such a suppression , however , may be mimicked in all the models considered and so is not indicative of fermiophobia . the unmistakable signature of @xmath11 is available up to @xmath226 gev , and would be a spectacular excess of @xmath0 events in the associated production channel provided that the cross - section is not so suppressed .",
