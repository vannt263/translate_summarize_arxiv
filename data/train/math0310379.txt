    "@xmath3 is a graph on @xmath4 nodes containing a single cycle through all nodes .",
    "we now give the definitions of our classes .    class 1 : :    let @xmath5 , the @xmath4-cycle    graph .",
    "we obtain @xmath6 by superimposing the line    graph @xmath7 onto the graph    @xmath8 , that is splitting each edge of    @xmath8 with the corresponding vertex of    @xmath7 and then adding the edges of    @xmath7 .",

    "clearly , all but @xmath14 of the    @xmath15 nodes of @xmath16 have degree    4 , and we say that @xmath16 is an _ almost _",

    "for example , in figure  [ fig1 ] , the extra    edges are the dashed edges , and by adding them we get the graphs    @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "so , to get    @xmath17 we add @xmath4 additional edges to    @xmath16 , and it is easy to see that    @xmath17 is a 4-regular graph .",
    "class 3 : :    let @xmath20 , a complete graph on    @xmath21 nodes . put the @xmath4 nodes of    @xmath22 on a circle and draw the remaining    @xmath23 edges .",
    "call the first @xmath4    edges _ external _ and the remaining edges , _",
    "internal_. then    construction of @xmath24 is similar to that of    @xmath16 , except that :    +    1 .",
    "the basis of the construction is now @xmath25 ,    rather than @xmath3 .    2 .   on each iteration @xmath26 ,",
    "the graph superimposed onto    @xmath27 is not @xmath28 but    rather the complete graph on the nodes of @xmath29 ,    the line graph of @xmath3 formed by the external edges    of @xmath22 .",
    "+    in figure  [ fig2 ] , we show how to construct @xmath30 from    @xmath31 ( the dashed edges should be ignored ) . in that    figure ,",
    "the external edges of respective complete graphs are in bold .",
    "we also remark that the internal edges do not intersect each other .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig2 ] suggests a convenient way of representing    @xmath30 , where each node of the graph lies only on    internal edges incident with that node .",
    "we achieve that by putting the    nodes of the line graphs under consideration off the centers of the    corresponding edges . indeed ,",
    "if we were using the centers of the    external edges , @xmath30 would look as in figure  [ fig3 ] ,    which is misleading since , for example , the node @xmath32 does    not lie on the edge @xmath33 .",
    "+    the graph @xmath24 is almost    @xmath34-regular , since all but @xmath4 of    its @xmath35 nodes have degree @xmath36 .",

    "for example , in figure  [ fig2 ] , the    extra edges are the dashed edges , and by adding them we construct the    graph @xmath40 from @xmath30 .",
    "so to get    @xmath38 we add @xmath4 extra edges to    @xmath24 , and it is easy to see that    @xmath38 is an @xmath34-regular graph .",
    "= 100.0pt    let @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the number of independent sets in the graphs @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath24 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "in our paper we study these numbers . in section  [ section_3 ] ,",
    "we give an algorithm for calculating all these numbers .",
    "for the numbers @xmath44 , we provide an explicit generating function ( see theorem  [ propp ] ) .",
    "however , in order to illustrate our approach to the problem , in section  [ section_2 ] we consider @xmath45 and find an explicit formula for it .",
    "our choice of the graphs to study was motivated by the so called _ de bruijn graphs _ , which are defined as follows .",
    "a de bruijn graph is a directed graph @xmath46 , where the set of vertices @xmath47 is the set of all the words of length @xmath14 in a finite alphabet @xmath48 , and there is an arc from @xmath49 to @xmath50 if    @xmath51 , @xmath52 ,    that is when the words @xmath53 and @xmath54 overlap by @xmath55 letters .",
    "the de bruijn graphs were first introduced ( for the alphabet @xmath56 ) by de bruijn in 1944 for enumerating the number of code cycles .",
    "however , these graphs proved to be a useful tool for various problems related to the subject of combinatorics on words ( e.g. see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that the graph @xmath57 can be defined recursively as @xmath58 .",
    "the authors were interested in studying other graphs defined recursively using the operation of taking line graphs ( with natural bases ) , which could give interesting applications .",
    "also , with our choice of graphs ( @xmath16 and @xmath24 ) , it is natural to complete them to regular graphs ( @xmath17 and @xmath38 ) and study these graphs .",
    "it turns out that there are combinatorial interpretations ( relations to other combinatorial objects ) for the number of independent sets for some of our graphs , and we mention these relations in sections  [ section_2 ] and  [ section_3 ] .",
    "moreover , we construct a direct bijection describing such a relation for @xmath59 ( see proposition  [ psets ] and the discussion that follows ) .",
    "let us first find an explicit formula for @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that for any independent set of the graph @xmath60 , we can label a node of @xmath60 1 if this node is in the independent set , and label it 0 otherwise .",
    "thus , our purpose is to count the number of triangles having either 0 or 1 in each node and such that no two adjacent nodes are both assigned 1s .",
    "we call such triangles _ legal_.    in order to get a recursion for @xmath45 , we introduce three auxiliary parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , which are the numbers of legal triangles that , up to rotation , have specific numbers in the nodes of the biggest triangle ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "since we consider only legal graphs , the 1s in the nodes of the biggest triangle induces 0s in certain nodes of a smaller triangle ( this 0s are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "= 300.0pt    considering all the possibilities for the numbers of the biggest triangle , we have that @xmath64 where @xmath65 corresponds to all 0s , and we have multiple 3 two times because of possible rotations .",
    "similarly , we get that @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to the recursion @xmath68 which , under the same initial conditions , is equivalent to the recursion @xmath69 we define @xmath70 , since we associate the graph @xmath71 with the empty graph , in which case there is only one independent set , the empty set .",
    "thus , @xmath72 and the generating function for the numbers @xmath45 is @xmath73 .",
    "the initial values for the numbers @xmath45 are : @xmath74    preceded by 0 , the sequence @xmath75 is the binomial transform of the pell numbers @xmath76 ( see ( * ? ? ? * a007070 ) ) .",
    "these numbers can also be interpreted as maximum bets in a poker game ( also see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "a007070 ) ) , where the first player bets 1 dollar into a pot and the @xmath26th player bets the amount of the @xmath77st player s bet plus the resulting amount of money in the pot .",
    "then the number of dollars @xmath78 in the pot after @xmath14 bets is given by @xmath79 which yields @xmath80 .",
    "we remark that it would be interesting to obtain recurrence ( [ equa2 ] ) directly from the graph @xmath81 , rather than via recurrence ( [ equa1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to do this .",
    "in this section we present an algorithm for calculating @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 by using the transfer matrix method ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  4.7.2 ) ) .        similarly to section  [ section_2 ] , for any independent set of the graph @xmath82 , consider a labeling of @xmath82 , where the nodes of of the independent set are labeled @xmath83 and the remaining nodes are labeled 0 . for a given graph @xmath82 , we define the _ @xmath14-th level _ of @xmath82 to be @xmath84 , which is isomorphic to @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we may think of an independent set of the graph @xmath82 as assembled from elements chosen on each level , making sure that when we add a new level , we create no conflict with the previous level .",
    "the collection @xmath86 of possible level labelings is the set of all @xmath87 @xmath4-vectors @xmath88",
    ". it will be convenient to define @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath88 and @xmath90 in @xmath86 are a possible consecutive pair of levels in an independent set of @xmath82 ( with @xmath91 following @xmath92 ) if and only if @xmath93 thus , to obtain any independent set in the graph @xmath82 , we begin with a vector of @xmath86 , then keep adjoining each next vector @xmath94 so that it satisfies  ( [ eqgg ] ) together with the previously chosen vector @xmath95 , until @xmath14 vectors have been selected .",
    "we define a matrix @xmath96 , the transfer matrix of the problem , as follows .",
    "@xmath1 is a @xmath97 matrix of @xmath98s and @xmath83s whose rows and columns are indexed by vectors of @xmath86 .",
    "the entry of @xmath1 in position @xmath99 is @xmath83 if the ordered pair of vectors @xmath99 satisfies  ( [ eqgg ] ) , and is @xmath98 otherwise .",
    "@xmath1 depends only on @xmath4 , not on @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the number of independent sets of @xmath82 , @xmath41 , is the first entry of the vector @xmath100 , where @xmath101 if there are the @xmath26th vector @xmath92 in the collection @xmath86 has no two consecutive @xmath83s , even after wrapping , ( i.e. @xmath102 for all @xmath103 ) , and @xmath104 otherwise .",
    "hence , @xmath105 for instance , when @xmath106 , the possible level vectors are @xmath107 except for the last level , where we only have @xmath108 if we index the rows and the columns of the transfer matrix @xmath1 in this order , then we get @xmath109    the vector @xmath110 in this case is @xmath111 .",
    "if we now find the first entry of the vector @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the unit matrix , then we get that the generating function for @xmath45 is given by @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain the results for larger @xmath4 similarly .",
    "the collection of possible levels @xmath86 is the set of all @xmath4-vectors @xmath92 of @xmath98s and @xmath83s such that there no consecutive @xmath83s in @xmath92 , that is , @xmath122 ( where we define @xmath89 ) .",

    ", we begin with a vector of @xmath86 , then keep adjoining each next vector @xmath94 so that it satisfies  ( [ eqgg ] ) together with the previously chosen vector @xmath95 , until @xmath14 vectors have been selected .",
