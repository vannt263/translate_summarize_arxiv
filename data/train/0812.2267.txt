    "these configurations are consistent with `` bonnor - ebert spheres '' @xcite , which are non - singular solutions to the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium confined by an external pressure . in the 1d isothermal approximation",
    ", there is a family of bonnor - ebert solutions parametrized by the central density @xmath12 , where the density profile is characterized by two regimes : a slow decrease in the density for small radii , and a faster decrease , of power - law type ( @xmath13 ) , for larger radii .",
    "detailed modelling of profiles in the infrared @xcite and continuum emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , we can approximate the intrinsic color of each on - cloud star by the average color of the control field , and the color excess is :    @xmath31    using equation  [ eq : excess ] , we calculate the color excess for each star in the globule region .",

    "the choice of the smoothing parameter @xmath41 is a compromise between a final map with high signal - to - noise ratio and low spatial resolution , or a noisy map with high resolution @xcite . to construct the extinction map of b68 ( and all the globules in this work ) we choose @xmath41 = 20@xmath28",
    "nonetheless , other values were tested : with @xmath41 = 10@xmath28 the map is very noisy , and with @xmath41 = 30@xmath28 the map loses details .",
    "therefore , a choice of @xmath41 = 20@xmath28 provides the best spatial resolution for a signal - to - noise ratio between 8 and 12 in the central region of b68 .",
    "figure [ fig : b68 ] shows the visual extinction map for b68 constructed using data from the 2mass catalog . comparing with the map of @xcite , we see a good correspondence between them , taking into account that the 2mass used a 1.3 meters telescope , while @xcite used a 3.5 meters telescope and longer integration times .",
    "the sensitivity difference between these telescopes is certainly responsible for the different values of extinction found in the center of b68 . from the 2mass data ,",
    "we obtain a maximum extinction of 24 magnitudes , while @xcite and @xcite , using the same data set , derived 30 magnitudes .",
    "this result shows that the extinctions derived toward the center of the globules in our sample , as well as the density contrast , have to be seen as lower limits . in despite of getting a lower extinction peak , the extinction distribution and the peak position are coincident .",

    "in order to test if the 2mass data together with the nice method can produce reliable dust extinction maps of bok globules , we also constructed maps using the traditional star counts method .",

    "this is probably because the distribution of the stars in the k band is almost uniform in the most opaque region of b68 .",
    "the h and j band maps show b68 as a region of extent @xmath10 3 - 4 pixels without any details on the distribution of dust extinction in the core .",
    "it is important to note that a non uniforme distribution of field stars causes unrealistic peaks of high visual extinction , which are not seen in the dss red plates .",
    "the same situation occurs for bhr 059 .",

    "the signal - to - noise ratio for the maps constructed through the nice method is always greater than 3 in the most extincted regions where we constructed the radial extinction profiles . even though the signal - to - noise ratio is not as good for the more diffuse , low extinction regions , it is not crucial for our purposes , because we are interested in the profile of the core embedded in the globule to finally model it with a bonnor - ebert sphere .",
