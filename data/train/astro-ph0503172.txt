    "giant arcs are formed when background galaxies are distorted into long arc - like shapes by the gravitational shear of intervening clusters of galaxies .",
    "they are among the most beautiful images on the sky ( e.g. , see the hubble space telescope [ hst ] images of a2218 , kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) . as clusters of galaxies are the largest bound structures in the universe , they are at the tail of the mass function of bound structures .",
    "the formation of giant arcs therefore critically depends on the abundance and density profiles of clusters .",
    "observationally , the number of giant arcs was first estimated using the einstein medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ) by gioia & luppino ( 1994 ) .",
    "the largest dedicated search for giant arcs in x - ray clusters was performed by luppino et al .",

    "all these recent studies show that giant arcs are quite common in clusters of galaxies .",
    "earlier predictions of giant arcs use simple spherical models ( e.g. , wu & hammer 1993 ) . however , such models are clearly inadequate , as the ellipticities and substructures of clusters can enhance the lensing cross - section by a large factor ( bartelmann & weiss 1994 ; bartelmann , steinmetz & weiss 1995 ) .",

    "wambsganss et al . (",
    "2004 ) pointed out the simple fact that the probability of high lensing magnifications is very sensitive to the assumed source redshift .",

    "as the redshift distribution for the background source population that forms arcs is not well known , this introduces an uncertainty in the comparison between observations and predictions .    in this paper , we use high - resolution simulations to re - examine the predicted number of giant arcs and compare our predictions with observations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we discuss the numerical simulations we use and the method we employ to identify giant arcs in simulated clusters . in  3 , we present the main results of the paper and compare them with several previous studies ( bartelmann et al . 1998 ; wambsganss et al .",

    "if the particle number within the kernel is fewer than 64 , then we double the kernel size until the particle number is larger than 64 .",
    "however , for the high density regions , when the particle number is larger than 400 within the kernel , we only use the nearest 400 particles to estimate the density . in order to obtain the lensing potential , we also use a larger grid ( @xmath52 ) centered on the smaller grid ; the surface densities are padded with zeros for all the pixels outside the inner grid .",
    "the lensing potential is then obtained using the fft method ( b98 ) .",
    "notice that the larger grid is used to avoid aliasing problems due to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "to perform efficient lensing simulations , we first identify regions of interest in the lens plane that have magnifications exceeding @xmath53 and regions with @xmath54 ; other regions are unlikely to produce giant arcs with @xmath5 exceeding 7.5 .",

    "we use the newton - raphson method to find the image position and its corresponding magnification and eigenvalues .",
    "when there are multiple images , following w04 , we use only the image with the largest ( absolute ) magnification . in the following , we will study the validity of two approximate measures of @xmath5 , namely the magnification , @xmath48 , and the ratio of the two eigenvalues , @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : dtaudz ] , for sources above redshift 3 , most lensing cross - sections are due to lenses below redshift 2.4 , and there are wiggles in the optical depth curves .",

    "as mentioned above , another key difference between our study and w04 is how the @xmath5 ratio is measured : w04 assume the @xmath5 ratio to equal the magnification , while we measure the @xmath5 ratio through ellipse - fitting .",
    "w04 effectively assumed infinitesimally small circular sources , while we assume the sources to be elliptical and to have a finite size .",
    "we will examine below how these different assumptions affect our predictions .",

    "the finite source size effect may be important , particularly for low - mass clusters whose caustics are small .",
    "ferguson et al . ( 2004 ) recently used the hst to study the size evolution of galaxies as a function of redshift .",

    "the size becomes smaller as the source redshift increases .",
    "the distributions are similar for sources above redshift 2.3 , with a peak around @xmath4 and range from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "our adopted size falls within the range for galaxies from redshift 1.4 to 5 . as the redshift of giant arcs spans a wide range ( from 0.4 to 5.6 , see table 1 in w04 ) , it is important to examine how our results change if we adopt difference source sizes .",
    "[ fig : sourcesize ] shows the cumulative cross - section as a function of cluster mass for four source diameters , from @xmath143 , 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 arc seconds respectively . in this exercise ,",
    "we have taken the source population to be at redshift 1.0 , and the clusters are at redshift 0.3 , i.e. approximately at the optimal cluster lensing redshift for @xmath6 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dtaudz ] ) .",
    "the cumulative cross - sections are calculated down to @xmath144 , below which clusters do not contribute substantial cross - sections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mlens ] ) . for giant arcs with @xmath13 , the cross - section increases by about 50% when the source diameter changes from @xmath1 to @xmath145 . for giant arcs with @xmath146 and @xmath147 ,",
    "as expected , the finite source effects are even more modest .",
    "the optical depths for @xmath148 are shown as functions of the source redshift in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] . the optical depth increases by about 50% as @xmath149 decreases from @xmath1 to @xmath4 .",
    "the finite source size effect appears modest , insufficient to explain our discrepancy with w04 .",
    "notice that @xmath150 agrees well with @xmath151 for nearly all source redshifts .",
    "furthermore , notice that as the source size decreases from @xmath1 to @xmath4 , the optical depth does not follow @xmath151 any more closely , as one might expect .",
    "this arises because , following w04 , we have used only the brightest of multiple images for @xmath75 . in contrast , when calculating @xmath152 , @xmath153 and so on , the cross - section has been multiplied by the number of giant arcs that satisfy the selection criteria ( a similar procedure was used by b98 ) .",
    "so in general , even when the source size decreases to zero , these two cross - sections do not overlap with each other .",
    "another difference between our study and w04 is that we use elliptical sources while w04 use ( infinitesimally small ) circular sources .",
    "the ellipticity distribution we adopt ( uniform between 0 to 0.5 ) is in good agreement with the study of ferguson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found a flat distribution between 0.1 to 0.6 ( with a small drop in the number of galaxies with zero ellipticity ) . nevertheless , we want to check how the ellipticity changes the results .",
    "[ fig : ellipticity ] shows the ratio of the cumulative cross - sections as a function of cluster mass for elliptical sources and circular sources for giant arcs with @xmath5 larger than 5 , 7.5 and 10 .",
    "again all the clusters are at redshift 0.3 and the sources are placed at redshift 1 . in all cases ,",
    "the ellipticity increases the cross - section by 20% to 55% , implying that if we adopted circular sources , the discrepancy with w04 will become slightly worse .",
    "notice that the rate of increase depends both on the source size and the @xmath5 ratio , but the dependence is not monotonic due to the competing effects of finite source size and ellipticity , as was also found by oguri ( 2002 ) . in summary ,",
    "the finite source size and ellipticity of sources both have only modest effects on the optical depth of giant arcs , insufficient to explain the difference between our study and w04 .",
    "as we mentioned above , we reproduce the optical depth of w04 if we approximate the @xmath5 by magnification . however , rigorous ellipse - fitting of simulated images reduce the optical depth by a factor of @xmath9 10 .",
    "this means only @xmath154 or so of the images with @xmath11 form giant arcs with @xmath13 .",
    "the question thus naturally arises : why do the rest 90% of images fail to make giant arcs @xmath13 ?",
    "first , it is well - known that for isothermal spheres ( @xmath155 ) , the @xmath5 ratio is identical to the magnification .",
    "but clusters are not isothermal spheres .",
    "as we have illustrated using a generalized nfw profile ( a better approximation for clusters ) in  [ sec : caustics ] , the magnification is no longer equal to the @xmath5 ratio .",
    "second , the top right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:4p ] clearly shows that , for this cluster , most giant arcs form at the position of the cusps while few giant arcs are formed near fold sections of caustics ( which contribute most of the high magnification images ) in the source plane",
    ". images with high magnification and low distortion must thus be along caustics but away from cusps .",
    "this is also expected from catastrophe theory , because images with high magnifications and low distortions are formed near the so - called `` lips '' or `` beak - to - beak '' caustics ( cf .",
    "schneider et al .  1992 ) .",
    "however , the question still remains : what are the image configurations of the rest of the highly magnified images ?",
    "[ fig : fraction ] provides the answer .",
    "it shows that roughly 50% and 80% of the highly magnified images with magnification above 10 form arcs with @xmath147 and @xmath156 respectively ; here the magnification is determined by the ratio of the image area and the source area .",
    "the remaining 20% or so images are highly magnified but ( largely ) undistorted ( hmus ) .",
    "williams & lewis ( 1998 ) studied such images for cored isothermal and nfw density profiles .",
    "they found that for isothermal cored clusters , the ratio between hmus and giant arcs with @xmath13 is of the order of unity . for nfw profiles ,",
    "the ratio is only about 30% .",
    "our corresponding ratio is about @xmath16 and lower for smaller sources .",
    "notice that there are comparable number of images with @xmath13 and @xmath157 .",
    "this will further decrease the relative number of hmus relative to the observed number of giant arcs with @xmath13 .",
    "we do not regard this as a serious discrepancy , as williams & lewis ( 1998 ) used spherically symmetric clusters as lenses .",
    "cluster lenses forming large arcs are preferentially merging and highly irregular , so the effect of shear due to substructures may be much more important than that in their studies , which can plausibly explain the differences in the ratio of giant arcs and hmus .    a related question concerns the width of giant arcs , which provides valuable information about the inner density profile of clusters .",
    "to see the general trend , we use a spherically symmetric toy model for clusters , where the density is a power - law as a function of radius , @xmath158 . for an isothermal sphere , @xmath159 , and",
    "the inner slope of an nfw profile is @xmath160 . for an infinitesimally small circular source , when @xmath161 , the width of a tangential arc is equal to @xmath162 times the diameter of the ( circular ) source . for an isothermal sphere , lensing conserves the source width .",
    "a point lens corresponds to the limit @xmath163 , in this case the width is equal to one half of the source diameter . in reality , clusters are not spherically symmetric , nevertheless , the width and length of giant arcs carry valuable information about the central density profiles in clusters ( hammer 1991 ; miralda - escud 1993 ) . fig . [",
    "fig : widthlw ] shows the distribution of widths of giant arcs with @xmath146 . for @xmath164 , the distribution peaks around @xmath140 , and rapidly drops off at @xmath142 . for @xmath165 , the distribution peaks around @xmath166 and drops off rapidly around @xmath1 , except for the tenth most massive cluster which seems to have a much broader distribution",
    "this is because this cluster has the smallest caustics , and the finite source size is most important in this case .",
    "the thick solid histogram shows the observed width distribution in sand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for giant arc candidates with @xmath146 ( in our definition ) .",
    "this comparison does not yet fully account for the ( unknown ) redshift distribution of background sources and other potential biases .",
    "nevertheless , it appears very interesting that the size distribution is in better agreement with an effective source diameter of @xmath165 , although the tail indicates that larger sources are also needed .",
    "w04 emphasized the effect of matter along the line of sight on the arc statistics .",
    "we are unable to model the universe using multiple lens planes , as realistically performed by w04 .",
    "we can , however , investigate the effect of matter distribution ( e.g. , filaments ) surrounding the clusters . to do this",
    ", we increase the projection depth to @xmath167 mpc ( comoving ) and the lens area to a square with a side - length of @xmath168 .",
    "we write the new optical depths as @xmath169 and @xmath170 , in contrast to the values obtained using a cube of side length @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "[ fig : tau ] shows these optical depths as functions of the source redshift .",
    "clearly the matter distribution around the clusters increases the optical depth but the effect appears to be small ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "if the enhancement due to the large - scale structure along the line - of - sight is more important ( w04 ) , then the optical depth at higher source redshift will be affected more , which may partially explain why our optical depth increases somewhat more slowly as a function of source redshift than w04 , although hennawi , dalal & ostriker ( 2005 ) showed that multi - plane lensing changes the cross - section only slightly compared with the single - plane lensing ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) . in addition",
    "w04 used a power - spectrum normalization @xmath174 , slightly higher than our value ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this will also lead to a slightly higher optical depth because in their simulation , the clusters will form somewhat earlier , which will in turn preferentially boost the optical depth for a source at higher redshift as their optimal lens redshift is higher ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dtaudz ] ) .",
    "most of our conclusions agree with those of dalal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who used numerically - simulated clusters from the gif collaboration ( kauffmann et al .",
    "their mass and spatial resolutions are similar to ours . however , their overall optical depths are larger than ours by a factor of 6 for @xmath175 .",
    "the difference is partly due to the different definitions of the @xmath5 ratio .",
    "dalal et al .",
    "fit the giant arcs by a rectangle , rather than an ellipse as in our case .",
    "thus for the same giant arc , the @xmath5 ratio in dalal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is equal to @xmath15 times our @xmath5 ratio . as a result",
    ", their optical depth for giant arcs with @xmath113 should be compared with our value for @xmath176 .",
    "for example , for @xmath177 and 2 , our optical depths for giant arcs with @xmath112 ( in our definition ) are @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively .",
    "these should be compared with their corresponding values of @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "our value is about 70% of their value for a source at redshift 1.5 and 2 .",
    "but the discrepancy becomes larger for a source at redshift 1 . at such low redshift ,",
    "the cross - section is increasingly dominated by the few most massive clusters as the critical surface density increases , so the cosmic variance becomes important , particularly for the gif simulations which have a simulation volume 9.6 times smaller than ours .",
    "a detailed comparison between our numerical methods indicate that our cross - sections agree within @xmath183 for the same numerical cluster ( with the same projection ) selected from the gif simulations ( dalal 2005 , private communication ) agree within 10%-30% . ] .",
    "we believe that the remaining difference is due to the different mass functions in our simulations and the fact that dalal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used more than three projections to calculate the cross - sections for the more massive clusters .",
    "[ fig : massfunc ] shows that the gif mass function at large mass appears slightly higher than ours .",
    "this will increase their optical depths for giant arcs and likely explain the remaining difference .",
    "in this paper we used high - resolution numerically - simulated clusters to study the rate of giant arcs in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the methodology we used is similar to b98 , but the number of clusters in our simulations is about a factor of @xmath184 higher than previous studies ( e.g. , b98 and dalal et al . 2004 ) , so it should provide better statistics for the most massive clusters .",
    "we calculated the cross - section and optical depth as a function of the source redshift using ellipse - fitting and compared our results with those obtained with two approximate measures of the length - to - width ratio ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also found that the effects of source size and ellipticity on the optical depth are modest .",
    "furthermore , the matter distribution around clusters increases the lensing cross - section only slightly , by @xmath173 .",
    "our optical depth is about 10% of that found b98 .",
    "the difference arises because the two studies used two different @xmath10 values  b98 adopted a higher @xmath10 ( 1.12 ) than ours ( 0.9 ) .",
    "the higher @xmath10 value leads to both a higher number density and more concentrated clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : massfunc ] ) .",
    "both effects increase their optical depth .",
    "our results qualitatively confirm one important conclusion reached by w04 , namely that the optical depth is sensitive to the source redshift , but the rate of increase in our simulations is somewhat slower than theirs . the large - scale structure , which was included in w04 but ignored by us , will become more important as the source redshift increases , but whether this effect can explain the discrepancy in full is unclear ( see also dalal et al .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we find that their assumption , @xmath91 , over - estimates the number of giant arcs by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "better agreements were found between our study and dalal et al .",
    "once we account for the difference in the arc modeling ( ellipses vs. rectangles ) , our optical depth for giant arcs with @xmath176 is about 70% of that found by dalal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a source at redshift 1.5 and 2.0 . for a source at redshift 1 ,",
    "our prediction is about 40% of their value .",
    "we believe our differences are due to cosmic variance  the gif simulation has a cosmic volume that is 9.6 times smaller than ours , and their mass function appears to be somewhat higher than ours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : massfunc ] ) , which may explain their higher optical depth .",
    "both w04 and dalal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that the predicted and observed rates of giant arcs are consistent with each other .",
    "however , the comparison study we have performed leaves this question open .",
    "it appears to us that our predicted rate may be a factor of a few too low compared with the `` observed '' rate .",
    "however , this conclusion is not firm as both observations and theoretical predictions are uncertain .",
    "observationally , we need more transparent selection criteria ( see dalal et al .",
    "2004 for excellent discussions ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 determination from ground - based telescopes may be affected by seeing , leading to a likely under - estimate of the @xmath5 ratio as the widths of many arcs are unresolved .",
    "the recent extensive search for giant arcs with hst images ( sand et al . 2005 ) is a significant step in the right direction .",
    "observers need to report not only the @xmath5 ratio but also individual widths , which can provide important constraints on the inner density profile in clusters ( see  [ sec : comparisonsw04 ] ) .",
    "our predicted width distribution appears to better match the observed distribution of sand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) when the effective source diameter @xmath4 .",
    "however ,    a reliable prediction of the giant arcs also requires accurate information on the source population , including their redshift , size , magnitude , surface brightness and ellipticity .",
    "such information is of course a key objective for studying high - redshift galaxies .",
    "as the information is currently lacking , the prediction for the number of giant arcs has yet to enter the high - precision era .",
    "theoretically , we need higher resolution simulations in very large boxes so that we can sample the cluster mass function and resolve the internal structure of clusters simultaneously . numerical simulations with baryonic cooling and star formation will also be needed to make more detailed comparisons with observational data .",
    "while baryonic cooling is not expected to be very efficient in clusters of galaxies ( most baryons in clusters are still in the hot phase seen as x - rays ) , nevertheless , its effects may not be negligible , particularly for the giant arcs at small radii ( dalal et al . 2004 ; see also oguri 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , the recent study by puchwein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the effects of baryons on giant arcs depend on the detailed implementation of viscosity , star formation and feedback processes in simulations .",
    "if these effects can be implemented in practice , hydro - dynamical cosmological simulations also offer the possibility of a more direct comparison with observations , at least with the emss , as the x - ray luminosities of clusters of galaxies in these simulations can be predicted ( with some uncertainty ) , and hence we can apply similar selection criteria for clusters of galaxies as in observations and examine the number of giant arcs in these clusters .    as many observations converge to the concordance cosmology , it will be interesting to use lensing to constrain parameters such as @xmath10 independently in the @xmath185 flat cosmology . as the cluster mass function and internal structures both sensitively depend on @xmath10 , the arc statistics should provide a stringent limit on @xmath10 , as already illustrated by the difference between the current study and b98 .",
    "this parameter is still somewhat uncertain : some studies prefer values as high as 1.1 , while others prefer values as low as 0.7 ( see tegmark 2004 for a recent overview of current results ) .",
