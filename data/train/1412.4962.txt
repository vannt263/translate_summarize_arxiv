    "this decelerator differs from previously developed chip - based decelerators for polar ground - state molecules  @xcite and for rydberg atoms and molecules  @xcite , and other stark decelerators that employ continuously moving electric traps  @xcite , in that it is based upon the geometry of a surface - based transmission - line guide  @xcite .",
    "such electrostatic guides have been used to guide and deflect fast beams of helium atoms while providing two - dimensional transverse confinement .",
    "however , they do not provide longitudinal confinement and can not be used to accelerate or decelerate an atomic or molecular beam . to transform one of these guides into a device suitable for acceleration , or deceleration , of samples traveling in pulsed supersonic beams",

    "this geometry permits the generation of three - dimensional electric traps that provide strong confinement of atoms or molecules in all three spatial dimensions throughout the decelerator .",
    "it is compatible with the introduction of curvatures in the plane of the 2d electrode array without causing excessive distortion of the fields , and with direct coupling to transmission - line guides and beam - splitters .",
    "it also provides a well defined electromagnetic environment in which trapped rydberg atoms or molecules can be transported and manipulated .",
    "this is essential for investigating , and controlling , effects of blackbody radiation .    as in other rydberg - stark decelerators",

    "thereafter , the results of experiments in which beams of helium ( he ) atoms in rydberg - stark states with @xmath0 , and traveling with an initial speed of 1950  m / s , were guided at constant speed through the decelerator are presented .",
    "finally , the results of experiments involving the acceleration and deceleration of these atoms to final speeds ranging from 2700  m / s to 1350  m / s are discussed .",

    "the design , based upon that of an electrostatic transmission - line guide  @xcite , includes a 2d surface - based array of metallic electrodes , and a parallel plane metal plate . the 2d electrode array , located 4.5  mm below the upper plate , is composed of a segmented center - conductor surrounded on either side by two extended ground planes .",

    "the segments of the center - conductor are square , with sides of length 1  mm , and a center - to - center spacing @xmath8  mm .",
    "the electrode array used in the experiments described here was fabricated by chemical etching .",
    "electrical contact was made to the individual decelerator segments via small holes drilled through each to an array of miniature sockets located beneath the substrate .",

    "non - zero electric potentials applied to one single segment of the center - conductor and the upper plate , while all other electrodes including the ground planes are set to @xmath11  v , a single stationary three - dimensional electric field minimum is generated above this active segment .",
    "the resulting electric field distribution is analogous to that generated in two - dimensions in an electrostatic transmission - line guide  @xcite , and forms the basic field distribution around which the decelerator is designed . by applying an appropriate set of potentials to the complete 2d array of decelerator segments and upper plate , a periodic array of similar electric field minima",
    "can be generated within the device .",
    "the spatial periodicity of this array of electric field minima is dependent upon the number of electric potentials , and therefore decelerator segments , contributing to each .",
    "exploiting larger numbers of segments leads to increasingly harmonic traps with reduced variations in the trap - width with position along the decelerator axis . in the decelerator described here a set of five electric potentials",
    "are employed to achieve an appropriate compromise between the total number of unique potentials that must be generated , and any undesirable position dependence of the trap - widths .",
    "these five potentials are applied to consecutive decelerator segments and repeated periodically along the center conductor .",

    "the maximum usable value of @xmath26 is set by the onset of electric field ionization of the trapped rydberg atoms and is therefore @xmath3-dependent .",
    "for the rydberg - stark states with @xmath0 used in the experiments reported here , complete diabatic electric field ionization occurs at @xmath27  v / cm  @xcite . by operating the decelerator with @xmath19  v the fields experienced by the atoms as they travel through the decelerator",
    "are maintained below this value , limiting particle loss by direct field ionization .    to convey samples of trapped rydberg atoms through the decelerator",
    ", it is necessary to vary the positions of the electric traps in time .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a time - dependence to the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : timeindeppot ] ) . to realize a continuous motion of the array of traps in the positive @xmath9-dimension ,",
    "the potential applied to the decelerator electrodes is chosen to oscillate at an angular frequency @xmath28 , such that @xmath29.\\label{eq : timedeppot}\\ ] ] the speed with which the traps then move , @xmath30 , is directly proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath31 , and the spatial periodicity of the array , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "as the traps move through the decelerator in the positive @xmath9-dimension , their proportions change slightly as they travel from locations directly above a decelerator segment to those between two segments .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , where electric field distributions in the @xmath33-plane containing an electric field minimum are displayed at instants in time when a trap is located ( i ) directly above a decelerator segment , ( ii ) one quarter of the way between two segments , and ( iii ) half - way between two segments .",
    "when the trap is located directly above a decelerator segment it is deeper than when located half - way between two segments .",
    "the resulting breathing motion leads to an oscillation in the full - width - at - half - maximum of the traps of @xmath34 , and consequently a small amount of heating of the trapped atoms .",
    "however , if cold samples are confined close to a trap minimum heating effects arising from this breathing motion can be minimized .    when a potential @xmath35  v is applied to the ground planes of the decelerator , with @xmath19  v , the positions of the trap minima oscillate in the @xmath24-dimension as they travel through the decelerator .",
    "this oscillatory motion has a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath36 m as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . if not compensated , these oscillations give rise to a non - zero center - of - mass motion of the ensemble of trapped atoms in this dimension .",
    "this motion of the electric field minimum can be stabilized through the application of a time - dependent potential , @xmath37 , to the ground planes .",
    "for the decelerator described here , the optimal ground - plane potential was found to be one that oscillates in - phase with @xmath38 at a frequency @xmath39 , and with an amplitude of @xmath40 such that , @xmath41 the higher oscillation frequency of this potential , than those applied to the segments of the decelerator center - conductor , arises from the requirement that an equal correction to the position of the traps in the @xmath24-dimension is applied every time a trap is located above ( between etc  ) a decelerator segment .",
    "therefore the period of the oscillation of @xmath42 must equal the time taken for the traps to travel from one segment to the next , a distance @xmath31 .",
    "with this potential applied to the ground planes , the oscillation of the position of the trap minima in the @xmath24-dimension is reduced to an amplitude of less than @xmath43 m as indicated by the continuous black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .    when operated at a constant frequency the transmission - line decelerator can be used to convey trapped atoms or molecules at constant speed . to accelerate or decelerate the samples ,",
    "it is necessary to change the frequency of the oscillating electric potentials in time , introducing a frequency chirp . for a selected initial speed , @xmath44 , and an acceleration , @xmath45",
    ", the required time - dependent oscillation frequency can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the initial angular frequency .",
    "the introduction of a frequency chirp to accelerate , or decelerate , trapped samples leads to a reduction in the effective depth of the traps .",
    "this has been discussed previously in the context of chip - based decelerators for polar ground - state molecules  @xcite , with the consequences most clearly seen in the moving frame - of - reference associated with an individual electric field minimum . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a - i ) , and fig .  [ fig3](a - ii ) , the electric field distributions associated with a single trap of the decelerator are displayed in the @xmath33- and @xmath48-planes containing the electric field minimum .",

    "these are : ( 1 ) the acceleration tangential to the curvature of the decelerator , @xmath63 , that is exploited to modify the longitudinal motion of the atoms , and ( 2 ) the centripetal acceleration , @xmath64 , associated with the curvature of the decelerator .",
    "the effects of these two accelerations can be investigated by studying the shape of the moving traps in the @xmath33- and @xmath48-planes , respectively .    for a small section of the decelerator , as considered in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the tangential acceleration acts along the decelerator axis , i.e. , in the @xmath9-dimension . the effect of this acceleration can therefore be accounted for by adding the pseudo potential @xmath65 to the potential energy distribution in fig .",

    "[ fig3](d - ii ) . in the experiments reported here the initial longitudinal speed of the beams of he rydberg atoms was 1950",

    "the photoexcitation region in the apparatus was located between two parallel metallic plates labeled e1 and e2 in fig .",

    "excitation was performed for a period of @xmath85s in each experimental cycle . the time associated with the middle of this excitation pulse",
    "is defined as the photoexcitation time , @xmath86 . in the photoexcitation process",
    "the linear polarization of the two laser beams was chosen to permit the predominant excitation of hydrogenic rydberg - stark states with azimuthal quantum number @xmath87 .",
    "after photoexcitation , the excited rydberg atoms passed through a small aperture in electrode e2 and entered the transmission - line decelerator within which they were accelerated , decelerated or guided .",
    "in the final section of the apparatus , beyond the decelerator , the atoms were detected by pulsed electric field ionization upon the application of a pulsed potential of @xmath88  kv to e3 .",
    "the he@xmath89 ions produced following ionization of the excited atoms in the resulting electric field of @xmath90  v / cm were then accelerated toward a microchannel plate ( mcp ) detector .",
    "the detection geometry employed permitted the position of the rydberg atoms in the @xmath10-dimension , at the time of pulsed electric - field ionization , to be mapped onto the flight - time of the he@xmath89 ions to the mcp detector , i.e. , the ion signal corresponding to atoms that were located close to ( far from ) the mcp detector at the time of ionization arrived at early ( late ) times .",
    "an example of the mapping of ionization position onto he@xmath89 flight - time to the mcp is presented in fig .",
    "when the oscillating decelerator potentials are off , but the non - zero dc potential @xmath91  v is applied to the upper plate electrode , the excited rydberg atoms are ionized at a position in the detection region close to the mcp detector .",
    "the resulting he@xmath89 time - of - flight distribution has a maximum at 265  ns .",
    "however , if the oscillating decelerator potentials are activated , and set to guide atoms at constant speed over the full length of the decelerator , the curvature of the device leads to a displacement of the rydberg atoms into the negative @xmath10-dimension at the detection position . because the atoms are then located further from the mcp detector when ionized the he@xmath89 flight - time increases to 290  ns",
    ". accelerated , decelerated and guided atoms can therefore be selectively detected by integrating , and recording , only the delayed component of the time - of - flight distribution encompassed by the vertical bars at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the data displayed in this figure",
    "the signal recorded with the decelerator active is twice as large as that recorded with the oscillating decelerator potentials off because of the increased blackbody photoionization , and tunnel ionization rates in the residual dc electric field of 133  v / cm present in the latter case .",
    "to demonstrate and characterize the operation of the transmission - line decelerator , experiments have been performed in three modes of operation : ( 1 ) guiding at constant speed , ( 2 ) acceleration , and ( 3 ) deceleration .    for each type of experiment",
    "it was necessary to ensure that the oscillating decelerator potentials were activated at the optimal time to ensure that the @xmath85s ( @xmath92  mm ) long bunches of he rydberg atoms prepared in the photoexcitation region were efficiently loaded into a single moving trap .",
    "this was achieved by measuring the integrated signal from atoms guided through the curved decelerator at constant speed , as the activation time was varied .",
    "this measurement was therefore performed after a fixed rydberg atom flight - time from the photoexcitation region to the detection region , while recording only the signal in the delayed component of the he@xmath89 time - of - flight distribution ( see fig .",

    "the oscillation frequency therefore remained constant throughout the guiding process at @xmath94  khz .",
    "since only atoms that were guided away from their initial axis of propagation were detected in this experiment , the signal intensity rose when the atoms were efficiently loaded into one of the moving decelerator traps . as can be seen there are several activation times at which maxima occur in the signal associated with the guided atoms .",
    "these maxima correspond to the times at which the bunch of atoms is efficiently loaded into each consecutive moving trap of the decelerator .",
    "the temporal periodicity of these maxima corresponds to the time taken for the atoms to travel the 10  mm distance between consecutive traps , i.e. , @xmath95s .",
    "when the decelerator is activated at the incorrect time , few atoms are guided and a minimum is observed in the integrated he@xmath96 signal .",
    "the minima associated with these out - of - phase activation times do not reach zero intensity at times earlier than @xmath97s primarily because a small fraction of the @xmath98 mm long bunch of rydberg atoms always overlaps with one of the traps at these times when the propagation axis of the atomic beam and the axis of the decelerator coincide . at times greater than @xmath97s",
    "the atoms have traveled further into the decelerator when it is activated , to positions where the curved center - conductor and atomic beam axes do not overlap . in these cases ,",

    "away from these positions no guiding occurs and the he@xmath89 signal reduces to zero . from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , an activation time of @xmath99s was chosen for all experiments performed at an initial longitudinal speed @xmath100  m / s .",

    "comparison of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) with the time - of - flight distribution of the unperturbed atomic beam , fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , indicates that when guiding at low speeds ( 1750  m / s ) a large fraction , @xmath103 , of the excited atoms are efficiently guided through the decelerator",

    "[ fig9 ] , this effect alone does not completely describe the observed changes in guiding efficiency particularly for tangential velocities in the range from 1950  m / s to 2150  m / s . because the most significant reduction in guiding efficiency is observed for these speeds close to the intensity maximum of the bunch of excited atoms , and the densities of ground state he atoms and atoms in the metastable 1s2s@xmath105 state are approximately constant across the rydberg atom cloud , the anomalies in the guiding efficiency that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] are thought to arise from interactions between the trapped rydberg atoms as they travel through the decelerator .",

    "applying an acceleration of @xmath109  m / s@xmath2 , for a time of 39  @xmath108s , as the trapped atoms travel a distance of 86  mm through the decelerator leads to a final tangential velocity of 2400  m / s [ fig .",
    "[ fig10](v ) ] .",
    "the resulting accelerated beam arrives at the detection region 10  @xmath108s earlier than atoms guided at a constant speed of 1950  m / s .",
    "further increasing the acceleration to @xmath107  m / s@xmath2 , to accelerate the atoms over the same distance results in a final speed of 2700  m / s , and a further 4  @xmath108s reduction in flight - time to the detection region . at these high tangential velocities and accelerations ,",
    "the effective depth of the moving decelerator traps is less than @xmath110 times the depth when guiding at a constant speed of 1950  m / s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "since the bunches of rydberg atoms fill the moving trap into which they are loaded when the decelerator is activated , the change in the amplitude of the peak of the time - of flight distribution with acceleration is , to a first approximation , expected to scale linearly with trap depth .",
    "therefore the reduction in the amplitude of the accelerated bunch of atoms in fig .",
    "[ fig10](vi ) , to @xmath111 times that recorded when guiding at constant speed is close to that expected from the calculated data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    applying a negative frequency chirp to the decelerator waveforms leads to deceleration of the trapped atoms , and an increase in flight - time from the photoexcitation region to the detection region [ fig .",
    "[ fig10](i - iii ) ] .",
    "deceleration from an initial speed of 1950  m / s over a distance of 86  mm with @xmath112  m / s@xmath2 ( @xmath113  m / s@xmath2 ) , leads to a final tangential velocity of 1750  m / s ( 1550  m / s ) and an arrival time at the detection region @xmath85s ( @xmath114s ) after the bunch of atoms guided at a constant speed .",
    "further deceleration to a final speed of 1350  m / s over the same distance , with @xmath106  m / s@xmath2 , results in an arrival time in the detection region of @xmath115s , @xmath97s later than atoms guided at 1950",
    "when guiding at a constant speed of 1950  m / s the effective trap depth is @xmath116  k. however , when decelerating to 1350  m / s with @xmath106  m / s@xmath2 the mean effective trap depth is @xmath117  k. the corresponding experimental data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10](iv ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig10](i ) , exhibits a reduction to @xmath111 times the intensity of the signal from atoms guided at a constant speed of 1950  m / s , upon deceleration to 1350  m / s .",
    "similar deviations from the efficiencies expected to arise from changes in effective trap depth occur in each of the other sets of data in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . based upon the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the additional loss observed is thought to arise as a result of collisions between the trapped atoms during the deceleration process and a reduction in the detection efficiency of the decelerated bunches of atoms as they expand during their flight from the exit of the decelerator to the detection region .",
    "the transmission - line decelerator described here is a scalable device which is ideally suited to the high - speed transport , acceleration , deceleration and trapping of gas - phase samples of rydberg atoms and molecules .",
    "its design gives rise to symmetric electric traps which exhibit approximately equal depths in all three spatial dimensions , distinguishing it from previously developed chip - based decelerators , and permits it to be efficiently coupled to electrostatic transmission - line guides  @xcite .",
    "as has been demonstrated , the array of square , surface - based electrodes that form the segmented center - conductor permit the introduction of curvatures in the plane of the surface without causing excessive distortion to the symmetry of the resulting traps .",
    "the presence of the upper plate electrode creates a very well defined electromagnetic environment within the decelerator structure .",
    "this is of particular importance for applications , including those in hybrid approaches to quantum information processing , in which inhibition of the absorption of blackbody radiation  @xcite , or spontaneous emission at microwave frequencies  @xcite , is desirable .",
    "the large electric field gradients that can be generated in these transmission - line decelerators permits the controlled removal of significant amounts of kinetic energy from atomic beams over comparatively short distances and timescales .",
    "indeed , the maximal deceleration , from 1950  m / s to 1350  m / s with @xmath106  m / s@xmath2 , demonstrated here corresponds to a change in kinetic energy of @xmath118  mev ( @xmath119  @xmath120 ) .",
    "as far as we are aware , this constitutes the largest removal of kinetic energy from a beam of rydberg atoms or molecules reported in the literature to date .",
    "the possibility of using transmission - line decelerators to remove large amounts of kinetic energy from samples of heavy molecules in high rydberg states opens up exciting prospects for studies of molecular decay processes of importance in the evolution and chemical reactivity of plasmas in the upper atmosphere of the earth  @xcite . as can be seen in the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the possibility of generating amplified oscillating electric potentials with frequencies approaching 1  mhz makes these transmission - line decelerators very well suited to the manipulation of atoms and molecules at speeds exceeding 2500 m / s .",
    "this will be beneficial for the rapid transport of samples within spatially separated regions of cryogenic experimental apparatus for applications in hybrid quantum information processing , and essential for experiments involving the deceleration and manipulation of beams of light positronium rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "the observed effects of the density of electrically trapped rydberg atoms on the efficiencies with which they can be manipulated when in states with the high values @xmath3 employed here , indicate that it will be necessary to carefully consider the role of collisions within ensembles of trapped atoms or molecules in future spectroscopy and scattering experiments where the preparation of guided or decelerated samples in selected internal quantum states is of importance . in hybrid approaches to quantum information processing involving atoms in rydberg states with values of @xmath121 , and superconducting microwave circuits",
    ", these effects may also impose a limit on the particle numbers and densities that can be employed while preserving long rydberg - state coherence times .",
