    "the object of this paper is to compare two paths in the teichmller space @xmath12 of @xmath2 determined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the first is the teichmller geodesic @xmath13 , whose time @xmath11 riemann surface @xmath14 supports a quadratic differential @xmath15 whose horizontal and vertical foliations are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the second is the kerckhoff line of minima @xmath18 @xcite . at time @xmath11",
    ", @xmath19 is the unique hyperbolic surface that minimizes the length function @xmath20 on @xmath21 .",
    "( recall that @xmath22 can be characterized as the locus in @xmath12 where the product of the extremal lengths @xmath23 is minimized @xcite . )",
    "lines of minima have many properties in common with teichmller geodesics , see  @xcite , and have been shown to be closely linked to deforming fuchsian into quasi - fuchsian groups by bending , see  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in comparing the two trajectories @xmath22 and @xmath24 , in particular , to see whether or not they remain a bounded distance apart .",
    "if both @xmath6 and @xmath4 are contained in the thick part of @xmath21 , it is relatively easy to show that the distance between them is uniformly bounded independently of @xmath11 , see theorem  [ thm : warmup ] .",
    "a more surprising fact is that in general , the sets of short curves on @xmath22 and @xmath24 are the same . writing @xmath25 for the geodesic lengths of a simple closed curve @xmath26 in the hyperbolic metrics on @xmath27 respectively , we prove :    [ shortonboth ] the set of short curves on @xmath6 and @xmath4 coincide .",
    "more precisely , there exist universal constants @xmath28 such that for each @xmath11 , @xmath29 implies @xmath30 and @xmath31 implies @xmath32 .",
    "finding combinatorial estimates for the lengths of these short curves occupies the main part of the paper and leads to a coarse estimate of the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that along both @xmath22 and @xmath24 there are two distinct reasons why a curve @xmath33 can become short : either the relative twisting of @xmath9 and @xmath10 about @xmath33 is large , or @xmath0 and @xmath1 have large relative complexity in @xmath34 ( the completion of the surface @xmath2 minus @xmath33 ) , in the sense that every essential arc or closed curve in @xmath34 must have large intersection with @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "our results give sufficient control to construct examples which show that @xmath6 and @xmath4 may or may not remain a bounded distance apart .",
    "the estimates for curves which become short along @xmath22 are based on rafi  @xcite . for convenience",
    "we say a curve is ` extremely short ' on a given surface if its hyperbolic length is less than some fixed constant @xmath35 defined in terms of the margulis constant , see section  [ sec : ttdecomp ] .",
    "rafi s results imply :    [ shortong ] suppose that @xmath26 is extremely short on @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath36    the terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspond respectively to the relative twisting and large relative complexity mentioned above .",
    "more precisely , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the _ balance time _ at which @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the relative twisting , that is , the difference between the twisting of @xmath9 and @xmath10 around @xmath26 , see section  [ sec : reltwist ] .",
    "the term @xmath38 depends on the ( possibly coincident ) thick components @xmath43 that are adjacent to @xmath26 in the thick - thin decomposition of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the area @xmath44 quadratic differential on @xmath6 whose horizontal and vertical foliations are respectively @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "associated to @xmath15 is a singular euclidean metric ; we denote the geodesic length of a curve @xmath47 in this metric by @xmath48 , see section  [ sec : quaddiffs ] . by definition @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the length of the shortest non - trivial , non - peripheral simple closed curve on @xmath51 with respect to the @xmath15-metric , see section  [ sec : thickthin ] .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is a similar characterization of curves which become short along @xmath52 .",
    "we prove that the hyperbolic length @xmath53 of a short curve in @xmath4 is estimated as follows :    [ shortonl ] suppose that @xmath26 is extremely short on @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath54    the main tool in the proof is the well - known derivative formula of kerckhoff  @xcite and wolpert  @xcite for the variation of length with respect to fenchel - nielsen twist , together with the extension proved by series  @xcite for variation with respect to the lengths of pants curves .    to estimate the teichmller distance between two surfaces that have the same set of short curves one uses minsky s product region theorem @xcite . to apply this , in addition to theorems  [ shortong ] and  [ shortonl ]",
    ", we need to estimate the distance between the hyperbolic thick components of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , and also the difference between the fenchel - nielsen twist coordinates corresponding to the short curves in the two surfaces . in theorem",
    "[ thm : markingsclose ] and corollary  [ equiv ] , we show that the distance between the corresponding thick components is bounded .",
    "in theorem  [ thm : twistonl ] , we estimate the twist of @xmath9 and @xmath10 around @xmath26 at @xmath4 .",
    "combined with the analogous estimate for @xmath6 proved in @xcite , we are able to show that the contribution to the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath4 from the twisting is dominated by that from the lengths , leading to    [ distance ] the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath55 where the maximum is taken over all curves @xmath26 that are short in @xmath56 .    theorems  [ shortong ] ,  [ shortonl ] , and  [ distance ] enable us to construct the various examples alluded to above . because @xmath38 can become arbitrarily large while @xmath37 remains bounded , it follows that @xmath6 and @xmath4 do not always remain a bounded distance apart .",
    "however , in the case in which @xmath2 is a once - punctured torus or four - times - punctured sphere , it turns out that the quantity @xmath38 is always bounded and therefore that the two paths are always within bounded distance of each other .",
    "these ideas are taken further in  @xcite , where we show that @xmath4 is a quasi - geodesic .    the greater part of the work of this paper is contained in the proof of theorem  [ shortonl ] .",
    "it is carried out in several steps .",
    "first , using the derivative formulae mentioned above , we show in theorem  [ thm : shortonl ] that the length may be estimated by a formula identical to that in theorem  [ shortonl ] , except that @xmath38 is replaced by another geometric quantity @xmath57 here @xmath58 are those pants curves in a short pants decomposition of @xmath59 ( see section  [ sec : shortmarkings ] ) which are boundaries of pants adjacent to @xmath26 , while as above @xmath60 denotes length in the singular euclidean metric associated to @xmath15 .",
    "this is the content of section  [ sec : shortlm ] .",
    "we now need to compare @xmath61 and @xmath62 . from the definition",
    "it is quite easy to show ( proposition  [ cor : shorteronl ] ) that @xmath63 . in particular",
    ", it follows that a curve that is short in @xmath6 is at least as short in @xmath4 .",
    "next , we show in proposition  [ bddbelow ] that on a subsurface whose injectivity radius is bounded below in @xmath56 , the injectivity radius with respect to @xmath4 is also bounded below , perhaps by a smaller constant . the main point in the proof",
    "is proposition  [ lem : minimalonq ] , which shows that the hyperbolic metric on @xmath4 not only minimizes the sum of lengths @xmath64 , but also , up to multiplicative error , it minimizes the contribution of @xmath65 to each thick component of the thick - thin decomposition of @xmath6 .",
    "this proves theorem  [ shortonboth ] .",
    "having set up a one - to - one correspondence between the thick components of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , we show in theorem  [ thm : markingsclose ] and corollary  [ equiv ] that the distance between corresponding thick components is bounded .",
    "finally we are able to prove in proposition  [ lem : handk ] that @xmath66 , completing the proof of theorem  [ shortonl ] .    prior to this paper ,",
    "the only results related to the relative behavior of @xmath22 and @xmath24 were some partial results about their behavior at infinity .",
    "results of masur  @xcite ( for teichmller geodesics ) and of daz and series  @xcite ( for lines of minima ) show that if either @xmath67 are supported on closed curves , or if @xmath67 are uniquely ergodic , then @xmath22 and @xmath24 limit on the same points in the thurston boundary of @xmath68 . in general",
    ", the question of the behavior at infinity remains unresolved , but see also  @xcite which shows that there are teichmller geodesics @xmath22 which do not converge in thurston s compactification of @xmath21 .",
    "it is not hard to apply the results of this paper to show the same is true of lines of minima in lenzhen s example ; we hope to explore this in more detail elsewhere .",
    "the motivation for our approach stems in part from a central ingredient of the proof of the ending lamination theorem  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 is a hyperbolic @xmath70-manifold homeomorphic to @xmath71 .",
    "the ending lamination theorem states that @xmath69 is completely determined by the asymptotic invariants of its two ends .",
    "a key step is to show that if these end invariants are induced by the laminations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then the curves on @xmath2 which have short geodesic representatives in @xmath69 can be characterized in terms of their combinatorial relationship to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "( the relationship is expressed using the complex of curves of @xmath2 , details of which are not needed in what follows .",
    "roughly speaking , a curve is short in @xmath69 if and only if the distance between the projections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to some subsurface @xmath72 is large in the curve complex of @xmath73 . ) in  @xcite , rafi found a similar combinatorial characterization which shows that the curves which are short in @xmath69 are almost , but not quite , the same as those curves which become short along @xmath74 .",
    "our definition of @xmath75 is closely related to rafi s study  @xcite of the relationship between the thick - thin decomposition of a hyperbolic surface @xmath2 and a quadratic differential metric on the same surface .",
    "the relationship between these two metrics plays a key role throughout the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall some background facts about lines of minima and geodesics . in section 3 , we prove theorem  [ thm : warmup ] mentioned above , which states that if both @xmath6 and @xmath4 are contained in the thick part of @xmath21 , then the distance between them is bounded .",
    "we hope that treating this special case separately early on will give some intuition about what needs to be done in general . in section 4 , we review twists and fenchel - nielsen coordinates and in section 5 , after reviewing some fundamental facts about quadratic differential metrics , we derive theorem  [ shortong ] and state the estimates for twists about short curves proved in @xcite . in section 6 , we prove theorem  [ thm : shortonl ] and derive estimates for twists about the short curves . finally , in section 7 , we prove theorems   [ shortonboth ] , [ shortonl ] and  [ distance ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we make use of several basic length estimates on hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "the proofs , being somewhat long but relatively straightforward , are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we thank the referee for carefully reading the manuscript and leading us to clarify the exposition .",
    "throughout , @xmath2 is an orientable hyperbolizable surface of finite type , possibly with punctures but with no other boundary .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the set of free homotopy classes of non - peripheral , non - trivial simple closed curves on @xmath2 . if @xmath77 is a surface with hyperbolic metric @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we write @xmath80 for the hyperbolic length of the unique geodesic representative of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "the margulis lemma provides a universal constant @xmath81 such that all components of the @xmath82-thin part of @xmath83 ( i.e.  the subset of @xmath2 where the injectivity radius is less than @xmath82 ) are horocyclic neighborhoods of cusps or annular collars about short geodesics . the @xmath82-thick part of the surface is the complement of the thin part .    for our purposes",
    ", it is necessary to choose a constant @xmath84 sufficiently smaller than @xmath82 , in order that the @xmath85-thick - thin decomposition of a surface satisfies certain geometric conditions .",
    "these conditions will be mentioned when the context arises , but we assume that @xmath85 has been chosen once and for all so that these conditions are met .",
    "if @xmath86 , we shall say that @xmath26 is _ extremely short _ in @xmath78 .",
    "since we will be dealing mainly with coarse estimates , we want to avoid keeping track of constants which are universal , in that they do not depend on any specific metric or curve under discussion . for functions",
    "@xmath87 we write @xmath88 and @xmath89 to mean respectively , that there are constants @xmath90 , depending only on the topology of @xmath2 and the fixed constant @xmath85 , such that @xmath91 the symbols @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 are defined similarly . for a positive quantity @xmath96 ,",
    "we often write @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 to indicate @xmath96 is bounded above by a constant depending only on the topology of @xmath2 and @xmath85 , and more generally we write @xmath99 to mean that @xmath100 for a positive function @xmath73 .",
    "we denote the space of measured laminations on @xmath2 by @xmath101 . given any hyperbolic metric @xmath78 on @xmath2 , a measured lamination @xmath102 can be realized as a geodesic measured lamination with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "the hyperbolic length function extends by linearity and continuity to @xmath101 ; we write @xmath103 for the hyperbolic length of a lamination @xmath102 .",

    "each conformal structure @xmath116 is uniformized by a unique hyperbolic structure @xmath78 , and conversely , each hyperbolic structure @xmath78 has an underlying conformal structure @xmath114 .",

    "we give a brief summary of facts about quadratic differentials that we use and refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed and comprehensive background .",

    "in this section we prove theorem  [ thm : warmup ] , which states that if @xmath6 and @xmath4 are in the @xmath85-thick part @xmath168 of space , then the distance between them is uniformly bounded by a constant that depends only on the topology of @xmath2 and @xmath85 .",
    "the idea is to first approximate the length of a curve @xmath169 for any @xmath170 by its intersection with what we call a _ short marking _ for @xmath78 , and then to compare the short markings for @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
