    "adaptive control is one of the major control techniques of handling uncertainties in nonlinear systems and has still attracted great concern in recent years @xcite .",
    "in particular , _ model reference adaptive control _ ( mrac ) is a popular adaptive control architecture which aims to make an uncertain dynamical system behave like a chosen reference model .",
    "the way of parameter estimation in adaptive control gives rise to two different schemes , namely indirect and direct schemes @xcite .",
    "_ composite adaptive control _ ( cac ) is an integrated direct and indirect adaptive control technique which aims to achieve better tracking and parameter estimation through faster and smoother parameter adaptation @xcite . in the cac ,",
    "prediction errors are generated by identification models , and both tracking errors and prediction errors are applied to update parametric estimates .",
    "the superiority of cac on performance improvement has been demonstrated in many control designs , where some latest results can be referred to @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as in the classical adaptive control , cac only achieves asymptotic convergence of tracking errors and does not guarantee parameter convergence unless plant states satisfy the condition of persistent excitation ( pe ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pe condition is very strict and often infeasible to monitor online in practical control systems @xcite .",
    "learning is one of the fundamental features of autonomous intelligent behavior , and it is closely related to parameter convergence in adaptive control @xcite .",
    "the benefits brought by parameter convergence include accurate closed - loop identification , exponential stability and robustness against measurement noise @xcite .",
    "an emerging _ concurrent learning _ technique provides a feasible and promising way for achieving parameter convergence without the pe condition in mrac @xcite .",
    "the difference between the concurrent learning and the composite adaptation lies in how to construct prediction errors . in the concurrent learning ,",
    "a dynamic data stack constituted by online recorded data is used in constructing prediction errors , singular value maximization is applied to maximize the singular value of the data stack , and exponential convergence of both tracking errors and estimation errors is guaranteed if regression functions of plant uncertainties are excited over a time interval such that sufficiently rich data are recorded in the data stack . yet in this innovative design , the singular value maximization leads to an exhaustive search over all recorded data , and the requirement on the derivation of all plant states for calculating prediction errors is stringent .",
    "this paper proposes a novel model reference composite learning control ( mrclc ) strategy for a class of parametric uncertain affine nonlinear systems . in the composite learning , a modified modelling error that can utilize online recorded data",
    "is constructed as the prediction error , a second - order command filter is applied to alleviate the derivation of plant states , and both the tracking error and the prediction error are applied to update parametric estimates .",
    "it is proven that the closed - loop system achieves global exponential - like stability under interval excitation ( ie ) rather than pe of regression functions .",
    "consequently , the limitations of concurrent learning are alleviated by the proposed mrclc design .",
    "the effectiveness and superiority of this approach is verified by the application to an inverted pendulum control problem with the comparison with some existing adaptive control approaches .",
    "the notations of this paper are relatively standard , where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the spaces of real numbers , positive real numbers , real @xmath4-dimensional vectors , and @xmath5-dimensional matrixes , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the absolute value and euclidean - norm , respectively , @xmath8 denotes the space of bounded signals , @xmath9 denotes the ball of radius @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the minimum and maximum functions , respectively , sgn@xmath13 is the sign function , rank@xmath14 is the rank of @xmath15 , diag@xmath13 is a diagonal matrix , and @xmath16 represents the space of functions whose @xmath17-order derivatives all exist and are continuous , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath4 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 are positive integers .",
    "this section discusses the formulation of learning from the classical mrac . for clear illustration ,",
    "consider a class of _ _ n__th order affine nonlinear systems as follows @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24^t$ ] , @xmath25 , @xmath26^t \\in \\mathbb r^n$ ] is the vector of plant states , @xmath27 is the control input , and @xmath28 is the @xmath29 model uncertainty .",
    "a reference model that characterizes the desired response of the system ( [ eq01 ] ) is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31^t \\in \\mathbb r^n$ ] , in which @xmath32 is a strictly hurwitz matrix , @xmath33^t \\in \\mathbb r^n$ ] is the vector of reference model states , and @xmath34 @xmath35 is a bounded reference signal .",
    "this study is based on the facts that @xmath36 is measurable , @xmath37 is controllable , and @xmath38 is linearly parameterizable such that @xcite @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is a unknown constant parameter vector , @xmath41 is a known regression function vector , and @xmath42 is a known constant .",
    "the following definitions are given for facilitating control synthesis .",
    "* definition 1 * @xcite : a bounded signal @xmath43 is of ie over @xmath44 $ ] if there exist constants @xmath45 with @xmath46 such that @xmath47 holds .",
    "* definition 2 * @xcite : a bounded signal @xmath43 satisfies the pe condition if there exist constants @xmath48 such that @xmath49 holds , @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51^t$ ] be an augmented reference signal , and @xmath52 be an estimate of @xmath53 . define a tracking error @xmath54 , and an estimation error @xmath55 .",
    "our objective is to design a proper parametric update law of mrac such that both @xmath56 and @xmath57 exponentially converge to * 0 * under the ie rather than the pe conation .",
    "from @xcite , the mrac law can be designed as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes a proportional - derivative ( pd ) feedback part , @xmath60 denotes a reference signal feedforward part , @xmath61 denotes an adaptive part , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are control gains , and the design of @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 thus , one obtains the tracking error dynamics @xmath66 where @xmath67 is designed to be strictly hurwitz .",
    "thus , for any matrix @xmath68 , a unique solution @xmath69 exists for the following lyapunov equation : @xmath70    let the adaptive law of @xmath71 be as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a learning rate , and @xmath74 is a projection operator given by @xcite @xmath75 choose a lyapunov function candidate @xmath76 with @xmath77^t \\in \\mathbb r^{n+n}$ ] for the closed - loop dynamics composed of ( [ eq06 ] ) and ( [ eq08 ] ) .",
    "it follows from the classical mrac result of @xcite that if @xmath78 and @xmath79 is of pe , then the closed - loop system ( [ eq06 ] ) with ( [ eq08 ] ) achieves _ global exponential stability _ in the sense that both the tracking error @xmath80 and the estimation error @xmath81 converge to * 0*.    to remove the requirement of the pe condition on @xmath79 for parameter convergence in @xcite , a concurrent learning law of @xmath71 is proposed in @xcite as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a certain epoch , @xmath84 is the number of stored data , and @xmath85 denotes a modelling error which is regarded as the prediction error calculated by @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are online recorded data of @xmath36 , @xmath90 and @xmath71 at the epoch @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath91 $ ] @xmath92 be a dynamic data stack .",
    "it is shown in the concurrent learning mrac approach of @xcite that if @xmath93 @xmath94 and rank@xmath95 on @xmath96 , then the closed - loop system ( [ eq06 ] ) with ( [ eq10 ] ) achieves _ global exponential - like stability _ in the sense that both the tracking error @xmath56 and the estimation error @xmath57 converge to * 0 * on @xmath96 . yet in the approach of @xcite , fixed - point smoothing must be applied to estimate @xmath97 in ( [ eq11 ] ) such that the prediction error @xmath98 is calculable , and singular value maximization should be applied to exhaustively search the data stack @xmath99 to maximize its singular value .      define a modified modelling error @xmath100 as the prediction error , in which @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 in which @xmath104 is an integral duration , @xmath105 is the minimal singular value of @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the time when @xmath108 reaches its maximum .",
    "then , a composite learning law of @xmath109 is designed as follows : @xmath110 in which @xmath111 is a weight factor .    from @xmath112 and ( [ eq12 ] ) ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath113 can follow the calculation of @xmath114 as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is directly obtainable by ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , and @xmath117 is not directly obtainable .",
    "multiplying both sides of ( [ eq06 ] ) by @xmath118 , integrating the resulting equality over @xmath119 $ ] and making some transformations , one gets @xmath120 in which the time variable @xmath121 is omitted in the above integral part .",
    "since @xmath122 is unavailable , a second - order linear filter with unit gain is implemented as follows @xcite : @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the natural frequency , @xmath127 is the damping factor , and @xmath128 and @xmath129 are estimates of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the integral in ( [ eq16 ] ) effectively reduces the influence of measurement noise on the calculation of @xmath117 .",
    "thus , @xmath132 in ( [ eq17 ] ) can be made sufficiently small so that @xmath133 . for simplifying analysis ,",
    "assume that @xmath134 as in @xcite .",

    "* theorem 1 * : consider the system ( [ eq01 ] ) driven by the control law ( [ eq04 ] ) with ( [ eq14 ] ) , where the control gain @xmath64 is designed to satisfy ( [ eq05 ] ) , and the control gain @xmath135 is selected to make @xmath15 in ( [ eq06 ] ) strictly hurwitz .",
    "if @xmath78 and @xmath136 are satisfied with @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 , then the closed - loop system composed of ( [ eq06 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) achieves _ global exponential - like stability _ in the sense that all closed - loop signals are bounded for all @xmath141 and both the tracking error @xmath80 and the estimation error @xmath81 exponentially converge to * 0 * on @xmath96 .",

    "since @xmath149 is satisfied @xmath152 and @xmath143 in ( [ eq09 ] ) is radially unbounded ( i.e. @xmath153 as @xmath154 ) , the stability is global . using @xmath151",
