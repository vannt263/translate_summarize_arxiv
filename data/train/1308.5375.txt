    "the heavy quarkonium provides an ideal platform to investigate the properties of the bound states .",

    "the nrqcd is an effective field theory for separating the relativistic effects from the nonrelativistic contributions of different @xmath28 order , @xmath29 being the typical velocity of heavy quark or antiquark in the quarkonium rest frame , whose relative importance can be estimated by the velocity scaling rules .",
    "it provides the definitions of nonperturbative contributions from the long - distance part and makes us possible to do numerical calculations directly . in the present paper",
    ", we shall concentrate our attention on the charmonium exclusive production at the @xmath30 collider .",
    "that is , we shall compute the cross - sections for the exclusive processes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the dominant color - singlet @xmath9-wave and @xmath10-wave charmonium states respectively .",

    "the double charmonium exclusive production channel @xmath33 has been measured by the belle  @xcite and the babar collaborations  @xcite .",

    "$ ] denotes the branching fraction for the @xmath19 meson decaying into at least two charged tracks .",
    "these measurements are unexpectedly large in comparison with the leading order ( lo ) calculation  @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions are challenging issues in nrqcd .",
    "it arouses people s great interest , many suggestions have been tried to explain the puzzle  @xcite , in which either the higher @xmath37 order pqcd corrections or the relativistic corrections or the nonperturbative corrections have been considered .    by taking both the radiative and relativistic corrections into account , ref.@xcite got @xmath38 = 17.6^{+8.1}_{-6.7 } \\ ; { \\rm fb}$ ] , the authors there then optimistically concluded that such disagreement has been resolved .",
    "however , one may doubt the validity of the @xmath37- and @xmath39- expansion in the process @xmath40 , if the lo result is an order of magnitude smaller than the experimental measurements and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections / higher @xmath39-expansion terms inversely play a dominate role for the double charmonium production .",
    "furthermore , refs.@xcite showed that the large renormalization scale dependence of the cross section under the conventional scale setting can not be improved even with the nlo correction .",
    "it is therefore helpful to find another experimental platform to check all theoretical estimations . a super @xmath2 factory running at an energy around the @xmath1-boson mass with a high luminosity @xmath41  @xcite , similar to the gigaz program of the internal linear collider  @xcite ,",

    "because only one bound state in the final state , one can adopt it to extract more subtle properties of the charmonium .",
    "considering the high luminosity and a clean environment at the super @xmath2 factory  @xcite , due to the @xmath1-boson resonance effect , more and more rare decays and productions can be observed and measured .",
    "it is interesting to show how the charmonium is produced at the super @xmath2 factory .    in this paper",
