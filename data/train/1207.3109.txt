    "we know the age of the universe from the expansion rate and from the nuclear burning rate of the oldest stars .",
    "the agreement between these two approaches is one of the pillars of the standard cosmology ( mould 1999 ) .",
    "to learn about galaxy formation we must be able to age date the halos of galaxies .",
    "this is difficult because a notorious degeneracy between age and metallicity affects the integrated spectra of galaxies ( faber 1973 , mould 1978 , schmidt , bica & dottori 1989 ) . in this letter",
    "we show that it is possible to deal with this problem by concentrating on the main sequence turnoff , where the age information in stellar populations resides , and by seeking separate spectral diagnostics of turnoff temperature and metallicity .",
    "age resolution of a billion years is possible . given the level of testing that main sequence evolution and the standard solar model have been subjected to , one can be reasonably confident about the uncertainties .",
    "the nuisance parameters of post main sequence stellar evolution : the mixing length to pressure scale height ratio , the reimers mass loss parameter , the convective overshoot parameter and the horizontal branch ( hb ) color distribution are avoided .",
    "a comprehensive study of the spectra of old stellar populations has been made by worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "mendel 2007 point out that modelling of hb morphologies is difficult , as the interplay of contributing effects is not known well enough to be modeled purely from theory .",
    "prescriptive methods have tended to be adopted .",
    "maraston & thomas ( 2000 ) find that a mass - loss prescription is able to reproduce the strong balmer lines found in old elliptical galaxy populations , as well as the trends of increasing h@xmath1 line strengths in low - metallicity galactic globular clusters .",
    "methods of breaking the hb / age degeneracy in the balmer lines have been discussed by schiavon ( 2004 ) .",
    "many of the galaxies we wish to study in a broad analysis of the formation of the first stars across the hubble sequence of galaxies are at the distance of the virgo cluster , where the main sequence turnoff of old stellar populations is at magnitude 35 , intractable for current and planned telescopes . however , if we place our 30 meter class telescope s spectrograph slit across the outer parts of ngc 4472 , say , and the seeing is good , we can in long exposures recognise individual horizontal branch stars at magnitude 32 .",
    "if we study the light between these stars and further exclude stars with red colors ( subgiants ) , we have a sample of turnoff stars , which are ideal for age and metallicity study .",
    "a quantitative example would be a study of a stellar population at 16 effective radii , 8.3 mag down from the central surface brightness of a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "if the local surface brightness is 27.5 mag / s@xmath2 , a square arcsec would contain 2000 l@xmath3 at virgo .",
    "this would be composed ( by the fuel burning theorem , greggio & renzini 2011 , renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) of some 500 main sequence stars and 4 horizontal branch stars .",
    "this is a feasible proposition for a large telescope in natural seeing .",
    "sky subtraction is a challenge at this surface brightness , of course . working closer to the nucleus",
    "would require adaptive optics .",
    "an integral field unit spectrograph has a great advantage in this application .",
    "if the fibers are critically matched to the seeing , 4 fibers are lost in order to mask each horizontal branch star . however , in practise , rather than waste the light of hb stars , one would simply separate their spectra and make use of this information to constrain other parameters .",
    "the same goes for subgiant stars .",
    "consider two diagnostics , h@xmath1 and the ca k line , readily measurable in blue metal poor spectra .",
    "we write their line strengths , equivalent widths for example : @xmath4 @xmath5 in the usual notation with g = log(gravity ) , t = log(effective temperature ) , and z = log(metal fraction ) . expanding around the main sequence turnoff we have @xmath6 @xmath7 we also have for turnoff stars @xmath8 @xmath9 where t is the log of the age of the simple stellar population . to evaluate these age and metallicity dependences , we use padova yzvar isochrones for helium fraction y = 0.23 ( bertelli 2008 ) .",
    "we find for z = 4 that @xmath10 = 0.0062 at the oldest ages and @xmath11 = 0.0945 & @xmath12 = 0.017 .",
    "synthetic line strength calculations from stellar atmospheres furnish the remaining information we need . according to kurucz models(figure 1 ) at [ fe / h ] = 2 , @xmath13 = 1.1 , while at 6000k @xmath14 = 0.08 and @xmath15 = 0.03 .",
    "similar results are obtained by onehag et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "we find from the synthetic spectrum calculations using moog ( sneden 2012 ) and current atlas models ( see kurucz 1970 , 1986 for the heritage ) : @xmath16 = 50 ; @xmath17 = 0.5 and @xmath18 = 3 .",
    "ca k is measured as an equivalent width ( ew ) in  .",
    "moog calculates ews by direct integration of the ( continuum , line profile ) difference .",
    "the ews are already tabulated in the h@xmath1 case . based on the solar spectrum ,",
    "one might question how well defined the cak continuum is .",
    "however , there is no issue in the galaxy halo case z ",
    "z@xmath19 1 .",
    "solar abundance ratios are assumed and 2 km / s of microturbulence .",
    "strictly one should also broaden the stellar line profiles with a galaxy velocity distribution .",
    "however , ews are invariant to such post - broadening , for stellar rotation , instrumental broadening , or macroturbulence .",
    "stellar population broadening has therefore not been done here .",
    "similar results to figure 2 were obtained by franchini ( 2011 ) .",
    "thus we end up with @xmath20 @xmath21 one can formally eliminate metallicity or simply write : @xmath22 .",
    "now imagine comparing a 13 gyr simple stellar population ( main sequence only ) with a 13 @xmath23 2.303@xmath24 gyr younger one .",
    "subtracting the two spectra , one would see a @xmath25 given approximately by equation ( 4 ) .",
    "stars on the main sequence of lower mass than the turnoff would tend to cancel out .",
    "in the preceding section the assumption has been that a stellar spectrum depends on ( g , t , z ) and that age can be deduced from hydrogen and metal lines to the limits of observational error .",
    "however , the study of @xmath26 cen has taught us that helium abundance is important and the systematics of [ o / fe ] as a function of z ( pilachowski & armandroff 1996 , cohen & bell 1986 ) remind us that oxygen is the most abundant metal .",
    "blue horizontal branch stars ( schiavon 2007 ) can tell us both helium abundance and oxygen abundance .",
    "in red giants the 6300   line measures oxygen abundance .",
    "fibers that intercept the light from these stars can therefore be used to diagnose oxygen and helium anomalies in disintegrated spectra . however",
    ", this is beyond the scope of the present letter . for the time",
    "being it is reasonable to assume that z predicts o / fe and that helium has its cosmological abundance in protogalactic halos .",
    "alpha element enhancement has also been a subject of interest in the integrated light of early type galaxies .",
    "figure 4 shows the prediction for the mg / fe ratio of metal poor turnoff stars .",
    "the iron line is 100200 m   in equivalent width .",
    "again , as a starting point in this letter , it is assumed that @xmath27/fe is a constant in protogalactic halos and can be omitted from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "figure 4 is a precursor of a more detailed study , which , fortunately , is made easier by the existence of appropriate kurucz models .",
    "the work of dotter ( 2007 ) notwithstanding , if @xmath27/fe can be omitted from equation ( 1 ) , it can also be omitted from the age error budget , provided a non-@xmath27 element metal line is also observed .",
    "an observational error of 0.005 in @xmath1 corresponds to an uncertainty of 1 gyr at 12 gyr .",
    "this is useful for distinguishing chemodynamical models of rapid initial collapse from those of assembly through mergers up to redshift 2 . a full evolutionary synthesis model , following leitherer ( 1999 ) and maraston ( 2003 ) , is now warranted to include light from the full main sequence , rather than just the turnoff itself .",
    "other lines should also be considered , such as the ca triplet and the paschen lines in the near infrared .",
    "foster ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011 ) have pioneered the study of the ca triplet in halos and globular clusters .    from the very beginning ,",
    "studies of integrated light have sought to constrain the initial mass function ( imf ) in early type galaxies ( spinrad & taylor 1971 ) .",
    "disintegrating the light will strengthen the observational approach to this problem too .",
    "indices such as the wing - ford band ( wing & ford 1969 , wing , cohen & brault 1977 , van dokkum & conroy 2011 ) will be more sensitive to imf , when only main sequence light is analysed .",
    "barium lines are an indicator of @xmath0-process activity ( secondary nucleosynthesis ) in the earliest stars .",
    "ba ii 4554   has 77 m   equivalent width at ( t@xmath28 , g , [ fe / h ] ) = ( 6000 , 4 , 2 ) . the ratio of predicted equivalent widths at other effective temperatures is shown in figure 3 . with a 100 km",
    "/ s velocity dispersion this will be a 5% depression in the continuum of a metal poor main sequence spectrum .",
    "high signal - to - noise disaggregated spectra will be required .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show that @xmath0-process and @xmath27 elements are accessible to the technique described here and the temperature dependence of these line ratios is modest in the region which contributes most of the light .",
