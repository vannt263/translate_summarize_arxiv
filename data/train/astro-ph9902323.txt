    "the star changes from oxygen- to carbon - rich when sufficient carbon has been mixed - in with the stellar mantle to yield an abundance ratio c / o@xmath2 .",
    "the chemistry of the dust in the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) changes accordingly .",
    "the change occurs at smaller core - mass  or lower luminosity  for lower metallicity stars .",
    "clear evidence for this comes from observations of clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that contain both carbon and m - type stars ( lloyd evans 1984 ; marigo et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "surprisingly , silicate emission from oxygen - rich dust was discovered in the iras low resolution spectra of several galactic carbon stars ( little - marenin 1986 ; willems & de jong 1986 ) .",
    "willems & de jong interpreted these `` silicate carbon stars '' as direct evidence for a fast transition of m - type agb stars into carbon stars , but timescales of decades for the silicate emission from an expanding detached oxygen - rich cse to fade away are difficult to reconcile with the lifetimes of silicate carbon stars ( little - marenin et al .",
    "1987 ; le bertre et al .",
    "hence the oxygen - rich material must be stored in a stationary component .",
    "many galactic silicate carbon stars are @xmath3c - enhanced , j - type , carbon stars ( lambert et al .",
    "1990 ) . unlike genuine , n - type , carbon stars that form on the agb , j - type carbon stars",
    "are thought to have become carbon - enriched as a result of binary evolution .",
    "the presence of a mass - losing oxygen - rich companion star has been ruled out observationally for a number of galactic silicate carbon stars ( noguchi et al .",
    "1990 ; engels & leinert 1994 ) .",
    "the presently most supported explanation for the silicate carbon star phenomenon is that of a keplerian disk of oxygen - rich material , surrounding a binary including a faint companion ( lloyd evans 1990 ) . the oxygen - rich dust may originate from mass loss at a time when the carbon star was still oxygen rich ( lloyd evans 1990 ) .",
    "the dust - enshrouded agb star iras04496@xmath06958 was recently discovered to be a luminous carbon star in the lmc by van loon et al .",

    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this object peaks in the infrared . therefore in order to properly model the spectrum we obtained photometric and spectro - photometric observations with the european infrared space observatory ( iso , see kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) , using the isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) and isophot ( lemke et al .",
    "1996 ) instruments .",
    "the photometric observations at 12 @xmath4 m ( using isocam filter lw10 ) and 25 @xmath4 m ( using isophot ) were obtained on april 22 , 1996 .",
    "the 12 @xmath4 m observation was done using @xmath7 pixels , and a total on - source integration time of 50 s split in 25 two - s integration intervals .",
    "the 25 @xmath4 m isophot observation was done using the p2 detector , a @xmath8 aperture , and triangular chopping with a chopper throw of @xmath9 .",
    "the on - source integration time was 64 s. the 60 @xmath4 m photometry was obtained using the phot - c100 detector using two different methods .",
    "one observation ( april 22 , 1996 ) was done using chopping mode with triangular chops and a chopping angle of @xmath10 and an on - source integration time of 64 s. another observation ( april 1 , 1998 ) was done with a @xmath11 raster map with @xmath12 raster steps and an integration time per pointing of 128 s , giving an effective on - source integration time of @xmath13 s.    spectro - photometric observations of the source were obtained with isophot - s and the isocam cvf . the phot - s spectrum ( april 22 , 1996 )",
    "was done in staring mode with an on - source integration time of 512 s. two isocam cvf spectra were obtained . the first isocam spectrum ( june 5 , 1997 ,",
    "hereafter `` spectrum a '' ) spans the wavelength range from 7 to 14 @xmath4 m , the second ( april 1 , 1998 , hereafter `` spectrum b '' ) from 5 to 17 @xmath4 m .",
    "the @xmath14 pixel field of view was used , with an integration time per spectral point of 50 and 70 s , respectively .",
    "the data was processed using standard processing routines in the phot interactive analysis ( pia ) and cam interactive analysis ( cia ) software .",
    "the cam - cvf spectra were constructed using a @xmath11 pixel@xmath15 software aperture and applying a correction for the wavelength dependence of the point spread function .",
    "we corrected the phot - s spectrum for the background as derived from the cam - cvf data , accounting for the annual modulation of the zodiacal light using cobe / dirbe weekly all - sky maps ( see also trams et al .",
    "the photometric observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the iso observations are supplemented with ground - based j , h , k , and l - band observations made at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , interpolated to the same epochs as the various iso observations .",
    "the spectra are presented in fig",
    ".  1 . also plotted is a spectrum around 3 @xmath4 m obtained at ctio ( van loon et al .",
    "1999 ) , after scaling to match the approximate continuum level in the phot - s spectrum .",
    "we believe that the phot - s spectrum longward of @xmath16 @xmath4 m has been under - estimated , and possibly distorted , due to difficulties in determining the stabilised signal at such low flux density levels .",
    "the phot - s and ctio spectra show the strong 3 @xmath4 m feature from hcn and c@xmath17h@xmath17 ( fig .  1 ) , but the long wavelength part of the phot - s spectrum is rather noisy .",
    "the cam - cvf spectra , however , show a prominent emission feature between 9 and 12 @xmath4 m with a small dip near 11 @xmath4 m . for comparison we also plot in fig .",

    "( 1997 ) , which shows strong silicate emission from oxygen - rich dust around 10 @xmath4 m .",
    "the feature in iras04496@xmath06958 extends to longer wavelengths than in v778 cyg , and closely resembles that of another galactic silicate carbon star , cs1003 ( hen 83 , iras08002@xmath03803 ; see little - marenin 1986 and willems & de jong 1986 ) .",
    "we also plot in fig .",

    "( 1997 ) , which shows a prominent silicon carbide ( sic ) emission feature around @xmath20 m that is common in carbon stars ( see e.g.  little - marenin 1986 ; yamamura et al.1997 ) . the shape of the 9 - 12 @xmath4 m emission feature in iras04496@xmath06958 may be explained by assuming that the feature is a composition of the silicate and sic features .",
    "alternative explanations include large silicate grains ( forrest et al .",
    "1975 ; papoular & pgouri 1983 ) , crystalline olivines ( koike et al .  1981 ) and corundum ( alo ) grains ( onaka et al .  1989 ) .",
    "we note that similarly shaped emission is observed in the spectra of a wide variety of objects : the s star rt sco and ms stars ( little - marenin & little 1988 ) , the sil@xmath21 and sil@xmath22 classes of m - type mira variables ( little - marenin & little 1990 ) , @xmath23 pictoris ( knacke et al .",
    "1993 ; fajardo - acosta & knacke 1995 ) , inter - planetary dust particles ( sandford 1988 ) and comet halley ( campins & ryan 1989 ) .",
    "absorption against the photosphere by hcn and c@xmath17h@xmath17 is seen at 3.1 , 3.8 and 8 @xmath4 m ( fig .  1 ) . on the long - wavelength end of the emission feature the 13.7 @xmath4 m absorption due to c@xmath17h@xmath17",
    "is seen , which is commonly observed in the spectra of galactic carbon stars ( yamamura et al .",
    "this absorption is seen against the dust continuum  that dominates over the photospheric continuum at these long wavelengths  indicating that the molecules are abundant throughout the dusty cse .",
    "it is absent in v778 cyg .",
    "this may be understood if the molecules - to - dust ratio is larger at lower metallicity , possibly because depletion of molecules into dust grains is less severe at smaller dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "iras04496@xmath06958 is a long period variable with a period of @xmath24 d and a k - band amplitude of @xmath25 mag ( whitelock et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the two cvf spectra are taken at different phases in the lightcurve , with spectrum a closer to maximum light .",
    "their ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "the maximum difference is reached between 9 and 10 @xmath4 m , and no difference is seen for wavelengths @xmath26 @xmath4 m .",
    "this suggests that a significant part of the variability around 10 @xmath4 m is due to a variable emission feature , whilst beyond 13 @xmath4 m non - variable dust continuum emission dominates .",
    "the cvf ratio around 10 @xmath4 m is 1.2 , which equals the ratio of l - band flux densities at these two epochs ( the k - band flux density ratio is 1.5 ) .",
    "this may be compared to n- ( 10 @xmath4 m ) and l - band amplitudes observed in galactic ir - bright carbon stars , @xmath27 mag ( standard deviation 0.23 ) ( le bertre 1992 ) , and oxygen stars , @xmath28 mag ( standard deviation 0.20 ) ( le bertre 1993 ) .",
    "the difference results from the fact that in carbon stars the l - band includes variable hcn+c@xmath17h@xmath17 absorption , whereas in oxygen stars the n - band includes variable silicate emission .",
    "the @xmath29 mag of iras04496@xmath06958 suggests a contribution of silicate emission to the variability in the n - band .",
    "the 10 @xmath4 m variability of iras04496@xmath06958 is additional evidence for the silicate carbon star nature of this star , and 10 @xmath4 m variability might provide a new means for finding or confirming silicate carbon stars .",
    "all ir colours between 1 and 25 @xmath4 m of iras04496@xmath06958 are similar to those of carbon stars ( van loon et al .",
    "1998 ; trams et al .  1999 ) , whereas v778 cyg has colours ( chen et al .",
    "1998 ) more similar to oxygen - rich stars .",
    "hence the oxygen - rich dust component represents only a minor fraction of the total dust mass that is contained in the cse of iras04496@xmath06958 .",
    "its cse is considerably thicker than that of known galactic silicate carbon stars , judged from its very red near - ir colours ( lloyd evans 1990 ; chan & kwok 1991 ) .",
    "hence the observation that all galactic silicate carbon stars are of j - type ( lambert et al .  1990 ) may be an observational bias against n - type carbon stars with massive carbon - rich cses for which an optical spectrum to determine the @xmath3c/@xmath30c ratio is relatively difficult to obtain .",
    "[ [ the - origin - of - the - oxygen - rich - dust - around - the - carbon - star - iras04496 - 6958 ] ] the origin of the oxygen - rich dust around the carbon star iras04496@xmath06958 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    iras04496@xmath06958 is special because with @xmath31 mag it is a very luminous carbon star ( van loon et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the popular scenario for the formation of silicate carbon stars in which a j - type carbon star evolves from a less massive r - type star ( lambert et al .",
    "1990 ) implies that silicate carbon stars should not be very luminous , which has some observational support ( barnbaum et al .",
    "therefore , iras04496@xmath06958 could be a different class from the galactic silicate carbon stars .",
    "nuclear burning at the base of the convective envelope ( `` hot bottom burning '' , hbb ) reduces the carbon abundance of the mantle by cycling it into nitrogen ( iben 1981 ; iben & renzini 1983 ; wood et al .",
    "theoretical models show that it occurs for the most massive agb stars ( blcker & schnberner 1991 ) .",
    "boothroyd et al .",
    "( 1993 ) predict that hbb prevents the occurence of carbon stars above m@xmath32 mag , consistent with the observed absence of optically bright carbon stars more luminous than m@xmath33 mag ( iben 1981 ; costa & frogel 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of luminous dust - enshrouded carbon stars ( van loon et al .  1999 ) like iras04496@xmath06958 in the lmc and iras00350@xmath07436 in the smc ( @xmath34 mag ; whitelock et al .",
    "1989 ) is explained by mass loss reducing the stellar mantle to below a critical mass required for the pressure and temperature at the lower convective boundary to be sufficiently high to support hbb ( boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ) .",
    "if such a star experiences another thermal pulse and accompanying dredge - up of carbon to its surface , it may become a carbon star , after all ( frost et al .",
    "1998 ; marigo et al .",
    "1998 ) . hence , iras04496@xmath06958 has been an oxygen - rich star not longer than a thermal pulse interval of @xmath35 yr ago ( see vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that emission from the oxygen - rich dust is still observable around the recently formed carbon star , but the massive carbon - rich cse around iras04496@xmath06958 suggests a relatively long lapse of time since the mass loss was oxygen rich . although the isophot 60 @xmath4 m photometry is rather inaccurate , the high 60 @xmath4 m flux density of iras04496@xmath06958 suggest that its mass - loss rate was higher in the past , some @xmath36 yr ago , which would be consistent with an episode of increased mass loss during a thermal pulse followed by a considerable period of mass loss at a more moderate rate .    hence it remains to be seen whether the silicate carbon star nature of iras04496@xmath06958 requires a companion star to have captured the oxygen - rich material in a circumbinary disk , or whether it resulted from single star evolution of a massive agb star .",
