    "precise knowledge of variability in @xmath0ray fluxes observed from various emitters is considered essential for putting constraints on their intrinsic properties . among the most peculiar sources of such variable emission",
    "are the binary systems .",
    "so far , only five @xmath0ray binaries have been detected  @xcite . out of these ,",
    "four are known to emit very high energetic ( vhe ) @xmath0rays in the tev energy domain .",
    "all five binaries were recognized as high  mass systems emitting in x - ray band composed of a massive star of o or be type and a compact object orbiting around it  @xcite . except for psr",
    "b125963 consisting out of an orbiting couple of be star and a pulsar  @xcite , the nature of the compact object in other binaries , either a neutron star or a black hole , is unclear .",
    "one of two most prominent acceleration mechanisms currently believed to take place in the binary systems assumes acceleration of charged particles in relativistic jets as a result of accretion onto a massive object like a black hole  @xcite .",
    "the other scenario involves the outflow of relativistic particles from a pulsar .",
    "subsequent @xmath0ray emission processes may include synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering of relativistic particles off the ambient photon population .",
    "studies of variability patterns of @xmath0ray binaries might provide valuable information on radiation processes in these systems . besides that",
    ", proper investigation of data is needed as the nature of the variability itself is also not evident .",
    "this is due to the fact that the orbital motion of objects can cause a periodic modulation of the observed flux without any intrinsic variability of sources  @xcite .",
    "development of @xmath0astronomy in the past decade has brought a strong demand for reliable and precise statistical method for variability studies .",
    "various methods are used for investigation of temporal changes of @xmath0ray intensities observed by different instruments .",
    "usually , photon fluxes are determined first and their overall trend is then analysed .",
    "fit to a constant is often performed together with a subsequent check whether the residual sum of squares for fluxes is drawn from the @xmath1 distribution , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "variability index is also used to examine changes in the lightcurves ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is derived as the maximum likelihood ratio for different hypotheses , namely those of the flux constant throughout the whole observational period and of the flux optimized in each time bin  @xcite .",
    "other techniques , for example , bayesian blocks  based method  @xcite , attempt to recognise change points in the lightcurves , for application see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the list of used methods is not exhaustive ; however , it demonstrates the wide range of different approaches to the problem of time variability in @xmath0ray astrophysics .",
    "development of @xmath0astronomy in the past decade has brought a strong demand for reliable and precise statistical method for variability studies .",
    "future improvement in the experimental techniques will provide us with vast amount of data on various transient phenomena with better temporal resolution .",
    "in particular , one of the goals of the next generation of imaging atmospheric telescopes , the cherenkov telescope array  @xcite , will be extensive studies of the @xmath0ray binaries  @xcite .",
    "time variability of intrinsic activities of not only these @xmath0ray emitters will be a crucial question in most analyses , for which our modification @xcite of the on  off method  @xcite could be useful .",
    "our modification of the on  off method  @xcite aims to determine a level of significance for an excess or deficit of counts in individual measurements when compared to the reference source intensity previously ascertained from other observations  @xcite . in the on  off method there is no demand for the calculation of the flux or other quantities .",
    "it works only with the numbers of events detected in the on  source and reference off  source region provided that their exposures are known .",
    "the method is equally suitable for any observations regardless of the experimental technique , thus making the comparison of data detected by different instruments possible .",
    "it allows to check for intensity changes in the ranges of times , energies or zenith angles , for example , as long as reasonable estimates for the source intensity exist .",
    "we use this technique to examine whether the @xmath0ray binary hess  j0632 + 057  exhibits any temporal changes in the numbers of @xmath0ray events measured from its direction .",
    "ma method is widely used in vhe @xmath0ray astronomy for determining a level of significance of a photon excess above background when validating the source presence in a given region @xcite . in this method",
    ", one assumes the test of the null hypothesis stating that there is no source present in the investigated on  source region .",
    "the on  source region encompasses the potential @xmath0ray emitter whereas the off  source region is considered to be free of point sources and thus suitable for the background estimation . in order to account for different extent ( e.g.  temporal or spatial ) and unequal observing conditions of both regions , an on  off parameter @xmath2 , the ratio of the on and off  source exposures , is needed .",
    "a straightforward modification of this technique allows one to estimate the significance of an excess or deficit of the number of events when compared to the known source activity @xcite .",
    "the modified on  off method assumes that the @xmath0ray emitter has already been positively identified in the potential hotspot .",
    "a source parameter @xmath3 is introduced to characterize its intensity .",
    "then the statement of the null hypothesis is that the source attains intensity of previously chosen value @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath5  @xcite , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the numbers of events detected in the on and off  source regions , respectively .",
    "taking the source parameter @xmath4 being equal to unity one recovers the original no  source assumption .",
    "alternatively , the inequality expresses that an excess of counts above the source intensity will be tested while implies the test of their deficit .",
    "a level of significance for the rejection of the no  source assumption is given in terms of li  ma statistics @xcite .",
    "a modification of the original significance formula ( eq .  17 in @xcite ) for the assumption of the constant source intensity leads to a similar equation , the only difference being the transformation @xmath8 @xcite , i.e. @xmath9 } + { n_{\\mathrm{off}}}\\ln{\\left [ ( 1+\\alpha\\beta ) \\frac{{n_{\\mathrm{off}}}}{{n_{\\mathrm{on}}}+ { n_{\\mathrm{off } } } } \\right ] } \\right\\rbrace^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] the @xmath10term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lima ] ) ( @xmath11 ) accounts merely for the sign of the whole expression , depending whether an excess ( @xmath12 ) or deficit ( @xmath13 ) of events is observed .",
    "given a set of observations the li ",
    "ma statistics can be evaluated in each individual case for different values of the source parameter @xmath4 chosen in advance at one s discretion .",
    "based on the @xmath14 values , one can infer whether measured data disagree with the null hypotheses given by various benchmark values of @xmath4 . since the source intensity is not given in advance the source parameter @xmath4 , by which it is represented ,",
    "is essentially free .",
    "thus , in addition to the test of the hypothesis of chosen source intensity , the li ",
    "ma statistics can be harnessed to derive confidence intervals from an observed set of data at a given level of significance .",
    "series of such confidence intervals provides a powerful tool for examination of the progress of the source @xmath0ray activity in time .",
    "we studied temporal evolution of the observed vhe @xmath0ray intensity from a @xmath0ray binary system hess  j0632 + 057   using the modified on  off method . in our calculations",
    "we used publicly available data obtained by experiments employing the cherenkov telescopes .",
    "in particular , we utilized those measurements where the number of detected on and off  source events , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the on  off parameter @xmath2 for different periods of time are presented . given the values of these quantities determined by the experiment the only remaining quantity left in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lima ] ) is the source intensity expressed by the source parameter @xmath4 .    in the following sections ,",
    "our results are visualized in plots showing a sequence of confidence intervals , @xmath15 , arranged in a chosen time order . in these plots ,",
    "non  overlapping confidence intervals are thought to represent exceptional measurements of source counts revealing emission or absorption features in the overall lightcurve . for each triplet",
    "@xmath16 , confidence intervals for the source parameter @xmath4 were determined numerically such that the li  ma significance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lima ] ) satisfies @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is chosen critical value of a confidence level .",
    "the span of confidence intervals is driven by the number of detected events .",
    "firmer restrictions on the source parameter are obtained for larger numbers of events .",
    "we also determined benchmark estimates of the source parameter @xmath4 derived as average values of the ratio of observed and expected on  source events over individual time intervals , i.e.  @xmath19 .",
    "confidence intervals for the source parameter @xmath4 of the @xmath0ray binary hess  j0632 + 057  @xcite are shown as a function of modified julian date .",

    "the numbers of events registered in individual measurements were less than thirty in the on  source region and in the range of several tens to two hundred in the off  source regions .",
    "the source was detected above the energy threshold of @xmath23  gev at a @xmath24 level of significance deduced from the total observational live time of 144 hours .",
    "the @xmath0ray binary was also a target of the 20042012 observations of the hess telescope system  @xcite . with the exception of one observational period",
    ", all measurements yielded the numbers of detected events ranging from over ten to several hundred .",
    "the hess collaboration claimed detection of the source above the energy @xmath25  gev at a @xmath26 level of significance inferred from 53.5 hours of live time observations .",
    "combined results of both experiments point to the repetitive variability patterns of the integral @xmath0ray flux .",
    "calculation of the variability index  @xcite showed that the overall lightcurve is different from a constant at a @xmath27 level of significance  @xcite .    in our calculations",
    ", we used the data gathered by the veritas and hess collaborations from table  1 in  @xcite .",
    "data from individual observational epochs do not come from longer time periods than one month .",
    "[ fig : j0632_mjd ] shows confidence intervals for the source parameter  @xmath4 at a @xmath28 level of significance together with values @xmath20 determined for each measurement .",
    "confidence intervals are ordered chronologically according to the modified julian date of observations . in fig .",

    ", none of the measurements result in extraordinary values of the source parameter with respect to the others . on the other hand ,",

    "ma significances for the test of the null hypothesis given by the average source parameter @xmath29 ascertained from the whole set of observations are @xmath30 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the @xmath0ray intensity of the binary system hess  j0632 + 057   can not be considered steady at least on time scales of months in accord with @xcite .    in order to examine the evolution of the source activity due to the orbital motion of the compact object around",
    "star , we folded the numbers of on and off  source counts with the period of 315 days .",
    "the orbital period was derived by  @xcite using the results of measurements by the swift satellite which resolved recurring features in the x  ray lightcurve .",
    "phase 0 was set as @xmath31 , corresponding to first swift observations .",

    "[ fig : j0632_phase ] .",
    "the choice of the level of significance in fig .",
    "[ fig : j0632_phase ] was motivated by the comparison with the similar plot for fluxes in  @xcite where @xmath32 statistical uncertainties were depicted .",
    "several confidence intervals obtained from veritas data around phases @xmath33 do not overlap with the remaining ones .",
    "this distinctive rise in the hess  j0632 + 057  @xmath0ray activity correlates with an increase in intensity visible in the sequence of confidence intervals obtained using the hess data .",
    "possibly enhanced emission might be emerging at phases @xmath34 .",
    "the phase folded x  ray flux measured by swift exhibits a double  peak structure with a prominent maximum around phases @xmath35 and a secondary peak of about half the size of the main one at phases @xmath36  @xcite . besides these periods of increased emission , a clear dip can be recognized at phases @xmath37 suggesting that either an absorption process or a termination of particle acceleration is taking place during the particular arrangement of the massive object and its companion star  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of confidence intervals for the @xmath0ray intensity reveals a presence of a peak consistent with the one observed at phases @xmath35 in the x  ray band . in agreement with the analysis of variability of the integral flux with @xmath32 uncertainties done by the veritas and hess collaborations  @xcite , hints of increased vhe activity around the position of the second x ",
    "ray peak arise in our approach for the 68% confidence intervals .",
    "however , we did not find any significant inconsistency in the sequence of confidence intervals at a @xmath28 level of significance deduced from the hess observations , which cover the inspected range of phases .",
    "neither did we reveal any signs of absorption of the @xmath0rays .",
    "temporal changes in the observed @xmath0ray intensities of the binary hess  j0632 + 057   were studied by the means of the modified on  off method with the emphasis put on its usefulness in the analyses of data gathered by cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the assumption of the constant source activity was ruled out consistently with the previous findings on time variability of the binary system  @xcite .",
    "the correlation of the vhe @xmath0ray activity with the observations in the x  ray energy band was verified at least in terms of the regularity of emission and increased activity at particular phases .",
    "the use of the modified on  off scheme is justified by a strong statistical motivation as well as its straightforward application , while remaining sufficiently general at the same time .",
    "absence of any need for complex calculation of fluxes in the modified on  off method makes it a convenient choice for investigation of observed intensity variations in vhe @xmath0astronomy .",
