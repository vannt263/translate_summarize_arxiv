    "simultaneous ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering   belongs to the class of multiferroic materials , which may become very interesting for possible future applications .",
    "our previous theoretical analysis of the physical mechanisms of magnetic anisotropy in  @xcite , hereafter referred as paper i , was inspired by recent , unexpected results of magnetization and ferromagnetic resonance experiments which clearly showed that the easy axis of magnetization in thin layers of , for the manganese content of about 10 at .",
    "% , is perpendicular to the layer @xcite . in ferromagnetic thin layers the shape anisotropy usually dominates with easy magnetization axis located in the layer plane .",
    "this is indeed observed in  layers for higher content of manganese , above 20  at .",
    "% . for these layers",
    "the x - ray diffraction analysis ( xrd ) shows that the increase of mn content results in transition from rhombohedral to cubic ( rock - salt ) crystal structure .",
    "in the paper i we performed extensive _",
    "ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) in .",
    "the aim was to elucidate microscopic mechanisms responsible for the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "we concluded that the main contribution to mae is given by the spin polarization induced in te and ge neighbors of mn , and not by the mn ions themselves .",
    "the mn spin polarizes its neighborhood , the spins of ge ions are approximately parallel and the spins of te ions approximately antiparallel to the direction of the mn spin . the degree and",
    "the spatial range of spin polarization is relatively small in insulating crystal but it strongly grows with the increasing concentration of holes . because of spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction , the directions of te and ge spins forced by the direction of mn spin do not , in general , correspond to minimum of the total energy of the system .",
    "this forcing of ge and te polarizations by the mn spin is the principal reason why variations of the directions of mn spins result in changes of the total energy .",
    "apart from the identification of the main physical mechanism responsible for magnetic anisotropy we also showed that mae is determined by the hole concentration , macroscopic crystal structure , and the local configuration of mn .",
    "the paper i was devoted almost exclusively to the situations where there was only one mn ion in @xmath8 rhombohedral supercell containing 64 atoms . in all cases , the angular dependence of mae on the mn spin direction characterized by the angle @xmath9",
    "was well approximated by the formula @xmath10 here @xmath9 is the angle measured in the ( -110 ) plane from the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "thus , for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the mn spin is parallel to [ 111 ] and to the [ 11 - 2 ] crystallographic directions , respectively .",
    "the same definition of @xmath9 is used in the present paper .",
    "one should keep in mind that a supercell containing one mn ion simulates perfect , translationally invariant crystal with rhombohedral symmetry . in actual random substitutional alloys ,",
    "this symmetry is locally destroyed .",
    "although macroscopic structural , mechanical , electrical or magnetic properties can have the global rhombohedral symmetry as confirmed by xrd , at the unit cell scale this symmetry is destroyed .",
    "this is due to the randomness of the occupancies of lattice sites in the chemically mixed cation sublattice ( which is sometimes called chemical disorder ) , and to the presence of native defects , in our case the cation vacancies",
    ". the random positions of manganese ions together with different ionic radii of ge and mn lead to local deformation of the lattice .",
    "the local deformations are also caused by the germanium vacancies .",
    "each cation vacancy , like in other iv - vi semiconductors , delivers two holes , thus in real sample with the hole concentration of the order @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 we expect @xmath15  @xmath14 of vacancies . for comparison , the mn concentration @xmath16 corresponds to about @xmath17 of mn ions per cubic centimeter .",
    "the influence of the chemical disorder on the magnetic anisotropy in  is the topic of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we analyze the single ion magnetic anisotropy ( sima ) in . in the paper",
    "i we explicitly showed that sima in the conducting , is of minor importance compared to the anisotropy caused by spin polarized free carriers .",
    "however , the calculations were performed for systems with manganese ion s neighbourhood of perfect rhombohedral symmetry . on the other hand",
    "it is well known from numerous electron paramagnetic resonance experiments ( epr ) that the ground state splittings and consequently magnetic anisotropy properties of mn@xmath6 ion strongly depend on the symmetry of its surrounding .",
    "previous calculations performed for  and  show that the ground state splitting of mn@xmath6 ion in disordered environment may be of the order of 1 kelvin . because the difference in ionic radii of ge and mn is much smaller than that of pb and mn , the local lattice distortions ( which strongly influence the magnetic properties of mn ) are also smaller .",
    "thus , we do not expect that sima driven by the microscopic lattice distortions are dominant in . on the other hand ,",
    "the band structure of gete is significantly different from those of other iv - vi semiconductors due to ferroelectric properties of the crystal .",
    "that is why direct calculations of sima in  are necessary .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly describe mechanism responsible for sima and the method of calculations .",
    "the obtained results confirm that even in the presence of disorder , in conducting  sima is of secondary importance .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents results of _ ab initio _ calculations of mae of pairs of mn ions in .",
    "all nonequivalent positions of two mn in the @xmath18 supercell are taken into account .",
    "we also show a few results for three mn ions in the supercell . in the calculations",
    "the spins of mn ions are always parallel .",
    "this is justified , because according to the results of section ii the energies connected with local magnetic anisotropy easy axes are small , and in the first approximation the possible noncollinearity of mn spins can be neglected .",
    "we explicitly show that the direction of easy axis of magnetization strongly depends on the relative position of mn ions , and mae is not described by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . for chosen two configurations of two manganese ions we analyze contributions of kinetic , electrostatic and exchange - correlation energies to mae .",
    "it is shown that the mn ions introduced to gete causes significant perturbation in spatial distribution of electron charge and , consequently , significant change of electrostatic potential which , via the s - o interaction , influences mae .    in section [ sec4 ] we summarize the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "according to the hund s rule , the ground state of mn@xmath6 ion is @xmath19 , with the orbital momentum @xmath20 and spin @xmath21 . as the orbital singlet",
    ", it does not interact with the crystal environment , and its ground state without external magnetic field is six - fold degenerate .",
    "this model of mn@xmath6 ion explains a number of phenomena , e.g. , the results of magnetization measurements in diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "however , if we consider problems in which very small excitation energies are of importance , this model is no longer valid .",
    "an example of such a problem is the splitting of the ground state of mn ion in a crystal field measured in epr experiments . in the theoretical analysis for zero magnetic field ,",
    "the mn@xmath6 ion is described by a @xmath22 matrix , @xmath23 , which plays a role of effective spin hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the subscripts @xmath24 denote the projections of mn spin on the quantization axis .",
    "for example , for a perfect cubic symmetry of mn surrounding @xmath25 the lowest excitation energies of the ion ( i.e. , the eigenvalues of @xmath23 ) strongly depend on the symmetry of its neighborhood , and are in the range @xmath26  k. if the hamiltonian @xmath23 is not diagonal , it leads not only to the ground state splitting but also to the magnetic anisotropy of the ion @xcite .",
    "+ density functional theory , which is one of the basic theoretical methods used to study condensed matter properties , is not suitable for this problem because dft calculations determine the electron density in the ground state , and provide no direct information about the excited states of the system , particularly in situations where the energies of the excited states are very small . in this case",
    "one should use methods based on perturbation theory .",
    "there are two mechanisms known in the literature which lead to the ground state splitting : interaction with excited states of @xmath27 configuration , and hybridization between @xmath28 and orbitals of the surrounding ions . in the first mechanism @xcite the internal manganese s - o interaction couples @xmath19 with the excited @xmath29 states , due to which the ground state of mn is no longer a pure @xmath30 state with total angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the interaction with the crystal environment becomes possible . as a result ,",
    "ground state splitting and nondiagonal effective hamiltonian @xmath23 are finite .    in dms ,",
    "the second mechanism , i.e. , the hybridization between @xmath28(mn ) orbitals and the orbitals of the neighboring ions , plays a more important role . in this case , a system consisting of @xmath28(mn ) electrons and valence band carriers is considered . in the ground state of this system , which is six - fold degenerate due to manganese spin @xmath21 ,",
    "there are five electrons on the @xmath28 shell and the host bands are filled up to the fermi energy . in the excited state ,",
    "one electron is transferred from the host band to the @xmath28 shell ( or from the @xmath28 shell to the band ) resulting in one additional hole ( or electron ) in the host bands , respectively .",
    "such virtual transfers of electron were used earlier in theories of @xmath31 exchange interaction in semiconductors @xcite . as a consequence of this @xmath28 shell - band states hybridization",
    ", the ground state of the system is no longer six fold degenerate , and the resulting low energy excitation spectrum and the anisotropic properties of the ion take place , in accord with experimental observations .",
    "this mechanism was described in ref .",
    "@xcite and successfully applied to epr results for pbte : mn layers grown on baf@xmath32 and kcl substrates @xcite , to the single ion anisotropy in   mixed crystals @xcite and to the analysis of magnetic specific heat in  @xcite .",
    "this method is also used in the present paper for calculations of effective spin hamiltonian . here",
    ", we do not repeat detailed description of the method and formulas contained in ref .",
    "@xcite but sketch only the main idea of calculations .",
    "we consider gete crystal at the temperature @xmath33 with one germanium atom replaced by manganese atom .",
    "it is assumed that this replacement does not change appreciably neither the band structure nor the spatial electron distribution .",
    "the only difference comparing to the pure gete is the presence of additional @xmath28 shell on one of the cation places with five electrons on it .",
    "if we neglect hybridization between @xmath28 orbitals and the orbitals of the neighbouring atoms , in the ground state of such a system there are five electrons on @xmath28 shell , and free electrons fill the band states up to the fermi energy .",
    "this ground state is sixfold degenerate due to the total spin @xmath21 of the @xmath28 shell . in the excited states of the system",
    "one electron is transferred from @xmath28 shell to an unoccupied band state , or one electron from the band is transferred to the @xmath28 shell .",
    "such transfers require excitation energy denoted by @xmath34 , which will be the only fitting parameter for comparison of mae given by the effective hamiltonian with the dft results .    in the excited states there are four or six electrons on the @xmath28 shell , and according to the hund",
    "s rule their total angular momentum @xmath35 and the total spin @xmath36 .",
    "due to nonzero total angular momentum , in the excited states the internal mn spin - orbit coupling @xmath37 should be taken into account .",
    "the inclusion of the internal s - o coupling is crucial for the splitting of the ground state and magnetic anisotropy properties of the ion , otherwise the ground state is not split , independently whether the band spin - orbit coupling is present or not .    in the hamiltonian of the system",
    "the ground and excited states are connected by hybridization between @xmath28(mn ) orbitals and orbitals of neighbouring te ions .",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian for the ground state is calculated within the framework of the second order perturbation theory for degenerate spectra with respect to hybridization .",
    "the main differences between the present calculations and those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for  are related to the tight binding model of the band structure and to the hybridization parameters between @xmath28 states of mn ion and the orbitals of neighboring te ions used in calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered mn ion in pbte using the tight binding model that takes into account nearest cation - anion neighbors and nearest and next nearest cation - cation and anion - anion neighbors .",
    "the model was parametrized according to ref .",
    "the integrals describing hybridization mn @xmath28 -te orbitals were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the tight binding model takes into account integrals up to the third neighbour , and their values were taken from dft calculations for gete as the matrix elements of kohn  sham hamiltonian between pseudoatomic orbitals of ge and te . using _",
    "ab initio _ openmx package @xcite",
    "we performed calculations for both fully relativistic and scalar relativistic pseudopotentials .",
    "thus , we can compare effective spin hamiltonian obtained for situations with and without the band spin - orbit interaction .    from dft calculations performed for @xmath38 supercell containing 64 atoms with one",

    "to determine the energy @xmath34 , i.  e. the energy necessary to transfer an electron between the @xmath28 shell and the top of the valence band , we performed scalar relativistic calculations for gete .",
    "next , using the tight binding parameters from the obtained kohn - sham hamiltonian we calculated the effective spin hamiltonian and the angular dependence of mae , @xmath44 , for for hole concentrations @xmath59 and @xmath58  @xmath14 for different values of @xmath34 .",
    "the results were compared to mae obtained from dft calculations for 64-atom supercell containing one mn ion for vanishing s - o coupling for ge and te atoms .",
    "such a comparison makes sense only when the band spin - orbit interaction is neglected because , as we know from paper i , only in such a case mae is due to mn ion and does not depend on the direction of spin polarization of ge and te ions . from dft calculations we obtain @xmath60  k and @xmath61  k for insulating and conducting cases , respectively . to obtain these values by the effective hamiltonian method we must assume @xmath34=2.92  ev for the insulating , and @xmath34=2.58  ev for the conducting cases , respectively , see the fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] ]    angular dependencies for the kinetic , electrostatic and exchange - correlation components of mae are shown in fig .",
    "their nonconstant angular dependencies prove that the spatial charge distribution varies with the mn spin s direction .",
    "two features may be noticed .",
    "first , the changes of kinetic , electrostatic and exchange - correlation energies with the direction of manganese spins are much larger than the changes of their sum , the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "however this is usual in dft calculations - the dependence of components of the total energy on external parameters is much stronger than the dependence of the total energy itself .",
    "the other feature is more interesting .",
    "let us notice that the maxima and minima of components are placed in different positions than the maxima and minima of mae .",
    "this was not the case for single manganese ion in a supercell considered in the paper i where the maxima or minima for all curves were at the same positions .",
    "this shows , even more expressively than in the paper i , the close relationship between spin direction of manganese ions and the spatial distribution of electron charge . the changes of spatial charge density are caused by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in this work , we theoretically analyzed the influence of chemical disorder on magnetic anisotropy in ferromagnetic   semiconductor layers known to undergo ferroelectric structural distortion of rhombohedral crystal lattice and exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . using dft method we determined the local crystal structure in   substitutional solid solution and calculated the single ion contribution to magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "our calculation revealed that the single ion contribution is order of magnitude smaller than the contribution originating from spin polarization induced by mn ions into neighboring te and ge ions .",
    "this effect results from the hybridization of magnetic @xmath28 orbitals of mn ions and valence band states of gete subject to spin - orbit interactions @xcite .",
    "we also discussed magnetic anisotropy effects due to pairs of mn ions differently allocated in the supercell and showed that the spatial averaging over the chemical disorder strongly reduces the strength of this magnetic anisotropy mechanism and restores the global rhombohedral symmetry of magnetic system .",

    "<S> we theoretically analyze the influence of chemical disorder on magnetic anisotropy in   semiconductor layers known to exhibit carrier - induced ferromagnetism and ferroelectric distortion of rhombohedral crystal lattice . using dft method we determine the local changes in the crystal structure due to mn ions substitution for ge and due to the presence in  of very high concentration of cation vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the effect of this structural and chemical disorder on single ion magnetic anisotropy mechanism and show that its contribution is order of magnitude smaller as compared to magnetic anisotropy mechanism originating from the spin polarization induced by mn ions into neighboring te and ge ions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss magnetic anisotropy effects due to pairs of mn ions differently allocated in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial averaging over chemical disorder strongly reduces the strength of this magnetic anisotropy mechanism and restores the global rhombohedral symmetry of magnetic system .    </S>",
