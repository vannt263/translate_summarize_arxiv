    "a classic picture of low - mass star formation has been described in @xcite . during the collapse , a parsec - scale molecular clump fragments into gaseous cores that subsequently collapse and fragment to condensations which eventually form individual or a group of stars .",
    "after the formation of an accretion disk , a bipolar wind develops to shed angular momentum in the disk so that circumstellar matter can accrete onto the protostar .",
    "interactions between such a wind and the ambient molecular cloud may produce highly collimated molecular outflows ( or `` molecular jets '' ) at parsec scales @xcite .",
    "massive protostars are often found embedded in massive molecular clumps of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "their presence is marked by high luminosity ( @xmath15 ) , copious spectra from organic molecules @xcite , active accretion @xcite , and strong molecular outflows @xcite .",

    "do cores harboring massive young stellar objects collect all the mass before the formation of a protostar ?",
    "these questions can potentially be addressed by studying massive infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) .",
    "irdcs are dense ( @xmath163 ) and cold ( @xmath17k ) molecular clouds that absorb galactic background mid - infrared emission while emit at longer wavelengths ( @xmath18 100 ) .",
    "because of their extreme properties , irdcs are ideal laboratories to study the early stages of star formation , and thus have been subjected to intense studies since their identification in mid-1990s by the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ and the _ midcourse space experiment _",

    "@xcite , revealing more than 10,000 irdcs . among them , the ones with masses of @xmath14  and luminosities @xmath19 are candidates of massive star formation at a stage prior to the high mass protostellar phase .",
    "g28.34 + 0.06 ( hereafter g28.34 ) , one of the first recognized and well studied irdcs @xcite , appears to be a candidate to form massive stars .",

    "two prominent dust clumps , p1 and p2 , are revealed from dust continuum images obtained from single dish telescopes @xcite .",
    "large amount of dense gas ( @xmath2  within @xmath21pc ) makes p1 and p2 potential sites of protostellar cluster formation .",
    "@xcite observed p1 and p2 with the sma at 230ghz band .",
    "they found that , despite similar amount of dense gas contained in the two clumps , p1 and p2 show very different stages of evolution . at a @xmath22 resolution , the northern clump p2 fragments to two compact cores with masses 49 and 97 , respectively .",
    "the cores emit rich organic molecular line emissions analogous to that observed in hot cores .",
    "the southern clump p1 , on the other hand , fragments to a string of five cores regularly spaced along the ir - dark ridge , with masses of 2264 .",
    "in contrast to the cores in p2 , the p1 cores show no molecular line emission except faint co(21 ) across the entire 4ghz sma band . this implies a significant co depletion at a scale over 0.07pc in the p1 cores .",
    "in addition , an enhancement of deuterium fractionation was also found toward p1 @xcite .",
    "all these properties point p1 to a quiescent stage much earlier than p2 .",
    "however , strong h@xmath23o maser @xcite and enhanced 4.5  emission (  green fuzzy  ; * ? ? ?",

    "there are different definitions of clump , core , and condensation in the literature when describing the spatial structure of dust continuum or molecular line emission . in the following discussion",
    ", we refer a clump as a structure with a size of @xmath4 pc , a core as a structure with a size of @xmath5 pc , and a condensation as a substructure of @xmath32 pc within a core .",
    "a clump is capable of forming a cluster of stars , a core may form one or a small group of stars , and a condensation can typically form a single star or a multiple - star system .",
    "this nomenclature is consistent with the one adopted by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cont ] presents the 0.88 mm continuum emission .",
    "the @xmath33 resolution image resolves the clump into five groups of compact condensations , corresponding to the five dust cores discovered at 1.3 mm , namely sma1 , sma2 , sma3 , sma4 , and sma5 @xcite . cores sma1 , sma3 , and sma5 consist of one condensation .",
    "cores sma2 and sma4 consist of three condensations , with one dominating over the other two in peak flux .",
    "in addition , a faint condensation is also revealed northeast to core sma2 .",
    "we tentatively assign this condensation to the sma2 group .",
    "we name all the 10 condensations accordingly and label them on fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] .",
    "refining the core positions using the positions of the dominant condensations , the five cores are spaced by an projected distance of @xmath34pc ( @xmath35 ) , and are well aligned at a position angle ( pa , east of north ) of 48@xmath3 . in cores sma2 and sma4 , the three condensations are spaced by @xmath36pc ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we estimate the mass of each condensation .",
    "assuming optically thin dust emission , the dust mass can be estimated following @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dust mass , @xmath40 is the continuum flux at frequency @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the source distance , @xmath43 is the planck function at dust temperature @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xmath46g@xmath9 is the dust opacity @xcite . we adopt the dust temperatures from @xcite , i.e. , 16k for sma2 and 13k for other cores .",
    "the dust opacity at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths is uncertain . for dust in the interstellar medium , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath48 for the entire p1 clump based on a global spectral energy distribution .",
    "we generated a dust opacity map by comparing the continuum image at 345 ghz and 230 ghz , and found @xmath49 to vary from 1.3 to 2.5 across the map .",
    "given the uncertainties , we adopt @xmath50 for all the cores similar to @xcite , and discuss the effect of different @xmath49 on the mass estimates .    table [ tab : cores ] lists coordinates , size , peak flux , integrated flux , and estimated mass of all the 10 condensations .",
    "these parameters are determined by fitting a two dimensional gaussian function to the observed flux distribution .",
    "fluxes are then corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "the masses of the condensations range from 1.4 to 10.6  with an average of 4.8 .",
    "the mean size is @xmath51 , or @xmath52 after deconvolved with the synthesized beam .",
    "the deconvolved size corresponds to about @xmath53au at the source distance .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass estimation arises from several factors .",
    "first , the flux calibration contributes 15% in uncertainty .",
    "second , the uncertainty of @xmath49 contributes in a form of @xmath54 .",
    "third , the spatial filtering effect of radio interferometry preferentially picks up the compact structures and filters out the extended emission . comparing images made from different array configurations , the ext image recovered 20%30% fluxes of what covered by com and sub images .",
    "this filtering effect explains why the masses reported in table 2 are consistently lower than those in @xcite . the ext image at 345 ghz represents the high contrast structure in these cores  the small , compact condensations tracing the immediate surroundings of the protostars .",
    "our observations reveal fragmentation at different spatial scales in g28.34-p1 .",
    "first , the 1 pc clump fragments into five cores @xcite ; second , two of the 0.1 pc cores fragment into even small condensations of 0.01 pc .",
    "the fragmentation at clump and core scales are consistent with a hierarchical fragmentation picture .",
    "the clump fragmentation is likely the result of initial physical conditions ( density , temperature , turbulence , and magnetic fields ) , while the core fragmentation results from an increased density after the initial fragmentation .",
    "based on the very large array ( vla ) 3  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra @xcite and the iram 30 m 1.3 mm continuum image @xcite , we measure an initial gas temperature of 13k and density of @xmath55 @xmath56 , over a scale of 1 pc toward the p1 clump .",
    "these values yield a thermal jeans mass of 0.8 . at the core scale ,",
    "density increases to several 10 times of the initial clump density .",
    "for instance , in sma2 the core density measured from the 230ghz image is @xmath57 @xmath56 , 32 times of the initial clump density .",
    "this density , together with an increased gas temperature ( 16 k ) , leads to a thermal jeans mass of 0.2 .",
    "these parameters are also listed in table [ tab : frags ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in both clump and core fragmentation , the observed fragment ( core / condensation ) masses are significantly ( @xmath58 times or more ) larger than the expected thermal jeans masses ( table [ tab : frags ] ) , indicating that thermal pressure is not dominant in the fragmentation processes . instead",
    ", turbulence may play an important role in supporting these large core / condensation masses , as discussed in @xcite ( see further discussion in section [ subsect : cylinder ] ) . the 1@xmath59 rms sensitivity in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] is 0.8 mjy , corresponding to 0.2 , well below the thermal jeans mass at the clump scale ( 0.8 ) .",
    "however , we did not detect any cores of 0.8  in the filament .",
    "the non - detection of jeans mass cores in the clump may suggest that low mass cores are not significantly centrally peaked , thus they can not be substantiated from the smooth emission in the clump .",
    "the most intriguing feature in g28.34-p1 is the configuration of well aligned , regularly spaced cores .",
    "the alignment and regularity strongly suggest a mechanism that is responsible for shaping the molecular filament into what it is now .",
    "similar features ( but at different spatial scales ) have been reported in a large number of nearby dark clouds @xcite , in a few filamentary irdcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these fragments are most likely the results of gravitational collapse of a cylinder , as first proposed by @xcite and followed up by @xcite ( also see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the theory predicts that , under self gravity , the gas in the cylinder will ultimately beak up into pieces with a certain interval ( @xmath60 ) at which the instability grows the fastest and thus dominates the fragmentation process .",
    "such ` sausage ' instability produces a chain of equally spaced fragments along the filament , with the spacing roughly the interval @xmath60 .",
    "the mass per unit length along the cylinder ( or linear mass density ) has a maximum value , @xmath61 pc@xmath9 , where @xmath62 is the gravitational constant . if the cylinder is supported by thermal pressure , @xmath63 is the sound speed @xmath64 ; if , on the other hand , it is mainly supported by turbulent pressure , then @xmath63 is replaced by the velocity dispersion @xmath59 .",
    "we now compare the observational results with the theoretical predictions . in g28.34-p1 ,",
    "the fwhm line width is 1.7 -1 , measured form the 3 ( 1,1 ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "the line width is equivalent to a velocity dispersion of @xmath65 -1 if the line profile is gaussian .",
    "this velocity dispersion leads to a maximum mass density of 240 pc@xmath9 .",
    "the total core mass in p1 is 183  over 0.8 pc along the filament @xcite , implying a linear mass density of 230 pc@xmath9 .",
    "taking into account the missing flux in the interferometer maps , the observations match the theoretical predictions well if g28.34-p1 is mainly supported by turbulence .",
    "the separation between two adjacent fragments , @xmath60 , depends on the nature of the cylinder . for an incompressible fluid cylinder in absence of magnetic field , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the unperturbed cylindrical radius .",
    "and the instability manifests at about two free - fall timescales ( see section [ subsect : outflow_para ] ) . in g28.34-p1 ,",
    "the average separation between cores is @xmath68pc , implying an initial radius of @xmath69pc , several times smaller than the core diameter of 0.1 pc @xcite .",
    "if magnetic field is involved , the strength is of the order of @xmath70 ( see equation ( 93 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "with @xmath71 3  and @xmath72 pc , we obtain a magnetic field strength of 0.16 mg .",
    "this is relatively small compared to magnetic field strength observed in massive star formation regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for an isothermal gas cylinder , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the scale height , whereas @xmath75 is the gas density at the center of the cylinder .",
    "the equation can be simplified as @xmath76 in the above equations , the sound speed @xmath64 of 0.21 -1 is calculated using a gas temperature of 13 k ; volume density @xmath77 3 is the averaged clump density , while @xmath78 3 is the average of clump density ( @xmath77 3 ) and core density ( @xmath79 3 ) given in table [ tab : frags ] .",
    "we see that both scenarios are in agreement with the observed spacing of @xmath80pc if the assumptions are reasonable .",
    "however , since the density should be the central density of the cylinder , we suspect that the turbulent support is more likely dominant in g28.34-p1 .",
    "comparison between observational results and theoretical predictions suggests that the fragmentation in the g28.34-p1 filament is well represented by a cylindrical collapse .",
    "the filament is likely supported mainly by turbulence rather than thermal pressure .",
    "we measure the core density profiles in unresolved cores sma1 , sma3 , and sma5 .",
    "the measurements are performed in the visibility domain to avoid defects in image deconvolution .",
    "we combine the sub , com , and ext data for analysis for this purpose .",

    "[ fig : uvamp ] plots the amplitude versus  distance for sma1 , sma3 , and sma5 .",

    "the results are consistent with @xcite measured from the 230 ghz continuum data , where they derived @xmath96 for sma4 .",
    "the density profiles are similar to that of an isothermal sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium , where the radial density scales as @xmath97 .",
    "we note that the large error bars and discrepancy at long  distances reflect sensitivity limits and may be also partly due to unresolved weak sources in the vicinity .        among the entire 8ghz sma band ,",
    "only co(32 ) is detected above @xmath98 ( @xmath99k at 1 -1 resolution ) .",

    "this effect actually helped us identify outflows at high velocities .",
    "it is intriguing that all the five dust cores are associated with co outflows , majority of which are bipolar , jet - like outflows .",
    "the outflows are centered on the dust cores and are generally oriented cross the major axis of the filament . the most prominent outflow is centered on core sma2 , with a blue lobe emanating toward southeast ( se ; see channels of 5171 -1 in fig .",

    "[ fig : outflows ] , outflows sma2a and sma3 have four pairs of knots , and outflow sma4a has two pairs .",
    "the knots are equally spaced by about 0.16pc .",
    "these knots in outflows may represent outbursts due to disk variability arising from episodic , unsteady accretion ( e.g. , hh 211 , @xcite ; hh 80 - 81 , @xcite ) .",

    "sma2a and sma4a , and probably sma1 , the knots seem to trace the propagation of a periodically wiggled , -shaped molecular jet , most evident at the closest knotty pairs near the protostar .",
    "part of this effect may be contaminated by multiple outflows ( e.g. , in outflow sma2a ) .",

    "@xcite reported one outflow in iras 05358 + 3543 with a collimation factor of @xmath58 and claimed that it was the first massive outflow observed with such a high degree of collimation at a scale of 1pc . in g28.34-p1 , the sma2a and sma3 outflows are among the best collimated molecular outflows yet discovered in high - mass star - forming regions over parsec scales .",
    "we note that these collimation factors should be considered as lower limits because the outflow lengths and widths are not corrected for inclination angle , and are not deconvolved with synthesized beam .",
    "the presence of highly collimated outflows demonstrates a protostellar nature of the condensations in g28.34-p1 .",
    "@xcite reported a luminosity of @xmath124  for the 24  source associated with sma2 .",
    "@xcite obtained a luminosity of @xmath125  for the entire p1 clump .",
    "these luminosities set a limit on the mass of the embedded stars of 37 , if they are at the zero - age main sequence .",
    "the stellar masses put these objects at an intermediate - mass stage .",
    "the presence of highly collimated outflows also favors a disk - mediated accretion scenario of massive mass star formation @xcite in a manner similar to low - mass star formation .",
    "in addition , the high collimation also indicates that these outflows are at very early stages since the opening angle of outflows widens as they evolve .",
    "the g28.34-p1 condensations are comparable in mass to the nearby intermediate - mass `` cores '' ( 25 ) at a similar spatial extent ( @xmath126au ; @xcite ) .",
    "the non - detection of organic molecules ( ch@xmath127oh , ch@xmath127cn , etc . ) in p1 is likely due to the sensitivity limit of our observations .",
    "@xcite observed copious hot core molecular line emissions toward i22198 , an intermediate - mass star with a luminosity of 370 at a distance of 0.76kpc .",
    "the typical brightness temperature of the lines is 0.8k .",
    "if we scale i22198 to the distance of g28.34 , the emission would become 40 times fainter , well below our detection limit of 0.1 k per 1 -1  resolution ( also true for * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is possible that g28.34-p1 may have already experienced an increase in abundance of organic molecules as expected from protostellar heating , similar to i22198 .",
    "deep spectroscopy with alma will be able to verify the presence of hot core type molecules in g28.34-p1 .    despite the similarities between the g28.34-p1 condensations and the intermediate - mass star forming `` cores ''",
    ", there is an important distinction between the two : the g28.34-p1 condensations are embedded in compact ( @xmath5pc ) , dense cores ( @xmath1283 , see table [ tab : frags ] ) with several tens of solar masses , which are hierarchically embedded in a massive , dense ( @xmath1293 , table [ tab : frags ] ) molecular clump of over @xmath14 , an order of magnitude larger than the mass in a typical intermediate - mass star - forming region . with a typical star formation efficiency of 30% in dense gas and a standard stellar initial mass function ,",
    "it is natural to expected that massive stars will eventually emerge in some of the condensations ( if not all ) , at the end of protostellar accretion . at that time",
    ", p1 would become a massive star cluster . in the context of evolution ,",
    "an immediate comparison to g28.34-p1 is the northern clump g28.34-p2 in the same cloud complex , which may represent the future of p1 . with a similar clump mass",
    ", p2 has a higher gas temperature of 30 k , and a higher luminosity of @xmath130  @xcite , equivalent to a zero - age main - sequence mass of 14 .",
    "the sma observations detected molecular lines from ch@xmath127oh and ch@xmath127cn in the p2 cores , while none in the p1 cores @xcite .",
    "likewise , other massive molecular clumps ( e.g. , w33a , @xcite ; g31.41 , @xcite ; ngc 6334 , @xcite ; g10.6 , @xcite ) that have luminosities of @xmath131 , and are associated with radio continuum emission , may represent an even more evolved phase of massive star formation at which high mass protostellar objects have already emerged .",
    "the large mass reservoir ( 2264  at @xmath132pc ; 1000  at @xmath21pc ) in g28.34-p1 and the outflows suggest that the condensations are , and will remain , actively accreting materials through the ambient medium .",
    "materials in the cores fall onto the embedded protostars through disks and at the same time materials in the clump fall onto the cores .",
    "observations of g28.34-p1 seem to indicate a continuous accretion over a spatial scale that spreads two orders of magnitude , from 1 to 0.01pc , and finally reaches onto the protostars .",
    "this is a relatively new picture , but has also been reported in another irdc , g30.88 + 0.13 @xcite .",
    "a comparison with massive and more luminous molecular clumps indicates that the condensations will grow in mass , and likely emerge as massive stars eventually .",
    "the embedded protostars appear to be still intermediate - mass objects and are on their way to eventual massive stars .",
    "our observations of the g28.34-p1 clump provide perhaps the first glimpse of an intermediate - mass stage of massive , clustered star formation .",
    "we present an observational study of the p1 clump in irdc g28.34 + 0.06 using the sma at the 345ghz band .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "high resolution and high sensitivity image at 0.88 mm reveals hierarchical fragmentation at 1pc and 0.1pc scales .",
    "the mass of the dust cores and condensations are much larger than the relevant thermal jean masses .",
    "the clump fragmentation is consistent with a cylindrical collapse .",
    "all five dust cores are driving highly collimated co(32 ) outflows , indicating a protostellar nature of the condensations embedded in the cores .",
    "bipolar , jet - like outflows suggest a disk - mediated accretion of high - mass star formation .    \\3 .",
    "the relatively low luminosity and a lack of detection of organic molecules indicate that the condensations in p1 underline an intermediate - mass stage of massive star formation and will likely form massive stars eventually .",
