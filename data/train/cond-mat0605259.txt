    "recent experiments have appointed coupling to acoustic phonons as the main source of electron relaxation in the excited states of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) with weak lateral confinement@xcite and coupled quantum dots ( cqds ) with small tunneling energy,@xcite i.e. , with the electronic relevant energy scale in the few - mev range .",
    "this usually restricts lifetimes to the order of nanoseconds,@xcite imposing severe limitations on the performance of qd devices which rely on the coherent dynamics of electron charge states . a prominent example are charge qubits , whose main disadvantage , as compared to spin qubits , is the faster decoherence rate.@xcite    as a first step to eventually gain control over charge relaxation rates , several theoretical works have investigated the fundamental physics of electron - phonon coupling in qd structures .",
    "bockelmann described the qualitative effect of lateral ( spatial and magnetic ) confinement on the electron transition rates in qds.@xcite the domains of deformation potential ( dp ) and piezoelectric field ( pz ) interactions , the two main scattering mechanisms leading to interaction with acoustic phonons , were established for both qd and cqd structures.@xcite building on these works , methods to minimize electron - phonon coupling in qds and vertically cqds were recently proposed which may bring electron lifetimes in the range of microseconds , thus making them comparable to usual spin relaxation rates.@xcite noteworthy , all of the aforementioned experimental and theoretical works studied charge relaxation at a single - electron ( se ) level .",
    "so far , multi - electron ( me ) systems have been essentially restricted to the context of spin relaxation,@xcite and only lately charge relaxation processes in me systems started to be considered.@xcite in particular , in ref .",
    "we have investigated coulomb correlated systems , and we have reported numerical evidence that electronic correlations generally lead to reduced decay rates of the excited electronic states in weakly confined dots , as compared to independent - particle estimates .",
    "this finding suggests that me devices might better exploit the discrete energy spectrum of qds .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous investigation ( ref .  )",
    "analyzing in detail the mechanisms by which coulomb interaction affects charge relaxation rates in me qd systems .",
    "we also investigate the effect of external magnetic fields on intradot transition rates , and isospin transition rates in me vertically cqds .",
    "electron - phonon interaction is included through both dp and pz scattering channels ( the latter was neglected in ref . as well as in many theoretical investigations ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theo ] we describe our theoretical model . in section [ sec : sqd ] we study me charge relaxation in single qds as a function of the lateral ( spatial and magnetic ) confinement , and interpret the correlation - induced scattering reduction in terms of the se configuration mixing .",
    "the applicability in me qds of magnetic - field - based suggestions for controlling charge relaxation rates , previously reported for se structures@xcite , is addressed in this section . in section [ sec : cqd ] we investigate the effect of interdot distance on the isospin transition rate of me vertically cqds , and finally in section [ sec : summ ] we summarize our results .",
    "the theoretical model we use is similar to that described in ref .   for single - electron excitations , but now considering @xmath0-electron states ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we study disk - shaped qds where the lateral confinement is much weaker than the vertical one , and the dot and surrounding barrier are made of materials with similar elastic properties .",
    "several qd structures reported in the literature fit this description.@xcite    a number of useful approximations can be made for such qds .",
    "first , since the weak lateral confinement gives inter - level spacings within the range of few mev , only acoustic phonons have significant interaction with free carriers , while optical phonons can be safely neglected .",
    "second , the elastically homogeneous materials are not expected to induce phonon confinement , which allow us to consider only bulk phonons .",
    "finally , the different energy scales of vertical and lateral electronic confinement allow us to decouple vertical and lateral motion in the building of se spin - orbitals .",
    "we then take a parabolic confinement profile in the in - plane @xmath2 direction , with single - particle energy gaps @xmath3 , which yields the fock - darwin states.@xcite in the vertical direction ( @xmath4 ) the confinement is provided by a rectangular quantum well of length @xmath5 , with the barrier height determined by the band - offset between the qd and barrier materials .",
    "the quantum well solutions are derived numerically .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is neglected in this work , since the long spin relaxation times measured in qd structures similar to those we study here indicate that the spin degrees of freedom are well separated from the orbital ones.@xcite therefore , the se spin - orbitals can be written as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the @xmath8th fock - darwin orbital with azimuthal angular momentum @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the symmetric quantum well solution with parity @xmath11 with respect to the reflection about the @xmath12 plane , with @xmath13 denoting even ( odd ) parity , and @xmath14 is the spinor eigenvector of the spin @xmath15component with eigenvalue @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we will also label fock - darwin states with the standard notation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 correspond to @xmath20 , respectively .    as for the inclusion of coulomb interactions ,",
    "we need to go beyond the hartree - fock approximation in order to include electronic correlations , which are critical in phonon - induced electron scattering processes.@xcite moreover , since we are interested in the relaxation time of excited states , we need to know both ground and excited states with comparable accuracy .",
    "our method of choice is the full configuration interaction approach : the me wave functions are written as linear combinations @xmath21 , where the slater determinants @xmath22 are obtained by filling in the se spin - orbitals @xmath23 with the @xmath0 electrons in _ all _ possible ways consistent with symmetry requirements ; here @xmath24 creates an electron in the level @xmath23 .",
    "the me ground and excited states can then be labeled by the total angular momentum @xmath4 component @xmath25 , total parity @xmath26 , total spin @xmath27 , and total spin @xmath4-projection @xmath28 . the fully interacting hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized , exploiting orbital and spin symmetries.@xcite    we assume zero temperature , which suffices to capture the main features of one - phonon processes.@xcite at this temperature , only phonon emission processes are present .",
    "we evaluate the relaxation rate between selected initial ( occupied ) and final ( unoccupied ) me states , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , using the fermi golden rule :    @xmath31    where the electron states @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) have been written explicitly as linear combinations of slater determinants , @xmath34 is the interaction operator of an electron with an acoustic phonon of momentum @xmath35 via deformation potential @xmath36 or piezoelectric field @xmath37 interaction , @xmath38 stands for the @xmath23 electron state energy and @xmath39 represents the phonon energy .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction matrix element can be written more explicitely as    @xmath40    where the right - most term is the electron form factor and @xmath41 is a prefactor which depends on the scattering mechanism @xmath42.@xcite it is worth noting that , whereas for dp scattering @xmath43 , for pz scattering @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "dp scattering is dominant when the emitted phonon energy is sufficiently large , while pz scattering dominates at small phonon energy . for se transitions in gaas qds , even in the weakly - confined regime",
    ", the dp mechanism usually prevails in the absence of external fields .",
    "however , we have recently shown @xcite that the pz mechanism may rapidly become dominant in the presence of a vertical magnetic field which tends to suppress the single - particle gaps .",
    "one can see from the above expressions that coulomb interaction influences electron scattering with phonons in two ways .",
    "first , it introduces changes in the electron energy gaps @xmath45 , and hence in the energy and momentum of the emitted phonon.@xcite second , it introduces changes in the orbital part of the electron state , hence changing the electron - phonon wave functions coupling . the latter effect is reflected in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) through the slater determinant coefficients . indeed , since the total scattering rate is but a weighted sum of se contributions , the general behavior of se scattering events will also apply to the me case . however , the weight of each se contribution strongly depends on the number of particles , the regime of correlations , and the presence of external fields , so that important changes in the me relaxation rates should be expected when varying these parameters .    in this work",
    "we consider mostly relaxation rates corresponding to the fundamental spin - conserving transition in single and coupled qds , i.e. transitions involving the ground state and the first excited state with the same @xmath46 quantum numbers .",
    "this transition could be monitored , e.g. , by means of pump - and - probe techniques,@xcite since relaxation to or from any intermediate state with different spin should be much slower and therefore it will barely interfere .",
    "below we shall investigate gaas / al@xmath47ga@xmath48as qds , using the following material parameters:@xcite electron effective mass @xmath49 , band - offset @xmath50 mev , crystal density @xmath51 kg / m@xmath52 , acoustic deformation potential constant @xmath53 ev , effective dielectric constant @xmath54 , and piezoelectric constant @xmath55 v / m . for the sound speed @xmath56",
    ", we take into account that in cylindrical qds most of the scattering arises from phonon propagation close to the growth direction.@xcite",
    "we then assume that the qds are grown along the @xmath57 $ ] direction and use the corresponding values @xmath58 m / s and @xmath59 m / s.@xcite in our calculations we deal with qds with lateral confinement energies which in some cases are rather weak ( @xmath60 mev ) .",
    "well - converged few - body states are obtained for such structures using a basis set composed by the slater determinants which result from all possible combinations of 62 se spin - orbitals with @xmath0 electrons . due to the strong confinement in the vertical direction , only the lowest @xmath61 ( for single qds ) or the lowest @xmath62 ( for cqds ) eigenstates",
    "are included in the single - particle basis .",
    "in this section we first study charge relaxation rates in qds with @xmath0 interacting electrons as a function of the harmonic lateral confinement originated by electrostatic fields , and next consider the effect of adding a magnetic field . to study the lateral confinement , we vary the characteristic frequency of the confining parabola in the @xmath63 mev range , thus moving from a strongly- to a rather weakly - correlated regime .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the corresponding results for @xmath64 electrons in qds with height @xmath65 nm .",
    "it can be observed that for all @xmath0 the qualitative shape of the relaxation rate curve is similar to that of the se case ( top panel ) : it shows two maxima , connected with the pz and dp scattering mechanisms , and it vanishes at small and large confinement energies due to the small phonon density and small electron - phonon coupling , respectively.@xcite another trend observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the shift of the scattering rate maxima towards larger confinement energies with increasing number of electrons , as well as the increasing relative height of the pz maximum .",
    "both features follow from the increasing density of states with larger @xmath0 , which leads to smaller inter - level spacing and , therefore , to larger @xmath66 values associated with a given phonon energy .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with downward arrows to point at the confinement energies which give two selected phonon energies , @xmath67 ( solid arrowhead ) and @xmath68 mev ( empty arrowhead ) .",
    "it can be seen that there is a shift towards larger @xmath66 values with increasing @xmath0.@xcite an important implication of this result is that pz scattering , which is negligible except at very weak confinement energies in the se picture , may actually become the dominant scattering mechanism for usual qd confinement energies in the me case ( see , e.g. , @xmath69 mev in the @xmath70 picture ) . in light of this , some of the estimates in previous investigations , which studied electron - phonon coupling in weakly - confined qds considering dp interaction only , may need a revision.@xcite    one also observes in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the phonon energy which gives maximum scattering is approximately constant , regardless of the number of electrons and lateral confinement .",
    "for example , @xmath71 mev for the dp maximum .",
    "this indicates that the scattering is mainly determined by the electron - phonon coupling along the vertical direction : indeed , at @xmath72 mev the longitudinal acoustic phonon wavelength gives maximum coupling with the electron wave function _ in the quantum well _ , which does not depend on @xmath73 and is weakly affected by coulomb interactions .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the excited state lifetimes depend strongly on the number of carriers ( note the different vertical scale of each panel ) , the shorter lifetimes being shown by the @xmath74 case . as a matter of fact , the @xmath74 transition , which corresponds to the @xmath75 relaxation , represents the independent - particle limit of the me cases shown in the same figure . for example , for @xmath76 an independent particle filling gives a @xmath77 ground state , with the two electrons occupying the @xmath78 spin - orbitals , and a @xmath79 excited state , with one electron in the @xmath78 orbital and another in the @xmath80 orbital ( see electronic configuration diagrams in fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "thus , the transition involves a one - electron scattering @xmath81 orbital , while the other electron remains as a spectator .",
    "similar reasonings apply to @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the coulomb - interaction - free relaxation rate ( @xmath74 panel ) generally gives an upper - bound to the actual rate when electron - electron interaction is taken into account .",
    "this result holds for all number of particles studied and most confinement strengths , although the trend is non - monotonic with @xmath0 .",
    "the reduction of the relaxation rate noted above can be explained in terms of se configurations mixing . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "we analyze in detail the @xmath76 and @xmath83 cases in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where panel ( a ) represents the electronic configurations of the first excited and ground states which follow from an independent - particle filling , while panel ( b ) represents the two most important configurations contributing to the same states when coulomb interaction is included . by comparison",
    ", one can see that in the non - interacting picture only the @xmath84 transition takes place , whereas in the interacting picture it is partially replaced by the @xmath85 and @xmath86 transitions .",
    "we then compare the relaxation rates of the individual se scattering processes [ panel ( c ) ] , fixing the transition energy @xmath87 in all cases in order to ensure that the comparison considers orbital effects only .",
    "one can see that @xmath75 is the fastest transition .",
    "therefore , when it is partially replaced by @xmath85 and @xmath86 the overall relaxation rate is reduced . obviously , the stronger the mixing of configurations the larger the reduction .",
    "this explains why the @xmath83 scattering rate is well below that of @xmath76 : the ground state electrons already occupy the @xmath80-shell and the kinetic energy difference with respect to the excited states is then much smaller , which allows stronger coulomb - induced mixing . analogous logic can be used to explain the scattering reduction in the @xmath88 systems .",
    "+ we next investigate the effect of a magnetic field @xmath89 , applied along the vertical direction of the qd , on the me relaxation rate .",
    "the magnetic field is expected to introduce new physics because it strongly modifies the se energy levels , which now draw the well - known fock - darwin spectrum.@xcite in particular , the states involved in the fundamental transition converge to the same ( lowest ) landau level .",
    "this has important implications on the energy of the emitted phonon -which is reduced- , the regime of electronic correlations -which become stronger- and the se configurations of the low - lying me states -which differ from those at zero magnetic field- . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot the relaxation rate corresponding to @xmath76 in a qd with lateral confinement @xmath69 mev and width @xmath65 nm .",
    "we show the fundamental transition both in the singlet ( @xmath90 ) sector ( solid lines ) and in the triplet ( @xmath91 ) sector .",
    "we also compare the interacting and non - interacting case ( thick and thin lines , respectively ) .",
    "it can be seen in the figure that the shape of the me curves is again qualitatively similar to that of the se ones . from previous investigations , we know that the scattering rate at fields exceeding a few tesla is largely determined by the pz scattering channel.@xcite in addition , we note that the correlation - induced reduction of the relaxation rates changes with the field .",
    "indeed , the factor of reduction tends to decrease as @xmath89 increases , and at some point ( @xmath92 t for the singlet sector , @xmath93 t for the triplet sector ) the effect of correlations is reversed , so that a small enhancement is found instead of the more common reduction .",
    "this reversal in the behavior can be explained in terms of the mixing of configurations in the presence of a magnetic field . when no coulomb interaction is considered only the @xmath94 se transition contributes to the total scattering , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "however , if we take into account the coulomb - induced mixing between the two most important configurations , fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , new relaxation channels are opened , notably the @xmath95 and @xmath96 se transitions . the increasing relative weight of these transitions with @xmath89 , along with the fact that the @xmath96 transition becomes faster than the @xmath94 one at sufficiently strong fields [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ] , justify the observation that electronic correlations at high magnetic field yield slightly increased relaxation rates.@xcite yet , it may be worth pointing out that this takes place when the states involved in the transition have almost converged in energy ( see inset in figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , at such magnetic field values the investigated transitions are not the fundamental transition anymore , since higher - angular - momenta states have already come down in energy ( this occurs at about @xmath97 t in the qd we study , when the @xmath98 level becomes the ground state ) .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that electron - phonon coupling can be tailored in weakly - confined qds and cqds , so that se lifetimes may be increased by orders of magnitude.@xcite the physical idea behind this possibility is to achieve an anti - phase relation between the phonon wave and the electron wave function _ along the growth direction _ of the qd structure , i.e. , to make the phonon wavelength along @xmath4 a divisor of the quantum well width , thereby reducing strongly the value of the form factor in equation [ eq2 ] .",
    "the phonon wavelength can be controlled through the _ lateral _ confinement , which is in turn determined either by electrostatic fields or by an axial magnetic field .",
    "the latter reduces the energy splitting between the low - lying se states and thus increases the phonon wavelength in a controllable manner.@xcite the possibility of using external fields to suppress charge relaxation also in me systems may pose a significant support for the eventual fabrication of me qd devices with small decoherece rates . however , the applicability is not straightforward : indeed , as mentioned before , the energy of the emitted phonon corresponding to the fundamental transition decreases with increasing @xmath0 , owing to the larger density of states.@xcite as a result , the phonon wavelength may be too long to ever match anti - phase relation with the electron wave function in the growth direction . in order to explore this issue , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we represent the charge relaxation rate in a qd with @xmath99 mev and @xmath100 nm with @xmath76 and @xmath83 electrons . for @xmath76 , two scattering minima show up at @xmath101 t and @xmath102 t. these are the same values as found in the @xmath74 case,@xcite which suggests that the @xmath76 scattering is well described as an independent - particle event .",
    "however , the @xmath83 picture only shows one minimum at @xmath103 t ( the dip at @xmath104 t is simply due to the crossing between the @xmath105 and @xmath106 energy levels ) .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of phonon energy reduction due to coulomb interactions . for a larger number of electrons ( not shown ) ,",
    "when the density of states is still higher , the magnetic field brings about frequent changes of energy levels with different symmetry , so that tuning the emitted phonon energy is no longer feasible .",
    "we then conclude that @xmath89-induced suppression of charge relaxation rates holds for qds with a small enough number of electrons , but it rapidly loses efficiency as the number of particles increases , owing to the increasing density of states .",
    "in this section we study charge relaxation rates corresponding to @xmath0-electron isospin transitions in vertically cqds as a function of the interdot barrier thickness @xmath107 .",
    "the two qds are supposed to be identical.@xcite we focus on the transition between the lowest symmetric ( @xmath108 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath109 ) solutions of the double quantum well with the spin quantum numbers of the ground state , i.e. , the fundamental isospin ( interdot ) transition .",
    "this is indeed the fundamental transition of the system when the tunneling energy is smaller than the lateral confinement energy of the constituent qds .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] illustrates the results for a cqd structure with @xmath110 nm , @xmath99 mev and @xmath111 electrons .",
    "solid lines indicate the total scattering rate , while dashed and dotted lines represent the contribution coming separately from dp and pz interactions , respectively . as for the intradot transition case",
    ", it is worth noting that the @xmath74 calculation represents the independent - particle limit of the @xmath76 and @xmath83 systems .",
    "since the maximum scattering rate of the @xmath76 ( @xmath83 ) system is smaller than that of @xmath74 by a factor of about 4 ( 2 ) , we conclude that interdot transitions also benefit from a correlation - induced reduction of the scattering rates .",
    "such reduction can be interpreted in terms of configuration mixing in analogous manner to the intradot case described in the previous section .",
    "we note in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the shape of the scattering rate curve is qualitatively similar for @xmath74 and @xmath83 , with a dominating and oscillating dp scattering intensity at small barrier thickness , and a pz contribution which becomes dominant as the barrier thickness exceeds @xmath112 nm.@xcite in contrast , the shape significantly differs for @xmath76 , where the pz contribution is missing .",
    "actually , a close inspection reveals that it has been suppressed by almost four orders of magnitude .",
    "this striking result can not be interpreted as a consequence of correlations on the electron wave function , as in previous sections , because the orbital part of the electron - phonon interaction matrix element is identical for dp and pz scattering mechanisms ( see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) , and therefore the effect should be apparent also for dp scattering . therefore , the origin must be connected with the effect of coulomb interaction on the emitted phonon energy .    to better understand this result , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we compare the @xmath107 dependence of the tunneling energy , and hence that of the emitted phonon , for @xmath76 with and without coulomb interaction .",
    "clearly , coulomb interaction is responsible for a significantly faster reduction of the tunneling energy .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath107 which would lead to maximum pz scattering for non - interacting electrons ( e.g. , @xmath113 nm ) , are now associated with very small phonon energies . as a result",
    ", the phonon density of states is very small and the electron - phonon coupling is strongly reduced .",
    "this behavior is no longer found in the @xmath83 system .",
    "an interpretation of this observation is provided in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where we show the dominant se configurations for the interacting and non - interacting electrons . in the absence of coulomb interaction ,",
    "the only configuration for the @xmath108 state has two electrons in the lowest se symmetric orbital ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath109 state the only significant configuration is that with one electron in the lowest se symmetric orbital and another in the lowest antisymmetric orbital ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , when coulomb interaction is included for @xmath108 we mostly obtain a linear combination of @xmath114 and @xmath116 configurations .",
    "the thicker the barrier , the smaller the tunneling energy and the larger the mixing between these two configurations . in the limit where both configurations have equal weight",
    ", the @xmath108 state will be degenerate with the @xmath109 one .",
    "in other words , coulomb interaction tends to make @xmath108 and @xmath109 solutions converge in energy with increasing @xmath107 .",
    "this is not possible for @xmath83 because the unpaired electron prevents a similar mixing of configurations which use @xmath16 and @xmath117 orbitals while preserving the total parity quantum number .",
    "therefore , the only significant electronic configuration for @xmath108 and @xmath109 are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the transition between these two configurations can be envisaged as the relaxation of a single hole from @xmath117 to @xmath16 orbitals , which explains the similar behavior of @xmath83 as compared to @xmath74 .",
    "we have investigated the effect of coulomb interaction on the charge relaxation rates of disk - shaped qd systems with few electrons , due to incoherent coupling with acoustic phonons .",
    "we have studied both intradot transitions in single qds and interdot ( isospin ) transitions in vertically cqds .",
    "coulomb interaction affects the scattering rates in two ways : first , it changes the emitted phonon energy and momentum , and second , it changes the electron wave function through electronic correlations .",
    "both effects have a significant influence on the electron relaxation rate in a way that generally leads to a reduction of the intradot and interdot transition rates .",
    "this trend is gradually quenched by axial magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , the increasing density of states with higher number of particles reduces the energy of the emitted phonons , which renders pz interaction increasingly important , so that it may eventually become the dominant scattering mechanism even at zero magnetic field .",
    "we have finally shown that the suppression of electron scattering in weakly - confined qds , which was recently suggested for se systems,@xcite also applies to multi - electron qds with a sufficiently small number of particles .",

    "<S> we show that electronic correlations generally reduce intradot and interdot transition rates with respect to corresponding single - electron transitions , but this effect is lessened by external magnetic fields . on the other hand , piezoelectric field scattering is found to become the dominant relaxation mechanism as the number of confined electrons increases . </S>",
    "<S> previous proposals to strongly suppress electron - phonon coupling in properly designed single - electron quantum dots are shown to hold also in multi - electron devices . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that few - electron orbital degrees of freedom are more stable than single - electron ones . </S>"
