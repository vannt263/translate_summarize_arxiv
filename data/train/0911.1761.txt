    "we wish to shed some light on the structure of quantum mechanics by considering a question which is often on the minds of those just learning the theory : why a _ complex _",
    "hilbert space ?",
    "we may justify this choice in a variety of ways ( see for example , scott aaronson s discussion in @xcite ) , citing algebraic closure , etc .",
    "but often one finds no statement about how the world would be _ different _ if something else was chosen .    what would happen if we replace the complex numbers with something else , leaving the remaining structure intact ?",
    "what could we reasonably replace them with ?",
    "adler @xcite argues from a list of properties of probability amplitudes that the only possibilities are the reals , complex numbers , quaternions and octonions .",
    "we will omit the octonions since they are non - associative .",
    "thus we will consider two alternatives to the complex numbers : the reals and quaternions .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite @xcite that every experiment described in the usual quantum formalism admits another description within real quantum mechanics that predicts the same outcome statistics .",
    "moreover , the description within real quantum mechanics respects the same division into subsystems as the original description .",
    "thus the non - local effects of complex quantum mechanics are duplicated in real quantum mechanics .    in some sense",
    ", then , there is no difference between real and complex quantum mechanics ; they both describe the same set of experiments and generate the same predictions for each of these experiments .",
    "however , there are good reasons for preferring complex quantum mechanics . for example",
    ", the translation from the complex description to the real description given in @xcite allows a larger set of operations in the real description than in the complex description , including operations corresponding to complex conjugation , and global phase measurements .",
    "since these operations do not appear to be physically realizable the complex formalism more closely resembles the experimental reality . put another way , we may need some superselection rules in order to describe particular physical systems using the real formalism .    in the remainder of this paper we consider quantum mechanics over the quaternions . a simulation , similar to the real simulation of complex quantum mechanics , developed by fernandez et al .",
    "@xcite shows that , for local systems at least , complex quantum mechanics can simulate quaternionic quantum mechanics .",
    "but what about arbitrary systems with many subsystems ?",
    "we develop a construction for a non - local box ( defined below ) within quaternionic quantum mechanics . thus if we consider two or more subsystems , quaternionic quantum mechanics is distinguishable from complex quantum mechanics and exhibits much stronger non - local effects .",
    "the quaternions ( @xmath0 ) , first described by william hamilton @xcite , are a division ring formed by adjoining new elements , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 to the real numbers @xmath4 .",
    "thus a quaternion looks like @xmath5 the new elements have the properties @xmath6 the multiplication of the elements @xmath7 is summarized in figure  [ fig : quatmult ] . when multiplying two elements along an arrow ( eg .",
    "@xmath8 ) the result is the third element in the cycle . when multiplying backwards along an arrow ( eg .",
    "@xmath9 ) a @xmath10 factor is added .",
    "so @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the elements @xmath13 and @xmath10 , of course , commute with the other elements .",
    "@xmath14 & \\\\    & & \\\\",
    "k \\ar@(ul , l)[uur ] & & \\ar@(dl , dr)[ll]j \\\\}\\ ] ]    just as complex numbers have a real and imaginary part , quaternions have a scalar and vector part .",
    "the scalar part is the part which lies on the real axis .",
    "we denote it by @xmath15 .",
    "the vector part , also called the pure imaginary part , is everything else , and in general is a vector in @xmath16 .",
    "we denote it by @xmath17 .",
    "the scalar and vector parts of @xmath18 , defined above , are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    like in the complex numbers",
    ", we may define the _ conjugate _ of a quaternion , which multiplies each of the non - real parts by -1 .",
    "thus the conjugate of @xmath18 is @xmath21 the norm on the quaternions is the same as in the complex numbers , i.e. @xmath22    the most important difference between the complex numbers and the quaternions is that the quaternions do not form a commutative algebra .",
    "this property will be the basis for the rest of our discussion .",
    "quaternionic quantum mechanics is formed , roughly speaking , by replacing every complex number in the usual quantum mechanics by a quaternion .",
    "thus states are vectors over the quaternions , so amplitudes are now quaternions instead of complex numbers .",
    "the usual norm - squared rule applies for deriving outcome probabilities , and discrete time evolution is described by unitary matrices @xmath23 over the quaternions with the usual property @xmath24 .",
    "now the hermitian conjugation @xmath25 is the matrix transpose , followed by quaternionic conjugation .",
    "although many more aspects of quantum mechanics , such as continuous time evolution , may be considered , these few properties will suffice for our discussion . for a comprehensive treatment of quanternionic quantum mechanics , see stephen adler s book @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative nature of the quaternions introduces many new properties into quaternionic quantum mechanics .",
    "the one we are most interested in here is the nature of multi - partite systems .",
    "consider a bipartite system in the state @xmath26 .",
    "define the unitary matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 @xmath30 we consider different ways that we may apply these matrices .",
    "first we apply @xmath27 to the first subsystem , obtaining @xmath31 .",
    "next we apply @xmath28 to the second subsytem , obtaining @xmath32 now consider the same operations , but applied in the reverse order .",
    "we apply @xmath28 to the second subsystem , obtaining @xmath33 , followed by @xmath27 applied to the first subsystem , obtaining @xmath34 here we see the non - commutativity of @xmath0 in action .",
    "the two states in equations  [ eq : stateij ] and  [ eq : stateji ] are orthogonal , but all we have changed is the time - ordering of two local operations on separate subsystems .    the above problem may be stated as follows : @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not commute .",
    "this extends to the tensor product problem : how do we define @xmath37 ? evidently the evolution of subsystems can not be considered without considering the context of the system as a whole .",
    "adler @xcite considers the same problem in the context of continuous evolution :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we conclude , then , that in quaternionic quantum mechanics , a sum of @xmath38 one - body hamiltonians gives a many - body hamiltonian that does not describe n independent particles ; the particle motions are coupled through the noncommutativity of the quaternion algebra .",
    "( adler @xcite , p. 245 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    what does this mean for locality ? is there such thing as a local transformation ?",
    "is it possible for alice and bob to actually perform the operations @xmath35 and @xmath36 ?",
    "the formalism does not answer this question .",
    "however , we may address this problem in another way .",
    "if alice and bob can locally perform these operations , then they can implement a non - local box .",
    "the non - local box , first defined by popescu and rohrlich in @xcite , is an imaginary device which produces non - local correlations between data in the following way : two distant parties , alice and bob , each have half of the box .",
    "they have one bit of input each , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and input their bit into their half of the box .",
    "each half of the box produces one bit of output , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , obeying the property @xmath43 the content of the famous chsh inequality @xcite is that this condition can not be satisfied by a non - signalling classical local hidden variable theory with probability better than @xmath44 when @xmath39 and @xmath40 are chosen uniformly at random .",
    "quantumly , we can do better , but are bounded above by @xmath45 , the cirelson bound @xcite .",
    "now we consider the case of quaternionic quantum mechanics .",
    "evidently it has stronger non - local behaviour than complex quantum mechanics , but how strong ? clearly we can at least achieve the cirelson bound since any strategy in complex quantum mechanics also exists in quaternionic quantum mechanics , but can we do better ?",
    "the answer is that we simulate the non - local box perfectly .",
    "consider the two parties , alice and bob , as before . before receiving their inputs",
    "they synchronize clocks and choose times @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is after they receive their inputs and @xmath48 is before they require the outputs ( we may arrange it so that the time elapsed is too short to allow signalling by moving alice and bob far enough away from each other . )",
    "they also share the state @xmath49 .",
    "alice does the following :    1",
    ".   receive input @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath50 then apply operation @xmath27 at time @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath51 then apply operation @xmath27 at time @xmath52 .",
    "4 .   at time",
    "@xmath48 measure in the basis @xmath53 and output the result as @xmath41",
    ".    meanwhile , bob does the following :    1",
    ".   receive input @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath54 then apply operation @xmath28 at time @xmath55 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath56 then apply operation @xmath28 at time @xmath57 .",
    "4 .   at time",
    "@xmath48 measure in the basis @xmath53 and output the result as @xmath42 .",
    "roughly what is happening here is that alice applies her operation before bob in all cases except when both of their inputs are 1 .",
    "alice and bob then detect this event using local measurements that are correlated except when bob goes first , in which case they are anti - correlated .",
    "consider the outputs that alice and bob generate .",
    "first note that the final state before measuring will be @xmath58 .",
    "if alice and bob both measure in the basis @xmath53 their outcomes will be the same if the relative phase was @xmath59 and opposite if the relative phase was @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that bob s input is @xmath61 .",
    "he will wait until @xmath55 before applying @xmath28 .",
    "regardless of her input , alice will apply @xmath27 before bob applies @xmath28 .",
    "thus the combined effect on @xmath62 is a relative phase change of @xmath63 , taking the state to @xmath64 .",
    "then alice and bob s measurements will agree and @xmath65 .",
    "meanwhile , if bob s input is @xmath13 the situation changes .",
    "if alice receive the input 0 then she applies @xmath27 at time @xmath47 and bob applies @xmath28 at time @xmath57 and the situation is the same as above .",
    "however , if alice receives the input 1 then she applies @xmath27 at time @xmath52 , _ after _ bob applies @xmath28 at time @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the effect on @xmath62 is a relative phase change of @xmath3 , taking the state to @xmath66 . in this case",
    "alice and bob s measurements will disagree and @xmath67 .",
    "we now briefly consider _ communication complexity_. suppose two parties , alice and bob , receive two inputs , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "they wish to compute the value of some funciton @xmath68 .",
    "how much communication is necessary between alice and bob ?",
    "( for simplicity , we suppose that alice receives the final answer . ) here we are interested in boolean functions , whose output is a single classical bit .",
    "it has been shown by van dam @xcite that the communication complexity of all boolean functions is trivial if non - local boxes are available .",
    "this means that bob needs to send only one bit of information to alice , and alice does not have to send anything to bob .",
    "however , there exist boolean functions , such as the inner product between two strings , for which the communication complexity in either a classical or quantum setting is maximal ( i.e. the optimal strategy is for bob to transmit his entire input to alice ) @xcite . coupled with the current result we find that within quaternionic quantum mechanics the communication complexity of all boolean functions is trivial .",
    "later brassard et al .",
    "@xcite turn van dam s result around , saying that if there is a non - trivial bound on the communication complexity of boolean functions , then non - local boxes do not exist .",
    "they also made this result robust by introducing a notion of probabilistic communication complexity and showing that if a non - local box can be approximated with probability better than @xmath69 then every boolean function has trivial probabilistic communication complexity .",
    "linden et al @xcite finally showed that for a particular boolean function ( and of two 2-bit strings ) if a non - local box can be approximated with probability better than @xmath70 ( the quantum upper bound ) then no communication is required and the function can be approximated better than the classical ( and quantum ) bound of @xmath44 . turning this result around ,",
    "if the communication complexity of and of 2-bit strings is non - trivial , then the non - local box can not be approximated any better than what is achievable by quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , if there is a non - trivial bound on communication complexity then quaternionic quantum mechanics is not a viable theory .    following this work , pawlowski et al .",
    "@xcite developed the notion of _ information causality _ which can be seen as a generalization of the notion of no - signalling .",
    "both classical and quantum theories obey information causality .",
    "pawlowski et al . were able to show that any physical theory which obeys information causality also obeys the cirelson bound @xcite .",
    "thus this is another way of excluding quaternionic quantum mechanics as a viable physical theory .",
