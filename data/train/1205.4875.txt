    "<S> more detailed account on the methods used will be given in section 3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this paper we initiate the study of a new approach for tackling the conjecture . </S>",

    "<S> in other words , if there is no lattice tiling of @xmath10 by lee spheres of radius @xmath11 then there is no tiling of @xmath10 by such lee spheres . </S>",
