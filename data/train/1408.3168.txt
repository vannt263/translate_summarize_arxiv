    "since the discovery of chaotic dynamics there has been a strong interest in finding coherent structures in systems generating very complex patterns . from the classic single@xcite and 2-scroll attractors @xcite , many reports have shown systems capable of displaying hyper - chaotic n - scroll dynamics@xcite . a number of those depend on the existence of nonlinear , non - invertible functions in their mathematical models .",
    "we highlight the work of tang _ _ et al.__@xcite that replaces the typical nonlinear piecewise - defined function by a sine function in the chua s circuit to generate multi - scroll attractors , and zhong _ et al .",

    "differential equations with time delay comprise another mechanism to generate hyper - chaos@xcite . in 1977",
    "mackey and glass@xcite proposed a first - order delayed nonlinear differential equation , which describes a physiological control system , that generates multi - scroll dynamics . since then a significant amount of hyperchaotic systems have been defined using these equations , e.g. wang _ _ et al.__@xcite , sprott@xcite and yalin _ et al _ @xcite .    in this letter , we present a general n - scroll chaotic system generated by a nonlinear delayed electro - optical feedback circuit . to build this circuit we were inspired by a modified version of the ikeda system @xcite , and , more recently , by an electro - optic circuit able to generate a variety of dynamics , from regular to high - dimensional chaos@xcite .    in a previous work @xcite we showed that this system has the capability to control the complexity of the dynamics by physical parameters other than the delay . in this work , we show that the law for generating n - scroll is directly related , and hence can be suitably controlled , by the number of peaks and troughs of the nonlinear , non - invertible function part of the system s transfer characteristic .",

    "the advantage of writing general systems in variables of linard allows us to directly observe the effect of functions associated to potentials in experimental physical systems like the optoelectronic delayed oscillator .",
    "it is well - known that a planar system , in the absence of the time - delay , can not display chaos . by adding the time - delay , @xmath35",

    "we notice in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) that the frequency of visits to potential wells depends on whether they are well - defined , i.e. , because the polynomial is not well - formed at one of its ends , results in trajectories not visiting that region too often .",
    "then the corresponding scroll will be less filled than in the other cases .",
    "we note also that the number of scrolls that can be obtained from this system will be greater the larger the degree of the polynomials are realized experimentally on the mzm .",
    "this poses a technological challenge for the implementation of arbitrarily large number of scrolls , and at the same time motivates the design of new systems with nonlinear characteristics that can provide this added benefit . in our particular setup using a jdsu-21014994 mzm we can only get up to a polynomial of degree thirteen , i.e. , sixfold - well potential , realizing a six - scroll attractor .",

    "this means , the complexity in the system is growing proportionally with laser power .",
    "however , for 5-scroll the system unexpectedly behaves more predictable , breaking the monotony in the dependence of complexity with laser power .",

    "for a well - known optoelectronic oscillator we presented a polynomial law to predict and control the generation of n - scroll chaotic attractors , based only on the system s nonlinear static characteristic . using the linard equations and phase space analysis we were able to model this electro - optical delayed feedback system , and discovered the polynomial law that generates n - scroll chaotic attractors : the polynomial functions , @xmath26 , of degree @xmath59 performed by the mzm , are associated to linard potentials , @xmath27 , described by polynomials of degree @xmath60 , which correspond to ( n/2)-scroll chaotic attractors .",
