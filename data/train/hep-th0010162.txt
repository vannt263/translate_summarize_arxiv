    "by now no one would deny that one of our most important quests is the search for the theory that unifies all the known fundamental interactions .",
    "this dream found its partial realization in the weinberg - salam - glashow model of electroweak theory . from this model one learns of the ironic yet important interplay between the requirement in one s unified theory of certain gauge symmetries , and the necessity of breaking them .",
    "one of the most original and beautiful ideas in the search of a unified theory is the assumption of the existence of extra compactified dimensions , originated from the works of nordstrm , kaluza , and klein @xcite .",
    "these compactified dimensions manifest themselves as gauge fields in flat four - dimensional spactimes .",
    "the beauty and simplicity of this idea fascinated even the great einstein , who returned to it several times in the latter part of his life @xcite .",
    "the idea , however , soon met with its demise owing to the lack of experimental evidence .",
    "it was not until the 1970s that interest in kaluza - klein theories were revived by modern attempts of unified theory such as the theories of supergravity and superstrings . in these modern theories , however , gauge fields are usually assumed to be present in higher dimensions . nevertheless , it is fair to say that the principle of gauge invariance , and the assumption of extra compactified dimensions constitute the two most important ingredients in most of the modern versions of a unified theory .",
    "more recently , in a different development , the possibility of extra dimensions has also attracted the attention of particle phenomenologists @xcite : it was argued that various unification scales might be lower than what were previously thought of , if extra dimensions exist .    inspired by the kaluza - klein scenario ,",
    "properties of gauge theories in nontrivial spacetimes have also received considerable interest during the last three decades . of the various topics considered so far",
    "an interesting one is the study of the effects of nonintegrable phases of the wilson lines . in a gauge theory on a multiply connected space , these nonintegrable phases become dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite , and have many interesting implications .",
    "they lead to a @xmath3-vacuum in qed on a circle @xcite . on toroidal spaces they induce restriction on the chern - simons term @xcite , and",
    "consequently lead to multicomponent anyon wave functions and the related braid group structures @xcite , and quantum group symmetry @xcite .",
    "last but not least , they cause dynamical gauge symmetry breaking in non - abelian gauge theory @xcite .    dynamical gauge symmetry breaking by wilson lines in a multiply connected spacetime has been studied with considerable interests since its introduction in the 1980s , and has been employed extensively in superstring phenomenology @xcite .",
    "unlike the higgs mechanism , which relies on the nonvanishing vacuum expectation values of scalar fields , the wilson line mechanism depends essentially on the nontrivial holonomy of the vacuum gauge field configuration arises from the topology of spacetime .",
    "an interesting feature of this mechanism is that fermion mass generation does not necessarily require symmetry to be broken , and vice versa .",
    "however , it is generally very difficult to compute dynamically the quantum effects ( in terms of the effective potentials ) that determine the symmetry - breaking patterns , except for a few simple compact manifolds , such as the circles @xmath4 @xcite and the torus @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "so far no computation of the effective potential has been achieved on the calabi - yau manifolds which are relevant to superstring phenomenology . to gain a better understanding of the mechanism , it is therefore useful to explore various aspects of the mechanism in simple manifolds .",
    "one interesting consideration is the inclusion of the effects of finite temperature and finite fermion density .",
    "effect of finite temperatures on wilson line symmetry breaking has been studied for circular @xcite and toroidal @xcite compactified spaces previously . in @xcite",
    "both the effects of the temperature and the fermion density are considered for the circular case ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these studies indicate that in an su(n ) gauge theory with only gauge fields and fermions in the adjoint representation of the group , higher temperatures always restore the gauge symmetry ( on the circle and torus , symmetry is not broken by this mechanism when the fermions are in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to present the general expressions of the one - loop effective potentials for the su(n ) gauge fields and the adjoint fermions on the spacetime manifold @xmath0 , with temperature and density effects taken into account .",
    "we also consider the @xmath1 dimensional case in detail , and investigate the symmetry - breaking patterns as function of the fermion density and the size of the torus at zero temperatures . even in this simple case an interesting feature already emerges , namely , the gauge symmetry can be broken and restored alternately as the density and/or the sizes of the torus change .",
    "this is something not noted in the higgs mechanism .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we give a brief review of the essence of the wilson line mechanism in sec.2 .",
    "section 3 presents the derivation of the general expressions of the effective potentials .",
    "in sec.4 the @xmath1 dimensional case is studied numerically .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "in this paper we consider an su(n ) gauge theory with adjoint fermions on a @xmath5-dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "generalizing to the case in higher dimensional torus is straightforward .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9~,\\nonumber d_\\mu\\psi=\\partial_\\mu\\psi+ig[a_\\mu,\\psi]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the space is multiplyconnected , one must specify the boundary conditions of the fields for the two noncontractible loops .",
    "let @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) label the minkowski and the toroidal coordinates , respectively , ( @xmath14 run over both @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath17 here @xmath18 are the lengths of the circumferences of @xmath19 .",
    "the phases @xmath20 represent the continuous spin structure of the manifold when using dirac fermions .",
    "these phases cancel from physical operators constructed bilinearly in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but contribute to the boundary conditions .",
    "one can then specify a particular su(n ) bundle over the torus , and determine the vacuum configuration of the connection by evaluating the effective potential for @xmath23 .",
    "however , in this paper , as in @xcite , we will confine ourselves to the trivial bundle with @xmath23 a constant element of su(n ) .",
    "even this simple case gives interesting and nontrivial results on the vacuum structure in the theory .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 in the vacuum and therefore @xmath25 this , in general , is physically distinct from @xmath26 in a multiplyconnected space , since there is no gauge transformation which connects these two configurations without spoiling the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath27 , which is undetermined in classical theory , is determined by quantum effects as a function of the boundary conditions @xmath28 up to a global gauge transformation . when the vacuum gauge configuration @xmath23 is transformed to @xmath29 ,",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath30 are rotated to @xmath31 as @xmath32 are the boundary condition matrices in the gauge @xmath33 , the residual gauge symmetry of the theory is generated by those generators of the group which commute with @xmath32 .",
    "this viewpoint of symmetry breaking was stressed by witten @xcite .",
    "one must , however , be reminded that the above argument is valid only for @xmath34 . in one - dimensional space ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 does not take on definite values because of quantum fluctuations , and therefore @xmath37 and @xmath32 are not well defined .",
    "we note that @xmath32 are related to the path - ordered wilson line integrals @xmath38 in that they have the same eigenvalues @xmath39 , the nonintegrable phases .",
    "these nonintegrable phases arise only in a topologically nontrivial space and can not be gauged away ; their values are determined dynamically .",
    "the restriction to flat connections greatly constrains the form of @xmath40 on the torus ( we assume @xmath41 on the minkowski space ) , since all components must commute .",
    "hence in general @xmath42 is a diagonal constant element of su(n ) , and we define @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the su(n ) matrix indices .",
    "one must evaluate the effective potential for @xmath23 ( or equivalently for the nonintegrable phase @xmath45 ) in order to determine the residual gauge symmetry of the system .",
    "we compute the one - loop effective potentials . for this purpose , it is convenient to take the background gauge with the gauge - fixing function @xmath46&= &   d_\\mu[\\bra a\\ket]a^\\mu\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\partial_\\mu a^\\mu + ig\\left[\\bra a_\\mu\\ket , a^\\mu\\right]\\nonumber\\\\      & = & 0~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the gauge parameter @xmath47 . after performing an analytical continuation to euclidean spacetime ,",

    "the effective potentials ( [ vg ] ) and ( [ vf ] ) can be evaluated by the zeta function method @xcite , according to which one has @xmath55 where the zeta function @xmath56 is defined according to the field contents .",
    "the next section is devoted to the evaluation of the effective potentials .",
    "the one - loop effective potentials at finite temperature and density can be evaluated according to the standard techniques in finite - temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "the imaginary - time formalism appropriate for the study of thermal equilibrium properties is adopted here . in this formalism",
    "the time coordinate is wick rotated to the euclidean time @xmath57 .",
    "the real time in the time - evolution operator @xmath58 for a hamiltonian @xmath59 is then related , by analytic continuation , to the inverse temperature @xmath60 in the boltzmann factor @xmath61 .",
    "the ( anti-)commutativity of bosonic ( fermionic ) fields then requires the fields be ( anti-)periodic in @xmath62 . the prescription of deriving the effective potential of fermions at finite density is to modify the euclidean time derivative @xmath63 by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the chemical potential of the fermions . in the following sections , we present the results of applying the above techniques to the evaluation of eqs.([vg ] ) and ( [ vf ] ) .",
