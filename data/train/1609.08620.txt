    "metallic spin - density wave ( sdw ) transitions are ubiquitous to strongly correlated materials such as the electron - doped cuprates  @xcite , the fe - based superconductors  @xcite , heavy fermion systems  @xcite , and organic superconductors  @xcite . in all these materials ,",
    "unconventional superconductivity is found to emerge near the onset of sdw order , with the maximum of the superconducting t@xmath2 occuring either at or near the underlying sdw quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "in addition , the vicinity of the sdw transition is often characterized by strong deviations from fermi liquid theory - both in thermodynamic and in single electron properties .",
    "more broadly , understanding the properties of quantum critical points ( qcps ) in itinerant fermion systems has attracted much interest over the past several decades  @xcite . unlike thermal critical phenomena and qcps in insulating systems , here",
    "the critical order parameter fluctuations are strongly interacting with low - energy fermionic quasiparticles near the fermi surface . in the traditional approach to this problem due to hertz  @xcite , later refined by millis  @xcite , the fermions are integrated out from the outset , leading to an effective _ bosonic _",
    "action for the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "the dynamics of the order parameter is found to be overdamped due to the coupling to the fermions , that act as a bath .",
    "the effective bosonic action is then treated using conventional renormalization group ( rg ) techniques . while physically appealing , this approach has the drawback that integrating out low - energy modes is dangerous , since it generates non - analytic terms in momentum and frequency that are difficult to treat within the rg scheme .",
    "an alternative popular approach has been to use a @xmath3 expansion @xcite , where @xmath4 is the number of fermion flavors .",
    "however , in the important case of two spatial dimensions , this approach turns out to be uncontrolled , as well  @xcite .",
    "alternative expansion parameters have been proposed  @xcite , but a fully controlled analytical treatment of qcps in itinerant electron systems has remained one of the grand challenges in strongly correlated electron physics .",
    "in addition to the bosonic critical fluctuation dynamics , an important open question regards the behavior of the _ fermionic _ quasiparticles in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "the exchange of sdw critical fluctuations can mediate a superconducting instability ; however , the same fluctuations also strongly scatter the quasiparticles , causing them to lose their coherence and leading to the formation of a non - fermi liquid metal .",
    "it is not clear which of these effects dominates ; i.e. , is there a well - defined non - fermi liquid regime that precedes superconductivity , or does pairing always preempt the formation of a non - fermi liquid  @xcite ?    in this work , we perform extensive numerically exact determinantal quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite of a metallic system in the vicinity of an sdw transition .",
    "we use the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , that introduced a two - dimensional multi - band lattice model that captures the generic structure of the `` hot spots '' - points on the fermi surface where quasiparticles can scatter off critical sdw fluctuations resonantly .",
    "the universal properties of metallic sdw transitions are believed to depend only on the vicinity of the hot spots . at the same time",
    ", the model is amenable to qmc simulations without a sign problem @xcite .",
    "our goal here is both to understand the generic properties of the transition , and to provide a controlled benchmark to analytic theories .",
    "we present detailed information about the bosonic and fermionic correlations and the interplay with unconventional superconductivity in the vicinity of the qcp .",
    "previously , the finite - temperature phase diagram of the model has been characterized , and a dome - shaped superconducting phase peaked near the sdw transition was found  @xcite . here",
    ", we measure the sdw correlations in the vicinity of the transition , above the superconducting @xmath1 .",
    "we find that , over a broad range of parameters , the sdw susceptibility is well described by the following form : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the ordering wavevector [ chosen to be @xmath7 in our model ] , @xmath8 is a matsubara frequency , and @xmath9 is a parameter used for tuning through the sdw qcp , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are nonuniversal constants .",
    "the function @xmath14 extrapolates to @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "importantly , eq .  ( [ eq : hertz ] ) captures the behavior of both the bosonic sdw correlations and the susceptibility of a fermion bilinear operator with the same symmetry , establishing the consistency of our analysis .",
    "interestingly , @xmath17 has precisely the form predicted by hertz and millis ; in particular , the bosonic critical dynamics are characterized by a dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath14 does not follow the predicted behavior , however . in a window of temperatures above t@xmath2",
    ", we find a power - law dependence @xmath18 with @xmath19 , in contrast to the linear behavior predicted by millis  @xcite .",
    "the single - fermion properties above @xmath1 are found to depend strongly on the distance from the hot spots .",
    "away from the hot spots , a behavior consistent with fermi liquid theory is observed . at the hot spots , a substantial loss of spectral weight",
    "is seen upon approaching the qcp . in a temperature window above t@xmath2 , the fermionic self energy is only weakly frequency and temperature dependent , corresponding to a nearly - constant lifetime of quasiparticles at the hot spots .",
    "this behavior indicates a strong breakdown of fermi liquid theory at these points .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether it represents the asymptotic behavior at the putative underlying sdw qcp , since superconductivity intervenes before the qcp is reached .    finally , in order to probe the interplay between magnetic quantum criticality and superconductivity",
    ", we measure the superconducting gap , @xmath20 , and the momentum - resolved superconducting susceptibility , @xmath21 , across the phase diagram .",
    "no strong feature is found in @xmath20 at the hot spots .",
    "rather , @xmath20 and @xmath21 vary smoothly on the fermi surface .",
    "while the pairing interaction may be strongly peaked at wavevector @xmath22 , the resulting gap function does not reflect such a strong momentum dependence .",

    "in contrast to the case of an @xmath33 order parameter ( studied in refs .",

    "an important conclusion of our study is that the sdw critical point is always masked by a superconducting phase   that we have studied , where the maximal t@xmath2 is smaller than the lowest temperature in our study , we see enhancement of diamagnetic fluctuations , indicating that we are not too far above t@xmath2 . ] . as a result",

    "as mentioned above , the sdw correlations follow a hertz - millis form  and hence it is tempting to associate with them critical exponents , i.e. a mean - field value @xmath225 for the correlation length exponent , and a dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the fermionic quasiparticles at the hot spots , however , do not exhibit this scaling behavior .",
    "in particular , the expected scaling law @xmath226 for the fermion self - energy at the hot spots is not seen within our accessible temperature range .",
    "one can imagine trying to access the `` bare '' metallic quantum critical point by suppressing the superconducting transition .",

    ", however , gives rise to a sign problem , so it is not clear whether the critical behavior can be accessed within the qmc technique .    alternatively , one could try to understand the metallic regime above t@xmath2 in our model as a crossover regime of an underlying `` nearby '' metallic critical point , where some correlators already exhibit their asymptotic behavior ( such as the sdw order parameter correlations ) , while others do not ( e.g. , the single - fermion green s function ) .",
    "interestingly , a simple , non - self consistent one - loop calculation of the fermionic self energy in our model does show a broad range of temperature and frequency where the self energy at the hot spot is nearly constant , before eventually settling into the expected @xmath227 behavior ( see appendix [ sec : perturbation_theory ] ) .",
    "this calls for a more detailed comparison between our numerically exact dqmc results and a detailed self - consistent one - loop analysis .",
    "preliminary results show that this approximation is surprisingly successful in capturing at least some of the physics of our model  @xcite .    to what extent such a crossover behavior , characterized by a nearly - constant fermionic lifetime at the hotspots ,",
    "is ubiquitous across different models , as well as in real materials , remains to be seen .",
