    "40004000  = 1000        protein folding and formation of lipid membranes and micelles are driven by hydrophobic interactions .",
    "understanding the nature of these interactions of nonpolar solutes in water and quantitatively describing them has been the topic of numerous experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . despite these efforts , a general , quantitative ,",
    "molecular scale theory is not available .",
    "motivated by information theory , we study molecular scale hydrophobic effects by exploring the thermodynamics of _ hydration _ and _ association _ of model hard core solutes@xcite where otherwise the only reliable calculational tools are elaborate computer simulations .",
    "as we will show , a simple theory based upon local density fluctuations proves sufficient to describe qualitatively _ and _ quantitatively the central hydrophobic phenomena .",
    "the theory can be applied easily to solutes of arbitrary shape and size , and permits study of structural equilibria of nonpolar molecules and residues .    among the previous theories of hydrophobic hydration , the scaled particle model @xcite initiated an important line of development .",
    "it utilizes asymptotic results in the small and large solute limits where direct information on solvent correlations is not required . in the intermediate region and for phenomena such as solvent separated",
    "hydrophobic interactions,@xcite molecular correlations are important .",
    "stillinger @xcite and others @xcite partly filled these gaps , but much remains missing in our knowledge of hydrophobic effects .",
    "our understanding of hydrophobic interactions is particularly meager .",
    "the available solubility or `` hydrophobicity '' models have not encompassed the molecular structural features that give rise to stable free energy minima with water separating hydrophobic groups  the so - called solvent separated hydrophobic interactions .",
    "thus , the hydrophobicity models have not been justified by reproducing these interactions and to this extent must be regarded as of unproven validity for conformational analysis of biomolecular structure in solution .",
    "chemical potentials of nonpolar solutes in water are the quantities of ultimate interest in the theory of hydrophobic hydration .",
    "we shall mainly be concerned with the excess chemical potential @xmath0 of a hard core solute in water .",
    "statistical mechanics relates @xmath1 to the probability @xmath2 of finding an empty volume , or _ cavity _ , of given size and shape in water at equilibrium , @xmath3 .",
    "however , @xmath2 becomes exceedingly small for larger cavities , and direct calculations of @xmath2 ( e.g. , by computer simulations using test particle insertion @xcite ) become impractical .",
    "our goal here is to provide a model to access this region of cavity sizes based upon accessible , even if indirect , information .",
    "the model we seek should not only extend the range of sizes but also apply to non - spherical cavity shapes .",
    "complete information on the binomial moments of the occupancy of a volume identical to the cavity of interest would permit a construction of @xmath2 based upon the well known expression @xcite that exactly relates @xmath2 to the fluctuations in the number @xmath4 of solvent molecules in the cavity region : @xmath5 this formula is useful in guiding the analysis of theories@xcite but becomes impractical for larger cavities because of its sensitivity to missing information .",
    "in those instances , higher binomial moments can not be neglected and that information is unavailable .",
    "we require an approach that is less sensitive to missing information while exploiting information readily available for cavities of _ all _ sizes and shapes .",
    "these are the low order moments of the number @xmath4 of solvent molecules in the cavity volume @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the water oxygen pair correlation function and @xmath9 is the water density .",
    "information theory @xcite provides a paradigm for exploiting such quantities .",
    "we consider the set of probabilities @xmath10 of finding exactly @xmath4 solvent molecules in the cavity volume , @xmath11 .",
    "observation of no solvent molecules in the cavity region is then just one of the elementary events , and @xmath2 is just one of the desired probabilities .",
    "we formulate models of the distribution @xmath10 that satisfy known moments , eqs .",
    "[ eq : m1 ] and [ eq : m2 ] . minimizing an information measure permits the inference of probabilities of maximum likelihood in a sampling experiment that satisfies the moment information@xcite .",
    "however , the accurately parabolic character of @xmath12 for cavity volumes of small molecular size , observed in computer simulations of water @xcite , suggests an even simpler model : we adopt the form @xmath13 with `` lagrange multipliers '' @xmath14 to be determined by the three moment conditions @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . from this",
    "we extract the @xmath2 that provides the desired thermodynamic result .",
    "figure [ fig : sphere ] shows the chemical potential for a spherical cavity in water calculated from the model as well as from direct cavity statistics .",
    "we find excellent agreement in the range considered .",
    "this simple theory based entirely on the pair correlation function of water is capable of reproducing the thermodynamics of cavity formation in the region that is accessible to direct computer simulations @xcite .",
    "so far , we considered the _",
    "hydrophobic hydration _ of a single cavity .",
    "we now proceed to study _",
    "hydrophobic interactions_. the free energy associated with bringing together two hydrophobic solutes corresponds to a distance dependent potential of mean force ( pmf ) .",
    "the developed methodology provides us with the means of calculating this pmf .",
    "given the first and second moment of the particle number distribution , an approximate chemical potential @xmath17 can be determined for forming a cavity made of two spheres with given radius @xmath18 and distance @xmath19 using the model .",
    "the pmf is then defined as @xmath20 .    in the following , we study the association of two cavities of methane size in water . for the radius of the spheres , we have chosen a value of @xmath21  nm .",
    "this radius corresponds to the smallest distance where methane - water pair correlations reach 1.0 in commonly employed models @xcite .",
    "the cavity pmf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmf ] . as a reference",
    ", the cavity potential produced by the molecular dynamics simulation of smith and haymet @xcite is included .",
    "we obtained this by subtracting the bare potential from the pmf of methane association .",
    "again , we find qualitative and quantitative agreement between our simple model and elaborate computer simulations .",
    "our cavity pmf shows a strongly favored region with overlapping cavities , separated by a distinct barrier from a solvent separated , stable minimum at about 0.7  nm distance , in agreement with the computer simulations for methane association .",
    "in addition , we observe a very shallow third minimum at 1.1  nm distance .    as a last example",
    ", we study the torsional equilibrium of @xmath4-butane . figure  [ fig : butane ] shows the cavity pmf as a function of the torsional angle @xmath22 , which is compared to explicit computer simulation results of beglov and roux @xcite . in complete agreement with the computer simulations , we find that the more compact cis ( @xmath23 ) and gauche structures ( @xmath24 ) are favored over the extended trans conformation ( @xmath25 ) by about 1.8  kj  mol@xmath26 and 0.7  kj  mol@xmath26 , respectively .    when the cavities of interest are much larger than the size of the solvent molecules , other physical considerations intrude , as is well known in the scaled particle developments@xcite .",
    "we expect this two moment model to become unsufficient as a sole description in those cases .",
    "nevertheless , a broad range of problems of biological interest , such as interactions of ligands with binding sites , effects of point mutations on protein - solvent interactions , and conformational equilibria of side chains , is within the range of applicability of this model .",
    "the present theory permits a sound , quantitative understanding of hydrophobic hydration and association processes .",
    "this view is based upon ( i )  the simplicity of the present theory involving only particle number fluctuations , ( ii )  the small amount of input information required [ @xmath8 ] that is experimentally accessible , ( iii )  the computational ease of evaluating the theory permitting application to realistically large and complex shaped solutes , ( iv )  the unified and consistent treatment of hydrophobic hydration and interaction phenomena , ( v )  the clear connection of information theory to basic statistical thermodynamics , and ( vi )  the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of the theoretical predictions in a range that is otherwise inaccessible to direct theoretical treatment .",
    "the differences between the actual interactions of nonpolar solutes with the solvent and the hard core interactions studied here can be treated in a subsequent step .",
    "see , for example , l.  r. pratt and d. chandler , , 3434 ( 1980 ) .",
    "the relative incompressibility of water is reflected in a small variance of particle - number fluctuations in macroscopic volumes , which is related to the isothermal compressibility @xmath28 through @xmath29 .",
    "for an ideal gas , @xmath30 is 1 ; for water it is 0.06 .",
