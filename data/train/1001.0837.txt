    "it is by now experimentally well established that magnetic static and dynamical properties of high-@xmath1 cuprates are quite anomalous . early inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments on low - doped la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) @xcite revealed that local , i.e. , * q*-integrated dynamic spin response in the normal state ( ns ) exhibits anomalous @xmath0 scaling , not reflected in instantaneous spin - spin correlation length @xmath5 which shows no significant @xmath6-dependence below room temperature . subsequently similar behaviour has been found in a number of other compounds , i.e. , in underdoped ybacu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco ) and in zn - doped ybco @xcite .",
    "more recent ins experiments on heavily underdoped ( ud ) cuprates , including li - doped lsco @xcite , ybco @xcite , and pr@xmath9lace@xmath3cuo@xmath10 ( plcco ) @xcite , confirm the universal features of anomalous ns spin dynamics so that @xmath0 scaling is found in a broad range both in @xmath11-integrated susceptibility @xmath12 @xcite and in @xmath13 at the commensurate afm @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath15 is a lorentzian with the characteristic relaxation rate scaling as @xmath16 , but with a nonuniversal @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath18 has been used @xcite , with @xmath19 $ ] and material dependent @xmath20 .",
    "it has been also observed that at low @xmath21 some intensity is gradually transfered into a central peak ( cp ) @xcite whereas the inelastic response saturates .",
    "this _ freezing _ mechanism appears to be entirely dynamical in origin since @xmath5 as well as the integrated intensity are unaffected by the crossover .",
    "the present authors introduced a theory of spin dynamics in doped afm @xcite which describes the scaling behavior as a dynamical phenomenon based on two experimental observations : a ) @xmath5 is ( almost ) independent of @xmath6 , and b ) the system is metallic with finite spin collective - mode damping .",
    "then the system close to afm naturally exhibits @xmath0 scaling in a wide energy range , with saturation at low - enough @xmath6 .",
    "our starting point in the analysis of recent ins experiments is the dynamical spin susceptibilty @xcite @xmath22 where the spin stiffness @xmath23  mev ) is only weakly @xmath24-dependent ( @xmath25 is the exchange coupling ) , @xmath26 is an effective collective mode frequency , @xmath27 is the static susceptibility and @xmath28 is ( the complex ) memory function containing information on collective mode damping @xmath29 . in the ns of cuprates low - frequency collective modes at @xmath30",

    "have low charge - carrier concentration but pronounced spin fluctuations whose dynamics is quite generally governed by the sum rule @xmath35 where @xmath36 is strongly peaked at @xmath37 with a characteristic width @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the total sum rule is for a system with local magnetic moments ( spin @xmath39 ) given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an effective ( hole ) doping .    while the formalism so far is very general , we now introduce approximations specific to ud cuprates @xcite .",
    "ins experiments listed above indicate that within the ns the effective @xmath11 width of @xmath42 , i.e. , dynamical @xmath43 , is only weakly @xmath6- and @xmath44-dependent , even on entering the regime with the    cp response @xcite . within further analysis",
    "we assume the commensurate afm response at @xmath37 and the double - lorentzian form @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] although qualitative results at low @xmath44 do not depend on a particular form of @xmath36 .",
    "we also assume that the damping @xmath46 is dominated by particle - hole excitations being only weakly @xmath11 and @xmath44 dependent .",
    "hence @xmath47 , with @xmath34 a phenomenological parameter . the assumption of constant @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ chiq ] ) then leads to @xmath48 note that recent ins data are fully consistent with this form which has been used to extract @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we next exploit the sum rule , eq.([eqsum ] ) , to determine @xmath50 .",
    "as shown elsewhere @xcite @xmath32 is mainly determined by the parameter @xmath51 subject to @xmath52 which is experimentally relevant .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  1 for a range of @xmath53 .",

    "all these @xmath17 require rather large @xmath33 , which implies very low saturation @xmath67 , whereas ins data for ybco and lsco indicate quite substantial @xmath67 . however , saturation of @xmath32 , setting in for @xmath21 , is accompanied by simultaneous appearance of the cp which absorbs the ` missing ' sum rule .    in fig .  2 ins measurements by hinkov et al",
    "@xcite on ud ybco with @xmath68 @xcite are presented together with theoretical curves were the only relevant parameter is @xmath69 , while in fig .",
    "3 theoretical scaling function @xmath70 for the same @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 ) is plotted .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and experiment ( fig .",
    "2 ) is quite satisfactory .",
    "the agreement is less satisfactory for @xmath71mev and should be attributed to the breakdown of scaling since @xmath72 , as also evident in fig .",
    "note that the _ ad hoc _ ansatz for @xmath57 commonly used ( with @xmath73 ) can be easily obtained assuming a lorentzian dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath24 .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath75 with @xmath76 , provided that @xmath77 but @xmath78 const ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the advantage of the memory - function formalism is that the emergence of the cp at @xmath21 in the spin response can be as well treated within the same framework .",
    "one has to assume that unlike in a paramagnet the mode damping @xmath79 is not constant but may acquire an additional low frequncy contribution .",
    "in particular we can take @xmath80 , with @xmath6-dependent @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which leads to @xmath13 of the form used also to analyse experimental ins data for ybco with @xmath83 @xcite .    for @xmath84 but",
    "@xmath85 the modified @xmath86 leads to two distinct energy scales and hence to two contributions to spin dynamics , i.e. , the cp part @xmath87 and the regular contribution @xmath88 , @xmath89 valid for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "thus , below @xmath92 new scales are set by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath81 saturates at low @xmath6 , as is manifest by saturation of @xmath97 @xcite , @xmath98 becomes the smallest energy scale , resulting in a quasielastic peak of width @xmath99 .",
    "the saturation of @xmath97 , although at present unclear physically , is responsible for the transfer of spectral weight , since @xmath100 @xcite , which is again consistent with experiment on @xmath83 ybco @xcite .",
    "the approach presented gives a consistent explanation of the @xmath0 scaling both in @xmath101 as well as in @xmath102 .",
    "it is based on two well established experimental facts : the overdamped nature of the response and the saturation of @xmath103 at low @xmath44 and @xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of the cp for @xmath21 is easily incorporated into the formalism via the ( almost ) singular @xmath44- and @xmath6-dependent damping @xmath104 .",
    "however , the question as to the origin of cp remains to be settled .",
