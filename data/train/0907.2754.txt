    "two of the most mysterious aspects in modern particle physics are the masses and mixings of the elementary fermions and the number of fermion generations in nature : the flavour problem .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) , in which each family is anomalyfree by itself , does not fix the number of generations except by the indirect bound coming from the asymptotic freedom of qcd according to which this number must be less than 9 . on the other hand it is known , on the theoretical side , that the flavor democracy approach @xcite and some mechanisms of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite favor the existence of a fourth family , and , on the experimental side , that precision electroweak data do not totally exclude it @xcite .",
    "moreover , two and even three additional generations could also be allowed @xcite . however , in the sm , the lep data on invisible z boson decay show that there are three sm families with light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "two alternative scenarios , which provide some insight for the solution of this puzzle by relating the number of generations to the cancellation of chiral anomalies , have been proposed in the literature . in one of them",
    "anomalies constrain the number of generations provided their cancellation takes place either in a nonsupersymmetric @xmath3 theory that lives in a six - dimensional spacetime @xcite , or in a sixdimensional ( @xmath4 ) supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite . in the other one the sm",
    "is extended either to the gauge group @xmath5 ( the 3 - 3 - 1 model ) @xcite or to the gauge symmetry @xmath6 ( the 3 - 4 - 1 model ) @xcite , with anomalies cancelling among the families ( three - family models ) and not family by family as in the sm . in the 3 - 3 - 1 extension",
    "this happens only if we have an equal number of left - handed triplets and antitriplets , taking into account the color degree of freedom .",
    "correspondingly , an equal number of 4-plets and @xmath7-plets is required in the 3 - 4 - 1 extension .",
    "as a consequence , the number of fermion families @xmath8 must be divisible by the number of colors @xmath9 of @xmath10 , being @xmath11 the simplest solution .    one additional motivation to study the second scenario comes from the fact that it has been recently recognized as the simplest sm extension required for the implementation of the little higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "even though we will not be concerned here with this alternative proposal to solve the so - called hierarchy problem , we notice that in the simplest little higgs scenario the sm gauge group is enlarged to @xmath12 .",
    "this model , however , lacks a quartic higgs coupling which can be generated in a @xmath13 extension @xcite .",
    "the complete anomaly - free fermion sector for these two little higgs models has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , with direct generalization to @xmath14 with @xmath15 but , at present , there is not motivation to go beyond @xmath16 .",
    "conspicuously , in the little higgs scenario both the 3 - 3 - 1 extension and the 3 - 4 - 1 one are three - family models in which all the exotic fermion fields have only ordinary electric charges .    in this paper we will be involved with the 3 - 4 - 1 extension of the sm . in this regard",
    ", a recent systematic analysis has shown that , by restricting the fermion field representations to particles without exotic electric charges ( that is , electric charges different from @xmath17 and @xmath18 for exotic quarks and different from 0 and @xmath19 for exotic leptons ) and by paying due attention to anomaly cancellation , a few different models are obtained ; while by relaxing the condition of nonexistence of exotic electric charges , an infinite number of models can be generated @xcite .",
    "the restriction to ordinary electric charges in the fermion , gauge boson and scalar sectors , allows only for two different possibilities for the simultaneous values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the most general expression for the electric charge generator in @xmath13 @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 are the gell - mann matrices for @xmath25 normalized as tr@xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the diagonal @xmath28 unit matrix , and @xmath29 gives the usual isospin of the electroweak interaction .",
    "these possibilities are : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which become a convenient classification scheme for these type of models .",
    "four of the identified models without exotic electric charges are three - family models .",
    "two of them are models for which @xmath30 and have been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the other two models belong to the class for which @xmath31 and have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "3 - 4 - 1 models containing exotic electric charges have been also considered in the literature @xcite . in this case",
    "a particular embedding of the sm gauge group into @xmath0 depends on the physical motivation of the model to be constructed . the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , has been proposed with the goal of including right - handed neutrinos in the fermion spectrum from the start .",
    "models based on the @xmath0 gauge symmetry predict the existence of three massive neutral currents which mix with each other .",
    "they are , the usual neutral current of the sm associated to the @xmath32 gauge boson , and two new associated to the gauge bosons @xmath33 and @xmath34 . unlike models containing exotic electric charges , for models with only ordinary electric charges the mixing can be constrained to occur between @xmath32 and @xmath33 only @xcite .",
    "this fact produces an enormous simplification in the study of the low energy deviations of the @xmath32 couplings to the sm families @xcite . on the other hand , after the breakdown of the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry down to @xmath35 , the left - handed couplings of quarks to the sm @xmath32 boson remain flavor conserving ( at low energies the model coincides with the sm ) ; but , since anomaly cancellation among generations forces one family of quarks to transform differently from the other two , the left - handed couplings of quarks both to @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , in general , not flavor diagonal .",
    "consequently , flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) arise .    with a family of quarks transforming differently under @xmath13",
    ", we have three possible assignments of weak eigenstates into mass eigenstates .",
    "as we will see , the phenomenological implications of the model will depend on the choice of the quark family being different .",
    "in this work we will constrain ourselves to the case where the mixing occurs between @xmath32 and @xmath33 only , with @xmath36 being a mass eigenstate @xcite . then , for two different 3 - 4 - 1 models , one of them representative of the @xmath37 class and the other one representative of the @xmath38 class , we do a @xmath39 fit to z - pole observables and atomic parity violation ( apv ) data in order to constraint the mixing angle @xmath40 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the mass scale @xmath1 of the corresponding physical new neutral gauge boson",
    ". the main purpose will be to examine how much these bounds depend on the three different assignments of quark gauge eigenstates into mass eigenstates .",
    "next , for the same two different 3 - 4 - 1 models and for the three possible assignments , we will impose constraints on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 coming from neutral meson mixing in the analysis of the fcnc effects present in the models .",
    "the outcome of the analysis will be then used to establish which quark family must transform differently in order to keep the lower bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath2 as low as possible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the 3 - 4 - 1 models to be studied with the emphasis done on the aspects relevant to the analysis proposed in the previous paragraph . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] we use electroweak measurements at the z - pole , apv data and experimental input from neutral meson mixing in order to obtain family - dependent bounds on the parameters of the models .",

    "as stated , we will consider models without exotic electric charges based on the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry , each one characterized by the values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the electric charge operator in eq .",

    "a the three different assignments give three different allowed regions in the parameter space @xmath74 ( obtained from a fit to z - pole observables and to apv data ) , thus producing different predictions for the lower bound on the @xmath78 mass and for the range of values of the @xmath108 mixing angle @xmath40 .",
    "these bounds have been further constrained by using experimental data from neutral meson mixing in the analysis of fcnc effects associated to quark family nonuniversality . for their study",
    "we have assumed the fritzsch ansatz for the quark mixing matrix .",
    "the resulting new bounds show family dependence through the entries of the quarks mass matrices @xmath109 and @xmath69 to be replaced into the formulas for the mass differences in the @xmath76 , @xmath73 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 systems ( see eqs .",
    "( [ mdifk ] ) , ( [ mdifb ] ) and ( [ mdifd ] ) ) . combining both type of constraints leads to the conclusion that the heaviest family of quarks must transform differently in order to have a lower bound on @xmath1 as small as possible . for model",
    "a the smallest lower bound comes from the @xmath73 system and turns out to be @xmath110 tev , which raises in 1 order of magnitude the lower bound @xmath111 tev obtained from the allowed region in the parameter space @xmath74 .",
    "it must be , in any case , recognized that the bounds from neutral meson mixing are always obscured by the lack of knowledge of the mixing matrix entries and by the rather arbitrary assumed contribution of the @xmath78 exchange to the mass differences .",
    "model b has the particular feature that , notwithstanding two families of quarks transform differently under the @xmath25 subgroup , the three families have the same hypercharge @xmath112 with respect to the @xmath50 subgroup . as a consequence , the couplings of the fermion fields to the neutral currents @xmath105 and @xmath78 are family universal .",
    "thus , the allowed region in the parameter space @xmath74 is the same for the three different assignments of quark symmetry eigenstates into quark mass eigenstates , and gives the family - independent bounds : @xmath113 tev and @xmath114 . since fcnc are present for this model in the left - handed couplings of ordinary quarks to the @xmath97 gauge boson , the contribution of the @xmath97 exchange to the mass differences in neutral meson mixing produces the family - dependent constraints on the @xmath97 mass given in eqs .",
    "( [ lowerbb1 ] ) , ( [ lowerbb2 ] ) and ( [ lowerbb3 ] ) .",
    "these results allows us to conclude that , like in model a , the third family of quarks must transform differently in order to get , in this case , the smallest lower bound on @xmath2 which comes from the @xmath73 system and turns out to be @xmath101 tev . since @xmath103 @xmath104 ,",
    "this is also a lower bound on the scale of breaking of the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry .",
    "as mentioned above , it must be stressed that the bound on @xmath2 depends on inputs which are not dictated by the present experimental data , namely , the assumed ansatz for the quark mass matrices entries and the assumed contribution of the @xmath97 exchange to the mass differences in the neutral meson mixing systems .",
    "the convenience of distinguishing the heaviest family of quarks could give some indication as to why the top quark is unbalancingly heavy .",
    "a comparison of the predictions from the two classes of 3 - 4 - 1 models without exotic electric charges shows that models for which @xmath38 are preferred in the sense that they give lower bounds on the mass of the new neutral gauge bosons @xmath78 and @xmath97 smaller than the ones predicted by models in the @xmath37 class .",
    "in fact , first , the family - independent lower bound @xmath115 tev in model b is not affected by the constraints coming from fcnc data and is just below the tev scale and , second , providing the third family of quarks transforms differently , the lower bound on the @xmath97 mass is @xmath101 tev , a value at the reach of the cern lhc capability .",
    "this means that the @xmath38 class of models have a better chance to be tested at the lhc facility or further at the ilc .",
    "even though we have constrained ourselves to the particular case @xmath116 , for which the mixing is present between the neutral gauge bosons @xmath32 and @xmath107 only , the analysis presented shows clearly the main purpose of this work , that is , the dependence of the predictions of 3 - 4 - 1 models on the possible quark family assignments associated to quark family nonuniversality .",
    "the extension to the general case of mixing between the three neutral currents present in the models would complicate the mathematical and numerical analysis , but the general conclusions regarding family - dependence of the phenomenology of 3 - 4 - 1 models would be the same .    finally we note that , in order to make evident the effects of quark family nonuniversality , we have quoted only the lower bounds on @xmath1 in eqs .",
    "( [ bounda1])-([boundsb ] ) . as it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , the @xmath39 fit also produces finite upper bounds on @xmath1 which depend on the allowed value of the mixing angle @xmath40 , except in the limit @xmath117 where @xmath1 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this is a characteristic feature both of 3 - 3 - 1 and 3 - 4 - 1 models without exotic electric charges associated to the fact that , if we consider the basic field content only , then the renormalization group equation analysis shows that , for all these models , the scale of gauge coupling unification @xmath118 can be as high as the planck scale .",
    "this result can be modified in the 3 - 3 - 1 extension , for example , by considering @xmath119 as a covering group , and by introducing new physics at a scale @xmath120 ( where @xmath121 is the scale of the 3 - 3 - 1 symmetry breaking ) in the form of an enlargement of the scalar sector with an appropriate large number of higgs fields that do not develop vacuum expectation values ( for details see ref .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative approach ) .",
    "this , clearly , prevents us to directly from getting an upper bound on the scale of the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry breaking from the fit .",
    "also , the constraints coming from fcnc processes allows us to put only lower bounds on the mass of the new neutral gauge bosons .",
    "then , if we look only to these constraints , the 3 - 4 - 1 theory we have studied is not more predictive than generic grand unified theories where fcnc may also be suppressed by large masses .",
    "notice , however , that bounds on other parameters can be obtained by examining additional phenomenological consequences of the model .",
    "for example , by taking into account that the 3 - 4 - 1 extension predicts new heavy particles and , provided these new particles feel the electroweak interaction , they should give corrections to electroweak precision measurements through their effects on the @xmath122 and @xmath32 vacuum polarization amplitudes , which are usually expressed in terms of the oblique @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 parameters . it can be shown that in the general case @xmath126 , the symmetry breaking pattern in eq .",
    "( [ break ] ) induces mass splitting between the new heavy gauge bosons different from @xmath33 and @xmath127 , and mass splitting between the extra heavy higgs fields arising from the diagonalization of the scalar sector @xcite , so these new particles may give no negligible contributions to the oblique parameters .",
    "a detailed study of these contributions , which we postpone to a future work , will enable us to put upper and lower bounds on their masses .",

    "<S> flavor changing neutral currents arise in the @xmath0 extension of the standard model because anomaly cancellation among the fermion families requires one generation of quarks to transform differently from the other two under the gauge group . in the weak basis </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between quark families is meaningless . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the mass eigenstates basis , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix motivates us to classify left - handed quarks in families . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> there are , in principle , three different assignments of quark weak eigenstates into mass eigenstates . in this work , by using measurements at the z - pole , atomic parity violation data and experimental input from neutral meson mixing , we examine two different models without exotic electric charges based on the 3 - 4 - 1 symmetry , and address the effects of quark family nonuniversality on the bounds on the mixing angle between two of the neutral currents present in the models and on the mass scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the new neutral gauge bosons predicted by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the heaviest family of quarks must transform differently in order to keep lower bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath2 as low as possible without violating experimental constraints . </S>"
