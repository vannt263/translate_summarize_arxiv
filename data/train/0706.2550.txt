    "the presence of non local correlations in the joint photocounts probabilities of frequency entangled photons in two spatially separated mach - zender interferometers was detected by franson more than a decade ago@xcite . in his experimental setup ,",
    "widely known now as franson interferometer , two frequency entangled photons emitted by a two photon cascade or a type i down conversion process were sent to the input of two spatially separated mach - zender ( m - z ) interferometers .",
    "the joint photocount statistics showed non local correlations with strong similarities to the ones shown in test of bell inequalities .",
    "such example of higher order interference has been since after widely analyzed both theoretically and experimentally @xcite and has been proposed as a scheme for the implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols @xcite .    given two pairs of entangled systems , @xmath0 and @xmath1 it is possible to generate entanglement between systems @xmath2 by a suitable joint measurement on systems @xmath3 .",
    "such scheme is known as entanglement swapping and it has been first proposed in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we suggest an experimental scheme for the implementation of entanglement swapping between two franson interferometers .",
    "our scheme consists of two type i sources of pairs of downconverted frequency entangled photons .",
    "one photon for each pair is sent to a m - z interferometer while the two remaining photons are mixed at a beam splitter and then detected as in a typical ou - mandel interferometer @xcite .",
    "we show that for suitably postelected joint measurements of the photons leaving the beam splitter , the joint measurements at the two m - z show non local correlations similar to the ones characteristic of the franson interferometer .",
    "an experiment in a similar spirit has been carried out with time bin entangled photons @xcite .",
    "we will show that our scheme , closer to the original franson setup , although requires brighter sources of entangled photons , requires less synchronization .    in the next section we will review briefly , for the sake of completeness , the properties of our frequency entangled two photon state and of the franson interferometer while in section [ ugo ] we will illustrate our proposal .",
    "the output state of a the signal and idle modes of a type i parametric down conversion process can approximately written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 label two particular wavevector direction .",
    "if the nonlinear crystal is pumped at a frequency @xmath7 the probability amplitude function @xmath8 shows pairwise entanglement between the modes around the frequency @xmath9 and takes the form @xmath10 where , to a good approximation @xcite , @xmath11 the state ( [ stato emesso ] ) can therefore be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fourier transform of @xmath14 .",
    "if we assume that the bandwidth @xmath15 of populated frequencies is large , the photon wavefunction becomes @xmath16 the physical interpretation of eqs.([stato emesso in tt],[state in t ] ) is straightforward : the pairs of correlated photons are emitted with a constant probability amplitude .",
    "once a photon in one mode - say @xmath5 - is detected at time @xmath17 , the probability amplitude to detect a photon in mode @xmath6 collapses to a packet of time width @xmath18 . in the broadband limit @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. the photons are emitted in simultaneous pairs .     and @xmath20 and two output modes @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the modes are mixed by symmetric @xmath23 beam splitters .",
    "the two arms of the interferometer have different optical length @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectivelly .",
    "an additional phase shift @xmath26 can be experimentally introduced ]     are injected into two spatially separated m - z interferometers , width=340 ]    assume now that the photons in mode @xmath5 and @xmath6 are injected in one of the input of two spatially separated m - z interferometers , as shown in fig.([franson interferometer ] ) . writing ( [ stato emesso in omega ] ) as    @xmath27 )    @xmath28    the wave functions ( [ stato emesso in omega ] ) can be expressed in terms of the output modes of the two interferometers , labeled as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and takes the forms    @xmath33    from the above equation , using the standard photodetection theory , it is possible to obtain the joint probability distribution @xmath34 that a photon is detected at detector @xmath35 at time @xmath17 and a photon at the output @xmath36 at time @xmath37 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that either the two detectors @xmath38 register a simultaneous event or they register two events separated by delay time @xmath39 .",
    "the simultaneous detections show a non local dependence on the phase settings of the two interferometers .",
    "these results can be easily understood by noting that the two photons are emitted simultaneously and are localized packets of duration @xmath19 .",
    "each photon can reach the photodetectors via two possible paths , namely the long ( @xmath40 ) and the short ( @xmath41 ) arm of the interferometer . to each path",
    "is attached a probability amplitude with a phase factor which depend on the optical path and on the local phase .",
    "the photons can reach the photodetectors @xmath38 along the following paths : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , fig .",
    "( [ shortlong ] ) and @xmath44 , @xmath45 fig .",
    "( [ ll ] ) . since the wavepackets are well localized , i.e. since @xmath46 , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 paths are distinguishable and are responsible of detection events separated by a time interval @xmath49 .",
    "as a consequence    @xmath50     , title=\"fig : \" ]   , title=\"fig : \" ]    [ shortlong ]    on the other hand the paths @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are responsible of simultaneous joint photodetections ( see fig .",
    "[ ll ] ) , are indistinguishable since , although it is known that the two photons enter simultaneously the two interferometers , their exact emission time is unknown .",
    "the consequence of such indistinguishability is interference between the probability amplitudes associated to such paths .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the probabilities of joint simultaneous photocounts are    @xmath53    note how the simultaneous joint photocounts ( [ joint1],[joint2 ] ) show a non local dependence of the local phase settings of the two spatially separated interferometers strongly reminiscent on the joint probabilities characteristic of bell - inequality test experiments . as mentioned",
    "his has suggested the possible application of the franson setup for quantum cryptographic applications @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show how such non local correlations can be swapped between two distinct pairs of entangled photons which never interacted .",
    "the key idea of entanglement swapping @xcite is the following : given two separate maximally entangled pair of particles @xmath0 and @xmath54 , if we perform a joint bell mesurement on particles @xmath3 , then particles @xmath2 are projected in a maximally entangled state , although they never interacted in the past . following the above idea",
    "consider two independent non linear crystals emitting separate pairs of frequency entangled photons .",
    "one may wonder if by means of a suitable joint measurement on pairs of photons , each emitted by a separate source , it is possible to reproduce the nonlocal franson interference pattern with the remaining two photons .",
    "we will show that this is indeed possible .     and emit independent pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 of entangled photons .",
    "photons @xmath6 and @xmath55 are mixed at a symmetric beam splitter and the detected by detectors @xmath56 and @xmath57,width=340 ]    in fig.([setup ] ) is sketched the proposed setup .",
    "a strong pump field at frequency @xmath7 stimulates the spontaneous emission of pairs of parametric downconverted photons @xmath0 and @xmath1 by two separate crystals .",
    "photons in modes @xmath6 and @xmath55 are mixed at a beam splitter and detected - i.e. are sent in a ou mandel interferometer @xcite , while photons in modes @xmath5 and @xmath20 are sent to two separate m - z interferometers .",
    "let us first give a pictorial intuition of the effect of the measurement on photons @xmath3 on the state of photons @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that two photons are detected in @xmath58 at a time interval @xmath59 and assume @xmath60 in order to neglect any bunching in the photocounts . as we have discussed in the previous section any measurement on one photon of an entangled pair localizes in time the other photon of the pair .",
    "in other words detecting photon @xmath6 at time @xmath17 gives information on the emission time of the entangled pair and therefore of photon @xmath5 .",
    "however , since a photon detected in @xmath56 or in @xmath57 could have come from @xmath6 or @xmath55 , it is not known if the collapse of the photon wavefunction took place in mode @xmath5 or in mode @xmath20 . when two photons are detected at time @xmath17 and @xmath61 it is certain",
    "that both the state of mode @xmath5 and @xmath20 have collapsed , but it is not possible to know in which order .",
    "therefore the state of modes @xmath2 is a coherent superposition of two wavepackets at a distance @xmath59 , as shown in fig.([project ] ) . in more mathematical terms ,",
    "the wavefunction of the two pairs of photons is    @xmath62    where in the last equation we have expressed modes @xmath3 in terms of the photodetector modes @xmath58 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that when two photons are detected at time @xmath17 and @xmath61 on the same photodector ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) , the wavefunction of the photon pair in @xmath2 collapses to    @xmath65    while if the photons are detected in different photodetectors , @xmath58 and @xmath66 the wavefunction of modes @xmath2 collapses to @xmath67 in both cases we have a coherent superposition of two wavepackets separated by a time interval @xmath59 .",
    "note incidentally that if @xmath68 we observe buncing . indeed in this case",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i.e. we do not have an entangled superposition of localized photon wavepackets .     at @xmath17 and @xmath61 .",
    "this collapses the wavefunction of modes @xmath2 into a coherent superposition of two wavepackets separated by a time interval @xmath59 , width=340 ]     shown at the left and at the right of the present figure enters the two mz interferometers . when the time delay between the input pulses @xmath59 differs from the time delay",
    "@xmath39 the two sequences of output pulses are distinct an therefore distinguishable . for the sake of simplicity here",
    "we have drawn the sequence of pulses at detectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the same sequence of pulses reaches detectors @xmath30 and @xmath74,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]   shown at the left and at the right of the present figure enters the two mz interferometers . when the time delay between the input pulses @xmath59 differs from the time delay @xmath39 the two sequences of output pulses are distinct an therefore distinguishable .",
    "for the sake of simplicity here we have drawn the sequence of pulses at detectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the same sequence of pulses reaches detectors @xmath30 and @xmath74,title=\"fig : \" ]    when a short single photon wavepacket enters a m - z interferometer one observes a sequence of two pulses separated in time by an interval @xmath39 with equal probability at each of the two output detectors i.e. each pulse may reach the output either along the long or the short arm of the interferometer : @xmath75 in our case a coherent superstition of two wavepachets separated in time by @xmath59 enters the two interferometers @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "since , as shown in fig.([input ] ) the two sequences of output pulses which originate are distinguishable no nonlocal interference effect like the one described in the previous section can be observed .",
    "this is however is no no longer true when @xmath76 . in this case , as shown in fig.([overlap ] ) , some pulses may have reached the output via two indistinguishable paths and therefore one expects the appearance of a non local interference pattern similar to the one which characterizes the franson interfereometer .",
    "in particular the event associated with pulse @xmath5 propagating along the short arm and pulse @xmath20 propagating along the long arm is indistinguishable from the event associated with pulse @xmath20 propagating along the short arm and pulse @xmath5 propagating along the long arm .",
    "this leads to the following joint simultaneous photocount probabilities : @xmath77 the above photocount probabilitie eq.([p1],[p2 ] ) show strong similarities and some differences with the photocout probabilities of the original fraqnson experiment , eq.([joint1])([joint2 ] ) . in both cases there",
    "is a non local dependence on the phase settings of the spatially separated mz interferometers . in both cases",
    "the joint simultaneous photocounts are modulated by the phase difference between the two interfering paths . in ( [ joint1],[joint2 ] )",
    "such phase is @xmath78 , i.e. the phase difference between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 while in ( [ p1])([p2 ] ) the modulating phase is @xmath79 i.e. the phase difference between the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 paths .",
    "the reason of such difference is that while in the original franson setup the input photon pairs are delocalized in time , in our scheme they are localized in two wavepackets separated in time by @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore the ( [ p1])([p2 ] ) depend on wether the input state is @xmath80 or @xmath81 i.e. on wether the photons at the ou - mandel interferometer are detected in the same detector on on different detectors .",
    "shown at the left and at the right of the present figure enters the two mz interferometers .",
    "when the time delay between the input pulses @xmath59 equals the time delay @xmath39 the simultaneous output pulse may originate either from the left or the right sequence of input pulse which are indistinguishable . for the sake of simplicity here we have drawn the sequence of pulses at detectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the same sequence of pulses reaches detectors @xmath30 and @xmath74,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]   shown at the left and at the right of the present figure enters the two mz interferometers .",
