    "t tauri stars are low - mass ( @xmath2 m@xmath0 ) pre - main sequence objects , thought to be early analogs of stars like our own sun . a wealth of evidence , including direct imaging at millimeter and optical wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and modeling of spectral energy distributions ( seds ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has confirmed the long - espoused hypothesis that t tauri stars are surrounded by massive disks of dust and gas . moreover , observed line profiles and uv continuum excesses indicate that t tauri stars are actively accreting material from their circumstellar disks .",
    "the structure of the innermost disk regions may reveal the mechanism by which material is accreted through the disk onto the star . in the current paradigm ,",
    "t tauri disks are truncated by the stellar magnetosphere within the co - rotation radius , with material accreting along magnetic field lines onto high - latitude regions of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for typical t tauri star masses , radii , magnetic field strengths , and accretion rates , predicted truncation radii range from @xmath3 au .",
    "observational measurements of these truncation radii are an obviously important test of the theory of magnetospheric accretion .    the spatial and temperature structures of inner circumstellar disks are also important for understanding the properties of dust and gas in the terrestrial planet region , and ultimately for understanding the formation of planets .",
    "for example , a puffed - up inner disk wall , due to the normal angle of incidence of stellar radiation on the truncated inner edge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may lead to shadowing , and thus cooler temperatures in the inner disk compared to standard flat or flared disk temperature profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this , in turn , would have profound implications as to how and where terrestrial planets form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , inner disk structure is important for understanding how the close - in extra - solar planets discovered by radial velocity surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) either formed at , or migrated to their observed orbital radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    currently , only near - ir interferometric observations have sufficient spatial resolution to probe directly the geometry and temperature of hot ( @xmath4 k ) disk regions within @xmath5 au of young stars .",
    "observations of the inner disks of a few of the brightest t tauri stars @xcite and of their more massive counterparts , herbig ae stars @xcite , demonstrated that inner disks around lower - mass stars ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) are larger than inferred by fitting geometrically thin accretion disk models to seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "inclusion of puffed - up inner walls in the models leads to consistent fits to both interferometric and sed data for these objects @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , higher - mass herbig be stars @xcite and the extreme accretor fu ori @xcite are fitted well with simple flat disk models , suggesting that inner disk structure may depend on accretion rates or stellar properties .",
    "a larger sample of resolved inner disks , including lower - mass t tauri stars , is necessary to explore such trends .    here ,",
    "we present 2.2 @xmath1 m keck interferometer observations of the inner disks around four solar - type ( 1 - 2 m@xmath7 ) t tauri stars , potential analogs to our own young sun . in order to model the stellar and circumstellar emission accurately ,",
    "we combine our spatially resolved interferometry data with optical / near - ir seds and high - resolution echelle spectra .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic data are essential for decomposition of the observed 2.2 @xmath1 m flux into stellar and excess components . since t tauri stars are variable at near - ir wavelengths on timescales of several days to months ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , our spectroscopic , photometric , and interferometric data were obtained within several days of one another .",
    "the photometry and spectra also enable determination of various properties of these systems , including stellar masses , ages , temperatures , radii , @xmath8 , binarity , mass accretion rates , magnetospheric truncation radii , and co - rotation radii .    from the 2.2 @xmath1 m interferometry data , we establish inner disk radii and temperatures , and distinguish between flat and puffed - up inner disk models .",
    "in addition , we compare these measured sizes with inferred magnetospheric and co - rotation radii . although our sample is small , the range of stellar and accretion properties allows us to explore how inner disk structure depends on these parameters .",
    "our sample consists of four classical t tauri stars : as 207a , v2508 oph , as 205a , and px vul . as 207a",
    ", the optically - brightest t tauri star in @xmath9 oph , was identified as a young star based on its h@xmath10 emission @xcite , and also as one component of a @xmath11 binary system @xcite .",
    "the t tauri star v2508 oph @xcite is located near the l162 dark cloud .",

    "* ) , identified as the brightest component of a @xmath13 binary system by @xcite .",
    "we assume that as 207a , v2508 oph , and as 205a are all at the approximate distance of the @xmath9 oph cloud , 160 pc @xcite . finally , px vul is a t tauri star in the vul r2 region , at a distance of 420 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the fringe - tracker detects a source in a 5ms integration , setting a limiting @xmath14-band magnitude of @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , sources must be optically bright enough for the adaptive optics ( ao ) systems on each keck aperture . superb seeing ( @xmath16 ) allowed excellent ao performance for our sample . for each target",
    ", we measured squared visibilities ( @xmath17 ) at k - band ( @xmath18 @xmath1 m , @xmath19 @xmath1 m ) . the system visibility ( i.e. , the point source response of the interferometer ) , was measured using observations of unresolved calibrators , weighted by the internal scatter in the calibrator and the temporal and angular proximity to the target source @xcite .",
    "source and calibrator data were corrected for detection biases as described by @xcite and averaged into 5s blocks .",
    "the calibrated @xmath17 for the target sources are the average of the 5s blocks in each integration , with uncertainties given by the quadrature addition of the internal scatter and the uncertainty in the system visibility .",
    "typical uncertainties are @xmath20 .",
    "all calibrators were chosen to be compact ( angular diameters @xmath21 mas ) and close to the target sources ( within @xmath22 ) .",
    "in addition , our calibrators have @xmath14-band magnitudes similar to those of our targets , to minimize potential biases . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the calibrators are brighter than the targets , which may lead to enhanced ao performance ; by measuring the photon counts along both interferometer arms and applying a standard `` ratio correction '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we calibrate out the effects of ao performance on the visibilities . the data for as 207a , v2508 oph , and as 205a were calibrated using hd 142943 and hd 148968 , and data for px vul were calibrated using hd 181383 and hd 182919 .",
    "we obtained dithered imaging observations of our sources at @xmath24,@xmath25 , and @xmath14 on june 4 , 2004 , using the palomar 200-inch adaptive optics system @xcite with the pharo camera @xcite .",
    "after bias correction , background subtraction , and flat - fielding of the images , photometric fluxes were measured with respect to the same calibrators used in our ki observations .",
    "calibrator magnitudes are known from the 2mass catalog , assuming they are non - variable .",
    "the photometric errors are given by the quadrature addition of the rms variations in brightness between source integrations and the uncertainties in the calibrator magnitudes .",
    "since the sources and calibrators were observed at similar airmasses , we apply no atmospheric extinction corrections .",
    "the measured fluxes for these sources are listed in table [ tab : phot ] .    with the high angular resolution afforded by adaptive optics imaging ( @xmath26 at @xmath14-band ) we were able to resolve as 207 and as 205 into binaries , finding parameters ( see table [ tab : binaries ] ) consistent with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "for these systems , we measured photometric fluxes for both the primaries and secondaries ; @xmath23 magnitudes for the primaries are listed in table [ tab : phot ] , and @xmath27 values are given in table [ tab : binaries ] . since the projected binary separations are much larger than the field of view of ki ( 50 mas ) , we obtained interferometric data only for the primaries .",
    "no spatially resolved companions brighter than @xmath28 were detected near v2508 oph or px vul , and we consider these to be single stars hereafter .",
    "we observed our sample through johnson @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32 , and kron @xmath33 and @xmath34 filters on june 8 , 2004 using the robotic palomar 60-inch telescope .",
    "photometric fluxes were measured from bias - corrected , flat - fielded images using well - studied photometric standards @xcite .",
    "we determined extinction corrections and magnitude zero - points using observations of five landolt standards obtained throughout the night .",
    "photometric errors for our target sources are the sum of various uncertainties in quadrature : the rms variation between integrations ( where multiple integrations of a source are available ) , the uncertainties in zero - points and extinction coefficients , and uncertainties in magnitudes of our calibrators .",
    "photometric uncertainties are typically @xmath35 , except at @xmath30-band , where substantial uncertainties in the extinction coefficients lead to large error bars for the measured fluxes .",
    "the seeing - limited resolution of these observations was @xmath36 , and the close binaries in our sample , as 207 and as 205 , are unresolved .",
    "optical photometry for these sources , listed in table [ tab : phot ] , therefore includes contributions from both the primaries and the secondaries .",
    "high dispersion optical spectra of the sample were obtained on 2004 june 11 using the hires spectrograph @xcite on keck i. hires was used with the red collimator , an rg-610 filter , and the d1 decker ( 115 x 140 ) , yielding r@xmath37 34,000 spectra over 6330 - 8750  , with gaps between orders . an internal quartz lamp and a thar lamp were observed with the same setup for flat fielding and dispersion correction .",
    "several dwarf spectral type standards with known radial velocities were also observed to assist in the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the binary as 205 was observed with the slit along the axis of the pair , while as 207 ( an unresolved binary in these observations ) , v2508 oph and px vul were observed with the slit perpendicular to the horizon ( vertical mode ) .",
    "the hires spectra were reduced using the facility `` makee '' reduction script written by tom barlow .",
    "reduction includes bias - correction , flat - fielding , spectral extraction , sky subtraction , wavelength calibration , and heliocentric radial velocity corrections .",
    "this procedure worked well for single stars , but not for the components of as 205 whose spectra overlap . in that case , the component spectra were determined by fitting two gaussians to each one - dimensional cut in the spatial direction of the two - dimensional spectra .",
    "the fwhm of the best fit gaussians were 04 ; the seeing was quite good and the 12 pair is reasonably well resolved .",
    "these extracted component spectra were then assigned the wavelength solution of the combined system as determined by makee .",

    "we determined radial velocities , rotational velocities , spectral types , and continuum excesses for our sample from optical spectra ( table [ tab : sample ] ) , following @xcite .",
    "radial velocities and @xmath46sin@xmath47 values are estimated by fitting a parabola to the peak of the cross - correlation functions , derived using dwarf stars of similar spectral type .",
    "the spectral types and the optical veiling levels at @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50  ( defined as @xmath51 ) are established simultaneously by comparisons with artificially veiled dwarf standards .",
    "for the binary as 205 , spectral types are determined for both components from spatially - resolved spectra . in this discussion , we focus on as 205a , but analysis of as 205b , itself resolved into a spectroscopic binary , is included in appendix [ sec : as205b ] .",
    "the binary as 207 is spatially unresolved in the spectral data , preventing extraction of individual components .",
    "however , the large flux ratio for the as 207 components ( table [ tab : binaries ] ) suggests that the spectral type of the system is dominated by that of as 207a .",
    "as 207a , v2508 oph , and as 205a have mid - k spectral types , while px vul is hotter , with a spectral type of f3 . since the optical photometry does not resolve the components of as 205 and as 207 (  [ sec : optical ] ) , we measure flux ratios from adaptive optics or spectroscopic observations and use the spectral types for the components to determine flux ratios at wavelengths where the pairs are spatially unresolved . for as 205 , the two gaussian fits to echelle spectra (  2.4 ) provide a direct measure of the flux ratios at @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands of 0.16 and 0.24 , respectively .",
    "the independently determined spectral types then provide estimates of flux ratios for the spatially unresolved @xmath52 measurements .",
    "for as 207 , the two components are unresolved in the echelle spectra and we employ a less direct procedure .",
    "we assume that the spatially - resolved j - band measurement (  [ sec : ao ] ) probes the photosphere of each component , and then predict flux ratios at the shorter , spatially unresolved wavelengths using the measured spectral type for as 207a ( k5 ) and an assumed spectral type of m3 for the secondary .",
    "the companion s spectral type is consistent with both the observed j - band flux ratio and the cooler spectral types assigned from near - infrared spectroscopy and photometry for the composite system @xcite .",
    "stellar temperatures are assigned based on measured spectral types assuming a dwarf temperature / spectral type relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extinctions and stellar luminosities are determined by comparing the veiling - corrected @xmath53 fluxes to those expected from kurucz models most similar in temperature , assuming @xmath54 ( appropriate for pre - main sequence stars aged 1 - 10 myr ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "stellar ages range from 0.6 to 6.9 myr ( table [ tab : sample2 ] ) .",
    "while considerable uncertainties in pre - main sequence evolutionary models may lead to large errors in absolute ages , the relative ages are more secure . including adopted uncertainties of 100 k for stellar temperature and 30% for stellar luminosity , as 207a and v2508 oph",
    "appear to be the youngest stars in the sample , while as 205a is somewhat older , and px vul is older still .",
    "we note that the apparent spread in ages may also correspond to different accretion histories for different sources , which could lead to variations in the birthline for pre - main sequence models ; thus , the relative ages should be treated with some caution .",

    "the bolometric correction factor is highly uncertain , and probably introduces uncertainties of a factor of @xmath62 in the computed accretion luminosities .",
    "we also calculate the accretion luminosity from the observed @xmath30-band excess luminosity ( @xmath63 ) following @xcite : @xmath64 although the accretion luminosities calculated using equation [ eq : lacc ] use a smaller bolometric correction than for the first method ( due to the assumed high temperature of the accretion excess ; * ? ? ?",

    "we find that accretion estimates based on @xmath30-band fluxes are typically higher than those computed from @xmath33-band measurements , although the two estimates are consistent to within a factor of 2 .",

    "for example , 30% errors in 2.2 @xmath1 m stellar flux lead to size errors of 25% and 23% for as 207a and v2508 oph , but only 2% and 7% for as 205a and px vul .",

    "extended emission is difficult to constrain , since observations that can resolve faint emission on angular scales smaller than 50 mas are virtually non - existent .",
    "however , previous analysis of the visibilities and seds of more luminous herbig ae / be stars indicates small ( @xmath84 ) contributions from extended emission on @xmath85 scales @xcite . for ki , which has a field of view of only 50 mas",

    ".    near - ir emission may also arise from hot gas in accretion shocks at the stellar photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since these hot gas components are compact compared to emission from the circumstellar dust disk , they would tend to raise the visibilities compared to those predicted by our equation [ eq : decomp ] ; i.e. , lead to smaller inferred disk sizes .",
    "in contrast , for the measured seds hot gas would contribute extra emission , leading to _ larger _ inferred disk sizes .",

    "below , we assume that near - ir emission from extended dust or hot gas is insignificant compared to the stellar and disk emission .",

    "an alternative truncation mechanism is magnetospheric disruption of the disk , which is expected to yield a range of inner disk truncation radii and temperatures depending on accretion rates and stellar magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", it is expected that @xmath127 , since outside of co - rotation , the centrifugal barrier would prevent accretion of material above the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "moreover , the slow rotational velocities of t tauri stars ( compared to expectations for the collapse of rotating clouds ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are often explained by magnetic locking of the stellar rotation to the inner disk , which requires @xmath128 .",

    "the keck / hires spectrum of as 205b ( figure [ fig : as205b ] ;  [ sec : highres ] ) showed it to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary , making as 205 a hierarchical triple .",
    "since the components of as 205b , labeled ba and bb , are of similar brightness , slowly rotating , and reasonably well separated in velocity , their properties can be determined somewhat independently .",
    "we use a technique similar to that described in  [ sec : stellar ] , but tailored to fit the components of a spectroscopic binary .",
    "radial velocities , rotational velocities , spectral types , and continuum excesses for the components of as 205b are determined from the optical spectra .",
    "radial velocities and @xmath8 values are estimated by fitting the two peaks of the cross - correlation function . as 205ba and bb have radial velocities of @xmath135 km s@xmath69 and @xmath136 km",
    "s@xmath69 , respectively . both have projected rotational velocities below our measurement limits ( @xmath137 km s@xmath69 , @xmath138 km s@xmath69 ) ; the larger limit for as 205bb is a consequence of its fainter features .",
    "the flux ratio of the components , their spectral types , and the continuum excess of the system ( defined here as @xmath139 ) are determined simultaneously by comparisons with synthetic spectroscopic binaries , generated by combining dwarf standards at the appropriate velocities .",
    "the best fit is determined by minimizing the root - mean - squared difference between as 205b and the synthetic binary spectra over several temperature - sensitive regions .",
    "the components have spectral types of k7@xmath1401 ( as 205ba ) and m0@xmath1401 ( as 205bb ) , and as 205ba is slightly brighter ( @xmath141_{r } = 1.52\\pm0.12 $ ] , @xmath141_{i } = 1.38\\pm0.11 $ ] ) .",
    "the optical veiling of the system ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) suggests on - going accretion , although it is not possible to determine if this is onto the primary , the secondary or both .",
    "a high accretion rate is also consistent with the strong and broad h@xmath10 emission ( ew@xmath144  ; 10% width = 384 km s@xmath69 ) .",
    "we estimate the visual extinction and luminosity of each component using the relative fluxes of the spectroscopic binary components at @xmath33 and @xmath34 in combination with spectral types , veiling , and the total as 205b fluxes determined in ",
    "[ sec : stellar ] .",
    "we determine visual extinctions of 3.9 mag and 3.4 mag , and luminosities of 0.44 l@xmath7 and 0.26 l@xmath7 for as 205ba and bb , respectively .",
    "comparison of the effective temperatures ( 4000 k , 3800 k ) and luminosities with the @xcite pre - main sequence evolutionary models yields stellar masses of 0.74 m@xmath7 and 0.54 m@xmath7 and ages of 5.1 myr and 5.4 myr for as 205ba and bb , respectively .",
    "given the uncertainties , all three components of the as 205 system appear to be coeval .",
