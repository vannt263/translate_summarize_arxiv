    "in 1982 , richard arnowitt co - authored a fundamental paper on supergravity with ali chamsheddine and pran nath , which discussed how to apply supergravity to particle physics  @xcite using the formulation of applied supergravity in  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of theoretical works in subsequent years that applied supersymmetry to particle physics , used the techniques outlined in these papers .",
    "many proposed experimental tests of supersymmetry were proposed in both colliders and low energy processes  @xcite . the fact that supersymmetry provided a resolution of the hierarchy problem of the standard model added momentum to this research and made it one of the primary areas of activity in beyond the standard model physics .",
    "the particular model under the  microscope \" was the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "when the large hadron collider at cern was being built , search for supersymmetric partners of the sm particles became one of its primary goals .",
    "in the most popular version of mssm , a new symmetry called r - parity ( see below ) is assumed to be an exact symmetry .",
    "this has the implication that the lightest superpartner is absolutely stable and can be identified as the dark matter of the universe .",
    "this additional attractive property of mssm prompted most of the lhc searches for supersymmetry to focus on r - parity conserving modes , which always involve missing energy final states .",
    "so far these experimental efforts have not proved successful in uncovering any evidence for supersymmetry , pushing the mass limits on super - partners to uncomfortably large values .",
    "the search for supersymmetry will of course continue as soon as the 14 tev beam turns on .",
    "the absence of evidence for it in the run i , however , has inspired efforts to go beyond the mssm to include new effects such as r - parity breaking ( rpv ) , extra sm singlet fields , extra gauge symmetries etc .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a brief overview of extensions of mssm that involve r - parity breaking in various theoretical settings and their implications .",
    "its goal is not to provide an exhaustive account of the vast field of rpv models but rather a brief overview of some of salient features of such models .",
    "there already exist many excellent reviews of the subject and they should be consulted for detailed implications as well as references .",
    "application of supersymmetry to particle physics starts with a supersymmetric version of the standard model ( sm ) , where all the fields , both fermionic and bosonic , get  promoted \" to become chiral superfields which have both a bosonic and fermionic parts .",
    "the partners of known sm fermionic fields are called  sfermions \" ( e.g. squarks , sleptons etc . ) . partners of higgs fields",
    "are called  higgsinos \" .",
    "the gauge fields become the vector superfields , again with bosonic components identified with the familiar @xmath0 whereas their fermionic parts being new fields called gauginos .",
    "most discussions of mssm are based on the superpotential @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the matter superfields and @xmath3 are the up and down type higgs superfields . to this one",
    "must add the gauge interaction part to get the full supersymmetric lagrangian . since supersymmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature",
    ", one must also add the supersymmetry breaking terms , which consist of mass terms for superpartners , trilinear terms of type present in the above superpotential but will all terms being the scalar components of the superfields and mass terms for gauginos , all of which must respect the gauge symmetry .",
    "the terms in the superpotential of eq .",
    "( 1 ) are however not the only @xmath4 invariant and supersymmetric terms that could have been written down given the superfields of mssm .",
    "this is where the story of r - parity comes in .",
    "it was pointed out in 1978  @xcite , that in models with the above superpotential  ( eq ( 1 ) ) , one can define an exact symmetry of the lagrangian given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is baryon number , @xmath7 is lepton number and @xmath8 is the spin of the particle .",
    "this symmetry is known as r - parity . under this symmetry ,",
    "all superpartners of sm fields are odd while all the sm fields are even .",
    "r - parity invariance is , of course , of great experimental relevance for collider searches for supersymmetry since it implies that all superpartner fields must be produced in pairs and must decay to states , at least one of which must be an rp - odd particle ( or a superpartner field ) .",
    "also it implies that the lightest superpartner field ( lsp ) must be absolutely stable .",
    "this fact has two cosmological implications : ( i ) it implies that if the lsp is electrically charged , then the theory is cosmologically disfavored  @xcite ; ( ii ) on the other hand if the lsp is electrically neutral , it can play the role of dark matter of the universe , as eluded to above .",
    "these facts are all well known and likely will be discussed in other articles in this volume .",
    "the goal of this article is to discuss theories which depart from the above simple paradigm and involve terms that break r - parity before or after gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "r - parity breaking is a vast topic ( for a review , see  @xcite ) and in this article , no attempt will be made to give comprehensive discussion of all issues and implications of the models .",
    "rather , i give a brief overview of various ways that r - parity breaking emerges , and give examples of some models where r - parity remains a natural symmetry ( i.e. the symmetry is guaranteed by the original gauge symmetry even after its breaking to match phenomenology ) and some implications of these models . in particular , it is noted that in minimal theories that extend mssm to include local @xmath9 symmetry , r - parity breaking is mandatory . to the extent that neutrino masses seem to suggest that indeed physics beyond the standard model must include a broken local @xmath9 symmetry ,",
    "the fact that its supersymmetrization leads to rpv theories , makes a compelling case for theoretically exploring and experimentally testing the idea of r - parity violation .    to start with ,",
    "let us note that there are two classes of models of r - parity breaking(rpv ) : ( i ) spontaneous breaking by giving vevs to neutral superpartners , which in the case of mssm is the superpartner of the neutrino ( or sneutrino )  @xcite or ( ii ) by adding r - parity violating terms in the superpotential  @xcite .",
    "below i present some models and results pertaining to both these lines of thinking .",
    "as we will see below , in case ( i ) , generically , a single vacuum expectation value characterizes all r - parity violating interactions and therefore the theory is quite predictive in rpv sector .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , i discuss explicit r - parity breaking in mssm ; in sec .",
    "3 , i review works on models with global @xmath9 symmetry and in sec . 4 , those with local b - l ; in sec .",
    "5 , i discuss ways to obtain rpv superpotentials and their implications . in sec . 6 ,",
    "some cosmological implications of rpv are discussed ; in sec 7 , status of r - parity violation in grand unified theories are noted .",
    "8 , gives some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we focus on explicit rpv terms in mssm  @xcite , which can be written as : @xmath10 this is a class of most widely studied model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these models have 45 rpv coupling parameters . the last term ( i.e. the bilinear rpv term )",
    "could always be rotated by redefining the the down type higgs @xmath11 which then simply redefined the @xmath12 and @xmath13 couplings .    first point to note",
    "is that if all three i.e. @xmath14 ) are present , exchange of squarks will lead to proton decay with amplitudes proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "present bounds on proton lifetime imposes severe constraints on them e.g. roughly @xmath16 for couplings with first generation indices and slightly less severe for higher ones arising from ckm mixings . to avoid excessively small couplings therefore , it is useful to search for extensions of mssm where only either @xmath17 or @xmath18 is present . in the last couple of years ,",
    "examples of this type have emerged and we give them below .",
    "@xcite and @xmath19 couplings  @xcite from lepton number violating processes such as @xmath20 decay . ]",
    "a question has always remained in the explicit rpv models as to how naturally to guarantee proton stability and yet have rpv interactions so that alternative interpretation of lhc limits on susy can be given .",
    "there are two possibilities :    \\(i ) include baryon parity as an exact symmetry under which all quark superfields change sign and others do not . as a result",
    ", one gets @xmath21 but the other rpv terms remain .",
    "this model does not lead to proton decay or any other form of baryon number violation .",
    "this is similar to spontaneous rpv models .",
    "\\(ii ) look for symmetries that allow the @xmath18 terms but not @xmath17 terms . again in this case , proton decay is suppressed in leading orders .",
    "an example of this kind of model which is motivated by attempts to understand flavor puzzle of sm , is given below .",
    "one class of models where the proton decay problem is automatically avoided are the ones where r - parity is spontaneously broken .",
    "we start with them first .",
    "the basic idea of this class of models is to start with a theory which conserves r - parity in the lagrangian and let the vacuum state break it .",
    "that would mean giving vacuum expectation value to a superpartner field which is r - parity odd .",
    "the relevant fields must of course be color and electrically neutral . in the case of mssm that leaves only fields that carry a non - zero lepton number as the three sneutrinos . in the extended models",
    "there could be more choices .",
    "we give two examples below :      since we do not want to break electric charge , pretty much the three fields of mssm which are candidates for acquiring vevs , are the three superpartners of the neutrinos i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "the first spontaneous rpv model that was written down in ref .",
    "@xcite , used one of these fields and spontaneous r - parity violation was implemented by giving the electron type sneutrino a non - zero vev .",
    "it is clear from the above definition of r - parity that since this field has @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 , it is odd under r - parity and its vev will therefore break r - parity . since @xmath26 carries lepton number but no baryon number , this theory leads to only lepton number violating but baryon number conserving couplings in the resuting lagrangian with many phenomenological consequences . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is clear that @xmath27 vev will mix the lepton with the higgsino .",
    "when the mass terms for the lepton fields are diagonalized , it leads to lepton number violation since the higgsino has no lepton number in the starting lagrangian .",
    "the strength of lepton number violation is dictated by the magnitude of the @xmath27 vev .",
    "the detailed phenomenology of the model was discussed in  @xcite . in 1982 ,",
    "the information available information on the low energy weak interactions was limited and the model was found to be consistent with all data .",
    "this was followed up in several papers  @xcite where vev was assigned to the @xmath28 field so that some of the constraints of the previous model  @xcite were weakened . however",
    "both these types of models were ruled out by subsequent observations .",
    "the main reason is as follows : since vev of a sneutrino breaks global @xmath9 symmetry spontaneously , the model predicts a zero mass goldstone boson , the majoron  @xcite .",
    "the majoron is the field , @xmath29 im@xmath26 and is part of an @xmath30 doublet field . as a result , it couples to the @xmath31 boson together with the re@xmath32 .",
    "so unless the re@xmath26 is heavier than 90 gev , @xmath31 will decay via the @xmath33 mode resulting from spontaneous r - parity breaking .",
    "this mode will contribute like half a neutrino to the invisible width of the @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31-width was measured very precisely at lep and slc and does not have any room for such a large contribution to @xmath31 invisible decay .",
    "thus this class of spontaneous rpv models  @xcite , where @xmath34 field has vev and the real part of the @xmath35 field is also light ( as it happens in simple versions of the model ) , are now ruled out by experiments .      to avoid this conflict with @xmath31 width measurement ,",
    "a new class of spontaneous rpv models were proposed in  @xcite where instead of the left handed sneutrino fields having a vev , the mssm was extended to include a right handed neutrino , @xmath36 and the superpartner of the right handed neutrino field , @xmath37 was given a vev .",
    "the starting superpotential for this model is : @xmath38 the @xmath39 field has zero lepton number and @xmath40 and @xmath8 fields have @xmath41 respectively . in this case , the massless majoron field , corresponding to spontaneous breaking of global lepton number symmetry , is given by linear combination of im@xmath37 and im@xmath8 fields which are both @xmath30 singlet fields and the majoron therefore does not couple to the z - boson .",
    "the z - width constraint therefore does not apply .",
    "we note however that generation @xmath37 vev in this model is not mandatory but is chosen to illustrate the idea .    in both these classes of models ,",
    "r - parity of the basic lagrangian is an assumption as is the vev of the sneutrino field .",
    "below we discuss models where r - parity becomes an automatic symmetry due to local @xmath9 symmetry when the sm gauge group is extended and in a subclass of these models , @xmath37 vev is mandated by other physical considerations .",
    "we discuss examples of these models below .",
    "the introduction of local @xmath9 symmetry imposes interesting constraints on r - parity .",
    "the first interesting point is that unlike r - parity conserving mssm where rpv terms of the superpotential are set to zero by hand , the local @xmath9 symmetry forbids the presence of all rpv terms automatically  @xcite .",
    "this guarantees the stability of neutralino dark matter and provides a more compelling picture of dark matter compared to mssm . however , whether r - parity ultimately remains a good symmetry or not depends on the detailed structure of the model .",
    "the gauge group for these models  @xcite is @xmath42 with all particle assignments given according to their @xmath43 quantum numbers .",
    "the only extra superfields of the model beyond those of mssm are @xmath40 ( three for three generations to cancel gauge anomalies ) .",
    "the higgs superfields of the model are the two mssm doublets @xmath44 .",
    "the superpotential is given by : @xmath45 therefore to break the local @xmath9 symmetry so that the model becomes phenomenologically viable , the right handed sneutrino @xmath46 must acquire a vev .",
    "since this field is @xmath47 odd , it breaks r - parity ; thus r - parity is spontaneously broken . in some sense",
    ", one could call these models the  genuine spontaneous rpv models \" since , r - parity violation is mandatory to reduce the gauge symmetry down to the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the simplest complete model of this type is the model of ref.@xcite , which uses a minimal set of fields and shows that r - parity is dynamically broken by radiative corrections  @xcite by the same mechanism that was used for radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry in minimal supergravity theories of mssm  @xcite .",
    "the massless majoron field which arose in the case of global @xmath9 breaking is now absorbed as the longitudinal mode of the @xmath9 gauge field .",
    "phenomenology of these models , including its lhc signatures , have been studied extensively in  @xcite and are not discussed here .",
    "the spontaneous breaking can also be shown to arise radiatively by extrapolating the @xmath46 mass from the gut scale , which is an interesting feature .",
    "it is also worth noting that a gauged b - l can have a mass growth for the vector boson preserving r parity within a stueckelberg mechanism  @xcite    below the @xmath48 scale , the effective mssm that emerges has the usual rp conserving superpotential together with an rpv term of the form @xmath49 .",
    "this is a bilinear rpv term  @xcite and by rotation of the @xmath50 fields it can be removed and replaced by the rpv superpotential where the couplings of the explicit rpv terms are predicted in terms of quark and lepton yukawa couplings and the ratio @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the familiar @xmath52-term of mssm .",
    "it is also clear that it induces only only terms of type @xmath53 and @xmath54 and thus no baryon number violation .",
    "this is an interesting feature of such models which enhances the appeal of such theories for rpv .",
    "neutrino masses in these models arise from the inverse seesaw  @xcite mechanism and have an interesting  layered \" pattern that includes sterile neutrinos , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a slight extension of the above minimal models enables the r - parity to be an exact symmetry . to do this",
    ", we need to include one pair of additional higgs fields with @xmath55 , called @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the new superpotential for these models is : @xmath58 the ground state of this theory corresponds to @xmath59 as can be seen by minimizing the f- and d - term contributions to the potential .",
    "this breaks @xmath9 by two units and therefore keeps r - parity exact .",
    "it also gives mass to the right handed neutrinos so that seesaw formula ( type i )  @xcite for neutrino masses i.e. @xmath60 emerges .",
    "for @xmath61 and @xmath62 tev , this gives right order of magnitude for the neutrino masses in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "something interesting happens , once the model with local @xmath9 ( subsection b above ) is embedded into its left - right symmetric version and the @xmath63-field is omitted . to explain this ,",
    "let us start with a brief overview of the left - right models .    in the minimal l - r model , the fermions",
    "are assigned to the gauge group @xmath64 as follows : denoting @xmath65 and @xmath66 as the quark and lepton doublets respectively , @xmath67 and @xmath7 are assigned to doublets under the @xmath30 group , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 as the doublets under the @xmath70 group  @xcite .",
    "their @xmath9 quantum numbers can easily be worked out from the definition of the electric charge : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the third components of isospin under @xmath30 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "the higgs sector of the model consists of one or several of the following multiplets : @xmath74 the @xmath75 superfield must be accompnaied by a @xmath76 field to cancel anomalies .",
    "al;so note that the bi - doublet field contains two sm doublets .",
    "in the language of mssm , it contains the @xmath77 of mssm unified in their couplings by parity .",
    "for example , each @xmath78 coupling to quarks leads to both down and up higgs couplings to be equal . as a result to get ckm mixings , we need at least two bi - doublets ib susylr models of this type . the gauge symmetry @xmath79 is broken by the vev @xmath80 to the group @xmath81 of the sm .",
    "there is also an lh counterpart ( @xmath82 ) to @xmath75 which we do not consider here .",
    "there are versions of the model where parity and @xmath70 gauge symmetry scales are decoupled so that the @xmath82 fields become heavy when the discrete parity symmetry is broken . the low energy lagrangian in this case has invariance under the l - r gauge group but not parity .",
    "we will focus on this class of models in this paper , since they seem to be sufficient to illustrate our points regarding rpv .",
    "the vev of the @xmath78 field given by @xmath83 breaks the sm gauge group to @xmath84 .",
    "the superpotential for this model is given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86 stand for generations and @xmath87 for labeling the higgs bi - doublets , and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 being the second pauli matrix ) .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the dirac fermion masses are given by the generic formula @xmath90 for up - type fermions , and for down - type quarks and charged leptons , it is the same formula with @xmath91 and @xmath92 interchanged .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian ( [ eq : yuk ] ) leads to the dirac mass matrix for neutrinos @xmath93 and the majorana mass matrix for the heavy rh neutrinos @xmath94 which go into the equation for calculating the neutrino masses and the heavy - light neutrino mixing .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in this minimal susy left - right seesaw model , if we express the scalar potential , @xmath95 as functions of the vevs of the neutral higgs fields ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 and look for a minimum of @xmath95 along the direction @xmath99 ( i.e. r - parity conserving ) , the minimum occurs at @xmath100 .",
    "we then show that once we include r - parity breaking effect by the vacuum i.e. @xmath101 i.e. along the direction @xmath102 , there appear global minima that break parity i.e. @xmath103 and also that it occurs only below a certain value for @xmath96 and @xmath104 i.e. there is an upper limit on the parity breaking scale .",
    "thus , breaking of r - parity is dynamically induced in the correct vacuum .",
    "no choice of parameters is required for this result .",
    "this is an example of dynamical breaking of r - parity  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this minimal left - right seesaw model , the requirement of gauge symmetry breaking leads to an upper limit on the right handed @xmath105 scale of @xmath106  @xcite where @xmath107 is an average value of the majorana yukawa coupling ( defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : yuk ] ) .",
    "this result led to further investigation to see under what conditions a left - right seesaw model can lead to an r - parity conserving vacuum  @xcite .",
    "this generally involves adding higher dimensional terms to the superpotential or new fields e.g. triplet higgs fields with @xmath108  @xcite with non - zero vevs or for some domain of parameters , simply including one loop radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "there are many attempts in the literature to understand the flavor problem .",
    "one promising direction starts from the realization that in the limit of vanishing yukawas of the standard model , the family ( flavor ) symmetry of the model becomes @xmath109 ^ 5 $ ] .",
    "the hope then is that breaking of this symmetry could provide an understanding of the flavor pattern of fermions .",
    "the question then is whether this is a global or local symmetry .",
    "regardless of this question , one could discuss the implications of such models for rpv as has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the global version will be plagued by the appearance of massless states which will affect many aspects of cosmology .",
    "attempts therefore have been made to pursue these symmetries as local symmetries  @xcite .",
    "this requires the introduction of vector - like sm singlet fermions . once this model is supersymmetrized , it has interesting consequences for r - parity that we discuss below  @xcite .",
    "we focus on supersymmetric versions of the gauged flavor with left - right symmetric electroweak interactions ref .",
    "@xcite from which we borrow the notation .",
    "the largest flavor group for this case is @xmath110 . for the cancellation of anomalies",
    "we introduce vector - like superfields @xmath111 and @xmath112 , analogously to the case of the mssm . the overall anomaly free gauge group is therefore @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents the flavor gauge symmetries respectively in the left- and right - handed quark sector , and @xmath115 the corresponding ones for the lepton sector . the electroweak part of the sm gauge group is embedded into the group @xmath116 that is broken to the sm group @xmath117 by the vev @xmath118 of a set of fields @xmath119 .",
    "the flavor symmetry is broken by a set of flavons @xmath120 and @xmath121 as in the example of the mssm .",
    "the fields of the model and their transformation properties under the group @xmath122 are reported in table [ tab : modelone ] .",
    ".model i matter content and transformation properties .",
    "the mssm fields are the lines with green background , the new matter fields are given in the yellow lines , and the electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking sector is given in the lines with white background . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we thus see that beyond the standard model with with gauged flavor limits the pattern of rpv in such a way that it avoids the proton decay problem and also leads to observable signals in @xmath123 transitions  @xcite via the feynman diagram in fig.1 . in the leading order this diagram leads to @xmath123 processes  @xcite di - proton decay @xmath124 on whose life time there is a lower limit of @xmath125 yrs  @xcite . in conjunction with a @xmath126 or @xmath127 ( @xmath128 standing for bottom flavor ) interactions , such diagrams",
    "can also lead to neutron - anti - neutron oscillation  @xcite .",
    "process induced by @xmath129 rpv terms ]",
    "in this section , we emphasize two cosmological implications of rpv interactions : oner for the origin of matter and second for the nature of dark matter of the universe .",
    "the strengths of rpv interactions are constrained once we assume that matter - anti - matter asymmetry arises above the supersymmetry breaking scale i.e. above the tev scale .",
    "the point is that since the rpv interactions break baryon and lepton number , unless their couplings are very small , those interactions will be in equilibrium and erase any baryon or lepton number asymmetry introduced in the earlier epochs .",
    "the typical requirement is that the rate for @xmath130 or @xmath131 interactions must be slower than the expansion rate of the universe i.e. @xmath132 this gives typically that @xmath133  @xcite and implies that the rpv couplings are typically less than @xmath134 in their strength , if they are not to erase any pre - existing baryon or lepton asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it is interesting that the rpv predictions of the gauged flavor model in table ii are consistent with these bounds . of course",
    ", it could be that baryon or lepton asymmetry is generated below 10 tev scale and if we assume that all superpartner masses are above 10 tev , then such constraints do not apply .",
    "furthermore , it has also been speculated that rpv itself may be a source of the cosmological matter - anti - matter asymmetry which arises in the tev scale  @xcite via the decay of gravitino using rpv modes .",
    "the other possibility is that spontaneous rpv scale is in the tev range so that above that scale , r - parity becomes an exact symmetry and provides a way to avoid these constraints .",
    "as eluded to above , in the presence of r - parity conservation , the lightest super - partner is stable and can be assumed to be the dark matter ( dm ) of the universe .",
    "the conventional choice for dm is the neutralino , which is a majorana fermion and is a linear combination of the wino , bino and the two neutral higgsinos .",
    "however , once r - parity breaking is included in the lagrangian , neutralino becomes unstable and can not anymore play the role of dark matter .",
    "however , supergravity theories can then provide another particle which can be the dark matter i.e. heavy gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton . in the presence of rpv interactions ,",
    "the gravitino is unstable and can decay .",
    "however , since its presence is connected to gravity , its decay strength is suppressed by the gravitational coupling i.e. it coupling to matter is roughly given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is related to the strength of r - parity breaking  @xcite .",
    "this gives its lifetime as @xmath137 . for @xmath138 , @xmath139 can be much longer than the age of the universe . often in actual uv complete models",
    "this can be even longer .",
    "thus gravitino can play the role of a decaying dark matter  @xcite .",
    "while true nature of dark matter to date remains a mystery , there are lepton signals in various experiments which have been interpreted in terms of an unstable gravitino dark matter  @xcite . thus in an ironic sense",
    ", it is not r - parity conservation but rather r - parity breaking which may be relevant to dark matter issues if these signals and others accumulate over time .",
    "in this section , we discuss the status of r - parity in supersymmetric grand unified theories such as su(5 ) and so(10 ) .",
    "we briefly recall that in the susy @xmath140 model , the matter multiplets belong to * 10 * and @xmath141 representations .",
    "it is then clear that one can construct renormalizable interactions involving them e.g. @xmath142 . since the matter content of @xmath143 and @xmath144",
    ", it follows that @xmath145 leads to all three rpv terms of mssm i.e. @xmath146 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 . for some implications of these terms ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat different in the so(10 ) model , which contains local @xmath9 as a sub - symmetry .",
    "therefore as in the left - right case discussed above , prior to symmetry breaking , r - parity is an exact symmetry .",
    "however , since the original @xmath147 symmetry must be broken down to the standard model , whether r - parity is broken in the low energy theory or not depends on how the original gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "for instance , depending on whether @xmath147 is broken down to su(5 ) by ( i ) * 16 * -dimensional higgs field or ( ii ) by * 126 * field determines whether the low energy theory ( or su(5 ) in this case ) is rpv type ( in case ( i ) ) or rpc type ( in case ( ii ) )  @xcite .",
    "both these classes of models have been discussed in the literature and their various phenomenological implications studied .",
    "these two cases exactly parallel the susy left - right model where @xmath9 is broken by a doublet @xmath148 or @xmath149 higgs field .    to illustrate",
    "how rpv terms arise in models with @xmath150 fields , we repeat the point noted above that in so(10 ) models , matter fields belong to also @xmath151 representations . in the higgs sector , in addition to @xmath152 fields , there are fields belonging to * 10 * -dim . reps ( denoted by @xmath153 ) and which are needed to break the @xmath4 symmetry and fields belonging to * 54 * -dim .",
    "( @xmath8 ) and * 45 * -dim ( @xmath154 ) . in this case , it is clear if no other symmetries are imposed on the theory , it will allow couplings of the form @xmath155 as well as other higher dimensional terms e.g. @xmath156 that will break r - parity after symmetry breaking .",
    "r - parity violation is an integral part of supersymmetry and its existence is mandatory in the simplest supersymmetric theories that contain local @xmath9 .",
    "regardless of whether it is explicit or spontaneous , the phenomenon of r - parity violation has many facets to it and touches on such diverse areas of particle physics as low energy rare processes  @xcite , cosmological baryon asymmetry , lhc signals  @xcite , as well as nature of dark matter .",
    "its signals could throw light even on questions relating to the origin of fermion flavor .",
    "it is hoped that this brief overview provides sufficient sense of the excitement and subtleties associated with this line of thinking and will stimulate further progress in this area .",
