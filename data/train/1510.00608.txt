    "open quantum systems have been an active area of research for decades , but only recently have measurements been able to probe the dynamical effects of a coupled environment in detail@xcite .",
    "the environment has historically been thought to lead to deleterious decoherence of the open system , but it is now accepted that the role of the environment can be much more subtle than this .",
    "in particular , the importance of structured environments in the dynamics and coherence of open quantum systems is now beginning to be recognised .",
    "for example , a series of recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have provided strong evidence that strongly coupled discrete molecular vibrations play a significant role in the speed , efficiency , and quantum coherence of energy transfer in photosynthetic and other molecular systems . in a different context",
    ", the high degree of control and precision possible in artificial nanosystems has enabled experimental measurement and engineering of noise spectral densities in condensed matter systems .",
    "studies on micromechanical resonators have revealed a strongly sub - ohmic spectral density ( sd)@xcite ; in another series of experiments , a superconducting flux qubit was used to probe the sd of a microwave transmission line , which could be tuned between ohmic and lorentzian forms using partial reflectors @xcite .    to mathematically model an open quantum system exactly one must fully capture the dynamics of the environment , and this is usually an impossible task : its hilbert space is vast . necessarily",
    "the environment must be treated using various approximations .",
    "one common description employs the markov approximation , meaning that future behaviour depends only on the current state with no memory of preceding interaction@xcite .",
    "markovian environments are generally straightforward to simulate since the dissipative system dynamics are characterised by a set of constant decay rates , which are found from the easily - obtained sd function .",
    "when system - environment correlations decay more slowly the approximation becomes invalid and non - markovian approaches are needed .",
    "there exists a spectrum of techniques for dealing with non - markovianity to varying degrees including master equations@xcite , quasi - adiabatic path integrals@xcite , quantum monte carlo techniques@xcite and hierarchy equations of motion@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will introduce non - markovianity straightforwardly by including part of the ` environment ' in the open system , that is our open system will consist of both the two - level system ( tls ) whose dynamics we want to model , and a single oscillator mode ( sm ) .",
    "the rest of the ( bosonic ) bath will be assumed to be weakly coupled to the open system and to be markovian .",
    "thus we are able to accurately study a structured environment consisting of a continuous background of modes with a strongly coupled single mode at one particular frequency .",
    "this framework maps to a host of physical situations : for example , a multi - site chromophore array in a protein bath typical of photosynthesis , where local protein vibrational modes interact strongly with excitons@xcite , or superconducting qubits coupled to nanomechanical oscillators or microwaves in resonators  @xcite .",
    "we will present our work in the context of a two - site energy transfer system , or dimer , in the two - state subspace of single exciton levels .",
    "a single mode representation of certain strong features of a structured environmental coupling has been studied previously  @xcite , and symmetries have been exploited to reduce the complexity of the resulting system description@xcite .",
    "however , the particular configuration of the tls - sm - bath system investigated here is not represented in these earlier studies , in which the sm either couples to , or is not distinguished from , the bath .",
    "a similar model incorporating a single common mode was used to demonstrate enhanced coherence in the excitonic dynamics of an asymmetric dimer with individual markovian baths for each dimer site@xcite .",

    "without the single mode , an initial excitation on one site of the effective tls oscillates in time between the two sites ; the amplitude of this oscillation is gradually damped by the interaction with the environment .",
    "[ fig : ohmic3d ] and  [ fig : super3d ] show that the inclusion of the single mode complicates the dynamics considerably .",
    "however , the main features can be understood using an analytical approximation for the tls - sm system in the absence of the bath .",
    "the adiabatic approximation of irish _ _ et al.__@xcite provides a physically intuitive basis for the tls - sm system in the case , as here , where the energy splitting of the tls ( here @xmath85  thz ) is much smaller than the frequency of the sm ( here @xmath86  thz ) . in this parameter regime",
    "the system may be approximated by two harmonic potential wells , each associated with one site of the tls .",
    "the effect of the interaction between the sm and the tls is to displace each harmonic well in position space .",
    "to lowest order in the tls energy , the eigenstates of the system are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 corresponds to excitation of site @xmath48 and @xmath89 denotes a number state of the displaced well associated with site @xmath48 .",
    "specifically , in terms of the original sm basis states @xmath90 the displaced bases are given by @xmath91 \\ket{n}$ ] and @xmath92 \\ket{n}$ ] .",
    "the approximate energies are given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a laguerre polynomial .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyg ] , the energy spectrum breaks into a series of well - spaced doublets , where each doublet corresponds to a different value of @xmath95 .    .",
    "the energy levels take the form of a series of closely spaced doublets . ]    within this approximation , it is readily seen that an initial excitation on site @xmath48 , with the sm in a number state in the displaced basis @xmath89 , will undergo rabi - like oscillations between the two sites .",
    "the frequency of this oscillation is determined by the doublet splitting , @xmath96 . from this formula",
    "it is evident that one effect of increasing the coupling @xmath81 is a renormalisation of the oscillation frequency to smaller values , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : ohmic3d ]  and  [ fig : super3d ] .",
    "moreover , the renormalised frequency depends on the number state of the sm .",
    "hence a distribution of different @xmath95 values in the initial state of the sm will lead to multiple oscillation frequencies in the dynamics of the tls population .    for the sm frequency and temperature values",
    "we consider , only two doublets contribute significantly .",
    "a thermal state of a 100  thz mode at @xmath97  k is in the ground state with probability @xmath98 ; the first excited state has probability @xmath99 and all other states have probability of less than 1% .",
    "therefore the dynamics in figs .",
    "[ fig : ohmic3d ] and  [ fig : super3d ] are dominated by just two oscillation frequencies .",
    "[ fig : splitting ] shows how these two frequencies change with the coupling @xmath81 .",
    "both frequencies display a strong renormalisation effect , shifting to smaller values as @xmath81 increases ; however , the frequency corresponding to @xmath100 changes more rapidly with @xmath81 .",
    "in addition to the frequency shift seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohmic3d ] , several other aspects of the dynamics illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : super3d ] can be explained by the frequency renormalisation effect .",
    "[ fig : super3d ] shows an apparently counterintuitive decrease in the damping of the oscillations as @xmath81 is increased .",
    "this arises from the combination of frequency renormalisation and the peaked form of the super - ohmic spectral densities .",
    "the spectral densities have been chosen to have their peaks at the bare oscillation frequency @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath81 increases , the oscillation frequencies shift to lower values , moving away from the maximum of the sd .",
    "[ fig : samplesd ] illustrates this effect for the frequencies corresponding to the @xmath102 and @xmath100 doublets .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the renormalised frequencies for a range of @xmath81 values , showing the points at which the sd is sampled .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath103 at lower frequencies means that the system undergoes less damping .",
    "in particular , the @xmath100 oscillation frequency decreases more rapidly with @xmath81 and thus is damped much less than the @xmath102 mode .",
    "+    in fig .",
    "[ fig : super3d](a)-(c ) the oscillations that persist out to long times for large @xmath81 correspond to the @xmath100 component of the initial state , as the dominant @xmath102 component is damped away fairly rapidly .",
    "as the sd becomes more strongly peaked , this effect becomes more pronounced , which is consistent with the trend visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : super3d ] .",
    "the oscillations along the @xmath81-axis arise from the @xmath81-dependent shift in frequency of the @xmath100 component .",
    "by contrast , the dominant oscillation visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : super3d](d ) at large @xmath81 values corresponds to the @xmath102 renormalised frequency . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplesd ] , the lorentzian sd at this frequency is much smaller than the ohmic or super - ohmic sds and hence the @xmath102 oscillation decays much more slowly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : longdyn ] we show long - time , nanosecond dynamics for the @xmath104 super - ohmic sd and a very strong coupling of @xmath105  thz .",
    "there is a very long - lived oscillatory component to the dynamics that shows no signs of decay even after @xmath106    though we have checked numerically that it does eventually reach a steady state population of 0.5 .",
    "this feature is also visible , but not so obvious , in fig .",
    "[ fig : super3d](a)-(c ) through the seemingly fixed population , away from the equilibrium population of @xmath107 , for @xmath108  .",
    "an initial transient regime exists over a period of tens of and can just be discerned in fig .",
    "[ fig : longdyn ] . during this transient stage other oscillatory frequencies present in the dynamics are damped away leaving only the single slow feature associated with the @xmath100 doublet which , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting ] , is close to degeneracy at @xmath105  thz .",
    "the amplitude of this persistent slow oscillation corresponds to the probability of the @xmath100 state in the initial thermal distribution of the sm , here about 7% .    .",
    "the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation correspond to the @xmath100 state of the sm .",
    "strong frequency renormalisation due to the large value of @xmath81 means that the bath has an extremely weak damping effect , allowing coherent oscillations to persist out to very long times despite the influence of the environment . ]",
    "thz . in this case",
    "increasing @xmath81 pushes the oscillation frequencies of the system toward the peak of the sd rather than away from it , resulting in greater damping . ]",
    "this interpretation of our results predicts that the effect of increasing @xmath81 should be reversed if the peak of the sd lies at a frequency below the bare @xmath101 splitting of the tls .",
    "then as @xmath81 increases the renormalised oscillation frequencies will be pushed toward the peak of the sd rather than away from it , resulting in increased damping . in fig .",
    "[ fig : push ] we present dynamics for such a scenario , where the peak of the lorentzian sd is chosen to be @xmath109  , shown as the shifted lorentzian in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplesd ] . note that the choice to keep the renormalisation energy @xmath70 constant means that the peak height is lower than the lorentzian centred at @xmath110 . for values of @xmath111  thz",
    ", the renormalised @xmath102 frequency corresponds to a point where @xmath112 is increasing rapidly ; the corresponding increase in damping is dramatically evident in the dynamics .",
    "we have found that a single strongly coupled bosonic mode can have a profound effect on the coherent dynamics of an open tls .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , our work shows that strong coupling to a vibrational mode can actually enhance quantum coherent features in site - to - site dynamics .",
    "moreover we have shown that this effect happens for a mode that is far off - resonant with the tls s natural oscillation frequency and that it can occur at room temperature .",
    "we have also found that certain spectral densities exhibit this coherence enhancement to differing degrees ; this is a consequence of their peakedness , and so how quickly the frequencies at which the sd is sampled are moved away from the peak by the sm coupling .",
    "our results show that off - resonant modes contribute to the dynamics when treated exactly , providing justification for efforts extending theoretical tools to accommodate such treatments . if an open tls interacts with an environment with a sd like those investigated here we have shown that its coherence properties are altered .",
    "sd modification has recently been demonstrated through reservoir engineering@xcite , and we speculate that using this technology with a strongly coupled vibrational mode could lead to a tool for maintaining or quickly damping oscillatory dynamics .",
    "future work will need to generalise our approach to explore asymmetric dimers strongly coupled to more than one mode .",
    "nonetheless , our findings provide a tantalising look at the possibilities for novel quantum effects in complex open quantum systems .",
