    "the celebrated riemann hypothesis asserts that all the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function @xmath4 are on the so - called critical line , re@xmath5 .",
    "we will refer to zeros of @xmath4 on the critical line as riemann zeros , and restrict attention to those in the upper half plane  those in the lower half plane are obtained by complex conjugation .",
    "there is an intriguing relationship between the riemann zeros and random matrix theory .",
    "it originates from the viewpoint that the riemann zeros , for distances far up the critical line , are best considered in a statistical sense rather than as a deterministic sequence .",
    "the first step in a statistical analysis is to scale the sequence so that locally the density of the zeros far up the critical line is unity .",
    "this is straightforward from knowledge of the fact that at position @xmath6 along the critical line , and with @xmath7 , the density ( @xmath8 say ) is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "280 ) @xmath9 montgomery @xcite made a study of the density of the scaled zeros about a fixed zero , with the latter averaged over some window of size @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "this quantity , referred to as the _ two - point correlation function _ ,",
    "is probed by computing the average value of a test function @xmath12 , with @xmath13 corresponding to the fixed zero .",
    "subject to the technical assumption that the class of test function used has fourier transform supported on @xmath14 , the limiting two - point correlation function was proved to be equal to @xmath15 where the superscript ` r ' denotes that this quantity pertains to the riemann zeros data . on the other hand ,",
    "let @xmath16 be an @xmath2 random matrix with standard complex gaussian entries , and form the hermitian matrix @xmath17  the set of such matrices specifies the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "after normalisation so that the eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum have unit density , the @xmath18 form of the two - point correlation function is precisely ( [ s ] ) ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.1.1 ) .",
    "this coincidence , first observed by dyson ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * pg .  159 ) ) , is in keeping with and extends the so - called _ hilbert  plya conjecture _ @xcite that the riemann zeros correspond to the eigenvalues of some unbounded self - adjoint operator .",
    "considerations in quantum chaos ( see e.g.  @xcite ) give evidence that generically the large eigenvalues of such operators have local statistics coinciding with the eigenvalues of large random hermitian matrices .",
    "the latter must be constrained to have real entries should there be a time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus this line of reasoning suggests that asymptotically the riemann zeros have the same local statistical properties as the large eigenvalues of a chaotic quantum system without time reversal symmetry .",
    "this assertion is essentially a statement of what now is called the montgomery ",
    "odlyzko law or the gue conjecture ; see also @xcite the reviews @xcite , and the thesis @xcite .    at an analytic level ,",
    "further evidence for the validity of the law was given by rudnick and sarnak @xcite , who extended montgomery s result to the general @xmath19-point correlation function by obtaining the explicit functional form @xmath20_{j , l=1,\\dots , k},\\ ] ] again subject to a constraint on the fourier transform of the class of test functions involved ; see the recent work @xcite for some refinements . by use of a conjecture of hardy and littlewood relating to the pair correlation of prime numbers , and",
    "also at the expense of introducing some non - rigorous working , bogomolny and keating @xcite removed this constraint .",
    "the @xmath19-point correlation ( [ s1 ] ) is precisely that for the eigenvalues of large hermitian random matrices in the bulk scaling limit ; see again  ( * ? ? ?",
    "at a numerical level , odlyzko has made high precision computations of the @xmath21-th riemann zero and over 70 million of its neighbours @xcite , and ( later ) of the @xmath22-nd zero and one billion of its neighbours @xcite .",
    "( the zeros on the critical line are conventionally numbered in the order of their distance from the real axis , with the first zero at @xmath23 ( * ? ? ? * a058303 ) . )",
    "this data exhibits consistency with random matrix theory for statistical quantities such as the pair correlation function outside the range known rigorously from the work of montgomery , the distribution of the spacing between neighbouring zeros , the variance of the fluctuation of the number density in an interval etc . ; for a popular account of this line of research see @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the extraordinary distance along the critical line achieved in odlyzko s calculations , it turns out that finite size corrections to the limiting behaviour occur on the scale of the logarithm of the distance as suggested by ( [ 1a ] ) , and thus are of significance in the interpretation of the data from the viewpoint of the random matrix predictions . in addressing the question of the functional form of the finite size corrections from the viewpoint of random matrix theory ,",
    "keating and snaith @xcite ( see also the review @xcite and the later work @xcite ) were led to a totally unexpected conclusion : the correct model for this purpose is not complex random hermitian matrices , but rather @xmath2 random unitary matrices chosen with haar measure , and @xmath24 related to @xmath25 so as to be consistent with ( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "random unitary matrices with haar measure result , for example , by applying the gram - schmidt orthonormalisation procedure to a matrix of standard complex gaussians .",
    "the statistical quantities considered in @xcite relate to the value distribution of the logarithm of the riemann zeta function on the critical line , which for random matrices corresponds to the value distribution of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "coram and diaconis @xcite subsequently used the random unitary matrix model to predict the functional form of the covariance between the number of eigenvalues in overlapping intervals of equal size .",
    "following up on @xcite , where odlyko studies the difference between the spacing distribution for the riemann zeros and the corresponding limiting random matrix distribution and writes :  clearly there is structure in this difference graph , and the challenge is to understand where it comes from \" , bogomolny et al .",
    "@xcite considered finite size corrections to the spacing distribution for random unitary matrices . while previous studies in random matrix theory gave analytic results relating to the value distribution of the characteristic polynomial @xcite , there is no existing literature on the analytic calculations of the leading finite size correction to the spacing distribution for random unitary matrices .",
    "here we are referring to the point - wise value of the expected probability density function ; there is an existing literature relating to the decay as a function of @xmath24 of the kolmogorov distance between the empirical cumulative spacing distribution and its expected large @xmath24 form @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the corrections were computed using an extrapolation procedure of a determinant expression valid for finite @xmath24 .",
    "a primary objective of the present paper is to provide an analytic characterisation of the leading finite size correction to the spacing distribution .",
    "variants of the nearest neighbour spacing distribution also provide relevant statistical quantities .",
    "for example , one could consider spacing distributions between zeros @xmath19 apart ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or the distribution of the closest of the left and right neighbours @xcite . another variant is to consider spacing distributions resulting from first thinning the data set by the process of deleting each member independently with probability @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as first considered in random matrix theory by bohigas and pato @xcite . in both cases",
    "the finite size correction to the large @xmath24 form of the corresponding quantity for the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices can be computed analytically .",
    "this is of concrete consequence as we are fortunate enough to have had a.  odlyzko provide us with a data set extending that reported in @xcite .",
    "specifically , this data set begins with zero number @xmath28 and this occurs at the point @xmath29 in the complex @xmath30-plane with @xmath25 equal to @xmath31 the data set contains a list of slightly more than @xmath0 of each of the subsequent riemann zeros .",
    "thus we are able to compare the analytic forms against the finite corrections exhibited by the riemann zeros , uninhibited by sampling error .",
    "we begin in section [ s2 ] by considering the two - point correlation .",
    "bogomolny and keating @xcite have derived an explicit formula for this quantity in the case of the riemann zeros , in the regime that @xmath25 is large but finite .",
    "subsequently bogomolny et al .",
    "@xcite showed how the result of @xcite could be expanded for large @xmath25 to obtain the correction term to the random matrix result ( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "moreover , upon ( partial ) resummation , the correction term was found to be identical in its functional form to the correction term of the scaled large @xmath24 expansion of the two - point correlation for the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices chosen with haar measure . after reviewing this result",
    ", we compare the empirical form of the two - point correlation as computed from odlykzko s data set , and for the data set thinned with parameter @xmath32 , against the theoretical prediction . very good agreement is found for distances up to approximately one and a half times the average spacing between zeros , after which systematic deviation is observed .",
    "higher order correlations for random unitary matrices are fully determined by the same function  see ( [ 2.0 ] ) below  as determines the two - point correlation .",
    "assuming the same is true for the correlations of the riemann zeros , it follows that the coincidence between the correction term to the leading large @xmath25 form of the two - point correlation for the riemann zeros and the correction term to the leading large @xmath24 form of the two - point correlation for the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices persists to all higher order correlations .",
    "while higher order correlations can not be measured empirically from the riemann zeros data , this hypothesis becomes predictive as the coincidence must carry over to any distribution function which can be written in terms of the correlation functions , for example the nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xcite .",
    "in section 3 we make two main contributions to the study of this theme .",
    "one is to test the hypothesis upon thinning of the data set .",
    "the other is to provide an analytic determination of the correction term in the random matrix case , using certain painlev transcendents .",
    "the correction term to the nearest neighbour spacing is oscillatory , and becomes more so as the thinning parameter @xmath33 is decreased from 1 . in sections",
    "[ s : space ] and [ s : num ] we discuss this effect in the context of the large distance form of the painlev transcendents .",
    "correlation functions are fundamental to the theoretical description of general point processes . for definiteness , and in keeping with the setting of the riemann zeros",
    ", we will specify that the point process is defined on a line . starting with @xmath34 as the density at point @xmath35",
    ", the @xmath19-point correlations @xmath36 can be defined inductively by the requirement that the ratio @xmath37 corresponds to the density at the point @xmath38 , given that there are particles ( or zeros , or eigenvalues etc . ) at locations @xmath39 .",
    "suppose the particle density @xmath40 is identically constant so that the point process is translationally invariant , and furthermore take the constant to be unity .",
    "we then have that the two - point correlation @xmath41 is just the density at @xmath42 given that there is a particle at @xmath43 .",
    "as such , in this circumstance , @xmath44 can be empirically determined from a single data set . to see this note that due to translational invariance , @xmath45 depends only on @xmath30 , allowing @xmath43 to be averaged over to generate the necessary data for a statistical determination .    for the eigenvalues @xmath46 of @xmath2 unitary matrices chosen with haar measure ,",
    "the @xmath19-point correlation is given by the @xmath47 determinant ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath48_{i , j=1,\\dots , k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51  referred to as the _ correlation kernel _ ",
    "is given by @xmath52 in particular the two - point correlation is given by @xmath53 which one sees tends to ( [ s ] ) in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the leading correction term to this asymptotic form .",
    "as reported in @xcite , an elementary calculation gives @xmath54    the situation with the riemann zeros is more complicated . for a start , since the riemann zeros are a deterministic sequence , a statistical characterisation only results after an averaging over a suitable interval of zeros about the point @xmath35 of interest along the critical line , and with the use of a test function . and , as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is only for a restricted class of test functions  those whose fourier transform have support on @xmath14  that rigorous analysis of the correlations has been possible .",
    "even then the theorems obtained are statements about the leading asymptotic form only .",
    "the discussion in the introduction mentioned that a non - rigorous , but predictive analysis based on an analogy with a chaotic quantum system , together with the use of a conjecture of hardy and littlewood for the pair correlation function of the primes , allows for further progress @xcite .",
    "one consequence is that ( [ s ] ) can be derived as the two - point correlation function without the assumption of a restricted class of test functions .",
    "again , this is a statement about the limiting asymptotic form . for present purposes ,",
    "the most relevant feature of the results of @xcite is that they allow for the determination of the leading correction term to the limiting asymptotic form .",
    "the necessary working is given in @xcite , where it was shown that at position @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , along the critical line , with the local density normalised to unity , and with @xmath8 given by the leading term in ( [ 1a ] ) the smoothed two - point correlation has the large @xmath25 expansion @xmath55 the constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of convergent expressions involving primes , which when evaluated give the numerical values @xmath58 and @xmath59 . moreover , with @xmath60 it was observed that ( [ rsc ] ) can be rewritten @xmath61 comparison with ( [ sc ] ) shows that the correction terms agree subject to relating the matrix size @xmath24 and the distance along the critical line @xmath25 according to @xcite @xmath62 provided too that the scaled distance @xmath30 is further rescaled @xmath63    in the theory of point processes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) a thinning operation , whereby each member is deleted independently with probability @xmath26 , is used to create a family of point processes from a single parent process . the effect on the corresponding @xmath19-point correlation",
    "@xmath64 is very simple  the @xmath33 dependence scales to give @xmath65 thus introducing the variables @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) one sees that @xmath68 the variables @xmath69 correspond to a rescaling so that the density of the original point process remains unchanged , assuming translational invariance .      to determine the two - point correlation @xmath70 empirically from odlyzko s data set we must first rescale the data by so that the rescaled local mean density is unity ; we then delete each zero with probability @xmath71 .",
    "next we sample this sequence by empirically computing the zero density of the sub - system formed by each zero in turn as the left boundary , and a fixed number ( say 50 ) of its neighbours .",

    "the resulting graphical forms are identical to the leading order random matrix prediction .",
    "following @xcite our main point of interest is in the functional form that results after subtracting the leading random matrix prediction from the empirical two - point function for odlyzko s data set , @xmath74 the theory of @xcite , as reproduced in above , predicts that this quantity is , to leading order in @xmath75 , itself of random matrix origin . as a test of its validity , figure [ f:2ptcomp ] displays a comparison of the empirical data and the theoretical predictions .",
    "very good agreement is found for distances up to approximately one and a half times the average spacing between zeros , and furthermore the period of the oscillations are well matched for all distances in the display . on the other hand , as the distances increase , there is a systematic discrepancy at a quantitative level .",
    "anticipation of the expanded form not being in agreement for increasing distances comes when one graphically compares the corrections in and  recalling , in particular , that theoretically and agree to leading order .",
    "thus one finds that their mismatch increases with increasing distance .",
