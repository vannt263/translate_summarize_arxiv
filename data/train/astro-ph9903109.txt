    "the diffuse cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) was discovered in 1962 predating the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by several years .",
    "the spectral characteristics and the spatial distribution of the cxb have been measured by many x - ray missions , but its origin is still not yet fully understood .",
    "the 360  kev spectrum is well described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature , kt , of 40  kev ( @xcite ) . between 1 and 10  kev",
    "this shape can be approximated by a power - law with a photon index , @xmath8 , of 1.4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of distortion of the cmb expected from a truely diffuse hot intergalactic medium supports the idea that the cxb above 1  kev is dominated by emission from an unresolved distribution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent results from the deepest ( flux limit @xmath910@xmath10  erg  @xmath4",
    "s@xmath5 ) x - ray survey so far performed , suggest that the fraction due to discrete sources in the energy range 0.52.0  kev is 7080% ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent results from a  survey support such an origin ( @xcite ) .    below @xmath91.5  kev",
    "the cxb shows additional spectral and spatial complexity .",
    "spatially , there is a large degree of structure visible , with several features evident in all - sky maps ( e.g , @xcite ; snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) . at @xmath90.25  kev",
    "there is a clear anti - correlation with both galactic latitude ( the cxb being significantly weaker at the galactic equator ) , and with the amount of hi in the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low - energy cxb spectrum deviates from the simple power - law observed @xmath111  kev .",
    "line emission from ovii and cv was observed using solid - state detectors by @xcite and @xcite , strongly supporting the view that emission from an optically thin thermal plasma contributes significantly at low - energies .",
    "later studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that to fit rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) spectra of the soft cxb two thermal components are required , in addition to the power - law .",
    "the spatial dependence of the low - energy cxb is similar to that expected if extragalactic , isotropic emission is absorbed by the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , the observed degree of modulation of the cxb and the lack of a significant spectral modulation ( @xcite ) are incompatible with such a model .",
    "thus , a significant part of the soft cxb emission is likely to be of local origin .",
    "models which rely on a significantly clumpy ism ( @xcite ) have been proposed to explain the lower than expected modulation from an isotropic ism .",
    "diffuse emission maps and deeper pointed observations of shadowing by cold gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have revealed a consistent yet complex origin for the diffuse background . a soft ( @xmath90.1  kev ) component originates from a combination of the local hot bubble and a galactic halo , but with the latter modulated spatially by local enhancements from bright clouds . in the 0.75  kev energy range the galactic emission is dominated by a bulge component and other enhancements associated with relatively nearby supernova remnants and wind - blown bubbles ,",
    "together with a galactic plane enhancement of which some component is undoubtedly due to a superposition of individual sources .",
    "there may also be a contribution from inter - cluster gas of the local group ( see hasinger 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "deep pointed observations performed with imaging detectors onboard rosat and asca have provided a good opportunity to study the 0.110  kev cxb , typically yielding , as discussed above , a spectrum compatible with a power - law and two thermal components .",
    "however , the spectral parameters derived from the two missions are not always consistent . in particular , the power - law slopes are not always in agreement ( see the discussion in chen et al .",
    "1997 ) and even in the well calibrated 12  kev overlapping energy range , estimates of the cxb flux vary by 1520% .",

    "the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; 0.110  kev ; @xcite ) is an imaging gas scintillation proportional counter on - board the italian - dutch  x - ray astronomy mission ( @xcite ) . in comparison with the 0.12.5  kev pspc , the lecs offers energy resolution a factor @xmath92.4 better and an extended high - energy response , overlapping with the asca solid state imaging spectrometer ( sis ; 0.510  kev ) .",
    "the lecs has comparable energy resolution to the sis at @xmath90.5  kev .",
    "this combination of moderate energy resolution and broad energy coverage provides a unique capability for studying the low - energy cxb .",
    "in particular , the determination of the normalization and break energy of the cxb spectrum around 1  kev has proved problematical .",
    "the lecs spans this energy range exactly and so provides the potential for accurately measuring the relative contributions of the galactic and extragalactic components .",
    "the lecs has a circular field of view ( fov ) of 37@xmath12 diameter ( @xcite ) and an effective area of @xmath910  @xmath13 at 0.28 kev and @xmath940  @xmath13 at 2  kev . in the central 8  radius of the fov , the mean non x - ray background ( nxb )",

    "all uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath30 ) . when determining spectral uncertainties all the other variable parameters were allowed to vary freely .",
    "the photoelectric absorption coefficients of @xcite , together with the cosmic abundances of @xcite were used ( which are supposed to be representative of the composition of the proto - solar nebula ) .",

    "the cxb is modeled as a uniform diffuse emission , by means of 100 point sources randomly distributed within a radius of 12 .",
    "this radius is larger than that of the extraction region ( 8) to allow for photons from sources located within the region that are spread outside of the region by the finite detector resolution , and for events originating outside the extraction region which are spread inside .",
    "in addition to the above effects , single reflected x - rays from within 120  can be detected in the fov ( @xcite ) . in order to estimate the magnitude of this effect , 0.16  kev flux ratios between a pointed crab nebula observation ( @xcite ) and two pointings where the crab nebula was located just outside the lecs fov , with offset angles of 45  and 60 , were calculated .",
    "the spectrum of the singly reflected x - rays is consistent with that observed on - axis , but with a much reduced intensity .",
    "an exponential function was used to characterize the dependence of the flux ratios on offset angle . assuming that the x - ray sky is uniform within 120 , integration of this function reveals that singly scattered x - rays contribute @xmath311% of the flux within an 8  extraction radius . since this is well within the uncertainty in cxb normalization ,",

    "the discrepancy between the lecs and pspc based analyses of the cxb spectrum is of the same nature , with the pspc analysis deriving a cool component with a large emission measure , not visible in the lecs .",
    "this points to a possible systematic effect in the low - energy calibration of the pspc .",

    "kev is very similar to the temperature of the cooler component obtained in the two temperature fit .",
    "thus , the effect of introducing the broken power - law in the fit is to eliminate the 0.7  kev thermal component .",
    "additional evidence for the presence of multiple components to the cxb comes from shadowing experiments using nearby ( @xmath960  pc ) clouds such as lvc  88@xmath9236@xmath232 and mbm  12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the distant component dominates the off - cloud low - energy ( @xmath310.3  kev ) spectrum . in observations towards clouds located within the local hot bubble ,",
    "the distant component suffers extra absorption , as does only part of the nearby component .",
    "it is difficult to directly compare the lecs and pspc spectral results .",
    "both instruments indicate that emission from a plasma with a temperature of @xmath90.15  kev dominates the low - energy cxb spectrum . in the case of the pspc",
    "this is the distant , absorbed , component ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the lecs indicates that this is the nearby component and the more distant ( absorbed ) component is either a 0.7  kev thermal plasma , or the low - energy tail of a broken power - law .",
    "if this latter model is correct , then there is no need to invoke a second thermal component .",
    "the broken power - law almost certainly results from distant agn .",
    "the differences between on- and off - cloud spectra may result primarily from emission measure and absorption effects within the local hot bubble , as well as from additional absorption of the distant component .",
    "we have used a set of deep observations with the  lecs to study the high galactic latitude cxb spectrum .",
    "we show that the spectrum is consistent with both a power - law plus two thermal components model ( as currently accepted for the rosat pspc plus asca sis background determinations ) , and with a broken power - law plus single thermal component model .    while the power - law parameters are in good agreement with the asca sis measurements , the temperatures of the thermal components are significantly different from those obtained with the pspc . in particular , the `` super - soft '' thermal component seen by the pspc",
    "is not evident in the lecs spectrum .",
