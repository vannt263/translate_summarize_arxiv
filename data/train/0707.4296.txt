    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is the effective field theory of the strong interactions at low energies ( for an introduction see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it relies on a perturbative expansion in terms of small parameters @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes a quantity like the pion mass or external momenta that are small relative to the scale @xmath3 , which for chpt is expected to be of the size @xmath4 .",
    "one of the essential ingredients of chpt is a consistent power counting , which assigns a chiral order @xmath5 to each feynman diagram for the process in question and which predicts that diagrams of higher orders are suppressed . assuming the coefficients of the perturbative expansion to be of natural size one would expect contributions at order @xmath6 to be suppressed by a factor @xmath1 compared to contributions at order @xmath5 . for @xmath2 of the order of the pion mass and @xmath7",
    ", this corresponds to a correction of about @xmath8 . in the mesonic sector of chpt",
    "this rough estimate seems accurate , however , the situation is less clear for the baryonic sector .",
    "while for example the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass shows a good convergence behavior , the nucleon axial coupling @xmath9 receives large contributions from higher - order terms @xcite .",
    "further examples include the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which only describe the data for very low values of momentum transfer .",
    "for some of these quantities higher - order contributions clearly play an important role . the description of the nucleon form factors can be improved by the inclusion of vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom , which corresponds to the resummation of higher - order contributions @xcite .",
    "the convergence properties of baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) are also of great importance for lattice qcd . due to numerical costs ,",
    "present lattice calculations still require pion masses larger than the physical one , and results obtained on the lattice have to be extrapolated to the physical point .",
    "chpt as an expansion in the pion mass is the appropriate tool to perform such extrapolations , which again poses the question for which values of small parameters the chpt expansion gives reliable predictions .",
    "there are several renormalization schemes for manifestly lorentz - invariant bchpt at the one - loop level that result in a consistent power counting while preserving all relevant symmetries @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used of these is the infrared ( ir ) regularization of ref .",
    "all these renormalization schemes have in common that there is a relation between the chiral order and the loop expansion , so that the investigation of higher chiral orders requires the evaluation of multi - loop diagrams . in ref .",
    "@xcite a reformulated version of the ir regularization has been introduced that is also applicable to multi - loop diagrams @xcite .",

    "it results in diagrams obeying the standard power counting ( see sec .  [",

    "infrared regularization is based on dimensional regularization and the analytic properties of loop integrals , and in its original formulation is applicable to one - loop integrals containing pion and nucleon propagators in the one - nucleon sector of chpt . in ref .",
    "@xcite a different formulation of infrared regularization was presented which reproduces the results of the original formulation up to arbitrary order .",
    "the advantage of the new formulation is that it can also be applied to multi - loop diagrams and diagrams containing additional degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "since ir regularization can , in fact , be viewed as a renormalization scheme we also refer to it as infrared renormalization .",
    "we briefly describe those features of the renormalization of one - loop integrals which are important for the renormalization of two - loop integrals .",

    "infrared renormalization consists of splitting the integral into an infrared singular part @xmath15 and an infrared regular part @xmath16 , @xmath17 or for short @xmath18",
    "the advantage of splitting the original integral into two parts is that the infrared singular part @xmath15 satisfies the power counting , while @xmath16 contains terms that violate the power counting .",
