    "in recent years index type invariants of virtual knots have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers in virtual knot theory . roughly speaking , this kind of virtual knot invariants",
    "are usually defined by counting the indices ( also called the weights ) of real crossing points in a virtual knot diagram .",
    "the first invariant of this type was introduced by henrich in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are no degree one vassiliev invariants in classical knot theory . in @xcite henrich constructed a sequence of vassiliev invariants of degree one for virtual knots .",
    "by using the idea of parity discussed in @xcite , the author defined a polynomial invariant of virtual knots , say the odd writhe polynomial @xcite .",
    "we choose this terminology because it generalizes the odd writhe , a numerical invariant of virtual knots which was first proposed by l. kauffman in @xcite .",
    "later , these polynomial invariants were generalized independently by y. h. i m , s. kim and d. s. lee @xcite , lena c. folwaczny and l. kauffman @xcite , cheng and gao @xcite , s. satoh and k. taniguchi @xcite .",
    "the key point of these invariants is one can assign an index to each real crossing point such that the signed sum of crossings with the same index is preserved under the generalized reidemeister moves .",
    "several variations and applications of these invariants can be found in @xcite .    an interesting feature of index type invariants is that one can use them to distinguish some virtual knot from its mirror image or inverse .",
    "however there also exists one obvious drawback : if a real crossing has zero index then it has no contribution to the invariant .",
    "recently this shortcoming was improved by myeong - ju jeong in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", jeong introduced the zero polynomial which focused on the real crossings with zero index .",
    "some examples of virtual knots that have trivial writhe polynomial but nontrivial zero polynomial were given .",
    "inspired by jeong s work , in this paper we will describe a new virtual knot invariant which generalizes several polynomial invariants mentioned above . for each oriented virtual knot diagram @xmath0",
    "we will associate it with a transcendental function @xmath1 , which has the form @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is a polynomial in @xmath4 . in section 4",
    "it will be found that @xmath1 is invariant under generalized reidemeister moves , hence it is a virtual knot invariant .",
    "we will discuss the relations between @xmath1 and other index type polynomial invariants mentioned above .",
    "finally , some interesting properties of @xmath1 will be systematically studied in section 5 .",
    "in this section we take a brief review of virtual knot theory and the definitions of several polynomial invariants of virtual knots .",
    "virtual knot theory was first introduced by l. kauffman in @xcite . roughly speaking , classical knot theory studies the embeddings of circles in 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 up to ambient isotopy .",
    "evidently the ambient space @xmath5 can be replaced by @xmath6 . as an generalization of the classical knot theory , virtual knot theory studies the embeddings of circles in @xmath7 up to ambient isotopy , homeomorphisms of @xmath8 and the addition or substraction of empty handles , here @xmath8 denotes the closed orientable surface with genus @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    "we say two embeddings are _ stably equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other one by some operations above . when @xmath10 virtual knot theory recovers the classical knot theory @xcite",
    ".    another useful way to understand virtual knots is to regard them as the realizations of gauss diagrams . given a classical knot diagram , one can find a unique gauss diagram of it .",
    "however for a given gauss diagram sometimes one can not realize it as a classical knot diagram . in order to settle this problem",
    ", one needs to add some virtual crossings on the knot diagram , although these virtual crossings are not indicated on the given gauss diagram . since the way of adding virtual crossings is not unique , besides of the original reidemeister moves we need to add some virtual reidemeister moves to remove the arbitrariness @xcite .",
    "see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "+    formally speaking , a virtual knot diagram can be obtained from a classical knot diagram by replacing some real crossings with virtual crossings .",
    "usually a virtual crossing is represented by a small circle placed around the crossing point .",
    "two virtual knot diagrams are _ equivalent _ if they can be connected by a finite sequence of generalized reidemeister moves .",
    "_ virtual knots _ can be defined as the equivalence classes of virtual knot diagrams . for a given virtual knot diagram @xmath0 ,",
    "consider the one point compactification of the plane where the diagram locates in , then one gets a 2-sphere of the diagram .",
    "let us attach a 1-handle to a virtual crossing and regard this virtual crossing as an overpass locally .",
    "after interpreting all virtual crossings like this and thickening the surface , we will obtain an embedding of @xmath11 in @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of virtual crossing points in @xmath0 .",
    "an important fact is these two interpretations of virtual knots coincides .",
    "@xcite two virtual knot diagrams are equivalent if and only if their corresponding surface embeddings are stably equivalent .",
    "since one motivation of introducing virtual knots is to realize arbitrary gauss diagram , sometimes it is more convenient to study the corresponding gauss diagram than to study the virtual knot diagram .",
    "let us give a short review of the definition of the gauss diagram .",
    "let @xmath0 be a virtual knot diagram , the _ gauss diagram _ of @xmath0 , written @xmath14 , is an oriented ( counterclockwise ) circle where the preimages of each real crossing are indicated .",
    "for the two preimages of a real crossing we add a chord connecting them , which is directed from the overcrossing to the undercrossing .",
    "finally each chord is associated with a sign according to the writhe of the corresponding real crossing .",
    "one simple example is given in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "we remark that virtual reidemeister moves @xmath15 have no effect on the gauss diagram .",
    "therefore as an advantage , when we study virtual knots from the viewpoint of gauss diagrams we only need to consider the classical reidemeister moves @xmath16 .",
    "+    in order to classify virtual knots , one needs to introduce some virtual knot invariants .",
    "some classical knot invariants can be extended directly to virtual knots , such as the jones polynomial and the knot quandle .",
    "later these invariants were generalized using the  virtual structure \" of virtual knots . for jones polynomial , based on kauffman s",
    "approach to it , after smoothing all real crossings one can assign a weight to each circle .",
    "the state - sum gives a generalization of jones polynomial for virtual knots .",
    "this were independently finished by y. miyazawa @xcite and h. dye , l. kauffman @xcite , now known as the miyazawa polynomial and the arrow polynomial . on the other hand , the idea of quandle was generalized to some complicated algebraic structure , such as the biquandle @xcite and virtual biquandle @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on these developments .",
    "now we recall the definition of the writhe polynomial introduced in @xcite .",
    "later we will show how to obtain other index type virtual knot invariants from this polynomial invariant .",
    "let @xmath0 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath14 the corresponding gauss diagram .",
    "since there is a bijection between the real crossings of @xmath0 and the chords of @xmath14 , we will use the same letter to refer a real crossing point and the corresponding chord . choose a chord @xmath17 in @xmath14 ,",
    "now let us assign an index to it , which will play an important role in the definition of the writhe polynomial .",
    "let @xmath18 @xmath19 denotes the number of positive ( negative ) chords crossing @xmath17 from left to right , let @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the number of positive ( negative ) chords crossing @xmath17 from right to left ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define the _ index _ of @xmath17 as    ind@xmath22 .",
    "we mention some similar indices appeared in the literature . in @xcite henrich",
    "defined an _ intersection index _ for each chord , which equals to the absolute value of the index here . in @xcite dye introduced a _ parity mapping _ from the chords of a gauss diagram to @xmath23 , which is exactly the inverse of the index used here .",
    "+    here we list some useful properties of ind@xmath24 , which can be easily verified .    1 .   if @xmath17 is isolated , i.e. no other chord has intersection with @xmath17 , then ind@xmath25 .",
    "2 .   the two crossings appeared in @xmath26 have the same index .",
    "the indices of the three crossings appeared in @xmath27 are invariant under @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 preserves the indices of chords that do not appear in @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "5 .   if @xmath0 contains no virtual crossings , then every crossing of @xmath0 has index zero .",
    "ind@xmath24 is invariant under switching some other real crossings .    due to the properties above",
    ", one can define a numerical invariant of virtual knots as below    @xmath30 @xmath31 ,    where @xmath32 denotes the writhe of @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the set of real crossings of @xmath0 .",
    "note that    @xmath35 @xmath31 ,    where @xmath36 denotes the writhe of @xmath0 .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath37 can be generalized by counting chords with a fixed index . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we write it in the form of a polynomial .",
    "we define the _ writhe polynomial _",
    "@xmath38 to be    @xmath39 .    note that @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", we remark that this definition is slightly different from that given in @xcite , where the polynomial is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "one can easily deduce that @xmath38 is a virtual knot invariant from the properties listed above .    before discovering the indices of chords , it was first observed by l. kauffman @xcite that    @xmath42 ,    which is named the _ odd writhe _ , is a virtual knot invariant .",
    "later this numerical invariant was generalized to the _ odd writhe polynomial _ , which equals to    @xmath43 .",
    "again the definition we give here is also a bit different from the one we gave in @xcite . besides of the writhe polynomial",
    ", the odd writhe polynomial was independently generalized by several groups .",
    "we list the connections between them and the writhe polynomial below .    1 .",
    "the _ parity writhe polynomial _",
    "@xmath44 introduced in @xcite can be described as + @xmath45 .",
    "+ note that replacing the variable @xmath46 with @xmath47 will not weaken the invariant . in this case , it coincides with @xmath48 .",
    "the _ affine index polynomial _",
    "@xmath49 defined in @xcite satisfies + @xmath50 .",
    "+ it is worth mentioning that in @xcite the algebraic structure behind the affine index polynomial was discussed .",
    "it was proved that this kind of index polynomial is essential the unique one derived from an affine linear flat biquandle with coefficients in a commutative ring without zero divisors .",
    "the _ @xmath51th parity writhe _",
    "@xmath52 @xcite is equal to the coefficient of @xmath53 in @xmath38 .    before ending this section we will give an interesting application of using writhe polynomial to detect the non - classicality of virtual knots .",
    "a long - standing open problem in knot theory is whether there exists a nontrivial knot with trivial jones polynomial .",
    "however in virtual knot theory , it is well - known that there exist infinitely many nontrivial virtual knots with trivial jones polynomial .",
    "more precisely , we have the following result .",
    "@xcite let @xmath0 be a nontrivial classical knot , then there is a corresponding nontrivial virtual knot @xmath54 with trivial jones polynomial .",
    "we give a sketch of the proof , see @xcite for more details .",
    "choose a diagram of @xmath0 , let us still use @xmath0 to denote it .",
    "we can find a set of crossings such that after switching all these crossings one will obtain a trivial knot . now for each crossing we take a local replacement ( virtualization ) , see figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "denote the new virtual knot diagram by @xmath54 . note that switching a crossing and virtualizing a crossing have the same effect on the jones polynomial",
    ", it follows that the jones polynomial of @xmath54 is trivial .",
    "however @xmath54 has the same involutory quandle ( also called _ kei _ ) as @xmath0 , which is nontrivial since @xmath0 is nontrivial .",
    "thus , @xmath54 is a nontrivial virtual knot with unit jones polynomial .",
    "+    now we can ask the following two questions .    1 .",
    "whether every nontrivial virtual knot that has trivial jones polynomial can be obtained by virtualization ?",
    "is @xmath54 non - classical ?",
    "if both the answers are yes , then we can conclude that jones polynomial detects the unknot .",
    "for this reason , it was suggested by l. kauffman @xcite to characterize which virtualization can be detected by index type invariants .",
    "here we give a partial answer to this question .",
    "note that this result is in fact a special case of the main theorem in @xcite , which is obtained from an analysis of the knot group .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive ( or negative ) classical knot diagram with unknotting number 1 .",
    "then the corresponding virtual knot @xmath54 is non - classical .    without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath0 is positive . choose a crossing @xmath17 such that switching @xmath17 will unknot @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the gauss diagram @xmath14 .",
    "first notice that @xmath17 can not be an isolated chord in @xmath14 , otherwise @xmath17 is a nugatory crossing and switching @xmath17 preserves @xmath0 . after taking virtualization on @xmath17",
    ", we obtain the gauss diagram @xmath55 , which can be derived from @xmath14 by changing the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a classical knot diagram , it follows that ind@xmath25 in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath56 @xmath57 denotes the number of positive chords crossing @xmath17 from left to right , then there are also @xmath56 positive chords crossing @xmath17 from right to left .",
    "now it is an easy exercise to check that @xmath58 , which is nontrivial .",
    "in this section we give the definition of @xmath1 . the main idea of",
    "the construction is to replace the integer ind@xmath24 in @xmath38 by a polynomial @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath17 a real crossing of it .",
    "denote the chords crossing @xmath17 from left to right and the chords crossing @xmath17 from right to left by @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "let @xmath62 denotes the canonical quotient map from @xmath23 to @xmath63 .",
    "now we define the _ index function _ @xmath59 as below    @xmath64 .    more precisely , if ind@xmath25 , in this case @xmath65 , therefore    @xmath66 .    if ind@xmath67 , then @xmath62 sends every integer into zero , hence    @xmath68 .    in general",

    ", we define a refined version for each of them by letting    @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "now we define the function @xmath1 as    @xmath72    we remark that according to the definition of the index function , it is easy to see that @xmath73 .",
    "hence @xmath74 in fact takes values in @xmath69/(s^{|g_{c_i}(1)|}-1)$ ] , which guarantees the definition above is well - defined .",
    "@xmath1 is a virtual knot invariant .    here",
    "we make some remarks on this invariant .",
    "first , in fact it is not essential to use two variables @xmath75 and @xmath4 .",
    "one can easily find that replacing @xmath4 with @xmath75 will not weaken this invariant .",
    "however it is more convenient to regard it as a generalization of some other polynomial invariants if we use @xmath1 rather than @xmath76 .",
    "for example , we have    @xmath77 , thus @xmath78 .",
    "on the other hand , myeong - ju jeong introduced the zero polynomial in @xcite , which was defined by    @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the zero polynomial can be used to detect the non - classicality of some virtual knots that have trivial writhe polynomials . according to the definition above one",
    "can easily deduce that    @xmath81 .",
    "together with the discussion in section 2 , we see that @xmath1 indeed generalises all the polynomial invariants mentioned in section 1 .",
    "another important thing we want to point out is , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are mutually independent .",
    "let us make a bit more explanation about this .",
    "at the beginning of this story , we have two numerical invariants of virtual knots ,    @xmath30 and @xmath84 .",
    "obviously they are mutually the inverse of each other .",
    "after the first generalization , we have two polynomial invariants ,    @xmath39 and @xmath85 .",
    "we can regard the first part as the contributions from the chords with nontrivial indices , and the second part contains the contributions from the chords with index zero .",
    "however , the second part is preserved hence it can be derived from the first part . after the second generalization , now we have two transcendental function invariants of virtual knots ,    @xmath70 and @xmath86 .",
    "later we will give some examples to show that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are mutually independent , i.e. neither can be derived directly from the other one .",
    "since    @xmath87 ,    @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be viewed as two different generalizations of our original numerical invariant @xmath37 .",
    "now we give one example to explain how to calculate @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider the virtual knot @xmath0 , the gauss diagram @xmath14 is depicted in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "first we write down the index of each chord    @xmath88 .",
    "next we list the index function of each chord    @xmath89 .",
    "it follows that    @xmath90 .",
    "we remark that in this example the writhe polynomial and zero polynomial are both trivial .    ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] +    , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the second example concerns the three virtual knots described in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "direct calculation shows that    & w_k_1(t , s)=t+t^-1 , q_k_1(t , s)=2 , + & w_k_2(t , s)=t+t^-1 , q_k_2(t , s)=-t^1-s^-1-t^s^-1 - 1 + 4 , + & w_k_3(t , s)=3t^-1-t^-3s , q_k_3(t , s)=2 .",
    "note that    @xmath91 ,    but    @xmath92 .",
    "this implies that in general @xmath82 and @xmath83 are mutually independent , as we claimed before .",
    "theorem 2.3 tells us that writhe polynomial can be used to detect the non - classicality of the virtualization of some classical knots .",
    "however there exists some classical knot whose virtualization has the trivial writhe polynomial .",
    "the third example was suggested by l. kauffman in @xcite .",
    "the classical knot @xmath0 illustrated in figure [ figure12 ] has unknotting number 3 .",
    "for example , switching crossings @xmath93 yields the trivial knot .",
    "straightforward calculation shows that @xmath94 but @xmath95 , which means @xmath54 is non - classical and hence nontrivial .",
    "in this section we give the proof of theorem 3.1 . before doing this , we need a simple lemma .",
    "let @xmath96 be the three crossings of the virtual knot diagram locally described on the left side of figure [ figure7 ] . then ind@xmath97-ind@xmath98+ind@xmath25 .    according to the connecting ways outside of the local diagram ,",
    "there are two possibilities of the gauss diagram of @xmath0 , say @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see figure [ figure7 ] ) .",

    "it follows directly that    ind@xmath103 , ind@xmath104 , ind@xmath105 ,    which implies that ind@xmath97-ind@xmath98+ind@xmath25 .",
    "the proof for @xmath100 is analogous .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +     +    now we give the proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "it suffices to check that @xmath1 is invariant under all reidemeister moves illustrated in figure [ figure8 ] @xcite .",
    "the only chord involved in @xmath106 is isolated .",
    "therefore it has index zero and the indices of other chords are invariant .",
    "consequently the index function of the isolated chord is zero , and the index functions of other chords are invariant under @xmath106 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath1 is preserved under @xmath106 .",
    "similarly one can prove that @xmath107 also preserves @xmath1 .    for @xmath108",
    ", first we notice that the two chords involved have the same index but different writhes .",
    "secondly , if a chord intersects one of them then it also has nonempty intersection with the other one . for these reasons ,",
    "the two chords involved in @xmath108 have the same index functions but different writhes .",
    "it follows that the contributions from these two chords to @xmath1 will cancel out . on the other hand",
    ", these two chords will not affect the index function of any other chord , which implies that the contribution from any chord which is not involved in @xmath108 is invariant under @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1 is invariant under @xmath108 .",
    "now let us consider the third reidemeister move @xmath109 . as we mentioned in lemma 4.1 , there exist two possibilities for the gauss diagram of the whole knot diagram .",
    "we only consider the one corresponding to @xmath99 , the proof for @xmath100 is quite similar .",
    "the variation of the gauss diagram @xmath99 under @xmath109 is depicted in figure [ figure9 ] .",

    "for example , let us consider the virtual knot @xmath0 described in figure [ figure11 ] .",
    "direct calculation shows that @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the writhe polynomial tells us that @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast we have @xmath144 , which implies @xmath145 .",
    "since the gauss diagram in figure [ figure11 ] has only 4 chords , we conclude that @xmath146 .",

    "is not well - defined for virtual knots .",
    "for example , the connected sum of two trivial knots maybe nontrivial @xcite . similar to other index type invariants of virtual knots , @xmath1 is additive under a connected sum .",
    "this proposition reveals a shortcoming of @xmath1 .",
    "if a nontrivial virtual knots is a connected sum of two trivial knots , then we can not detect it via calculating the @xmath1 of it .",
    "for example , the kishino knot depicted in figure [ figure10 ] has trivial @xmath1 .",
    "however it is well known that the kishino knot is nontrivial ( in fact even the corresponding flat virtual knot of it is nontrivial ) , which can be detected by , for example , the arrow polynomial @xcite .",
    "we remark that the kishino knot also provides a counterexample to the first question we listed in the end of section 2 , since the involutory quandle of kishino knot is trivial .",
    "further , if each crossing of @xmath0 has index zero , proposition 5.1 tells us that @xmath116 .",
    "the kishino knot is a special case of this . for writhe",
    "polynomial , if one chord has index zero then it has no contribution to the writhe polynomial . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the contribution comes from index zero chord may not be zero .",
    "however @xmath1 is powerless to distinguish a virtual knot from the unknot if each chord of it has index zero .",
    "it is a challenging question to deal with this kind of knots by introducing some extended index invariants .",
    "the three loop isotopy invariant @xcite defined by assigning a weight to a pair of non - intersecting chords may offer some hints to this problem .      finally , let us take a moment to discuss the degree of the invariant we introduced in the present paper . in virtual knot theory , there are mainly two kinds of finite - type invariants .",

    "finite - type invariant of degree @xmath155 _ , if for any virtual knot diagram @xmath0 with @xmath156 singular crossings we have      here @xmath158 runs over all @xmath159-tuples of zeros and ones , @xmath160 denotes the number of ones in @xmath158 and @xmath161 is obtained from @xmath0 by replacing the @xmath162-th singular crossing with a positive ( negative ) crossing if the @xmath162-th position of @xmath158 is zero ( one ) .",
    "the minimal @xmath51 is said to be the _ degree _ of @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath164 denote the two real crossings obtained from the singular crossings in @xmath161 @xmath165 .",
    "first we assume that the chord corresponding to @xmath166 has no intersection with the chord corresponding to @xmath167 .",
    "it is not difficult to observe that @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and the index of any other chord in @xmath161 @xmath165 is equivalent .",
    "it follows that for any real crossing @xmath17 in @xmath0 , the corresponding chords in @xmath161 @xmath165 have the same index function .",
    "therefore we only need to consider the contributions from @xmath164 to @xmath170 , which equals          roughly speaking , the reason why @xmath1 is a finite - type invariant of degree one is that @xmath1 is a weighted sum of each chord in the gauss diagram . if one wants to define a finite - type invariant of higher degree , a sensible idea is to associate a weight to each combinatorial structure of several chords , then take the sum over all subgraphs with this structure in the gauss diagram .",
