    "quantum computation has reached a stage wherein concepts and theory are properly understood while its implementation has not yet surpassed the proof - of - principle level .",
    "the difficulties lie in the state preparation and coherent control of a multitude of two - level systems carrying basic units of quantum information known as _",
    "qubits_. in particular , decoherence due to the leak of information to the environment is a problem .",
    "even so , quantum computation promises unprecedented computational power and the possibility to tackle hitherto unsolvable computational tasks .",
    "this is done by simultaneously processing a multitude of numbers encoded in large superpositions of the corresponding states of quantum systems .",
    "there are several quantum algorithms that have been experimentally realised .",
    "for instance , the deutsch @xcite and deutsch - jozsa @xcite algorithms have been implemented in nuclear - magnetic - resonance systems @xcite , qed cavities @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , light shifts@xcite , superconducting quantum processors @xcite , nitrogen - vacancy defect center @xcite and quantum optical systems @xcite . however , due to the aforementioned problems , the maximum number of qubits used in such implementations has not yet exceeded a few .",
    "for example , the greatest number of qubits used for the deutsch - jozsa algorithm was four @xcite .",
    "thus there has not yet been a computational problem solved on a quantum computer which was inaccessible for classical computers ( turing machines ) .",
    "here we propose to the best of our knowledge the first scalable implementation of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "a salient feature of our proposal is the use of the spatial degree of freedom of classical light fields , allowing to efficiently encode an unlimited number of qubits .",
    "after the deutsch algorithm @xcite , this is the second scheme we present of quantum computation with classical light and the first one that can outperform any touring machine .",
    "the deutsch - jozsa algorithm aims to distinguish between binary functions @xmath0 that are constant , @xmath1 or @xmath2 for all arguments @xmath3 , and balanced functions @xmath4 which assume for @xmath5 of their arguments the value @xmath6 and for the other @xmath5 of arguments the value 1 .",
    "the problem becomes intractable on turing machines if the number @xmath7 is very large , the reason lies in the need to inquire up to @xmath8 functional values from an oracle ( or databank ) . for example , let the arguments of the function be stored in an input register of 200 bits and run over the full possible range from @xmath6 to @xmath9 .",
    "if every query for a functional value would just take a pico second then evaluating @xmath8 values would require up to @xmath10 s , a large multiple of the age of the universe .",
    "a quantum computer can access and process all the functional values at the same time based on the superposition principle and deterministically yield the right result using interference between of the processed states representing the functional values .",
    "the present implementation scheme uses a version of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite which works only with a single register with @xmath11 qubits as explained in the following .",
    "initially each of @xmath12 qubits in the input register prepared in state @xmath13 , is processed by a hadamard transformation , @xmath14 , yielding a superposition of states , which corresponds to @xmath15 arguments @xmath3 : @xmath16 here @xmath17 are the binary digits representing the number @xmath3 .",
    "thereafter the value @xmath6 ( or @xmath18 ) of @xmath19 is encoded as relative phase factors @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) of the input state @xmath22 : @xmath23 because the transformation @xmath24 is linear it imprints the relative phases carrying the information about @xmath19 for all @xmath3-values in the superposition @xmath25 at the same time . a second hadamard transformation of the @xmath12 qubits @xmath26 yields the result of the computation as an interference effect .",
    "the term @xmath27 denotes the bitwise inner product of @xmath3 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the function is constant , the second hadamard transformation reverses the first one and propagates the system back into its initial state @xmath29 .",
    "this can be interpreted as constructive interference of the equal phase factors forming the probability amplitude of state @xmath29 , cp .",
    "right - hand side of ( [ eq : outputquantum ] ) . on the other hand , a balanced function results in the same number of positive ( @xmath20 ) and negative phase factors ( @xmath30 ) which destructively",
    "interfere to a zero probability amplitude for the state @xmath29 . whether the function is constant or balanced",
    "can thus be determined by measuring if @xmath29 is populated or a state in its orthogonal complement .",
    "states in @xmath12 steps .",
    "it resembles the quantum walk on a graph with two edges at each vertex ( a binary tree ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    the central transformation ( [ eq : transformation ] ) , which encodes all functional values as binary phases for each argument @xmath3 into the register , has an immediate optical analog  the imprint of position - dependent phases on the electric field on a transversal plane using a phase mask . a corresponding optical implementation of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite realised the phase imprint by means of a spatial light modulator ( slm ) which acts at a transversal plane on plane - wave laser light .",
    "the subsequent hadamard transformation ( [ eq : outputquantum ] ) is realised by means of the fourier - transform properties of a thin lens ( see [ app : fourier ] ) .",
    "however , such a straight - forward encoding is based on the unary representation of each number @xmath3 corresponding to a position on the transversal plane , i.e. , the phase shifts are encoded on the slm argument by argument .",
    "this procedure requires therefore as many steps to encode functional values in form of phase shifts as there are arguments @xmath3 .",
    "hence the function can not be written efficiently into the register and the solution fails , if the number of arguments is large .",
    "there are several ways to model quantum computation , for instance , the quantum circuit model and measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "although binary tree designs have been previously reported @xcite , here we propose a novel binary decision tree design as a new paradigm to model quantum algorithms which can be helpful to provide an efficient classical optics picture of such algorithms ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : diagef][fig : diagefcnot ] ) .",
    "the method we present here combines the efficient creation of the superposition of all arguments @xmath31 with the encoding of the functional values in the form of phase factors .",
    "it is based on the optical approach of daniela dragoman @xcite to prepare a superposition of @xmath15 states @xmath22 efficiently , i.e. , in @xmath12 steps using a binary decomposition of the number @xmath3 .",
    "our approach modifies dragoman s idea in order to implement the deutsch - jozsa algorithm by means of path qubits and a ring resonator .",
    "the principle of the method is sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : diagef ] . in each step of the preparation corresponding to a round trip in the ring cavity ,",
    "one additional path qubit is generated by splitting each of the present light beams , i.e. , doubling the number of beams . in the first step ,",
    "a single path qubit is created @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the left ( right ) part of the beam ( cp .",
    "[ fig : diagef ] ) . in the second step ,",
    "each of the beams is split again : @xmath34 we denote by @xmath35 the part of the light beam that propagates in direction @xmath36 and @xmath37 after the first and second step , respectively . in @xmath12 steps the state thus changes according to @xmath38 this procedure generates @xmath15 localised light fields , represented by the state @xmath39 , in only @xmath12 steps , i.e. , efficiently .",
    "moreover , our ring cavity setup achieves this with a constant small number of optical devices .",
    "transformation ( [ inputtrafo ] ) thus yields the input state for the central transformation ( [ eq : transformation ] ) of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm above . instead of encoding the information about the function @xmath4 separately , cp .",
    "transformation ( [ eq : transformation ] ) , we combine it with the efficient preparation of @xmath12 qubits ( [ inputtrafo ] ) : @xmath40 a subsequent fourier transform by means of a thin lens interferes the electric fields in the focal point ( see [ app : fourier ] ) resulting in zero intensity for balanced functions and a finite intensity for unbalanced ones , including constant functions .",
    "the intensity is a measure of how biased the function is , but this is not relevant for the deutsch - jozsa problem .",
    "it is in principle possible to realise @xmath41 for any of the @xmath42 binary function @xmath4 with @xmath43 arguments by applying only phase shifts to beams propagating to the right , cp .",
    "[ fig : diagefphase ] .",
    "alternatively , @xmath41 can be imposed using phase shifts combined with controlled bit flips , cp .",
    "[ fig : diagefcnot ] . normally , encoding the information about @xmath4 as in transformation ( [ eq : transformation ] ) is outsourced to an oracle , i.e.  a black box . here",
    "we take the standpoint that it must be possible to encode @xmath4 efficiently , otherwise the algorithm does not yield a result for a large number @xmath7 . to encode constant functions in our scheme",
    "is trivial . in case @xmath1 for all arguments @xmath3 , the transformation",
    "@xmath41 is identical to transformation ( [ inputtrafo ] ) .",
    "a global phase factor of @xmath44 appears in case @xmath45 for all @xmath3 , but can be omitted because it is physically irrelevant .    on the other hand , to generate transformation @xmath41 for the @xmath46 balanced functions is in general non - trivial .",
    "however , our scheme allows to implement balanced functions which correspond to product states efficiently by choosing whether to apply to each newly generated qubit a relative phase shift : @xmath47 this class of functions comprises @xmath48 elements corresponding to all possible combinations of relative phase shifts in @xmath12 qubits as well as a global phase shift .",
    "a small fraction of all balanced functions @xmath4 corresponding to entangled states @xmath49 can be programmed efficiently in our setup by the help of phase masks and controlled bit flips . moreover",
    ", a relabeling scheme yields all balanced functions carrying out the algorithm without changing the physical realization .",
    "the relabeling procedure can depart from any state with equal distribution of @xmath20 and @xmath30 phase factors over the localised light fields and implements a desired balanced function by suitably changing the labels of the light fields . as the renaming does not have any physical implication , the subsequent fourier transform of the electric field yields zero intensity on the optic axis in the focal plain indicating a balanced function .",
    "therefore , the renaming can be omitted , and any balanced function of @xmath15 arguments can be programmed efficiently by applying a single relative @xmath50 phase shift on the first of @xmath12 path qubits .     with @xmath43 arguments",
    "@xmath3 can be encoded in the superposition @xmath51 by means of individual @xmath50 phase shifts in the branches labeled `` 1 '' .",
    "moreover , all phase shifts on a given level of the tree can be implemented simultaneously by a single operation in the realisation scheme.,width=321 ]     and @xmath52 on different levels of the binary tree corresponds to not and controlled not operations at different depth .",
    "for example , a swap on the third level given by @xmath53 corresponds to a ccnot operation , also know as toffoli gate .",
    "each balanced function can be encoded by a specific combination of these swaps and a @xmath50 phase shift.,width=321 ]",
    "our implementation scheme to generate the superposition of @xmath15 states ( [ inputtrafo ] ) efficiently , based on dragoman s approach @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jozsa ] .",
    "a particular feature of our implementation is that it is based on classical light fields .",
    "one should note that the characteristic ingredients of quantum computation are present not only in quantum mechanics but also in classical optics .",
    "in particular , superposition , interference and a classical analog of entanglement @xcite can be produced using coherent laser sources and linear optical elements .",
    "classical optics has been employed to simulate quantum gates @xcite , to realise quantum walks @xcite as well as to implement the deutsch algorithm @xcite and the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite with classical states of light .    in the implementation ,",
    "a qubit is created by a pair of slits that are illuminated by a pulsed laser source .",
    "these slits can be opened , closed or covered partly by a phase plate .",
    "for instance , to prepare a superposition of the form @xmath54 both slits are opened .",
    "the state @xmath55 can be prepared by covering one slit of a pair with a @xmath50 phase plate . in order to understand the principle of the implementation scheme ,",
    "let us consider the first round trip inside the ring cavity .",
    "we assume that all slits are open . due to the combination of the slits s1 and s2",
    ", four distinct light dots are created as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : explain]-b . the transversal light field and",
    "thereby the four dots are rotated by a dove prism ( dp ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : explain]-c",
    ". then the light field is passed through a cylindrical lens system l1 and l2 .",
    "the combination of these lenses produces four light stripes as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : explain]-d .",
    "finally , another pair of slits ( s3 ) generates 8 light dots , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : explain]-e , by intersecting the four stripes .",
    "these steps can be repeated in order to create more dots .",
    "note , that in each round trip the number of dots doubles .",
    "furthermore , in order to minimise the overlap between dots , the distance between adjacent dots can be halved by changing the orientation of the dp .",
    "in addition , this procedure keeps the illuminated area of the light field on a transversal plane after each round trip constant ( see [ app : finite ] ) .",
    "the binary function @xmath4 is programmed in the presented setup as follows . for the constant functions @xmath1 the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jozsa ] is used without any additions . for the alternative constant function , @xmath45 for all arguments @xmath3 , the same setup can be used , since a global phase factor of @xmath30 of the electric field , does not make any detectable difference . for the balanced functions",
    "the setup is augmented by a @xmath50-phase in front of a one slit of a pair of slits . by adding more phase plates in front of other slits or in particular round trips , it is possible to construct all balanced functions that belong to product states ( [ trafo2 ] ) . finally ,",
    "the output of the cavity is fourier transformed @xcite by a lens ( l3 ) and captured in a ccd camera .",
    "light detected in the focal point behind the lens implies that the programmed function is constant , otherwise , if no light is measured the function is balanced ( see [ app : fourier ] ) .",
    "the present implementation scheme determines whether a programmed function is balanced or constant , by integrating the electric field , which carries the functional values as phase factors @xmath56 , over a transversal plane .",
    "this integration is accomplished by a thin circular lens which superimposes the light from the focal plane in front of the lens in the focal point behind the lens .",
    "hence the result of the integration stays the same , even if part of the light is superposed already during its passage through the ring cavity before the lens .",
    "therefore , the scheme tolerates overlap between light spots when they are generated . as a consequence , it is not necessary to adjust the separation of dots in each round trip by dynamically changing the orientation of the dp .",
    "in addition , the number of roundtrips and thus the number of qubits generated is not restricted by the need to avoid overlap between dots . although , above a certain degree of overlap of the spots , the qubits can not any longer be measured individually , which is not necessary in this context , they can in any case be prepared with individual relative phase shifts .",
    "we note that if the light spots can not be resolved because of their overlap , the concept of relabeling mentioned earlier becomes ambiguous",
    ". however , this is irrelevant since the relabeling can be omitted as discussed above .",
    "the main problems of optical simulations of quantum computation are pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite : the exponential growth of the number of optical devices with the number of qubits , the exponential growth in space ( cross section of the light field ) and the decrease of optical power .",
    "the present implementation scheme solves the first problem by the repeated use of the same optical elements in a ring cavity .",
    "the increase of the cross section of the light field , which results from doubling the number of light dots , can be constrained by either ( i ) adopting the orientation of the dp after each round trip ( [ app : finite ] ) or by ( ii ) the use of a lens system @xcite to compensate the increase in width of the pattern of dots without changing its height , the where the latter will compensate diffraction .",
    "finally , the optical power loss due to the filtering by the slits , might be addressed by using a pair of cylindrical lenses which can reduce each light stripe to a pair of spots . alternatively , since the scheme uses classical states of light , losses can in principle be compensated by amplification inside the cavity .    in this work , we proposed a new way to implement the deutsch - jozsa algorithm by using classical light .",
    "our scheme makes use of linear optical elements inside a ring cavity to efficiently solve the task .",
    "we are able to create @xmath15 states in @xmath12 steps while encoding the functional values in the phase of the field .",
    "an experimental realisation of the scheme will give an indication of the extend of the domain of functions that can be tested .",
    "if the problem of losses can be solved satisfactorily , we expect to exceed the capacity of the touring machines available at the time of publishing the present results .",

    "acknowledge support from the consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologa ( grant 158174 ) .",
    "by adapting the orientation of the dove prism in the setup , the number of light spots can be doubled in such a way that the minimal distance is halved , starting with initial distance @xmath57 and leading to total length @xmath58 of @xmath59 which is constant in all round trips @xmath60 the condition for the rotation of the square pattern of spots in fig [ fig : explain ] ( c ) to fig [ fig : explain ] ( d ) is given in terms of the rotation angle @xmath61 about an axis through the centre of the pattern : @xmath62 the dove prism must thus be oriented by the angle @xmath63 with respect to its longitudinal axis .",
    "if we consider the finite size of the spots we have the following relation @xmath64 where @xmath12 is the iteration inside the cavity , @xmath57 is the initial separation between spots and @xmath65 is the size of the dots .",
    "the definition of the two dimensional fourier transform of the complex function @xmath66 reads @xmath67}\\:\\text{d}x\\ : \\text{d}y,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are generally referred as the frequencies in fourier space .",
    "notice that if we evaluate at @xmath70 , the fourier transform is equivalent to @xmath71 which is the integral of the function @xmath66 over the @xmath72 plane .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that a lens can efficiently perform a two dimensional fourier transform @xcite .",
    "this means that using a lens and measuring at the origin @xmath73 defined by the optical axis in the focal plane behind the lens , we obtain the integral of the field entering the lens from the focal plane in front of the lens .",
