    "string field theory @xcite@xcite has been one of the most fundamental and the most mysterious subjects in string theory . in the course of the development",
    ", it has been clarifying the gauge interactions among higher excited states @xcite@xcite , the moduli problem at least for the open string @xcite .",
    "originally it was regarded as the only candidate to describe the non - perturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "the revolutionary developments in these years , however , the new ideas such as d - brane or m - theory turned out to play more fundamental rle . one of the shortcoming of string field theory may be that it does not has direct means to describe d - branes dynamics although there were some attempts @xcite . in this respect , people pay more interests in the alternative approaches such as the matrix models @xcite@xcite where d - brane itself becomes the dynamical variable .",
    "some years ago , a novel approach @xcite@xcite to string field theory was evolved from the matrix model view point . in the infrared ,",
    "the theory is described as a conformal field theory on the symmetric product @xmath2 .",
    "the orbifold singularities of the target are described as the twisted sectors .",
    "excitations belonging to each twisted sectors can be physically interpreted as the collections of the `` long strings '' which are composite of the fundamental string variable ( `` short string '' or `` string bit '' ) .",
    "the theory therefore contains a mechanism of the splitting / joining interactions of the closed string naturally in its definition .",
    "the partition function is expressed as the exponential of the one body partition function of the long string @xcite .",
    "this is typical structure of the partition function of the quantum field theory in the discrete lightcone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite which is not restricted to the string theory .",
    "this is the analog of the fact that the vacuum amplitude can be expressed as the exponential of the contributions from the connected feynmann diagrams in the conventional quantum field theories .",
    "these facts support the idea that the matrix string theory describes the string field theory in dlcq .    in this direction ,",
    "a steady progress was made .",
    "for example , the four point amplitudes of the string theory was directly calculated @xcite@xcite by this method to reproduce virasoro amplitude .",
    "it is applied to describe the little string theory @xcite@xcite to reproduce the black - hole entropy formula .",
    "it was generalized to heterotic matrix strings @xcite@xcite to describe the second quantized lightcone heterotic string .",
    "some aspects of the @xmath0 orbifold cft such as the modular properties and the fusion rule coefficients are studied in @xcite .",
    "a lot of the developments are made in the context of the moduli space .",
    "in particular , the instanton sectors of two dimensional yang - mills theory is related to the nontrivial topology of the matrix string world sheet @xcite@xcite .    from the mathematical viewpoint",
    ", it is originated from the calculation of the elliptic genera @xcite@xcite and has a direct relation with gtsche s formula for hilbert scheme of points @xcite and generalized kac - moody algebras .    in this paper",
    ", we study the open string version of the matrix string theory",
    ". the motivation of this subject should be obvious since we can not escape from dealing with d - branes in the matrix strings .",
    "we use the explicit calculation based on the boundary conformal field theory on the orbifold @xcite@xcite and give the some of the explicit analysis which should be made in bcft .",
    "the new material is the appearance of the long open ( closed ) strings in the twisted sector of the open string .",
    "we give the classification theorem of all the possible form of such twisted sectors .",
    "we calculate the partition function for each twisted boundary conditions and show that it can be reducible to the amplitude of the one long string .",
    "an interesting feature is the world sheet topology of the short string is in general different from that of the long string .",
    "we develop also the boundary state formalism and reproduced the amplitude .",
    "if we sum up all possible boundary conditions , the partition function can be written as the exponential of the sum of the long string partition functions .",
    "this is the typical form of the partition function in the discrete lightcone gauge .",
    "finally we confirmed that the dilaton tadpole cancellation occurs when the gauge group is famous @xmath1 for the bosonic string .",
    "let us explain the organization of this paper .",
    "we put the main claims at the beginning of each section .",
    "one may first read these parts and skip the detailed explanation or the proof until it becomes necessary .    in section 2",
    ", we give a review of the basic structure of the orbifold theory on the symmetric product .",
    "we describe it in detail since some of the explicit calculations become essential later .",
    "we emphasize the aspect that it can be formulated as the conventional non - abelian orbifold theory .",
    "namely for the torus amplitude , the consistency conditions for the twisted boundary condition contain all the information necessary to reproduce its characteristic feature of the string field theory .",
    "we also give a review of the discrete lightcone gauge and derived the typical form of its partition function .    in section 3",
    ", we investigate the constraint on the twisted boundary conditions for annulus / mbius strip / klein bottle amplitudes and relate it to the various boundary / cross - cap states @xcite@xcite .",
    "open string twisted sectors were discussed in literature @xcite@xcite mainly for the abelian case . for non - abelian case ,",
    "we need some extra care because of the non - commutativity . because the open string twisted sector is the main object in this paper ,",
    "we describe it in detail .",
    "the content of this section is generic and can be applied to arbitrary non - abelian orbifold models .    in section 4 ,",
    "we exactly solve the constraints for the symmetric product orbifold .",
    "the solution for the klein bottle amplitude is similar to the torus case . in the annulus and mbius strip cases ,",
    "there are some extra series of the solutions which will be interpreted as the contributions of the closed string sector .",
    "the content of this section is mathematical but is one of our main claim in this article .    in section 5",
    ", we calculate the one loop amplitude in two ways .",
    "first we do it by using the explicit operator formalism for the flat background .",
    "the calculation itself is technically similar to that of section 2 .",
    "second we calculate it by using multiple cover of the world sheet .",
    "the abstract combinatorial solutions in section 4 are translated into the form of the physically clear interpretation as the long string amplitudes .",
    "one interesting feature is the appearance of four sectors for the long string in _ each _ of the annulus and mbius string amplitude for the short string .",
    "namely , the topology of the world sheet seen from the long string is in general different from that for the short string as we already mentioned .    in section 6 , we give the explicit form of the boundary / cross - cap states for the arbitrary twisted sectors .",
    "we argue that the boundary state for the short string can be classified into three types .",
    "the first one is the conventional boundary state for the long string .",
    "the second one turns out to be the _ cross - cap _",
    "state for the long string .",
    "this is one of the origin of the topology change .",
    "the third one describes the connection of the two short strings .",
    "it encodes the nature of the string field theory of the orbifold theory .",
    "the cross - cap states for the short string have the similar classification .",
    "we calculate the inner product between them in order to examine the `` modular invariance '' or the tadpole condition in the next section .    in section 7 , we first prove that each of three open string sectors can be expressed as the exponential of the one - body amplitudes of the long strings of the various scale .",
    "this is quite natural as the dlcq partition function .",
    "the annulus amplitude for the short string contains all types of the amplitudes for the long string .",
    "one interesting aspect is that the torus amplitude which is contained there has the complex ( but discrete ) moduli parameter while the original annulus has only imaginary part .    in section 8",
    ", we examine the tadpole cancellation of the bosonic string in our context .",
    "we use only the annulus amplitude ( for short string ) to derive the tadpole condition . in this case",
    "there are cancellations among the massless parts of the boundary states ( of the short string ) alone .",
    "since one - string partition function is exponentiated , one may reduce the tadpole condition to each one body problem for the long string . in this form",
    ", one can immediately reproduce the famous relation such as @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) be the bosonic coordinates which define the string embedding on symmetric product @xmath6 .",

    "the order of the centralizer group is , @xmath31    the physical interpretation of these factors are well - known .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath15 is the element of the cyclic permutation of @xmath23 elements , @xmath32 here superscript @xmath33 is defined by mod @xmath23 .",
    "the twist by @xmath15 then gives the boundary condition , @xmath34 it means that @xmath23 short closed strings @xmath35 are connected with each other to form one _ long _ string of length @xmath25 .",
    "for the general situation ( [ e_conjugacy_class ] ) , we will have @xmath30 long strings of length @xmath25 for @xmath36 .",
    "the short strings that form a long string are sometimes called _",

    "the long string interpretation can be established further by the calculation of the partition function . in this subsection",
    ", we would like to give somewhat more explicit computation compared with the literature for the preparation for later sections . to make our argument clear , we first restrict the situation where target space is flat @xmath37",

    ", we studied the detailed combinatorial aspects of the open matrix string theory .",
    "we hope that our argument is convincing enough that the theory have quite reasonable structure as the second quantized open string theory .",
    "one distinct merit of current approach to conventional string field theory is the description of d - brane . from the boundary conformal field theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the classification of the possible boundary states should be interpretable as the possible geometric configuration of d - branes ( for example see @xcite@xcite ) . in our formalism",
    ", it is very straightforward to include various d - brane configurations as the description of the loose ends of the long open strings .",
    "they can be deformed by introducing the marginal transformations of the short strings .",
    "on the other hand , in the string field theory , we need the information of the d - branes in the very definition of the string fields . introduction of several d - branes may force us to introduce new string fields and the string vertex operators for each of d - branes .",
    "although this approach is useful in the calculation of the tachyon condensation @xcite@xcite , the string field theory may not give an economic description of the multiple d - brane background .",
    "this approach is also economical in the description of the string interaction vertices .",
    "as already mentioned in @xcite , there is only one open string vertex operator @xmath576 which interchanges @xmath577th and @xmath578th open strings at the boundary . in terms of the boundary states , this operator mixes the boundary / cross - cap states and the joint states , @xmath579    in the open / closed string field theory , we need to introduce seven types of the string interaction vertices @xcite .",
    "this is because the the global topology of interaction vertex becomes rather involved and we need the vertex operator for each of them . in the matrix string approach ,",
    "all of these vertices can be described in terms of one vertex @xmath576 @xcite .",
    "this is again a great benefit of the current formalism .    in case of the string field theory ,",
    "the gauge invariance of the string fields requires the gauge group should be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although we have not attempted the consistency of the vertex operator , it should reproduce the similar condition .",
    "this is one of the most important issues which should be clarified in the future .    in our discussion in section 5",
    ", we emphasized that there are no big difference between the boundary / cross - cap states and the joint states .",
    "they are three equally possible boundary states from the viewpoint of the short strings .",
    "this aspect is clearer in the action of the interaction vertex ( [ e_interaction ] ) since it mixes three boundary states . while the boundary states are the representation of the d - brane , the joint states represents a kind of string interaction . in this way",
    ", we have seen an interesting mixture of the string dynamics and d - brane .",
    "the consistency of the interaction @xmath576 will impose the possible deformation of the joint states from the knowledge of the d - branes and vice versa .    in this paper",
    ", we do not make an explicit attempt to incorporate the supersymmetry",
    ". a straightforward generalization of the closed string @xcite was already made in @xcite .",
    "these aspects are using the same type of the combinatorics as the bosonic situation does not produce extra non - triviality except for the chan - paton factor .",
    "one of the difficult point which we would like to indicate is that these vertex operators should intertwine ramond - ramond boundary states which describe the d - brane charge and the joint states .",
    "finally we have to mention that current development of the matrix string theory @xcite@xcite where the nontrivial world sheet topology is interpreted as the instanton sectors of 2d yang - mills theory .",
