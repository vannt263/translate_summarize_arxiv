    "there is a need to improve the taxonomy for comet - like bodies in the solar system .",
    "first , as a result of recent discoveries , the populations of comet - like bodies in the solar system are known to be much more extensive than previously thought .",
    "the last decade has seen the discovery of more than 600 trans - neptunian objects , beginning with ( 15760)1992qb@xmath0 ( jewitt & luu 1993 ) , as well as the identification of @xmath1100 centaurs ( e.g.  scotti 1992 ) to supplement the early serendipitous finding of ( 2060)chiron ( kowal 1979 ) .",
    "moreover , many unusual objects have now been found circulating essentially within the known planetary system , for example ( 5335)damocles ( e.g.  asher et al .  1994 ) , and the ` asteroids ' ( 4015)wilson - harrington = 107p / wilson - harrington , ( 7968)elst - pizarro = 133p / elst - pizarro and ( 2060)chiron = 95p / chiron .",
    "these objects blur the traditional clear distinction between comets and asteroids , either on physical or dynamical grounds .",
    "secondly , the spatial distribution of objects in orbits largely beyond neptune , but with aphelion distances @xmath2 much less than the conventional inner edge of the dynamically active oort cloud ( @xmath3au , say ) , is believed to comprise a flattened disc or belt - like structure .",
    "these objects have orbits that in some cases extend hundreds of astronomical units ( au ) from the sun , and although resembling asteroids in appearance are widely thought to be cometary in composition .",
    "this trans - neptunian zone includes the region referred to as the kuiper or edgeworth - kuiper belt ( ekb ) , and probably merges in the form of an extended trans - neptunian disc into the inner core of the oort cometary cloud .",
    "trans - neptunian objects are a possibly significant source of low - inclination ` jupiter - family ' comets ( quinn , tremaine & duncan 1990 ) , again muddying the traditional distinction between comets and asteroids .",
    "in fact , the centaur population appears to represent an important link between trans - neptunian objects and jupiter - family comets ( dones , levison & duncan 1996 , stern & campins 1996 , levison & duncan 1997 ) .",
    "centaur orbits are typically planet - crossing and have relatively short dynamical lifetimes ( @xmath1@xmath4yr ) .",
    "chiron , which is one of a number of exceptionally large minor bodies with perihelia close to or within the orbit of saturn , exhibits cometary activity ( e.g.  luu & jewitt 1990 ) and even has a periodic comet designation : 95p / chiron .",
    "at least one recently discovered comet , namely c/2001t4 ( neat ) , has a very similar chiron - like centaur orbit .",
    "taken together , the evidence suggests a picture in which comets and distant minor planets are dynamically reprocessed from one population to another , for example from the edgeworth - kuiper belt , through centaurs to jupiter - family comets , and so on .",
    "similarly , it is possible for objects to be scattered out of the main asteroid belt and evolve into similar areas .",
    "so , it is possible that some centaurs may be rocky or asteroidal , others may be icy or cometary .",
    "this is analagous to the examples given by fernndez , gallardo & brunini ( 2002 ) of mixing between the jupiter - family and near - earth asteroid populations , and again highlights both the difficulty of separating physically distinct populations of objects using purely dynamical characteristics , and the need for a unified dynamical classification scheme capable of describing the full range of observed orbital types .    in parallel with these observational advances ,",
    "the march of computer power now ensures that the orbits of most solar system bodies can be routinely integrated for millions of years .",
    "given the wealth of simulation data and the diversity of new discoveries , the taxonomy of solar system objects assumes great importance . for a classification scheme to be useful ,",
    "it should allow us to place objects with similar physical or dynamical characteristics in sets , and to examine the bulk statistics of the sets in detail .",
    "however , in making sense of the complicated evolutionary pathways followed by objects such as short - period comets and centaurs , the historical classification scheme seems obsolete .",
    "a new taxonomy should clarify the principal dynamical paths followed by different classes of object through interplanetary space , and facilitate the definition of dynamical lifetimes and the flux and transfer probabilities of objects from one dynamical class to another .",
    "traditionally , comets have been classified as short - period or long - period according to whether their periods of revolution @xmath5 are less than or greater than 200  years .",
    "this unphysical division ( levison 1996 ) has frequently been justified in terms of the time over which comets have been observed with scientific precision ( e.g.weissman 2001 ) .",
    "but , the canonical upper limit for ` periodic ' comets has now been spectacularly broken by the return of 153p / ikeya - zhang with an orbital period in excess of 350  years , and also by recent discoveries such as asteroid 2002rp@xmath6 with a period of about 420yr .",
    "centaurs are conventionally defined as asteroids or cometary nuclei circulating largely between the orbits of jupiter and neptune and usually crossing the orbit of at least one giant planet ( e.g.  jedicke & herron 1997 , larsen et al .",
    "jedicke & herron s definition restricts centaur semi - major axes to less than that of neptune ( i.e.  @xmath7au ) , and therefore allows objects defined as centaurs to pass significantly beyond neptune s orbit into the edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "a straightforward extension of this definition would allow centaurs to be regarded simply as a continuation of the ` scattered disc objects ' , perhaps even encompassing those resonant objects that are not protected in the long term from close approaches to neptune .",
    "the scattered disc was the name introduced by duncan & levison ( 1997 ) following the discovery of 1996tl@xmath8 ( luu et al .",
    "1997 ) to describe a population of relatively high - inclination , high - eccentricity trans - neptunian objects .",
    "the idea that centaurs and the scattered disc may be drawn from the same underlying population has been advocated recently both by marsden ( 1999a ) and by emelyanenko , asher & bailey ( 2003 ) .",
    "this paper introduces a new classification scheme for comet - like bodies of the solar system .",
    "there is much evidence from previous work ( e.g.kazimirchak-polonskaya 1972 ; kresk 1972 , 1980 , 1983 ; everhart 1977 ; rickman & froeschl 1988 ; manara & valsecchi 1991 ; dones et al .",
    "1996 ; levison 1996 ) that the evolution of comets and centaurs often takes place under the control of one or another major planet , usually with near - constant aphelion or near - constant perihelion , or via aphelion - perihelion interchanges .",
    "this motivates us to consider the planets controlling the perihelion @xmath9 and aphelion @xmath2 as fundamental to the classification of any comet - like bodies .",
    "there is also evidence that low - inclination objects tend to evolve inwards , whereas the reverse is true for high - inclination objects .",
    "this suggests that we use the inclination  or better still , the tisserand parameter @xmath10 with respect to the controlling planet  as a third criterion .",
    "the tisserand parameter is an approximate constant of the motion , at least when the orbital perturbations are dominated by a single planet .",
    "given the set of values ( @xmath11 ) , our new taxonomy provides an instantaneous classification for any comet - like body in the solar system .",
    "the hill radius is defined as @xmath12^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the mass of the planet , @xmath14 is the mass of the sun and @xmath15 is the semi - major axis of the orbit of the planet about the sun ( e.g.  murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the position of the lagrange points in the restricted three - body problem ( e.g.  arnold et al .",
    "1987 ) and so marks the largest distance at which the planet may possess a moon .",
    "a solar system object can be classified according to the planets which have the greatest effect at perihelion and at aphelion . for typical eccentricities ,",
    "a perihelion lying 4 or 5 hill radii beyond an inner planet is often sufficiently distant for the dynamics to be controlled by the outer planet .",
    "so , we conclude that for a planet to control an object , then the perihelion or aphelion must lie closer than a distance of @xmath163 hill radii to the planet s orbit ( see e.g. , charnoz , thbault & brahic 2001 ) .    in our classification scheme ,",
    "each planet s zone of control extends to @xmath17 hill radii , with the parameter @xmath18 . in this way",
    ", the solar system is banded into concentric zones of control of first jupiter , then saturn , uranus and neptune . over the next few million years the mean semi - major axes and maximum aphelia of the four major planets jupiter ,",
    "saturn , uranus and neptune are ( 5.2 , 5.5 ) , ( 9.6 , 10.4 ) , ( 19.2 , 20.8 ) and ( 30.1 , 31.0)au respectively ( applegate et al",
    ".  1986 ) .",
    "three times their hill radii are 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.4 and 2.3au respectively .",
    "these distances provide a rough basis for estimating the respective boundaries between the zones of control .",
    "for example , for jupiter to control the object at perihelion , the perihelion must lie between 4 and 6.6 au approximately . if the aphelion also lies in the range",
    ", then we classify the minor body as a j object . for saturn to control the object at aphelion , then @xmath19 when the object is denoted by js",
    ". we will give detailed examples shortly , but the general idea should now be obvious to the reader .",
    "the tisserand parameter is an approximation to the jacobi constant , which is an exact integral of motion in the circular restricted three - body problem .",
    "it is defined as ( e.g.  murray & dermott 1999 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the planet s semi - major axis .    ignoring the positive orbital eccentricity of the planet , objects with @xmath10 greater than 3",
    "are in principle confined to regions wholly interior or wholly exterior to the planet s orbit .",
    "there is a long history of usage of the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter @xmath22 to divide the cometary families ( e.g. , kresk 1972 , 1980 , 1982 , 1983 , 1985 ; vaghi 1973 a , b ; carusi & valsecchi 1987 ; levison & duncan 1994 ; levison 1996 ) .",
    "[ fig : cometpop ] shows all short - period comets in the plane of semi - major axis @xmath15 and eccentricity @xmath23 .",
    "the comets have been colour - coded according to their tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter .",
    "motivated by these plots , we propose a four - fold division according to tisserand parameter as indicated in table  [ t1 ] .",
    ".definition of tisserand parameter classification scheme .",
    "the boundary near @xmath24 marks the limit above which it is impossible for an object to be directly ejected in a single encounter .

    "table  [ table : centaurs ] gives the classification scheme for objects under the control of giant planets other than jupiter .",
    "as before , the notation is that the first letter designates the planet controlling the perihelion , and the second letter the planet controlling the aphelion or the region in which the aphelion lies .",
    "so , a un object has a perihelion controlled by uranus and an aphelion controlled by neptune , and so on .",
    "the letters ek denote objects with perihelia and aphelia lying close to or within the classical kuiper or edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "trans - ek belt or t objects , on the other hand , may have much larger aphelion distances , and ( perhaps depending on their perihelion distances ) may be stable ` outer ' objects as described by emelyanenko et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , or dynamically active objects similar to those conventionally known as scattered disc objects . both ek and t classes",
    "have perihelia beyond neptune s control ( 33.5 au ) but less than the conventional outer edge of the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( @xmath1 60 au ) .",
    "they differ in that the aphelion @xmath2 is less than approximately 60 au for the former and greater than 60 au for the latter . as for the comets ,",
    "the information on the zone of control must be supplemented with the tisserand parameter with respect to the controlling planet to give a complete classification .",
    "the tisserand parameter class is given as a subscript .",
    "it is interesting to note the recent discovery of several high - inclination centaurs , for example 2002vq@xmath25 and 2002xu@xmath26 , which we classify as st@xmath27 and ut@xmath27 respectively .",
    "the first centaur discovered , ( 2060 ) chiron , has a perihelion distance of 8.4 au and an aphelion of 18.8 au .",
    "it is classified as an su@xmath28 object , as its tisserand parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this is one of the largest centaurs and is active at perihelion .",
    "hahn & bailey ( 1990 ) showed that chiron s orbit is rapidly evolving and that it may have been a short - period comet in the past , and will probably become one again in the future .",
    "the second centaur discovered , ( 5145 ) pholus , has a perihelion of 8.7 au and an aphelion of 32.1 au , together with a tisserand parameter @xmath30 of 2.6 .",
    "it is classified as an sn@xmath31 object .",
    "pholus s orbit is also unstable with a characteristic lifetime of @xmath32 yr . as another example , ( 10199 ) chariklo has a perihelion of 13.1 au which is just within uranus s control and an aphelion of 18.6 au .",
    "its tisserand parameter with respect to uranus is 2.9 , making its classification u@xmath33 .",
    "chariklo s orbit is more stable than either chiron s or pholus s , as the dynamical lifetime is roughly a factor of 10 times longer .",
    "not all orbits in this part of the solar system are evolving .",
    "for example , holman ( 1997 ) found that a few low - eccentricity objects between 24 and 27 au ( @xmath10.3% of an initial low - eccentricity primordial sample ) may survive for 4.5 gyr without significant dynamical evolution .",
    "these objects lie in the n@xmath28 class .",
    "others ( e.g.  2001qr@xmath34 , also classified as n@xmath28 ) are recognized as long - lived neptune - trojans ( marsden 2003 ) , and it is probably only a matter of time before similar examples of trojans are confirmed around uranus as well .",
    "almost all the known centaurs lie within the tisserand parameter classes iii and iv .",
    "there are only a few exceptions  for example , 2000 fz@xmath35 has a tisserand parameter with respect to its controlling planet ( uranus ) of 2.4",
    ". however , the nearly isotropic influx from the oort cloud must inevitably produce at least a few high - inclination centaurs .",
    "hence , the other classes are needed , and their apparent emptiness at present is largely a selection effect .",
    "[ fig : centaurpop ] shows the plane of semi - major axis and eccentricity .",
    "the red circles show the current location of the 52 objects listed as centaurs and scattered disk objects in 2002 june by the minor planet center .",
    "a further 16 objects lie at semi - major axes too great to be seen on the plot .",
    "these objects were chosen from the full list of centaurs by requiring the observable arc to be greater than 30 days .",
    "objects with shorter arcs are excluded as their orbits often change substantially from the original estimates when the arc is extended .",
    "the known population depends both on the true numbers in the various regions and on discovery selection effects .",
    "orbits under the control of uranus and neptune are expected to be more long - lived than those under the control of saturn and jupiter .",
    "however , this is counterbalanced by the fact that objects nearer the sun are more easily discovered .",
    "the question can be studied further by modelling the efficiency of observational surveys ( jedicke & herron 1997 ) . for the present centaur population ,",
    "there is a suggestion in fig .",
    "[ fig : centaurpop ] of a substantial population in the ue category .",
    "these may be being scattered down from planet to planet having originated in the edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "the green circles in fig .  [ fig : centaurpop ] show the current classification of those 373 objects with arcs greater than 30 days belonging to the edgeworth - kuiper belt . again",
    ", our data were downloaded in june 2002 from the minor planet center .",
    "the two most populous categories are ne and ek .",
    "the plutinos , a population of objects trapped in the 2:3 mean - motion resonance with neptune ( e.g.jewitt & luu 1996 ) , fall into either the ne or ek category depending on eccentricity .",
    "the resonance acts to prevent close approaches to neptune , although it is unlikely that such a mechanism would generally protect all the objects from eventual encounters with neptune over time - scales comparable to the age of the solar system .",
    "the ek category contains most of what are conventionally called the ` classical ' kuiper or edgeworth - kuiper belt population , while the t category contains most of what are conventionally called scattered disc objects .",
    "these last two classes can be further subdivided ( emelyanenko et al .",
    "we now illustrate the usefulness of the classification scheme with some examples drawn from a suite of numerical simulations .",
    "clones of the current centaur population are integrated in the forward and backward direction for up to 6 myr using the hybrid integrator in the mercury program ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "the orbits are integrated under the gravitational effects of the sun and the four major planets only .",
    "the time - step is 120 days .",
    "once objects passed beyond 1000au , their orbits are no longer followed .",
    "[ fig : centaurone ] shows the evolution of a clone of 2000fz@xmath35 . for most of the first 1 myr",
    "its perihelion is under the control of uranus and its aphelion lies in the edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "the tisserand parameter with respect to uranus is @xmath37 .",
    "the clone starts off as an se@xmath36 object and moves rapidly into the ue@xmath36 zone .    during the course of the simulation ,",
    "the clone is driven gradually towards a stable orbit with perihelion close to neptune ( an ne object ) .",
    "this illustrates one route by which an object can approach the edgeworth - kuiper belt from the centaur region .",
    "there are two sharp transitions visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : centaurone ] .",
    "the first change , at 2.0myr from un to ue , is caused by a close encounter at aphelion with neptune ; the second , at 2.9myr within the ue category , is caused by an encounter at perihelion with uranus . at the end of the 6myr simulation",
    ", the object has a perihelion just beyond the orbit of neptune , a high inclination , and a low eccentricity .",
    "the value of its tisserand parameter with respect to neptune is @xmath38 .",
    "the orbit is similar to those of a number of objects currently residing in the inner regions of the edgeworth - kuiper belt , such as 1999cp@xmath39 .",
    "the stability of the semi - major axis towards the end of the 2000fz@xmath35 simulation suggests that it lies in a mean - motion resonance with neptune .",
    "this is borne out by calculation of the orbital period of the clone , which is @xmath1202yr , suggesting that the object probably lies in the 4:5 mean - motion resonance with neptune ( period @xmath1164yr ) .",
    "it is possible that the orbit will continue to drift outward and stabilize after the end of the simulation , illustrating a rather rare example of outward rather than inward evolution .",
    "the ultimate destiny of such an object may therefore be to join the edgeworth - kuiper belt or the region beyond it .",
    "[ fig : centaurtwo ] shows the evolution of a clone of chiron ( cf.hahn & bailey 1990 ) .",
    "this object illustrates one of the supply routes for the short - period comets .",
    "the clone starts with its perihelion under the control of saturn , but its aphelion wanders between the control of saturn , uranus and neptune respectively for the first @xmath40 yr .",
    "after this , the clone falls under jupiter s control through a succession of aphelion - perihelion interchanges .",
    "the tisserand parameter @xmath22 falls below 3 and the clone spends the next part of its lifetime ( @xmath41yr ) as a short - period comet before leaving the sp region .",
    "this is longer than the typical fading time ( @xmath42yr ) for jupiter - family comets found by levison & duncan ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that this 200 km diameter object has a significant probability of evolving to an orbit with perihelion distance less than that of the earth ( hahn & bailey 1990 ) .",
    "this emphasizes the potential significance for the inner solar system of so - called ` giant ' comets and their disintegration products when time - scales of the order of @xmath43yr or more are considered ( e.g. , napier 2001 ) . from the characteristic shape of the trajectory in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : centaurtwo ] , we see that the evolution proceeds along lines of roughly constant perihelion or aphelion both before and after the object comes under jupiter s control .",
    "the part of the clone s life when it is controlled by jupiter is characterized by it being highly chaotic and showing rapid dynamical evolution .",
    "note that the clone starts with a tisserand parameter with respect to saturn @xmath29 . during its lifetime as a short - period comet , its tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter @xmath44 .",
    "just as in our previous example , the tisserand parameter with respect to the controlling planet is nearly preserved during the whole evolution .",
    "the fact that the clone stays in an area in which it will be active as a comet for such a long time suggests that cometary bodies can be captured into the inner solar system for long enough to have a reasonable chance of decoupling from jupiter , whether by non - gravitational forces such as outgassing ( cf .",
    "kresk 1982 , harris & bailey 1998 , asher , bailey & steel 2001 ) or collisional mechanisms .",
    "integrations occasionally provide examples of encke - type orbits evolving to become jupiter - family short - period comets , but the reverse evolution by gravitational means is so rare that it has never been seen ( carusi & valsecchi 1987 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the stability of an orbit approaching saturn is lower than one approaching merely uranus or neptune .",
    "similarly , an orbit in the vicinity of jupiter is yet more unstable .",
    "this adds weight to our argument that classifying all objects in the trans - jovian region merely as ` centaurs ' is insufficient to explain the full richness of dynamical behaviour in the region .",
    "[ fig : centaurthree ] shows the evolution of a clone of 1998 tf@xmath45 .",
    "it starts off as a ue object with tisserand parameter @xmath46 .",
    "this object is of interest since it passes through a number of different categories ( ue , un , ne , n , u , su and s ) before finally becoming a short - period comet and then suffering ejection from the solar system .",
    "generally , it moves through the categories sequentially rather than frequently jumping back and forth between classes .",
    "the clone begins in an orbit influenced both by neptune and uranus , and distant encounters provide gradual perturbations for most of its lifetime .",
    "eventually , encounters with neptune move the object into a near - circular orbit controlled only by that planet .",
    "this period of evolution ends with a close encounter which moves the clone s perihelion back to the control of uranus .",
    "the perihelion drops further until the object encounters saturn , at which point it is rapidly handed down to jupiter s control , where it becomes a short - period comet for a brief time ( @xmath47yr ) before being ejected from the solar system .",
    "whilst a short - period comet , @xmath48 , so there is again excellent conservation of the tisserand parameter with respect to the controlling planet .      as a final example ,",
    "let us consider two objects conventionally classified as short - period jupiter - family comets , namely p/1997t3 ( lagerkvist - carsenty ) and p/1998u3 ( jger ) .",
    "numerical integrations by lagerkvist et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that both objects suffered recent close encounters with saturn that drastically changed their orbits .",
    "[ fig : lagerkvist ] shows the evolution of the orbits of both comets over the last century .",
    "comet lagerkvist - carsenty started out as an su@xmath28 object in january 1900 . a close encounter with saturn in october 1954 transferred its osculating elements through almost instantaneous sn and se phases into its present js@xmath28 orbit .",
    "this proceeded through a perihelion - aphelion interchange , with the old perihelion becoming the new aphelion .",
    "by contrast , comet jger started as an s@xmath31 object in january 1900 and underwent a direct transition to its present sp@xmath36 orbit in july 1991 .",
    "the evolution proceeded at nearly constant aphelion , as can be deduced both from the plot of the orbit and from its evolutionary track in the plane of semi - major axis and eccentricity . in this case , the close approach caused the tisserand parameter class to change , the controlling planet switching from saturn to jupiter .",
    "these orbital integrations provide illustrations of why the classification scheme is useful .",
    "the scheme is based around the aphelion and perihelion distances .",
    "close encounters often preserve aphelion or perihelion to lowest order , or a perihelion - aphelion interchange may take place .",
    "very often , the tisserand parameter with respect to the controlling planet is conserved to a good approximation as well .",
    "the main aim of the paper is to introduce a new classification system for comet - like bodies . minor bodies between saturn and neptune are often described simply as ` centaurs ' and those beyond neptune simply as ` kuiper belt objects ' .",
    "this is not very enlightening as the histories and fates of such bodies may be very different .",
    "for example , simulations show that some centaurs are in long - lived and stable orbits , whereas others are dynamically highly active and will evolve rapidly .",
    "the main focus of this paper has been on the centaurs and short - period comets .",
    "our proposition is to classify the comet - like objects beyond jupiter according to the planets that control the evolution of their perihelion and aphelion .",
    "for example , an sn object has a perihelion under the control of saturn and an aphelion under the control of neptune , while a ue object has a perihelion under the control of uranus and an aphelion in the edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "this provides 20 dynamically distinct categories of outer solar system objects in the jovian and trans - jovian regions .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of bodies like centaurs often show periods in which the aphelion or perihelion distances are individually rather well conserved , or encounters in which the old perihelion becomes the new aphelion or vice versa ( ` perihelion - aphelion interchanges ' ) .",
    "the objects with smaller perihelion distances , which we designate as ` comets ' , are dominated by jupiter and not by the planets nearest at perihelion or aphelion . in our scheme",
    ", comets have perihelion distance less than 4 au .",
    "they are subdivided into encke - type , short - period , intermediate - period and long - period according to aphelion distance . following a succession of authors beginning with kresk ( 1972 ) , we favour further sub - divisions based on the tisserand parameter .",
    "specifically , we subdivide the categories of comets into : class i which has @xmath49 , class ii which has @xmath50 , class iii having @xmath51 and class iv having @xmath52 .",
    "very roughly , these can be thought of as corresponding to halley - types , transition - types , loosely bound jupiter - family comets and tightly bound jupiter - family comets respectively .",
    "this idea is then extended to all comet - like bodies by identifying the tisserand parameter of the planet controlling the perihelion with a subscript .",
    "given the aphelion and perihelion distance , together with the tisserand parameter of the planet controlling the perihelion , it is straightforward to find the instantaneous classification of any solar system object .",
    "our new classification scheme extends the existing taxonomy for comets to cover all comet - like bodies in the solar system .",

    "<S> a new classification scheme is introduced for comet - like bodies in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> it covers the traditional comets as well as the centaurs and edgeworth - kuiper belt objects . at low inclinations , </S>",
    "<S> close encounters with planets often result in near - constant perihelion or aphelion distances , or in perihelion - aphelion interchanges , so the minor bodies can be labelled according to the planets predominantly controlling them at perihelion and aphelion . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a jn object has a perihelion under the control of jupiter and aphelion under the control of neptune , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> this provides 20 dynamically distinct categories of outer solar system objects in the jovian and trans - jovian regions . </S>",
    "<S> the tisserand parameter with respect to the planet controlling perihelion is also often roughly constant under orbital evolution . </S>",
    "<S> so , each category can be further sub - divided according to the tisserand parameter .    the dynamical evolution of comets , however , is dominated not by the planets nearest at perihelion or aphelion , but by the more massive jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> the comets are separated into four categories  encke - type , short - period , intermediate and long - period  according to aphelion distance . </S>",
    "<S> the tisserand parameter categories now roughly correspond to the well - known jupiter - family comets , transition - types and halley - types . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the nomenclature for the centaurs and edgeworth - kuiper belt objects is based on , and consistent with , that for comets . given the perihelion and aphelion distances together with the tisserand parameter </S>",
    "<S> , our classification scheme provides a description for any comet - like body in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of the scheme is illustrated with examples drawn from numerical simulations and from the present - day solar system .    </S>",
