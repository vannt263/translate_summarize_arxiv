    "light sterile neutrinos with mass at the electron volt ( ev ) scale have gathered serious attention in the last few years after several experiments started suggesting additional light degrees of freedom beyond the three active neutrinos of the standard model . for a review ,",
    "please see @xcite .",
    "the nine year wilkinson mass anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data created lots of interest in light sterile neutrinos by constraining the number of light degrees of freedom to be@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this observation was however not fully supported by the recently reported data of the planck collaboration which show a preference towards the standard three light neutrino picture with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "apart from the hints from cosmology experiments , there have also been evidence from anomalous results in accelerator and reactor based neutrino experiments .",
    "the anomalous results in anti - neutrino flux measurements at the lsnd accelerator experiment @xcite provided the first hint of light sterile neutrinos .",
    "the lsnd results have also been supported by the latest data released by the miniboone experiment @xcite .",
    "similar anomalies have also been observed at nuclear reactor neutrino experiments @xcite as well as gallium solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "these anomalies suggesting the presence of light sterile neutrinos have led to global short - baseline neutrino oscillation data favoring two light sterile neutrinos within the ev range @xcite .",
    "some more interesting discussions on light sterile neutrinos from cosmology as well as neutrino experiments point of view can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus , the hints in favor of sub - ev scale sterile neutrinos have led to a model building challenge to explain the origin of three light active neutrinos together with one or two sterile neutrinos within the same mass range . some interesting proposals along these lines have appeared recently in @xcite .",
    "a nice review of some of the earlier works can also be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , we discussed the possible origin of sub - ev scale active and sterile neutrino mass within the framework of a radiative neutrino mass model @xcite . in that work , an abelian gauge extention of the standard model , first discussed in @xcite",
    "was suitably modified in order to accommodate ev scale sterile neutrino masses .",
    "the salient feature of the model is the way it relates dark matter with neutrino mass where neutrino masses arise at one loop level with dark matter particles running inside the loops : more popularly known as `` scotogenic '' model @xcite .",
    "the model allows the natural existence of a cold dark matter candidate which is stabilized by a remnant @xmath0 symmetry after the abelian gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the dark matter phenomenology in this model was studied in @xcite and more recently in @xcite to explain the galactic center gamma ray excess . in the modified version of this model , as discussed in @xcite , it is possible to accommodate three active and one sterile neutrinos with ev scale masses . but to allow non - trivial mixing of light sterile neutrino with the active neutrinos , the remnamt @xmath0 symmetry of the original model had to be sacrificed thereby losing the cold dark matter candidate . in the present work ,",
    "we propose a modified version of this model which not only allows active and sterile neutrino masses and mixings at sub - ev scale but also keep the remnant @xmath0 symmetry unbroken at low energy . although our motivation in this work is to provide a common framework for sub - ev scale sterile neutrino and cold dark matter , it is straightforward to accommodate kev scale sterile neutrino as well which could give rise to scenario of warm dark matter .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we briefly discuss our model . in section [ sec : numass ] and [ sec : stmass ] we discuss the origin of sub - ev scale active and sterile neutrino masses respectively .",
    "we discuss the origin of active - sterile neutrino mixing in section [ sec : acstmass ] . in section",
    "[ sec : darkmatter ] , we briefly discuss the dark matter phenomenology in this model and then finally conclude in section [ sec : results ] .",
    ".particle content of the model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the analysis of dark matter in this model is similar to that done in @xcite apart from the fact that there is one additional scalar singlet candidate @xmath3 for dark matter in this present model .",
    "here we summarise the earlier analysis taking into account of the latest constraints on dark matter relic density from planck 2013 data @xcite .",
    "we also use the latest constraints on spin independent direct detection cross section from lux 2013 data @xcite and spin dependent direct detection cross section from xenon100 experiment @xcite . in our model",
    "there are three fermionic and three scalar candidates for dark matter as they are odd under the remnant @xmath0 symmetry . here",
    "we briefly discuss the dark matter phenomenology for the singlet fermion and scalar doublet dark matter in the low mass range @xmath4 gev .",
    "the analysis of fermion triplet and scalar singlet dark matter are similar and will be skipped here .",
    "the relic abundance of a dark matter particle @xmath5 is given by the the boltzmann equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number density of the dark matter particle @xmath5 and @xmath8 is the number density when @xmath5 was in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath9 is the hubble rate and @xmath10 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the dark matter particle @xmath5 . in terms of partial wave expansion @xmath11 , one obtains the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation above as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath15 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of freeze - out .",
    "dark matter particles with electroweak scale mass and couplings freeze out at temperatures approximately in the range @xmath16 .",
    "further simplifications to the solution has been made @xcite : @xmath17 the thermal averaged annihilation cross section @xmath18 is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 s are modified bessel functions of order @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the mass of dark matter particle and @xmath23 is the temperature .     plane .",
    "the red line refers to the conservative lux 2013 upper bound on dark matter nucleon spin independent cross - section . ]",
    "there are singlet and triplet types of fermionic dark matter candidates in our model . as discussed above to calculate relic abundance of any dark matter candidate one",
    "is required to identify all possible annihilation processes and find the thermal averaged cross sections . in our model",
    "the singlet fermion @xmath24 has no direct coupling to the standard model particles .",
    "however , it is charged under the additional gauge group @xmath25 .",
    "considering the mixing between x boson and the electroweak gauge bosons , the dominant annihilation channel is the one in which a pair of @xmath24 can annihilate into standard model fermion pairs through s - channel x boson .",
    "however , with almost zero mixing condition as discussed earlier this is not the dominant channel .",
    "the majorana fermion annihilation with s - channel gauge boson mediation was calculated in @xcite which have been adopted here for our calculation .    in the annihilation cross - section",
    "there are several free parameters like gauge charges @xmath26 , gauge coupling @xmath27 , symmetry breaking scale of @xmath25 as well as the mass of the singlet fermion @xmath24 . for the gauge charges , we use the normalization @xmath28 which was considered earlier by @xcite to compute the exclusion plot on @xmath29 at @xmath30 confidence level . in the exclusion plot on @xmath29 shown in @xcite",
    "the lowest allowed value of @xmath29 was found to be approximately @xmath31 tev for @xmath32 . for fixed values of dark matter mass as well as @xmath33 , we vary @xmath27 , @xmath34 and mass of dark matter @xmath35 and compute the dark matter relic density",
    ". the points in the plot [ fig1 ] satisfy the dark matter relic density bound @xmath36 from planck experiment @xcite as well as the dark matter direct detection bounds .",
    "being a majorana fermion , @xmath24 can contribute only to spin dependent dark matter - nucleon cross section and hence one can avoid the stringent bounds on spin - dependent cross section from xenon100 experiment @xcite .",
    "we follow the analysis of reference @xcite to find out the spin dependent dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section and use the numerical values of nucleon spin fraction carried by the quarks as discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "xenon100 experiment gives the lowest upper bound on spin dependent cross section as @xmath37 for a wimp mass of 45 gev at @xmath30 confidence level .",
    "here we take this conservative upper bound for all dark matter mass between 10 - 100 gev .",
    "similar to our discussion on the fermionic dark matter scenario , the lightest @xmath0-odd scalar could also be a possible dark matter candidate .",
    "here we discuss in brief the results for the scalar doublet case .",
    "this analysis is similar to the inert doublet model of dark matter discussed earlier in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider the small mass window for the scalar doublet dark matter for which @xmath38 , the w boson mass . beyond the w boson mass threshold ,",
    "the annihilation channel of scalar doublet dark matter into @xmath39 pairs opens up resulting in the reduction of the relic abundance of dark matter below observed range for dark matter mass approximately below @xmath40 gev .",
    "one may note however , that there exists a region of parameter space @xmath41 gev which satisfy relic density bound if certain cancellations occur between several annihilation diagrams @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we stick to particularly the low mass region @xmath42 in this analysis .",
    "the annihilation cross section of scalar doublet dark matter @xmath43 into fermion - antifermion pairs is computed through standard model like higgs boson @xmath44 . as the standard model higgs boson coupling to fermions",
    "are well known , essentially the only free parameters in the annihilation cross section are the dark matter - higgs coupling @xmath45 and dark matter mass @xmath46 .",
    "the v - shaped blue region in figure [ fig4 ] shows the parameter space in @xmath47 plane which satisfies the relic density bound . to implement the direct detection constraints on spin independent scatterring cross section from lux experiment @xcite",
    ", we use the higgs boson mediated spin independent scattering cross section @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass .",
    "we use the recent estimate of the higgs - nucleon coupling @xmath50 @xcite although the full range of allowed values is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the red solid line in figure [ fig4 ] corresponds to the minimum upper limit on the dark matter - nucleon spin independent cross section of @xmath52 from lux experiment @xcite .",
    "motivated by the tantalizing hints from cosmology as well as neutrino oscillation experiments favouring the possible existence of sterile neutrinos , we have studied an abelian extension of the standard model with anomaly free combination of three right handed singlet and two triplet fermions . the abelian gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken down to a remnant @xmath0 symmetry such that the lightest @xmath0 odd particle could play the role of dark matter .",
    "the scalar sector of the model is chosen in such a way that three active and one sterile neutrinos can acquire masses at electron volt scale . at tree level , only one active neutrino acquires masses through type i seesaw mechanism whereas two active and one sterile neutrino remain massless . at one loop level , all the three active and one sterile neutrinos receive non - zero mass contribution at ev scale . due to the loop suppression factor",
    ", the new physics scale could be as low as tev scale without paying the price of fine - tuning the dimensionless parameters .",
    "this could have interesting signatures in the collider experiments .",
    "this model also allows non - zero mixing between active and sterile neutrinos at loop level and hence can provide a suitable explanation to reactor neutrino anomalies .    due to the remnant",
    "@xmath0 symmetry in our model , the lightest @xmath0 odd particle is stable and hence can play the role of dark matter .",
    "we briefly discuss the case of fermion singlet and scalar doublet dark matter in the low mass range @xmath4 gev and show how the latest experimental data can be satisfied within the framework of our model .",
    "although the original motivation of our work is to put forward a common mechanism for masses and mixing of ev scale active and sterile neutrino with dark matter , this model can also be studied in order to explain kev scale sterile neutrino which can play the role of warm dark matter .",
    "although the light sterile neutrino in our model is not protected by the remnant @xmath0 symmetry , its mass and mixing with active neutrinos can be suitably adjusted in such a way that its lifetime exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "this will give rise to a mixed dark matter scenario where the lightest @xmath0 odd particle acts as a cold dark matter candidate whereas the kev scale sterile neutrino acts as a warm dark matter candidate .",
    "we leave a detailed study of dark matter phenomenology in this scenario to future studies .",
