    "are there conditions to have a physical - noise secured internet ( nsi)-instead of a relying on the difficulty of factoring numbers in primes- implemented for common users ?",
    "the answer is yes ; and the associated cost is very low  this paper shows how it can be immediately implemented .    let us start with the following classical scenario : user a ( alice ) uses a ( private ) laptop with no network or web access to encrypt a message @xmath0 onto a file @xmath1 to be sent to end user b ( bob ) .",
    "the encryption is done with a one - time - pad key sequence of truly random bits stored in his computer .",
    "this random sequence was beforehand shared with b. file c is fully characterized and transferred to a computer with web access . from this point on file c is appended with all identification information , split into different packets as demanded by the internet protocol ( ip ) stack @xcite and routed through any available physical link to the end user b .",
    "all modifications are done according to the requirements of the open systems interconnection ( osi ) layers and protocols @xcite including particularities demanded by web service providers . among these procedures",
    "error correction protocols are included . at the destination ,",
    "file c is assembled bit - by - bit and delivered to b. stripped from communication information attached to it , b checks for file integrity and decrypt c using the shared random sequence .",
    "the obtained message has unconditionally proven confidentiality and authentication .",
    "these procedures are independent of any established internet security protocol .",
    "it is expected that internet should not modify the bit content of the original file after its full recover by b. in case a and b are performing a commercial operation , non - repudiation is easily assured to both users .",
    "the one - time - pad protocol is not intended to modify the internet protocols in anyway .",
    "it is a complementary method for secure communication between two users that works independently and on top of all ip protocols .",
    "a and b have their secure communication totally under their control .",
    "this way , the users know that their protection does not rely on mathematical difficulties to factoring number in primes nor they depend on third parties to assure the desired security .    the reader may be saying : but this is a classical encryption between two users and well known to be secure ; there is nothing physical or new here . however , is this scenario realistic if a and b wishes to use it continuously ?",
    "the answer to this question has been negative : the practical difficulties for a and b to keep sharing long sequences of one - time - pad keys makes this scenario highly inefficient and , therefore , useless for most uses .",
    "practical systems have not yet been devised that allow a and b to use the starting secret @xmath2 as a support to transfer or exchange fresh sequences of random numbers .",
    "this work shows a practical way that allows a and b to share through the internet these new sequences of random keys in a secure way .",
    "this could bring life to the starting scenario .",
    "the basic ingredients needed are a very simple software , a physical random generator ( not a pseudo random generator ) coupled to the private computer and a starting secret key @xmath2 shared by a and b. this starting sequence @xmath2 will seed a long sequence of truly random bits . in a sense , it can be seen as a one - time - pad booster : starting from a shared seed @xmath2 , a and b end up sharing a sequence of @xmath3 random bits .",
    "no third party is used to establish the key sequences to be used by a and b. no need for intrusion detection exists .",
    "furthermore , all of these elements allow immediate implementation  even commercial ( truly ) random generators exist @xcite for moderate speeds .",
    "one may also argue that some quantum protocols exist that are proven secure as the well known single photon protocol bb84 @xcite to distribute random bit sequences and , therefore , what novelty is being offered ?",
    "single - photon protocols can not be amplified and therefore do not work for the long - haul communications necessary for the internet .",
    "furthermore , signals from single - photon protocols can not be converted from optical to electrical and back to optical without loss of security . nor they are practical for wavelength multiplexing ( wdm ) .",
    "these steps are necessary for the internet .",
    "alternative systems such as those using discrete or continuous variable processes relying on homodyne measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) are very sensitive to noise .",
    "this leads to low key rate transfer and , even more serious , they can not work in the naturally disturbed and complex internet networks . in this sense , direct quantum communication over the internet is not realistic .",
    "on the other hand , some advantages of this nsi are : 1 ) the protocol is established at the user level where the secure data / message is prepared . this message / data is deterministic and noiseless but carries , as it will be shown , truly random information that was generated by a physical process .",
    "the key distribution procedure uses the installed communication network but its protection depends on physical laws instead of mathematical complexities .",
    "2 ) the data is prepared in any convenient form for the underlying osi layers with no need for modification of the ip in use .",
    "a simple binary file can be prepared by a or b to be sent through the osi stack .",
    "these characteristics will not be dependent of security procedures established at the osi s `` presentation '' layer .",
    "normal data manipulation demanded by osi protocols can be applied .",
    "the only and usually expected requirement is that the end user receives the data file as it was delivered by the sender , bit - by - bit .",
    "this presupposes use of error correction protocols to guarantee perfect delivery of the ciphered message to the end user .",
    "the ip protocols in use are then left untouched ; just a private protection layer is added by the users .",
    "this added layer , under user s control , presents no risk in the eventual creation of algorithms for fast factoring of numbers in primes .",
    "also , even creation of a quantum computer or quantum processors does not decrease the physical protection tied to the signals .",
    "there resides the special value of this system and its proposition as a secure layer for users that demand protection based on physical principles .",
    "the central problem is how to distribute over the internet secure sequences of random bits @xmath4 .",
    "this is the main puzzle with a solution presented in this work . before discussing this fundamental problem and the proposed solution",
    ", one may state that if this is true , it is clear that ciphered messages based on one - time - pad could be sent over any physical channel with no need to further obscure the transmission for protection .",
    "the cipher message could even be made public because the protection is guaranteed by the one - time - pad method itself . as another consequence",
    ", no intrusion detection mechanism will be needed .",
    "use of classical carriers to carry recorded quantum information is a normal process that is often not perceived .",
    "scientific journals use this process constantly although they do not require a special protection . understanding quantum phenomena as sets of probable events or different possible quantum trajectories , the classical information obtained from instrumental clicks is nothing more than recording one amongst the many possible quantum trajectories .",
    "repetition of the same measurement operation may lead to a very distinct result ; that is to say , a record of another trajectory among the possible ones .",
    "the files to be sent over the internet are to be obtained in samplings of single events ( bits ) .",
    "the information protection desired relies on the multitude of possible quantum trajectories that generates each single bit of the random sequence .",
    "this is completely different from using pseudo noise generated in a deterministic process ( hardware stream ciphers ) , whose generation mechanism can be searched , discovered and used by the attacker @xcite .",
    "one may easily argue , for example , that phase fluctations on a laser output or in thermal radiation are not quantum .",
    "both can be represented by gaussian random processes .",
    "several definitions ( e.g. glauber s positive @xmath5 representation @xcite or mandel s @xmath6 parameter @xcite ) can be utilized to classify these fluctuations as poissonian or super - poissonian .",
    "light in a coherent state will be at the boundary between the `` classical '' and `` quantum '' realms .",
    "although the question if electromagnetic radiation can be classified as classical or quantum is probably a philosophical question , the importance of the uncontrollable or unpredictable physical fluctuation in both representations is the important aspect to be utilized in this work .",
    "sometimes the expression `` quantum fluctuations '' will be utilized by the author to express fluctuations associated with the light field .",
    "the reader may ignore the `` quantum '' adjective with no harm for ideas presented .",
    "a quantum calculation is often quite adequate to deal with light fluctuations and will be utilized .",
    "this work will discuss the physically built - in properties of these secure files .",
    "it will also explains why one - time - pad keys can be created and shared by a and b through the internet .",
    "this is basically about physics , not a discussion about software or deterministic ( pseudo - random ) stream cipher hardware .",
    "the security is intrinsically connected with fluctuations of the light field . before discussing the information content in this process",
    ", the section [ the distribution protocol ] will describe the basic standard distribution protocol .",
    "after this description , it is explained how the recorded files carry the noise protection .",
    "the deterministic signals going through arbitrary communication channels are encrypted by random signals obtained from optical sources and are described by non - orthogonal @xmath7-ry bases .",
    "distribution of secure data @xcite and key distribution over optical channels using @xmath7-ry bases has been discussed on recent publications @xcite .",
    "the security of the key distribution process described here relies on a few points : 1 ) a shared secrecy by users a and b on a starting key sequence @xmath2 and 2 ) a bit - by - bit uncertainty nature - made noise associated to each bit and recorded on a interleaved @xmath7-ry non - orthogonal bases .    in short , knowledge of @xmath2",
    "gives the legitimate users the first mapping of the bases generated by the emitter and allow b to recover each bit inscribed on every basis used .",
    "sequences of fresh random bits , by its turn , will be generated by a truly random process and sent one - by - one between users a and b. subsequent privacy amplification procedures statistically exclude the eventually compromised fraction of shared bits .",
    "the batch of secure shared secret bits ( distilled bits ) will be used for one - time - pad encryption .",
    "the physical noise from the bit generator protects each bit from the attacker e ( eve ) and provides the information security level associated with all @xmath4 .",
    "the signals associated to the key sequences @xmath4 are created by a physical random generator(phrg ) .",
    "the noise @xmath8 associated with each bit @xmath4 inscribed onto the @xmath7-ry nonorthogonal basis ( @xmath9 ) produces the uncertainty seen by the attacker .",
    "this implies that the emitter has to be equipped to detect and record the signals generated by the phrg . in other words ,",
    "the definition of the measuring system is made by the emitter , not the attacker .",
    "the signal sent is the signal controlled and measured by the emitter with a detection system of his choice .",
    "no restrictions are placed on the attacker to obtain the exchanged signals on a public channel .",
    "perfect copies of the transmission signals can be made public . among the properties of the proposed system",
    "are : 1 ) any public channel may be used for transmission ( optical fibers , tv , microwave , and so on ) ; 2 ) the deterministic signals can be amplified with no security loss ; 3 ) signals can be converted from electromagnetic to electrical and back to electromagnetic with no security loss ; 4 ) wavelength multiplexing is allowed on the network ; 5 ) current network and ip protocols can be used with no modifications for users in any ip classes .",
