    "in many cosmological approaches based on the renormalization - group running of the fundamental quantities such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the fundamental procedure of the underlying quantum ( field ) theory specifies the running of the aforementioned quantities in terms of the appropriate running scale . from the viewpoint of quantum field theory , the running scale has a natural interpretation in the form of the scaling factor of external momenta or the energy cutoff .",
    "the formulation of the consistent cosmological model comprising running quantities requires translation of the running in terms of the running scale to the evolution of these quantities in terms of cosmological variables .",
    "this identification of the running scale with a specific function of cosmological variables is a crucial step in all approaches relying on the rge approach for the dynamics of quantities such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "all efforts that have been undertaken in this direction so far have concentrated on the argumentation in favor of some seemingly `` natural '' choices for the rge scale , without a proper procedure of their derivation .",
    "what is meant by `` natural '' choices is to a great extent a matter of taste and depends strongly on the outcome one wishes to achieve .",
    "thus , one should not be surprised that the literature contains choices for the rg scale which , at present , differ up to 30 orders of magnitude , see , e.g. , refs.[13 , 14 , 16 ] .",
    "needless to say , with different choices for the rg scale one automatically selects different cosmologies , thus making rg approaches devoid of any firm and generic prediction .",
    "in addition to noting that even a phenomenological setting of the rg scale is not an obvious matter in cosmological setups , one also finds for both rg cosmologies discussed in this paper ( for detailed discussions , see the subsequent chapters below ) that the situation with the scale setting is intrinsically not free from ambiguities .",
    "for instance , for the rg evolution in a conventional field - theoretical model in the classical curved background ( see chapter 6 ) , one derives the beta functions from the loop expansion .",
    "the main ambiguity comes from the fact that the beta functions are strongly dependent on the renormalization scheme .",
    "for example , in the ms - scheme the rg shows how the various parameters depend on the rg scale @xmath9 . on the other hand , in the mass - dependent schemes",
    "there is no @xmath9 , and one directly gains the dependence on the external signal ( like the typical energy of interaction ) . aside from the uv limit where both schemes are proved to be equivalent",
    ", this identification fails , especially for massive fields .",
    "as we deal here with vacuum graphs with no external legs , not only the physical sense of @xmath9 becomes more troublesome , but also decoupling of heavy - particle species remains ambiguous in both schemes . in the rg approach in quantum gravity ( see chapters 3 and 4 ) , which is essentially nonperturbative , one is shown how a given observable is related to the ir cutoff in the theory .",
    "hence , the role of @xmath9 is undertaken by the ir cutoff @xmath10 .",
    "the cosmological interpretation of @xmath10 is less ambiguous now because it should approximately match the size of the system ; one can envisage several candidates like the hubble distance , the particle horizon , or the event horizon .",
    "still , the intrinsic interpretation of @xmath10 is still ambiguous as any link to the external signal is missing .    despite the phenomenologically interesting results and more or less strong physical motivation behind some choices for the rge scale",
    ", the fact remains that the rge scale - setting procedure is largely arbitrary .",
    "a naturally arising question is whether some physical argument might remove this apparent arbitrariness and introduce a procedure that would set the rge scale automatically in terms of cosmological variables .",
    "this paper is centered around such a procedure for a broad class of models based on the rge approach .",
    "the class of rge - based cosmological models is characterized by the following properties .",
    "the only running quantities taken into consideration are the cosmological term @xmath11 ( or equivalently the cosmological term energy density @xmath12 ) and the gravitational coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "these running quantities depend on a single running scale , generally denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "other components of the content of the universe ( such as nonrelativistic matter or radiation ) evolve in a standard way , i.e. there is no exchange of energy - momentum between these components and the dynamical cosmological term .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and clarity of exposition , in all considerations put forward in this paper we assume that there exists only one additional matter component described by the equation of state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is constant .",
    "the inclusion of additional matter components and/or more general equations of state is straightforward .",
    "the physical principle behind the scale - setting procedure is conceptually simple .",
    "the rge improved einstein equation for these cosmologies acquires the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the ricci tensor and scalar respectively , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for matter and cosmological term energy - momentum tensors , respectively .",
    "the only physical requirement is that equation ( [ eq : ein ] ) must maintain its general covariance with the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath21 having the @xmath13 ( and implicitly @xmath22 ) dependence .",
    "this requirement translates into the following equation relating @xmath8 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 here dots denote time derivatives . assuming the nonvanishing @xmath26 throughout the evolution of the universe , we arrive at the equation @xmath27 on the left - hand side of the above equation we have a function of the scale factor @xmath28 , while on the right - hand side we have a function of @xmath13 , i.e. we have an expression of the form @xmath29 .",
    "the inversion of this expression in principle gives the scale @xmath13 in terms of @xmath24 in the form @xmath30 . in the cases in which the inversion of the function @xmath31 gives multiple possibilities for the choice of @xmath13",
    ", we assume that one of them can be selected on some physical grounds ( such as the positivity of the scale in the case of @xmath32 ) .",
    "once the procedure of the scale setting is completed , we formally have the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath24 .",
    "the matter energy density has the usual scaling behavior with the scale factor @xmath33 the set of equations necessary for the description of the evolution of the universe is completed by the friedmann equation @xmath34    in the following sections we present several examples of the functioning of the procedure and point out some physically interesting effects in the evolution of the cosmological models based on rge and our scale - setting procedure .    before doing this",
    ", we make some comments on the character of our scale - setting procedure as well as on cases where it is not applicable .",
    "first of all , it is clearly seen that our procedure lacks the first - principle connection to quantum gravity considerations , and therefore should be considered as purely phenomenological .",
    "concerning our basic eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have assumed that @xmath35 is intrinsically independent of @xmath9 .. ] as seen from ( 2 ) , as long as @xmath35 retains its canonical form , the scale is univocally fixed and does not even implicitly depend on @xmath9 in ( 2 ) .",
    "the situation changes when , for instance , an interaction between matter and the cc and/or @xmath8 is turned on . in this case , eq .",
    "( 2 ) generalizes to @xmath36 we see from the above equation for the interacting matter that any deviation from the canonical case ( 4 ) depends decisively on @xmath9 .",
    "hence , one is not able to fix the scale before specifying such interactions _ a priori_. also , the same conclusion is reached for other two extra cases derived from ( 6 ) : ( i ) for the constant @xmath8 and the running @xmath4 , and ( ii ) for the constant ( or zero ) @xmath4 and the running @xmath8 .",
    "thus , one is restricted to the cosmological setup defined by ( 2 ) for the full applicability of our scale - setting procedure .    as a first step in the next section , we shortly review the nonperturbative quantum gravity as derived by reuter et  al . @xcite and apply the scale setting procedure for the running @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the perturbative regime , which interpolates the behavior of @xmath37 and @xmath38 between the uv fixed point and the infrared limit .",
    "in the quantum - gravity approach of @xcite the metric is the fundamental dynamical variable .",
    "it is possible to construct a scale - dependent gravitational action @xmath39 $ ] and derive the appropriate evolution equation .",
    "the properties of the constructed  effective average action \" , especially a built - in infrared cutoff , are welcome in the case of quantum gravity since it is possible to study low - momentum behavior in a nonperturbative way . in such a way",
    ", quantum gravity can be used to describe gravitational phenomena at very large distances .",
    "a systematic study of the application of the exact renormalization - group approach to quantum gravity was done by reuter @xcite .",
    "there appears the effective average action @xmath39 $ ] , which is basically a wilsonian coarse - grained free energy @xcite .",
    "this action depends on metrics and the momentum scale @xmath10 interpreted as an infrared cutoff in the following way .",
    "if one has a physical system with a size @xmath40 , then the mass parameter @xmath41 defines an infrared cutoff .",
    "this is the fundamental step in deriving the average effective action in the wilson - kadanoff formulation of the effective action .",
    "the main difference between the effective average action @xmath42 $ ] and the ordinary effective action @xmath43 $ ] is in the fact that the path integral which defines @xmath44 integrates only the quantum fluctuations with the momenta @xmath45 , thus describing the dynamics of the metrics averaged over the volume with size @xmath46 .",
    "the derived effective field theory is valid near the scale @xmath10 . for any scale @xmath10",
    ", there is an @xmath47 which is an effective field theory at that scale .",
    "this means that all gravitational phenomena are correctly described at tree level by @xmath47 , including the loop effects with @xmath48 .",
    "quantum fluctuations for @xmath45 are integrated out , and large - distance metric fluctuations , @xmath49 , are not included . of course , in the limit",
    "@xmath50 , the infrared cutoff  disappears \" and the original effective action @xmath51 is recovered . on the other hand , the einstein - hilbert action can be interpreted as fundamental theory in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "the determination of the infrared cutoff ( i. e. , the scale @xmath10 ) is by no means trivial in reality .",
    "it is rather simple in a massless theory such as massless qed , where the inverse of a distance is the only mass scale present in the theory .",
    "however , a real situation one encounters is the variety of mass scales and the proper identification , if any , is not trivial at all .",
    "the correct way to proceed would be to study the rg flow of the effective action @xmath42 $ ] and make the identification of the infrared cutoff by inspecting the rg evolution .",
    "once the infrared cutoff is identified , one should solve the bianchi identities and the conservation laws for matter @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can start vice versa , i. e. , use the bianchi identities , etc .",
    ", to fix a scale and look whether it is possible to give a physical interpretation to the scale .",
    "it is clear that there should exist a certain physical mechanism which effectively stops the running in the infrared .",
    "obviously , it is a function of all possible scales that appear in a certain case and/or characterize a physical system under consideration  it may include particle momenta , field strengths , the curvature of spacetime , etc .",
    "however , looking at the global system described by einstein equations , the conditions of homogeneity and isotropy lead to a possible natural choice of @xmath10 to be proportional to the cosmological time @xmath22 , @xmath53 . if the dependence @xmath54 is known , the @xmath38 and @xmath37 become the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the choice @xmath57 seems to be a plausible one .",
    "the cosmological time @xmath22 describes the temporal distance between some event - point @xmath58 and the big - bang . for the effective field theory @xmath47 to be valid at @xmath22 , one need not integrate quantum fluctuations with momenta smaller than @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "namely , at the time @xmath22 , the fluctuations with frequencies smaller than @xmath61 should not play any role yet , and the meaning of the infrared cutoff becomes obvious .",
    "nonperturbative solutions of the rg equations are obtained by truncation of the original infinite dimensional space of all action functionals to some specific finite dimensional space which appears relevant to a given physical problem .",
    "the usual truncation is the reduction to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this ansatz leads to the coupled system @xcite of equations for @xmath38 and @xmath37 . for the case @xmath62 , it is simple and easy to solve .",
    "it leads to two attractive fixed points @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the ultraviolet ( non - gaussian ) fixed point is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number which is calculated , and an infrared ( gaussian ) fixed point at @xmath67 .",
    "all trajectories which are attracted towards @xmath67 for @xmath68 and towards @xmath69 for @xmath52 lead to the following form of @xmath70 : @xmath71 which for small @xmath10 reads @xmath72 since for the einstein - hilbert truncation @xmath38 does not run between the scale where it is experimentally determined to be the newton constant @xmath73 , and a cosmological scale for which @xmath74 , @xmath75 can be safely identified as @xmath76 .    for @xmath77 ,",
    "the fixed - point behavior sets in and @xmath38 becomes @xmath78 in accordance with the asymptotic running predicted by polyakov @xcite .",

    ", the assumption of the existence of the ir fixed point in the rge flow @xcite is of special interest ( for related work see also @xcite ) .    in this setting , the infrared cutoff @xmath10 plays the role of the general rge scale @xmath13 . in the infrared limit",

    "one may , however , argue that there exists a certain level of implicit dependence since the expansion of the universe ( and therefore the dependence of @xmath24 on time ) depends on @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the scale - setting procedure of this paper unambiguously identifies the scale @xmath10 in the model of quantum gravity with the ir fixed point .",
    "the result ( [ eq : irset ] ) leads to the following general result : @xmath91    combining the expressions ( [ eq : scalmatt ] ) , ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) and ( [ eq : lamrelg ] ) allows the dependence of the scale factor on time .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the choice @xmath118 is adequate for the flat universe , while for the curved one the scale may differ from the @xmath119 .",
    "it is important to stress here that persisting with the @xmath120 identification ( as done in @xcite ) may lead to misleading conclusions about consistency of the cosmological solutions to the system of the equations as given by ( [ eq : evol ] ) , ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) , ( [ eq : lamir ] ) and ( [ eq : gir ] ) .",
    "the observation in @xcite was that consistent solutions to the above system ( with @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) exist only for a radiation dominated universe ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the final conclusion in @xcite actuated by this observation was that our universe could fall into the basin of attraction induced by the ir fixed point only if it is spatially flat ( @xmath124 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "our scale - setting procedure shows that consistent solutions to the above system can be obtained for a universe having arbitrary curvature and for the matter equation of state with arbitrary @xmath15 .",
    "the preceding paragraphs demonstrate how our scale - setting procedure leads to the mathematically consistent choice for the scale @xmath10 for any geometry or the matter content of the universe .",
    "once the specification of the scale @xmath10 is available , one can consider its physical interpretation .",
    "the formulation of the underlying formalism , which leads to the rge equations for @xmath11 and @xmath8 , may generally put some constraints on the physically acceptable choices for the scale @xmath10 .",
    "one such constraint is that this scale should have a geometrical interpretation @xcite .",
    "this requirement is of qualitative nature and still allows for many geometrically motivated choices for @xmath10 @xcite . in finding the solution of the dynamics of the universe , one ,",
    "therefore , has to obtain a solution for @xmath10 with an acceptable geometrical interpretation which at the same time satisfies bianchi identity .",
    "one possible approach is first to choose an _ ansatz _ for @xmath10 in such a way that it has a proper geometrical interpretation .",
    "then , in the second step , one checks whether the set of equations describing the cosmology has a mathematically consistent solution . in the case of the mathematical inconsistency",
    "one should either discard the universe with a given geometry and the matter content as unphysical ( should one decide to insist on the ansatz ) or try with some other suitable choice for @xmath10 . it is conceivable that in some cases of physical interest one might exhaust the list of obvious anstze without finding the one which would lead to a mathematically consistent set of cosmological equations .",
    "such an outcome certainly would not imply that the appropriate choice for @xmath10 does not exist for a given geometry or the matter content , but that some nontrivial choice might exist which still has a satisfactory geometrical interpretation . a different approach is based on the scale - setting procedure introduced in this paper .",
    "the scale - setting procedure always yields a mathematically consistent solution for @xmath10 .",
    "given this solution , it can be further examined to test whether it meets the physical requirements .",
    "this procedure is _ systematic _ and allows treatment of any geometry or the matter content of the universe .",
    "for example , from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] one can see that for the universe with a small curvature the scale @xmath10 obtained by our scale - setting procedure is reasonably close ( at times when the ir fixed point is supposed to dominate ) to the scale obtained for the flat case and it still has a satisfactory geometrical interpretation . in this way the models with small , but nonvanishing curvatures are physically acceptable as a possible description of the universe within the rge framework discussed in this section .",
    "this conclusion is expected since the consistency of the model for the flat space and inconsistency for the arbitrarily small @xmath125 would represent a certain discontinuity and would be very surprising .",
    "an interesting extension of the example given in the preceding section is the study of a more general running of @xmath11 and @xmath8 in the infrared region .",
    "namely , it is interesting to consider the running in the form @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are positive constants .",

    "gravity , with quantum corrections being small up to the very high planck scale , appears to be , _ prima facie _ , an even better effective field theory , which is expected to govern the effects of quantum gravity at low - energy scale without the knowledge of the true quantum gravity .",
    "however , the reality is not so simple , since the possible existence of the singularity in the future , corresponding to the wavelength probed of the order of the size of the universe - deeply in the infrared region - may break the validity of the effective theory in the infrared limit . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was shown @xcite that quantum gravity may lead to the very strong renormalization effects at large distances induced by infrared divergences . in the following discussions we assume the validity of the effective theory at present time and present scales persists in the infrared region .",

    "it is , for example , well known @xcite that , in nonperturbative quantum gravity , the g runs to the infinity in the infrared limit , which is an artifact of the einstein - hilbert truncation , i. e. , the absence of high derivative terms .",

    ".    the physical interpretation of the rg scale in the high derivative sector can be achieved calculating @xcite the polarization operator of gravitons arising from the particle loops in the linearized gravity . in the rg equation which contains the derivative with respect to the arbitray renormalization parameter @xmath13 , one usually eliminates the @xmath13 parameter trading it for a euclidean momentum @xmath144 . in the physical mass - dependent renormalization scheme ( e. g. momentum subtraction scheme )",
    "@xmath13 is traded for a certain euclidean momentum @xmath144 . in qcd , for example ,",

    "the application of the scale - setting procedure yields the expression @xmath150 which finally leads to the identification of the scale @xmath13 @xmath151    we can cast more light on this general expression by more precisely specifying the values of the coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath153 . from the studies of the cosmologies with the running @xmath7 in the formalism of quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite , we know that generally @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , etc . here",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath158 denote the largest and the smallest masses of ( massive ) fields in the theory , respectively , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 stand for the number of bosonic and fermionic massive degrees of freedom in the theory , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath161 does not follow from the argumentation of the same type , but its value could hardly surpass @xmath162 . adopting the same line of reasoning for @xmath8 , on dimensional grounds , we expect @xmath163 , @xmath164 , etc . for the value of @xmath165",
    "it is natural to take @xmath166 .",
    "any other choice would imply a very strong running for @xmath8 which would not be consistent with the observational data on @xmath8 variation @xcite . taking these values of the coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    ", we obtain the following expression for the scale @xmath13 : @xmath167 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath168 and @xmath169 represent constants of order 1 .",
    "this result for the rge scale implies a very slow running of the scale @xmath13 in the vicinity of @xmath170 .",
    "this value of the scale is also only marginally acceptable as far as the convergence of the expansions ( [ eq : lamexp ] ) and ( [ eq : gexp ] ) is concerned .",
    "furthermore , when the solution ( [ eq : muconcrete ] ) is inserted into ( [ eq : lamexp ] ) , one arrives at @xmath171 . if for @xmath158 one takes the mass scale revealed in recent neutrino oscillation experiments , of order @xmath172 , one obtains @xmath173 , which is obviously far too large for any @xmath157 . in the extreme case , we can set @xmath174 and saturate @xmath173 with @xmath175 .",
    "let us , however , recall that from the beginning of our presentation we have proclaimed quintessence degrees of freedom as redundant ones in the present approach .",
    "although some intermediate scale for @xmath157 and @xmath158 are also possible , we do not consider this case a plausible one .    in the model put forward in @xcite ,",
    "it is pointed out that some amount of fine - tuning needs to be introduced into the expansion ( [ eq : lamexp ] ) in order to maintain the consistency with the results of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "this fine - tuning is realized by the requirement @xmath176 .",
    "if we adopt this constraint , the solution for @xmath177 becomes @xmath178 which at the present epoch of the evolution of the universe is quite well approximated by @xmath179 , a choice advocated in @xcite .",
    "however , this value of the scale leads to an extremely slow variation of @xmath7 with the leading term in the scale @xmath13 of the type @xmath180 .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath181 leads to the too strong running , while the fine - tuned value @xmath182 leads to the negligible running .",
    "it is natural to ask whether some intermediate value for @xmath183 might lead to a satisfactory running scheme . assuming that @xmath183 has the value around @xmath158 , the natural value of the scale becomes @xmath184 here @xmath185 and @xmath186 refer to dimensionless constants of the order 1 .",
    "this value of the scale @xmath13 can approximately reproduce the present value of the cosmological term energy density @xmath187 even with the assumption @xmath188 . from ( [ eq : c1mmin ] ) it is also evident that the scale changes very slowly .",
    "another problem is the issue of convergence of the series ( [ eq : lamexp ] ) and ( [ eq : gexp ] ) .",
    "however , as the ratio @xmath189 is at present time ( and also during the matter - dominated era ) proportional to @xmath190 , with this choice of @xmath183 , we effectively reproduce the evolution of the models elaborated in @xcite where the variability of the @xmath7 is described with the @xmath190 term . it is interesting to note that if one allows the violation of the decoupling theorem for @xmath191 , it is possible to obtain a rge based cosmology , consistent with our scale - setting procedure , in which @xmath192 and @xmath7 varies with @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the general discussion given in this section indicates that the application of the scale - setting procedure to the rge cosmology determined by ( [ eq : lamexp ] ) and ( [ eq : gexp ] ) yields results at variance with observational bounds for the values of the coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath153 determined on dimesional grounds only . to achieve the consistency of the model with the observational results , it is necessary to impose restrictions on some of these coefficients . the mechanism behind these restrictions , however , still remains to be clarified .",
    "the procedure of the scale setting in rge - based cosmologies presented in this paper translates well - founded models of quantum theories to unambiguously defined cosmological models . the underlying argument behind the entire procedure ,",
    "the maintaining of general covariance at the level of the einstein equation , is conceptually simple and theoretically convincing .",
    "the details and the origin of the rge for @xmath8 and @xmath7 are immaterial for the functioning of the procedure , which is , in this respect , quite robust . in several examples given in this paper , the applicability of the procedure was demonstrated in two cases with rge of quite different backgrounds : quantum gravity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime . in both cases ,",
    "the scale - setting procedure provides insight beyond the phenomenologically motivated choices for the rge running scale . with the availability of this scale - setting procedure",
    ", emphasis is now put on the more precise formulation of rge for the cosmologically relevant quantities in the underlying fundamental theories .",

    "<S> hence , contrary to the procedures employed in the recent literature , we argue that there is no more freedom in identification of the rg scale in terms of the cosmic time in such cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully set the rg scale for the rg evolution phrased in a quantum gravity framework based on the hypothetical existence of an infrared ( ir ) fixed point , for the perturbative regime within the same framework , as well as for an evolution within quantum field theory ( qft ) in a curved background . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the implications of the scale setting for the particle spectrum are also briefly discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , indisputable evidence has been mounting to suggest that the expansion of our universe is accelerating owing to the nonvanishing value of unclustered dark energy with negative pressure , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial evidence for the existence of dark energy [ or the cosmological constant ( cc ) ] relies on the cmb observations @xcite which strongly support a spatially flat universe as predicted by inflationary models . by combinations of all data </S>",
    "<S> a current picture of the universe emerges , in which about 2/3 of the critical energy density of the present universe is made up by a background dark energy with the parameter of the equation of state @xmath0 at @xmath1 confidence level @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> have been aimed at dealing with the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> still , a quintessence potential has to be fine - tuned to yield the present ratio of ordinary matter to quintessence energy density , at the same time allowing a phase dominated by matter so that structure can form ; therefore these models can not address the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , such models may have difficulties in achieving the current quintessence equation of state with its parameter below -0.8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although extended models with spatially homogeneous light scalar fields based on a nonlinear kinetic energy ( k - essence ) @xcite have been put forward , it seems that today a trustworthy solution to the coincidence problem , beyond invoking an anthropic principle @xcite , is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> recently , motivated by the observational data , models of dark energy with the supernegative equation of state ( @xmath3 ) have been introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this form of dark energy , named phantom energy , leads to many interesting phenomena , the most striking being the possibility of divergence of the scale factor in finite time , the so - called  big rip \" effect @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another class of variable dark - energy models which could successfully mimic quintessence models and may also shed some light on the coincidence problem , have been put forward recently . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on the observation @xcite that even a  true \" cc ( with the equation of state being precisely -1 ) can not be fixed to any definite constant ( including zero ) owing to the renormalization - group ( rg ) running effects . in @xcite , the variation of the cc arises solely from particle field fluctuations , without introducing any quintessence - like scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> particle contributions to the rg running of @xmath4 due to vacuum fluctuations of massive fields have been properly derived in @xcite , with a somewhat unexpected outcome that more massive fields do play a dominant role in the running at any scale . in the model @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the rg running is due to non - perturbative quantum gravity effects and the hypothesis of the existence of an ir attractive rg fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> both models @xcite also promote the gravitational constant to a rg running quantity , with a prominent scaling behavior found in @xcite . in both models </S>",
    "<S> the presence of quintessence - like scalar fields is redundant and not required for consistency with observational data .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in the above rg running models the amount of running will depend not only on the parameters of an underlying physical theory , but also on the characteristic rg scale , which must be correctly identified . </S>",
    "<S> several different scenarios for rg - scale adoption have been contemplated in the literature . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the rg scale was identified with the hubble parameter , which for the present time is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to extremely slow running of the cc and the gravitational constant . </S>",
    "<S> another choice , given by the fourth root of the total energy density @xcite , produces much faster running of the cc . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of such a choice is that it entails a direct association with particle momenta ( and therefore with the temperature of interacting particle species ) in the past radiation epoch .    in the models @xcite the rg scale ( cutoff ) </S>",
    "<S> was identified with the inverse of the cosmological time , which is essentially equivalent to the previous case of the hubble parameter for cosmologies with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> another choice for the relevant cutoff with the implicit time dependence in the form of the inverse scale factor was also analyzed @xcite . with the above choices </S>",
    "<S> , it was found that no consistent solution existed in the former case for curved universes ( aside for the radiation - dominated era ) and even for flat universes in the latter case . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the consistency relation as dictated by the bianchi identity , which relates the time dependencies of the cc , the gravitational constant and the ordinary matter density , does unambiguously set the rg scale once the rg solutions are known </S>",
    "<S> . hence , any conclusion about the consistency of cosmological solutions with an arbitrary choice of the rg scale may be quite misleading . </S>",
    "<S> our scale - setting procedure works well for both flat and curved universes as well as for the matter background with an arbitrary equation of state . we note that if the ordinary energy - momentum tensor is not separately conserved ( for instance , owing to the interaction between matter and the cc , which causes a transfer of energy from matter to the cc or vice versa ) , </S>",
    "<S> then the consistency relation becomes more complicated and the scale - setting procedure is no longer straightforward . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we explain the scale - setting procedure in detail and apply it to several relevant rg solutions obtained in quantum gravity and in qft in a curved background . </S>"
