    "numerous observations of waves in the the earth magnetosheath , as well as at other planets have stimulated studies of longwavelength and low - frequency modes in high @xmath1 magnetized plasmas .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that the features of low - frequency waves in hot plasmas differ significantly from those in cool plasmas , even in the limit corresponding to the usual magnetohydrodynamic waves @xcite .",
    "these findings have been subsequently proven by direct comparison with observations @xcite . however , particular interest to the low - frequency modes in hot plasmas is explained by observations of the mirror modes , which were found in planetary magnetosheaths @xcite , in the solar wind @xcite , in cometary comas @xcite , and in the wake of io @xcite .",
    "these modes are nonpropagating zero frequency modes ( sometimes considered as the kinetic counterpart of the hydrodynamical entropy mode ) , which are expected to grow in an anisotropic plasma with sufficiently high @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "usual high amplitudes of observed mirror modes show that they easily achieve the nonlinear regime . at the same time , in several cases low - amplitude magnetic field structures with the same properties were observed which may mean that the linear and nonlinear mirror mode features are generically related .",
    "yet we do not know so far what makes these modes so ubiquitous and what determines their nonlinear amplitudes .",
    "the early explanation of the mirror instability @xcite is based on the simple picture of the adiabatic response of the anisotropic pressure of magnetized particles .",
    "numerical analyses of the mirror instability in bi - maxwellian plasmas @xcite have shown that the maximum of the growth rate occurs at @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the ion thermal gyroradius ) , which was interpreted as an indication on the kinetic nature of the instability .    at the same time",
    ", @xcite proposed a new explanation of the instability mechanism as a resonant one , where the presence of a group of the resonant particles ( with @xmath5 ) plays the _ destructive _ role in the mode excitation : the growth rate of the instability is claimed to be inversely proportional to the number of the resonant particles .",
    "this explanation was further reiterated with some modifications by @xcite and @xcite , and used by @xcite for the explanation of the nonlinear saturation mechanism .",
    "the analysis of @xcite is done in the regime where the phase velocity of the perturbation is much less than the parallel thermal velocity , in other words , @xmath6 , and therefore , is directly applied only at the very threshold of the instability . at the same time , numerical calculations @xcite show that most important events occur in the range @xmath7 , which is not covered in the previous analytical studies .",
    "the previous analytical and numerical considerations of the linear regime of the mirror instability , even in the longwavelength limit , are , as a rule , restricted to the usage of the bi - maxwellian distribution . at the same time",
    "particle distributions in collisionless plasma may substantially differ from the maxwellian .",
    "for example , due to the ion heating mechanism at the shock ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the magnetosheath ion distributions may well deviate from the bi - maxwellian .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study the dependence of the instability on the shape of the ion and electron distributions .",
    "yet another argument in favor of the analysis of other distributionsf is that there is no good analytical approximations for the dielectric tensor for the maxwellian plasma in the range @xmath8 , which forced researchers to consider more convenient asymptotics .",
    "it is , however , possible to find the shapes of the distribution which allow closed analytical presentation of the dielectric tensor in the whole range of phase velocities and make the study of the instability physics more transparent .    in the present paper we study in detail the dependence of the mirror instability on the shape of the ion and electron distributions , using model distribution functions which allow direct explicit analytical calculation of the dielectric tensor .",
    "we establish the generic relation of the mirror instability with the oscillatory modes when the landau damping is absent and study the transition of damping modes to the unstable regime .",
    "we also propose an approximation which is useful for the analytical treatment of the instability in the most important range @xmath7 in general case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ] we derive the general dispersion relation in the longwavelength for arbitrary distribution function . in sections  [ sec :",
    "waterbag]-[sec : hardbell ] we apply the general analysis to three different distributions . in section  [ sec : threshold ]",
    "we derive the instability condition and the growth rate at the threshold for arbitrary distribution . in section  [ sec : bimax ] we develop a useful approximation for the analysis of the bi - maxwellian - kind distributions in the region of the maximum growth rate .",
    "in what follows we will be interested in the longwavelength limit where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while maintaining the phase velocity finite @xmath11 .",
    "the last inequality means that the phase velocity does not tend to zero in all propagation angle range but it certainly may vanish for particular set of parameters . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both ions and electrons are maxwellian in the perpendicular direction , so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we also denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 for each species ( subscript @xmath16 stands for ions and subscript @xmath17 for electrons ) .",
    "let us introduce the refraction index vector @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 .",
    "with all this the components of the dispersion matrix @xmath20 take the following form ( see appendix  [ sec : long ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the integration in is taken along the path below the singularity @xmath27 . in what follows",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath28 and neglect unity relative to this large parameter ( which corresponds to the assumption @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the alfven velocity ) .",
    "in what follows we also neglect @xmath31 . in the above derivation we used @xmath32 in the quasineutral electron proton plasma ( this is not correct if any admixture of other charged particles is present ) .    in the limit @xmath33(and @xmath34 finite ) the dispersion relation @xmath35",
    "splits into two ones .",
    "one describes the purely transverse alfven wave ( the wave electric field vector in the @xmath36 plane , the wave magnetic field vector perpendicular to the external magnetic field ) with the dispersion @xmath37 in this wave the absolute value of the magnetic field does not change , but the magnetic field rotates .",
    "the second dispersion relation reads @xmath38 \\left [ \\frac{\\bar{\\chi}_i}{\\beta_{i\\parallel } } +   \\frac{\\bar{\\chi}_e}{\\beta_{e\\parallel}}\\right ] + \\sin^2\\theta\\left[r_i \\bar{\\chi}_i - r_e\\bar{\\chi}_e\\right]^2=0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we introduced @xmath39 for convenience ( @xmath40 is complex , in general , so that @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "eq .   describes elliptically polarized waves with all three components of the wave electric field present , so that in general there exists a nonzero component of the wave magnetic field @xmath43 in the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "these waves not only rotate the magnetic field but change its magnitude as well .    the functions @xmath44 play the crucial role in the subsequent analysis .",
    "they are defined by the integral containing the distribution function @xmath45 and can not be explicitly calculated without particular choice of these distributions .",
    "it is common to choose @xmath46 as maxwellian . in this case",
    "@xmath44 is well - known and tabulated but has good asymptotic expansions only for @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( for electrons @xmath49 should be substituted by @xmath50 ) .",
    "this actually restricts possible analytical considerations of the mirror instability only with the range @xmath47 . yet , numerical analyses show that the most important events occur in the vicinity of @xmath51 which is unavailable to direct theoretical analysis when maxwellian is chosen .",
    "on the other hand , there are vague indications that the qualitative features of long waves ( instabilities ) in the high @xmath1 more or less sensibly depend on the lowest moments of the distribution function ( provided it is sufficiently `` normal '' : smooth , no beams , no holes , etc . ) .",
    "it therefore makes sense to investigate the dispersion relations for a suitably chosen model distribution so that @xmath44 can be calculated and analyzed in the range @xmath51 . in",
    "what follows we shall use three different distributions for these purposes .",
    "the waterbag distribution @xmath52 will be used for study of the behavior of longwavelength modes and their dependence on the plasma parameters in the absence of landau damping . here",
    "@xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "the hard - bell distribution @xmath57 will allow to include the landau damping effects , and the lorentz - like distribution @xmath58 removes the upper limit on the particle velocities .",
    "the four distributions ( including maxwellian @xmath59 ) mentioned in this paper are shown in figure  [ fig : functions ] .",
    "the waterbag distribution @xmath52 is somewhat peculiar since the landau damping is absent .",
    "the analysis of this distribution allows to establish the generic relation of the instability to nondamping propagating modes .",
    "it is easy to find that in this case @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . in the limit @xmath64",
    "one has @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth noting that for the maxwellian distribution @xmath66 . in this section",
    "we use for electrons the approximation of the massless bi - maxwellian ( instead of above waterbag , which is used only for ions ) , for which @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is a third order equation with respect to @xmath68 with real coefficients .",
    "although this equation can be analyzed directly and even solved analytically , graphical representation of the roots is much more convenient .",
    "figure  [ fig : waterbag01f ] shows the mode with the highest phase velocity ( fast mode ) for the case when @xmath69 and massless bi - maxwellian electrons .",
    "it it worth noting that ions are _ not _ isotropic since they are maxwellian in the perpendicular direction and waterbag in the parallel direction .",
    "the phase velocity of the fast mode is well above @xmath70 so that it has nothing to do with the mirror instability .",
    "we do not consider this mode in the rest of the paper .",
    "we do not consider the alfven mode either .",
    "the remaining two low - phase velocity modes are shown in figure  [ fig : waterbag01low ] together with @xmath71 ( solid line ) .",
    "the upper curve is above the resonant region having @xmath72 for all ions .",
    "the lower mode is inside the resonant region and would damp if there were nonzero @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ fig : waterbag05low ] shows the same two modes but in the case @xmath74 . in both cases the naive instability condition @xmath75 is not fulfilled , although in the second case @xmath76 is closer to the threshold just because of the larger @xmath77 .",
    "there is no much difference in the behavior of the two modes for these two cases , except a little stronger decrease of the phase velocities towards the perpendicular propagation regime in the higher @xmath77 case .",
    "figure  [ fig : waterbag15em ] shows the behavior of the two modes in the anisotropic case @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( so that @xmath80 ) , and bi - maxwellian electrons . the lower mode now remains purely propagating mode for smaller angles ( diamonds ) but turns into an aperiodic instability for larger angles of propagation ( stars ) . the obvious conclusion from figure  [ fig : waterbag15em ]",
    "is that the unstable mode has its propagation counterpart for the smaller angles of propagation .",
    "the relative growth rate @xmath81 is large in the whole range of instability , so that the approximation @xmath82 @xcite is not applicable .",
    "it is of interest to compare this case with the massless waterbag electrons @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding curves in figure  [ fig : waterbag15ew ] show that there is no instability in this case despite the fact that the threshold is exceeded .",
    "thus , the analysis of the waterbag distribution already shows that ( a ) there is , in general , the propagating counterpart of the mirror instability if landau damping is absent , ( b ) the instability threshold and growth rate are sensitive to the details of the distribution and not only to the second moment , and ( c ) the instability is aperiodic , that is , in the unstable range @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it can be shown that the last feature is generally valid unless the distribution function is very peculiar ( see appendix  [ sec : aperiodic ] ) .",
    "the waterbag distribution does not allow landau damping since @xmath86 everywhere . in order",
    "to get rid of this restriction we consider the hard - bell distribution @xmath57 , which has nonzero derivative but is is compact ( @xmath87 for @xmath88 . in this case",
    "@xmath89 ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 being real , @xmath85 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath94 is obtained from by substitution @xmath95 .    in order to analyze non - compact distributions",
    "too we shall consider the lorentz distribution @xmath58 . in this case",
    "@xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "again , @xmath94 is obtained by substitution @xmath95 .",
    "we shall also compare the results for these distributions with the bi - maxwellian . in this case",
    "there is no compact analytical expression for @xmath99 and we use direct numerical calculation .    in what follows we are interested only in the unstable region .",
    "the subparticle mode is expected to be strongly damped in the propagation range .",
    "the `` superparticle '' mode is not damped in the hard - bell case and almost not damped in the lorentz case .    as the first set of parameters for the unstable regime we choose @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and massless bi - maxwellian electrons @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : four15em ] shows the growth rates for the three distributions .",
    "the highest growth rate is for the lorentzian , the lowest is for the waterbag .",
    "figure  [ fig : fourg1 ] shows the same growth rates as in figure  [ fig : four15em ] but normalized on @xmath100 which allows to compare growth rates of the modes with the same wavenumber @xmath101 and different angles of propagation .",
    "it is seen that the maximum growth rates is achieved approximately at the same angle of propagation @xmath102 for all distributions , but the threshold angle moves towards more quasiparallel regimes for distributions with stronger tails ( maxwellian and lorentzian ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wai125 ] shows the dependence of the growth rate on @xmath77 when @xmath80 and @xmath103 remain constant .",
    "both curves correspond to the waterbag ions and massless bi - maxwellian electrons .",
    "diamonds stand for the same parameters as in figure  [ fig : waterbag15em ] , crosses correspond to @xmath104 and @xmath105 . the instability is stronger for higher @xmath77 .    in the previous analysis we always used the approximation of massless bi - maxwellian distribution corresponding to @xmath106",
    ". figures  [ fig : threeown ] and  [ fig : threeg1own ] show the growth rate of the instability when the electron distributions are chosen in the same form as the ion distributions .",
    "one can see that the waterbag distributions become stable , while the growth rate in the case of lorentzian drastically increases .",
    "the ratio of the maximum growth rates shown in figures  [ fig : fourg1 ] and  [ fig : threeg1own ] roughly corresponds to @xmath107 which shows that the maximum growth rate significantly on electrons ( see sections  [ sec : threshold ] and  [ sec : bimax ] )",
    ".    for other combinations of ion and electron distributions the ratios may be even greater as is seen in figure  [ fig : waimaeloe ] , where diamonds correspond to waterbag ions and massless bi - maxwellian electrons , while circles correspond to waterbag ions and lorentz electrons .",

    "we can neglect completely the electron contribution by putting @xmath121 , which gives the instability criterion in the form @xmath122 and for the bi - maxwellian distribution , @xmath66 , reduces to the naive mirror instability criterion .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath123 and @xmath124 , one gets @xmath125 this condition is harder for more compact distributions ( @xmath126 for waterbag and @xmath127 for hard - bell ) and softer for distributions with long tails ( @xmath66 for maxwellian and @xmath98 for lorentzian ) .",
    "the global instability condition can be written in a more symmetric form as follows : @xmath128 which emphasizes the symmetric role of ions and electrons in the instability onset ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    indeed , near the threshold @xmath129 and the response of both electrons and ions is adiabatic , that is , their inertia does not play any role . in these circumstances",
    "the mass of the particle is of not importance .",
    "their role in the response to the parallel electric field is , however , antisymmetric because of the different signs of the charge : the adiabatic response is obtained from @xmath130 .",
    "the parallel response plays the crucial role in the instability development .",
    "as is known the instability occurs because of the breakdown of the local frozen - in condition and efficient drag of particles out of the field enhancement into the field depletion region @xcite .",
    "thus , when the magnetic field is perturbed , @xmath131 , the perturbation of the density of the species @xmath132 is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is due to the motion along the field lines .",
    "in the adiabatic regime @xmath135 this change can be considered as a quasistatic response to the effective potential @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the electrostatic potential , @xmath138 is the average magnetic moment , and @xmath139 is the charge of the species .",
    "the density response to this effective potential can be found from the reduced vlasov equation @xmath140 which for @xmath141 and @xmath142 gives @xmath143 it is easy to see that in the adiabatic regime near the threshold of the instability , @xmath144 , this expression reduces to the following @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the debye length calculated with the parallel distribution function .",

    ".   shows that smaller debye lengths @xmath146 ( larger @xmath152 ) result in the stronger drag of the particles into the weak field region , that reducing the kinetic pressure response to the magnetic field enhancement and supporting instability .",
    "therefore , stronger debye screening ( larger @xmath152 ) would lower the instability threshold , in agreement with the found from rigorous calculations .",
    "from  it is easily seen that the growth rate is inversely proportional to @xmath153 , and not to the number of particles with @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "the latter is correct for the bi - maxwellian distribution since @xmath154 in this case . for other distributions",
    "this relation may well be wrong .",
    "for example , for the waterbag distribution @xmath155 and higher order terms should be retained to investigate the behavior near the threshold .",
    "it is easy to see from   that in this case @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is well - defined .",
    "the dispersion relation   becomes than a first order equation for @xmath158 , which has one positive solution near the threshold .",
    "it is clear that in this case the growth rate is determined by the whole distribution and not only by the behavior in @xmath5 .",
    "the previous analysis shows that maximum @xmath49 is always of the order of unity or larger , which means that ions no longer respond adiabatically to the magnetic field enhancements and their inertia begins to play an important role .",
    "this also means that it is thermal particles of the ion distribution body with @xmath159 which are mainly responsible for the instability development and not the group of resonant particles with @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : threeown ] shows that for some distributions the instability may be very fast so that the electron inertia should be taken into account .",
    "the previous analysis gives a clue to the treatment of the instability in the range of maximum growth rates , where @xmath160 .",
    "let us assume that the distribution function is such that @xmath161 has a sharp maximum at some @xmath162 .",
    "an example of a distribution of this kind is the maxwellian @xmath163 for which there was no good approximation for @xmath44 in the range @xmath51 so far . for the aperiodic mirror instability with @xmath164 , @xmath85 ,",
    "one has @xmath165 for @xmath166 ( @xmath167 is normalized on @xmath168 ) the function @xmath169 varies slowly in the vicinity of the maximum of @xmath170 , so that one may approximate @xmath171 figure  [ fig : compchi ] shows the comparison of the numerically found @xmath44 for the maxwellian distribution ( @xmath172 ) and @xmath173 with the approximation .",
    "the approximation proves to be very good for @xmath174 and is only by the factor 2 smaller at @xmath175 .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp1chi ] shows similar comparison for lorentzian .",
    "now the maximum growth rate can be obtained by substituting @xmath176 in . if @xmath91 is expected to be high , so that @xmath177 , as it occurs for the lorentzian @xmath178 distributions in figure  [ fig : threeown ] , the electron inertia should be also taken into account by substituting @xmath179 .",
    "if , however , the growth rates are relatively modest ( as in other cases studied in the present paper ) , the electrons still respond adiabatically and @xmath180 . in the last case",
    "turns into a third order equation with respect to @xmath158 .",
    "finding the maximum growth rate from this equation is a technical problem .",
    "we shall stop for a while at the physical sense of the above approximation .",
    "the dependence of the maximum growth rate on @xmath167 indicates that the particles with high velocities @xmath181 are taking part in the process .",
    "this is related to the dynamic redistribution ( closely related to the dynamic debye screening ) : if the potential changes quickly the low velocity particles do not have enough time to change their position and leave the field enhancements .",
    "this redistribution is described by the same eq .",
    "but now @xmath182 .",
    "high velocity particles can leave these regions and reduce the kinetic pressure response but their contribution rapidly decreases with the velocity since their number decreases .",
    "the increase of redistribution efficiency and the decrease of the number of screeners with the velocity increase finds its manifestation in that the main contribution belongs to the particles at the maximum of @xmath161 .",
    "since the redistribution plays the destabilizing role , it can be expected that the smaller is @xmath167 the higher is the growth rate .",
    "this can be seen already from figure  [ fig : fourg1 ] where the growth rate for lorentzian ions , @xmath183 , is larger than the growth rate for the maxwellian , @xmath172 ( with the same massless maxwellian electrons ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vapprox ] shows the comparison of the growth rates obtained with the proposed approximation for several @xmath172 ( diamonds ) , 1.5 ( crosses ) , 1 ( triangles ) , 0.5 ( circles ) , and massless maxwellian electrons .",
    "the parameters chosen are @xmath79 , @xmath184 . as expected the decrease of @xmath167 results in the increase of the maximum growth rate .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : vapproxcomp ] shows the comparison of the growth rates obtained directly and with the above approximation for maxwellian ( diamonds and crosses ) and lorentzian ( triangles and circles ) , for the same parameter set .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "we have derived the most general dispersion relation for longwavelength modes in hot plasmas .",
    "we have derived the general mirror instability condition for arbitrary ion and electron distributions and growth rate of the instability near the threshold .",
    "the instability threshold depends not only on the plasma species @xmath1 but also on another integral characteristic of the distribution function @xmath185 for both species .",
    "larger @xmath152 corresponds to smaller debye length .",
    "smaller debye length , in turn , corresponds to stronger response of the density to the perturbations of the potential , which allows stronger density depletions in the regions of the magnetic field enhancements .",
    "therefore , the kinetic pressure response to the magnetic pressure buildup weakens .",
    "hence , the larger is @xmath152 the lower is instability threshold .",
    "the near - the - threshold growth rate is inversely proportional to @xmath186 , where @xmath111 is the parallel energy .",
    "the mirror instability is always aperiodic and @xmath187 ( and sometimes substantially greater ) .",
    "maximum growth rates are normally determined by @xmath188 such that @xmath189 has a sharp maximum in @xmath190 , and @xmath191 ( if the instability is very strong @xmath192 takes the place of @xmath191 ) .",
    "this is related to the dynamic redistribution in which the thermal particles participate .",
    "growth rates are higher for distributions with tails and lower for compact distributions ( those , for which @xmath87 if @xmath88 , where @xmath193 is some upper limit ) . for noncompact distributions the maximum growth rate is larger for smaller @xmath167 , which corresponds to the weaker dynamic screening of the parallel electric field . for the distributions",
    "analyzed in this paper the behavior of @xmath152 and @xmath167 correlates ( @xmath152 increases when @xmath167 decreases ) since all these are single - parameter distributions . for more general distributions",
    "the behavior of @xmath191 and @xmath167 may be uncorrelated .",
    "it is also worth noting that it not , in general , any specific group of particles which are responsible for the instability development .",
    "compare , for example , two similar distributions ( velocity normalized on the thermal velocity @xmath168 ) : @xmath194 with @xmath98 and @xmath183 , and @xmath195 with @xmath66 and @xmath196 . while the behavior of the two is similar for @xmath5 and @xmath197 ( the only difference is the factor @xmath198 ) , the first one is expected to be more unstable because of the three times stronger debye screening . at the same time the behavior of the second distribution near the threshold should be close to that of the maxwellian , @xmath66 , despite the very different suprathermal tails and @xmath199 .",
    "we have also proposed a useful approximation for the dielectric function in the range @xmath200 for distributions with sharp maxima of @xmath201 ( maxwellian as one of such distributions ) .",
    "this approximation proves to be quite satisfactory for maxwellian type distributions and allows to study analytically the instability behavior in the maximum growth rate range .",

    "we also assume @xmath251 .",
    "in order to show that the mirror instability is aperiodic we analyze the behavior of the roots of when the @xmath1 parameters are changed . in the waterbag case the transition from the stable to the unstable regimes occurs when @xmath252 and for the mode whose phase velocity is less than the highest particle velocity , @xmath253 ( `` subparticle '' mode ) , that is , in the resonant region . in the general case , where landau damping is nonzero , in the resonant range every propagating wave having @xmath254 has also nonzero damping rate @xmath255 ( we assume that there are no other kinetic instabilities in the mirror - stable region ) . by continuously changing the plasma parameters ( e.g. , the anisotropy ratio @xmath2 ) we can bring the system into the unstable regime . assuming continuous dependence of @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the plasma parameters we see that it is impossible for the `` subparticle '' mode with @xmath256 to transform into the unstable mode , since @xmath255 and can not be made positive continuously .",
    "thus , the only way to do that is to go through @xmath84 , @xmath115 .",
    "let us now consider the vicinity of the transition to the instability , @xmath47 .",
    "in the most general way , expanding @xmath44 in powers of @xmath49 one gets : @xmath257 provided @xmath258 .",
    "the quantities @xmath152 and @xmath259 are defined in  .",
    "it is easy to see that is the first order equation for @xmath260 ( with real coefficients ) in the lowest order on @xmath47 , which means that there is a simple ( one and only one ) aperiodic root in the vicinity of @xmath64 .",
    "such aperiodic solutions can not be converted into non - aperiodic ones by continuous change of the plasma parameters , for the same reason as above .",
    "therefore , the unstable solutions must be aperiodic .",
    "the function @xmath261 , defined in  , is an analytical function of @xmath41 and a continuous function of its parameters @xmath1 and @xmath114 .",
    "let us consider how @xmath49 moves from the lower half - plane ( stable regime ) to the upper half - plane ( unstable regime ) with the change of @xmath1 and @xmath262 .",
    "the transition to instability occurs , in general , in the vicinity of @xmath64 where @xmath263 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : threshold ] ) . in the transition point",
    "@xmath116 . using ",
    "it is easy to show that in the transition point @xmath264 ( provided @xmath265 , this condition being violated if @xmath266 at @xmath5 , corresponding to the regime of two - hump instability ) , so that in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath267 corresponds to the stable regime , while @xmath268 corresponds to the instability . because of the continuity , in the whole instability range @xmath268 .",
    "let us show now that always has a solution @xmath164 , @xmath85 in the unstable range .",
    "indeed , @xmath269 as is shown above .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath270 one has @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "this means that there exists @xmath85 such that @xmath273 .    in the absence of kinetic instabilities , in the stable regime",
    "all roots of with nonzero @xmath90 are either in the lower half - plane ( landau damping or nonpropagation ) or at the real axis ( if @xmath274 . in the first case no root can cross the real axis except at @xmath84 , when the parameters are changed continuously to bring the system in the unstable regime . as can be seen from  there is only one root crossing the real axis at this point , provided @xmath275 .",
    "therefore , there is only one root in the upper half - plane and it is purely imaginary .    if @xmath276 there are two or more roots in the vicinity of @xmath64 ( depending on the behavior of @xmath46 ) but only one is positive , @xmath85 .",
    "since in this case the analytical continuation through @xmath64 into the lower half - plane is straightforward ( no pole at @xmath5 ) other roots correspond to damping solutions , and there is again only one root in the upper half - plane .",
    "finally , let us consider the case where there are roots with @xmath115 and @xmath277 .",
    "such situation can occur when @xmath278 in isolated points or in an interval ( as for the compact waterbag and hard - bell ) . in the first case",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath49 is negative for @xmath90 close to @xmath279 , so that the continuous change of parameters does not bring the root to the upper half - plane .",
