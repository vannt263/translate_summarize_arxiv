    "streaming is known as a bulk vortical movement of the fluid following an intense acoustic wave .",
    "streaming appears in closed and open vessels in two- or three - dimensional geometry and is observed in viscous fluids only . though vortical movement may exist in the linear flow , the reason of streaming are the nonlinear losses of momentum of acoustic field .",
    "a reader is referred to the comprehensive reviews on this subject @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most recent investigations both theoretical and experimental relate to steady ( quasi - steady ) streaming @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that streaming is a slow process in comparison to the ultrasound and may be separated from the originating sound by time - averaging over integer number of periods of sound .",
    "the averaging is a starting point of the modern theory @xcite , @xcite . a driving force of streaming is quadratic and",
    "therefore does not vanish during the temporal averaging .",
    "some inconsistencies of the approach based on temporal averaging are obvious .",
    "it was first pointed out by rudenko and soluyan that studying acoustic streaming while assuming incompressibility was inadequate @xcite .",
    "the effect of compressibility of the fluid has not been discussed in depth .",
    "recently , the importance of compressibility has been demonstrated for flow over plane rigid boundary @xcite .",
    "it is more evident in gases and leads to larger streaming velocities .",
    "we may add that incompressibility neglects not only acoustic waves but also another slow compound of the overall flow , namely the entropy modal field that appears in one - dimensional geometry of flow even .",
    "entropy mode appears due to losses of acoustic energy and therefore has a different nature than streaming .",
    "velocity of this field is small in comparison to streaming @xcite , the main feature of entropy field is slow isobaric growth of temperature that leads to the new background of acoustic wave propagation .",
    "this effect called by acoustic wave self - action is well - studied @xcite . excluding the entropy mode needs a neglecting of equation of energy balance that reduces an initial system of conservation laws and allows to consider flows with unperturbed density . at last ,",
    "an excluding of the energy balance does not allow to account heat conductivity though it has been proved that the effect of the heat conductivity could not be discarded in a study of temperature variation associated with the streaming @xcite .",
    "actually , this approximation is well understood in a typical liquid like water but should be revised for other liquids @xcite .",
    "the dynamic equations are derived by proper combining the conservation laws in differential form .",
    "these calculations may be considered as a certain type of projecting at the chosen type of motion .",
    "we propose to determine modes and correspondent matrix projectors from the very beginning at the level of linearized system of conservation laws .",
    "it seems reasonable to start from the full system of conservation laws including the energy balance equation and the continuity equation to avoid possible inconsistencies .",
    "though ultrasound of many periods is most efficient source of streaming , any other acoustic source in thermoviscous flow gives rise to other modal fields .",
    "the modern theory fails to treat non - periodic sound .",
    "that is one more reason to find new methods ( analytical more desired ) in fluid dynamics and particulary in the theory of streaming .",
    "the idea to decompose the linear flow into specific modes is not novel and has been exploited for a long time , see the paper by chu , and kovasznay @xcite and referred there papers , where homogeneous background with sources of heat and mass are considered .",
    "this paper is almost the only one in which interaction between modes is introduced locally ( see also report by kaner , rudenko , khokhlov @xcite , where a first step has been made in a manner to introduce interaction of opposite acoustic waves via connection equations ) .",
    "the account of nonlinear interactions by chu , and kovasznay @xcite was performed by the simple perturbation theory - by decomposition of each variable in series of small parameters of nonlinearity and dissipation .",
    "the concrete ideas of doing it automatically by using of projectors in the wide variety of problems was realized for flow over inhomogeneous media like bubbly liquid @xcite , flows affected by external forces including the gravitational one which changes the background density and pressure @xcite , both one- and multi - dimensional problems @xcite ) .",
    "the principal advance is an expansion of the ideas into area of nonlinear flow : to get nonlinear coupled evolution equations for interacting modes and to solve the system approximately .",
    "the choice of the subspaces by the projecting ( fixed links between variables ) is the principal point of evolution equations derivation .",
    "it results in the expansion of projection of the evolution operator as a function of a small parameter , that is equivalent to the nonsingular perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "any weak interactions of modes in fluid dynamics may be considered .",
    "streaming is a particular case of the interaction of modes when the acoustic mode is dominant and inverse influence of the growing vortical end entropy modes neglected .",

    "the reason is the constant result of integration of the source from minus infinity till plus infinity .",
    "indeed , there is an attenuation in the very eq.([str ] ) , not only in the attenuated acoustic source , so for the more detail calculations it should be involved .",
    "the radiation force also needs integration over @xmath106 , the constant of integration is chosen to be zero when @xmath107 .",
    "transversal derivatives in formula for the radiation force and @xmath74 are simple when diffraction is ignored : @xmath108 so all calculations of velocity in this paper refer to the point @xmath109 where the radiation force achieves maximum .",

    "it is evident that velocity of streaming tends to a constant level with time passing in contrast to the streaming caused by periodic source when hydrodynamic nonlinearity ignored .",

    "the most important result of the projecting is to get space and temporal structure of any mode independently of the type of source .",
    "the basic idea of the projecting starts from separating modes accordingly to their specific properties in the weakly nonlinear flow . these basic motions ( or eigenvectors of the linear flow ) should be defined at first .",
    "it may be proceeded in the algorithmic way for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous backgrounds ( see paper on interacting modes in bubbly liquid @xcite ) , media affected by external forces and the real geometry of the flow .",

    "the flow in bounded volumes or relating to problems that need special conditions has to be sought as a superposition of specific modes corresponding to the concrete problem .",
    "any mode is distinguished by a correspondent projector at any time .",
    "projectors apply to arbitrary source and type of initial perturbation .",
    "the next , the interaction of modes in weakly nonlinear flow yields in coupled nonlinear equations for the modes that may be solved approximately @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , the evolution equations may be corrected up to the higher order nonlinear terms due to increasing influence of the other generated modes . in the present paper , rightwards acoustic mode",
    "is sought as a dominant one which gives rise to the vortical one .",
    "therefore , the governing equation ( [ str ] ) involves a pure quadratic acoustic source . for more advanced flow , the growing role of the non - dominative modes due to nonlinear interactions may be accounted as well .",
    "the similar calculations were undertaken while one - dimensional flow studied @xcite .    since the method applies to flow with any initial conditions ( including non - acoustic ) and does not need quasi - periodic sources , it is useful for investigation of some special problems like streaming caused by the non - periodic mono - polar acoustic source .",
    "the possibilities of analytical methods in the study of streaming are superior over experimental and purely numerical investigations in the view of complexity of the whole phenomenon . in this paper ,",
    "the general formulae on interacting modes are presented , and the particular case of streaming caused by mono - polar source is discussed and illustrated by numerical calculations .",
    "a special meaning of the quasi - periodic and particulary pulse ultrasound is its importance in medicine , in delicate exploring of the parameters of fluid as well as importance of the secondary modes following the source , e.g.in the sonochemistry @xcite .",
