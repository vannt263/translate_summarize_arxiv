    "with the recent discovery of several extra - solar planets ( and brown dwarfs ) around solar type stars ( e.g.  mayor & queloz 1995 ; buter & marcy 1996 ; basri , marcy & graham 1996 ) the question of the potential existence of extraterrestrial `` intelligent '' civilizations has become more intriguing than ever .",
    "while this topic has been the subject of extensive speculations and many ill - defined ( often by necessity ) probability estimates , at least one study ( carter 1983 ) has examined it from a more global , statistical perspective .",
    "that study concluded , on the basis of the near equality between the timescale of biological evolution on earth , @xmath0 , and the lifetime of the sun , @xmath1 , that extraterrestrial civilizations are exceedingly rare , even if conditions favorable for the development of life are relatively common .",
    "the conclusion on the rarity of extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations ( carter 1983 ; and see also barrow & tipler 1986 ) was based on one crucial _",
    "assumption _ and one _ observation_. the _ assumption _ is that the timescale of biological evolution on a given planet , @xmath0 , and the lifetime of the central star , @xmath2 , are a  priori entirely independent quantities . put differently",
    ", this assumes that intelligent life forms at some random time with respect to the main sequence lifetime of the star .",
    "observation _ is that in the earth - sun system @xmath3 ( to within a factor 2 ; for definiteness i will take from now on @xmath0 to represent the timescale for the appearance of land life ) . for completeness",
    ", i will reproduce here the argument briefly . _",
    "if _ @xmath0 and @xmath2 are indeed independent quantities , then most probably either @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( the set of @xmath3 is of very small measure for two independent quantities ) .",
    "if , however , @xmath6 _ generally _ , then it is very difficult to understand why in the first system found to exhibit an intelligent civilization ( the earth - sun system ) , it was found that @xmath3 .",
    "if , on the other hand , _ generally _ @xmath7 , then it is clear that the first system found to contain an intelligent civilization is likely to have @xmath8 ( since for @xmath7 a civilization would not have developed ) .",
    "thus , according to this argument , one has to conclude that typically @xmath9 , namely , that _ generally _ intelligent civilizations will not develop , and that the earth is the extremely rare exception .",
    "what i intend first to show in the present work is that this conclusion is at best premature , by demonstrating that not only that @xmath0 and @xmath2 may not be independent , but also that @xmath10 may in fact be the _ most probable _ value for this ratio .",
    "this is done in   2 .",
    "i use the recently determined cosmic star formation history to estimate the most likely time for intelligent civilizations to emerge in the universe .",
    "superficially it appears that @xmath0 ( which is determined mainly by biochemical reactions and evolution of species ) and @xmath2 ( which is determined by nuclear burning reactions ) should be independent .",
    "it suffices to note , however , that light energy ( from the central star ) exceeds by 23 orders of magnitude all other sources of energy that can drive chemical evolution in the prebiotic environment ( e.g.  deamer 1997 ) , to realize that @xmath0 may in fact depend on @xmath2 ( note that the statement that intelligent life will not develop for @xmath7 also constitutes a qualitative dependence ) .",
    "below i identify a specific physical process that can , in principle at least , relate the two timescales .",
    "first i would like however to point out the following _ general _ property .",
    "imagine that we find that the ratio @xmath11 can be described by some function of the form @xmath12 , and that we further find that the function @xmath13 is monotonically increasing ( at least for the narrow range of values of @xmath2 corresponding to stars which allow the development of life , see below ) .",
    "this situation is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "in such a case , since for a salpeter initial mass function ( salpeter 1955 ) we have that the distribution of stellar lifetimes behaves like @xmath14 ( since for main sequence stars , @xmath15 e.g.allen 1973 ) , it is immediately clear from fig .  1 , that it is _ most probable _ that in the first place we encounter an intelligent civilization , we will find that @xmath10 ( since the number of stars increases as we move to the right in the diagram ) . therefore , if we can show that some processes are likely to produce a monotonically increasing ( @xmath2 ; @xmath11 ) relation , then the fact that @xmath3 in the earth - sun system will find a natural explanation , and it will not have any implications for the frequency of extraterrestrial civilizations .",
    "i should note though that if the breadth of the ` band ' in fig .",
    "1 becomes extremely large , this is essentially equivalent to no @xmath0@xmath2 relation and carter s argument is recovered .",
    "i will now give a simple example of how a @xmath0@xmath2 relation may arise .",
    "i should emphasize that this is not meant to be understood as a realistic model , but merely to demonstrate that such a relation _",
    "could _ exist .",
    "nucleic acid absorption of uv  radiation peaks between @xmath16  and @xmath17   and that of proteins between @xmath17  and @xmath18(e.g .",
    "davidson 1960 ; sagan 1961 ; caspersson 1950 ) .",
    "absorption in these bands is highly lethal to all known forms of cell activity ( e.g.  berkner 1952 ) .",
    "of all the potential constituents of a planet s atmosphere only o@xmath19 absorbs efficiently in the 20003000  range ( e.g.  watanabe , zelikoff & inn 1958 ) .",
    "it has in fact been suggested that the appearance of land life has to await the build - up of a sufficient layer of protective ozone ( berkner & marshall 1965 ; hart 1978 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to understand the origin and evolution of oxygen in planetary atmospheres . while clearly only a limited knowledge of all the processes involved exists ( and even that only from the earth s atmosphere ) , this will suffice for the purposes of the present example .",
    "two main phases can be identified in the rise of oxygen in planetary atmospheres ( berkner & marshall 1965 ; hart 1978 ; levine , hays & walker 1979 ; canuto et  al .",
    "in the first ( which on earth lasted @xmath20  yr ) , oxygen is released from the photochemical dissociation of water vapor ( this led on earth probably to oxygen levels of @xmath21 of the present atmospheric level ( p.a.l . ) ) . in the second phase ( which on earth lasted @xmath22  yr ) , the amounts of o@xmath23 and o@xmath19 reach levels @xmath24 p.a.l .",
    ", sufficient to shadow the land from lethal uv to allow the spread of life to dry land ( the uv extinction is normally expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the impinging intensity , @xmath27 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath28 is the path length in the atmosphere ) . the important point to note ( berkner &",
    "marshall 1965 ; hart 1978 ) is that the duration of the first phase is inversely proportional to the intensity of the radiation in the range 10002000  ( significant peaks in h@xmath23o absorption exist in the 11001300  and 16001800  ranges ) .",
    "thus , for a given planetary size and orbit , the timescale for the development of shielding ( which we identify approximately with @xmath0 ) is dependent on the stellar spectral type , and therefore on @xmath2",
    ". for typical main sequence star relations , @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 in the range 0.61 , for spectral types f5k5 , see below ) , and empirical fractions of the radiation emitted in the 10002000range ( stecker 1970 ; carruthers 1971 ) , a simple calculation ( e.g.  livio & kopelman 1990 ) leads to an approximate relation of the form @xmath31    = 4.6 in    clearly with the existence of a relation like  ( 1 ) ( which is monotonically increasing ) , the highest probability is to find @xmath3 , and hence the near equality of these two timescales in the earth - sun system can not be taken to imply that extraterrestrial civilizations are rare .",
    "i should note again that the detailed evolution of the atmosphere is surely more complicated than a simple dependence on the intensity of uv photons .",
    "in particular , it may be that the different phases of the evolution have different dependences on the properties of the central star .",
    "the important point , however , is that , as the above example shows , the _ existence _ of a @xmath0@xmath2 relation is not implausible , and that @xmath32 ) _ could _ increase faster than linearly .",
    "given that extraterrestrial `` intelligent '' civilizations may not be exceedingly rare after all , one may ask what is a likely time in the history of the universe for such civilizations to emerge .",
    "i will restrict the discussion now to carbon - based civilizations . assuming a principle of ` mediocrity '",
    ", one would expect the emergence to coincide perhaps with the peak in the carbon production rate .",
    "the main contributors of carbon to the interstellar medium are intermediate mass stars ( wood 1981 ; yungelson , tutukov & livio 1993 ) through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) phases .",
    "recent progress has been made in the understanding of the cosmic history of the star formation rate ( sfr ) ( e.g.  madau et  al.1996 ; lilly et  al .",
    "1996 ; madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1997 ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that all the galaxies follow the same sfr history and stellar evolution processes , we can calculate the rate of formation of planetary nebulae ( and hence the rate of carbon production ) as a function of redshift . for this purpose a population synthesis code which follows the evolution of all the stars ( assumed to be mainly in binaries ) , including all episodes of mass exchange , common envelope phases etc .",
    ", has been used ( see yungelson , tutukov & livio 1993 ; yungelson et  al .",
    "1996 for details of the code ; i am grateful to lev yungelson for carrying out the simulations ) . in fig .  2 , the assumed sfr as a function of redshift ( taken as an approximation to the results in madau et  al .  1996 ) and the obtained pne formation rate as a function of redshift",
    "are shown . as can be seen , the peak in the pn rate is somewhat delayed ( to @xmath33 ) with respect to the peak in the sfr , and is much more shallow at @xmath34 , due to the build - up of a reservoir during the previous epochs .",
    "realizing that continuously habitable zones ( chzs ) exist only around stars in the spectral range of about f5 to mid k ( e.g.  kasting , whitmore & reynolds 1993 ) , and that in general the biochemistry of life requires rather precise conditions , carbon - based life may be expected to start ( with the assumed sfr history ) around @xmath35 , corresponding to an age of the universe of @xmath36  yr ( for @xmath37 , as seems to be indicated by recent observations , e.g.  garnavich et  al .  1998 ; parlmutter et  al.1998 ; reiss , press & kirshner 1996 ; carlberg et  al .",
    "1997 , and a present age of @xmath38 billion years ) .",
    "given the fact that ( as i have shown in the previous section ) the time required to develop intelligent civilizations is @xmath3 , it is expected that civilizations will emerge when the age of the universe is @xmath39  billion years , or maybe even somewhat older , since the chzs around k  stars are somewhat wider ( in log distance ) than around g  stars . a younger emergence age will be obtained if the star formation rate does not decline at redshifts @xmath40 , but rather stays flat ( as is perhaps suggested by the recent cobe diffuse background experiment ; hauser et  al .",
    "1998 ; calzetti & heckman 1998 ) .",
    "finally , i should note that the arguments presented in this paper should definitely not be taken as attempting to imply that extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations do exist .",
    "rather , they show that the conclusion that they do nt , is at best premature ( see also rees 1997 for discussions of related issues ) ."
