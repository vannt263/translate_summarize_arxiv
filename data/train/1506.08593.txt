    "the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , where the absorption of a weak probe laser on one transition is reduced using a strong control laser on an auxiliary transition , is well - studied in three - level systems , in all the three configurations namely lambda ( @xmath1 ) , vee ( v ) , and ladder ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "but the related phenomenon of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia)enhanced absorption of the probe laser  is possible only when there are at least four levels , so that additional control lasers can be used .",
    "eia has been studied  both theoretically and experimentally  in n - type ( @xmath3 ) four - level systems @xcite .",
    "the other four - level systems , namely y - type ( @xmath4 ) , inverted y - type ( @xmath5 ) , and tripod - type ( @xmath6 ) , only show enhanced eit .",
    "in this work , we present theoretical analysis of a new kind of four - level system formed by the combination of v and @xmath7 three - level systems , which shows eia resonances .",
    "this configuration opens up the possibility of the experimental study of eia in an important class of atoms called rydberg atoms , because such atoms have a highly excited atomic state allowing the formation of a @xmath2-type system .",
    "rydberg atoms have thus been used to study eit phenomena @xcite , and the present analysis allows the extension to the observation of eia in such atoms .    for application to a real system , we choose energy levels of @xmath0rb , and present results for both stationary atoms and moving atoms in room temperature vapor .",
    "an eia peak with negative dispersion is observed at zero probe detuning when the control fields have equal strengths .",
    "it * switches * to an eit peak with positive dispersion ( due to splitting of the eia peak ) when the control fields are unequal .",
    "thus , the atomic medium can be switched from eia and super - luminal light propagation to eit and sub - luminal light propagation .",

    "the ground state @xmath8 is coupled with state @xmath9 by a weak probe field .",
