    "2002 ) , spectacular events during which the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy rises from few solar masses per year , typical of spirals such as the milky - way ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , to several hundred solar masses per year as in the local ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ; genzel et al . 1998 ; sanders & ishida 2004 ) where merger - driven starbursts take place in very compact ( d@xmath6100300pc ) dense gas disks ( e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ; sakamoto et al . 2008 ) . in the so called sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) ,",
    "similarly merger - driven starbursts in the distant universe , sfrs can even reach thousands of solar masses per year ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; eales et al .",
    "1999 ) . while stars form invariably out of molecular gas throughout the universe ( e.g. solomon et al .",

    "1998 , 1999 ; greve et al .",
    "2005 , tacconi et al .",

    "2008 ) . indeed , while photon - dominated - regions ( pdrs ) contain the bulk of the molecular gas mass in galaxies ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ; ossenkopf et al .",
    "2007 ) , their widely varying physical conditions remain always far removed from those prevailing in uv - shielded cr - dominated dense gas cores .",
    "the location of the latter deep inside molecular clouds , a strong temperature regulation via the onset of gas - dust thermal equillibrium at densities @xmath17@xmath2010@xmath4@xmath14 , and the nearly complete dissipation of supersonic turbulence ( larson 2005 ; bergin & tafalla 2007 ; jappsen et al .",
    "2005 ) , all help to keep the thermal state of typical crdrs a near invariant over a wide range of ism environments .    cosmic rays ( crs ) , accelerated in shocks around supernovae remnants ( snrs ) or winds associated with o , b star clusters ( e.g. binns et al .",
    "2008 ) , are responsible for the heating , ionization level , and chemical state of such dense uv - shielded regions in molecular clouds ( e.g. goldmith & langer 1978 ; goldsmith 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , while their heating contribution relative to that from the ( far - uv)-induced photoelectric effect in pdrs , or turbulence , can vary within a galaxy and individual molecular clouds , crs remain responsible for setting the _ minimum _ temperature attainable in the gaseous ism ( e.g. goldmith & langer 1978 ; bergin & tafalla 2007 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "for the galaxy @xmath21(min)@xmath610k , reached in uv - shielded cores with @xmath17@xmath6(@xmath22@xmath23)@xmath14 .",
    "a recent study has shown that the average cr energy densities ( @xmath0 ) in compact starbursts typical in ulirgs ( recently found also in an smg at z@xmath62.3 , swinbank et al .",
    "2010 ) , will be boosted by the tremendeous factors of @xmath24@xmath25(few)@xmath26(10@xmath310@xmath4)@xmath5 , potentially transforming their ism into extreme cosmic - ray - dominated regions ( crdrs ) .",
    "this will dramatically alter the thermal and ionization state of uv - shielded cores , and thus the initial conditions of star - formation , throughout their considerable molecular gas reservoirs ( @xmath2710@xmath28 - 10@xmath29m@xmath30 ) .",
    "higher characteristic mass @xmath31 for the young stars formed in such ism environments , and longer ambipolar diffusion timescales for the cr - heated uv - shieled cores could thus be a new paradigm for high - density star formation in the universe ( see papadopoulos 2010 for details ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recently such large @xmath32 boosts ( @xmath33@xmath34u@xmath35 ) have been found in the oriona bar , and while not representing the average sf initial conditions in the galaxy , they do allow local studies of the effects of large cr energy densities on the ism ( pellegrini et al 2009 ) .",
    "finally crs have been shown to effect the thermal state of primordial gas , catalyzing h@xmath36 formation in the absence of dust ( jasche , ciardi , & ensslin 2007 ) .    in this work",
    "we solve the coupled chemical and thermal state equations for uv - shielded gas and its concomitant dust in extreme crdrs without the approximations employed by papadopoulos ( 2010 ) .",
    "we then use the thermal states computed for such a gas phase to examine the effects on @xmath37 and the so - called inflection point of the effective equation of state ( eos ) , set at gas densities above which @xmath38@xmath1@xmath16 ( e.g. spaans & silk 2000 ; larson 2005 and references therein ) . both of these play a crucial role in determining the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in galaxies , which could thus turn out to be very different in the crdrs of extreme starbursts . throughout this work",
    "we make the standard assumption of @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 ( sfr _ density _ ) as in papadopoulos 2010 , though we now discuss possible caveats ( section 4.4 ) .",
    "finally , the different imfs expected in extreme crdrs will modify the total sfr and @xmath42 values computed in galaxies ( from e.g. cm non - thermal or ir thermal continuum ) . in this new context and throughout this work sfr and @xmath43 will now denote these quantities only for the massive stars ( which define @xmath39 and power the ir / cm continuum of the ism ) , with their total values necessarily remaining uncertain , depending on the exact imf , which will no longer be an invariant .",
    "in this section we compute the equillibrium gas temperatures for the uv - shielded regions of molecular clouds immersed in the large cosmic ray energy densities of the extreme crdrs expected in starbursts with high sfr densities .",
    "we first consider the simple case where the chemical state of the uv - shielded dense gas cores remains unaltered and the only effect of large @xmath39 values is to heat them much more than in quiescent ism environments .",
    "following standard practice ( e.g. goldmith 2001 ) the temperature of such regions can be estimated from the thermal balance equation    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the cr heating with @xmath47@xmath48@xmath32 being the cosmic ray ionization rate . the cooling term @xmath49 is dominated by co and other molecular lines , while @xmath50 accounts for gas cooling due to the gas - dust interaction .",
    "a significant point of departure from the previous analysis by papadopoulos ( 2010 ) is the inclusion of the atomic fine structure lines oi ( at 63@xmath51 m ) and cii ( at 158@xmath51 m ) in @xmath52 .",
    "indeed for the cr - boosted temperatures expected in the uv - shielded dense gas of extreme crdrs , and unlike the corresponding gas phase in the quiescent ism of the galaxy , the cooling from the fine structure atomic line of oi ( 63@xmath51 m ) can also become important and along with the gas - dust interaction overtake the co lines for typical core densities of @xmath17@xmath5310@xmath12@xmath14 when @xmath15@xmath2050k .",
    "finally ism - cr interactions can generate internal uv radiation which destroys co , producing traces of cii , thus cooling via its fine structure line at 158@xmath54 m must also be included .",
    "the thermal balance equation encompassing all physical processes that can be important in the uv - shielded ism of extreme crdrs thus  is :    @xmath55    ( for the expressions used see the appendix ) .",
    "the solutions are shown in figure  1 from where it becomes obvious that the minimum temperatures attainable in dense gas cores in the ism of such starbursts are much higher than in the galaxy or galaxies with moderate @xmath41 values .",
    "turbulent gas heating was not considered since we want to compute the minimum temperature values for uv - shielded gas and since supersonic turbulence ( and thus shock - heating ) has usually dissipated in dense pre - stellar gas cores where the initial conditions of sf are set .    from figure 1",
    "it can be seen that the minimum gas temperatures possible in extreme crdrs are lower than those computed by papadopoulos ( 2010 ) , a result of the extra cooling power emanating from the now included atomic transitions that become excited at the high temperatures now possible in an ism permeated by large cr energy densities .",
    "nevertheless these minimum possible gas temperatures remain @xmath6510 times higher in extreme crdrs than those in the milky way or galaxies with moderate @xmath42 values .",
    "any ir radiation `` leaking '' deep in the cloud and warming the concomitant dust above @xmath1(810)k , or any remnant turbulent gas heating ( pan & padoan 2010 ) can only raise these minimum temperatures further .      the thermal balance equation for uv - shielded , cr - heated gas ( equation 2 ) and its solutions ( figure  1 ) , while physically transparent",
    ", they do not account for the fact that ism chemistry ( and thus the abundance of coolants ) is also strongly cr - regulated in such regions .",
    "this makes the problems of thermal and chemical balance of cr - dominated gas strongly coupled that must be solved together , especially given the very large cr energy densities possible in the crdrs of compact starbursts .",
    "we do so by utilizing the advanced time - dependant ucl - pdr code ( the latest version described in bell et al .",
    "2007 ) to compute gas temperatures of cr - heated molecular cloud interiors self - consistently with their cr - regulated chemistry for a wide range of cr energy densities .",
    "this model has already been successfully used several times to model pdrs in the galaxy ( e.g. thi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the heating mechanisms included are : ( i ) photoelectric effect from silicate grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , ( ii ) h@xmath57 formation on gain surfaces , ( iii ) h@xmath57 photodissociation , ( iv ) h@xmath57 uv fluorescence , ( v ) cii recombination , ( vi ) interaction of low - energy cosmic rays with the gas .",
    "the latter dominate gas heating deep inside h@xmath36 clouds ( @xmath58@xmath595 ) where dense gas cores reside and the initial conditions for star formation are set . at cloud surfaces hot gas",
    "emits ly@xmath60 and oi63@xmath54 m lines while deeper in ( @xmath61@xmath200.1 ) , gas cooling occurs via fine - structure line emission of oxygen and neutral and singly ionized carbon .",
    "vibrational and ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath57 and co also cool the gas while co rotational lines are excellent coolants for the cold inner regions as the first rotationally - excited level reaches down to 5.5  k. the interaction between the gas and the dust grains acts as cooling or heating agent for the gas depending on the difference between the gas and dust temperature .",
    "h@xmath57 and co self - shielding are taken into account .",
    "the code calculates the gas chemical abundances , emergent cooling line fluxes , and temperatures self - consistently at each depth in the cloud , and it has been benchmarked against other state - of - the art photodissociation region codes in rllig , m. et al . (",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we set a nominal incident far - uv field of @xmath62=1 in habing units ( expected to be even lower for the dense pre - stellar cores deep inside h@xmath36 clouds ) and a residual micro - turbulent line width of @xmath63=5kms@xmath64 ( which enters the expressions of line optical depths ) . in all cases chemical and thermal equillibrium",
    "is reached fast , within t@xmath65@xmath66yrs , and is always shorter than the local dynamical timescale which drives the ambient star formation events and thus the temporal evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the results , shown in figure  2 , corroborate the high gas temperatures obtained using the simpler method .",
    "this reveals the cosmic rays as _ the most important feedback aspect of star formation _",
    "capable of significantly altering its initial conditions during events of high star formation density via the strong heating of the deeply embedded and uv - shielded dense gas regions of molecular clouds .",
    "it can thus operate unhindered in the high dust extinction environments of extreme starbursts such as local ulirgs or high redshift smgs .",
    "we also ran the same grid of models with the incident far - uv radiation field scaling exactly as the cr energy densities which corresponds to the maximum incident radiation field that can be expected for dense gas cores ( in practice pre - stellar cores are always uv - shielded deep inside molecular clouds ) .",
    "the dust temperature is now more important than in the previous case of @xmath67=1 , and is computed as part of the code .",
    "its value inside the cloud can influence : the cooling by emitting ir photons which interact with line radiative transfer , the h@xmath36 formation by changing the sticking probability , the evaporation / condensation of molecules , and most importantly the gas - grain heating / cooling .",
    "the ucl - pdr code uses a modified version of the formula of hollenbach , takahashi , & tielens ( 1991 ) ( hereafter htt ) corrected for the various mean grain sizes .",
    "the htt formula has been further modified to include attenuation of the far - ir radiation .",
    "the incident fuv radiation is absorbed and re - emitted in the infrared by dust at the surface of the cloud ( up to @xmath68@xmath111mag ) . in the htt derivation",
    ", this fir radiation then serves as a second heat source for dust deeper into the cloud .",
    "however in their model this secondary radiation component is not attenuated with distance into the cloud , remaining undiminished with depth and leading to higher dust temperatures deep into the cloud , which in turn heats the gas to unrealistic temperatures .",
    "attenuation of the fir radiation has been introduced by using an approximation for the infrared - only dust temperature from rowan - robinson ( 1980 ) , his equation 30b : @xmath69=@xmath70 where @xmath71 is the cloud depth corresponding to @xmath68=1mag outer slab that processes the incident fuv radiation and then re - emits it in the fir .    from figure 3",
    "it can be readily seen that the gas temperatures remain invariant beyond @xmath68@xmath65 even with with incident far - uv fields as enhanced as the cr energy densities .",
    "this essentially leaves crs _ as the only strong feedback factor of star formation operating efficiently deep inside molecular clouds .",
    "_ moreover , intense cr heating of uv - shielded gas strongly decouples gas and dust temperature even at high densities ( figures 1 , 2 , 3 ) with important implications on the gas fragmentation properties and thus on the emergent stellar imf ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the new detailed thermo - chemical calculations presented here support the results from the previous study of crdrs and the effects of high @xmath32 values on the initial conditions of star formation ( papadopoulos 2010 ) .",
    "the thermal state of uv - shielded dense gas is indeed dramatically altered in the crdrs of extreme starbursts , and this will affect its jeans mass , gas fragmentation properties , and the charecteristic mass @xmath72 of young stars .",
    "this contradicts the results by elemgreen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which , while correctly considering the uv - shielded gas phase as the one where the sf initial conditions are set , it omitted crs from its thermal balance .",
    "it must be pointed out that while several other studies investigated the effects of starburst environments on the imf , all ( besides the one by elmegreen et al .",
    "2008 ) failed to consider the ism phase where the initial conditions of sf are actually set ( the crdrs ) .",
    "instead they used physical properties typical of pdrs ( e.g. klessen et al .",
    "2007 ) which , while dominating the observed dust seds and molecular line spectral energy distributions ( sleds ) of galaxies , they are hardly representative of the physical conditions expected in their crdrs . even for mildly sf ir - luminous galaxies",
    "the dust temperature typical of their global seds is @xmath1(3040)k , which is well above @xmath16@xmath6(810)k expected in their crdrs .",
    "using inappropriate pdr - type initial conditions of star formation in numerical models : a ) would make them hard - pressed to account even for the near - invariant imf found in the galaxy ( as the wide range of physical conditions in its massive pdr gas phase would yield a wide range of imfs ) , b ) omits the significant , cr - induced , thermal decoupling between gas and dust ( figures 2 , 3 ) .",
    "the latter fundamentally impacts the so - called inflection point of effective equation of state ( eos ) used in all realistic ( i.e non isothermal ) numerical simulations of molecular cloud fragmentation ( e.g. jappsen et al . 2005 ; bonnell et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this is further discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the thermal state of these dense pre - stellar gas cores is no longer a near - invariant but is instead strongly altered by the high cr energy density backgrounds of extreme starbursts , inevitably affecting the fragmentation of those gas regions towards protostars .",
    "indeed , the jeans mass for such cr - heated cores    @xmath73^{-1/2}\\ , m_{\\odot},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    rises from @xmath74@xmath10.3m@xmath75 when @xmath76(h@xmath36)=10@xmath12@xmath14 and @xmath15=10k ( typical for the galaxy ) , to @xmath77@xmath1(310)m@xmath30 for @xmath78@xmath6(50110)k expected for same density h@xmath36 gas immersed in the very large cr energy densities of extreme starbursts .",
    "the near - invariance of @xmath79 in galaxies ( elmegreen et al . 2008 ) is thus upended in starbursts with high sfr densities . in figure 4 the @xmath80 values computed for molecular gas immersed in the crdrs of compact extreme starbursts",
    "are shown for a gas density range typical for star - forming molecular clouds . for @xmath81@xmath5910@xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath80 increases by a factor of @xmath610 across the entire range , which will invariably lead to a higher @xmath82 and thus a top - heavy imf ( larson et al . 2005 ; elmegreen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the wide range of densities over which this occurs makes this conclusion independent of the specific details of molecular cloud fragmentation as long as @xmath83 $ ] drives the fragmentation process outcome at each spatial and temporal point @xmath84 .",
    "the latter is the current consensus on the role of the jeans mass in molecular cloud fragmentation towards a stellar imf , though the views regarding the particular gas phase whose @xmath80 sets the @xmath82 vary ( e.g. klessen 2004 ; bonnell et al .",
    "2006 ) .    if @xmath85@xmath48@xmath86 at the _ onset _ of molecular cloud fragmentation ( klessen 2004 ) , the cr - boost of @xmath82 in extreme crdrs is obvious from the large vertical displacement of the @xmath80 values in figure  4 . in a non - isothermal gravoturbulent molecular cloud fragmentation scheme ( e.g. jappsen et al .",
    "2005 ) it is @xmath87@xmath11@xmath88(@xmath89 ) at a characteristic gas density @xmath89 above which efficient gas - dust thermal coupling lowers the gas temperature in crdrs towards a minimum value of @xmath90(min)@xmath6@xmath16 ( larson 2005 ) . for the galaxy this occurs at @xmath91@xmath110@xmath12@xmath14 , a density that marks also the transition to near - isothermal cloud regions where thermal motions dominate over supersonic turbulence ( larson 2005 ; bergin & tafalla 2007 ) . from figures 2 , 3",
    "it is obvious that the high cr energy densities in extreme crdrs _ will keep the gas and dust thermally decoupled , with @xmath92(min)@xmath93@xmath9 _ , and thus a characteristic density can no longer be marked by the onset of thermal equillibrium between gas and dust .",
    "such cr - induced effects have been long suspected for the dense molecular gas in the galactic center ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in the cr - innudated molecular clouds of extreme starbursts",
    "a characteristic density in the ism can now remain only as the one where the supersonic turbulence has fully dissipated and overtaken by thermal motions in pre - stellar cores , a prerequisite for their efficient gravitational collapse ( e.g. krumholz & mckee 2005 ) .",
    "the average density of such transition regions can be estimated from two well - known scaling relations in molecular clouds : @xmath94=@xmath95 ( linewidth - size ) and @xmath96=@xmath97 ( density - size ) after setting @xmath98(min)=@xmath99 as the minimum linewidth possible , and solving for the corresponding mean volume  density ,    @xmath100    for h=1/2 ( expected for gas clouds virialiazed under external pressure , elemgreen 1989 ) , @xmath101=1.1kms@xmath64 , and for @xmath102=few@xmath10310@xmath3@xmath14 , it is @xmath104@xmath25few@xmath10510@xmath4@xmath14 . for the cr - boosted gas temperatures in extreme starbursts where typically @xmath106(min)@xmath6100k ( figures 1 , 2 , 3 ) : @xmath107@xmath108few@xmath109@xmath14 , and the ( turbulent gas)@xmath110(thermal core ) transition will occur at lower densities _ as well as _ higher ( cr - boosted ) gas temperatures than in quiescent crdrs",
    "this will then shift the expected @xmath111 both vertically ( higher temperatures ) , as well as to the left ( lower densities ) of figure 4 , yielding even higher @xmath112 values than those resulting from only a vertical shift of @xmath113 because of cr - boosted gas temperatures .",
    "thus irrespective of molecular cloud fragmentation details , _ a much larger characteristic mass of young stars is expected in the cr - innudated molecular clouds of extreme starbursts .",
    "_ however the exact shape and mass scale of the new stellar imf can only be determined with dedicated molecular cloud fragmentation simulations that make use of the new sf initial conditions in extreme crdrs , along with an eos appropriate for the very different thermal and ionization state of their molecular gas .      the importance of the effective equation of state ( eos ) , parametrized as a polytrope p=@xmath114 , in the fragmentation properties and emergent mass spectrum of turbulent self - gravitating gas has been well - documented in a few seminal papers ( li et al . 2003 ; jappsen et al .",
    "2005 ; bonnell et al . 2006 ; klessen et al .",
    "2007 ) revealing a crucial role for @xmath115 in defining the shape of the collapsed gas core mass distribution ( and hence the stellar imf ) .",
    "the eos , its polytropic index @xmath115 as a function of density , and their dependance on ism properties such as metallicity , and physical conditions such as the elevated cmb at high redshifts have also been well - documented ( spaans & silk 2000 , 2005 ) , with the so - called eos inflection point emerging as a general characteristic . in an eos that seems well - approximated by a piecewise polytrope with two distinct @xmath115 values ,",
    "the latter is simply the characteristic density @xmath116",

    "a `` sharpening '' of that inflection point is thought to occur because of warm dust .",
    "there @xmath115 reaches up to @xmath61.4 and stays above unity for densities past the inflection point @xmath121@xmath1(10@xmath410@xmath12)@xmath14 ( spaans & silk 2005 ) , which surpresses molecular cloud fragmentation while `` tilting '' it towards top heavy imfs ( e.g. li et al .",

    "unfortunately pdr - like ism has been used to set the sf initial conditions for starbursts in all of the aforementioned models , even though the dust in crdrs ( where these conditions are really set ) remains cool , much lower than the gas , especially in extreme crdrs .",

    "it is actually this robustness of dust temperatures inside crdrs , along with a strong gas - dust coupling at high densities ( when @xmath39 values are modest ) that helps retain : the thermal states of the pre - stellar gas cores , the @xmath72 values , and the imf , as near invariants over a wide range of ambient pdr conditions ( elmegreen et al .",
    "2008 )    thus pdr conditions , while always dominating the observed dust seds and molecular sleds of even mildly sf galaxies ( as pdrs are warm _ and _ contain the bulk of the ism mass ) _ they are not representative of the sf initial conditions in galaxies , _ which are set in crdrs .",
    "this leaves the pre - stellar gas phase in them , amounting to a few% of the mass per giant molecular cloud ( @xmath6sf efficiency per typical gmc ) , yet to be explored in terms of its eos and fragmentation properties .",
    "a detailed exploration of those in crdrs will be the subject of a future paper , but figures 2 and 3 already show that crs , by inducing a strong decoupling of the gas and dust temperatures with @xmath21@xmath8@xmath16 , they `` erase '' any putative eos inflection point for gas densities up to @xmath130=10@xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "this will maintain efficient molecular gas cooling , with cooling times always much shorter than dynamical times ( figure 5 ) , and @xmath131@xmath1171 in crdrs over the entire gas density range explored here .",
    "in such regions gas gravoturbulent fragmentation will then occur equally efficiently from n@xmath25@xmath132@xmath14 up to @xmath110@xmath13@xmath14 yielding a pure power law imf ( spaans & silk 2000 ; li et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the latter result , along with our discussion in 3.1 makes clear that the stellar imf will be very different in extreme crdrs , though only detailed gravoturbulent simulations with the appropriate initial conditions , and performed with a new suitable eos can decide its exact shape and mass scale .",
    "it must be also noted that the very high ionization fractions in extreme crdrs can now `` anchor '' the magnetic field for much longer periods , and at much higher densities , as ambipolar diffusion in such regions is now much prolonged ( papadopoulos 2010 ) .",
    "magnetic fields may thus remain important during much later stages of gas fragmentation , even in a highly turbulent medium , and may thus have to be included in the simulations of this process in extreme crdrs .",
    "the current study supports the recently suggested role of crs as a decisive sf feedback factor , capable of altering the sf initial conditions and the imf in extreme crdrs . in this section",
    "we discuss some of the consequences beyond the immediate issues of the ism and the stellar imf in such enviornments , and outline current and future observations that can shed light on these new sf initial conditions that will be typical in high sfr density events in the universe .",
    "the dependance of the thermo - chemical and ionization state of pre - stellar dense gas in crdrs on the average @xmath39 permeating the ism of a galaxy naturally links the sf initial conditions and the resulting imf to the average sfr density @xmath134 , provided @xmath135 .",

    "is obvious that for typical sf disks ( @xmath24@xmath137(0.210)@xmath103@xmath138 ) no substantial effects on the gas temperatures and jeans masses in crdrs are expected while in the extreme cdrds of compact starbursts ( @xmath24@xmath137(10@xmath310@xmath4)@xmath139@xmath138 ) very warm gas and large jeans masses will lead to an effective surpression of low - mass star formation and hence a top - heavy imf . for",
    "merger - driven star formation the latter may characterize entire star - forming episodes ( i.e. until the in - situ molecular gas reservoir is nearly exausted ) as dissipation can continously `` funnel '' the large molecular gas masses of the progenitors towards very compact ( @xmath1(100500)pc ) regions where extreme , eddington - limited sf , takes place with tremendeous ir brightness of @xmath140@xmath11(few)@xmath13910@xmath141l@xmath30kpc@xmath142 ( e.g. thompson 2009 ) . such high ir brightness , and thus high sfr densities ,",
    "have been recently deduced also in a distant smg ( swinbank et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "thus cr - controlled sf initial conditions naturally yield a bimodal sf process in galaxies , with high @xmath134 values providing the branching point , as follows : + ( merger - driven sf)@xmath143(high @xmath41)@xmath110(high @xmath32)@xmath143(top heavy imf ) , + ( regular disk sf)@xmath143(low @xmath41)@xmath110(low @xmath32)@xmath143(galactic imf ) . +",
    "this proposed @xmath41-imf link can then parametrize such an sf bimodality in hierarchical galaxy formation , once imf = f(@xmath144 ) `` libraries '' are obtained from e.g. gravoturbulent simulations of molecular cloud fragmentation for a range of @xmath144 values .",
    "a top - heavy imf in high-@xmath145 systems will have very serious implications on the actual sfrs deduced from the ir luminosities of these typically very dust - enshrouded systems ( where all the far - uv light from massive stars is reprocessed into ir ) .",
    "their cr - induced top - heavy imfs will now correspond to several times higher energy outputs per stellar mass , and the sfrs in such systems will have to be revised downwards by identical factors .      a @xmath43-dependent imf as the natural outcome of cr - controlled sf initial conditions in galaxies can also naturaly yield integrated galactic imfs ( igimfs ) that depend on the star formation history ( sfh ) of galaxies .",
    "this is because @xmath146 can be a strong function of the evolution of a galaxy , especially during its early and presumably gas - rich state even when no mergers are involved .",
    "such a sfh - dependance of the igimfs has been considered before as the cause of the well - known mass - metallicity relation of galaxies ( kppen , weidner , & kroupa 2007 ) .",
    "setting @xmath39@xmath147@xmath134 in crdrs assumes that crs can freely penetrate and warm the entire volume of a gmc down to its densest uv - shielded regions .",
    "recent gamma - ray observations have directly measured cr energy densities in the nucleus of a nearby galaxy on par with those computed for extreme crdrs and expected from its sfr density , while indicating only mildly calorimetric conditions for the cr / ism p - p interactions ( acero et el . 2009 ) .",
    "the latter supports an unhintered cr penetration through the molecular clouds .",
    "nevertheless alfvn waves generated _ outside _ such clouds by a net flux of crs in their environments could be effective in keeping low energy crs below a few hundred mev ( those most effective in heating the gas ) outside their high density regions ( skilling & strong 1976 ) , which in turn would affect their thermal balance , their fragmentation properties , and the emergent stellar imf .",
    "thus the coupled problems of cr transport , magnetic field dynamics , and gravoturbulent evolution of non - isothermal dense molecular gas with high degrees of ionization like those expected in compact extreme starbursts such as arp220 ( e.g. greve et al . 2009 ) must be investigated with dedicated mhd simulations .",
    "the detections of @xmath148-ray emission from two nearby galaxies , namely m82 and the starburst nucleus of ngc253 ( acciari et al .",
    "2009 , acero et al .",
    "2009 ) , are two very important recent developments in @xmath115-ray astronomy , given that @xmath115-ray emission results from cr proton interactions with the molecular ism .",
    "this allows such observations to directly measure the average cr energy densities in sf environments , and thus sensitive such measurements in ulirgs such as the nearby ulirg arp220 will be very important in revealing extreme crdrs in such systems .",
    "on the other hand , direct measurements of the expected top - heavy imfs in the heavily dust - enshrouded compact starbursts where extreme crdrs would reside are impossible .",
    "however any cases where the `` end '' products , i.e. the stellar populations , of high-@xmath145 sf events can be observed and their imf determined such as the galactic center ( gc ) and local ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) allow such direct observational tests .",
    "there is indeed strong evidence of cr heating of the dense molecular gas in the gc , setting @xmath149@xmath20@xmath16 , and expected strong effects on the local jeans mass and ambipolar diffusion timescales ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2007 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "initial assertions about a top - heavy imf in the gc ( e.g. nayakshin & sunyaev 2005 ) and the massive arches cluster near it ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ; stolte et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) have not been corroborated by later studies ( kim et al .",
    "2006 ; espinoza et al . 2009 ; lckmann et al .",
    "2010 ) . on the other hand some evidence exists for a top - heavy imf in the nuclear starburst of m82 ( e.g. rieke et al . 1980 ; 1993 ) , and a significantly enhanced @xmath32 is certainly there ( @xmath6500@xmath2@xmath138 , directly measured via @xmath131-ray observations ; acciari et al .",
    "2009 ) to achieve this via a cr - boosted @xmath19 imf mass scale . indeed for such @xmath24 values , setting @xmath150@xmath25@xmath151 yields @xmath152(m82)@xmath202m@xmath30 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "however the galactic center does offer an example of regions with locally boosted @xmath0 values that do not necessarily correspond to top - heavy imfs in their vicinity , possibly because such boosts are too short and transient to systematically bias the local emergent imf .",
    "stronger evidence for top - heavy imfs exists in ucds , small stellar systems with r@xmath153@xmath1(1030)pc ( half - light radius ) where @xmath27(10@xmath1310@xmath154)m@xmath155 of gas have been converted into stars at @xmath156@xmath6(10100)m@xmath30yr@xmath64 ( see dabringhausen et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) . unlike the gc where imf studies are hindered by high extinction and tidal disruption of clusters , and where any high-@xmath145 sf episodes may have been short - lived ( and thus could not significantly bias its average imf towards a top - heavy one ) , the imfs in ucds are much more amenable to systematic studies , while their sf episodes have had @xmath157@xmath120@xmath158 !",
    "they are thus ideal targets for studying the imf resulting from completed high-@xmath159 sf events .",
    "the next best thing besides studies of the imf itself is studies of the ism in crdrs from which the imf emerges , especially those in compact extreme starbursts where @xmath160 is very high ( e.g. ulirgs ) versus systems with more distributed sf and much lower @xmath145 values .",
    "the unique observational signatures of the very warm dense gas with high ionization fractions expected in extreme crdrs have already been discussed in some detail by papadopoulos ( 2010 ) , and the interested reader is refered to this work . in summary , in the era of herschel and the upcoming era of alma the sole main obstacle is the degeneracy of extreme crdr diagnostic with that of x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) induced in the ism by an x - ray luminous agn . indeed ,",
    "unless an x - ray luminous agn can be excluded by other independent means ( e.g. deep x - ray observations ) , it can be difficult to tell extreme crdrs and xrds apart in a simple fashion as even exotic high excitation species such as oh@xmath161 and h@xmath36o@xmath161 , recently detected by herschel in the archetypal ulirg / qso mrk231 and attributed to xdrs ( van der werf et al .",
    "2010 ) , could be partly due to crdrs . in recent work meijerink",
    "2010 provide a detailed discussion of diagnostics lines in extreme crdrs versus xdrs and the key observations that can separate them .",
    "finally it is worth noting that x - rays and xdrs will have similar effects as crs on the jeans mass and the imf of uv - shielded dense gas regions as both can volumetrically warm such regions to high temperatures .",
    "this was pointed out recently by bradford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the ism of a distant qso , and constitutes an omitted aspect of agn feedback on star formation .",
    "this has been studied recently and shown to lead to a top - heavy imf ( hocuk & spaans 2010 ) .",
    "xdrs besides elevating @xmath162(min ) to much higher values than in the galaxy they also yield @xmath38@xmath8@xmath9 ( and thus they can also `` erase '' the eos inflection point ) , though unlike crdrs their influence on the ism is necessarily limited by the @xmath6@xmath163 geometric factor ( @xmath164 the distance of the irradiated gas from the  agn ) .",
    "we have conducted new , detailed calculations on the thermal balance of uv - shielded dense gas in cosmic - ray - dominated - regions ( crdrs ) , the ism phase where the initial conditions of star formation are set in galaxies , in order to examine in detail the effects of extreme crdrs on the mass scale of young stars and the imf recently suggested by papadopoulos ( 2010 ) .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we confirm the high temperatures of dense gas cores in the extreme crdrs expected in ulirgs and all systems with large star formation rate densities ( @xmath145 ) , albeit at lower levels than the original study .",
    "these cr - induced higher gas temperatures will lead to @xmath610 times larger jeans masses across the entire density range typical in such regions , and thus higher charecteristic mass of young stars in the ism of galaxies with high @xmath145 .",
    "the crs , by decoupling the thermal state of the gas from that of the dust in crdrs keep @xmath15@xmath8@xmath9 for all densities typical of molecular clouds .",
    "this effectively `` erases '' the so called inflection point of the effective equation of state , especially in extreme crdrs , inevitably altering the fragmentation properties of the gas .",
    "this effect , along with the expected much higher gas ionization fractions , necessitates a search for a new eos , appropriate for crdrs .",
    "these new cr - induced ism conditions provide a new paradigm for all high - density star formation in the universe , with crs as the key sf feedback mechanism , operating unhindered by extinction even in the most dust - enshrouded starbursts .",
    "the resulting @xmath43-dependent imf , yields : a ) a natural bimodal behaviour for merger - driven / starburst versus disk / regular - sf galaxies , and b ) integrated galactic imfs ( igimfs ) that depend on their star formation history , both with important consequences in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "imf studies of stellar systems formed under extremely high @xmath165 values such as ultra compact dwarfs , and molecular line observations of the extreme crdrs in nearby ulirgs can provide the full picture of crdr properties and their effects on the imf . regarding the latter ,",
    "the now spaceborn herschel space observatory , and the upcoming alma hold particular promise .",
    "we would like to thank pavel kroupa for numerous useful conversations , especially regarding the imf of ucds , and joerg dabringhausen for pointing out his relevant work .",
    "we also thank andrew strong for discussing uncertainties regarding cr transport in dense molecular clouds , and the referee for comments regarding the cr energy densities and their effect on the imf of m82 . *",
