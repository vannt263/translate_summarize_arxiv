    "this work investigates the potential performance gains that can be obtained in a cellular network , by coordination or cooperative transmission between base stations ( bss ) .",
    "cooperation is particularly relevant for users located at the cell - edge , where significant @xmath0 gains can be achieved in the downlink . in the wireless literature",
    "there is a considerable amount of research on the topic , which relates to the concept of comp , network mimo @xcite , @xcite ( see also references therein ) , or c - ran .",
    "the various strategies proposed differ in the number of cooperating nodes , the type of signal cooperation , the amount of information exchange , and the way groups ( clusters ) are formed either dynamically or in a static way a - priori chosen .",
    "it is possible to analyse such cooperative networks by use of stochastic geometry .",
    "application of point processes to model the positions of wireless nodes gives the possibility to include the impact of irregularity of bs locations on the users performance ( e.g. @xmath0 , throughput , delay ) .",
    "furthermore , the gains from cooperation can be quantified in a systematic way , so that one need not test each different instance of network topology by simulations .",
    "closed formulas are very important for an operator that wants to plan and deploy an infrastructure with cooperation functionality , because these can provide intuition on the relative influence of various design parameters .",
    "there are considerable results available in this area . in @xcite , baccelli and giovanidis",
    "analyse the case where bss are modelled by a poisson point process ( ppp ) and each user - terminal triggers the cooperation of its two closest bss for its service .",
    "the authors show coverage improvements and an increase of the coverage cell . the work is extended in @xcite by nigam et al for larger size of clusters , showing that bs cooperation is more beneficial for the worst - case user .",
    "the @xmath0 experienced by a typical user when served by the @xmath1 strongest bss is also investigated by blaszczyszyn and keeler in @xcite , and the authors derive tractable integral expressions of the coverage probability for general fading by use of factorial moment measures .",
    "an analysis of a similar problem with use of laplace transforms ( lt ) is provided by tanbourgi et al in @xcite .",
    "all the above works assume that a user - terminal _ dynamically _ selects the set of stations that cooperate for its service .",
    "such an assumption is difficult to be applied in practice because the cluster formation should change with every different configuration of users .",
    "for this reason we propose here to group bss _ in a static way _ , so that clusters are a - priori defined and do not change over time .",
    "the appropriate static clustering should result in considerable performance benefits for the users , with a cost - effective infrastructure .",
    "in favour of the static grouping approach are other authors as well , like akoum and heath @xcite who randomly group bss around virtual centres , and guo et al who analyse in @xcite the coverage benefits of cooperation pairs modelled by a gauss - poisson point process .",
    "the existing static clustering models are not sufficient .",
    "they either group bss in a random way @xcite , or they randomly generate additional cluster nodes around a cluster center @xcite , which is translated in the physical world into installing randomly new nodes in the existing infrastructure .",
    "a more appropriate analysis should have a map of existing bs locations as the starting point , and from this define in a systematic way cooperation groups .",
    "the criterion for grouping should not be random , but rather node proximity , in order to limit the negative influence of first - order interference .",
    "for these reasons the authors propose in @xcite a grouping method based on a variation of the nearest neighbour model @xcite .",
    "the analysis was restricted to the case where only singles and pairs are allowed . having a ppp as a basis for the bs locations ,",
    "pairs are selected as the nodes that satisfy the _ mutually nearest neighbour relation _ , whereas the process of singles is formed by the remaining nodes .",
    "the analysis provided structural characteristics and expressions for the expectation and lt of the interference generated by each one of the two resulting processes .",
    "the processes of singles and pairs were shown not to be ppps , so the derivation of numerically tractable formulas for @xmath0 related metrics , as done in @xcite , is not evident . to find such formulas for the nearest neighbour cooperation we introduce , in section ii , an approximative model : the superposition of two independent ppps , equipped with structural characteristics of the original single and pair processes .",
    "potential signals emitted by the cooperative nodes , and their generalisation , are proposed in section iii .",
    "section iv analyses the interference in the superposition model .",
    "analysis of the coverage probability for two scenarios of user - to - bs association is provided in section v. the analytical formulas are validated through simulations and the gains of static nearest neighbour grouping are quantified .",
    "the final conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "_ proofs and supplementary material can be found in the arxiv version of the work , with the same title_.    note that our approach is general .",
    "it can be applied to many cooperation variations , ranging from simple coordination of the bss in group , to fully cooperative transmission using knowledge of the channel states .",
    "on @xmath2 we model the bs locations by a stationary ppp @xmath3 with density @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that a user - terminal is located at the cartesian origin @xmath5 and we examine the network performance at its position .",
    "this is the _ typical user approach_. we denote by @xmath6 the euclidean distance in @xmath2 .      in @xcite , starting from some given point process ( e.g. ppp ) the authors propose a grouping method of bss based on the nearest neighbour model @xcite .",
    "two bss belong to the same cooperating pair if each one of them is the nearest neighbour of the other ( * ? ? ?",
    "if a bs does not form a mutually nearest neighbour pair with any other bs from the process , it remains single ( * ? ? ?",
    "this is explained graphically in figure [ sinandpairs ] . in this way , @xmath3 splits into a process of single points and another one of the pairs .",
    "figure [ sinandpairs ] also displays an example of a poisson realisation , showing the singles and the pairs that can be formed .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it has been proven that , in accordance with the number @xmath9 , in average @xmath10 of bss are in pair and @xmath11 of bss are singles ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the processes of singles and pairs are not poisson .",

    "from now on , we refer to the previous model as the * nearest neighbour ( nn ) model*.    as a consequence of the non - poissonian behaviour , it is difficult to make a complete performance analysis for sinr related metrics .",
    "instead , we use in this work the following model to approximate these metrics .      to imitate the process of singles",
