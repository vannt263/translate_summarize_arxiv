    "zero - magnetic - field ( @xmath0 ) spin - splitting of energy bands has long been a subject of considerable experimental and theoretical effort because of its role in the electronic properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite .",
    "it concerns details of energy band structure that are of fundamental interest .",
    "the eigenstates in a system that has inversion symmetry in both space and time are spin - degenerate .",
    "if the system is made spatially inversion asymmetric , this degeneracy is lifted by spin - orbit interaction for all momentum @xmath1 , even in the absence of an external magnetic field . in 2d systems",
    ", we can create this spatial inversion asymmetry simply by making the potential which confines the carriers to 2d asymmetric .    in this work , we study the @xmath0 spin - splitting in gaas 2d holes confined to a quantum well ( qw ) grown on the ( 311)a surface of a gaas substrate .",
    "section [ sec : exper ] provides some experimental details . in section [ sec : spin ] , we show that by using two gates on the back and front of the sample to control the electric field applied perpendicular to the qw , the asymmetry and therefore the spin - splitting can be tuned while the carrier density is kept constant . in the process we discover that the low-@xmath2 shubnikov - de haas oscillations are not as simply related to the @xmath0 spin - splitting as has often been presumed @xcite .",
    "tuning the spin - splitting without changing the density allows us to isolate the effect of spin - splitting on various phenomena . in recent years",
    "there has been significant interest in the surprising metallic behavior of various high - quality 2d systems @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : mit_spinsp ] we show the effect of spin - splitting on the metallic behavior of the 2d holes in gaas @xcite .    finally , motivated by recent theoretical predictions @xcite",
    ", we have applied an in - plane @xmath2 to these samples and studied the magnetoresistance ( section [ sec : bpar ] ) .",
    "we have found that , remarkably , the in - plane @xmath2 depopulates the upper spin - subband at a rate which depends on the relative orientations of @xmath2 and the crystal axes ! this is a reflection of the anisotropic band structure and zeeman splitting in the system .",
    "furthermore , when the upper spin - subband is depopulated , the metallic behavior turns to insulating behavior .",
    "we also see an in - plane magnetoresistance anisotropy that depends on the relative orientations of @xmath2 and the current @xmath3 ; the finite layer thickness of our 2d system may be responsible for this observed anisotropy @xcite .",
    "a schematic cross section of our samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ sample]a .",
    "the samples are grown , via molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , on gaas ( 311)a substrates .",
    "each sample contains a 20 nm - wide gaas qw flanked by algaas barrier layers which are modulation doped with si .",
    "on gaas ( 311)a substrates , si is normally incorporated as an acceptor , leading to a high - quality 2d hole system in the gaas qw .",
    "we make ohmic contacts to the 2d holes using in : zn and alloying in a reducing atmosphere . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sample]a , our samples have back and front gates to change the density of the 2d hole system and also tune the symmetry of the confining qw potential .",
    "the back gate is made by contacting a layer of in left over on the back of the substrate from the mbe growth , and the front gate is evaporated metal ( ti - au ) .",
    "gaas 2d systems grown on ( 311)a substrates have an intrinsic mobility anisotropy due to an anisotropic interface roughness @xcite .",
    "the mobility for current along the @xmath4 $ ] direction can be up to several times the mobility for current along the @xmath5 $ ] direction . for this reason , we did our measurements on @xmath6-shaped hall bars , which allow simultaneous measurement of the resistivity @xmath7 for current along these two directions ( fig .",
    "[ sample]b ) .",
    "measurements were done in dilution and @xmath8he refrigerators , with base temperatures of 30 mk and 0.3 k respectively .",
    "the systems are fitted in a superconducting magnet capable of magnetic fields up to 16 t. the @xmath8he refrigerator has a tilting stage for the sample that can be rotated _ in - situ _ , so the relative angle between the magnetic field and 2d hole system plane can be varied .",
    "figure [ aniso ] shows an example of data for one of the samples from both mobility directions , measured simultaneously at 30 mk .",
    "the inset to a shows the low-@xmath2 data .",
    "the main part of a demonstrates the high quality of the sample .",
    "the inset to b shows raw @xmath9-dependence of @xmath7 data , and the main part of b shows it scaled to @xmath10 , the resistivity at 30 mk .",
    "we use the gates to tune the asymmetry of the qw by applying an electric field ( @xmath11 ) perpendicular to its plane .",
    "figure [ sample]c schematically demonstrates the procedure .",
    "we set the front gate ( @xmath12 ) and back gate ( @xmath13 ) voltages , and measure @xmath7 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "then , at a small @xmath2 , @xmath12 is increased and the change in the hole density is measured from the change in the hall coefficient .",
    "@xmath13 is then reduced to recover the original density",
    ". this procedure changes @xmath11 while maintaining the same density to within 3% , and allows calculation of the change in @xmath11 from the way the gates affect the density .",
    "these steps are repeated until we have probed the range of @xmath12 and @xmath13 that are accessible without causing gate leakage @xcite . increasing the magnitude of @xmath11 increases the asymmetry of the sample , which increases the spin - splitting .",
    "figure [ m340b1_33]a shows examples of the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations measured for current along the @xmath5 $ ] direction in our 20 nm qw , following the procedure described above to change @xmath11 from about 5 kv / cm ( pointing towards the front gate ) in the top panel through to about -6 kv / cm in the bottom panel .",

    "these frequencies have long been thought to be directly proportional to the spin - subband densities ( @xmath16 ) following @xcite : @xmath17 with this interpretation it is clear in fig . [ m340b1_33]b that we are tuning the spin - splitting through a minimum as we change @xmath11 from 5 kv / cm to -6 kv / cm : the two peaks , corresponding to two spin - subband densities , get closer together as @xmath11 approaches zero , finally merging , only to separate again as @xmath11 is decreased away from zero .",
    "below , we show that eq .",
    "1 is only approximately true .    in order to compare the theory of spin - splitting to the experimental results , we have performed self - consistent subband calculations that have no adjustable parameters ( further details are in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations produce , for a given 2d hole density and @xmath11 , both the @xmath0 spin - subband densities and the sdh oscillations .",
    "it is important to note that both of these results are produced by the same hamiltonian , so they are directly comparable .",
    "these calculations yield a surprising result : ffts of the calculated sdh oscillations show that the frequencies present , when converted to spin - subband densities using eq . 1 ,",
    "do _ not _ agree with the calculated @xmath0 spin - subband densities @xcite .",
    "this is highlighted in fig .",

    "the two @xmath19-axes of the figure are scaled by eq . 1 , so the sets of data can be directly compared .",
    "the calculated @xmath18 consistently underestimate the @xmath0 spin - splitting .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical and measured @xmath18 , however , is very good .",
    "especially noteworthy are the results for @xmath14 . as the @xmath0 calculations in fig .",
    "[ calc_exp ] indicate , even at @xmath20 , there should be finite spin - splitting because of the inversion asymmetry of the gaas ( zincblende ) crystal structure .",
    "however , both the measured and calculated ffts show only one peak for @xmath21 kv / cm @xcite .",
    "we believe that the inaccuracy of eq . 1 is due to a breakdown of onsager s argument @xcite , which is based on bohr - sommerfeld quantization of the semiclassical motion of the bloch carriers .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit interaction makes the system inherently quantum - mechanical , so a semiclassical picture fails .",
    "this finding is quite general in that one can expect deviations from a semiclassical picture for all systems with strong spin - orbit interaction",
    ". however , the full quantum - mechanical calculations predict that eq . 1 can be quite accurate for some 2d systems grown on high - symmetry crystal directions , while being inaccurate for other crystal directions or other systems @xcite .",
    "for many years , it was widely accepted that there can be no metallic phase in a 2d carrier system @xcite .",
    "however , recent experiments on several different high quality 2d systems have provided us with reason to re - visit this belief , as they showed that @xmath7 has a metallic - like temperature dependence : at very low temperatures @xmath7 decreases with decreasing @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms @xcite have been proposed to explain the metallic behavior , but no clear model has emerged which quantitatively describes the sizeable body of experimental data .    by tuning the spin - splitting at constant density",

    "[ m340b1_33]b . from this data",
    "it is evident that the magnitude of the change in @xmath7 from 30 mk to @xmath220.7 k is correlated with the spin - splitting .",

    "[ m340b1_33]c , we have calculated the @xmath0 spin - subband densities . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tdep_summ ] , data for these densities exhibit the same trend : @xmath23 is larger at larger @xmath29 , and @xmath23 is more sensitive to spin - splitting at the lower measured densities .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath7 for a density of @xmath30 @xmath26 has a qualitatively different shape from the higher - density data : it exhibits a local maximum . increasing @xmath29 moves this local maximum to lower @xmath9 .",
    "we note that previous experiments on the density - dependence of the metallic behavior show that at high densities @xmath7 monotonically increases with @xmath9 , and that as the density is reduced and the transition to insulating behavior is approached , a local maximum appears in @xmath7 vs. @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , in the density range we have measured , the effect of increasing spin - splitting on shape of @xmath7 vs. @xmath9 is similar to the effect of reducing density .",
    "for the highest density , @xmath28 @xmath26 , we have direct experimental support for the calculated @xmath24 . at the lower densities",
    "the sample quality is typically worse and the spin - splitting is too small so that two frequencies are not resolved in the sdh oscillations .",

    "however , a careful examination of all our data reveals that the changes in @xmath10 are not causing the changes in @xmath23 .",
    "the variation of @xmath23 due to @xmath11 does not correlate with the changes in @xmath10 .",

    "[ aniso]b .    in summary",
    ", we have found that in the density regime where @xmath7 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath9 , the magnitude of the change in @xmath7 , @xmath23 , is correlated with the spin - splitting of the 2d hole system .",
    "as the density is reduced , @xmath23 becomes larger and more sensitive to increased spin - splitting . in the density regime where @xmath7 has a local maximum , increasing the spin - splitting moves the maximum to lower @xmath9 .",
    "we also find that the direction of the current in the sample plays a surprising role : the higher - mobility direction shows a smaller @xmath23 .",
    "we also employed an in - plane magnetic field , using the tilting stage of the @xmath8he refrigerator , to probe the zeeman splitting in gaas 2d holes @xcite .",
    "similar magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements have been recently reported for 2d systems that exhibit a low-@xmath9 metallic behavior @xcite . in our measurements",
    "we have discovered a remarkable anisotropy in the effect of @xmath2 on the spin - subbands , pointing out that the zeeman splitting in this 2d system is very anisotropic .",
    "the measurements were done on a sample similar to those described above , but the densities were lower still .",
    "as with previous samples , we used both front and back gates to control the density . the longitudinal and hall mrs",
    "were first measured with a perpendicular @xmath2 , and then the sample was tilted 90@xmath32 and @xmath7 as a function of in - plane @xmath2 was measured .",
    "the measurements were made once with the sample mounted with the @xmath4 $ ] direction parallel to the tilt axis .",
    "then the sample was warmed up , re - mounted with the @xmath5 $ ] axis parallel to the tilt axis , and the measurements were repeated .",
    "note that this sample also had an @xmath6-shaped hall bar geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ sample]b , so for each orientation of the sample relative to the in - plane @xmath2 , @xmath7 was measured for both current directions simultaneously .    in order to make the data easier to track ,",
