    "a mechanical system of @xmath0 spherically symmetric particles is completely characterized by its so - called energy landscape , the graph of the potential energy function @xmath1 in @xmath2 dimensions . as suggested by goldstein in his pioneering 1969 paper @xcite ,",
    "the energy landscape is particularly useful for elucidating the dynamics of highly viscous liquids .",
    "this is because viscous liquid dynamics are dominated by jumps over barriers much larger than @xmath3 ; most time is spent on vibrations around local energy minima of the landscape .",
    "however , it was only after the work of stillinger and weber in the 1980 s @xcite and the enormous growth in use of computer simulations in the 1990 s that the energy landscape became a dominant paradigm in the study of viscous liquids @xcite",
    ". for recent reviews see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a complex high - dimensional landscape , but an obvious idea is to assume that there is an element of randomness in the landscape . in this philosophy",
    "one follows wolynes , who argued that some phenomena occurring in a specific complex system are typical of those that occur in most systems chosen randomly out of an ensemble of possible systems @xcite .",
    "a possible disordered landscape consists of a high - dimensional lattice with random , uncorrelated energies chosen , e.g. , according to a gaussian , with nearest - neighbor metropolis dynamics .",
    "this model , which has trivial thermodynamics , has been shown to reproduce a number of observed properties of viscous liquids , and the low - temperature dynamics of the model are understood to be dominated by site percolation @xcite .",
    "however , the model does not have a meaningful thermodynamic limit ; if the distribution of energies is chosen such that the mean energy is extensive , the relaxation times are not intensive .",
    "the problem , of course , is that a single nearest neighbor jump on the lattice changes the energy by an extensive amount , effectively corresponding to a complete rearrangement of all molecules .",
    "another problem is how dimensionality is reflected in the energy landscape .",
    "many condensed matter systems behave differently in two and three dimensions .",
    "if this applies also for viscous liquids , it must somehow be reflected in the landscape .",
    "the question we consider here is : is it possible to construct a sensible generic random landscape model ?",
    "such a model should obey the following requirements :    1 .",
    "it should have a well - defined thermodynamic limit , i.e. , extensive average energy and intensive relaxation times .",
    "2 .   it should reflect the dimensionality of space .",
    "3 .   all sites should be statistically equivalent , thereby ensuring translational invariance on the average .",
    "the energy landscape is attractive because it abstracts from three dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to suggest that the simplest way to have a model obeying the requirements listed above is to return to three dimensions :    consider a lattice gas in three dimensions .",
    "if random energies are assigned to the lattice sites , the system is described by fermi statistics .",
    "this corresponds to particles in an external random potential , thus with no translational invariance and only the trivial self exclusion particle - particle interaction .",
    "a simple modification turns this model into a highly nontrivial model , namely to assume that each particle has its own energy landscape , i.e. , the energy of the system is given by ( where @xmath4 is the lattice position of particle @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the dirac @xmath6-function ) : @xmath7    the first term is the energetic interaction ; for each lattice site , @xmath8 , and each particle , @xmath5 , the energy , @xmath9 , is chosen randomly from a probability distribution , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath11 are generally different random numbers if @xmath12 , i.e. , particles have different energy landscapes .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is the self exclusion particle - particle interaction ; no more than one particle is allowed at each lattice site .",
    "now all lattice sites are _ statistically _ equivalent .",
    "the model allows calculation of pressure and chemical potential , and has extensive thermodynamics and intensive relaxation times .",
    "in particular we expect that at high densities , @xmath13 , there will be a jamming effect slowing down the dynamics considerably .",
    "when comparing the simulation results of this model to results from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , one should keep in mind that the model does not include the high frequency vibrations associated with `` cage - rattling '' .",
    "the dynamics that are modeled here are the so called `` inherent dynamics '' @xcite , i.e. , the result of mapping the true dynamics onto a series of inherent structures ( local minima in the @xmath14 dimensional energy landscape ) .",
    "we make the simplest possible choice for the probability distribution @xmath10 : the box distribution [ @xmath15 . in this case the mean system energy per particle is easily found to be ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 at low temperatures , we thus get @xmath18 .",
    "the model was simulated on a three dimensional @xmath19 cubic lattice using the n - fold way kinetic monte carlo method @xcite with continuous time .",
    "we use metropolis transition rates with local monte carlo moves ; if a particle jumping to a nearest - neighbor site brings the system from state @xmath5 to state @xmath20 , the associated transition rate is given by : @xmath21\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our length and time units are defined by setting the lattice unit @xmath22 , and the fastest transition rate @xmath23 .",
    "since each particle has its own energy landscape , the number of different site energies are given by @xmath24 .",
    "storing these numbers in memory would put a severe constraint on how large systems we could simulate .",
    "instead we utilize the ran4 random number generator @xcite in the following way : each particle is assigned a particle - seed , and when needed this is used together with the appropriate site - index as input to ran4 , which performs a series of bit operations to produce a uniform random deviate in the range @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "the simulations are carried out with two sets of periodic boundary conditions , one for each term in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the lattice length associated with the particle - particle interactions .",
    "the usage of ran4 makes it possible to use much larger energy landscapes : the lattice site index used as input to ran4 is a 32-bit integer , and for the energy landscapes we can therefore use a side - length of approximately @xmath28 ( we use @xmath27 times an integer ) , i.e. for all practical purposes ( at least in this paper ) each particle has an energy landscape that is infinite .",
    "as mentioned above , we impose locality on the monte carlo moves ; particles can only jump to ( vacant ) nearest - neighbor sites . relaxing this requirement",
    "( letting a monte carlo move consist of a random particle interchange with a random particle / hole ) gives us an efficient way to equilibrate the model : for all the state points investigated here the characteristic time for equilibration was found to be less than @xmath29 time units .",
    "equilibration runs were done for a time period of @xmath28 time units .",
    "two densities were simulated , each at a range of @xmath30-values , see table [ tab : statepoints ] .",
    "our simulations agree with the analytical expression for the mean energy ( equation [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "reported results are averages over 8 independent simulations ( 8 different energy landscapes ) , and error - bars are estimated from fluctuations between these 8 simulations .",
    "[ fig : r2 ] shows the mean - square displacement , @xmath31 , in a log - log plot .",
    "these results look similar to what is found in md simulations of viscous liquids ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) : at long times the dynamics is diffusive ( @xmath32 ) , and this diffusive regime is preceded by a plateau that develops as the system is cooled . in md simulations",
    "this developing plateau is attributed to `` cage rattling '' : particles vibrating in a cage consisting of the nearest neighbors . in this",
    "regime particles move considerably less than the inter - particle distance .",
    "this `` md scenario '' is obviously _ not _ what happens in this model ; as discussed above the vibrations on length scales shorter than the inter - particle distance are not included in the model . here",
    "the developing of a plateau means that after a particle has jumped to a nearest - neighbor site , the probability for jumping back to where it came from is ( on average ) larger than the probability for jumping to a new lattice site .",
    "this leads to a slowing down of the dynamics compared to diffusion dynamics .",
    "only when particles have jumped several times is this correlation between jumps lost whereupon the dynamics become diffusive . at short times ( @xmath33 ) a regime with @xmath32",
    "is seen - this is simply a consequence of the time scale being so short that particles never jump more than once .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcoeff]a we report the diffusion coefficients extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig : r2 ] . for reference",
    "we show here also results for the @xmath34 limit , i.e. , simulations with non - interacting particles ( in this limit the model is obviously not a good model of a liquid ) . in the @xmath34 limit",
    "we find arrhenius behavior [ @xmath35 , as expected from percolation arguments @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the higher densities show distinctive non - arrhenius behavior ; the model exhibits `` fragile '' behavior . to facilitate comparison with angell s fragility plot @xcite",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcoeff]b the diffusion coefficients scaled in the following way : the y - axis is scaled with the diffusion coefficient at infinite temperature , @xmath36 ( which scales with @xmath37 @xcite ) , and the x - axis is scaled with an `` inverse glass temperature '' , @xmath38 , which is here defined by the scaled diffusion coefficients being identical at @xmath39 ( and @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) . the degree of fragility is observed to increase with increasing density ( decreasing @xmath37 ) .",
    "[ fig : ea ] shows the apparent activation energy , obtained by regarding @xmath42 in the arrhenius expression as being temperature dependent : @xmath43 in the @xmath34 limit @xmath42 as expected approaches the theoretical value , @xmath44 @xcite . at high densities",
    ", @xmath42 keeps increasing above this value , reflecting the non - arrhenius behavior .",
    "there is an indication ( particularly for @xmath45 ) that @xmath42 might be leveling of to a constant , indicating that there might be a crossover from non - arrhenius to arrhenius behavior , as seen e.g. in simulations of viscous silica @xcite .",
    "the observed indication of a crossover to arrhenius behavior might be related to `` hitting the bottom '' of the energy landscape , but this point deserves further investigations .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0 ] we show the self part of the density auto - correlation , @xmath46 @xcite , i.e. , the probability that a particle at time @xmath47 is at the same site as it was at time @xmath48 .",
    "dashed lines are fits to stretched exponentials : @xmath49 the fits are not perfect , but they capture the main characteristics of the data .",
    "the fitting parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0fitparam ] . as for the diffusion constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcoeff ] ) , the relaxation time @xmath50 exhibits non - arrhenius behavior with an indication of a crossover to arrhenius behavior at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the stretching exponent @xmath51 decreases with @xmath30 , indicating an increasing degree of non - exponential relaxation . except for the lowest temperature at each density",
    ", the stretching exponent @xmath51 seems to level off to a constant close to @xmath52 .",
    "a constant stretching exponent indicates time - temperature superposition ( tts ) , i.e. , that the shape of the relaxation function is independent of temperature .",
    "we note that this behavior is consistent with experiments indicating that tts is correlated to @xmath53 @xcite . here",
    "we find at the very lowest temperatures an indication that the stretching exponent starts to increase again , which might be related to the apparent cross - over from arrhenius to non - arrhenius behavior discussed earlier .",
    "simulations at lower temperatures are needed to investigate this question further .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : r2 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : p0]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : p0]b , one might ask : `` why does a plateau develop in @xmath31 and not in @xmath46 ? '' . the answer is , that there is indeed a plateau developing in @xmath46 - this can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : p0]c , where we have plotted @xmath54 ( i.e. the fraction of particles that are contributing to @xmath31 ) in a log - log plot .",
    "in fact , at short times where no particle jumps more than once @xmath55 . at the lowest temperature in fig . [",
    "fig : p0]c this relation holds to within @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath58 limit at low temperatures @xmath46 looks quantitatively different from what is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0 ] : there is a strong initial relaxation ( related to jumps with @xmath59 ) , a stronger stretching ( @xmath60 ) , and a final pronounced power law regime that starts at @xmath61 .",
    "this limit ( which we again stress is not a good model for a liquid ) is investigated in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "it is well established that viscous liquids contain dynamical heterogeneities , i.e. , if subsets of particles are defined by their dynamical properties , these tend to be correlated in time and/or space @xcite . figure [ fig : dynhet ] indicates in a qualitative way that the model exhibits dynamical heterogeneity to an increasing degree as temperature is lowered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynhet ] we show the displacement of particles at a time where @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the fraction of particles contributing to the mean square displacement ( i.e. @xmath66 ) is smaller at the low temperature ( see also table [ tab : dynhet ] ) , and that the positions of contributing particles are correlated in space .",
