    "the existence of an inflationary stage during the evolution of the early universe is usually invoked to solve the flatness and the horizon problems of the standard big bang cosmology @xcite . during inflation",
    "the energy density is dominated by vacuum energy and comoving scales undergo quasi - exponential growth . as a result",
    ", any undesirable topological defects left as remnants after some grand unified phase transition , such as monopoles , are diluted .",
    "typically , the vacuum energy driving inflation is generated by a scalar field @xmath0 ( the `` inflaton '' ) displaced from the minimum of a potential @xmath1 .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field imprint a nearly scale invariant spectrum of fluctuations on the background space - time metric .",
    "these fluctuations may be responsible for the generation of structure formation .",
    "however , the level of density and temperature fluctuations observed in the present universe , @xmath2 , require the inflaton potential to be extremely flat .",
    "for instance , in the chaotic inflationary scenario @xcite where the inflaton potential is @xmath3 and the scalar field sits initially at scales of order of the planck scale , the dimensionless self - coupling @xmath4 must be of order of @xmath5 to be consistent with observations .",
    "the inflaton field must be coupled to other fields in order to ensure the conversion of the vacuum energy into radiation at the end of inflation , but these couplings must be very small , otherwise loop corrections to the inflaton potential spoil its flatness . while the necessity of introducing very small parameters to ensure the extreme flatness of the inflaton potential seems very unnatural and fine - tuned in most non - supersymmetric theories , this technical naturalness may be achieved in supersymmetric models @xcite because the nonrenormalization theorem guarantees that the superpotential is not renormalized to all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , even though the form of the potential may be stable when the inflaton couples to other fields , initial small couplings @xmath4 must still be put by hand , an aesthetically unpleasant option .",
    "a natural way to solve this problem is to interpret small couplings as a ratio of different mass scales .",
    "this is the underlying idea of hybrid inflation @xcite where two ( or more ) interacting fields are associated with different scales and inflation ends by a rapid rolling of a second field @xmath6 , initially sitting at the origin and triggered by the slow rolling of the field @xmath0 . during the inflationary stage the inflaton potential is typically given by @xmath7 and the smallness of the density perturbations may be easily explained by the hierarchy .",
    "successful supersymmetric versions of hybrid inflation have been constructed in the framework of global supersymmetry @xcite and , more recently , in supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry can therefore play a fundamental role during inflation @xcite .    in our discussion of inflation below we will concern ourselves with a potential of the form : @xmath8 where the index @xmath9 and the scale @xmath10 depend upon the underlying gauge group .",
    "such a potential might at first seem peculiar since it involves a field ( or more than one field ) appearing in the denominator . however , such potentials are known to arise generically in supersymmetric theories .",
    "this fact has been known for some time @xcite , and has gained increasing attention of late after the recent work on understanding the non - perturbative behavior of supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the unconventional term involving fields in the denominator typically arises due to non - perturbative effects that lift various flat directions in supersymmetric theories .",
    "such non - perturbative effects might have to do with instanton effects or , for example , with gaugino condensation associated with some unbroken non - abelian gauge group .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that regardless of exactly how the potential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) arises , in our discussion of inflation we will be working in the region where the field(s ) involved have large enough vacuum expectation values that their presence in the denominator does not cause any singular behavior . in this regime",
    "the theory is weakly coupled and corrections to the canonical kahler potential are negligible .",
    "we will not be concerned , in this paper , with the the detailed dynamics which gives rise to the potential in eq .",
    "this is in large part because our conclusions are quite insensitive to most details of the potential and follow mainly from the _ general _ form of eq .",
    "it is of course interesting to ask whether the inflationary scenario envisaged in this paper can be actually realized in a reasonably simple supersymmetric model .",
    "it has been suggested , for example in models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , that non - perturbative effects , driven by instanton effects or gaugino condensation , might be responsible for the dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( dsb ) when the classical moduli space is lifted in the potential and scalar fields are driven to large expectation values .",
    "additional tree level interactions in the potential may raise the potential at large expectation values leading to a stable ground state .",
    "if some @xmath11-terms ( and the potential ) do not vanish in such a ground state , supersymmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "recent developments have also shown that many supersymmetric theories may have other types of non - perturbative dynamics which lead to degenerate quantum moduli spaces of vacuum instead of dynamically generated superpotentials .",
    "this makes it tempting to speculate ( although it is not necessary for the discussion of inflation proposed in this paper ) that the potential above , responsible for inflation , could also arise from the same underlying dynamics responsible for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we will not pursue these ideas any further here and leave them for future study .",
    "we only note in passing that the term in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) is not usually the only one present in the potential .",
    "other terms may be present and lift up the flat direction .",
    "if these terms are small enough , the vacuum expectation value of the field is finite , but nevertheless all the interesting dynamics of inflation happens when the term ( [ pot ] ) dominates .",
    "this comes out naturally if these other terms are nonrenormalizable , which is plausible in many dsb models .",
    "moreover , following the philosophy of such models , it is likely that nonrenormalizable terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath12 , the only explicit scale allowed in the theory .",
    "the last key ingredient of our proposal is that during inflation , the energy density is dominated by a a nonzero constant vacuum energy density @xmath13 ( this always happens if the value of the inflaton field is _ large _ enough ) . in the absence of any other physics , the inflaton field rolls down to its vev and inflation never ends .",
    "however , the inflaton may be coupled to some fields in some other sector of the theory in such away that , when @xmath0 gets larger than some critical value @xmath14 , @xmath13 drops to zero .",
    "this is the usual way inflation is terminated in hybrid inflation .",
    "what is remarkable is that this vacuum energy density @xmath13 may be identified with some scale @xmath15 which appears in models where quantum deformation of a classical moduli space plays a fundamental role .",
    "a typical example is provided by the chiral @xmath16 model in the limit in which the scale associated to @xmath17 is much higher than the one associated to @xmath18 .",
    "here we are assuming that the scale @xmath13 is only present during the inflationary stage and relaxes to zero to opportunely end inflation .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new class of inflationary models inspired by the typical structure of the potential generated by some non - perturbative gauge dynamics",
    ". we will denote this class of models by dynamical supersymmetric inflation ( dsi ) .",
    "we will show that a successful inflationary scenario may be constructed and that the generation of density perturbations may be accounted for in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "more interestingly , a blue spectrum of density perturbations is predicted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ( [ secinflationreview ] ) is a short review of inflationary cosmology from scalar field theories . section ( [ secinflationcalc ] ) contains the details of limiting the parameters of the model from observations of cmb fluctuations .",
    "finally , section ( [ secconclusions ] ) contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we quickly review scalar field models of inflationary cosmology , and explain how we relate model parameters to observable quantities .",
    "( for more detailed reviews , see refs .",

    "inflation _ is defined to be a period of accelerated expansion , @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor can be written as @xmath25 , where the number of e - folds @xmath26 is defined in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath27 as @xmath28 during inflation @xmath27 , and therefore the horizon size @xmath29 , is nearly constant , and the expansion of the universe is quasi - exponential .",
    "this results in the curious behavior that the coordinate system is expanding faster than the light traveling in it , and comoving length scales rapidly increase in size relative to the horizon distance .",
    "regions initially in causal contact are `` redshifted '' to large , non - causal scales , explaining the observed isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on large angular scales .",
    "this is also important for the generation of metric fluctuations in inflation , discussed below .",
    "finally , a universe which starts out with a nonzero curvature evolves rapidly during inflation toward zero curvature and a flat robertson - walker metric .",
    "stress - energy conservation gives the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath30 the _ slow - roll _ approximation@xcite is the assumption that the evolution of the field is dominated by drag from the cosmological expansion , so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 the equation of state of the scalar field is then dominated by the potential , so that @xmath33 , and the expansion rate is approximately @xmath34 the slow - roll approximation is consistent if both the slope and curvature of the potential are small .",
    "this condition is conventionally expressed in terms of the `` slow - roll parameters '' @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38.\\ ] ] slow - roll is then a consistent approximation for @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 can be shown to directly parameterize the equation of state of the scalar field , @xmath40 , so that the condition for inflation @xmath24 is _ exactly _ equivalent to @xmath41 .",
    "the number of e - folds @xmath26 of inflation as the field evolves from @xmath42 to @xmath43 can be expressed in terms of @xmath35 as @xmath44 to match the observed degree of flatness and homogeneity in the universe , we require many e - folds of inflation , typically @xmath45 .",
    "( this figure varies somewhat with the details of the model . )",
    "inflation not only explains the high degree of large - scale homogeneity in the universe , but also provides a mechanism for explaining the observed _ inhomogeneity _ as well . during inflation , quantum fluctuations on small scales",
    "are quickly redshifted to scales much larger than the horizon size , where they are `` frozen '' as perturbations in the background metric@xcite .",
    "metric perturbations at the surface of last scattering are observable as temperature anisotropy in the cmb , which was first detected by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite .",
    "the metric perturbations created during inflation are of two types : scalar , or _ curvature _",
    "perturbations , which couple to the stress - energy of matter in the universe and form the `` seeds '' for structure formation , and tensor , or gravitational wave perturbations , which do not couple to matter . both scalar and tensor perturbations",
    "contribute to cmb anisotropy .",
    "scalar fluctuations can also be interpreted as fluctuations in the density of the matter in the universe .",
    "scalar fluctuations can be quantitatively characterized by perturbations @xmath46 in the intrinsic curvature@xcite @xmath47 the fluctuation power is in general a function of wavenumber @xmath48 , and is evaluated when a given mode crosses outside the horizon during inflation , @xmath49 . outside the horizon",

    "spectral index _",
    "@xmath50 is defined by assuming an approximately power - law form for @xmath46 with @xmath51 so that a scale - invariant spectrum , in which modes have constant amplitude at horizon crossing , is characterized by @xmath52 . instead of specifying the fluctuation amplitude directly as a function of @xmath48 ,",
    "it is often convenient to specify it as a function of the number of e - folds @xmath26 before the end of inflation at which a mode crossed outside the horizon .",
    "scales of interest for measurements of cmb anisotropy crossed outside the horizon at @xmath53 , so that @xmath46 is conventionally evaluated at @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , the power spectrum of tensor fluctuation modes is given by @xmath55 the ratio of tensor to scalar modes is @xmath56 , so that tensor modes are negligible for @xmath57 .",
    "if the contribution of tensor modes to the cmb anisotropy can be neglected , normalization to the cobe four - year data gives@xcite @xmath58 . calculating the cmb fluctuations from a particular inflationary model",

    "( 2 ) from @xmath35 , calculate @xmath26 as a function of the field @xmath0 . ( 3 ) invert @xmath59 to find @xmath60 . ( 4 ) calculate @xmath61 , @xmath50 , and @xmath62 as functions of @xmath0 , and evaluate at @xmath63 to determine the values of the observables at scales of current astrophysical interest .",
    "we take the potential to be described by a single degree of freedom @xmath0 , of the general form @xmath64 as we noted in the introduction , the presence of the nonrenormalizable term is not strictly necessary .",
    "we include it here for generality , and show that its presence , subject to certain consistency constraints , does not significantly affect our conclusions .",

    "this means that if the universe ever becomes vacuum dominated , it _ stays _ vacuum dominated , and inflation will continue indefinitely unless other physics is brought into play . here",
    "we will simply assume that some other sector of the theory ends inflation when @xmath0 passes through a critical value @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath14 near the vev @xmath66 , the potential can be expanded as @xmath68 this is just the case of standard hybrid inflation@xcite , which has been studied extensively in the literature .",

    "( [ eqepsilon ] ) is equal to unity , since that expression depends on the assumption of slow - roll .",
    "however , for @xmath80 , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are small and slow - roll is a consistent approximation",
    ". in the region @xmath81 , the second term in ( [ eqeta ] ) dominates , which is equivalent to @xmath82 , and @xmath36 can be written in the useful forms @xmath83 the number of e - folds @xmath26 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath14 is the critical value at which inflation ends .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is in general determined by a coupling of the field @xmath0 to some other sector of the theory which we have here left unspecified .",
    "accordingly , we will treat @xmath14 as simply a free parameter .",
    "noting from eq.([eqformsofeta ] ) that @xmath85 , for @xmath86 the number of e - folds @xmath26 approaches a constant , which we call @xmath87 , @xmath88 this is quite an unusual feature .",
    "most models of inflation have no intrinsic upper limit on the total amount of expansion that takes place during the inflationary phase , although only the last @xmath89 or @xmath90 e - folds are of direct observational significance . here",
    "the total amount of inflation is bounded from above , although that upper bound can in principle be very large . defining @xmath91 to be the field value @xmath26 e - folds before the end of inflation ,",
    "we can then write @xmath92 in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath87 as @xmath93 so that @xmath36 approaches a constant value for @xmath94 . the magnitude of scalar metric perturbations is given by the curvature power spectrum @xmath46 , @xmath95 the cobe normalization is @xcite @xmath58 , with spectral index @xmath96 as announced , the spectrum turns out to be blue , but for @xmath97 the spectrum approaches scale - invariance , @xmath98 . if we take the example case of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the cobe constraint on @xmath46 is met for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , very natural values for the fundamental scales in the theory . since @xmath103 , tensor modes produced during inflation are of negligible amplitude , a typical feature of hybrid inflation models .    in this class of models ,",
    "a nearly scale - invariant spectrum @xmath104 is the most natural case .",
    "significantly blue spectra , @xmath105 , are , however , not excluded and can occur for properly tuned values of the fundamental scales in the theory .",
    "the condition for significant deviation from a scale - invariant spectrum is that @xmath87 not be much greater than @xmath89 .",
    "we can write @xmath87 as a function of the scalar spectral index @xmath106 so , again taking @xmath99 , a spectral index of @xmath107 requires @xmath108 .",
    "such a small amount of inflation could have observationally important consequences@xcite .",
    "we have two observationally determined constraints , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and _ three _ free parameters in the model , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , and @xmath111 . then fixing the spectral index @xmath50 and varying @xmath14 results in a contour in the @xmath112 plane .",
    "in addition , we have two consistency constraints : first that the dynamics of the field are dominated by the @xmath70 term , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath113^{1/(p + q + 4)},\\ ] ] and second that the vacuum energy is dominated by the constant @xmath114 , which can be expressed as @xmath115 fig 1 .",
    "shows constant @xmath50 contours in the @xmath112 plane for an ensemble of distinct cases .",
    "the interesting feature of this plot is that the cobe limits on the fundamental parameters of the model are relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath9 and @xmath116 , and hence on the details of the underlying physical theory .",
    "further , if future observations find a spectrum of density fluctuations which detectably deviates from the @xmath52 scale - invariant case , this will significantly constrain the range of allowed parameters .",
    "of particular note is that all of the fundamental mass scales are significantly below the planck scale , @xmath117 .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the presence of nonrenormalizable terms in the lagrangian does not significantly affect our conclusions , so that the scenario is quite robust .",
    "a generic feature of models of nonperturbative gauge dynamics in supersymmetry is the presence of a `` scalar field '' potential of the form @xmath118 where the field @xmath0 is in general a label for a condensate . in this paper",
    ", we consider this general form of a scalar field potential in the context of inflationary cosmology , and find that an inflationary phase in the very early universe is a generic and natural characteristic , for example , of dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we call this class of inflationary models `` dynamical supersymmetric inflation ( dsi ) . '' like models of hybrid inflation , these models are characterized by a potential dominated by a constant term @xmath13 , and require coupling to another sector to end inflation when @xmath0 reaches a critical value @xmath14 . unlike standard hybrid inflation models , models of this type postulate a field far from the minimum of the potential , @xmath119",
    ".    the primary observational constraint on models of inflation comes from the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite , which measured fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background of magnitude @xmath120 , with a spectral index @xmath121 . the small fluctuation amplitude , which requires fine - tuned dimensionless parameters in typical inflation models , appears naturally here as a ratio of fundamental scales , e.g. @xmath101 and @xmath122 .",
    "we do not pursue here the idea that the potential responsible for inflation could also arise from the same underlying dynamics responsible for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is , however , intriguing to notice that the scales @xmath123 and @xmath10 turn out to be of the right order of magnitude to explain supersymmetric particle masses in the tev range in the supergravity and gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios , respectively .",
    "dsi is characterized by a `` blue '' spectral index , @xmath105 .",
    "a nearly scale - invariant spectrum @xmath98 is the most natural outcome , but significantly blue spectra can occur for reasonable values of the parameters .",
    "the addition of nonrenormalizable terms suppressed by powers of the planck mass , @xmath124 does not significantly alter the inflationary properties of the potential .",
    "models of cosmological inflation based on dynamical supersymmetry breaking are not only well motivated from a particle physics standpoint , but also very naturally meet constraints from observations of the cmb .",
    "these models have the unusual characteristic of possessing an _ upper limit _ on the total amount of inflation , as well as the attractive feature of predicting a `` blue '' spectrum of density fluctuations .",
