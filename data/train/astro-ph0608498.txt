    "several lines of evidence indicate that the progenitors of short - duration , hard - spectrum gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are related to an old stellar population .",
    "these include the localization of grb050724 @xcite , and most likely grb050509b @xcite , to bright elliptical galaxies , the lack of supernova emission in several low redshift short grbs @xcite , and the location of grb050709 outside of any star forming region in its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "while this supports the popular notion that the progenitors are compact objects binaries ( dns or ns - bh ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the lack of direct observations ( e.g. , gravitational waves or a sub - relativistic , radioactive component : @xcite ) , suggests that a more detailed understanding of the progenitor population has to rely on statistical studies .    in this vein ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that the redshift and luminosity distributions of  and batse short grbs , are inconsistent with the nominal merger time distribution of dns binaries in the milky way , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "they further conclude that the typical age of the progenitors is old , @xmath20 gyr @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite propose that the relative fractions of short grbs in early- and late - type galaxies should constrain the progenitor lifetime distribution .",
    "this test derives from the fact that , on average , stars in early - type galaxies form earlier than in late - type galaxies .    an an extension of this idea , the preponderance of short grbs in galaxy clusters can also be used to constrain the age distribution and nature of the progenitor population . in the framework of @xmath21cdm cosmology ,",
    "high - resolution numerical simulations suggest that the oldest stars reside in dense galaxy cluster environments , typically within @xmath22 kpc of the cluster center @xcite .",
    "this is supported by observations , which indicate that the difference in formation epochs for stars in cluster and field ellipticals is @xmath23 gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath24 * in clusters is larger than in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this leads to an even more pronounced difference in star formation history than just the difference between early- and late - type galaxies discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the early - type fraction in clusters , @xmath25 , is twice as high as in the field @xcite , suggesting that the fraction of short grbs in clusters is intimately related to their rate in early - type galaxies .",
    "this is of particular importance in cases where the positional accuracy of the burst is not sufficient to associate it with a particular galaxy , but may be sufficient to associate it with a galaxy cluster .",
    "finally , the specific frequency of globular clusters is at least a factor of a few higher in bright cluster ellipticals than in field galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the fraction of short bursts in galaxy clusters may shed light on whether globular clusters are an efficient site for the formation of short grb progenitors , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "a complete search for clusters is also important from an observational point of view .",
    "these associations can be made at high significance based on the prompt @xmath26-ray positions alone ( typically , @xmath27 ) , whereas associations with individual galaxies require accurate positions ( @xmath28 ) from the optical , radio , or x - ray afterglow .",
    "since the afterglow brightness correlates with the circumburst density the latter approach may produce an observational bias in favor of gas - rich or disk galaxies .    to date , three associations of short grbs with galaxy clusters have been claimed .",
    "grb050509b appears to reside in the cluster zwcl 1234.0 + 02916 at @xmath29 @xcite , grb050813 is apparently associated with a cluster at @xmath30 ( @xcite ; gladders et al . in prep . ) , and grb790613 may be associated with the cluster abell 1892 at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the statistical significance of these associations is @xmath32 .    motivated by these considerations we began the first systematic search for galaxy clusters hosting short grbs , using multi - slit optical spectroscopy and archival x - ray observations",
    "this is part of a long - term program to constrain the age distribution of the progenitors using the properties of their large - scale environments . here",
    "we present spectroscopy in the fields of grbs 050709 , 050724 , 050911 , and 051221a .",
    "we also re - analyze all of the available x - ray observations of short grb fields to search for diffuse emission from hot intracluster gas associated with potential clusters .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the optical observations are described in  [",
    "sec : spec ] , and the x - ray analysis in presented in  [ sec : xray ] . in ",
    "[ sec : res ] we summarize the results of our search , including a determination of the optical and x - ray properties of the cluster edcc 493 , which coincides with grb050911 .",
    "we draw initial conclusions in  [ sec : disc ] . throughout the paper",
    "we use the standard @xmath21cdm cosmology with @xmath33 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the four bursts studied in this paper we refer the reader to the following publications .",

    "formally , @xmath36 for this burst is @xmath37 s @xcite , but the light curve is dominated by an initial pair of short pulses with a total duration of about 1.5 s , followed by a softer component with a slow rise and decay .",
    "the latter component may be similar to the soft tails observed in grbs 050709 @xcite and 050724 @xcite , and moreover would have been missed by batse @xcite . in this framework ,  would be classified as a short grb .",

    "a possible background galaxy group or cluster is located at @xmath58 , but we do not detect any coincident x - ray emission with a limit of @xmath59 erg s@xmath2 ( at @xmath12 ) .",
    "this indicates that this background structure is at most a poor cluster .",
    "similarly , of the 21 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the @xmath60 field of grb050709 , we find only two within @xmath61 km s@xmath2 of the burst redshift , @xmath62 .",
    "this is unlikely to constitute a significant structure , and in fact we place a limit of @xmath63 erg s@xmath2 on diffuse x - ray emission associated with the burst environment .    in the field of grb051221a",
    "we find a nearly uniform redshift distribution between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with only two galaxies in the @xmath66 field located within 2000 km s@xmath2 of the burst redshift , @xmath67 .",
    "however , these galaxies , at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are situated about @xmath70 ( 1.2 mpc ) and @xmath71 ( 1.1 mpc ) away from the grb host galaxy , respectively , suggesting that this is not likely to be a significantly overdense structure .",
    "the limit on diffuse x - ray emission coincident with the burst position is @xmath72 erg s@xmath2 , or about @xmath73 fainter than the x - ray luminosity of the cluster associated with grb050509b ( @xcite ; table  [ tab : xray ] ) .",

    "we estimate the cluster velocity dispersion using the rostat package @xcite .",
    "we consider all galaxies within @xmath77 km s@xmath2 of the mean cluster redshift , and calculate the biweight estimators of the location ( mean velocity ) and scale ( velocity dispersion )",
    ". objects with velocities greater than three times the velocity dispersion are removed from the sample and a new location and scale are calculated iteratively until no more objects are clipped . in this particular system , no objects were clipped from the original list .",
    "we find @xmath78 km s@xmath2 and a redshift of @xmath0 ( figure  [ fig : grbsz ] ) .",
    "the early - type fraction in our sample of fourteen cluster members is @xmath79 , at the high end of the distribution for groups / clusters with a similar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "this suggests that  was most likely associated with an early - type galaxy .",
    "another potential implication is that edcc 493 is more evolved than a typical cluster of the same mass , perhaps a reflection of the old age of the grb progenitor system . the determination of the early - type fraction for a larger sample of cluster members will show whether this effect is real .",
    "we also detect diffuse x - ray emission in the xrt data coincident with the optical cluster position , at @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( j2000 ) , with an uncertainty of about @xmath80 in each coordinate ( figure  [ fig:050911xray ] ) .",
    "this position is @xmath81 west and @xmath82 south of the optical position of the bright cluster elliptical .    to determine the source x - ray properties we extract counts for each individual observation in an elliptical aperture with semi - major and semi - minor axes of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , selected to match the scale at which the cluster diffuse emission matches the background level .",
    "we then bin the extracted counts in energy such that each bin contains at least ten counts . using a mekal model fit to the energy range of @xmath54 kev with an abundance fixed at @xmath85 z@xmath6 @xcite and an absorbing column density of @xmath86 @xmath10 @xmath10 @xcite , we find @xmath87 kev , and @xmath88 erg s@xmath2 ( @xmath89 for 19 degrees of freedom ) .",

    ", this fraction is in rough agreement with the value of @xmath140 for the overall fraction of stellar mass in galaxy clusters @xcite , or roughly @xmath13 in clusters equal to or more massive than edcc 493 @xcite . of course , not all stars are capable of producing short grbs , but assuming that the initial mass function and binary fractions are independent of galaxy properties , the total stellar mass provides a good proxy for the mass in short grb progenitors .",
    "thus , at the present there is reasonable agreement between the fraction of short grbs and the baseline fraction of stellar mass in galaxy clusters .",
    "finally , we note that the frequency of short grbs in galaxy clusters may reflect a potential association with globular clusters .",
    "the latter are thought to provide an efficient environment for the production of dns binaries , and may account for a substantial fraction of all short grb progenitors @xcite . in particular , the specific frequency of globular clusters increases significantly from a value of @xmath141 for s+irr galaxies to @xmath142 for e+s0 galaxies , and @xmath143 for cd galaxies @xcite . given that massive ellipticals are over - represented in galaxy clusters compared to the field , we expect that an association with globular clusters will increase the fraction of galaxy cluster associations compared to the baseline level of @xmath144 indicated above .",
    "thus , continued searches for galaxy clusters hosting short grbs , and more detailed predictions for the expected fraction as a function of cluster mass and redshift , may hold the key to a clearer understanding of the progenitor population .",
