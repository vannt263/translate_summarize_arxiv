    "the standard cosmology is put into a great challenge by exciting observational evidences @xcite in the last decade . to incorporate the present accelerating phase of the universe within the frame work of einstein gravity , it is inevitable to introduce a non - gravitating type of matter with hugely negative pressure ( of the order of its energy density ) called dark energy ( de ) . for the mysterious de , there are only very few constraints on its form of an equation of state @xcite .",
    "the general and leading choice of the unknown de is the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 model ) which represents a vacuum energy density having constant equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "however , its observed value is far below than the estimation from quantum field theory ( known as cosmological constant problem ) .",
    "also there is no explanation why the constant vacuum energy and matter energy densities are precisely of the same order at present epoch ( known as coincidence problem ) . due to",
    "both theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite problems related to cosmological constant other de models ( varies with time ) are used in the literature .",
    "scalar field models @xcite ( commonly known as quintessence ) have attracted special attention compare to other alternatives @xcite",
    ". + at present de and cold dark matter ( hereafter called as dm ) are dominant sources ( about 70 percent of de and 25 percent of dm ) of the content of the universe .",
    "so it is natural to have a lot of interest in studying coupling in the dark sector components @xcite . also it is possible to have information about these components through gravitational interaction .",
    "further , recently , it has been shown that an appropriate choice of the interaction between de and dm can alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite . + for the unknown and mysterious nature of de , it it is possible to have some insight demands that de should be compatible with holographic principle which states that `` the number of relevant degrees of freedom of a system dominated by gravity must vary along with the area of the surface bounding the system '' @xcite . such a de model known as holographic de ( hde ) model .",
    "further the energy density of any given region should be bounded by that ascribed to a schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) that fills the same volume @xcite .",
    "if we denote the de density by @xmath2 , @xmath3- size of the region ( infrared cut off ) and @xmath4 the reduced planck mass , then mathematically @xmath5 . as a standard practice we write",
    "de density @xmath2 as @xmath6 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 takes care of the uncertainties of the theory and the factor of three has been introduced for mathematical convenience . in the present work we choose @xmath8 , the ricci s length and @xmath9 , the radius of the future event horizon as the ir - cut off in two different sections .",
    "+ the argument behind the choice of the ricci s length as @xciteas ir cut off is that it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbatio , leading to the formation of a black hole @xcite . on the other hand , radius of the future event horizon",
    "is commonly used as the ir cut off of hde models which gives the correct equation of state and the desired accelerating universe .",
    "however , recently it has been shown @xcite that future event horizon suffers from a severe circularity problem .",
    "+ for the interacting dm and de to resolve the coincidence problem ( as mentioned above ) , the interaction term is chosen in the present work as ( i ) a linear combination of the energy densities of the two matter components i.e. of the form @xmath10 , ( ii ) a natural and physically viable interaction term of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 a dimensionally @xmath13 constant .",
    "i both the choices the interaction term should be positive definite ( i.e. @xmath14)so that there is transfer of energy from de component to dm section .",
    "this choice is favorable to solve the coincidence problem .",
    "also validity of the second law of thermodynamics and @xmath15 principle @xcite demand positive interaction term .",
    "it should be noted that the second choice of interaction term gives the best fit to observations @xcitefor hde models .",
    "lastly , we have not included baryonic matter in the interaction due to the constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite . + in 2003",
    "sahni et al @xcite proposed state - finder parameters @xmath16 which are defined as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the scale factor for the frw model , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "in fact the parameter @xmath21 forms the next step in the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological parameters after @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "these dimensionless parameters characterize the properties of dark energy in a model - independent manner . according to sahni",
    "et al trajectories in the @xmath16 plane plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitative different behavior . according to them",
    ", the state finder diagnostic together with snap observations may discriminate between different de models .",
    "+ in the present work , we analyze interacting holographic dark energy model in terms of state - finder parameters and possible resolution of the coincidence problem has been presented graphically .",
    "finally , we have analyzed universal thermodynamics in terms of @xmath23parameters .",
    "the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics result in some summarize the whole work .",
    "in this section , we consider homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat frw model of the universe bounded by ricci s length @xmath24 .",
    "the einstein field equations are @xmath25 and @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the energy density of the dark energy in the form of dust while @xmath28 are the energy density and thermodynamic pressure of the dark energy in the form of a perfect fluid having equation of state @xmath29 . due to holographic nature of the de",
    ", the energy density @xmath2 has the expression    @xmath30    where ir cut off is chosen at the ricci s length . as a consequence ,",
    "the equation of state parameter becomes    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the density parameter for the hde .",
    "+ to determine the evolution equation for the density parameter we start with the energy conservation relations    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    first of all in absence of interaction ( i.e. @xmath35 ) @xmath36 evolves according to    @xmath37    using @xmath38 we have @xmath39 and the above equation becomes    @xmath40    which on integration gives @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the integration constant .",
    "now we shall introduce interaction in the following ways : + * case i : * @xmath43 using both the conservations , the evolution of @xmath36 is given by    @xmath44\\ ] ]    or equivalently ,    @xmath45\\ ] ] the solution gives    @xmath46\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the integration constant .",
    "+ * case ii : * @xmath48    this choice of the interaction term with the conservation equations results the evolution equation for @xmath36 as @xmath49\\ ] ]    the state finder parameter as introduced by ( [ intro1 ] ) can have the expressions for the present model as    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the total energy density . thus eliminating @xmath53 we have the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55    @xmath56    i.e. @xmath57=3s\\left(1-\\frac{2\\omega_d}{3c^2}\\right)\\ ] ]       so for fixed @xmath36 we have straight line relation between the two parameters @xmath58 i.e. we have a family of straight lines in the @xmath59plane with density parameter @xmath36 as the parameter .",
    "in fact trajectories in the @xmath59plane correspond to different cosmological models , for example the fixed point @xmath60 on the horizontal axis represents @xmath0 model .",
    "further as @xmath61 so from relation ( [ 15 ] ) the coincidence problem corresponds to the straight line path @xmath62 in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "the commonly used ir cut off for the holographic model is chosen as the radius of the future event horizon @xmath63 given by    @xmath64    normally , @xmath65 is chosen as ir cut off to have correct accelerating universe .",
    "+ accordingly , the energy density for the hde can be written as    @xmath66    for this choice of @xmath2 we shall now find the expressions for the equation of state parameter @xmath67 and the evolution of the density parameter @xmath36 . + for @xmath68 , we have    @xmath69    and    @xmath70\\ ] ]    so from ( [ 15 ] )    @xmath71\\ ] ]       so in this case the coincidence problem corresponds to the straight line @xmath72 in @xmath59plane .",
    "similarly , for @xmath73 we obtain    @xmath74    and @xmath75\\ ] ]    thus the @xmath59 relation has the form    @xmath76\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we study the thermodynamics of frw universe filled with interacting hde . the universe is assumed to be bounded by the horizon which we choose separately to be ( i ) apparent horizon or ( ii ) event horizon or ( iii ) ricci scale . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been shown that both the apparent and event horizon do not change significantly over one hubble time scale so it is reasonable to consider equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature and entropy on the horizon similar to black holes .",
    "if @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the entropy of the matter distribution inside the horizon and that of the horizon respectively , then the time variation of the total entropy is given by ( for details see ref @xcite ) @xmath79\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the radius of the horizon and @xmath81 is the temperature of the horizon as well as of the inside matter for equilibrium thermodynamics . to examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics we first study the evolution of the horizons .",
    "+ for frw model , the dynamical apparent horizon which is essentially the marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion , is defined as a sphere of radius @xmath82 such that @xmath83 which on simplification gives    @xmath84    the event horizon on the other hand is defined as davis ( 1998 ) and @xcite    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the usual conformal time defined as , @xmath87    with @xmath88 for existence of event horizon . also the horizon radius corresponding to ricci s length is given by    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "as at present we are in a accelerating phase of the universe as the event horizon exists and the horizons are related by the relations    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the hubble horizon .",
    "the time variation of the horizon radii are given by    @xmath93 \\\\\\\\ { \\dot{r}}_e = r_e\\left[\\frac{1}{r_a}-\\frac{1}{r_e}\\right]\\\\\\\\ { \\dot{r}}_l=\\frac{r_l^3h^3}2[(1+q)+(1-r ) ] \\end{array } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    usig the expressio for @xmath94 from ( [ 29 ] ) into ( [ 24 ] ) we obtain the standard result in the literature that generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) is valid both in quintessence and in phantom era for the universe bounded by the apparent horizon .",
    "+ for the event horizon , as @xmath95 particularly in quintessence era so that gslt is satisfied unconditionally .",
    "on the other hand , in phantom era we may have @xmath96 ( for details see ref @xcite , so the validity of gslt is not unconditional . in fact ,",
    "as long as @xmath97 and @xmath98 then gslt will be satisfied but for @xmath99 i.e. @xmath100 we must have contraction of the event horizon for the fulfillment of gslt .",
    "+ from eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) we see that at the ricci scale @xmath101 increases until @xmath102 and gslt will be satisfied provided @xmath103 . on the other hand , if the above inequality is reserved i.e. @xmath104 , though @xmath101 is negative and the expression within the curly bracket of eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) is negative but still gslt will be satisfied .",
    "further as the state finder parameter @xmath21 is always greater than unity and @xmath105 may have positive or negative values so the above inequalities are modified as @xmath106 for the validity of gslt .",
    "these results are presented compactly in table 1 and the figure ( iii ) shows the valid region in @xmath107-plane for the validity of gslt .",

    "the paper deals with interacting holographic dark energy model in the back ground of flat frw model of the universe . two types of interaction are chosen for investigation of which one is the standard choice of the linear combination of the densities of the two matter system . the other one which is physically reasonable and supported by observational evidences is in the product form of the energy densities .",
    "here dark matter is chosen in the form of dust while the hde is chosen in the form of perfect fluid with variable equation of state .",
