    "loading of ultra - cold atoms into an optical lattice allows to study an `` artificial solid '' that is undisturbed by any imperfections present in real materials @xcite .",
    "it also allows to investigate a regime of strong correlations , when the energy of interactions between particles overcomes their kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "for example , in the realm of condensed matter physics , they manifest , e.g. , in optical excitation spectra , which shows spectral weight transfers connecting different energy scales @xcite . in the discussion of photoemission on solids , and in particular on the correlated electron systems , the most powerful and commonly used approach is based on the greens  function formalism . in this context , the propagation of a single electron in a many - body system is described by the time - ordered one - electron green s propagator .",
    "a common approach in describing strong electron correlations is based on consideration of the hubbard model @xcite . in the context of bosonic systems ,",
    "these properties can be also studied in systems of ultra - cold gases in optical lattices via methods based on a response to scattering of photons : radio - frequency spectroscopy @xcite , raman spectroscopy @xcite and bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these experiments reveal the band structure of these systems , which can be used to compare the quantum gas phases with their condensed - matter counterparts .",
    "one key piece of evidence for the mott insulator phase transition is the loss of global phase coherence of the matter wave function .",
    "however , there are many possible sources of phase decoherence in these systems .",
    "substantial decoherence can be induced by quantum or thermal depletion of the condensate , so loss of coherence is not a proof that the system resides in the mott insulator ground state .",
    "although the initial system can be prepared at a relatively low temperature , the ensuing system after ramp - up of the lattice has a temperature which is usually higher due to adiabatic and other heating mechanisms .",
    "recent experiments have reported temperatures on the order of @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the hopping parameter , measures the kinetic energy of bosons @xcite . at such temperatures ,",
    "the effects of excited states become important , motivating investigations of the the _ finite _ temperature phase diagrams , showing the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations .    in the present paper",
    "we study combined effects of a confining lattice potential and finite temperature on the excitation spectra of the bose - hubbard model in two and three dimensions .",
    "the relevant part of the low - energy excited states involve one or two particles of the many - body ground - state and they are respectively connected to the momentum @xmath3 and energy @xmath4-dependent one - particle spectral function @xmath5 , which describes the probability of removing a particle from the system and creating an excitation .",
    "this is precisely the quantity , which we want to study in the present paper . to this end ,",
    "w perform calculations of the one - particle spectral function for the bose - hubbard model on the square and cubic lattice using a recently developed the quantum u(1 ) rotor approach @xcite .",
    "the collective variables for phase are isolated in the form of the space  time fluctuating phase field governed by the u(1 ) symmetry . as a result",
    "interacting particles appear as a composite objects consisting of bare bosons with attached u(1 ) gauge fields .",
    "this allows us to write the boson green s function in the space - time domain as the product of the u(1 ) phase propagator and the bare boson correlation function .",
    "the problem of calculating the spectral line shapes now becomes one of determining the convolution of phase and bare boson green s functions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : first , in section ii we introduce the microscopic bose - hubbard model that is an accepted description of strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice . furthermore , in sections iii and iv we briefly present the used method and arrive at the expressions for the one - particle spectral function .",
    "this allows us to present in section v the resulting excitation spectra of bosons in two- and three - dimensional optical lattice and discuss the influence of the temperature on the shape of spectral lines and the presence of superfluid phase .",

    "summation @xmath12 runs over nearest neighbors of a regular two- ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice . the on - site repulsion depending on the number of atoms occupying every lattice site",
    "is given by @xmath13 term .",
    "finally , the chemical potential @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) controls the total number of bosons introduced to the lattice ( with @xmath16 being the total number of lattice sites ) .",
    "the hamiltonian and its modifications have been widely studied within the recent years using both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite methods .",

    "@xcite ) combined with the bogoliubov method @xcite that has been recently proposed and successfully applied to systems of bosons in optical lattices .",
    "this scenario provides a picture of quasiparticles and energy excitations in the strong - interaction limit , where the transition between the superfluid and the mott state is driven by phase fluctuations .",
    "the essence of the approach is the separation of the original bose field into its amplitude and fluctuating phase that was absent in the original bogoliubov treatment . as a result ,",
    "one arrives at a formalism where the one - particle correlation functions are treated self - consistently and permit us to investigate a whole range of phenomena described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , the phase fluctuations are described within the quantum spherical model @xcite , which goes beyond the mean - field approximation , including both quantum and spatial correlations .",
    "the method is based on a local gauge transformation to the new bosonic variables : @xmath33 which allows extraction of the phase variable @xmath34 , whose ordering naturally describes the superfluidmott - insulator transition , and the amplitude @xmath35 , which is related to the superfluid density . as a result",
