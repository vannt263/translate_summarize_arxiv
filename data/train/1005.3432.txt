    "charged and neutral leptons should be regarded as the composite structures which made up of more fundamental constituents . the existence of such quark and leptons substructure should be regarded as the ground state of a rich spectrum of new particles with new quantum numbers . therefore , the discovery of excited quarks and leptons would be different signal for compositeness .",
    "all composite models have an underlying substructure which is characterized by a scale @xmath4 . for the precise measurement of electron and muon g-2 and theoretical calculations the @xmath5 @xmath6",

    "if the energy of the outgoing intact protons is measured by the vfd s , exclusive or photon - induced process provide an additional method to calculate the invariant mass of the central system .",
    "photon - induced reactions are electromagnetic in nature which is one of the advantages of the this type interactions .",
    "moreover , the lepton pair production by two photon fusion is currently being planned to be used as a luminosity monitor for the lhc @xcite .",
    "the main contamination to these clean environment comes from the proton dissociation in to the x , y system , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath16 are baryon excitations .",

    "@xcite the main possible contamination comes from the proton dissociation in to the @xmath47 , @xmath16 system such as @xmath78 where @xmath47 and @xmath16 baryon excitations ( e.g @xmath79 , @xmath80 isobars ) . to eliminate this background",

    "it turns out that excited leptons exchange is the dominant effect in high @xmath95 scattering . in this motivation in figure ( [ fig3]a ) , we plot cross section of @xmath0 with and without excited lepton exchange as a function of the minimum transverse momentum ( @xmath100 or @xmath95 cut ) of the final state leptons for @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 . obviously larger cross sections are obtained with similar curves when the @xmath101 values increase .",
    "for instance for @xmath102 @xmath99 and @xmath96 @xmath97 cross sections are ; @xmath103 @xmath104 for @xmath105 @xmath97 and @xmath106 @xmath104 for @xmath107 @xmath97 .",
    "we see from figure ( [ fig3]a ) that the deviations from the sm gets to be higher as the @xmath108 cut increases since sm contributions highly peaked in the forward and backward directions due to @xmath89 , @xmath109 poles as we observe from equations ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "therefore both angular distribution or the @xmath108 cut can be used to improve sensitivity bounds .",
    "hence , we impose different cuts on the transverse momentum of the final state leptons to decrease the sm events .",
    "we should note that poisson distribution is appropriate sensitivity analysis , since the number of sm events with this cuts is small enough . in this statical analysis ,",

    ", there is no need to impose high cuts on the transverse momentum of the final state leptons to suppress the sm events number . in this acceptance region ,",
    "invariant mass of the final leptons is greater than @xmath135 @xmath97 due to high lower bound of @xmath56 .",

    "figure ( [ fig2]b ) shows the @xmath108 distribution of the final state lepton at the corresponding forward detector acceptance for @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 .",

    "the cross section of @xmath0 is given in figure ( [ fig3]b ) as a function of the @xmath108 cut for same parameters in figure ( [ fig3]a ) .",

    "excited lepton contributions and the sm are well separated from each other for large values of the @xmath108 cut .",
