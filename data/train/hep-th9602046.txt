    "when @xmath137 the singularities lie on the imaginary axis and hence play no role ; however for @xmath138 the singular points are real and tend to 1 as @xmath139 at which point the original sum diverges .",
    "use of the poisson - summation formula implicitly assumes that @xmath134 is analytic so that its fourier integral decomposition exists and hence can not be used for @xmath140 .",
    "similarly , the approach above also implicitly assumes that the function is analytic along the real line in the evaluation of the bessel function integrals . in performing the analytic continuations",
    "one should be careful to ensure that the domain of convergence of the final result is the same as that of the original zeta function .",
    "returning now to the full result of equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) we can now proceed to write down the thermodynamic potentials . remembering that @xmath141 , and using the volume of @xmath1 , @xmath142 , we can immediately write down the pressure ( for @xmath143 ) @xmath144 . \\label{3.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first few terms in the pressure are essentially unobservable renormalisation constants ( since one can only really measure differences in pressure ) , and the last term is the term that one would predict from normal statistical mechanics . the bessel function term , however , is observable since it varies with volume",
    "; it is a contribution to the pressure due to the casimir effect .",
    "notice ( as one would expect ) that it is independent of both the temperature and chemical potential - its origin is in the vacuum , not the finite temperature and chemical potential effects .",
    "also , because of the asymptotic form of the bessel functions , this term tends towards zero as the volume ( and therefore @xmath60 ) tends to infinity ; it will not survive the infinite volume limit .    equation ( [ 3.10 ] ) on its own does not completely determine the pressure : @xmath0 is unknown . to rectify this , we must now consider the vacuum expectation value of the charge . above the critical temperature it is given by ( [ 2.13 ] ) @xmath145 the charge @xmath25",
    "is made up from two parts : one contribution from particles ( chemical potential @xmath0 ) , and a contribution from antiparticles ( chemical potential @xmath146 ) .",
    "its high temperature behaviour is examined in @xcite .",
    "the low temperature behaviour ( @xmath147 ) would be trivial to calculate , except that a priori one can not be sure that ( [ 3.11 ] ) still holds .    if one plots ( [ 3.11 ] ) as a function of @xmath0 one obtains a graph similar to fig .",
    "[ charge ] .the charge diverges whenever @xmath0 tends to one of the @xmath148 , and it is multivalued , being divided up into intervals by these values .",
    "now from ( [ 3.11 ] ) @xmath0 and its derivatives are well defined within each of these intervals ( since the sums are absolutely convergent ) hence @xmath0 is a continuous function of @xmath12 in these regions .",
    "furthermore , within each of these regions @xmath25 takes on all values ; hence after choosing one of these regions one can never evolve out of it by a change of @xmath25 or @xmath12 .",
    "since a change of @xmath149 ( i.e swapping particles with antiparticles ) must cause @xmath150 only the first region is physical .",
    "although we can not solve for @xmath0 analytically , in the case of the einstein universe we have done so numerically .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( which uses the charge density @xmath151 rather than @xmath25 . from the figure",
    ", one can see that in fact there is no critical temperature : @xmath0 tends towards its critical value , only reaching it at @xmath152 .",
    "this is most marked in the case @xmath153 .",
    "when the volume becomes large , the curve for @xmath0 starts to look more like the scenario given above and @xmath0 tends asymptotically to its critical value ( but it still does not reach it until @xmath154 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath121 $ ] term in @xmath155 is always zero : there is no symmetry breaking on the einstein universe and hence bec does not occur .",
    "in the previous section we examined numerically the einstein static universe and showed that the critical temperature is zero , in contrast to calculations based on high temperature expansions ( which implicitly assume that there is a non zero critical temperature ! ) .",
    "we now wish to consider the generic case of a compact spatial manifold .    usually in statistical mechanics , we are interested in the limit as both the volume and the number of particles tends to infinity .",
    "it is then meaningless to talk about @xmath25 , because if we imagine starting off at some low temperature with no anti - particles the charge will also become infinite .",
    "thus we now restrict our attention to @xmath151 . for a general finite volume space",
    ", this will be given by ( see appendix.[appendix1 ] or @xcite ) @xmath156 where the @xmath148 satisfy @xmath157   but are otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the form of @xmath158 vs @xmath0 must be similar to fig.1 : @xmath159 whenever @xmath160 and by similar arguments to those in section [ sec : one ] @xmath0 lies in the region @xmath161 ( the summand behaves like @xmath162 as @xmath148 becomes large - which we expect to happen as @xmath163 - therefore the sum is absolutely convergent ) .",
    "thus we separate off the ground state contribution from @xmath158 : @xmath164 and we consider the situation when @xmath0 is close to its critical value .",

    "[ 4.1 ] ) is to be considered as an equation in the unknown @xmath0 ; @xmath158 is a measurable quantity which here we consider as fixed .",
    "furthermore , all the equations which were used to derive ( [ 4.1 ] ) are well defined at every point except the critical value ( ie are well defined for all @xmath168 ) ; thus no matter how close to the critical point we are , we must always be able to solve for @xmath0 .",
    "but this is just the statement that the limit of the r.h.s of ( [ 4.1 ] ) exists as @xmath169 and is equal to @xmath158 .",
    "now @xmath170 tends to some limit , @xmath171 say , as @xmath169.(this must be true because the only divergent part is in the ground state ; the sum in @xmath172 is absolutely convergent and therefore must sum to some value at @xmath173 ) .",
    "let us call the ground state contribution in ( [ 4.1 ] ) @xmath174 and let us also define the constant @xmath175 .",
    "assume that we have a critical point , ie a point where @xmath176 as @xmath177 .",
    "thus we must have that @xmath178 but by expanding @xmath179 in terms of @xmath180 , it is easy to show that @xmath181 the only way that we can get a finite limit for @xmath158 as @xmath182 ( and @xmath177 ) is if @xmath183 as @xmath169 .    for a finite volume space",
    "we must have @xmath184 as  @xmath169 ; thus @xmath185 as @xmath176 and the critical temperature is zero . since for all finite @xmath186 , @xmath187 this also means that there can be no symmetry breaking in such spaces .",
    "however , as we saw in the einstein universe , if the volume is large we expect that @xmath0 can be quite close to its critical value for some finite temperature ; thus there will be a large number of particles in the ground state and the physics will look similar to the infinite volume physics . in this situation",
    "the temperature at which we expect some degree of condensation is at a critical temperature obtained by taking the infinite volume limit .",
    "alternatively one can try to define the onset of condensation by looking for the maximum of the specific heat since this is the property which is usually searched for experimentally .",
    "we examined the einstein static universe numerically , and showed that the critical temperature defined by @xmath176 is zero in contrary to previous calculations .",
    "these gave the wrong result because they were based on high temperature expansions .",

    "use of this expansion in ( [ a4 ] ) together with expanding the @xmath218 allows one to find @xmath219 thus the residue of @xmath220 exists and can be written down in general . as claimed earlier , one can see that it depends only on the geometry of the space .",
    "unfortunately the authors are aware of no similar method for calculating @xmath221 in general , and one is reduced to working out the analytic continuation of @xmath222 case by case . however , since the statistical mechanical contribution can be written down explicitly , one only needs to focus on the zero temperature zeta functions .",
    "a simple modification of the einstein static universe is to identify antipodal points on @xmath1 .",
    "two cases are possible : periodic identification and antiperiodic identification of the fields . in the case of periodic identification",

    "the factor of four in @xmath2 appears simply because the space has half the volume that it had originally .as the volume becomes large we expect the log term in @xmath155 to also be directly proportional to the volume , which explains the four here ( as the sum tends to an integral , the measure will give a term proportional to @xmath234 .",

    "the spacetime gives us an effective thermodynamic mass , @xmath233 , identical to the value on @xmath1 , however the detailed dependence of the sums at small volume is now radically different .      previously , it has been remarked that there would be many interesting properties of this space associated with the possibility of have a @xmath237 dependent charge density .",
