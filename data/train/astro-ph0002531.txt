    "giant molecular cloud complexes ( gmcs ) , the birth places of stars , are typically many tens of parsecs in linear extent and have masses from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and temperatures of 1030 k ( see @xcite for a recent review )",
    ". observations of co emission from gmcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) show them to be composed of many smaller clumps that are a few parsecs in extent and contain @xmath2 .",
    "the widths of co emission lines originating in individual clumps are supersonic and have been attributed to the presence of alfvn waves having subalfvnic velocity amplitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the alfvn waves contribute to the support of a clump along the direction of the large - scale magnetic field ; the damping of the waves affects the degree of support that they provide .",
    "an important and well understood mechanism for the damping of linear alfvn waves in a partially ionized medium is that due to ion - neutral friction which depends on the ionization structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "ruffle et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter r98 ) and hartquist et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have emphasised that the dependence of the ionization structure on total visual extinction , @xmath3 , should greatly influence the density profiles of clumps if alfvn waves contribute to their support . to quantify the assertion of hartquist et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and r98 , we present in this paper models of plane - parallel , wave - supported gmc clumps like those identified in the work of williams et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who made a detailed analysis of the co maps of the rosette molecular cloud ( rmc ) , identifying more than 70 clumps .",
    "the models that we have constructed are for rmc - type clumps in equilibrium , a restriction justified by the fact that clear spectral signatures of collapse have been found only when much smaller scale features have been resolved ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have adopted a wkb description of the wave propagation as did martin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in their work on wave - supported clumps .",
    "their work differs substantially from ours in that they used an ionization structure appropriate for dark regions .",
    "also , we have considered inwardly rather than outwardly propagating waves , as many of the clumps mapped by williams et al .",
    "( 1995 ) do not contain detected stars and may have no internal means of generating waves .",
    "indeed , the waves may be produced at the surface of a clump by its interaction with an interclump medium .",
    "other authors have addressed the importance of photoabsorption for the effects that the ionization structure will have upon a clump s dynamics .",
    "these authors have been concerned primarily with dense cores and/or envelopes around them ; cores are much smaller - scale objects than the clumps identified in williams et al .",
    "mckee ( 1989 ) addressed the possibility that collapse in a system of dense cores is a self - regulating process due to the ionization of metals such as magnesium and sodium by photons emitted by stars formed in the collapse ; he was concerned with infall due to ambipolar diffusion of a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "ciolek & mouschovias ( 1995 ) have shown that the large - scale magnetic field can support a photoionized envelope around a dense core for a time that is very long compared to the ambipolar diffusion timescale in the center of the dense core . in contrast to mckee ( 1989 ) and ciolek & mouschovias ( 1995 ) , myers & lazarian ( 1998 ) addressed the effect of photoabsorption on support by waves rather than by the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "they stressed that observed infall of dense core envelopes is slower than that expected due to gravitational free - fall and more rapid than collapse due to the reduction by ambipolar diffusion of support by an ordered large - scale magnetic field .",
    "they considered collapse of material supported primarily by waves and subjected to an external radiation field .",
    "while they made clear comments about the importance of the @xmath3 dependence of the ionization structure for their model , they did not perform any detailed calculations in which a realistic dependence of the ionization fraction on @xmath3 was used .",
    "several sets of authors have considered nonlinear effects in the dissipation of waves supporting a clump .",
    "gammie & ostriker ( 1996 ) investigated models of plane - parallel clumps and from their `` 1 2/3-dimensional '' models found dissipation times due to nonlinear effects to be longer than the alfvn crossing times for a fairly large range of parameters .",
    "the three dimensional investigations of mac low et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest the more restrictive condition that the angular frequency of the longest waves be no more than a few times @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the alfvn crossing time ) in order for the dissipation timescale due to nonlinear damping to be roughly the alfvn crossing time or more . in most cases addressed in this paper",
    "we have restricted our attention to such angular frequencies so that we are justified to lowest order in focusing on only the damping due to ion - neutral friction .",
    "it should be noted that the above three dimensional studies of nonlinear effects concerned homogeneous turbulence and did not include ion - neutral damping for a realistic ionization structure . if we are correct in supposing that the waves in clumps are driven externally , then the turbulence is not homogeneous and its nature depends on both the viscous scale set by ion - neutral damping and the exact boundary conditions .",
    "the effects of nonlinear damping and multiple dimensions will be considered in subsequent work .    in sect .",
    "2 we present the equations for the wave energy , the static equilibrium clump structure , and the gravitational field . in sect .",
    "3 we give a description of the calculations of the ionization structure for various values of the clump density and @xmath3 while sect .",
    "4 contains details of the models considered here . finally , in sect .",
    "5 , we present conclusions .",
    "we consider plane - parallel clumps with @xmath6 corresponding to the clump midplane and @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 defined as positive ) corresponding to boundary between the clump and the interclump medium .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is taken to be @xmath9 with @xmath10 normal to the surface of a plane - parallel clump .",
    "we study waves of angular frequency @xmath11 propagating from @xmath12 in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the ion velocity can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is defined below and @xmath16 is the real component of the complex wave vector .",
    "hartquist & morfill ( 1984 ) used a two - fluid treatment to examine a related problem and showed that for an inwardly propagating linear alfvn wave @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the complex conjugate of the ion velocity perturbation and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is ion mass density and @xmath21 is the neutral mass density .",
    "the ion alfvn velocity is given by @xmath22 the ion - neutral coupling frequency , @xmath23 , is such that the momentum transfer per unit volume per unit time from ions to neutrals is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the velocity of the neutrals . to a reasonably good approximation , c@xmath26 is the dominant ion and we may take @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ion number density ( @xcite ) . if the dominant ion species are very massive , as occurs at large @xmath3 and densities , the constant would approach @xmath29s@xmath30 . however , in this work we ignore this dependence and use @xmath31 as the mass per ion .    if @xmath15 in eq .",

    ", we assume an @xmath3-dependent dissociation rate that results in a co abundance relative to @xmath54 , x(co ) , that is in harmony with the measurements shown in fig . 6 of van dishoeck ( 1998 ) . for the @xmath55@xmath53 model ,",
    "table  [ tab : rates ] gives x(co ) and the photodissociation rate as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "note that the total abundance of carbon nuclei relative to @xmath54 is fixed at @xmath56 . in the work reported here , we used an ionization fraction that depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath54 . using the @xmath3-dependent co photodissociation rate from table  [ tab : rates ] , we calculated the fractional ionization as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath57  and  @xmath58@xmath53 at various @xmath3 values .",
    "a bilinear interpolation in @xmath3 and @xmath54 is used to find the actual ionization fraction used for a given point in the clump . for densities above @xmath59@xmath53",
    "we assume that the total ionization fraction , @xmath60 , goes as @xmath61 , as expected in a dark region .",
    "note that in all models , @xmath3 is always greater than 4 whenever @xmath62@xmath53 .",
    "since the depletions in rmc - type clumps are very uncertain , we present results for both depletion cases given in r98 . as discussed therein",
    "( also see shalabiea & greenberg 1995 ) , case a abundances resemble those seen in dark cores with @xmath63 while case b , with higher fractional abundances of lower ionization potential elements , is more appropriate for more diffuse clouds .",

    "[ fig : rho ] we present density as a function of visual extinction for each of the 5 models .",
    "it is clear that the newer ionization profiles used in models 13 result in less condensed , more extended clumps than the profile used in model 4 .",
    "in fact , @xmath54 is roughly proportional to @xmath65 in models 13 while @xmath54 goes roughly as @xmath66 in model 4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltab ] we show plots of @xmath67 versus @xmath3 for models 14 . except for model 4 , which has @xmath68 approaching @xmath69 at the clump boundary so that eq .",
    "[ eq : test ] is not satisfactorily satisfied , the perturbing field obeys flux conservation near the surface of the clump . in model 1 , in the central region of the clump dissipation is rapid enough that @xmath67 begins to decrease . in order to compensate for the loss of support",
    ", the equilibrium solution requires a complementary increase in the density , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] . on the other hand , in model 4",
    ", the turbulence is dissipated much nearer to the cloud boundary , thus requiring a steeper overall density profile .",
    "the higher ionization fractions of the case b depletions result in very little dissipation even in the center of the clump for model 2 . note that even though observations ( @xcite ) suggest that the temperature of rmc - type clumps is closer to 10 k rather than the 20 k used here , thermal support is insignificant except in the centre of model 1 , so the effect of a lower temperature on the models would be merely to enhance slightly any central condensations .",
    "the ionization profiles used in the models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] . the ionization profiles described in sec .",
    "3 result in @xmath70 for models 13 being more than 50 times greater near the surface of the clump than in model 4",
    ". however , in the center of the clump the ionization fraction drops , resulting in more dissipation .",
    "again , this leads to clumps that are overall more diffuse but with small condensed cores .",
    "clearly , clumps with @xmath71 will have distinct central condensations with @xmath72 and central fractional ionizations of @xmath73 . though dense cores may be formed during the fairly rapid collapse (",
    "as envisaged by fielder & mouschovias 1993 ) of more extended objects ( i.e. rmc - like clumps ) that become unstable , even in our equilibrium models we find central cores having densities and fractional ionizations similar to those measured for dense cores and their envelopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : flux ] shows the flux of magnetic energy through the clumps for models 14 . near the clump center ,",
    "model 1 is nearly thermally supported due to the dissipation of the turbulence .",
    "the higher ionization fraction for the case b depletions used in model 2 results in less dissipation and thus more turbulent support for the clump .",
    "consequently , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] , model 2 has no central condensation and is more extended .",
    "unfortunately , we can only speculate about how the depletions of sulphur , metals , and some other species behave in rmc - like clumps ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , cases a and b are merely representative ; as can be clearly seen in the figures , the clump profiles are very sensitive to the choice of abundances and the subsequent fractional ionizations . in addition , compared to model 1 , the stronger ion - neutral coupling in model 3 results in less dissipation and subsequently the clump has little central condensation , as expected .",
    "note however that for model 3 the lower limit in eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] is not adequately satisfied .",
    "[ fig : flux ] also shows the effect of external wave generation .",
    "if the fractional ionization is too low , as in model 4 , dissipation occurs close to the surface of the clump .",
    "conversely , if the fractional ionization is too large , as in model 2 , significant dissipation occurs only at the clump s very centre .",
    "both extremes produce density profiles which lack a central condensation .",
    "note that if our externally generated wave model is correct , one should not see turbulence within a condensed core if there is no turbulence in its surrounding envelope .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] we present curves which map the visual extinction to the spatial extent of the clumps .",
    "clouds with larger extents which match the observed 23 pc size of rmc - type clumps ( @xcite ) can not be reproduced within the constraints given in sect .",
    "however , observations generally measure the largest linear extent of a clump .",
    "thus , since the waves only support the model clumps parallel to the large - scale field , it is not surprising that the model sizes given here are less than the observed sizes .",
    "similarly , the models require high boundary densities and magnetic field strengths in order for the alfvn speed and wave velocity amplitude at visual extinctions where co is abundant to be large enough to be compatible with observed linewidths . for model 1 , @xmath74 @xmath53 .",
    "this is rather higher than the typical value of @xmath75 @xmath53 given by williams et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for rmc - type clumps but , given the uncertainties , it is within a reasonable range of the williams et al .",
    "( 1995 ) value . for model 1 , @xmath76 g ,",
    "significantly higher than the value of @xmath77 g suggested by observations ( @xcite ) and expected from robust theoretical arguments ( @xcite ) . in order to determine whether the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 could be lower and",
    "still allow model properties to be consistent with observed linewidths , we constructed models for clumps with total edge - to - center extinctions of 3 magnitudes .",
    "the model giving @xmath80 km sec@xmath30 and @xmath81 km sec@xmath30 at @xmath82 had @xmath83 @xmath53 , @xmath84 g , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 pc ; although @xmath78 and @xmath79 were smaller and @xmath87 larger , the agreement with observations is nonetheless poor .",
    "thus , the next step in the modelling of clumps in which wave support is important is the inclusion of wave support in models analogous to the axisymmetric models of magnetically and thermally suported clumps described in classic papers by mouschovias ( 1976a,1976b ) .",
    "it is possible that the inclusion of magnetic tension , as well as pressure , will allow the reduction of @xmath79 to a value more like that expected and the construction of models of clumps having larger linear extents .",
