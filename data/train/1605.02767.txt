    "however , for larger systems ( @xmath115 ) the exponential decay @xmath172 will eliminate the possibility of negative energy fluctuations . also , notice that for the situation where the temperatures of both reservoirs are equal @xmath173 , the expression above vanishes since @xmath174 , so negative and positive fluctuations are equally likely to happen in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in the heating protocol @xmath175 , as reverse heat exchange becomes less likely , notice that @xmath176 immediately implies @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , in the heating protocol , a negative energy fluctuation is extremely rare in the thermodynamic limit , driven by the exponential penalty @xmath172 with @xmath177 , reproducing a physical outcome for the arrow of time in large systems .",
    "we have obtained an exact analytic solution to the langevin energy dynamics associated to a nanoparticle in a low friction thermal bath and trapped by a harmonic potential , within an energetic stochastic scope .",

    "@xcite with the laser protocol we proposed inspired by ref .",
    "we stress that , usually in this class of problems , the time - dependent probability distributions for stochastic trajectories are only assessed via experimental or numerical estimations , as in refs .",
    "actually , these previous works were able to display analytical results only for asymptotic probability distribution functions which characterize steady or equilibrium states .",
    "in contrary to this fact , we were able to attain the nonequilibrium time - dependent probability distribution function @xmath42 to our sde by importing the general solution from refs .",
    "@xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time this sde solution has been successfully applied to describe a physical system in a nonequilibrium thermodynamics context , and this feature of our analytical analysis sheds a new light at the general discussion on brownian motion problems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the general solution of the energetic stochastic dynamics was utilized for describing a nonequilibrium dynamic relaxation protocol : by abruptly switching the trap stiffness of our setup at @xmath40 , our langevin nanoparticle behaves as if it had an effective temperature @xmath113 which differs from the thermal bath @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", we were able to analyze the relaxation process of the nanoparticle towards equilibrium for a nonequilibrium cooling or heating process .",
    "we have also explicitly verified that the heat exchange fluctuation theorem ( xft )  @xcite is indeed satisfied for our protocol , which makes our system a good textbook example of a ft application .",
    "furthermore , we show our analytical results are consistent with the limits of large @xmath6 , which is represented by the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann distribution , and of a large number @xmath0 of independent particles , which correspond to the clt predictions .",
    "then , direct numerical monte carlo simulations were performed in order to confirm the validation of our time - dependent exact solutions , and an excellent agreement between them was observed .",
    "finally , we have computed the probability of reverse heat flow of our stochastic trajectories , which would be analogous to the violation of the second law of thermodynamics at the macroscopic regime .",
    "this violation probability becomes relevant for small systems and short time scales , as it was experimentally verified in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "in this section , the sde for the energy ( [ langevinfore ] ) is deduced .",
    "the connection between the sde and the underlying fokker - planck equation is also discussed .",

    "the energy of the system is defined as @xmath180 because both position and momentum are stochastic quantities , the energy defined above is also stochastic .",
    "its random value depends on the particle s random position and momentum simultaneously .",
    "however , one may use the equation of motion ( [ langevin ] ) to derive a equation for the energy evolution in time . in a deterministic hamiltonian system ,",
    "the energy evolution is straightforward , @xmath181 .",
    "but the dissipation and the random nature of the langevin problem will allow the energy to fluctuate in time . in order to deal with differentials of stochastic quantities",
    ", one should use a framework of stochastic calculus . in this case , the tool to be used is the ito s lemma @xcite for the energy @xmath182 : @xmath183 notice that the equation above resembles a taylor s expansion of the differential @xmath32 in second order of @xmath184 and @xmath185 . as both @xmath178 and @xmath186 are stochastic variables , they are not differentiable in time",
    ". therefore , the terms in @xmath187 and @xmath188 may contain relevant information .",
    "following the steps of @xcite , replacing ( [ apeq01 ] ) in ( [ apeq02 ] ) leads to    @xmath189    now we need to use the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , together with @xmath190 , to find a equation for to find an equation for @xmath185 . in this case",

    "however , one may explore the highly underdamped limit @xmath196 to approximate the sde for the energy , as presentented in @xcite with the mathematical details .",
    "physically speaking , this limit considers the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , or its equivalent ( [ apeq04 ] ) , with very small dissipation and fluctuation terms when compared to the potential energy determined by the laser frequency . in this case",
    ", the particle behaves locally in time as a harmonic oscillator with energy @xmath56 over the small time interval of a laser oscillation , @xmath197 .",
    "thus it makes the virial theorem useful , @xmath198 , where the @xmath199 symbol is understood as the average over a time small time interval . replacing the virial theorem approximation in ( [ apeq06 ] )",
    "leads to the final form of the sde for the energy of a single particle in one dimension : @xmath200 which can be understood as the general sde for the energy in the case @xmath128 and @xmath28 .",
    "the introduction of a system of @xmath0 independent particles in @xmath27 dimensions is straightforward .",

    "it is easy to see that the noise term above is a sum of gaussian random variables with zero mean .",
    "the sum is equivalent to a single gaussian increment with variance given by @xmath206 where the uncorrelated noise , @xmath207 , and the definition ( [ apeq08 ] ) were used in the last passage .",
    "actually , one might replace the sum of uncorrelated gaussian noises by a single gaussian noise with same mean and variance .",
    "it simplifies ( [ apeq09 ] ) to the final form of the sde of the energy of a system of independent particles : @xmath208 with @xmath209 , for simplicity .",
    "equation above is the equation ( [ langevinfore ] ) used in the present article , with @xmath128 . as mentioned in the introduction , this sde has a linear drift with a noise proportional to @xmath210 .",
    "the time dependent pdf for this equation is the solution to the following fokker - planck equation :    @xmath211    with @xmath212 .",
    "fortunately , the mathematical details leading to the solution of this pde from its laplace transform were derived by feller , as it is shown in eq .",
    "( @xmath213 ) of ref",

    "the author is aware that the pde equivalent to ( [ apeq11 ] ) could be interpreted as the fokker - planck equation of a diffusion problem with a linear diffusion coefficient , @xmath214 .",
    "moreover , the physically sound solution to our problem , which corresponds to the case @xmath215 , has been utilized by the cir model in quantitative finance , as it can be seen in eq .",
    "( @xmath216 ) of ref .",
    "finally , as it is discussed in this present article , the same solution can be applied to the energy of a langevin nanosystem .",
    "initially , the nanoparticle is optically trapped by a laser with frequency @xmath17 at room temperature @xmath64 , which leads to an equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution with @xmath26 degrees of freedom , where @xmath27 is the number of spatial dimensions . at @xmath38 , the laser frequency",
    "is changed linearly as @xmath217 over a small time interval @xmath218 , and kept constant ( @xmath219 ) for @xmath41 .",

    "notice that @xmath241 ( @xmath242 ) for @xmath243 ( @xmath244 ) corresponds to an adiabatic heating ( cooling ) process during the time interval @xmath218 .",

    "the scale transformation preserves the mb distribution of the energy random variable , leading to an effective temperature @xmath245 .",
    "as the distribution is not in equilibrium with the room temperature @xmath64 , it is expected a relaxation towards equilibrium for @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , we may readily identify that @xmath246 . also notice that ( [ ap2eq04 ] ) implies @xmath247 is a constant during the protocol . by averaging the energy and using the usual definition of volume @xmath248 @xcite , one obtains @xmath249 , which is similar to the polytropic process equation of a thermodynamical adiabatic process .",
