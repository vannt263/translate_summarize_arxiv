    "there has been intense recent interest in understanding the coarsening dynamics of phase - separating mixtures @xcite . for fluid systems",
    ", attention has focused on single - time quantities , e.g. , the correlation function and structure factor , or the growth law of the domain scale @xmath0 @xcite . an equally important and deeply related aspect of coarsening systems is the nature of the aging properties @xcite which are encoded in two - time quantities .",
    "this issue has been intensively studied in the context of disordered systems and structural glasses , in phase - separating systems without hydrodynamic modes , such as solid mixtures , but not in segregating fluids . in part , this is due to the scarcity of reliable numerical results for these systems . in this letter , we present the first molecular dynamics ( md ) results for aging in coarsening binary fluid . before discussing our model and results ,",
    "it is useful to give a brief overview of the main concepts .    following a quench inside the miscibility gap , a homogeneous binary mixture ( a+b ) separates into a - rich and b - rich phases .",
    "the evolution of the system from the randomly - mixed phase to the segregated state is a complex process .",
    "domains rich in a- and b - particles form and grow nonlinearly with time @xcite .",
    "this coarsening is a self - similar process which is reflected in the scaling behavior of various physical quantities , as the two - point equal - time correlation function @xmath1 ( where the order parameter @xmath2 is the difference between the a and b concentrations and @xmath3 ) .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in the scaling form @xmath4 , @xmath5 being a time - independent master function .",
    "typically , @xmath0 grows in a power - law manner as @xmath6 , where the growth exponent @xmath7 depends upon the transport mechanism . for diffusive domain growth @xcite @xmath8 , which is referred to as the lifshitz - slyozov law .",
    "this behavior characterizes segregating solid mixtures .",
    "however in fluids , hydrodynamic transport mechanisms , important at large length scales , lead to much faster growth . in spatial dimension",

    "specifically , we find the two parameter scaling form @xmath27 where @xmath24 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 obeys the limiting behaviors : @xmath30 thus , in the diffusive regime ( @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) , we obtain a power - law decay of the scaling function as for spin systems . to the best of our knowledge , this has not been observed in previous studies of fluid phase separation .",
    "furthermore , and more importantly , in the hydrodynamic regime ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) , we find a crossover to a novel exponential .",
    "the latter finding is the central result of this letter . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 should be read as nearly pure diffusive and pure hydrodynamic regimes , respectively .",

    ", we have an ising - like fully symmetric model .",
    "the phase behavior and equilibrium properties of this system , that exhibits a liquid - liquid phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath52 , are well studied @xcite . for convenience , we set @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 to unity below .",
    "our choice of a high density ensures that the gas - liquid transition is well separated from the liquid - liquid one .",
    "we employ this model to study the kinetics of phase separation via md simulations @xcite by quenching homogeneous critical ( 50% a and 50% b particles ) configurations , prepared at a very high temperature @xmath55 , to temperatures below @xmath56 .",
    "we have used the verlet velocity algorithm with integration time step @xmath57 , where the time unit @xmath58 .",
    "the temperature was controlled via application of a nos - hoover thermostat @xcite , that is well - known to preserve hydrodynamics .    while unambiguous confirmation of expected hydrodynamic effects , via md simulation , in binary fluid phase separation was done only recently , by using this model @xcite , signature of such fast hydrodynamic mechanism",
    "was observed in a number of earlier md simulations @xcite .    for analysis of our results , we mapped the continuum fluid configurations onto a simple cubic lattice of size @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "there each site @xmath39 is occupied by a particle and we assign a spin value @xmath60 if it is an a - particle and @xmath61 elsewhere .",

    "as discussed in  @xcite , the second regime is consistent with linear hydrodynamic growth at later times . indeed",
    "the slightly off - parallel nature ( on a log - log plot ) of the late - time data from the linear behavior is due to non - zero off - sets at the crossovers that can be conveniently subtracted off to obtain a genuine linear behavior @xcite .",

    "( b ) as in ( a ) but at @xmath73.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=37.5% ]    as stated earlier , our primary objective is to study aging phenomena , essentially the behavior of @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot @xmath78 as a function of @xmath85 for different @xmath80 .",
    "it is observed that , for the smaller values of @xmath80 , presented in the inset , there is a reasonable collapse of data , not perfect though , and the master - curve obeys the form @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "this is the expected behavior for phase - separation in the diffusive stage .",
    "we must add here the reason for the imperfect collapse of data which will also explain the logic behind the choice of a narrow range of @xmath80 to demonstrate this power - law scaling behavior .",
    "the height at the beginning of the power - law regime changes with @xmath80 , the increase of which takes the domain order - parameter closer to the equilibrium value .",
    "further , with the increase of @xmath80 , faster decay due to hydrodynamics ( see below ) shows up earlier in @xmath88 . due to this latter fact the data sets as a whole",
    "give the impression of an exponent steeper than the expected value .",
    "however , from the results for @xmath89 in the main frame , consistencey with the fh exponent should be appreciated .    on the other hand , for larger values of @xmath80 ,",
    "e.g. @xmath90 in the main frame , a crossover from the fh behavior is observed , where , in the post crossover regime the decay of @xmath78 is much faster than a power law . in order to check for a possible exponential decay at large @xmath80 ,",
    "a semi - log plot is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . in this figure , the values of @xmath80 were judicially chosen such that for time beyond this , diffusive mechanism is practically negligible compared to the influence of hydrodynamics .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath80 in this figure , viz .",
    ", @xmath91 , was chosen being motivated by a finite - size scaling study @xcite that showed a pure viscous hydrodynamic behavior for time beyond this . interestingly , in this post - crossover regime a scaling form is recovered , as proven by the excellent data collapse .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the scaling function @xmath92 is very nicely consistent with an exponential decay . a similar behavior , with scaling and exponential decay of @xmath92",
    "is also observed for @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) , showing that the whole pattern is rather general . here",
    "we note that the rate of decay , defined by @xmath93 , in this hydrodynamic regime should depend upon the interfacial tension and the advection field ( influenced by transport properties like shear viscosity ) .",
    "this will be justified towards the end of this paper . as is clear from parts ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig4 ] , this decay rate is a temperature dependent quantity .",
    "the deviation from a linear look , observed for @xmath71 at very large values of @xmath88 , occur in a range of time where finite - size effects have been observed @xcite .",
    "indeed , as it can be recognized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for such times the size of domains is comparable to the system size , the liquid is close to equilibrium and thus the configurations change very slowly .",
    "for this reason , we are unable to access the _ inertial hydrodynamic _ regime [ @xmath94 in eq .  ( [ gl ] ) ] which would require significantly larger system sizes and is beyond our present computational resources .",
    "we attribute this exponential decay of the autocorrelation function to a fast advective field in the hydrodynamic regime which is explained below . the continuum dynamical equation [ cahn - hilliard ] , used to study kinetics of diffusive phase separation in binary alloys ,",
    "can be modified to @xcite @xmath95 to investigate hydrodynamic effects in fluid phase separation . here",
    "@xmath96 is the time and space dependent velocity field that also has dependence upon shear viscosity as well as other transport properties and @xmath97 is the chemical potential . in the regime where hydrodynamics is the dominant mechanism , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ explain1 ] ) ( that takes care of diffusion ) can be neglected to write @xmath98 assuming @xmath99 to be a constant and representing @xmath2 in the @xmath100-space , one obtains the solution @xmath101 hence for the @xmath100-space autocorrelation @xmath102 [ @xmath103 , one has @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the equal - time structure factor for time @xmath80 .",
    "the autocorrelation function then is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the ( real space ) correlation function at time @xmath80 .",
    "recalling the scaling property @xmath108 , one arrives at @xmath109 for small values of @xmath88 , porod s law @xcite states that @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a constant .",
    "this is consistent with an exponential decay for small @xmath88 .",
    "the question then is what happens for large values of @xmath88 . here",
    "note that an analytical form of @xmath112 , for conserved order - parameter dynamics , still remains a challenging task .",
    "however , our analysis of the numerical data [ see the inset of fig.[fig2 ] ] is suggestive of an exponential decay of the two - point equal time correlation function for large enough values of @xmath88 .",
    "we have undertaken the first study of aging dynamics during phase separation in a binary lennard - jones fluid .",
    "the average domain size grows in a power - law fashion , with an exponent @xmath74 ( diffusive ) at early times and @xmath75 ( viscous hydrodynamic ) at later times .",
    "this crossover has a remarkable consequence for the scaling form of the autocorrelation function @xmath78 . in the diffusive regime",
    ", @xmath78 shows a power - law decay with the fisher - huse exponent .",
    "however , in the hydrodynamic regime , we observe an exponential decay .",
    "this is due to the fact that advective hydrodynamic flows wash out the memory very rapidly by displacing the domains .",
    "we believe that the results presented here will arise fresh experimental and theoretical interest in this problem .",
