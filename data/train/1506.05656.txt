    "the reionization of helium ( he@xmath7 he@xmath2 ) requires highly energetic photons with energies above at least @xmath0  ev , and is therefore accompanied by a significant increase in the thermal energy of the igm @xcite .",

    "understanding the evolution of helium reionization is therefore important to understand the evolution of the igm as well as the formation of galaxies within the igm .",
    "+ observations from galaxy surveys and cmb signals suggest that most of the matter content of the universe is non - baryonic in nature .",

    "many particle physics models suggest that the dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with typical masses of @xmath9 gev which may annihilate into photons , electrons or positrons and neutrinos .",
    "we assume here an approximately equal distribution among the potential annihilation products , as expected from generic dark matter models .",
    "we however note that an annihilation signal would not be visible if the annihilation products consist of neutrinos only . as a result",

    "the dark matter candidates which are massive and have a negligible free - streaming length compared to the first protogalaxies are considered to be cold while the warm dark matter particles ( wdm ) are comparably less massive and their free - streaming length is comparable to the size of protogalaxies .",
    "wdm is a possible alternative to cdm since it can explain the presence of cuspy halos in our universe @xcite .",
    "light neutralinos of some susy models can be cdm candidates , while sterile neutrinos @xcite , majorons @xcite and light dark matter particles ( ldm ) @xcite are proposed to be among the candidates for wdm . while wdm can explain cuspy halos in our universe , it is ruled out by recent cmb observations and other data sets @xcite .",
    "we refer in particular to recent reviews @xcite for the different dark matter models .",
    "+ if dark matter consists of self - annihilating particles , one may expect to observe potential annihilation signals in regions where the dark matter density is particularly high , as in the center of our own galaxy .",

    "other observations suggest an excess of gev photons @xcite , microwave photons @xcite and positrons @xcite in the galactic center .",
    "an interpretation in terms of self - annihilating dark matter is favored by the approximately isotropic emission of such particles and the absence of correlations with the galactic disk .",
    "+ apart from the search for dark matter signals in our galactic center , models for their impact on various cosmological and astrophysical processes have been suggested in the literature .",
    "both particle physics and cosmological data provide bounds on their annihilation cross section @xcite and potential signatures in the recombination spectrum have been explored by chluba ( 2009 ) .",
    "the annihilation of dark matter particles leads to the production of energy , part of which is injected into the igm , where it can affect the ionization and thermal history of the universe .",
    "in general the ionization of hydrogen and helium occurs through similar processes , and can therefore be described with a similar framework ( _ e.g._@xcite ) . since dark matter particles are massive , their annihilation produces photons which have very high energies and typically provide minor contributions to the ionization of hydrogen and helium , unless extreme scenarios are considered @xcite . on the other hand more energetic photons",
    "are required to ionize he@xmath3 to he@xmath2 and such photons are still rare among the first sources of light .",
    "hence the contribution from the self - annihilation of dark matter is potentially more relevant in this case and will be explored in greater detail in this paper .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows . in  [ 1 ] we outline the different sources which affect the he@xmath2 fraction . in subsection  [ 2 ] , we explain the ionization equation , and in subsection  [ 3 ] , we describe the contribution of quasars to the formation of he@xmath2 . in  [ 4 ] we discuss the effects of dark matter annhilation assuming a uniform dark matter density , while in  [ 5 ] we take into account the clumped dark matter density taking into account different halo profiles . in sections  [ 6 ] , we describe our main results , and discuss our conclusions in  [ 7 ] .",

    "singly ionized helium with a ionization threshold of @xmath14  ev is produced along with the ionization of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath15  ev ) , which is generally considered to occur as a result of photoionization due to radiative feedback from the first stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "he@xmath3 has a similar recombination rate as h@xmath3 , while the recombination rate is enhanced for he@xmath2 by a factor of @xmath16 . in studies of helium reionization ,",
    "it is thus typically assumed that the single - ionization of helium is more or less co - eval with hydrogen reionization , while the ionization of he@xmath2 occurs at a later stage .",

    "iii stars , the number of ionizing photons at @xmath0  ev is suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath18 compared to the peak of the emission . however , observational studies suggest that reionization is predominantly driven by low - luminosity galaxies at high redshift @xcite , implying a more conventional stellar population . as a result ,",
    "the expected drop in the number of he@xmath3-ionizing photons is even more significant , requiring the emission in quasars or potentially due to the self - annihilation of dark matter .    in the following subsections , we outline the framework to describe how helium is doubly - ionized from its singly ionized state due to photons produced in quasars or as a result of dark matter annihilation .",
    "as shown in our calculation below , the formation of he@xmath2 occurs during epochs where helium is already singly - ionized .",
    "we therefore adopt the single - ionization of helium as a general assumption in our calculation .",
    "while this could in principle lead to an overestimate of the he@xmath2 production in epochs where the helium is still neutral , our results show that the latter happens to be inefficient during such times , therefore providing an a posteriori justification . for this study",
    ", we adopt a generic set of cosmological parameters approximately consistent with the recent planck @xcite survey with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 km @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the critical density @xmath27 .",
    "while the main focus of this investigation concerns the epoch of helium reionization , a residual degree of doubly - ionized helium can be produced already in the epoch of recombination . in the absence of dark matter annihilation ,",
    "it is well - known that helium recombines completely and becomes fully neutral .",
    "however , in the presence of dark matter annihilation , there will be an additional ionization term which prevents the he@xmath2 abundances from recombining to zero , and instead a new equilibrium will be established corresponding to a non - zero doubly - ionized ionization degree . as already shown by chluba ( 2009 ) , helium is in the singly - ionized state until @xmath28 .",
    "subsequently , a residual ionization of @xmath29 is maintained in the singly - ionized state . while the recombination rates of he@xmath2 are higher by about a factor of 5 compared to he@xmath3 , residual abundances of up to @xmath30 can nevertheless be maintained .",
    "+ as a minimal model to obtain the residual ionization degree from the recombination epoch , we will in the following consider the ionization due to dark matter annihilation , the recombination to and the collisional ionization of he@xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the processes outlined above , we consider the double - ionization of helium by energetic photons from high - redshift quasars .",
    "as we will show below , these are likely to give the dominant contribution leading to complete helium reionization in the intergalactic medium . the rate at which the mean ionization fraction of he@xmath31 evolves is then given by @xmath32 here , the first term describes the ionization rate due to quasar photons , the second term describes the contribution of dark matter , the third term describes the collisional ionization by thermal electrons and the fourth term describes radiative recombination .",

    ". a linear interpolation is pursued in between .",
    "we note that the baryon clumping factor used here is smaller than in studies of hydrogen reionization @xcite , as helium reionization is strongly driven by rare objects like quasars and therefore proceeds on large spatial scales . + the processes outlined here are important at different cosmological epochs , and will lead to characteristic signatures of the evolution of he@xmath2 at different cosmological times . in particular",
    "the evolution of the recombination and collisional ionization rate depends on the temperature of the gas .",
    "we have used the recfast code @xcite to follow the gas temperature up to @xmath43 and below @xmath43 we assume the igm temperature rises to @xmath44  k during cosmic reionization .",
    "quasars and agns produce hard photons , which substantially contribute to the production of doubly - ionized helium .",

    "the effect of ionization by quasars has been included from @xmath60 since that is the epoch where the first quasars have been observed , and from which we expect the adopted quasar luminosity function to be valid .",
    "the ionizing photons from quasars lead to a rapid double - ionization of helium .",
    "the timescale for this process is much smaller than the timescale for collisional ionization .",

    "the impact of quasars on helium reionization is given in figure  [ [ gra2 ] ] , which shows the evolution of the he@xmath2 fraction as a function of redshift assuming different clumping factors @xmath61 for the baryons .",
    "due to the effect of recombination , the amount of he@xmath2 decreases with the baryonic clumping factor .",
    "while the calculation here implicitly assumes that all quasar spectra are the same , observational investigations have shown that characteristic quasar spectra can be obtained when considering a larger sample of sources , so that a well - defined statistical average exists @xcite .",
    "we expect that the latter will be sufficient to describe the large - scale average of helium reionization .",
    "so far , even the highest - redshift quasar known to date at z=7.085 still shows the same characteristic features as quasars at lower redshift @xcite , therefore providing no evidence for a cosmological evolution .",

    "while this uniform density of dark matter can be a good approximation at early stages , it is expected to clump considerably during structure formation .",

    "the results show a very steep increase of the he@xmath2 fraction as a function of redshift , with helium reionization being completed at @xmath104 .",
    "the latter reflects both the shift of the quasar luminosity function towards higher luminosities , as well as the increase of the quasar abundances at a given luminosity in fig .",
    "[ [ gra1 ] ] .",
    "the results depend only weakly on the baryonic clumping factor in the calculation .",
    "the rate of dark matter annihilation depends on the number density of the dark matter particles given by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , with @xmath107 the critical mass density and @xmath108 .",
    "the dark matter content of our universe may consist of massive cold dark matter particles @xmath109 or warm dark matter with characteristic masses @xmath110  mev . due to the large difference in the masses of warm and cold dark matter ,",

    "[ [ cap1 ] ] , we compare the results when considering the contributions of cold and warm dark matter to helium reionization , finding that the contribution from warm dark matter is clearly enhanced due to the higher annihilation rate .",
    "however , the warm dark matter scenario is ruled out by the planck survey @xcite , so we will subsequently focus on the cold dark matter scenario .",
    "we can generally distinguish a number of characteristic phases in the evolution of he@xmath2 : at @xmath111 , the he@xmath2 abundance decreases but remains non - zero , reflecting the decrease of the annihilation rate and the decrease in the gas temperature , which is initially coupled to the temperature of the cmb . at @xmath112 ,",
    "the effects of dark matter clumping become noticable which starts increasing the dark matter annihilation rate and hence the he@xmath2 fraction , which is further enhanced when the gas temperature increases to @xmath113  k due to hydrogen reionization .",
    "subsequently , we find a further moderate increase until the contribution from quasars kicks in at @xmath114 .",
    "we notice that these phases can be identified both in the calculations with cold and warm dark matter and for all the halo profiles considered , including the nfw , burkert and moore profile .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter clumping factor is given for these cases in fig .",
    "[ [ gra3 ] ] .",
    "as expected , we find the highest clumping factor for the moore profile , which is the steepest density profile , while it is lowest for the burkert profile , in agreement with the study by cumberbatch et al .",
    "we expect that the real dark matter clumping factor will lie in between these extreme cases .",
    "a comparison of the implications of the different clumping factors for the cold dark matter scenario including also a case with a uniform dark matter distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ [ cap2 ] ] .",
    "it is clearly visible that the he@xmath2 abundance is reduced by at least a few orders of magnitude in case of a uniform dm density .",
    "apart from the increase in the he@xmath2 fraction due to the temperature increase at @xmath115 , the evolution of the ionized fraction is generally decreasing with decreasing redshift at @xmath116 , reflecting the decreasing density of dark matter and the decreasing annihilation rate .",
    "this behavior is inverted when clumpy dark matter is considered , as the clumpiness increases with redshift and compensates for the decrease of the mean dark matter density . as a result",
    ", the contribution of dark matter annihilation may rise rapidly at @xmath1 , when also the abundance of luminous quasars is rapidly increasing . at @xmath1 , the fraction of he@xmath2 increases both due to the increased temperature of the igm , as well as due to the increasing dark matter clumping factor , which varies between @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath114 for the scenarios considered here . as a result",
    ", the he@xmath2 abundance is clearly enhanced for clumpy dark matter compared to a uniform distribution , and thus rises more steeply .",
    "a close zoom - in shows that the rise is even steeper for the moore profile compared to nfw or burkert , but then converges from @xmath119 when the abundance from quasars becomes important .",
    "the completion of helium reionization may thus change slightly by @xmath120 due to the additional contribution , even though the latter is hard to distinguish from the expected evolution in the presence of quasars . as the formation of quasars",
    "is expected to follow the build - up of structures , we expect that both contributions may evolve in a similar fashion , thus preventing a significant change in the evolution at late times .",
    "finally , we also checked how the results depend on the adopted integration range when we determine the dark matter clumping factor .",
    "as visible in fig .",
    "[ [ cap3 ] ] , there are mostly minor changes by at most one order of magnitude , even in cases where the integration range is changed by several orders of magnitude .",
    "even though there is a physical uncertainty on the appropriate range to consider , we find that the overall behavior is rather robust and we can again identify the same characteristic phases in these calculations .",
    "we have investigated the impact of self - annihilating clumpy dark matter on the evolution of the he@xmath2 abundance over cosmic history .",
    "we find that the contribution of dark matter is potentially relevant before quasar feedback becomes important , and provides a residual he@xmath2 fraction already at high redshift that depends on the dark matter model .     in models with a uniform dark matter",
    "distribution , the contribution from dark matter annihilation decreases with decreasing redshift due to the decreasing dark matter densities , which is generally reflected in decreasing abundances of he@xmath2 before the feedback from quasars becomes more relevant . in models of clumpy dark matter ,",
    "the clumpiness however increases with time as a result of structure formation , and therefore both the annihilation rate and the he@xmath2 abundance increases with decreasing redshift .",
    "we further note that the thermal evolution of the igm is relevant for the residual abundance of he@xmath2 , as the increased temperatures due to hydrogen reionization give rise to reduced he@xmath2 recombination rates and therefore a higher net abundance .",
    "a similar increase occurs at @xmath1 when the temperature of the igm raises to @xmath121  k. while in the case of a uniform dark matter distribution , the annihilation rate eventually becomes negligible at low redshift , there is a considerable enhancement in the presence of clumpy dark matter , corresponding to a clumping factor of @xmath122 at @xmath114 and a clumping factor of @xmath123 at @xmath124 , which outweighs the decrease of the dark matter density with redshift . as a result",
    ", there can be a substantial contribution at @xmath125 where helium reionization is expected to approach completion .",
    "the effect is however highly degenerate with the contribution from quasars , as both their abundance and peak luminosity is expected to increase towards @xmath126 , reflecting the formation and further growth of cosmological structures .",
    "we therefore expect that such a contribution may be present , even though it should be difficult to infer how much the completion of helium reionization has changed as a result . to determine such potential contributions , it is thus necessary to both accurately map out the evolution of helium reionization , extending current observational studies @xcite , but also to pursue a precise number count of x - ray sources throughout the evolution of the universe , including both compton - thin @xcite and compton - thick @xcite sources . rather than considering the completion of helium reionization , it may be helpful to probe the cosmic evolution of he@xmath2 at earlier stages by extending current studies of the he@xmath3 lyman @xmath4 forest and comparing the latter with the characteristic evolution of the quasar population over time .",
    "it is at least conceivable that the slope of the evolution provides additional information , which will be valuable to distinguish different scenarios .",
    "a further assessment of the uncertainties in the observed population and its implications for the available amount of x - rays for helium reionization will be necessary in this respect .    we note here that our calculations adopted a mass of 80 gev for the dark matter particles , along with a cross - section of @xmath127  @xmath128  s@xmath129 as consistent with the planck data @xcite .",
    "we note that for larger cross sections , the annihilation rate would be enhanced , and the contribution to helium reionization thus more significant , while the effect becomes less important for lower cross sections .",
    "similarly , the mass of the dark matter particles determines their number density .",
    "in such a case , we still expect the same effects to occur , as the dark matter effects considered here depend only on the ratio @xmath130",

    "<S> the reionization of helium describes the transition from its singly ionized state to a doubly - ionized state in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process is important for the thermal evolution of the igm and influences the mean free path of photons with energies above @xmath0  ev . </S>",
    "<S> while it is well - known that helium reionization is mostly driven by the contribution of energetic quasars at @xmath1 , we study here how helium reionization proceeds if there is an additional contribution due to the annihilation of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effects of different dark matter profiles for the dark matter clumping factor , which can significantly enhance the annihilation rate at late times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the presence of dark matter annihilation enhances the he@xmath2 abundance at early stages where it would be zero within the standard model , and it can further increase during structure formation , reflecting the increase of the dark matter clumping factor . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is , however , degenerate with the build - up of the quasar contribution , and we therefore expect no significant changes at late times . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that future studies of the he@xmath3 lyman @xmath4 forest may help to assess whether the evolution is consistent with the contribution from quasars alone , or if an additional component may be required . </S>"
