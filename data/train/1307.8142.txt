    "currently there are @xmath5 known pulsars , the majority in our galaxy and a few in the magellanic clouds .",
    "about 250 pulsars have rotation periods of less than ten milliseconds and are nature s most accurate clocks",
    ". the unique properties of these millisecond pulsars ( msps ) can be exploited to study the exotic state of matter in the interiors of neutron stars , to detect gravitational waves , and to test the theory of general relativity in the strong gravity regime . for detecting gravitational waves using a pulsar timing array ( pta ; e.g. @xcite )",
    ", one needs regular observations of msps that are extremely stable rotators and are , optimally , distributed all over the sky .",
    "most pulsars have been discovered in large radio surveys , but past survey coverage has favored the southern hemisphere and the region within a few degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "the arecibo drift - scan surveys carried out at 430 mhz prior to and during the gregorian dome upgrade in the 1990s covered about 70% of the arecibo sky ( declinations between @xmath6 and 38^@xmath7 , @xcite ) . among",
    "the many pulsars found , some have been extremely important for science in general and radio astronomy in particular .",
    "these include : psr  b1534 + 12 @xcite , the relativistic binary system which has allowed two different tests of general relativity ; psr  b1257 + 12 @xcite , a msp now known to be orbited by three planets and the first extra - solar planetary system discovered ; and psr  j1713 + 0747 @xcite , a bright , stable msp which dominates the sensitivity of the pta @xcite . despite the successes of the arecibo searches made so far , they also had limitations .",
    "the sky was divided into five regions , with each of these observed by a different group .",
    "early observations were made with old equipment , which had coarser time and spectral resolution than is available from current instruments .",
    "data collected during the upgrade were often of variable quality and the different groups were using different search algorithms and methods for interference excision . as a result , widely different success rates in finding new pulsars were reported .",
    "this complicates any efforts to draw inferences about the general pulsar population probed by these surveys .",
    "given the patchy nature of the observations and data processing carried out so far , there is good reason to believe that @xmath8 of the arecibo sky remains to be surveyed , and that many pulsars await discovery @xcite .",
    "this belief is supported by the discovery of 11 new pulsars in an analysis of 430  mhz drift data covering 490 deg@xmath9 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two of the new pulsars have periods @xmath10 ms .",
    "for a few months in 2007 , the green bank telescope ( gbt ) underwent azimuth track repair , which made normal pointed observations impossible , but @xcite and @xcite used @xmath11  h to conduct a 350  mhz drift survey ( gbt350 ) of sky in the declination range between @xmath12 and 2^@xmath7  ( which is mostly inaccessible to the arecibo telescope ) and to a lesser extent at declinations of @xmath13^@xmath7 .",
    "gbt350 has discovered 35 pulsars , including 7 msps .",
    "one of the new msps is in a hierarchical triple system @xcite , one of only two such systems known .",
    "another msp , psr  j1023 + 0038 , was the first object whose evolution from a low - mass x - ray binary to a radio - emitting msp was observed almost in real time over the span of a decade @xcite . a third discovery , the mildly recycled pulsar j0348@xmath140432 , is in a binary system with an orbital period of only 2.4  h , and has the highest precisely measured ns mass , @xmath15  _ @xmath16@xcite .",
    "this makes it a unique lab for testing alternative theories of gravity , because it probes the properties of gravity for the most extreme gravitational fields .",
    "since 2009 , the green bank north celestial cap survey ( gbncc , @xcite ) has searched the sky at declinations @xmath17 ( also inaccessible to the arecibo telescope ) at 350  mhz and has discovered 62 new pulsars , including 9 msps .",
    "the results of gbt350 and gbncc demonstrate the excellent scientific potential of high - latitude pulsar surveys .    in section  [ sec_survey ]",
    "we discuss the current status of ao327 in terms of sky coverage , sensitivity , and search volume , and we make comparisons with the green bank low - frequency surveys .",
    "section  [ sec_new ] focuses on the 24 new pulsars discovered by ao327 so far , and section  [ sec_future ] presents our plans and projections for the next few years that will be necessary to survey the entire arecibo sky at 327  mhz .",
    "the 1-minute effective integration time of an arecibo drift survey at 327  mhz means that it is sensitive to very tight relativistic binaries even with only moderate acceleration searches .",
    "the double pulsar j0737@xmath183039 has an orbital period of 2.46  h and was found in a parkes survey with an integration time of 265  s without using an acceleration search during data processing @xcite .",
    "this means that for similar flux densities , companion masses , and spin periods , ao327 is sensitive to comparable binaries with orbital periods of @xmath19  h with a conventional periodicity search , and to even shorter - period comparable binaries if using acceleration search .",
    "pulsars in tight relativistic binaries with orbital periods of a few hours or less can be timed very well at arecibo , where the maximum source tracking time is @xmath20  h.    we conducted a pilot 327  mhz drift survey at arecibo in 2003 for 100  h. the frequency , lower than used in previous arecibo drift surveys , was chosen because pulsars tend to have power - law spectra that decline steeply with increasing frequency ( @xmath21 , with average @xmath22 ) .",
    "it also anticipated the installation of a new , cooled 327  mhz receiver , which was eventually commissioned in 2006 .",
    "this pilot survey used the older wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp , @xcite ) backend and discovered three pulsars ( table  [ tab_new ] , figure  [ fig_coverage ] ) .    ]    with the cooled 327  mhz receiver and the mock spectrometer available , we began taking data during a lengthy repair of the telescope platform in 2010 , which restricted telescope movement for several months .",
    "the mock spectrometer allows us to collect data from a 57  mhz bandwidth as opposed to 25  mhz for the wapp - based pilot survey and has a better response to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) than the older backend .    in 2012 , the arecibo observatory acquired a new backend , the puerto rico ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( puppi ) , which is a clone of the similarly named guppi at green bank .",
    "puppi provides a `` fast4k '' search mode , allowing recording of 4096 channels with a minimum sampling time of 81.92  @xmath3s .",
    "after puppi control is integrated into the arecibo telescope observing software , ao327 will begin using puppi for regular survey observations . in the meantime ,",
    "we have successfully used puppi in this mode to confirm some of the new pulsars in table  [ tab_new ] , and in coherent dedispersion mode we will use it for timing ao327 discoveries . because of hardware constraints , the smallest bandwidth available with puppi is 100  mhz , while the 327  mhz receiver bandwidth is 67  mhz .",
    "a modification in the puppi datataking software will allow us to record data only from the 68  mhz receiver bandwidth although the 4096 channels of the `` fast4k '' mode cover 100  mhz .",
    "this accounts for the 2816 channels listed in table  [ tab_surveys ] for the future ao327 puppi setup .",
    ".low - frequency survey parameters used in comparison.[tab_surveys ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath23 ra and dec are given in the j2000 coordinate system .",
    "the uncertainties in both coordinates are 7.5^@xmath24 , the 327  mhz beam radius , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the positions with smaller uncertainties were obtained from follow - up observations at 1.4  ghz .",
    "+ @xmath25 found in ao327 pilot data from 2003 .",
    "we have described the current status and initial set of pulsar discoveries from the ao327 arecibo drift survey .",
    "phase i of the survey includes sky in the declination range @xmath0 to @xmath1 , excluding the region with @xmath26 , which is searched by the palfa consortium at 1.4  ghz , a frequency better suited to the high - scattering and dispersion environment of the galactic plane . to date",
    "we have completed observations of 52% of the phase i region , processed 55% of the data , and discovered 24 new pulsars .",
    "we expect that most of the remaining phase i region will be searched with the new puppi backend , which provides finer time and frequency resolution , wider bandwidth , and therefore better sensitivity , especially to msps .",
    "based on the current time ao327 time allocation of @xmath27  hours per year , we expect to complete phase i of the survey by 2017 .",
    "phase ii of ao327 will target sky in the declination range @xmath4 and we estimate that will take two additional years to complete .",
    "four of the 24 ao327 discoveries have @xmath28 , and one of these , psr  j1821 + 01 , has @xmath29",
    "s. this pulsar is outside the palfa search region within 5^@xmath7of the galactic plane .",
    "the fact that ao327 is finding fast pulsars at relatively low galactic latitudes suggests that a non - drift search probing deeper parallel to the galactic plane at @xmath30 will likely be very fruitful and contribute to a more complete picture of the galactic pulsar population .",
    "when ao327 discovers a new pulsar , we routinely check for nearby sources from existing optical and high - energy catalogs , including the second fermi source catalog ( 2fgl , @xcite ) .",
    "radio pulsar searches targeting unidentified 2fgl sources with pulsar - like gamma - ray spectra have shown that msps are common gamma - ray emitters ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , none of the pulsars in table  [ tab_new ] have 2fgl counterparts .",
    "conversely , once we obtain timing solutions from radio timing observations , we plan to use them to fold fermi event data and check whether any of the ao327 pulsars exhibit gamma - ray pulsations , which may be too weak for the objects to have been included in 2fgl .",
    "the ratio of radio - loud to radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars is an especially good discriminator between gamma - ray pulsar population models , and radio surveys and multi - wavelength follow - up studies of new pulsars will make such distinction possible .",
    "the arecibo observatory is operated by sri international under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation ( ast-1100968 ) , and in alliance with ana g. mndez - universidad metropolitana , and the universities space research association .",
