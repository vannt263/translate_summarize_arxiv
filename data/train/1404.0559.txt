    "galaxy discs have been known to follow an exponential decline in the radial surface brightness since the study by @xcite .",
    "disc formation is thought to be closely connected to the initial formation of galaxies , the exponential nature being a result of comparable time - scales for viscous evolution and star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the outermost faint regions of galaxies were first studied in detail in edge - on systems by @xcite , who found that the exponential decay of the surface brightness does not always continue infinitely outwards . instead a sharp change was found with a much steeper surface brightness decline in the outermost parts of the disc .",
    "more recently the advance in observations has enabled detailed studies of the faint outer regions of more face - on disc galaxies .",
    "similar , yet not as sharp changes in the surface brightness profiles have been found in many face - on galaxies in the optical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in the infrared ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , most discs are found to be best described as double exponentials with a change of slope between the two exponential subsections .",
    "discs can thus be divided into three main types ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : single exponential discs with no break ( type i ) , discs where the slope is steeper beyond the break ( type ii ) , and discs where the outer slope is shallower ( type iii ) .",
    "the type ii breaks in face - on galaxies generally appear much further in than the `` truncations '' in edge - on galaxies ( see for example @xcite ) , thus most likely representing a different feature .",
    "one of the first explanations for type ii breaks in the surface brightness profiles was given by @xcite , relating it to angular momentum conservation during the initial collapse of the gas during the galaxy formation .",
    "an alternative explanation involves bars , via the influence of the outer lindblad resonance , which is connected to the formation of outer rings ( classified as `` ii.o - olr '' , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite noted that in some galaxies with outer rings the break radius of a type ii profile is similar to the radius of the outer ring .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a star formation threshold have also been associated with type ii profiles in galaxies in which the break radius is larger than the outer ring radius ( type `` ii.o - ct '' , @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , possible connections between breaks and different structural components , such as rings and spirals , have not yet been systematically studied .",
    "studies of disc breaks in galaxies have become increasingly important with the discovery of stellar migration in discs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of migration has changed the paradigm that stars born in the disc do not travel radially far from their place of birth . on the contrary , stars can travel several kiloparsecs radially both inwards and outwards .",
    "evidence of this process has been found in the solar neighbourhood , where the wide metallicity and age distributions of stars @xcite can be explained by radial migration @xcite .",
    "the effects of star formation and radial migration can not necessarily be considered separately ( e.g. @xcite ) . in these simulations",
    "the type ii break is caused by a drop of the star formation rate beyond the break due to the reduced amount of cooled gas .",
    "however , the outer disc is simultaneously populated by stars radially migrating from the inner disc . in older stellar populations",
    "the outer slope is shallower than in younger populations , possibly being a result of more extended radial spreading due to the longer duration of stellar migration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "colour profiles have also shown that especially for type ii profiles the discs become increasingly redder after the break radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , also consistent with stellar migration .",
    "this interpretation is not unique because in the fully cosmological simulations @xcite see reddening beyond a break radius in the disc also without stellar migration , and argue that it could simply be due to a change in the star formation rate around the break . in their simulation",
    "the presence of stellar migration can smooth the mass profile of the galaxy up to a point where it appears as a single exponential .",
    "however , using similar simulations @xcite noted that cosmological simulations can not yet definitely tell the relative roles of radial migration and star formation in the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "alternatively , the larger radial velocity dispersion of old stars ( e.g. for solar neighbourhood @xcite ) could also explain the observed properties of the outer discs up to a point .",
    "type iii profiles remain more ambiguous .",
    "sometimes they are associated with an outer spheroidal or halo component in the galaxy , thus not being a disc feature at all ( type `` iii - s '' , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has proposed that @xmath3 of type iii profiles could also be created by superposition of a thin and thick disc , when the scalelength of the thick disc is larger than that of the thin disc .",
    "extended uv emission has been found in many galaxies beyond the optical disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in such cases",
    "the increased star formation at the outskirts of the galaxies could give rise to some of the observed type iii profiles .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing possibility of type iii profile formation comes from the environmental effects .",
    "galaxies live in a hierarchical universe where galaxy mergers are common .",
    "these mergers , and also mild gravitational interactions , between galaxies can certainly change the appearance of the involved galaxies .",
    "already in the early simulations of @xcite close encounters between galaxies were shown to significantly perturb the outer discs of the involved galaxies , and as a result tidal tails and bridges formed .",
    "they also showed that the masses of the galaxies affect the outcome , and the less massive galaxy is more strongly perturbed .",
    "furthermore , predictions from more recent simulations have shown that type iii profiles could be a result of minor mergers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite made the first attempt to examine the galaxy environments of the different break types by counting the number of neighbouring galaxies from sdss within 1 mpc projected radius , for a recession velocity difference to the target galaxy of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 , and absolute magnitude of @xmath6 magnitudes .",
    "they concluded that their criteria for the environment were often too harsh to truly characterise it .",
    "more recently @xcite compared field and cluster galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , and found no differences in the break types in different environments .",
    "however , they focused only on the outermost disc regions and possibly missed a significant fraction of profile breaks .",
    "therefore , the question of the influence of galaxy environment on disc profile type remains open .",
    "we study the disc and break parameters measured from the radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "we aim to systematically associate disc breaks with specific structural components of galaxies , such as rings , lenses , and spirals .",
    "in addition , we perform a detailed environmental analysis searching for possible connections among the different disc profile types with the galaxy density and the presence of nearby perturbers . as a database we use 3.6 @xmath0 images from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath1 g , @xcite ) and @xmath2-band images from the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey ( nirs0s , @xcite ) .",
    "the 3.6 @xmath0 and @xmath2-band images are basically free of extinction , particularly at the large disc radii of most interest here .",
    "both bands trace the old stellar population , which is important because of the expected wavelength dependency of the disc scalelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the environmental analysis we use the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalog ( xsc , @xcite ) and the 2 micron all sky survey redshift survey ( rsc , @xcite ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sample - selection ]",
    "we introduce the sample selection criteria for our study , in section [ analysis - methods ] we describe the data processing , the analysis methods , and the classification of the profile types . in section",
    "[ env - ana - methods ] we describe the environmental study . in sections [ results ] and",
    "[ env_effects ] we present the main results of the surface brightness profile analysis and the results of the environmental analysis , respectively .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ discussion ] , and summarised in section [ sum - conclusion ] .",
    "the general parameters of the galaxies , including the environmental parameters , are presented in appendix [ app : sample ] in table [ app : a ] , and the parameters of the discs and breaks in table [ app : b ] .",
    "we use the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath1 g , @xcite ) which consists of more than 2300 galaxies observed at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 wavelengths with the irac instrument @xcite .",
    "the sample for the survey was selected using values from hyperleda @xcite , for the radial velocity ( @xmath8 km s@xmath5 ) , the total corrected blue magnitude ( @xmath9 ) , the isophotal angular diameter in blue ( @xmath10 arcmin ) , and the galactic latitude ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "many gas poor early - type galaxies do not have radio based measurements of the radial velocities in hyperleda , and so are not part of the s@xmath1 g sample . to fill this gap ,",
    "we include the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey ( nirs0s , @xcite ) in our study .",
    "nirs0s is a @xmath2-band study and the sample selection is based on the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite for the morphological types @xmath12 , total magnitude @xmath13 mag , and inclination @xmath14 .",
    "additional galaxies slightly fainter than using the main selection criteria are included in the nirsos sample , so that in total the full sample contains 215 galaxies ( 13 ellipticals , 139 s0s , 30 s0/a , 33 sa , and one later type galaxy ) . nirs0s",
    "partly overlaps with the s@xmath1 g survey , having 93 galaxies in common .    to select our sample from these two surveys we use the following selection criteria :    * hubble stage @xmath15 from buta et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for s@xmath1 g galaxies and from @xcite for nirs0s galaxies , * galaxy magnitude in @xmath2-band @xmath16 , taken from 2mass ( isophotal apparent magnitude measured within an elliptical aperture defined at @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath18 isophote @xcite ) , * minor / major axis ratio of the disc @xmath19 .",
    "the very late - type disc galaxies ( @xmath20 ) are excluded because the study of disc structures becomes increasingly harder due to their patchy nature .",
    "the above magnitude limit is used because the completeness limit in the 2mass redshift survey @xcite is 11.75 magnitudes in the @xmath2-band . with this selection",
    "we are able to search the environments for neighbouring galaxies that are at most two magnitudes fainter than the primary galaxies ( see also section [ quantifying ] ) .",
    "the inclination criterion is applied because we want to restrict to nearly face - on or moderately inclined galaxies , for which the profile shapes can be determined in a reliable manner . for galaxies that appear both in s@xmath1",
    "g and nirs0s we use the s@xmath1 g images because they are deeper . for s@xmath1 g galaxies we chose to use the 3.6 @xmath0 images , due to the wavelength range being closer to the @xmath2-band used in nirs0s .",
    "this results in a sample of 439 galaxies , 336 from s@xmath1 g and 103 from nirs0s .",
    "we exclude 111 galaxies for which the surface brightness profile analysis was unreliable , due to bright foreground stars in or near the disc , or when there are large gradients in the image .",
    "the final sample has 328 galaxies , 248 from s@xmath1 g and 80 from nirs0s .",
    "the histogram in figure [ sample_histo ] displays the final distribution of the hubble types , and absolute @xmath21-band magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the general properties of the galaxies are listed in appendix table [ app : a ] .",
    "the data processing and analysis of the s@xmath1 g images consists of four pipelines @xcite through which all the galaxies in the survey are processed .",
    "the first pipeline ( p1 ) creates the mosaicked science ready images .",
    "the second pipeline ( p2 ) uses sextractor @xcite to create masks for the foreground stars and image artefacts .",
    "these masks were also visually inspected and edited if necessary .",
    "the third pipeline ( p3 ) performs automated photometry .",
    "the basic parameters of the s@xmath1 g galaxies in our sample ( centre , orientation , ellipticity , background level ) were obtained from pipeline four performed on the 3.6 @xmath0 images ( p4 , salo et al . in preparation ) , which produces two dimensional multi - component decompositions of the galaxies . in p4 the background sky level",
    "is measured in 10 - 20 locations outside the galaxy and a mean of the medians is calculated .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath22 , of the sky measurements is also calculated .",
    "p4 also gives the position angles and inclinations of the discs .",
    "we check visually that the orientation parameters used for the disc do not erroneously correspond to large spherical halos .",
    "the measurement regions are mostly outside possible outer rings , in which region the discs are likely to be close to axisymmetric . in cases where the galaxy seems to end at an outer ring , the orientation and ellipticity of the outer disc",
    "are considered uncertain ( @xmath23 of the s@xmath1 g galaxies in the sample , e.g. ngc2859 ) . however , even in these cases the measurements were included in further analysis .",
    "detailed morphological classifications of the s@xmath1 g galaxies are taken from @xcite and buta et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , which are used to identify the structural components .    for the nirs0s galaxies we use the cleaned and flux calibrated @xmath2-band images @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath22 , galaxy centres , position angles , disc inclinations , and the morphological classification are from @xcite .",
    "the break features in the galactic discs are studied using azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles .",

    "aperture correction was not applied to the surface brightness profiles of s@xmath1 g galaxies ( see the irac handbook , and @xcite ) because in our tests the effect was found to be insignificant compared to other error sources . from the flux calibrated nirs0s images the surface brightness can be calculated as : @xmath25 the flux calibration of the nirs0s images is based on the 2mass vega system . in order to convert the nirs0s surface brightnesses to the ab - system and to evaluate colour differences we took all 93 galaxies common in nirs0s and s@xmath1 g .",
    "we calculated the total magnitudes of the galaxies inside the elliptical apertures defined by the surface brightness level of @xmath26 mag arcsec@xmath18 in the s@xmath1 g images , for both surveys .",
    "the median difference in the aperture magnitudes between nirs0s and s@xmath1 g was found to be 2.566 .",
    "although the magnitude difference depends also on the 3.6 - 2.2 @xmath0 colour of the galaxy , the relation was found to be very linear with colour ( see fig .",
    "[ aperture_correction ] left panel ) . after adding the conversion factor to the nirs0s surface brightnesses , the profiles derived from the images of both surveys are very similar ( see fig .",
    "[ aperture_correction ] right panel ) , except that the s@xmath1 g images are on average about two magnitudes deeper ( see fig .",
    "4 . in @xcite ) .",
    "all surface brightness profiles and magnitudes of the nirs0s galaxies are converted with this value for the rest of this study .",
    "the sky measurement uncertainty starts to affect the surface brightness profiles at large radii .",
    "the region of the surface brightness profile that falls below the level defined by the standard deviation of the sky ( @xmath22 ) was excluded from the analysis .",
    "when it is obvious that the outermost region of the profile is uncertain , the outer limit was taken to be before the limit defined by @xmath22 was reached .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles can be typically followed out to a surface brightness of @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath18 for the s@xmath1 g galaxies , and @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath18 for the nirs0s galaxies , in both cases expressed in 3.6 @xmath0 ab magnitudes .      to derive the properties of the discs we adopted the methods used in the previous studies of disc breaks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we ignore the inner regions ( @xmath29 ) of the radial surface brightness profiles , where the bulges / bars / inner rings dominate . to recover the properties of the discs , different model functions , depending on the profile shape , are fitted to the radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "the model functions we use to derive the parameters of the discs are the exponential function @xcite , the double - exponential function introduced by @xcite , and the generalization of this introduced by @xcite . the exponential function is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface brightness in the centre of the disc , and @xmath32 , the scalelength of the disc .",
    "the double - exponential function is the following @xmath33^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha }   \\left ( \\frac{1}{h_i } - \\frac{1}{h_o } \\right ) } .",

    "the parameter @xmath38 is a scaling factor @xmath39 some of the galaxies in our sample have two breaks ( i.e. three exponential sections ) , and for those we use a generalization of function [ function_2 ] @xmath40^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{i-1,i } } \\left ( \\frac{1}{h_{i-1}}-\\frac{1}{h_i } \\right ) } \\right\\rbrace ,    \\label{function_3}\\ ] ] where the scaling factor @xmath38 is @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{i-1,i } } \\left ( \\frac{1}{h_{i-1 } } -\\frac{1}{h_i } \\right ) }    \\right\\rbrace .\\ ] ] here the parameter @xmath42 defines the number of exponential sections in the disc , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the exponential scalelengths inside and outside of the break , @xmath45 is the break radius between the exponential sections with slopes @xmath43 and @xmath34 , and @xmath46 controls the sharpness of that break .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is again the central surface brightness of the innermost section .",
    "these functions were fitted to the surface brightness profiles using the idl program _ mpcurvefit _",
    "@xcite , which uses a non - linear least squares method for fitting .",
    "the free parameters in the fits are the disc central surface brightnesses , scalelengths , and the break radii .",
    "the parameter describing the smoothness of the break is kept fixed with a value of @xmath47 , which is a typical value found for this parameter ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fitting was done in the following steps :    1 .",
    "the inner limit of the fit range , @xmath48 , is visually identified from the images and the radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "the region inside @xmath48 is not included in the fit .",
    "figure [ prototypes ] illustrates how the inner radius is selected for three galaxies .",
    "the inner limits are drawn with vertical dashed lines , while the visual estimates of bar lengths ( if a bar is present ) are indicated with vertical triple - dot dashed lines .",
    "the outer limit of the fit range , @xmath49 , is defined as the point after which the sky measurement uncertainty starts to dominate . in some cases",
    "it was selected visually when it was obvious that there was a contamination in the image , as discussed in section [ fitting ] .",
    "3 .   the user identifies the number of sections with exponential slopes .",
    "that also determines which model function needs to be used ( function [ function_1 ] , [ function_2 ] or [ function_3 ] ) .",
    "4 .   in the case of a single exponential profile",
    "the function 3 is fitted to the range defined by [ @xmath48 , @xmath49 ] .",
    "5 .   in case of a more complicated profile ,",
    "the initial values of the fit are first estimated by having the user define segments for different exponential slopes in the profile .",
    "then a single exponential profile is fit independently to each of these segments .",
    "the values of the central surface brightness and the disc scalelength are then used as initial values , either for the function [ function_2 ] or [ function_3 ] , which is fit to the range defined by [ @xmath48 , @xmath49 ] .",
    "possibly the largest source of uncertainty in the disc parameters is due to the selection of the galaxy region where the different functions are fitted ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we follow a monte carlo approach to estimate how the fit region selection affects the parameters of the discs . in practice",
    "we vary the fit region delimiters ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) in an range centred to the original user selected value that has a width of @xmath51 , and draw 500 new values for the region delimiters using an uniform distribution .",
    "the surface brightness profile is then automatically fitted with these region delimiter values , and the standard deviation @xmath52 of the disc parameters are calculated .",
    "the radius defined by the @xmath53 mag arcsec@xmath18 was selected because this level can be reached also with the shallower nirs0s data .",
    "the type of the profile ( single exponential , one break , or two breaks ) is the same as the user selected , and the initial values for the fit are also the same .",
    "the parameters from the fits and the calculated uncertainties ( @xmath54 ) are shown in the appendix table [ app : b ] .",
    "the reported uncertainties take into account the possibility of including some of the bulge or the bar region which we try to avoid .",
    "in addition , the outer limit of the fit region can extend further out than achieved with the sky uncertainty criteria described above .",
    "therefore possible contribution of the background sky variation is also included in the uncertainties .",
    "the profiles were classified using the main break types i , ii , or iii , and in case of multiple breaks , with a combination of types ii and iii ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , based on the behaviour of the disc scalelengths .",
    "type i is the classical single exponential disc .",
    "type ii is a downbending dual - exponential disc , where the outer disc has a lower disc scalelength than the inner disc .",
    "type iii is an upbending dual - exponential disc , where the outer disc has a larger scalelength than the inner disc .",
    "examples of the three disc types are shown in figure [ prototypes ] .    in previous studies , types ii and iii",
    "have also been divided into several subtypes . for type ii discs this is based on the location of the break in relation to the bar length : when the break is at , or inside , the bar radius it is called ii.i , and in cases where the break is beyond the bar radius it is called ii.o @xcite .",
    "we use the ii.i class to separate these profiles from pure type i and ii.o profiles , which both are intrinsically different from type ii.i .",
    "we classify the type ii.o profiles as type ii without separating the subclasses ii.o - olr and ii.o - ct .",
    "we use similar approach with the type iii profiles and do not use the subclasses iii - d and iii - s .",
    "the profile types for each galaxy are presented in appendix table [ app : b ] .",
    "for the environmental analysis we use the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc , @xcite ) as a basis , due to its completeness in the local universe .",
    "we used objects having apparent @xmath2-band isophotal magnitudes measured in elliptical apertures defined at @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath18 isophote ( k_m_k20fe ) , and semi - major axis length corresponding to this isophote ( r_k20fe ) .",
    "all the angular distances between galaxies used in the environmental analysis are calculated from the xsc coordinates .",
    "redshifts for the xsc objects come from the 2mass redshift survey ( rsc , @xcite ) , and are 97.6% complete for the xsc galaxies up to @xmath55 mag ( 44,599 galaxies ) .",
    "the data release also includes redshifts for 196,963 xsc galaxies that are beyond their main catalog limits of the redshift survey ( i.e. @xmath56 mag , @xmath57 mag , or near the galactic plane ) .",
    "the rsc matches the previous large redshift surveys with the xsc objects , and therefore no additional cross - matching between the xsc and other databases is necessary .",
    "we have evaluated galactic environments using two complementary parameters , the projected surface number density of the neighbouring galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the dahari - parameter @xcite , which estimates the tidal interaction strength between galaxies .",
    "these parameters were calculated using galaxies that are found in an area defined by a projected radius of 1 mpc at the distance of the primary galaxy , and within a recession velocity interval of @xmath58 km s@xmath5 around the primary galaxy . in galaxy",
    "poor environments the radius of the search area was increased in 1 mpc steps until there are at least three companion galaxies in the area , while still keeping the velocity interval at @xmath58 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this results in 229 galaxies having 1 mpc search radius , 45 with 2 mpc , 16 with 3 mpc , and 6 with 4 mpc .",
    "the redshift completeness for the environments were estimated by restricting to xsc galaxies in the search areas .",
    "then , in 0.5 @xmath2-band magnitude bins , the number of galaxies that have a redshift available was divided by the number of all xsc galaxies within the bin .",
    "the resulting histograms for the redshift completeness in these bins , as well as the number of xsc galaxies , are shown in figure [ areas_rs ] .",
    "we confirm that the redshift data is essentially complete for the xsc galaxies up to @xmath2-band magnitude @xmath59 , as also stated in @xcite for the rsc as a whole .",
    "the projected surface density of galaxies , using the previously described restriction for the neighbouring galaxies , was calculated with the formula : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the projected distance to the third nearest neighbour galaxy , given in mpc .",
    "we use the logarithm in this parameter because of the large variation of this parameter among the galaxies . the surface density estimated at the radius of the third nearest neighbouring galaxy",
    "was selected because it probes the density in small galaxy groups .",
    "estimators using distances to the tenth nearest galaxy work better for surface densities in larger groups or in galaxy clusters , as discussed in @xcite ( e.g. 24 of our sample galaxies are members of virgo ) .",
    "we use the dahari parameter ( @xmath63 , @xcite ) to estimate the gravitational interaction strength .",

    "[ rings_breaks ] ) .",
    "this is natural if the outer lenses are also largely resonance structures , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "additionally , we see a connection between the inner rings and type ii breaks in those galaxies in which no outer rings or lenses are visible ( see fig .",

    "[ rings_breaks_histo ] ) . while some of this change could be explained by a slightly lower bar fraction compared to early - type galaxies ( @xmath102 ) , the bar fraction in type ii profiles in late - type spirals is still as high as @xmath153 ( see fig . [ break_distribution_simple ] lower middle panel ) and",

    "galaxies where the breaks are connected with the apparent outer radii of spiral structures comprise @xmath156 of all type ii profiles . in these cases",
    "the galaxy extends outwards from the break radius , but the outer region is featureless .",
    "this featureless region could consist of migrating old stars .",
    "some evidence of migration is found in the colour profiles of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where for type ii profiles the discs outside the break get increasingly redder , indicating older stellar populations . in principle",
    "it is also possible that the outer discs are redder simply because of a change in the star formation profile of the disc , without any need for stellar radial migration @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite claim that migration would remove the break from the stellar mass distribution .",
    "this is inconsistent with our results which show a similar fraction of type ii breaks ( see table [ overall - stat ] ) in the near infrared ( and thus in the stellar mass distribution ) , as is seen in the previous studies in the optical wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "simulations and star count observations of ngc7793 by @xcite show that the ratio of the outer and inner disc scalelengths ( @xmath115 ) increase with older stellar populations ( i.e. the break gets smoother ) , as the oldest stars have had more time to migrate to radii where less in - situ star formation is expected .",
    "thus , also the break in the stellar mass profile of the galaxy is smoothed , but they found that the break remains visible in the radial surface brightness profile of the old stellar population that matches the @xmath157 profiles of our study .",
    "similar behaviour with increasing stellar age was not seen in the simulations of @xcite without taking migration into account .",
    "it is worth noting that for these type ii profiles , associated with the outer edges of spiral structure , value of @xmath158 is in agreement with the value of 2.6 derived from the simulation models for radial migration by @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of stellar populations is beyond the scope of this paper .          in approximately one third of type iii profiles",
    "we could associate the break radius directly to galaxy structures like inner / outer lenses , or outer rings .",
    "multiple exponential subsections associated with lenses have been previously studied by @xcite and @xcite , in the early - type disc galaxies .",
    "they showed that in such galaxies the exponential subsections appear at fairly high surface brightnesses .",
    "our result fit into this picture as some of the type iii breaks are indeed at relatively high surface brightnesses , and also because the type iii breaks connected with the structural components appear at a fairly small radius ( figs .",

    "other structural components have also been proposed to create the type iii profiles .",
    "@xcite found , using deep optical images for a small sample of face - on galaxies , that stellar halos systematically produce type iii profiles at surface brightness levels of @xmath159 mag arcsec@xmath18 .",
    "this surface brightness level corresponds roughly to a surface brightness of @xmath160 mag arcsec@xmath18 , and is typically one magnitude fainter than the reach of our data .",
    "nevertheless , bright stellar halos are seen in some galaxies in the s@xmath1 g sample .",
    "additionally , the superposition of thin and thick discs has been proposed by @xcite to create some of the type iii profiles .",
    "the type iii profile would be formed when the thin disc has a lower scalelength than the thick disc .",
    "in addition to the formation scenarios mentioned above , star formation in extended gas discs might also be involved , in at least some fraction of the type iii breaks .",
    "the discovery of extended uv - discs , that continue far beyond the optical discs , indicates the presence of star formation at large galactocentric distances in about 25% of disc galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in some of the cases",
    "the extended uv - discs might be a result of galaxy interactions ( for example m83 , @xcite ) , but often the galaxies are isolated .      in figure",

    "[ hin_muin ] ( lower panel ) the types i and ii overlap with each other in scalelength . the inner parts of type ii profiles are flatter than the single exponential profiles .",

    "manifestations of environmental effect will be discussed in section [ env - disc ] .",
    "@xcite compared the disc scalelength ( @xmath118 ) and the central surface brightness ( @xmath117 ) of the inner and outer parts of type ii and iii profiles , to the values of type i profiles .",
    "they divided their sample to early ( @xmath161 ) and late - type galaxies ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "contrary to our study , they found that in both hubble type bins the inner discs of type ii profiles are similar to those of type i profiles .",

    "the outer disc scalelengths of type ii profiles are similar to type i discs ( @xmath164 ) .",

    "[ hin_muin ] , lower panel ) show no connection with the structural components of the galaxies or with the galaxy absolute magnitudes .",
    "thus , the scatter could be related to various formation scenarios of the breaks . in principle",
    "it could be due to small fitting errors in the outermost parts of the discs that influence the extrapolated disc central surface brightnesses ( see also @xcite ) . however , our estimated uncertainties are not large enough to explain this scatter .      associating disc breaks with the different morphological structures , and considering the scaling relations discussed above , it is obvious that bars must play an important role in redistributing matter in galactic discs .",
    "bars can transfer angular momentum among stars and therefore cause the disc to spread , while the gas in the disc is driven towards the bar resonances ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in section [ ii_dis_comp ] we discussed that nearly a half ( @xmath165 % ) of type ii profiles are connected with outer rings and that a correlation exists with the break radius and the inner ring radius , which are thought to be formed at the bar resonances .",

    "we also find that the seven type ii breaks ( out of 66 type ii breaks associated with outer rings ) connected with outer rings , appear in non - barred galaxies .",
    "formation of rings in non - barred galaxies is not well understood , but based on our study they are similarly connected with the type ii breaks as in barred galaxies .",

    "this could be a manifestation of the well known morphology - density relation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : the early - type galaxies live in denser galaxy environments , where the tidal effects are more frequent .",
    "early - type disc galaxies are also on average slightly brighter which could explain the larger scalelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , as no correlation was found between @xmath118 and the galaxy density parameter , @xmath119 , it is more likely that the type i profiles are created in small galaxy groups where the tidal effects are efficient in modifying the discs . alternatively they could be relics of major mergers .",
    "however , based on our study alone , it has not been ruled out that a majority of type i profiles were relics of initial disc formation , from the epoch where galaxy halos controlled the relation between the scalelength and galaxy brightness .    for type iii profiles we find that both the inner ( @xmath34 ) and the outer ( @xmath35 ) disc scalelength correlate with the dahari parameter ( fig .",
    "[ dahari_outer ] right panels ) : when the tidal effect increases , both scalelengths increase .",
    "the increase in @xmath35 with increasing tidal force is consistent with the picture in which the companion galaxies disturb the outer discs creating the observed type iii profiles .",
    "what happens to the outer disc depends strongly on the orbital parameters of the encounter , the gas content , and the relative masses of the encountering galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , the type iii profile could be a result of a tidal encounter when the main galaxy has a significant supply of gas , and the encounter occurs in a prograde orbit with moderate orbital angular momentum . in the above picture similar increase in @xmath34 of type iii profiles with increasing tidal force , is less clear .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite predict that in a minor merger @xmath34 remains similar to the initial disc before the encounter , increasing only @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that rotationally supported inner components ( e.g. discs and rings ) can be formed from the accreted material of the satellite galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the observed properties of type iii profiles could , at least partly , be triggered by tidal encounters in small galaxy groups .",
    "we did not find similar correlations between the surface density of the galaxies ( @xmath119 ) and the parameters of the disc s breaks .",
    "it means that tidal interactions with the nearby companions are more likely to affect the discs than the surrounding galaxy density .",
    "this could also explain why in the previous studies of @xcite and @xcite no connections were found with the profile types and the environment .",
    "they used more global measures of galaxy density ( number of galaxies in an aperture , field / cluster comparison ) that do not directly tell if the primary galaxy has a close companion .",
    "we present a detailed study of the disc surface brightness profiles of 248 galaxies using the 3.6 @xmath0 images that form part of the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath1 g , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , 80 galaxies were taken from the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey ( nirs0s , @xcite , observed at @xmath2-band ) . using the radial surface brightness profiles we measured the properties of the main disc break type , first defined by @xcite .",
    "we associate the breaks with possible structural components in these galaxies using existing size measurements of rings and lenses .",
    "in addition , we carried out an environmental study of the sample galaxies using the 2 micron all sky survey extended source catalog ( xsc ) , and the 2 micron all sky survey redshift survey ( rsc ) , and calculated the parameters describing the environmental galaxy density ( @xmath119 ) and the dahari parameter ( @xmath63 ) for the tidal interaction strength .",
    "our main results are summarised as follows :    * the fractions of the different profile types in the near infrared ( @xmath172 and @xmath2-band ) are : type i @xmath173 % , type ii @xmath174 % , and type iii @xmath175 % .",
    "we find also type ii.i profiles in @xmath176 % of the sample . in seven galaxies",
    "we see two breaks .",
    "these galaxies are counted twice and explain why the total percentage exceeds 100 % . *",
    "the inner parts of type iii profiles are found to resemble the single exponential discs , while for type ii it is the outer disc that more closely resemble the single exponential discs .",
    "this suggests that in galaxies with type ii profile the evolution of the inner parts of the galaxy has been more significant , while in type iii profiles the outer disc has gone through substantial evolution .",
    "* @xmath177 of type ii profiles can be directly connected to outer lenses ( @xmath105 ) , or to the outer rings , pseudorings , and ringlenses ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "almost all of the type ii profiles with hubble types @xmath150 are associated to these structures , with break radii that are coincident with the location of these structures .",
    "therefore in galaxies of hubble types @xmath150 the breaks are most likely associated to the resonances of bars .",
    "* @xmath111 of type ii profiles can be visually connected to either the outer edges of intense star formation in the spiral arms or to the apparent outer radii of the spirals .",
    "these profiles appear mainly in hubble types @xmath162 , where they explain nearly all of type ii profiles . *",
    "only approximately 1/3 of type iii profiles could be associated with distinct morphological structures in the galaxies , such as lenses or outer rings . * for type iii profiles a correlation was found between inner and outer disc scalelengths ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and the dahari parameter ( @xmath63 ) , indicating that nearby galaxy encounters are partly causing the upbending part of these profiles . *",
    "the disc scalelengths ( @xmath118 ) and central surface brightnesses ( @xmath117 ) of the inner- and outer discs were found to be similar in barred and non - barred galaxies when the main types ( i , ii , iii ) are studied individually .",
