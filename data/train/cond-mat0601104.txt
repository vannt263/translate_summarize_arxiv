    "glassy and liquid assemblies of particles in two and three dimensions have been shown to exhibit dynamical heterogeneities , where the motion of the particles is not uniform but occurs in correlated strings in certain regions , while other regions are less mobile @xcite .",

    "it was shown that at temperatures just above the melting transition , topological defects in the form of dislocations undergo correlated annihilation and creation , giving rise to a @xmath0 noise signal in the time dependent dislocation density @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 noise also coincides with the appearance of dynamical heterogeneities . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the dynamical heterogeneities disappear and the noise spectrum of the fluctuating topological defect density becomes white , indicating the loss of correlations .",

    "the particle motion in this annihilation process occurs in the form of string like jumps @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the dynamical heterogeneities are directly correlated with the motion , creation , and annihilation of topological defects .",
    "further evidence that in 2d the topological defects are associated with dynamical heterogeneities has also been reported in the recent experiments of dullens and kegel on 2d colloidal suspensions , where the non - sixfold - coordinated colloids were more mobile than sixfold - coordinated colloids @xcite .    in a related class of systems",
    ", glassiness does not arise solely from the particle interactions but instead occurs due to coupling with an underlying quenched substrate .",
    "it has already been shown in 2d systems of classical electrons in the presence of quenched disorder that the particle motion occurs in string - like dynamical structures where a chain of particles moves past other particles that are pinned @xcite .",

    "it is important to note , however , that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the disorder was simulated as a collection of randomly located pins , the quenched disorder had a tendency to create topological defects even at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , the connection between the dynamical heterogeneities and the topological defects was not immediately apparent , and it would be desirable to identify a system in which the amount of heterogeneous motion could be controlled systematically .    in this work , we propose a model of repulsively interacting particles on a substrate in which the disorder potential is perfectly commensurate with the triangular crystal and therefore does not favor the creation of topological defects .",
