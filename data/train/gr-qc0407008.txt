    "the commissioning of earth - based long - baseline gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometers has finally come to fruition a little less than three decades since the discovery of the hulse and taylor binary pulsar in 1974 @xcite and the subsequent confirmation of the emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) by that system.@xcite on the other hand , the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) is being designed as a space - based detector to observe low - frequency gws ( in the milli- to deci - hertz band ) to complement the high - frequency observations ( in the deca- to kilo - hertz band ) of its earth - based counterparts .",
    "many of the sources of low - frequency gws fall in the category of compact binary objects , which include white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes . during the early stages of the inspiral",
    ", these compact binaries will emit almost monochromatic low - frequency gravitational waves , which will produce detectable signals in the lisa data .",
    "lisa will comprise three spacecrafts located at the vertices of a nearly equilateral triangle ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ lisatri ] ) with the side lengths equal to 5 million kilometers.@xcite each craft will house a couple of laser - mounted optical benches and proof masses and will freely fall around the sun in an orbit that lies on a plane slightly tilted with respect to the ecliptic .",
    "the tilt will vary from one craft to the other . by inclining the plane of the triangle to the ecliptic by a constant angle of 60@xmath0",
    ", the side - length of the triangle can be maintained at a fixed value . in the process",
    ", the triangle will complete one spin about its normal while its centroid , trailing behind the earth by about 8.3 million kilometers , completes one orbit around the sun .",
    "the effect of a gw on lisa will be to change the physical distances between its freely falling proof masses .",
    "this change will be registered as fractional frequency shifts in the six laser beams exchanged among the three space - crafts .",
    "the shifts will have additional contributions from various noise sources .",
    "these include two primary ones , namely , the laser - frequency fluctuations ( contributing a fractional shift of about 10@xmath1 ) and the optical - bench motions ( with a fractional shift of about 10@xmath2 ) . in order to detect the gws ( with a strain around 10@xmath3 ) , it is imperative that these noises be mitigated by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a data analysis technique for achieving this goal was accomplished by armstrong , estabrook , and tinto.@xcite .",
    "they showed that by combining appropriately the time - delayed versions of these six data streams , with six additional ones arising from laser beam exchanges between adjacent optical benches on each craft , one can eliminate the two primary noises , thus , rendering the lisa data analyzable for gw signals .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate a strategy for detecting nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binary objects in the lisa data .",
    "there are two complementary aspects to such a strategy .",
    "the first is to deduce the maximum number of noise - independent detectors that lisa offers . and",
    "the second is to construct the appearance of a gw signal in them .",
    "this allows one to match the data from these detectors with a template of the expected signal in them . whether a match is strong enough to warrant a detection",
    "is then decided based on the rate of false alarms at the level of that match . for",
    "the problem of detecting low - mass compact binaries , involving white - dwarfs and neutron stars , the waveforms obtained by the quadrupole approximation @xcite suffice for accurately modeling the expected signal .",
    "this waveform allows for a slightly `` chirping '' source , i.e. , a source whose orbital frequency @xmath4 is increasing at a rate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the observation period .",
    "we will use this waveform as a template in our detection strategy .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pseudo ] , we enunciate the three noise - independent data combinations , or `` pseudo - detectors '' , that were first obtained in ref . @xcite by combining the frequency shifts of the twelve data streams exchanged among the lisa spacecrafts through time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) @xcite . in sec . [",
    "sec : gwstrain ] , we obtain the form of the gravitational - wave strain caused by a compact binary source in these three pseudo - detectors .",
    "this provides the templates required to search for signals from such sources in the lisa data .",
    "we then study the antenna patterns of these pseudo - detectors at different points in lisa s orbit , emphasizing how their relative sensitivities to a mildly chirping source vary as a function of sky position and source frequency .",
    "the study bears out the fact that noise - independence of detectors is a property distinct from their geometric independence .",
    "indeed , at gw wavelengths larger than about 0.1 au , which we will term as the long - wavelength limit , the strain of the third pseudo - detector tends to the difference of the strain of the first two .",
    "we then derive the optimal statistic for detecting gravitational waves from ( non - spinning ) compact binary inspirals by coherently combining the data of the three pseudo - detectors in sec . [",
    "sec : statistic ] .",
    "the statistic obtained here tracks the doppler modulation of the source frequency induced by the motion and time - varying orientation of lisa with respect to that source.@xcite for gaussian noise , we derive the probability distribution of our statistic , which can be used to compute the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a candidate event .",
    "we use this distribution to predict the behavior of false - alarm and detection rates as a function of the detection threshold set for the statistic . in sec .",
    "[ sec : templates ] , we construct the metric on the space of parameters that allows one to estimate the fractional loss of snr for a given mismatch between the template and the signal parameters . using this metric we esimate the number of templates that will be required to search the full astrophysically relevant volume of the parameter space while suffering a loss in snr of no more than 3% .",
    "we also estimate the computational speed required to implement such a search in real time .",
    "we briefly summarize the results obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , especially , stressing the applicability of our formalism to searches in the recently found second - generation tdi data combinations.@xcite note that in the expressions appearing in this paper , we set the gravitational coupling constant ( @xmath7 ) and the speed of light ( @xmath8 ) to unity .",
    "as illustrated in fig . [ lisatri ] , lisa consists of three spacecrafts , labeled @xmath91 , 2 , and 3 , located clockwise at the correspondingly labeled vertices of an almost equilateral triangle .",
    "let the arm - lengths of this triangle be @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 is the length of the arm facing the vertex @xmath14 . for specifying the orientation of each arm , we assign unit vectors @xmath15 along them , such that their directions are oriented anticlockwise about the triangle .",
    "each spacecraft will have two optical benches ( denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ lisatri ] ) equipped with independent lasers and photodetectors .",
    "thus , each spacecraft will shoot two beams towards the other two spacecrafts , respectively , resulting in six one - way beams along the 3 arms .",
    "the effect of an impinging gw is to cause a shift in the frequency of the laser beams . but",
    "a gw is not the only source causing such a shift .",
    "the laser - frequency fluctuation is another source . if @xmath17 is the central frequency of all the lasers in lisa , then the fractional shift caused by such fluctuations in the beam originating at optical bench @xmath14 is c_i ( t )  .",
    "similarly for the beam from the bench @xmath16 .",
    "what is measured , however , is the frequency fluctuation in the beam from one bench relative to that in the beam from a bench in one of the two other vertices .",
    "this way one obtains three `` clockwise '' oriented streams , @xmath18 , and three `` anticlockwise '' oriented streams , @xmath19 .",
    "the frequency fluctuation in the beam from bench @xmath20 relative to that in the beam originating at bench @xmath16 is termed @xmath18 . and @xmath21 can take only 1 , 2 , and 3 as values .",
    "these three numbers are ordered clockwise in fig .",
    "[ lisatri ] . by convention , whereas @xmath22 equals the number next to @xmath14 while going clockwise in that figure , @xmath23 equals the number preceding @xmath14 .",
    "e.g. , when @xmath24 , we take @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; when @xmath27 , we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 . ] therefore , @xmath30 is the data stream measured by beating the beam transmitted by bench 3 against that of bench @xmath31 , measured at time @xmath32 at bench 1 .",
    "the remaining two streams , namely , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can be obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices in the @xmath35 expression .",
    "( thus , @xmath36 , and so on . )",
    "three more data streams , termed @xmath19 , are obtained by measuring the frequency fluctuation in the beam from bench @xmath37 relative to that originating at bench @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , @xmath38 . once again",
    ", the remaining two @xmath19 streams can be obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices in the above expression for @xmath39 .",
    "( hence , @xmath40 , and so on . )",
    "the fractional shift @xmath41 is constructed from @xmath42 by shifting back the latter stream in time by an amount @xmath11 . for brevity of expressions , we introduce the time - shift operator @xmath43 by its action on a data stream @xmath44 as in : [ operator ] _",
    "i x(t)= x(t - l_i )  , where the label @xmath14 denotes the arm along which the time - shift is affected .",
    "one can thus define the 6 inter - craft streams as follows@xcite : [ datastreams ] u_1 & = & _ 2c_3 -c_1,u_2=_3c_1-c_2,u_3=_1c_2-c_3  , + v_1 & = & c_1 -_3c_2,v_2=c_2-_1c_3 , v_3=c_3-_2c_1 . note that the effect of such a shift on the fourier components , @xmath45 , of the data is to change them to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a frequency variable .",
    "therefore , the effect of the operator @xmath48 on a data stream is to change its fourier transform by the factor @xmath49 .",
    "these data streams , however , are expected to suffer from several noise sources , two of which , viz . ,",
    "the laser - frequency fluctuations and the optical - bench motions , tower over the others .",
    "the two other noise sources are the photon - shot noise and the fluctuations in the motion of the proof masses .",
    "the laser - frequency fluctuations directly influence the fractional frequency - shifts , @xmath50 , and , therefore , the data streams @xmath18 and @xmath51 .",
    "the effect of the optical bench motions on the @xmath50 is additive : let the random velocities of the optical benches be @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this causes a doppler shift in the frequency of the lasers mounted on those benches , which in turn modifies the @xmath50 to c_1 & & c_1 - _",
    "3_1  , + c_1^ * & & c_1^ * + _ 2_1^ * .",
    "the remaining @xmath50 and @xmath54 can be inferred by cyclically permuting the indices in the above expression",
    ". if @xmath55 are the random velocities of the proof masses on benches @xmath14 and @xmath16 , then it is easy to see that the value of @xmath35 and @xmath56 gets affected by additional terms @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively",
    ". finally , when there is a gw signal present , these streams will receive additional contribution owing to the fractional frequency shifts caused by it .",
    "thus , in the presence of the above noise sources and signal , the data streams get modified as [ intercraft ] u_1 & & u_1 = _ 2(c_3 - _ 2_3 ) -(c_1^ * + _ 2_1^ * ) + 2*n*_2 _ 1^ * + n^shot_u_1 + u_1^gw  , + v_1 & & v_1 = -_3(c_2^ * + _ 3_2^ * ) + ( c_1-_3_1 ) + 2*n*_3 _ 1 -n^shot_v_1 - v_1^gw  , where @xmath59 are the photon - shot noises and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the gw signals present in the @xmath18 and @xmath51 data streams , respectively .",
    "the four remaining @xmath18 and @xmath51 streams can be obtained from the above expressions by cyclic permutations of the indices . in the rest of the paper",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath51 will refer to these modified streams .",
    "when a ( gw ) signal is absent , they will still be given by these modified expression , but with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the form of @xmath64 and @xmath61 in the presence of a signal will be explored in the next section .",
    "in addition to the six inter - craft data streams discussed above there is supplementary information available about the noise sources in the intra - craft beams exchanged through the optical fibers connecting two adjacent optical benches @xmath14 and @xmath16 located in the @xmath14th craft . in all there are six intra - craft beams , two per bench pair .",
    "but the two intra - craft beams within a craft can be beaten against each other to produce a single stream that is directly relevant to noise suppression .",
    "to wit , at craft 1 , by beating the frequency of the beam from bench 1 relative to that on bench @xmath31 , one forms the stream , [ intracraft ] w_1 = ( c_1-_3_1 ) - ( c_1^*+_2_1^ * ) + _ 3_1 + _ 2_1^ * .",
    "two other intra - craft data combinations , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , can be obtained by the cyclic permutation of indices in the above expression .",
    "note that these intra - craft streams will bear negligible influence from any impinging gravitational wave .",
    "nevertheless , as we explain below , they offer information on laser - frequency fluctuations and optical - bench motions that can be used to render the @xmath18 and @xmath51 streams essentially free of any noise from these two sources . together with the @xmath18 and @xmath51 , the @xmath67 form a a total of nine data streams that a data analyst has recourse to in hunting for a gw signal in lisa .    following the work of tinto and armstrong @xcite , it was shown by dhurandhar et al .",
    "@xcite that by acting on the 6 inter - craft streams , @xmath18 , @xmath51 , and the 3 intra - craft streams , @xmath67 , with certain polynomials , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , of the time - shift operators , @xmath43 , one can form several combinations of time - delayed data streams , [ pseudogen ] x^a(t ) = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3  , that have the laser - frequency and the optical - bench motion noise eliminated . above",
    ", @xmath71 labels the different combinations so obtained .",
    "the above technique of constructing such data combinations of pseudo - detectors is called time - delay interferometry .",
    "the pseudo - detectors can be recast as x^a = trace  , where thus , for a given choice of the data streams @xmath18 , @xmath51 , @xmath67 ( and , therefore , the matrix @xmath72 ) , the matrix @xmath73 of the time - shift polynomials forms a representation of the pseudo - detectors @xmath74 .    of the several possible pseudo - detectors , only 3 are linearly independent and",
    "have a non - vanishing gw strain in them , in general @xcite .",
    "the three that will be discussed here are defined by their corresponding @xmath73 : and in the above expressions , it is assumed that all arm lengths are almost identical .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to note that these data combinations diagonalize their noise covariance matrix @xcite and , therefore , are also noise - independent .",
    "although the laser - frequency noise is eliminated in the @xmath76 , there is still present the noise associated with the acceleration of the proof masses onboard each craft and the photon - shot noise .",
    "in general , x^a(t ) = n^a(t ) + h^a(t )  , where [ straintime ] h^a(t ) = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3  , is the gravitational - wave strain in pseudo - detector @xmath71 and @xmath77 is the time - delayed sum of the remaining noise components .",
    "one typically assumes that these components and , hence , the total noise , has a gaussian probability distribution with a zero mean .",
    "their variance - covariance matrix elements are given as follows .",
    "for the photon - shot noise , these elements are [ shotpsd ] & = & + & = & = p^shot(f)(f - f)_ij , + & = & = = 0  , for any @xmath14 and @xmath78 . above",
    ", @xmath79 is termed as the one - sided power - spectral density ( psd ) of the photon - shot noise .",
    "furthermore , one assumes the proof - mass noise to be isotropic , such that : [ proofpsd ] & = & = p^proof(f - f)_jl , + & = & = 0  , for any @xmath14 , @xmath78 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "also , the covariance of the shot noise in any data stream with the noise in the motion of any proof - mass is zero .",
    "it is estimated that @xmath82 ^ 2 { \\rm hz}^{-1}$ ] and that the proof - mass noise psd is @xmath83^{-2 } { \\rm hz}^{-1}$].@xcite while the proof - mass noise enters the very low frequency band of lisa , the shot noise enters the higher end of lisa s sensitivity band .",
    "it is now possible to deduce the noise psd , @xmath84 , of each of the pseudo - detectors from the above expressions .",
    "it follows from them that in the absence of a signal , each pseudo - detector is pure noise , @xmath85 , with a zero mean gaussian probability distribution .",
    "the variance of this distribution is = p^(a)(f)(f - f)^ab . by substituting for @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ pseudogen ] ) ( with @xmath86 and @xmath87 set to zero there ) in the above equation and using the covariances of the noise components defined in eqs ( [ shotpsd ] ) and ( [ proofpsd ] ) one finds @xcite : [ generalnoise ] p^(a)(f ) & = & _ i=1 ^ 3 the resulting noise spectra for each pseudo - detector is @xcite : [ noise ] p^(1)(f ) & = & p^(2)(f ) = 8 ^ 2 ( f l)\\{p^shot + & & + [ 6 + 4(2f l ) + 2(4f l)]p^proof }  , + p^(3)(f ) & = & .",
    "therefore , the data analysis challenge is to detect signals in this remaining noise .",
    "since lisa will be orbiting the solar - system barycenter ( ssb ) , it is convenient to introduce a reference frame centered at the ssb . as shown in fig .",
    "[ barycenter ] , we define the @xmath88 and @xmath89 axes of this ssb frame to lie on the ecliptic , and the @xmath90 axis to be normal to it and pointing towards the north ecliptic pole . the @xmath88 axis points towards the vernal equinox .",
    "we take the gw source to be located in the direction given by the vector @xmath91 .",
    "a gravitational wave from this source will arrive at the ssb origin traveling along @xmath92 .",
    "the sky position @xmath93 defines the cartesian components of the propagation direction , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the sky - position angles are equivalently characterized by two of the three components of @xmath91 , say , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "i = 2 ( _ i ) ( _ i ) are the beam - pattern functions of the @xmath14th arm for the two polarizations .",
    "an impinging gw causes a change in the light - travel time along an arm that can be calculated by solving the null geodesic equation in the corresponding perturbed spacetime .",
    "this in turn causes a time - varying doppler shift , which clearly depends on the difference between the gw strains at the two space - crafts at the end of the arm .",
    "one also expects this shift to be dependent on the position of the source relative to the arm , @xmath104 .",

    "the extension to slightly chirping sources is straightforward and will be presented subsequently .",
    "if the laser - frequency and optical - bench motion noises were at the level of the other noises , one could hunt for gw signals in the @xmath18 and @xmath51 data streams .",
