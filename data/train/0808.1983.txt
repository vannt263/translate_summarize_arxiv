    "if this effect is induced by electro - magnetic radiation it is usually referred to as photogalvanic ( or photovoltaic ) effect , particularly if breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry is related to the microscopic structure of the system  @xcite .",
    "blanter and bttiker  @xcite have shown that one of the possible realizations of the seebeck ratchet can be a superlattice irradiated by light through a mask of the same period but phase shifted with respect to the superlattice . in the present work we have experimentally realized this idea with some modifications .",
    "the photocurrent has been observed in semiconductor heterostructures with a one - dimensional lateral periodic potential induced by etching a noncentrosymmetric grating into the sample cap layer .",
    "the in - plane modulation of the pump radiation appears hence not via a mask with periodic structures but due to the near - field effects of radiation propagating through the grating .",
    "this photothermal ratchet effect was predicted by bttiker  @xcite and is polarization independent under normal light incidence .",
    "in addition we have observed photocurrents sensitive to the plane of polarization of the linearly polarized terahertz ( thz ) radiation and to the helicity in case of circularly polarized photoexcitation .",
    "the theoretical analysis enables us to propose new mechanisms of the observed circular and linear photogalvanic effects which are related to the combined action of out - of - phase periodic potential and in - plane modulated pumping of the two - dimensional electron system .",

    "the lateral grating etched into the sample s surface induces a periodical lateral potential acting on the two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "in addition , it modifies the normally - incident radiation causing its spatial modulation in plane of the electron gas . if the lateral structuring is asymmetrical the spatial modulations of the static lateral potential @xmath90 and the radiation intensity @xmath203 are relatively shifted relatively to each other . as a result the product of the static force @xmath204 and the photothermal modulation of the electron density @xmath205",
    "has a nonzero space average and , therefore , a homogeneous electric current is generated , an effect previously predicted by blanter and bttiker  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have proposed polarization - dependent photocurrents arising in the same system with broken symmetry due to the phase shift between periodic potential and periodic light field .",
    "these currents , in contrast to the polarization - independent photocurrent , are independent of the energy relaxation time , if @xmath206 , and controlled only by momentum relaxation time .",
