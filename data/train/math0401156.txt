    "in this paper , we survey some aspects of the theory of complex ( fractal ) dimensions of fractal strings , as developed by the authors in the recent research monograph _ fractal geometry and number theory _  @xcite and pursued in the later papers  [ [cxdssc ] ] .",
    "this theory builds upon earlier work of the first author and his collaborators , including carl pomerance , helmut maier and christina he [ [ml93c],[ml95c],[mlcp96c ] , , ] . in the present paper ,",
    "we stress the important case of self - similar strings ( which are one - dimensional self - similar geometries ) along with the geometric and dynamical motivations and applications . for the spectral theory , in particular for a discussion of the question (  la mark kac  @xcite ) _ can one hear the shape of a fractal drum ? , _ going back to the weyl  berry conjecture  ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to the above works and the relevant references therein , including  [ , , [ ml97c ] ] ; see also  @xcite .    for pedagogical reasons , our goal in   [ s : fs][s : dyn ] is to illustrate the mathematical theory of complex dimensions of self - similar strings by means of a few representative examples and results , along with a discussion of some extensions and open problems .",
    "we do not aim for the greatest generality or the most complete statements .",
    "the interested reader may wish to consult  [ [cxdssc ] ] ( and the relevant references therein ) for more details and generality . in   [ s : shifts ] and   [ s : coho ] , as well as in   [ s : ss finite ] below , we explore and clarify the emerging analogies between self - similar strings ( and self - similar geometries ) on the one hand , and varieties over finite fields and arithmetic geometries on the other hand .",
    "we give an overview of the contents of this article . in   [ s : fs ] , we define the notion of fractal string , and introduce the geometric zeta function and ( fractal ) complex dimensions of a fractal string . in   [ s : ss ] , we focus on self - similar fractal strings . the geometric zeta function of a fractal string @xmath0 with lengths @xmath1 is defined in equation  ( [ e : zetal ] ) .",
    "the poles of this function are called the _ complex dimensions _ of @xmath0 . for a string that is self - similar under @xmath2 scalings by factors @xmath3 ( without gaps , see   [ s : ss ] ) , the complex dimensions are the solutions to the equation @xmath4 ( see  ( [ e : zeta ss ] ) and  ( [ e : eq ] ) below ) . if @xmath5 for some positive number  @xmath6 and certain positive integers  @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , this reduces to a polynomial equation , and it is a transcendental equation when such integers do not exist .",
    "we introduce the dichotomy of lattice vs.  nonlattice self - similar strings in   [ s : l nl ] to make this distinction .",
    "this distinction is much like that between rational and irrational real numbers .",
    "the complex dimensions of a lattice string lie periodically on finitely many vertical lines @xmath9 constant , separated by a fixed distance @xmath10 , the _ oscillatory period _ of the lattice string ( see  [ s : l nl ] ) .",
    "therefore , we view a lattice string as an analogue of a variety over a finite field , as explained below .",
    "the space of lattice strings is dense in the space of all self - similar strings , and nonlattice strings are shown to have properties that compel us to regard them as analogues of ` infinite dimensional varieties ' .",
    "moreover , nonlattice strings with a very large number of scaling ratios form the bridge between self - similar and arithmetic geometries . some evidence ( partly conjectural ) for this",
    "is presented in   [ s : dfree ] . in that section ,",
    "we apply techniques from diophantine approximation to obtain ` dimension - free ' regions for nonlattice strings .",
    "the size of these dimension - free regions depends on how well the ratios @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) can be approximated by rational numbers . in our theory , we deduce from the results in  [ s : dfree ] combined with our ` explicit formulas ' from  @xcite suitable asymptotic expansions with good error term for various geometric (  [ s : l nl ] ) or dynamical (  [ s : dyn ] ) quantities associated with self - similar fractal strings : the larger the dimension - free region , the better the error term .",
    "in   [ s : dyn ] , we explain how the logarithmic derivative of the geometric zeta function of a fractal string can be obtained as the generating function of the periodic orbits of a continuous - time self - similar dynamical system .",
    "we thus find an euler - type product for the geometric zeta function .",
    "this is analogous to the discrete - time dynamical system on a variety over a finite field , namely , the frobenius flow , as explained below .",
    "conjecturally  [ , ] , the corresponding arithmetic dynamical system is the shift on the real line ( with infinitesimal generator the derivative ) . in   [ s : shifts ] , we propose an analysis of self - similar strings by measuring the overlap under shifts .",
    "finally , in   [ s : coho ] we present three tables , summarizing three aspects of these analogies .    as was alluded to above , whereas the work described in   [ s : fs][s : dyn ] is completely rigorous and is part of a well - developed ( and still growing ) mathematical theory of complex dimensions of fractal strings , the content of   [ s : shifts][s : coho ] is of a more speculative nature and should , in the long - term , be the object of further investigations and developments .",
    "it builds upon well - known analogies in arithmetic ( or diophantine ) geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and upon new ones proposed in   and in the first author s forthcoming book  @xcite , _ in search of the riemann zeros_.      we close this introduction by providing some motivations and background material on varieties over a finite field .",
    "we want to reassure the reader mainly interested in fractal geometry that no prior knowledge of arithmetic or algebraic geometry is required to read this paper .",
    "the analogy between the geometric zeta function of self - similar fractal strings and the zeta function of a variety over a finite field becomes apparent in the following simplest example .",
    "the zeta function of the affine line is a prime number and @xmath13 denotes the finite field with @xmath14 elements . ] over @xmath13 is defined as  @xmath15 .",
    "we compare this with the geometric zeta function of the cantor string , to be introduced in example  [ e : mcs ] , @xmath16 writing @xmath17 for the minkowski dimension of the cantor string , as will be explained in   [ s : fs ] , we find @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "these zeta functions have one line of poles , at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 or @xmath23 , respectively ) .    in general",
    ", one defines the zeta function of a variety over a finite field as the generating function ( or mellin transform ) of the counting measure of the positive divisors on the variety . as such",
    ", it is immediately clear that the zeta function can be obtained as an euler product of factors that are defined in terms of the prime divisors of the variety .",
    "a variety over a finite field comes equipped with an action of the frobenius endomorphism . of @xmath13 . ]",
    "this defines a discrete - time flow on the variety , the orbits of which are conjugacy classes of points on the variety , which ( for curves ) are the prime divisors of the variety .",
    "the logarithmic derivative of the euler product is the generating function of the counting measure of the orbits of frobenius .",
    "one of the most important developments in the theory of algebraic varieties was the definition and subsequent development of a cohomology theory . indeed",
    ", the so - called tale cohomology , which captures the combinatorics of families of tale covers of the variety , provides a theory that can be compared to the classical singular homology and cohomology theories of manifolds .",
    "since the tale theory is defined purely algebraically , it allows application to varieties defined over a finite field . in particular",
    ", one recovers the zeta function of the variety as the alternating product of the characteristic polynomials of the induced action of frobenius on the tale cohomology groups .",
    "the poles of this zeta function are located on ` integer vertical lines ' @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the dimension of the variety , and the zeros are located on ` half - integer vertical lines ' @xmath26 .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  [ , , , [aw48c],[aw80c],,i ] for further information about this beautiful subject . )",
    "this theory was first modelled on the theory of the riemann zeta function , which is the first example of the zeta function of an ` arithmetic geometry ' , namely , the spectrum of @xmath27 .",
    "there exist only one - dimensional with itself has coordinate ring @xmath28 , hence the product reduces to the diagonal  @xcite . ]",
    "arithmetic geometries .",
    "the ( completed ) riemann zeta function has simple poles at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , hence one could say ( by analogy with the case of a curve over a finite field ) that the cohomology groups @xmath31 and @xmath32 are one - dimensional ; i.e. , the spectrum of  @xmath27 ( completed at the archimedean place ) is connected and one - dimensional . on the other hand ,",
    "if the riemann hypothesis holds , then the middle cohomology group @xmath33 could possibly be defined , and should be infinite dimensional . moreover , the logarithmic derivative of the riemann zeta function is the generating function of the prime - power counting function .",
    "it is not known how the prime numbers @xmath14 can be viewed as the ( primitive ) periodic orbits ( of length  @xmath34 ) of a flow , but there is some indication that such a flow , if it exists , should take into account the smooth ( archimedean ) structure  @xcite .",
    "the simplest such flow is the shift on the real line .    in a book in preparation ( [ ] , announced in  @xcite ) , the first author has proposed a suitable notion of ` quantized fractal string ' , coined ` fractal membrane ' , and has significantly extended the above analogy between self - similar geometries and arithmetic geometries . in particular , lattice strings ( or membranes ) correspond to varieties over finite fields whereas nonlattice strings ( or membranes ) are viewed as a counterpart of number fields .. ] moreover , the scaling ratios of self - similar geometries ( or of ` self - similar membranes '  @xcite ) play the role of the ` generalized primes ' attached to fractal membranes , while expressions like  ( [ e : zeta ss ] ) for the geometric zeta function of a self - similar string ( with possibly infinitely many scaling ratios and gaps ) correspond to the euler product representation ( of the same nature as that for the classical riemann zeta function  @xcite ) of the partition function of a fractal membrane ( as obtained in  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in joint work of the first author with ryszard nest  @xcite , it was recently shown that the fractal membranes ( resp .",
    "self - similar membranes ) introduced in  @xcite can be rigorously constructed as the second quantization of fractal strings by using fermi ",
    "dirac ( resp . ,",
    "gibbs  boltzmann or ` free ' ) statistics along with aspects of the theory of operator algebras and of connes noncommutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "a _ fractal string _ is a one - dimensional drum with fractal boundary .",
    "thus , a fractal string is a bounded open subset @xmath0 of the real line .",
    "we assume here that the connected components ` touch ' each other ; i.e. , the closure of @xmath0 is a bounded connected interval @xmath35 , and the boundary @xmath36 of @xmath0 is a disconnected fractal subset of  @xmath37 with measure zero .",
    "the lengths of the connected components ( i.e. , open intervals ) of the string are called the _ lengths _ of @xmath0 ( a better terminology would be to speak of the _ strings _ of a _ fractal harp ; _ see  [ , p.8 ] ) .",
    "we can list the lengths of a fractal string in nonincreasing order @xmath38 each repeated according to its multiplicity .",
    "the _ geometric zeta function _ of the fractal string is determined by the sequence @xmath39 @xmath40 thus , for example , @xmath41 is the length of the closure of the fractal string in the real line . on the other hand , @xmath42 is the number of lengths of @xmath0 , and we exclude the case when this number is finite . recall that the abscissa of convergence of a dirichlet series is defined as the smallest real number @xmath43 such that the series  ( [ e : zetal ] ) converges ( absolutely ) in the half - plane @xmath44 .",
    "thus the abscissa of convergence of @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "we now compute the minkowski ( or box ) dimension of the complement of the string in its interval .",
    "( see also  [ [ml92c ] , ] . ) when the two endpoints of an interval of length @xmath47 are covered by intervals ( or disks ) of radius @xmath48 , then these disks overlap if @xmath49 , covering a length @xmath47 , or they do not overlap if @xmath50 , in which case they cover a length of @xmath51 . moreover , there are the two pieces of length  @xmath48 sticking out to the left and the right of @xmath35 .",
    "thus the length @xmath52 of the ( two - sided ) @xmath48-neighborhood of the string is given by , @xmath53 denotes the set @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is the open @xmath48-neighborhood of @xmath56 .",
    "also , @xmath57 denotes lebesgue measure in @xmath37.[f : set sum ] ] @xmath58    [ r : two - sided ] in  [ [cxdssc ] ] , we used the inner neighborhood of the string , to allow for strings with lengths not necessarily embedded in the real line .",
    "the present approach is less intrinsic , but more suitable to study properties of self - similarity ( also see the end of   [ s : cxd ] ) .",
    "the _ minkowski dimension @xmath59 _ of @xmath36 is the infimum of the numbers @xmath60 such that  @xmath61 as @xmath62 : @xmath63 .",
    "further ,  @xmath36 is _ minkowski measurable _ if the following limit exists in @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( see remark  [ r : ss boundary ] below and , e.g. , [ [ml93c],[mlcp96c],,ch.3,,ch.5 ] . )    we now show that the minkowski dimension can be recovered as the abscissa of convergence of @xmath45 .",
    "( this was first observed by the first author in  [ [ml93c ] ] using a result of besicovich and taylor  @xcite ; see also  [ , ] . )",
    "the abscissa of convergence @xmath43 of the geometric zeta function  @xmath45 coincides with @xmath59 , the minkowski dimension of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath67 such that @xmath68 . for @xmath69",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 it follows that @xmath71 for some constant @xmath72 .",
    "hence the series  ( [ e : zetal ] ) converges for @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 .",
    "since this holds for every  @xmath75 , we obtain  .",
    "if @xmath76 , we conclude that @xmath77 , since @xmath78 is bounded .",
    "otherwise , let @xmath79 .",
    "then the series  ( [ e : zetal ] ) converges .",
    "since the sequence of lengths is nonincreasing , we find that @xmath80 hence  @xmath81 . given  , it follows that @xmath82 for  @xmath83 . for @xmath84",
    ", we estimate the @xmath85-th term ( in the first or the second sum ) in  ( [ e : ve ] ) by @xmath51 , and for  , we estimate this term in the second sum by @xmath86 .",
    "thus we find @xmath87 , so that  @xmath88 .",
    "since this holds for every real number  @xmath89 , we conclude that  @xmath90 .",
    "hence these two quantities coincide .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 has a meromorphic continuation to a neighborhood of the half - plane @xmath91 .",
    "clearly then , @xmath59 is a pole of @xmath45 .",
    "the geometric zeta function may have other singularities , which are then located on or to the left of the line @xmath92 .",
    "these singularities are necessarily poles , and they are called the _ complex dimensions _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath93 the set of ( visible ) complex dimensions of @xmath0 ( within the given region ) . clearly , it is a discrete subset of @xmath94 , and therefore is at most countable .",
    "the complex dimensions enter into the explicit formulas for the various geometric , dynamical , and spectral quantities related to @xmath0 .",
    "these ( pointwise or distributional ) explicit formulas  in the sense of number theory  @xcite , but more general  are established in  [ , ch.4 ] and then applied and adapted to a number of situations throughout the rest of that book , especially in  [ , chs.57,9 ] ( see also  [ [cxdssc ] ] , along with the forthcoming second edition of  @xcite ) .    as an illustration",
    ", we have the explicit formula for the volume ( i.e. , length ) of the tubular neighborhood  @xmath95 , which we formulate here in the case when the complex dimensions are simple .",
    "see  [ , ch.6 ] for the general formulation and additional details .",
    "let @xmath96 have a meromorphic continuation to a neighborhood of @xmath97 ( for some @xmath98 ) , with simple poles and such that @xmath30 is not a pole of @xmath45 .",
    "then , under mild growth conditions on @xmath99 @xmath100 the sum extends over all poles of @xmath45 in @xmath101 ( i.e. , over all ` visible ' complex dimensions @xmath102 of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this formula expresses @xmath95 as a sum of oscillatory terms of the form @xmath103 , where  @xmath102 runs over all ( visible ) complex dimensions of @xmath0 .",
    "these terms grow asymptotically as @xmath104 in size , and have a multiplicative period @xmath105 ; i.e. ,  @xmath106 and  @xmath107 have the same argument .",
    "the coefficient of each oscillatory term depends in particular on @xmath108 , the residue of the geometric zeta function at  @xmath102 . by analogy with weyl s formula for the volume of the @xmath48-neighborhoods of a ( smooth ) submanifold of euclidean space ( [ , , ",
    "6.66.9,esp.thm.6.9.9 ] ) , we expect eventually to be able to obtain a suitable geometric interpretation of these values ; see  [ ,  6.1.1 ] .",
    "for example , in view of  ( [ e : m ] ) , the residue at  @xmath59 is closely related to the minkowski content ( see  [ , thm.6.12 ] ) : @xmath109 provided that there are no other complex dimensions with real part @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , this is an important reason why we prefer to work here with two - sided ( rather than with one - sided ) neighborhoods of @xmath0 ( see remark  [ r : two - sided ] above ) . indeed , in the former case",

    "this is the analogue of the famous prime number theorem , which can be stated as @xmath358 . in the nonlattice case , using the dimension - free region  ( [ e : dimfree ] ) and the techniques explained in  @xcite , we even obtain for every ( small )  @xmath359 the following _ prime orbit theorem with error term _ : @xmath360 this estimate is best possible if the system @xmath361 is badly approximable ( as explained for @xmath251 in   [ s : dfree ] ) .",
    "we note that in  @xcite , we also obtain more precise explicit formulas for the counting function @xmath362 .",
    "in the simplest case of the cantor string , discussed in the introduction and in example  [ e : mcs ] , it is easy to see that a shifted copy , @xmath363 , overlaps the cantor string only for shifts over  @xmath364 , @xmath365 , or suitable combinations of such shifts : @xmath366 , @xmath367 . for all other values of the real number @xmath176",
    ", there is no overlap : @xmath368 .",
    "moreover , the minkowski dimension ( or hausdorff dimension ) of the intersection is always @xmath149 and its minkowski content ( or hausdorff measure ) is @xmath369 times smaller than that of the cantor set itself , where @xmath313 is the number of nonzero digits of @xmath176 in the above representation .",
    "this information suffices to reconstruct the cantor set and its complex dimensions .    in general , let @xmath370 be a self - similar fractal subset of the real line ( see remark  [ r : ss boundary ] ) .",
    "let @xmath371 denote the interval @xmath372 . to measure the overlap of @xmath370 with a shifted copy of it , we consider the function for the notation @xmath373 . ]",
    "@xmath374 , for @xmath375 .",
    "we then construct the ` dimension - like function ' @xmath376 and the ` upper minkowski content - like function ' @xmath377 we expect that these functions exhibit the following behavior . in the lattice case ,",
    "@xmath378 for a bounded discrete set of values .",
    "the function @xmath379 is discontinuous at each of these values , and continuous and vanishing on the complement . in the nonlattice case ,",
    "@xmath378 for every @xmath176 in a countable dense subset of a compact connected interval and @xmath379 is continuous .",
    "the complex dimensions of @xmath370 can be recovered from the functions @xmath380 and @xmath379 .",
    "we hope to develop these ideas in subsequent work .",
    "we have suggested in  [ ,  10.5 ] that there should exist a notion of ` complex cohomology ' that could be associated to both arithmetic and self - similar geometries and have proposed a possible dictionary towards it , building in part upon the analogy between lattice strings ( or more generally , lattice self - similar geometries ) and curves ( or varieties ) over finite fields  [ [aw52c],,i ] .",
    "we have proposed , in particular , to construct a ` cohomology theory ' , which to each ( dynamical ) complex dimension @xmath102 of such a geometry , would associate a nontrivial cohomology group  @xmath381 ( with coefficients in the field of complex numbers ) . in general ,",
    "@xmath381 would be expected to be an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this should be the case , for example , for the cohomology spaces associated with a nonlattice string ( or more generally , with a nonlattice self - similar geometry ) .",
    "a possible way of developing such a theory was proposed at the very end of  [ ,  10.5 ] .",
    "it relies on a suitable equivalence relation between the dirichlet series ( or ` zeta functions ' ) attached to these geometries ; see  [ , p.220 ] .",
    "the geometric zeta function of a fractal string can have complex dimensions of higher multiplicity , like in example  [ e : not simple ] above .",
    "hence @xmath96 should be compared to the zeta function of a variety over a finite field , and not for example to its logarithmic derivative .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the residue at a complex dimension is quite arbitrary , and not an integer in general .",
    "another confirmation is that the logarithmic derivative of the geometric zeta function is the logarithmic derivative of the dynamical zeta function ( as shown in  @xcite and recalled in   [ s : dyn ] above ) , which is the generating function of the counting function of the periodic orbits of a dynamical system .",
    "this corresponds to the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function of a variety , which is the generating function of the counting function of the periodic orbits of the frobenius automorphism , as explained in ",
    "[ s : ss finite ] . on the other hand , for the simplest self - similar strings ( i.e. , those without gaps  @xcite ) ,",
    "the geometric zeta function has only poles and no zeros .",
    "this would mean that there is only ` even dimensional cohomology ' in that case , but the correct interpretation is as yet unclear .",
    "[ r : nl gaps ] one aspect of table  [ t : coho ] that we have not developed in this paper is that the dichotomy lattice vs.  nonlattice also exists for the sequence of gaps .",
    "a string may be a lattice string both for the scaling ratios and the gaps ( and hence , both the zeros and poles of @xmath45 are found by solving a polynomial equation , by equation  ( [ e : zeta ss ] ) ) , but be nonlattice when the scaling ratios and gaps are considered together ; that is , the numerator and denominator of @xmath45 have uncommensurable oscillatory periods .                    c.  deninger , _ evidence for a cohomological approach to analytic number theory _ , in : proc .",
