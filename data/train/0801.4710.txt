    "photo - detection theory in continuous time has been widely developed @xcite and applied , in particular , to the fluorescence light emitted by a two - level atom stimulated by a coherent monochromatic laser @xcite . as well as",
    "various feedback schemes on the atom evolution , based on the outcoming photocurrent , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however the introduction and the analysis of feedback have always been focused on the control of the atom dynamics .",
    "the typical aim was to drive the atom to a preassigned asymptotic state or to a preassigned asymptotic unitary dynamics @xcite .    here ,",
    "on the contrary , we are interested in the emitted light and in employing control and feedback processes to enhance its squeezing properties .",
    "these can be checked by homodyne detection and spectral analysis of the output current . for these reasons",
    "we consider the mathematical description of photo - detection based on classical stochastic differential equations ( quantum trajectories ) , as it is suitable both to consistently compute the homodyne spectrum of fluorescence light , and to introduce feedback and control in the mathematical formulation .",
    "we study how the squeezing depends on the various control parameters and how feedback mechanisms can be successfully introduced .",
    "we consider only markovian feedback schemes  la wiseman - milburn @xcite , as they leave the homodyne spectrum explicitly computable .",

    "let us remark that , even if the feedback is based on the singular stochastic process @xmath34 , the mathematical formulation of the model is not affected by this singularity , as we do not observe directly the light in the forward channel .",

    "of course , if @xmath63 , then there is no feedback action on the atom , so that its a priori dynamics is independent of the measurement process , that is of the fractions @xmath25 , @xmath26 and of the phases @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath38 . on the contrary , if @xmath64 , then the a priori dynamics is modified by the feedback loop and it depends also on @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 and @xmath38 .",
    "we are interested in the light emitted by the atom and in particular in the squeezing properties of the light in the side channels 1 and 2 . with the help of the incoherent spectrum of the homodyne photocurrents",
    "we can analyze the squeezing properties of the light detected in the two side channels , and thus we can investigate the effect of the control parameters .",
    "when @xmath65 , the fluorescence light which is not lost in the forward channel is gathered in a unique side channel , so that the squeezing is analyzed just for that light which is also detected for the feedback loop .",
    "this means that the eventually squeezed light would not be available for other purposes .",
    "thus in this case a unique homodyne detector is employed and @xmath25 is its efficiency .",
    "the meaning and the possible usefulness of the squeezing of the light involved in the feedback loop is discussed by wiseman @xcite . when @xmath66 , the fluorescence light which is not lost in the forward channel is split in the two side channels .",
    "the homodyne detection of the light in channel 1 allows both the analysis of its squeezing and the feedback control .",
    "the light in channel 2 is detected for squeezing analysis , as well as it could be employed for different uses .",
    "let us remark that , even if we were interested in squeezing only for channel 2 , the choice of a feedback scheme based on homodyne detection in channel 1 would be still essential in order to get a time - homogeneous atomic evolution in the rotating frame .",
    "the structure of @xmath67 guarantees that , for every initial preparation of the atom , the a priori state @xmath40 asymptotically reaches the stationary state @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath70 matrix giving @xmath67 in the bloch sphere language , @xmath71 thus we can introduce the homodyne incoherent spectrum of the light revealed in each side channel @xmath72 as the limit of the normalized variance of the fourier transform of the photocurrent @xmath73 @xmath74 - { \\left\\vert{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}}\\left[\\int_0^t{\\mathrm{e}}^{{{\\mathrm{i}}}\\mu s}\\,i_k(s)\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}}s\\right]\\right\\vert}^2\\right\\}.\\ ] ] it is a positive even function of its real argument @xmath75 which can be computed from equations and by ito calculus and by the full theory of quantum continual measurement , which can provide the first and second moments of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "thus , for every initial state of the atom , we can obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the vectors in @xmath79 defined as @xmath80\\,\\rho_\\textrm{eq } + { { \\mathrm{i}}}\\frac{c}{|\\alpha_1|}\\,[\\rho_\\textrm{eq},\\sigma_\\varphi]\\big)\\,\\vec\\sigma\\big],\\\\ \\vec{t}_2={\\operatorname{tr}}\\big[\\big({\\mathrm{e}}^{{{\\mathrm{i}}}\\vartheta_2}\\sigma_-\\,\\rho_\\textrm{eq } + \\rho_\\textrm{eq}\\,{\\mathrm{e}}^{-{{\\mathrm{i}}}\\vartheta_2}\\sigma_+ - { \\operatorname{tr}}[\\sigma_{\\vartheta_2}\\,\\rho_\\textrm{eq}]\\,\\rho_\\textrm{eq}\\big)\\,\\vec\\sigma\\big],\\\\ \\vec{s}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\vartheta_k\\\\\\sin\\vartheta_k\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] more explicitly , by using the bloch components of the equilibrium state , we get @xmath81 @xmath82 each spectrum @xmath83 depends on @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath86 , @xmath33 , @xmath62 and @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 depends also on @xmath58 and @xmath60 .      independently of the presence of the feedback loop , every time a parameter @xmath86 vanishes",
    ", the corresponding photocurrent @xmath73 reduces to a pure white noise ( shot noise due to the local oscillator ) with spectrum @xmath89 for every choice of the other parameters .    analyze first @xmath63 , the situation without feedback . in this case",
    "each dependence on @xmath38 disappears and @xmath87 becomes independent of @xmath58 and @xmath60 , so that there is no difference between @xmath90 and @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the dependence of each spectrum @xmath83 on the corresponding @xmath86 reduces to the explicit multiplication coefficient in .",
    "therefore , when the control parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 give squeezed light in channel @xmath72 , the lowering of @xmath83 under the shot noise level is anyhow directly proportional to the fraction of emitted light gathered in that channel .      for @xmath91 and @xmath93 there is no dependence on @xmath33 and @xmath94 . in this case",
    "there is only thermal light with carrier frequency @xmath95 , while the local oscillator is at frequency @xmath37 .",
    "the result are two temperature dependent lorentzian peaks at @xmath96 .",
    "the white noise contribution is always present .",
    "when @xmath97 , @xmath83 becomes @xmath33-dependent and it can go below the shot noise level .",
    "this fact means that some negative correlation between signal and noise has been developed .",
    "some examples are plotted for both channels , always for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath92 and @xmath100 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show @xmath90 and @xmath87 respectively for @xmath101 ( line 1 ) and for @xmath102 ( line 3 ) , every time for values of @xmath56 and @xmath33 chosen in order to have a region with a pronounced squeezing ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 for line 1 ; @xmath105 , @xmath106 for line 3 ) .",
    "allow now @xmath108 .",
    "the optimal squeezing in channel 1 is always found for @xmath109 and the feedback loop is very helpful , giving good visible minima of @xmath90 also when @xmath25 is not close to 1 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath110 , fig .",
    "1 shows @xmath90 for @xmath101 ( line 2 ) and for @xmath102 ( line 4 ) , every time for values of @xmath56 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 and @xmath38 chosen in order to enhance the squeezing ( @xmath91 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 for line 2 ; @xmath91 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 for line 4 ) . again",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath116 .",
    "the utility of the feedback scheme can be appreciated by comparing lines 1 and 3 with lines 2 and 4 respectively .",
    "if we are interested in the light emitted in channel 2 and if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are assigned by some constraints , then the squeezing in channel 2 can be enhanced by a feedback scheme based on the photocurrent coming from channel 1 , but the feedback performance is not as good as it can be for the squeezing in channel 1 itself . fig .",
    "2 shows @xmath87 for @xmath101 ( line 2 ) and for @xmath102 ( line 4 ) , every time for values of @xmath56 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 , @xmath38 and @xmath61 , chosen in order to enhance the squeezing ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 for line 2 ; @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 for line 4 ) .    anyway , if the only constraint is @xmath127 and we are free in the choice of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the best observable squeezing in channel 2 is obtained in the limit case @xmath128 , @xmath63 .",
    "that is , when the whole non - lost light is gathered just in channel 2 and the white noise @xmath34 revealed in channel 1 is ignored .",
    "let us remark that , when we use control parameters enhancing the squeezing for channel @xmath72 , every time @xmath101 we find the spectrum @xmath83 with an absolute minimum in @xmath129 , while whenever @xmath130 we find the spectrum @xmath83 with two absolute minima , symmetric with respect to @xmath129 , which turns out to be a local maximum .",
    "finally let us remark that the idea of the papers @xcite was to choose the control parameters in such a way that , in the rotating frame , the atom is frozen in a preassigned pure state @xmath131 , i.e.  in such a way that , in the rotating frame , both the a priori state @xmath40 and the a posteriori state @xmath41 asymptotically reach @xmath132 .",
    "this is possible in an exact way only in a very ideal case , which in our notations corresponds to @xmath101 , @xmath120 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath99 , @xmath92 , which implies in particular @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "then , the a posteriori state @xmath41 is driven to a pure given state if @xmath56 and @xmath62 are such that @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "but this implies @xmath140 and the two incoherent spectra reduce to pure shot noise .",
    "this is reasonable : if the atom if frozen there is not incoherent scattering of light .",
    "one can check that actually only the coherent scattering survives , giving a @xmath141-contribution in @xmath129 to the complete spectrum .",
    "if the freezing of the atom is only approximate , or if one tries to maximize the atomic squeezing ( which is another way of stopping the atomic motion ) , one can check that all the spectra tend to become flatter and the squeezing tends to disappear .",
