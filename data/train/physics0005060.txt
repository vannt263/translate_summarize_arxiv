    "sub - doppler resolution for an inhomogeneously broadened medium based on multi - photon processes has attracted much attention in recent decades .",
    "the physical essence for this method lies in the fact that a detuning for multi - photon transition stipulated by doppler frequency shift can be reduced or eliminated by adopting appropriate light propagation direction , since the detuning is the sum or difference of multiple single - photon transition detunings .",

    "a widely used method is doppler - free two- or multi - photon absorption where the velocity dependent detuning could be removed in the case that the wave vectors of the interacting beams sum down to zero ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this type of sub - doppler spectrum is characterized by a large detuning from the intermediate resonance , measuring the fluorescence from the upper level as well as by small cross sections for these multi - photon processes . enhanced by intermediate resonance sub - doppler processes based on the use of strong driving fields and on a change of frequency - correlation properties of resonant multi - photon process in strong resonant fields ,",

    "substantial enhancement in absorption , gain and fluorescence controlled with the auxiliary appropriately propagating electro - magnetic wave has been predicted .",
    "an interference nature of the spectrum modification has been stressed , which implies that along the growth of the absorption ( gain ) in certain spectral intervals , integral over the frequency may even decrease .",
    "a role of increase of intensity of a probe field as well as features of doppler - free lasers were explored too .",
    "control of atomic response with intense coupling lasers has been a subject of many intensive studies in the context of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , amplification without inversion ( awi ) @xcite , enhancement of the refractive index without absorption @xcite and so on ( for review see @xcite ) .",

    ", four absorption peaks could be found on account of the fact that both the upper and lower states are split into autler - townes doublets .",
    "sub - doppler resolution is achievable because the modified two - photon transition occurs contributing in the probe process and two - photon detunings , resulting from the doppler shift , could be reduced by choosing appropriate optical geometry .",
    "a crucial role of the ratio of the frequencies of the coupled transitions is outlined .",
    "the results obtained on the basis of the developed theory are accompanied with numerical simulation addressed to real experimental schemes . despite the decreased integral intensity ,",

    "even though the dressed - state diagrams are similar in the two cases , the four - peak spectrum can not appear in rf because in the case of rf the dynamic stark splitting for the two doublets must be the same , while in our system the two doublet splittings are controlled separately by different driving field intensity and frequency .",

    "an important feature is that the maximum absorption occurs under the condition that the two rabi frequencies are equal , which is due to the fact that the two dressed - state transitions simultaneously contribute to the central component .",

    "direct computing shows that frequency integral absorption for the plot 3 is the same as for 5 , whereas for the other plots it is about 0.5 of that for the graph 5 .",

    "figure  [ f4 ] displays same dependencies , but for velocity averaged absorption index and co - propagating probe and driving fields . while number of peaks and their positions are identical to the previous case , the specific feature of the inhomogeneous broadening is that plot 1 displays enhanced absorption in the central component despite the fact that integral intensity of this graph is about 2 times less than that for the plot 4 ( due to the strong saturation of the populations at the transition @xmath122 ",

    "the predicted effects are attributed to the quantum coherence and interference processes , while frequency - correlation properties of multi - photon processes experience substantial modification with the growth of the driving fields intensities , which leads to corresponding dramatic changes of the role of doppler effects .",
