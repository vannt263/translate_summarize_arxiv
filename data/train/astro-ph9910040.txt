    "the @xmath0 relation for tp - agb stars , first discovered by paczyski ( 1970a ) , has since then been employed in many studies involving this evolutionary phase .",
    "it is a basic ingredient in synthetic calculations of tp - agb evolution , and an important tool for the interpretation of observational data for agb stars .",
    "what the @xmath0 relation means in the classical sense is simply that the quiescent luminosity of a tp - agb star in the full - amplitude regime is mainly controlled by its core mass , without any dependence on the mass of its outer envelope .",
    "various theoretical analyses have been performed in the past to explain the existence of the @xmath0 relation from first principles , using either homology relations ( refsdal & weigert 1970 ; havazelet & barkat 1979 ; kippenhahn 1981 ) , or the equations of stellar structure under specific physical conditions ( see eggleton 1967 ; paczyski 1970b ; tuchman et al .",
    "1983 ; jeffery 1988 ) .",
    "a transparent discussion of the validity of the @xmath0 relation was presented by tuchman et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , to whom the reader should refer .",
    "there it is shown that an @xmath0 relation _ necessarily _ holds when the star consists of :    * a _ degenerate core _ of mass @xmath1 surrounded by * a narrow _ radiative burning shell _ ( or double shell ) source providing most of the luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , beyond which there must exist * a _ thin _ ( with a mass @xmath3 ) and _ inert _ ( the luminosity is constant ) _ transition region in radiative equilibrium _ , extending up to the base of the convective envelope .    then , because of the extreme steepness of the structural gradients across the radiative inert zone , it follows that the thermal evolution of the core is decoupled from that of the envelope .",
    "the relationship between the core mass and the luminosity , defined on the ground of this physical picture , is of linear nature , as confirmed by numerical results ( e.g.  paczyski 1970a ; iben 1977 ; wood & zarro 1981 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988a ) .",
    "hereinafter , such linear relation will be referred to as _ the classical @xmath0 relation_.    however , such a simple @xmath0 relation does not hold for all agb stars .",
    "blcker & schnberner ( 1991 ) have shown that the @xmath0 relation can indeed break down in the most massive agb stars ( @xmath4 depending on the metallicity ) experiencing envelope burning ( or hot - bottom burning ) . in this context",
    ", substantial efforts have been made in order to accurately include this effect in synthetic tp - agb calculations ( marigo et al.1998 ; marigo 1998 ; wagenhuber & groenewegen 1998 ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that @xmath0 relations in synthetic calculations are always technically motivated relations intended to fit results of full stellar evolution calculations . by no means they are just the classical , physically motivated linear relations mentioned above . in the following , such relations will be referred to as _ technical @xmath0 relations_.    very recently , herwig et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereinafter hsb98 ) have claimed that the classical @xmath0 relation may also be violated in low - mass agb stars , as a consequence of efficient third dredge - up .",
    "more specifically , they present evolutionary sequences with a dredge - up efficiency close to @xmath5 or even higher is defined as the ratio between the dredged - up mass and the core mass increase during each inter - pulse period .",
    "] , i.e. characterized by an almost constant or slightly decreasing core mass @xmath1 . despite of this fact",
    ", these sequences are found to evolve at increasing luminosity .",
    "this behavior is in apparent contradiction with the trend expected from the classical @xmath0 relation , predicting lower luminosities at lower core masses .    in the present study",
    "we address the question whether these results present a _ further _",
    "deviation from the classical @xmath0 relation , as claimed by hsb98 , or if they can be explained , at least partly , by the already known ( and understood ) deviations .",
    "a violation of the classical @xmath0 relation implies that , for some reason , the configuration defined in tuchman et al .  ( 1983 ) is altered .",
    "for instance , the occurrence of hot - bottom burning ( or envelope burning ) in the most massive tp - agb stars causes the inert radiative buffer to disappear , due to the deep penetration of the convective envelope into the h - burning shell .",
    "another example refers to the first inter - pulse periods , when the luminosity of a tp - agb star is found to be lower than predicted by the classical @xmath0 relation for the same @xmath1 . in these initial stages",
    "the condition @xmath6 is not actually fulfilled , as the gravitational contraction of the core and the he - burning shell provide non - negligible contributions to the surface luminosity .    in the context of the recent results by hsb98 ,",
    "the first natural question is : does the third dredge - up in low mass tp - agb stars lead to a real violation of the classical @xmath0 relation ?",
    "in other words , is any of the conditions listed above not fulfilled ?",
    "the answer is : no .",
    "in fact , the degenerate core and the h - burning shell still exist in the quiescent regime after the dredge - up has occurred , as does the radiative inert buffer , since hsb98 are only considering stars which do not experience hot - bottom burning .",
    "the second question is : if the basic conditions for the existence of the classical @xmath0 relation are still fulfilled , what causes the deviation from the linear @xmath0 relation ?      in order to answer the latter question , let us consider the previously known deviations from the classical @xmath0 relation .    the first effect to consider is the initial luminosity evolution of tp - agb stars .",
    "in complete calculations of agb stars the first thermal pulses still take place during a phase of fast core contraction , at luminosities lower than given by the classical , linear @xmath0 relation . during a few thermal pulses ,",
    "the luminosity gradually approaches this relation , up to the so - called _ full - amplitude regime_. during these first pulses unique relations between @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not expected to exist .",
    "the sequences of models shown by hsb98 in their figs .",
    "2 and 3 refer to a relatively small number of pulse cycles , most of which have not yet attained the full - amplitude regime .",
    "more specifically , the two evolutionary sequences they computed with overshooting , for @xmath9 ( labelled @xmath10 in hsb98 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) models , present only 14 and 12 thermal pulses , respectively . in each of these sequences , at least 6 of the pulse cycles are clearly in the sub - luminous phase which characterizes the first pulses . this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc ] .",
    "hsb98 compare their sequences with the @xmath0 relation from blcker ( 1993 ) .",
    "the latter is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc ] .",
    "this relation clearly predicts too faint luminosities if compared to the most luminous points in the sequences of models with no or little dredge - up , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this inappropriateness of the blcker @xmath0 relation to describe the present hsb98 models probably derive from the different input physics used in both sets of models .",
    "we therefore prefer to define another linear @xmath0 relation , more appropriate to describe the asymptotic behaviour of the hsb98 models without dredge - up .",
    "this is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc ] .",
    "this has been chosen to be the one which reasonably fits the 16 last inter - pulse periods ( out of 19 ) in the @xmath13 sequence , and the last 3 or 4 ( out of 23 ) in the @xmath14 one .",
    "both evolutionary sequences asymptotically approach this linear relation .    in all the hsb98 evolutionary tracks ,",
    "the first thermal pulses have luminosities which are lower than predicted by this asymptotic linear @xmath0 relation we adopt ( solid line ) . in the sequences with efficient dredge - up , only the very last quiescent models are more luminous than predicted by this relation for the same core masses .",
    "specifically , only the last 3 inter - pulse periods of the @xmath10 track , and the last 5 of the @xmath12 one are above the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the remaining points are all steadily increasing in luminosity , which is just the behavior expected for the first thermal pulses .",
    "the luminosity increase in the initial phase of the tp - agb evolution is partly due to the release of gravitational energy by the contracting core , and clearly constitutes a violation of the assumptions for the validity of the classical @xmath0 relation .",
    "however , this effect is well known and already taken into account in the technical @xmath0 relations in synthetic models ( e.g.  groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , 1999 ; marigo 1998 ; wagenhuber & groenewegen 1998 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the behavior of @xmath15 for the two sequences with efficient dredge - up clearly deviates from those of the sub - luminous pulses without dredge - up , such that the presence of an additional effect resulting from the dredge - up is likely .",
    "another important point is related to the change of the surface chemical composition produced by the third dredge - up , and thus to the composition dependence of the @xmath0 relation .    indeed , the fact that changes in the chemical composition of the envelope may affect  but do not violate  the classical @xmath16 relation had already been pointed out long ago from theoretical arguments ( e.g.  refsdal & weigert 1970 ; kippenhahn 1981 ; tuchman et al .  1983 ) . as clearly derived from tuchman et al .",
    "( 1983 ; see their equations  ( 1.17 ) and ( 1.29 ) ) the @xmath0 relation contains a non - negligible dependence on the composition of the envelope , essentially expressed by three parameters :    * a factor ( @xmath17 ) from the electron scattering opacity , * a factor ( @xmath18 ) from the mean molecular weight ( @xmath19 for a fully ionized gas ) , * a factor ( @xmath20 ) from the hydrogen burning rate .",
    "since then , various @xmath0 relations , both classical linear and technical ones which include a composition dependence , have been presented by different authors ( e.g.  lattanzio 1986 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988a ; wagenhuber & groenewegen 1998 ; tuchman & truran 1998 ) . from these studies it turns out that at any given core mass , the quiescent luminosity of a tp - agb star increases with increasing metallicity @xmath21 , helium content @xmath22 , ( both leading to a higher mean molecular weight @xmath23 ) , and cno abundances @xmath24 . for instance , based on calculations of full agb models , boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988a ) carefully analyzed the composition dependence , deriving a proportionality factor @xmath25 in their fitting formula of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "they found that at given core mass , stars of solar composition ( @xmath26 ) are @xmath27 more luminous than metal poor stars ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it follows that the occurrence of recurrent dredge - up episodes in tp - agb stars is expected to alter ( not to break ) even the classical @xmath0 relation , as a consequence of the increase of the mean molecular weight in the envelope .    of course",
    ", this effect has already been included in several synthetic calculations ( e.g.  groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; marigo 1998 ) , where @xmath0 relations with a metallicity dependence have been adopted . marigo ( 1998 ) has already pointed out that a deviation from the @xmath0 relation , corresponding to constant metallicity , can be caused by changes in the envelope composition .",
    "we have estimated , from the data presented in herwig et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereinafter hbse97 ) , herwig ( 1998 ) and hsb98 , the total change in the envelope composition due to the dredge - up events . for the @xmath29 @xmath10 track",
    ", the mean molecular weight @xmath23 is estimated to increase from 0.6314 to 0.6394 during the tp - agb evolution , whereas for the @xmath30 @xmath12 one , it increases from 0.6304 to 0.6376 .",
    "this implies that in both cases @xmath23 increases by 1.3 % in total . assuming @xmath31 ( following boothroyd & sackmann 1988a )",
    ", this change in the envelope chemical composition would imply a change of 4% in the luminosity predicted by the linear @xmath0 relation for constant metallicity .",
    "this already accounts for one - third of the luminosity increase above the @xmath16 relation drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc ] .",
    "hsb98 claim that their evolutionary sequences do not present hot - bottom burning , since their core masses are `` lower than those associated to hot - bottom burning '' ( hbb ) .",
    "the highest core mass in their tracks is @xmath32 , whereas they consider hbb to be present only at higher core masses .",
    "however , the knowledge of the core mass is not enough to diagnose the possible occurrence of hbb .",
    "several authors ( boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ; vassiliadis & wood 1993 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1996 ; marigo 1998 ) find that the presence of hbb , and its associated `` over - luminosity '' , are sensitive to other stellar parameters as well , as e.g.  the envelope mass , metallicity , mixing - length parameter , and to the details of the convection theory .",
    "the latter results have been obtained by means of stellar models that adopt canonical convection theories .",
    "it would be interesting to quantify whether the diffusive overshooting scheme applied by hsb98 to all convective boundaries , may also produce conditions favorable to hbb , i.e.  higher temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope at lower core masses .",
    "if this were the case the over - luminosity of the tracks may be partially ascribed to the occurrence of ( a possibly mild ) hbb . in this respect , however , no conclusion can be drawn without additional information about the hbs98 tracks .",
    "as remarked above , most of the luminosity behavior of the hsb98 tracks can be understood by means of already known effects taking place during the tp - agb evolution .",
    "hbs98 , however , explicitly mention a violation of the classical @xmath0 relation caused by dredge - up , and provide an explanation for the unusual behavior of their tracks based on the stellar core radius .",
    "the authors find that the core radii , @xmath33 , of their tp - agb models follow quite different paths in the @xmath34 plane , depending on whether the models experience dredge - up or not .",
    "then , considering the apparent lack of a unique @xmath35 relationship and using the homology relation @xmath36 , hsb98 conclude that the luminosity is not a function of @xmath1 alone , but also of @xmath33 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath0 relation should rather be seen as a @xmath37 relation .    moreover ,",
    "hsb98 claim that the over - luminosity above the @xmath0 relation of their evolutionary sequences with @xmath38 can be explained assuming @xmath39 a fact we can not confirm . in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc2 ] , we plot the luminosity evolution of the hsb98 @xmath30 sequences , as derived both from their @xmath8 and @xmath1 values ( from their figs .  2 and 3 ; filled symbols ) .",
    "we then use the @xmath1 and @xmath33 values in order to obtain the equivalent luminosity from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lmc2 ] ) above .",
    "this procedure however requires that we fix a value to the constant in this equation .",
    "the first point of the @xmath12 sequence is used for this purpose , so that we obtain the relation @xmath40 ( where all quantities are in solar units ) .",
    "the open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc2 ] then show the luminosities as obtained from this latter relation .    in this way , we have obtained the equivalent of fig .  4 in hsb98 .",
    "we find that the luminosities as derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lmc2 ] ) are far from reproducing those given by the complete evolutionary sequences , although the general behaviour is similar .",
    "in contrast , hsb98 obtain quite a good match between the two sets of curves .",
    "examining their fig .  4 , and comparing it with fig .",
    "[ fig_lmc2 ] , we conclude that hbs98 adopt two different scales in their plot ( i.e. for the true luminosity and for the luminosity as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lmc2 ] ) ) , which are not related by a single multiplicative constant .",
    "thus , their explanation of the luminosity evolution in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq_lmc2 ] ) is misleading , since obviously , the `` constant '' they adopt varies from model to model along the evolutionary sequences .",
    "the possible dependence of the luminosity on core radius deserves the following remarks .",
    "this dependence would reflect the release of gravitational energy by the contracting core . during the tp - agb evolution , the core contracts more rapidly during the first thermal pulses , until an almost constant and very low contraction rate is established in the full - amplitude regime ( herwig 1998 ) .",
    "another concurring effect comes from the decrease of the ratio @xmath41 between the gas and the total pressure at increasing luminosities .",
    "the homology relation actually predicts @xmath42 , where the exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in equation  3 of hsb98 . since @xmath45 , the radius dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq_lmc2 ] ) vanishes as we increase @xmath8 and hence @xmath46 .    for both reasons ,",
    "an @xmath0 relation independent of @xmath33 should hold after a certain time .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations by hsb98 have been stopped at the most important point , i.e. where the evolution of the core radius as a function of the core mass for the models with efficient dredge - up joins the standard @xmath34 relation described by the models without dredge - up after the initial pulses ( see their figure 3 ) . if , from this point on , both relations follow the same path , then the entire effect presented by hsb98 is indeed related to peculiar behaviour of the first pulses , before the settling of the full - amplitude regime . in this case , there would be no real violation of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "otherwise , if there is a different dependence of the core radius upon the core mass , the @xmath0 relation might be at least partly modified .",
    "if this were the case , it would be quite important to single out the physical effect produced by the convective dredge - up , which occurs at a thermal pulse , on the core radius during the subsequent quiescent evolution .",
    "in other words , why should the evolution of the core radius turn out different between models with and without dredge - up ?",
    "this point is not clear in the hsb98 analysis .    to this respect ,",
    "an interesting point is discussed by tuchman et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , in their analytical demonstration of the @xmath0 relation from first principles . in brief , the authors shows that core radius of an agb star is larger than the radius of an ideal zero - temperature white dwarf ( for which a unique linear @xmath34 relation exists ) by a multiplicative factor , @xmath47 , which depends both on the core mass @xmath1 and on the temperature @xmath48 at the top of the h - burning shell ( i.e. bottom of the overlying inert radiative buffer ; see their equations 1.18 and 1.19 ) .",
    "this factor @xmath47 , being typically @xmath49 for relevant burning shells , decreases with @xmath1 and increases with @xmath48 .",
    "hence , in order to get a greater shrinkage of the core in the agb models with efficient dredge - up , while the core mass is kept constant , a lower temperature @xmath48 should be attained during the quiescent regime .",
    "this , in fact , would result in a smaller @xmath47 , and hence in a smaller @xmath33 .",
    "the final result would be a certain excess of luminosity with respect to the reference @xmath0 relation .",
    "unfortunately , no information about @xmath48 is given in hsb98 , but it would be worth investigating this point with the aid of full agb calculations .",
    "here we present the results of synthetic calculations carried out with different technical @xmath0 relations including a composition dependence and the first subluminous pulses ( see figs .  [ lmcgrid ] and [ lmcd ] ) .",
    "the models are meant to be useful experiments , giving a first hint of how the quiescent luminosity of a tp - agb star may behave when dredge - up events strongly alter the envelope composition .",
    "calculations are carried out over a limited number of inter - pulse periods for a 3 @xmath50 tp - agb star with original solar composition ( i.e. @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the envelope at the first thermal pulse is characterised by ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the third dredge - up is assumed to occur once the full amplitude regime is attained , i.e. after the first subluminous pulses when the linear @xmath0 relation is approached .",
    "we adopt various values of the dredge - up parameter ( @xmath54 ) and two prescriptions for the composition of the dredged - up material .",
    "they are ( in mass fraction ) :    * @xmath55he@xmath56 , @xmath57c@xmath58 , @xmath59o@xmath60 + ( according to boothroyd & sackmann 1988b ; bs88 ) * @xmath55he@xmath61 , @xmath57c@xmath62 , @xmath59o@xmath61 + ( according to hbse97 )    here we are not concerned to give a detailed description of dredge - up and its properties . for instance , we assume that dredge - up events take place at each thermal pulse in the full amplitude regime , whereas we expect that a significant increase of the envelope metallicity could , at a certain stage , even inhibit further occurrence of the process by decreasing the temperature at the base of the convective envelope during the post - flash luminosity maximum ( see e.g.  boothroyd & sackmann 1988c ) .",
    "since most available @xmath0 formulae were obtained for relatively small ranges of metallicity , usually not super - solar , they may not give realistic results if the envelope metallicity increases to very high values .",
    "however , in this respect , the recent analysis developed by tuchman & truran ( 1998 ) is relevant .",
    "they have quantitatively investigated the composition influence upon the @xmath16 relation , in order to better estimate the luminosity of classical novae , objects in which shell hydrogen burning is known to occur in extremely metal - rich material ( e.g.  @xmath63 ) . at such high values of the metallicity , the corresponding @xmath64 relation is shifted to significantly higher luminosities than predicted for solar composition .    figure  [ lmcgrid ] shows the locus traced by the @xmath65 tp - agb model experiencing dredge - up , adopting an efficiency @xmath66 and the hbse97 prescription for the chemical composition of the inter - shell .",
    "a grid of classical @xmath0 relations ( from boothroyd & sackmann 1988a ) is also plotted for increasing values of the mean molecular weight , ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 in steps of about @xmath69 .",
    "the envelope composition of the last calculated model ( @xmath70 pulse ) is characterised by ( @xmath71 ) . for a core mass @xmath72",
    "the quiescent luminosity is @xmath73 , corresponding to an over - luminosity of about @xmath74 with respect to the case in which the chemical composition were unchanged and equal to that of the first thermal pulse .",
    "other examples are presented in fig .",
    "all models show that the deviations from the @xmath0 relation at constant metallicity are greater for increasing @xmath75 and/or for higher abundances of carbon and oxygen in the inter - shell .",
    "we can also note that models with @xmath76 also evolve to luminosities above the reference @xmath0 relation , despite the effective decrease of the core mass .",
    "finally , we remark that our synthetic results shown in fig .",
    "[ lmcd ] reproduce the behavior of the luminosity as found by hsb98 .",
    "for instance , the cases with @xmath77 and @xmath66 clearly resemble the sequences b@xmath78 and b@xmath79 in their fig .  2 , respectively . however , it must be specified that in our calculations with extremely efficient dredge - up ( @xmath80 ) , a considerable over - luminosity above the @xmath0 relation shows up after a much larger number of dredge - up episodes ( @xmath81 ) if compared to the results by hsb98 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this difference can be partly ascribed to the fact that in our case the onset of third dredge - up occurs only when the full - amplitude regime is attained , whereas in hsb98 dredge - up takes place from the first thermal pulses on , when other effects ( in addition to the chemical composition , see sects .",
    "[ sec_initpulses ] and [ other ] ) are likely to play a role .",
    "in this paper we claim that the results from hsb98 may partially be understood by means of the already known deviations from the classical linear @xmath0 relation .",
    "an important effect certainly present in their evolutionary calculations is the increase in luminosity associated with the initial core contraction that occurs during the first thermal pulse cycles of any tp - agb star .",
    "this phase of rapid luminosity evolution represents a substantial fraction of the tracks presented by hsb98 . in order to determine if dredge - up really leads to a violation of the classical @xmath0 relation , which is expected to hold for the later evolution of agb stars ,",
    "the hsb98 evolutionary sequences should be extended in order to include a much larger number of thermal pulses .      1 .   the small or negative changes in the core mass from pulse to pulse , which cause the tracks to evolve almost vertically in the @xmath0 diagram , instead of along a line of increasing core mass and luminosity .",
    "the changes in the surface chemical composition which make their quiescent luminosity deviate from that predicted by an @xmath0 relation obtained for a constant value of metallicity .",
    "none of these effects , however , implies a violation of the classical @xmath0 relation . the structural conditions for the existence of a @xmath0 relation",
    "are expected to hold only after the tracks enter in the full - amplitude regime , as remarked above .    in this regard ,",
    "we remark that the evolutionary tracks should be compared with the @xmath0 relation obtained from the current chemical composition of the envelope , and not with those obtained from tracks of constant metallicity .",
    "also , the possible presence of hot - bottom burning should be completely ruled out before we can tell about deviations from the @xmath0 relation .",
    "it would be of particular interest , for instance , to investigate the evolution of low - mass stars ( @xmath83 ) computed with a similar algorithm for convection as in hsb98 .",
    "it turns out that the correct interpretation of hsb98 results requires the analysis of additional quantities along their evolutionary tracks , other than the core mass , luminosity , and core radius .",
    "these quantities are : the fraction of the stellar luminosity provided by the release of gravitational energy ( necessary to identify if the full - amplitude regime has been reached ) , the surface chemical composition of the models ( necessary to better quantify the deviation from the initial @xmath0 relation due to composition changes ) ; the luminosity provided by nuclear burning in the convective envelope ( necessary to rule out the presence of hot - bottom burning ) ; and the temperature @xmath48 at the top of the h - burning shell ( useful to investigate its effect on the factor @xmath47 , defined in sect .",
    "[ other ] , and hence on the core radius @xmath33 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this information is not provided by hsb98 .",
    "we stress once more that synthetic tp - agb models have already been adopting _ technical non - linear _ @xmath0 relations , i.e.including significant deviations from linearity due to the sub - luminous first thermal pulses and changes in the surface chemical composition produced by dredge - up ( e.g.  groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .",
    "1996 ; marigo 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the real breakdown of the @xmath0 relation caused by hot - bottom burning in the most massive agb stars have been accurately taken into account ( marigo et al.1998 ; marigo 1998 ; wagenhuber & groenewegen 1998 ) in these models . finally , we recall that the @xmath0 relation applies only to the quiescent inter - pulse periods , but not to the luminosity variations driven by thermal pulses .",
    "even the effect of the post - flash low - luminosity dip is usually included in synthetic tp - agb calculations .    therefore , synthetic agb evolution calculations already include all known effects affecting the @xmath15-relation and do not rely on the assumption that the classical , linear @xmath0 relation is valid .",
    "a corresponding comment in hsb98 turns out to be inappropriate . as such , any _ new _ effect , as possibly indicated by the hsb98 calculations can easily be incorporated after sufficient data from full calculations are available .",

    "<S> the core mass - luminosity ( @xmath0 ) relation of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars is a key ingredient in synthetic calculations of their evolution . recently , herwig et al .  ( </S>",
    "<S> 1998 ) have presented full calculations of tp - agb models with strong dredge - up occurring already during early thermal pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting luminosity evolution differs appreciably from the simple linear @xmath0 relation .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that at least part of the luminosity evolution can be understood as being the result of two well - known effects : the gradual approach to the asymptotic behaviour that characterises the first thermal pulses , and the chemical composition changes of the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are already implemented in the @xmath0 relations used in synthetic models . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these models are able to reproduce the behaviour of full calculations . whether additional effects , not yet taken into account , are present , can be decided only through additional calculations and data </S>",
    "<S> . we also comment on the validity of a linear @xmath0 relation and its possible violation , as mentioned by herwig et al . </S>"
