    "a question still open to debate is how elliptical galaxies are formed .",
    "three scenarios have been proposed to address this issue : _ ( i ) _ monolithic collapse of gas clouds linked to high energy dissipation rates @xcite ; _ ( ii ) _ galaxy merger @xcite ; and _ ( iii ) _ hybrid models that involve an early monolithic collapse followed by merger events at later times @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the monolithic collapse ( associated to a large - scale star formation ) is that a conspicuous metallicity gradient is expected to establish along the full range of galactic radius ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , if merger events are important , the gradient is expected to disappear .",
    "a few ellipticals present strong signs of recent dynamical perturbation @xcite , which may provide important clues to their formation processes and evolution .",
    "important information on the above issues has been derived from metal line - strength indices ( e.g. @xcite ) and their radial variation within galaxies .",
    "@xmath10 line - strength distribution in early - type galaxies , for example , can vary considerably , ranging from essentially featureless to structured profiles showing , e.g. , changes of slope possibly associated with kinematically decoupled cores , or anomalies in the stellar population of some ellipticals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the origin of the ionized gas in ellipticals is another controversial issue , because until recently it was believed that the interstellar medium ( ism ) in these galaxies was not significant .",
    "however , studies by , e.g. @xcite have shown that more than 50% of the elliptical and lenticular galaxies contain significant amounts of ionized gas .",
    "more recently , @xcite have traced ionized gas in a sample of 73 elliptical and so galaxies by means of narrow - band filters centered on @xmath11 and [ nii ] .",
    "they detected emission gas in about 3/4 of the galaxies , with masses amounting to @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    in the present work",
    "we investigate properties of the elliptical galaxies ngc6868 and ngc5903 , because previous studies have shown that they contain important interstellar medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , have complex stellar and gas kinematics ( @xcite ) . besides , both ellipticals belong to galaxy groups , which might imply past close encounters ( and even mergers ) with companions .",
    "potential consequences of such past interactions are the triggering of discrete star formation events with stellar populations differing in metallicity and age ( @xcite ) and the presence of large - scale dynamical perturbations that may affect galaxy morphology by building subsystems such as a stellar and/or dust disk ( @xcite ) . in this context , ngc6868 and ngc5903 can be taken as interesting candidates where the stellar population and metallicity distribution can be investigated , which are important parameters to understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to investigate , by means of long - slit spectroscopy , the origin , star - formation history , metallicity and ionized gas distribution in ngc6868 and ngc5903 .",
