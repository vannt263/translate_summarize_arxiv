    "weak decays of heavy hadrons @xcite present a very rich field of phenomena owing to the complexity of confinement . being the bound states of a heavy - quark and light - constituents ( mesons , singly charmed / bottom baryons ) or even of two heavy quarks and one light constituent ( doubly charmed / bottom baryons ) , heavy hadrons contain soft degrees of freedom which generate nonperturbative power corrections , such as the destructive and/or constructive pauli interference and the w - exchange / annihilation between the quark coming from the heavy - quark decay and one of the light constituents .",
    "inclusive decay rates and lifetimes of charmed mesons were reasonably reliably calculated in the last decade .",
    "the overall picture emerging is qualitatively satisfactory and the lifetime hierarchy has been predicted for singly charmed baryons and found to be in agreement with present experiments @xcite .",
    "also , the difference in lifetimes ( a factor of 2 - 3 ) between @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , which is due to the negative pauli interference preasymptotic effect , was explained a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations performed in the middle of the eighties @xcite provided us with the predictions of a lifetime pattern which has recently been confirmed by experiment .",
    "this success is rather surprising since with the advent of the systematic operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite and heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite it has become clear that the charmed quark mass is not heavy enough for the @xmath6 expansion to be trustworthy .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that employing systematically field - theory methods to the very end of the calculation ( up to the hadronic wave function for which we have to rely upon some phenomenological models ) , one is able to make clear predictions to be compared with present and future experiments and possibly to disentangle between various preasymptotic effects .    on the other hand",
    ", the inverse bottom quark mass appears to be a good expansion parameter in bottom decays .",
    "however , the role of four quark operators is negligible there ( effects of the @xmath7 ) leaving charmed hadron decays as a playground for studying such effects and as a test of the possible violation of the quark - hadron duality .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of singly charmed baryons decays and lifetimes @xcite to the case of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "recently @xcite , a rather phenomenological approach using effective constituent quark masses and fit of singly charmed baryon decays has been employed to study doubly charmed baryon decays .",
    "we , however , have used a systematic field - theory approach to the very end in order to be consistent with the previous treatment of singly charmed hadrons and have also included the preasymptotic effects in semileptonic decay rates of doubly charmed baryons , thus calculating all decay rates at the cabibbo subleading level .",
    "we show that preasymptotic effects dramatically change the simple spectator picture and lead to a very clear pattern of semileptonic branching ratios and lifetimes .",
    "using the optical theorem , the inclusive decay width of a hadron @xmath8 with mass @xmath9 containing two heavy @xmath10 quarks can be written as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the transition operator    @xmath13    in the following we use the operator product expansion which is based on the assumption that the energy release in the decay of a @xmath10 quark is large enough .",
    "this implies that momenta flowing through internal lines are also large and therefore justify the ope .",
    "the general formula for the decay is given by @xcite    @xmath14    here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are wilson coefficient functions which are known at one - loop order and tree level , respectively @xcite .",
    "v represents appropriate matrix elements of the ckm matrix .",
    "let us calculate the semileptonic decay rates first .",
    "the main contribution is expected to come from the quark decay - type diagram , which is proportional to @xmath17 and is given , to @xmath18 , as    @xmath19    here @xmath20 and @xmath21 parametrize the matrix elements of the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic operators , respectively .",
    "their determination will be discussed later .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the abbreviations @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the cabibbo angle ) .",
    "the next contribution is coming from the dimension - five operator    @xmath27    note that in both ( [ eq : sldec ] ) and ( [ eq : slg ] ) there is an additional factor 2 coming from the decays of _ two _ @xmath10 quarks in the doubly charmed baryon .",
    "the phase - space corrections @xmath28 and @xmath29 are cited explicitly in the appendix .",
    "the radiative qcd correction @xmath30 @xcite is given by    @xmath31    where for @xmath32 we have    @xmath33    and @xmath34 .",
    "leptons are taken to be massless .",
    "recently , voloshin has noticed @xcite that preasymptotic effects in _ semileptonic _ inclusive decays can be very large owing to the constructive pauli interference , the result up to the ckm matrix element being given by    @xmath35    here @xmath36 is a correction due to the hybrid renormalization of the effective lagrangian and it takes care of the evolution of @xmath37 from @xmath38 down to the typical hadronic scale @xmath39 .",
    "the factor 5 in front of @xmath40 reflects the spin structure of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "the baryon wave function @xmath41 will be discussed later .    the total semileptonic rate for one lepton species is given by    @xmath42    where    @xmath43    in view of the significant preasymptotic effects in the sl decay rates of singly charmed baryons",
    ", one can expect a large pauli - interference contribution in the semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath2 baryon ( @xmath44 quark structure ) , where that contribution is present at the leading cabibbo level .",
    "nonleptonic decay rates are slightly more complicated , since in the final state the lepton pair is substituted by a quark pair",
    ". the contributions analogous to ( [ eq : sldec ] ) and ( [ eq : slg ] ) are ( including @xmath45 corrections )    @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & [ 1 -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu_{\\pi}^2(h_{cc})}{m_c^2 } + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu_{g}^2(h_{cc})}{m_c^2 } ]   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2 ( c_{+}^2 - c_{-}^2)[((c^4+s^4)p_{2}(x)+ c^2 s^2)\\eta_{nl}(x)+\\nonumber \\\\ & & c^2 s^2 \\tilde{p}_{2}(x)\\tilde{\\eta}_{nl}(x))]\\ } ( -2 \\frac{\\mu_{g}^2(h_{cc})}{m_{c}^{2 } } ) \\ , . \\ ] ]    radiative corrections to the nonleptonic decay , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are far more complicated than analogous corrections ( [ eq : etasl ] ) and ( [ eq : slmass ] ) to the semileptonic decay and the reader is referred to the original paper where they were first calculated @xcite .",
    "again , the preasymptotic effects are expected to contribute significantly to the total nonleptonic decay rate .",
    "they are given by    @xmath50\\,5|\\psi(0)|^2\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma^{int}_{- } & = & \\frac{g_f^2}{2\\pi } m_c^2 [ -\\frac{1}{2 } c_{+}(2 c_{-}- c_{+ } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & -   \\frac{1}{6}(1 - \\sqrt{\\kappa})(5 c_{+}^2 + c_{-}^2 - 6 c_{+ } c_{- } ) ] \\,5|\\psi(0)|^2 \\,,\\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma^{int}_{+ } & = & \\frac{g_f^2}{2\\pi } m_c^2 [ \\frac{1}{2 } c_{+}(2 c_{-}+ c_{+ } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -   \\frac{1}{6}(1 - \\sqrt{\\kappa})(5 c_{+}^2 + c_{-}^2 + 6 c_{+ } c_{- } ) ] \\,5|\\psi(0)|^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an explicit calculation leads to the following nonleptonic decay rates :    @xmath51    all corrections @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "an important remark to be made here concerns the mass parameters in the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "whenever we perform an expansion which is essentially a field - theoretic procedure ( either the ope for the transition operator @xmath12 or the hqet expansion in the case of the @xmath56 operator ) , the expansion parameter is always the current heavy - quark running mass @xmath38 . on the other hand , in the calculation of the matrix elements , which is performed within quark models ,",
    "it is more appropriate to use constituent quark masses @xmath57 .    following this procedure , we give the expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for @xmath54 , we have    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the average heavy - quark velocity in the @xmath60 baryon , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constituent masses of the heavy and the light quark , respectively , and t is the average kinetic energy of the light quark and the heavy diquark .",
    "the precise description of this calculation is given in @xcite and relies upon some phenomenological features of the meson potential .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath55 operator , connected to the matrix element of the chromomagnetic operator , can be divided into two parts .",
    "the first part includes effects coming from the heavy - light chromomagnetic interaction and these contributions can also be found in the singly charmed baryon @xmath63 .",
    "the second part comprises effects originating within the heavy diquark , i.e. heavy - heavy chromomagnetic interactions .",
    "these effects are new @xcite and characteristic of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "their estimation relies upon the nonrelativistic qcd model calculation @xcite .",
    "the final expression is    @xmath64    where the first term describes the heavy diquark - light quark hyperfine interaction , while the second and the third correspond to the interaction of two heavy @xmath10-quarks in a diquark state .",
    "they are of the `` chromomagnetic '' and `` darwin '' type , respectively .",
    "in ( [ eq : mug ] ) , @xmath65 is the mass of the doubly charmed baryon , @xmath66 is the mass of its @xmath67 spin counterpart and @xmath68 is the wavefunction of the @xmath3 pair in the heavy diquark , i.e. @xmath69 is the probability for these two heavy quarks to meet at one point .    in the calculations above , up to the hadronic matrix elements we have used field theory only .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of the baryon wave function @xmath70 and the matrix elements of the kinetic and chromomagnetic operators , which are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the use of the usual singly charmed baryon wave function @xmath71 , as given in @xcite , would be premature , since intuitively , one expects a two - heavy - quark system to behave differently from the single - heavy - quark one .    in the case of singly charmed baryons ,",
    "the heavy quark is `` sitting '' in the centre of the baryon and the other two light quarks are moving around .",
    "their spin and the color charges are correlated ( in order to have the appropriate spin and color structure of the entire baryon ) , but their spatial motion is not . in this way , one has a three - body picture of the baryon containing a single heavy quark and one should use the baryonic wave function @xmath71 accordingly .    in the case of doubly charmed baryons , one assumes that two heavy quarks are strongly bound into a color antitriplet state .",
    "as far as the light quark is concerned , the bound state of two @xmath3-quarks appears as a pointlike diquark object @xcite .",
    "thus , in the heavy - quark limit , which can ( presumably ) still be applied in our case ( @xmath72 ) , a doubly charmed baryon appears to consist of a heavy diquark and a light quark forming a `` meson '' state .",
    "therefore , one expects that the wave function of the doubly charmed baryon ( which has to be considered as the light - quark wave function at the origin of the @xmath3-diquark ) behaves essentially as the mesonic wave function .",
    "we use the derivation of hyperfine splittings of mesons calculated in the constituent nonrelativistic quark model by de rjula et al @xcite to obtain the following relation between the wave functions of the doubly charmed baryon and the d - meson : @xmath73    the factor @xmath74 comes from the different spin content of doubly charmed baryons , i.e. the @xmath3-diquark forms the spin-1 color antitriplet state .",
    "the baryonic wave function squared in ( [ eq : psi ] ) is directly proportional to the d - meson decay constant , @xmath75 , squared .",
    "the factor @xmath76 is the effect of the hybrid renormalization which accounts for the fact that @xmath75 is measured at the scale @xmath77 , and one has to evolve @xmath75 down to the hadronic scale @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of the mesonic wave function @xmath79 , instead of the singly charmed baryon wave function @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the static value of the d - meson decay constant , also seems to be consistent numerically . in figure 1 .",
    "we have displayed the dependence of the @xmath82 on @xmath83 in the large range of the @xmath75 values . in our numerical calculation",
    "we use @xmath84 as a central value .",
    "this value is consistent both with qcd lattice calculations @xcite and qcd sum rules calculations @xcite .",
    "in the case of @xmath85 there is a negative pauli interference which cancels the contribution coming from the decay - type diagram ( [ eq : nldec ] ) and the chromomagnetic operator ( [ eq : nlg ] ) .",
    "this case is very similar to the role of the negative pauli interference in the @xmath4 decay where it competes with the decay - diagram contribution .",
    "for @xmath86 large enough , the nonleptonic and total rates in both @xmath4 and @xmath0 decays become negative , fig.1 .",
    "however , a reasonable choice of @xmath86 gives positive results .    in view of these facts and results",
    ", we may conclude that the phenomenological rule of using @xmath75 in mesonic and its static value @xmath81 in baryonic systems , employed first in singly charmed hadrons @xcite , can be successfully extended to the consideration of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "not doing so , but taking @xmath81 instead of @xmath86 would lead us to the unphysical region .",
    "so , our result is a confirmation of the above mentioned phenomenological rule at the same , qualitative level . taking this rule as postulated for singly charmed hadrons",
    ", we can interpret our results as an extension of the same rule into the doubly charmed sector .",
    "also , we can generalize the rule to some extent .",
    "we see that the use of @xmath86 is required in singly charmed mesons and doubly charmed baryons , while @xmath81 is used in singly charmed baryons @xcite .",
    "so , it is allowed to say that @xmath86 should be used in systems with two - body dynamics ( in the @xmath60 baryon case , a heavy diquark and a light quark ) and @xmath81 in systems with three - body dynamics .",
    "it is important to stress that these considerations and conclusions are of purely phenomenological origin , i.e. they have no direct justification in field theory .",
    "in numerical calculations we use the following set of parameters , which closely follows the set used in @xcite . for @xmath87 , the wilson coefficients are @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the charmed quark mass is taken to be @xmath90 and for the strange quark mass we use @xmath91 .",
    "the value of the average kinetic energy @xmath92 , appearing explicitly in ( [ eq : mupi ] ) , is taken from @xcite to be @xmath93 , and the light and heavy - quark constituent masses are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the numerical value of the diquark wave function is also taken from @xcite to be @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical values for masses of doubly charmed baryons are taken from @xcite .",
    "as far as the @xmath97 dependence is concerned , in the range @xmath98 the lifetimes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are practically constant and the lifetime of @xmath0 is more sensitive to the value of @xmath97 , being somewhat @xmath99 larger for @xmath100 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath101-dependence in the reasonable range @xmath102 .",
    "the lifetimes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 stay almost constant with variation of @xmath101 , and the lifetime of @xmath0 grows slowly with @xmath101 ( by @xmath103 ) , fig.2 .",
    "@xmath104 & @xmath105 & @xmath106 +   + @xmath107 & 0.345 & 4.158 & 2.859 +   + @xmath108 & 0.151 & 0.173 & 0.603 +   + @xmath109 & 23.4 & 3.9 & 14.9 +   + @xmath110 & 1.55 & 0.22 & 0.25 +    from table 1 one can see that the voloshin type of preasymptotic corrections in the semileptonic decay rates of @xmath2 is significant , contributing at the cabibbo leading level , eq .",
    "( [ eq : slvol ] ) .",
    "this contribution brings @xmath111 to be four times larger than @xmath112 , which receives contributions only from ( [ eq : sldec ] ) and ( [ eq : slg ] ) . in the @xmath113",
    "there is the pauli interference effect at the cabibbo suppressed level , but it still makes the rate larger by @xmath114 than that for the @xmath0 baryon .    clearly , since both semileptonic and nonleptonic rates are significantly affected by the large preasymptotic effects which are proportional to latexmath:[$|\\psi(0 )    branching ratio for @xmath2 depend crucially on the choice of @xmath86 .",
    "the latter is obvious from fig.3 , where",
    "@xmath111 grows linearly with @xmath116 and especially from the second picture in fig .",
    "3 , where it is clear that @xmath117 shows instability for @xmath86 larger than @xmath118 owing to the large cancelation between the negative pauli interference term and the contributions from eqs . ( [ eq : nldec ] ) and ( [ eq : nlg ] ) .",
    "this is a clear signal that one should not take the results for @xmath0 too literally .    keeping the above remarks in mind ,",
    "we predict the following pattern for semileptonic branching ratios :    @xmath119    and the following pattern for the lifetimes :    @xmath120    we can compare our results with the calculations of lifetimes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which appeared recently @xcite .",
    "the authors of that paper employed a similar field - theory technique , but had a different approach to the choice of relevant parameters . throughout their paper",
    "they used the constituent heavy - quark mass as an expansion parameter , which is a phenomenological procedure that we do not find fully consistent . in the calculation of semileptonic decay rates",
    ", they did not include large preasymptotic effects which significantly change total semileptonic widths .",
    "comparison shows that our numerical results are significantly different from those of kiselev et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth discussing briefly the decay of the heaviest weakly decaying charmed hadron , the triply charmed baryon @xmath121 .",
    "although its complicated structure and its intrinsic tree - body motion prevent us from applying to this particle the heavy - light picture as described above to other weakly decaying heavy hadrons , it is possible to give some qualitative predictions for the @xmath121 decay rate and the lifetime . in this baryon , preasymptotic effects ( giving large contributions in the singly and the doubly case ) do not exist for lack of light valence quarks .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution comes from the operators of dimensions three and five . since in",
    "doubly charmed decays the contribution of dimension - five operators represents less than @xmath122 of the contribution of the decay ( dimension three ) operator , it seems reasonable to approximate the total decay width of @xmath121 with the triple @xmath10-quark decay contribution and estimate the error of disregarding dimension - five operators at the level of @xmath122 . in this case",
    ", the expression for @xmath123 can be obtained by multiplying the expressions ( [ eq : sldec ] ) , ( [ eq : slg ] ) , ( [ eq : nldec ] ) and ( [ eq : nlg ] ) by a factor of @xmath67 , summing them and taking the limit @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the numerical value for the lifetime is    @xmath126    as the calculation of dimension - five operator contributions in triply charmed baryon decay rates is out of scope of the present paper , this result can be considered only as qualitatively correct .",
    "application of the heavy - quark expansion to the problem of inclusive decays of doubly charmed baryons enables us to give very interesting predictions for their lifetimes and semileptonic branching ratios .",
    "large lifetime differences are present between @xmath0 on the one hand and @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the other .",
    "our numerical results pick out @xmath0 as the longest living charmed particle ( fig.4 ) , although the numerical value for @xmath117 should be taken with certain reserve for reasons already mentioned .",
    "such a large numerical difference within the lifetime hierarchy makes these predictions suitable for testing by the first forthcoming experimental observation of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "a theoretical prediction for semileptonic branching ratios is even clearer and the hierarchy of @xmath109 is unambiguously determined .",
    "the total hierarchy of lifetimes for charmed hadrons is shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is evident that charmed hadrons show a very complex pattern in the @xmath127 plane .",
    "one can note that doubly charmed baryon lifetimes are comparable with those of their singly charmed counterparts .",
    "this result is just opposite to the naive expectation of roughly double widths in the doubly charmed case owing to the decay of two , instead of one @xmath10 quark , or , correspondingly twice smaller lifetimes of @xmath60 baryons .",
    "however , the mesonic nature of doubly charmed baryon wave functions , where one uses the smaller @xmath75 constant instead of its static @xmath128 value , reduces four - quark operator contributions , increasing doubly charmed baryon lifetimes .    although the @xmath10 quark is considered not being heavy enough to ensure a reasonable convergence of the heavy - quark expansion series , the numerical results in the singly charmed sector show satisfactory qualitative and even quantitative agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "if future experiments concerning the doubly ( and triply ) charmed sector should show similar agreement with our theoretical predictions , that would have important implications on the role of four - quark operators and the entire theory of heavy quark expansion . besides , the absence or the presence of agreement might have notable implications on the validity of the quark - hadron duality in the charmed sector .",
    "phase - space corrections can be understood as reduction of particle phase space due to the propagation of the massive particle in the loops of diagrams describing inclusive decays . in our case , we consider the @xmath129 quark to be massive , while the other particles ( @xmath130,@xmath131 quarks and leptons ) are treated as massless .",
    "these corrections can be classified according to the type of the the operator diagram in which they appear and according to the number of massive quarks in the loop ( or in a final state if we consider an inclusive process as a sum of exclusive channels ) .",
    "* one massive quark in the loop : + @xmath133 + @xmath134 + @xmath135 + @xmath136 appears as a correction to the decay - type diagram , while @xmath137 and @xmath138 come as corrections to the chromomagnetic operator .",
    "* two massive quarks in the loop : + using the notation @xmath139 + we have @xmath140 + @xmath141 + @xmath142                @xmath149 appears as a correction to the exchange diagram , @xmath150 corrects for the massive quark in the interference contributions , while @xmath151 is a correction in the case of negative interference when there are two massive quarks in the loop @xcite .",
