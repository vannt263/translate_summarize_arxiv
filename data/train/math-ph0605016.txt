    "the @xmath6-state potts model on a graph @xmath7 is defined initially for @xmath6 integer by the partition function @xmath8 \\,,\\ ] ] where the spins @xmath9 live on the vertices @xmath10 , and the interaction of strength @xmath11 is along the edges @xmath12 .",
    "this definition can be extended to arbitrary real values of @xmath6 through the high - temperature expansion of @xmath13 , yielding @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the number of connected components ( clusters ) and the cardinality ( number of links ) of the edge subsets @xmath17 .",
    "it is standard to introduce the temperature parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and to parametrize the interval @xmath20 by @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in two dimensions , much knowledge about the continuum - limit behaviour of the potts model",
    "has accumulated over the years , thanks mainly to the progress made in conformal field theory and the theory of integrable systems .",
    "this is particularly true at the ferromagnetic critical point , whereas much work remains to be done in the more difficult antiferromagnetic regime .    in this paper",
    ", we shall take a different point of view , and consider a number of combinatorial results which hold exactly true on arbitrary regular lattices of any finite size @xmath0 , and at any temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the choice of boundary conditions is clearly important . in the following",
    "we shall consider the _",
    "cyclic _ case ( free boundary conditions in the @xmath1-direction and periodic in the @xmath2-direction ) , and relegate the more complicated _ toroidal _ case ( periodic boundary conditions in both directions ) to a companion paper @xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we denote henceforth @xmath10 the number of vertices , @xmath12 the total number of edges , and @xmath25 the number of faces , including the exterior one .",
    "also , we often consider the lattice as being built up by a transfer matrix @xmath26 propagating in the @xmath2-direction , which we represent as horizontal .",
    "the case of cyclic boundary conditions has already been considered by pasquier and saleur @xcite , where it was shown how to decompose @xmath13 as a linear combination of characters @xmath27 ( with @xmath4 ) of representations of the quantum group @xmath28 .",
    "further developments were made independently in @xcite .",
    "chang and shrock @xcite recovered the same decomposition , but with @xmath27 defined as a partial trace of the transfer matrix @xmath29 in the spin representation .",
    "jacobsen and salas @xcite used a similar decomposition , but with @xmath27 defined as a matrix element of a transfer matrix in the cluster representation involving two time - slices .",
    "we show here that all three points of view are in fact equivalent , and that the characters @xmath27 obtained are identical .    apart from that , the main part of our discussion is in the cluster picture , following @xcite .",
    "we recall the relevant definitions in section  [ sec : cluster ] .",
    "the cluster configurations contributing to @xmath27 turn out to be those in which @xmath30 clusters are non - contractible with respect to the periodic lattice direction .",
    "we henceforth refer to such clusters as _ non - trivial clusters _ , or ntc for brevity . in section  [ sec : ntc ]",
    "we give the character decomposition of constrained partition functions @xmath31 in which the number of ntc is precisely @xmath5 .",
    "this gives as a by - product the character decomposition of the full partition function @xmath13 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain in section  [ sec : fixed ] the character decomposition of a partition function with _ fixed _ ( rather than free ) transverse boundary conditions .",
    "the physical implications of our results are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the cluster representation of the potts model is defined by eq .",
    "( [ zcluster ] ) . since the clusters are non - local objects , it is not a priori obvious how to build the partition function using a transfer matrix .",
    "the key to tackle the problem of non - locality is to introduce a basis of states that takes into account connectivity information @xcite .",
    "however , the periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction introduces a further complication , whose resolution necessitates to introduce a transfer matrix that acts between _ two _ time slices @xcite .",
    "( left part ) and the corresponding connectivity state involving two time slices ( middle part ) .",
    "the points in the right ( resp .  left ) time slice are represented as white ( resp .",
    "black ) circles and are labelled @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) .",
    "the corresponding partition is @xmath34 .",
    "there are two bridges , i.e. , independent connections between the left and right time slices . with the number of bridges given ,",
    "the transfer matrix elements are independent of the connectivity information on the left time slice .",
    "this fact can be expressed graphically by assigning to each bridge an unlabelled black point and depicting the right time slice only ( right part of the figure ) . ]",
    "we therefore begin by reviewing how to write the transfer matrix @xmath26 in the cluster representation when the boundary conditions are cyclic @xcite .",
    "the relevant geometry is shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .. ] unlike the case of free boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction , one must take care not only of the connectivities inside the right time slice ( at time @xmath35 ) , i.e. , between the points labelled @xmath36 , but also of the connectivities of the left time slice ( at time @xmath37 ) , i.e. , between the points @xmath38 , and of the connectivities linking the two time slices .",
    "the transfer matrix propagates the right time slice from time @xmath39 to time @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the space on which the transfer matrix acts is the space of connectivity patterns @xmath41 associated to partitions of the set @xmath42 .",
    "because of the planarity of the lattice only non - crossing partitions are allowed .",
    "an example of an allowed partition and its graphical representation is shown in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    a formal expression of the transfer matrix is given in @xcite .",
    "here we just give the practical rules to calculate its elements . as in the case of free longitudinal boundary conditions , there is a weight @xmath43 per coloured link and a weight @xmath6 per cluster [ see eq .",
    "( [ zcluster ] ) ] , except for the clusters containing a black circle which have a weight equal to @xmath44 . of particular interest",
    "are the components of a partition that contain both white and black circles .",
    "such components are called bridges ; we denote by @xmath45 the total number of bridges in the partition ( in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath46 ) .",
    "when at a time @xmath47 , i.e. , after applying @xmath47 times the transfer matrix , one obtains a state with @xmath45 bridges , it means that there are @xmath45 clusters which begin at @xmath37 and end at a time @xmath48 . note that the initial connectivity ( at @xmath37 ) is the unique state with @xmath1 bridges , meaning that the left and right time slices coincide . denoting this state @xmath49 , the partition function @xmath13 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 takes into account the periodic longitudinal boundary conditions , by re - identifying the left and right time slices at time @xmath52 and assigning a weight @xmath6 to each of the resulting clusters @xcite .",
    "two important observations must be made :    1 .",
    "@xmath26 propagates the right time slice , and so , can not modify the connectivity inside the left time slice .",
    "2 .   under the action of @xmath26 , the number of bridges @xmath45 can only decrease or stay constant .",
    "these two properties imply that the transfer matrix has a lower - triangular block form : @xmath53 furthermore , they also imply that each block @xmath54 on the diagonal of @xmath26 has itself a diagonal block form : @xmath55 each sub - block @xmath56 is characterized by a certain left slice connectivity and a position of the @xmath45 bridges .",
    "its dimension is given by the number of compatible right slice connectivities .",
    "in fact , the @xmath57 sub - blocks @xmath56 , with @xmath58 , are exactly equal , as the rules for computing their matrix elements coincide .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 white circles of the right slice do not `` see '' the left slice connectivity and from where the @xmath45 bridges emanate ; only the number @xmath45 of bridges matters .",
    "in particular , the dimension @xmath59 of the sub - block @xmath60 is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , because of the symmetry between the left and right time slices , the number of sub - blocks equals their dimension , @xmath61 . it can be proved that @xcite : @xmath62 note that @xmath63 , the @xmath1th catalan number , which is the dimension of the cluster transfer matrix with _",
    "free _ longitudinal boundary conditions . indeed , each sub - block @xmath64 is equal to the usual single time slice cluster transfer matrix @xcite . ) , so the connectivities between neighbouring points were forbidden , and therefore the dimension of each sub - block was smaller than @xmath65 given by eq .",
    "( [ defn ] ) . furthermore , in the case of a square lattice , the authors symmetrized @xmath26 with respect to a top - bottom reflection of the strip .",
    "this not only diminishes the total dimension of the transfer matrix , but also the number of sub - blocks . at the same time it makes the structure of @xmath26 slightly more complicated",
    "indeed , there would then be two types of sub - blocks , depending on whether the left slice connectivity and the position of the @xmath45 bridges are symmetric or non - symmetric with respect to the reflection .",
    "the symmetrization couples either pairs of non - symmetric sub - blocks , or pairs of states inside a symmetric sub - block .",
    "therefore , the symmetric and non - symmetric sub - blocks have different dimensions , the non - symmetric sub - blocks having the largest dimension @xmath59 . ]    because of the block structure of @xmath26 , its eigenvalues are the union of the eigenvalues of the sub - blocks @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the sub - blocks with given @xmath45 being equal , one can obtain all the eigenvalues of @xmath26 by considering only one reference sub - block for each given number of bridges @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for instance , one can choose as reference sub - block the one with no connection between black circles and with @xmath45 bridges beginning at @xmath66 .",
    "alternatively , one may forget the labelling of the left time slice altogether , and simply mark by a black point each of the components of the right - slice connectivity which form part of a bridge .",
    "this latter choice is represented in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the following ,",
    "we denote the reference sub - block simply @xmath67 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ defz ] ) and the preceding discussion that @xmath68^n \\,,\\ ] ] where a priori the amplitudes @xmath69 of the eigenvalues @xmath70 ( @xmath71 labels the distinct eigenvalues within the sub - block @xmath67 ) depend of the width @xmath1 , the number of bridges @xmath45 , the label @xmath71 , and the temperature @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , it has been proved in @xcite , and used in @xcite , that @xmath69 depend only of @xmath45 ( and the value of @xmath6 chosen ) .",
    "we therefore denote them @xmath72 in the following .",
    "thus , @xmath73 where the @xmath74 are defined as @xmath75^n \\ , .",
    "\\label{defk}\\ ] ] @xmath27 is thus simply equal to @xmath76 .",
    "the notation @xmath27 ( instead of just @xmath77 ) is motivated by the fact that at the ferromagnetic critical point ( @xmath78 for the square lattice ) , and in the continuum limit , these quantities become special cases of a generic character @xmath79 of conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the character @xmath79 corresponds to the holomorphic dimension @xmath80 of the cft with central charge @xmath81 . for generic ( irrational ) values of @xmath82",
    "this cft is non - unitary and non - minimal .",
    "we shall comment on the case of @xmath82 integer later , in section  [ sec : p_integer ] .",
    "we stress that we have here defined @xmath27 combinatorially for an @xmath0 system , at any temperature @xmath24 , with no continuum limit being taken ; we shall nevertheless refer to them as characters .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath72 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqfond ] ) are @xmath83-deformed numbers @xcite @xmath84 note that @xmath72 is a polynomial of degree @xmath45 in q. in the next section , we obtain a new proof of eq .",
    "( [ defc ] ) , as a by - product of a more general result in which we give a combinatorial sense to each term in the polynomial separately .    in the remainder of the article",
    ", we shall decompose various partition functions as linear combinations of the characters @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath27 are simply related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and can be considered as the basis building blocks of various restricted partition functions .",
    "we now show that the @xmath27 , that we have defined above following @xcite , coincide with the partial traces defined in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "chang and shrock considered the potts model partition function in the spin representation : writing @xmath85 they decomposed the spin space as a direct sum of what they called level @xmath45 subspaces . by definition",
    ", the level @xmath45 subspace corresponds to the space generated by applying @xmath86 to the sum of spin states with @xmath45 spins fixed to @xmath45 given values .",
    "the restriction of @xmath86 to the level @xmath45 subspace is exactly equal to our matrix @xmath87 ( with @xmath45 connectivity components marked by black points ) , as they have the same calculation rules ( marking a cluster with a black point corresponds to fixing its spin state , i.e. , to giving it a weight @xmath44 instead of @xmath6 ) and a very similar graphical representation of the states ( resembling the right part of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the character @xmath27 appears therefore in @xcite as the restriction of the trace to the level @xmath45 subspace .",
    "we remark that the physical interpretation of the amplitudes @xmath72 made in @xcite is somewhat different from ours . indeed",
    ", at level @xmath45 chang and shrock considered all the independent possibilities of attributing values to @xmath45 fixed spins , taking into account that some of those possibilities were already present at lower levels .",
    "accordingly , they interpreted @xmath72 as the number of level @xmath45 states independent among themselves , and independent of states at lower levels , and computed @xmath72 diagramatically .",
    "proving the equivalence of our @xmath27 with those of pasquier and saleur requires some further background material , and is deferred to section  [ sec : eqps ] .",
    "in this section we study the character decomposition of constrained partition functions @xmath31 in which the number of non - trivial clusters ( ntc ) is fixed to @xmath5 , for @xmath88 .",
    "it is important to notice that this is different from the characters @xmath27 , which are related to blocks of the transfer matrix with @xmath45 bridges .",
    "will from now on always denote the number of ntc in @xmath31 , and @xmath45 will denote the number of bridges in @xmath27 . ]",
    "when imposing the periodic longitudinal boundary conditions , each bridge becomes essentially a _ marked _ ntc .",
    "since @xmath27 may contain further ntc which are not marked , we expect @xmath27 to be a linear combination of several @xmath31 with @xmath30 .",
    "conversely , since upon acting with the transfer matrix the number of bridges can only decrease or stay constant , we also expect @xmath31 to be a linear combination of several @xmath27 with @xmath89 .    the primary goal of this section is to obtain the character decomposition of @xmath31 . in the following two subsections",
    "we therefore first express the @xmath27 in terms of the @xmath31 , and then invert the resulting relations .      recalling that @xmath90 , we can write @xmath91 where the @xmath92 are the @xmath59 possible connectivity states with @xmath45 bridges , i.e. , states such as those shown in the right part of fig .  [ fig1 ] with @xmath45 black points .",
    "we first show that a given cluster configuration with @xmath5 ntc is contained @xmath93 times in @xmath27 . to this end",
    ", we define that a connectivity state @xmath92 is _ compatible _ with a given cluster configuration if the action of the cluster configuration on @xmath92 ( in the sense of a transfer matrix acting towards the right ) yields the same connectivity @xmath92 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "it is useful to `` forget '' for a moment that the longitudial boundary conditions are cyclic , i.e. , to consider the leftmost and rightmost columns of the lattice as distinct .",
    "indeed , the periodic boundary conditions are already encoded in the fact that the final and initial states in eq .",
    "( [ exprtr ] ) must coincide .",
    "the goal is then to show that any cluster configuration with @xmath5 ntc is compatible with precisely @xmath93 different connectivity states .",
    "points on the rightmost column of the lattice are interconnected and marked by black points through the cluster configuration _ and _ the connectivity state on the left ) is equal to the initial connectivity state . ]",
    "consider then a given cluster configuration with @xmath5 ntc , with the @xmath94th ntc ( @xmath95 ) connecting onto the points @xmath96 of the rightmost column .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the connectivity states @xmath92 compatible with the cluster configuration can be constructed as follows :    1 .",
    "the connectivities of the points @xmath99 must be connected in the same way in @xmath92 as in the cluster configuration .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the points @xmath100 must be connected .",
    "2 .   the points @xmath96 within the same bridge ( for example , @xmath101 in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) must be connected in @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   one can independently choose to associate or not a black point to each of the sets @xmath96 .",
    "one is free to connect or not two distinct sets @xmath96 and @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , the rules 1 and 2 leave no choice .",
    "the rule 3 implies in particular that @xmath30 , or else there is no compatible state @xmath92 .",
    "the choices mentioned in rule 3 then leave us @xmath93 possibilities for constructing a compatible @xmath92 .",
    "we have therefore shown that a given cluster configuration with @xmath5 ntc is contained @xmath93 times in @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath27 is simply a trace , each of its ntc carries a weight of 1 , whereas the @xmath5 ntc in @xmath31 each have the usual cluster weight of @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore arrive at the result @xmath103 where we recall that @xmath93 has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ defn ] ) .",
    "inverting the relations ( [ exprk ] ) yields @xmath104 with the coefficients @xmath105 given by @xmath106 an interesting special case , which we will refer to in the following , is obtained for @xmath107 , i.e. , by disallowing any ntc . from eqs .",
    "( [ exprz])([defg ] ) , we obtain an alternating sum of the @xmath27 : @xmath108 note also that the total partition function of the potts model is given by @xmath109 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ defg ] ) and ( [ defc ] ) we infer that @xmath110 and from eqs .",
    "( [ exprz ] ) and ( [ zsum ] ) we obtain as promised eq .",
    "( [ eqfond ] ) for the full partition function .",
    "interestingly , then , the effect of fixing the number of ntc to @xmath5 is to keep only the term multiplying @xmath111 in the expression ( [ defc ] ) of @xmath72 .",
    "as @xmath72 is polynomial of degree @xmath45 in @xmath6 , only the @xmath27 with @xmath112 contribute to the character decomposition of @xmath31 .",
    "this is in agreement with the physical argument given at the beginning of section  [ sec : ntc ] .",
    "we can now prove that the @xmath27 defined in @xcite using the six - vertex model are equal to the @xmath27 we defined in eq .",
    "( [ defk ] ) using the cluster transfer matrix . before attacking the proof , let us briefly recall where the connection with the six - vertex model comes from .    on a planar lattice ,",
    "the cluster representation of the potts model partition function is equivalent to a loop representation , where the loops are defined on the medial lattice and surround the clusters @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ zcluster ] ) and the euler relation , the weight of a loop configuration @xmath17 is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is its number of loops . , in order to recover exactly the same expression for the @xmath27 as before . ]",
    "an oriented loop representation is obtained by independently assigning an orientation to each loop , with weight @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath115 ) for counterclockwise ( resp . clockwise )",
    "loops ( recall that @xmath116 ) . in this representation one can define the spin @xmath117 along the transfer direction ( with parallel / antiparallel loops contributing @xmath118 ) which acts as a conserved quantum number . note that @xmath119 means that there are at least @xmath45 non - contractible loops , i.e. , loops that wind around the periodic ( @xmath2 ) direction of the lattice .",
    "indeed , the contractible loops do not contribute to @xmath117 .",
    "the weights @xmath120 can be further redistributed locally , as a factor of @xmath121 for a counterclockwise turn through an angle @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "while this redistribution correctly weighs contractible loops , the non - contractible loops are given weight @xmath123 , but this can be corrected @xcite by twisting the model , i.e. , by inserting the operator @xmath124 into the trace that defines the partition function .",
    "a partial resummation over the oriented - loop splittings at vertices which are compatible with a given orientation of the edges incident to that vertex now gives a six - vertex model representation @xcite .",
    "each edge of the medial lattice then carries an arrow , and these arrows are conserved at the vertices : the net arrow flux defines @xmath117 as before .",
    "the six - vertex model again needs twisting by the operator @xmath125 to ensure the correct weighting . considering each arrow as a spin @xmath126 , the transfer matrix in the six - vertex representation , @xmath127 , acts on a quantum chain of @xmath128 spins @xmath126",
    "@xmath127 can be expressed in terms of generators of a temperley - lieb algebra , and therefore commutes with the generators of the quantum group @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "( [ exprk ] ) , from which we shall conclude that the two definitions of @xmath27 are equivalent .    to this end , we first remark that @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the trace of @xmath130 on the space of _ all _ states of spin @xmath119 . indeed , the number of highest weight states of spin @xmath131 equals the number of states of spin @xmath119 minus the number of states of spin @xmath136 .",

    "the contractible loops can have any orientation ( not shown ) , whereas those of the non - contractible loops are constrained by the chosen value of @xmath117 . with @xmath137 non - contractible loops we show one of the four possible orientations leading to @xmath138 . ]",
    "we now consider a configuration of oriented loops contributing to @xmath31 , i.e. , with @xmath139 non - contractible loops .",
    "as the contractible loops do not contribute to @xmath117 , there are no constraints on their orientations . among the @xmath139 non - contractible loops , @xmath140 ( resp .",
    "@xmath141 ) must be oriented to the right ( resp.left ) in order to obtain @xmath119 ( recall that @xmath142 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "there are therefore @xmath143 possible orientations of the non - contractible loops compatible with the chosen value of @xmath117 . correcting for the factors of @xmath6 as before ,",
    "we conclude that the character decomposition of @xmath135 is @xmath144 using now eq .",

    "note that @xmath164 corresponds to fixed boundary conditions on the two exterior dual spins .",
    "the case @xmath165 is equivalent ( under duality ) to the free transverse boundary conditions considered above ; we denote the corresponding dual partition function @xmath166 .",
    "we search the character decomposition of @xmath167 , where the prefactor is chosen so as to make the final result simpler . to achieve this goal",
    ", one needs first to convert the weights of the dual clusters into weights of direct clusters .",
    "indeed , by duality a direct cluster configuration is in one - to - one correspondence with a dual cluster configuration @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . to simplify the notation",
    ", we adopt the following convention : a dual cluster is called a _ non - trivial cluster _ ( ntc ) if it is non - contractible with respect to the periodic lattice direction , or if it contains one ( or both ) of the exterior dual spins . with this convention , a dual configuration with @xmath168",
    "dual ntc corresponds always to a direct configuration with @xmath5 direct ntc .",
    "note that there is always at least one dual ntc .    .",
    "direct ( resp .",
    "dual ) vertices are shown as black circles ( resp .",
    "red squares ) .",
    "there are two direct ntc and three dual ntc ( see text ) . ]    given a cluster configuration , we denote by @xmath47 the number of direct trivial ( contractible ) clusters , by @xmath169 the number of dual trivial clusters , by @xmath170 the number of direct edges , and by @xmath171 the number of dual edges .",
    "consider now the weight of a configuration with @xmath168 dual ntc in @xmath167 .",
    "for @xmath172 ( resp .",
    "@xmath107 ) this is @xmath173 ( resp .",
    "@xmath174 ) , since the two exterior dual vertices are contained in two different ( resp .",
    "the same ) dual ntc .",
    "we have here denoted the dual parameter @xmath175 .    to express these weights in terms of the direct quantities , we recall the fundamental duality relation @xcite @xmath176 , valid because the lattice is planar .",
    "translated into a relation on the weights of a single cluster configuration this reads @xmath177 therefore , the weight of a cluster configuration with @xmath5 direct ntc reads @xmath178 if @xmath179 , and @xmath180 if @xmath107 .",
    "we thus deduce the following result : the weight of a direct cluster configuration in @xmath181 is the same as in @xmath182 , except that for @xmath172 direct ntc , one of the ntc has a weight @xmath163 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "let us recall that when inserting the development ( [ defc ] ) of @xmath72 into eq .",
    "( [ eqfond ] ) for @xmath13 , we have a geometrical interpretation for each term separately : from eq .",
    "( [ exprz ] ) the term in @xmath111 gives precisely @xmath31 .",
    "due to the result given after eq .",
    "( [ dual ] ) , we must now simply replace @xmath183 by @xmath184 for @xmath179 and keep unchanged the term corresponding to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore @xmath185 with the amplitudes @xmath186 note that when @xmath165 , we recover @xmath187 as we should .",
    "just like in the case of free transverse boundary conditions , each power of @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ exprzdu ] ) can be interpreted separately as a partition function with a fixed number of ntc .",
    "let us consider a couple of limiting cases of eq .",
    "( [ exprzdu ] ) . for @xmath188 , @xmath189 and",
    "therefore @xmath190 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ exprz1 ] ) .",
    "we thus recover exactly the partition function with no direct ntc .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath191 , there is no @xmath192 in the expansion of @xmath181 , i.e. , @xmath193 is forbidden .",
    "this is indeed expected , since in that limit there can be no dual cluster connecting the two exterior vertices , and therefore there is at least one direct ntc .",
    "thus @xmath107 is forbidden , and since @xmath112 , we deduce that @xmath193 is forbidden as well .",
    "we now consider the case of @xmath82 integer .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ defb ] ) and ( [ symc ] ) , we obtain that for @xmath82 even @xmath194 and we can write @xmath195 note finally that @xmath196 . this means that with fixed cyclic boundary conditions ( @xmath164 ) the term @xmath197 drops out from the character decomposition .",
    "this fact has been exploited in a recent study of partition function zeroes of the rsos models @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath164 can be interpreted in the spin representation as having the same fixed value of the dual spins on the two exterior dual vertices .",
    "alternatively , in the cluster picture , a dual cluster containing one or both exterior vertices has the weight @xmath44 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "suppose now for simplicity that the direct lattice is a square lattice .",
    "the dual lattice is then a square lattice too , except for the two exterior vertices , each of which is equivalent to an extra line of spins all fixed in the same state . to make the equivalence perfect",
    "we should include an extra global factor of @xmath198 , because of the interactions between spins inside each of the two extra lines ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the dual lattice is thus equivalent to a square lattice of width @xmath199 and of length @xmath2 , with periodic boundary conditions along @xmath2 and all the spins at the boundaries fixed to the same value .",
    "we denote the corresponding partition function @xmath200 .",
    "( [ exprzdu ] ) then reads explicitly @xmath201 let us write out the explicit results for integer @xmath6 . for the ising model ( @xmath202 or @xmath203 )",
    "we have @xmath204 while for the three - state potts model ( @xmath205 or @xmath206 ) we find @xmath207 in the latter case , it is interesting to note that at the ferromagnetic critical point @xmath208 is nothing but the character of the identity operator with respect to the extended @xmath209 algebra @xcite .",
    "we have explained in this paper how to decompose various constrained partition functions of the potts model with cyclic boundary conditions in terms of the characters @xmath27 .",
    "these decompositions , whose origin is purely combinatorial , hold true in finite size , for any weakly regular lattice , and at any temperature @xmath24 .",
    "in particular we can decompose the ratios @xmath210 , which are the probabilities of having exactly @xmath5 non - trivial clusters .",
    "while these probabilities are well - understood in the continuum limit , at the ferromagnetic critical point at least , our results shed more light on their fine structure , in particular regarding corrections to scaling .",
    "finally , we have seen that fixed transverse boundary conditions lead to the disappearance of the term with @xmath197 .",
    "physically , one would expect the breaking of the @xmath211 permutation symmetry of the spin states induced by the fixed boundary conditions to simplify the structure of the complex - temperature phase diagram in the low - temperature phase .",
    "this expectation is indeed brought out in a recent numerical study @xcite ."
