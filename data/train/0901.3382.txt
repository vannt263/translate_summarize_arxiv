    "ultra - cool dwarfs , low - mass objects of low temperature extending beyond the classical main sequence , have been identified in significant numbers from recent large optical and near infrared surveys , such as the deep near infrared survey @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , and the two micron all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "two new spectral type ( l , t ) have been added to classify those extremely cool objects , and these are now widely in use , with several hundred l and t dwarfs classified to date @xcite .",
    "most stars classified as l and t dwarfs are relatively metal - rich , and associated with the galactic disk population .",
    "one also expects the solar neighborhood to be host to ultra - cool members of the galactic halo ( population ii ) .",
    "however pop ii stars are rare in the vicinity of the sun , where they account for roughly one out of every 200 stars .",
    "conversely , one expects ultracool _ subdwarfs _ ( sdl , sdt ) to be equally rare . in any case , old metal - poor stars and brown dwarfs are expected to display a distinct spectral signature , making their identification straightforward . in stars of spectral type m",
    ", metal depletion is known to result in a weakening of metal oxide bands , usually prominent in m stars @xcite .",
    "m subdwarfs are thus organized following distinct classification sequences as subdwarfs ( sdm ) , extreme subdwarfs ( esdm ) , and ultrasubdwarfs ( usdm ) , depending of the magnitude of metal - depletion effects in their spectra @xcite .",
    "note that spectroscopically confirmed m subdwarfs number only in the hundreds @xcite , compared with the tens of thousands of stars now classified as m dwarfs .",
    "very few subdwarfs of spectral subtype sdm7 or later ( `` ultra - cool subdwarfs '' ) have been identified to date .",
    "most have been discovered in follow - up spectroscopic surveys of faint stars with very large proper motions @xcite , others from the massive sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic database @xcite . extending the m subdwarf sequence to subtypes later than sdm7/esdm7/usdm7 has been straightforward as the metal - poor stars display the same weakening of the tio bands as document for earlier subtypes .",
    "more challenging has been the identification of metal - poor stars beyond the spectral type m , in the range of surface temperature characteristic of the l and t stars , and designated as l and t subdwarfs ( sdl , sdt ) .    the first star to be unambiguously identification as a subdwarf",
    "spectral type l is 2mass 0532 + 8246 @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum had mixed spectral features corresponding to early and late l spectral types .",
    "the nir spectrum have strong collision induced absorption ( cia ) due to molecules , giving a blue color similar to a t dwarf .",
    "another star with similar features ( 2mass  1626 + 3925 ) was discovered by @xcite and also tentatively classified as sdl . a third object ,",
    "the star lhs  1610 - 0040 , was initially claimed to be an early - type subdwarf @xcite , but further analysis has failed to substantiate the claim @xcite ; the star is now believed to be a peculiar late - type dwarf , possibly displaying anomalous metal abundances @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of another object with spectral characteristic consistent with a metal - poor `` l subdwarf '' .",
    "the star was identified from the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic database , and is found to be significantly cooler than all known m subdwarfs , but warmer than 2mass  0532 + 8246 and 2mass  1626 + 3925 . we examine the spectral characteristics and kinematics of the star .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey obtains spectra from a variety of objects based on various color and magnitude selection cuts @xcite .",
    "the survey is not complete in most of the star categories , as a limited number of fibers ( 640 ) are used in each of the sdss fields , and stellar targets are assigned only after the primary categories ( qsos , galaxies ) .",
    "the spectra cover the full 3300-9500  wavelength range , which includes the main molecular features used to identify cool dwarfs and subdwarfs .    the sdss second data release ( dr2 ) listed 13,379 spectra of sources identified as cool and ultra - cool stars ( spectral subtype m and later ) .",
    "the dr2 covered a total survey area of 2627 square degrees or a little over 6.5% of the sky . in an attempt to detect ultra - cool l subdwarfs from this sample",
    ", we have systematically examined the spectra form all stellar sources with very red optical - to - infrared color .",
    "first , we identified all possible counterparts to the 13,379 late - type stars in the 2mass all - sky catalog of point source @xcite .",
    "then we assembled spectra of all the stars with magnitude @xmath318 and color @xmath46.0 , which eliminating from the sample most objects with spectral subtypes m6 or earlier .",
    "we visually inspected all the spectra in search of any star with a peculiar spectral energy distribution .",
    "all spectra were found to be consistent with either late - type m dwarfs or l dwarfs , except for only one which clearly stood out from the group : the spectrum of the star .",
    "sloan photometry shows to be very faint in the optical , but it has relatively bright counterparts in both the 2mass and denis infrared catalogs ; the object is clearly very red .",
    "it is undetected in the digital sky survey blue ( iiiaj ) and red plates ( iiiaf ) , but has a counterpart on the infrared ( ivn ) plates  and is thus registered in the supercosmos sky archive ( ssa ) .",
    "data on this unusual object are recorded in table 1 .",
    "the very red spectrum of is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the star shows many spectral features typical of late - m and l dwarfs , which confirms that it is a very cool object and not a background star affected by reddening . the dominant feature is a deep k",
    "i doublet at 7700 , with strong pressure broadened wings , similar to what is observed in mid - type l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the spectrum also displays strong bands of crh and feh at 8600  and atomic lines of rbi , all typically observed in l dwarfs . paradoxically , also displays well - defined bands of cah and tio around 7050 , which are usually observed in m dwarfs and are normally absent in subtypes later than m9 , due to the condensation of oxides into dust grains .",
    "indeed redward of 7500  the spectrum is strongly reminiscent of a late - type m dwarf .",
    "overall , the spectrum does not fit within the standard m / l dwarf classification scheme @xcite , and appears to be a hybrid of m - type and l - type spectral features .",
    "however , the spectrum is strikingly similar to the optical spectrum of the `` sdl '' star 2mass  1626 + 3925 @xcite , with prominent bands of tio and cah redward of 7500  in what looks in all other respect like an l dwarf .",
    "the lingering presence of tio bands in those ultra - cool objects is interpreted as the signature of a metal - poor atmosphere in which dust formation is inefficient , and which maintains metal oxides in gaseous form even at very low temperature .",
    "in any case , is too cool to be classified an m subdwarf . with @xmath5 , is significantly redder in the optical than the coolest known m subdwarfs @xcite . but again paradoxically , the optical - to - infrared colors are significantly bluer than in field l dwarfs , and the @xmath6 is more in line with subtype m6-m7 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the infrared colors of are unusual : with @xmath70.66 , is significantly bluer that any known field l dwarfs , which all have @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the same blue @xmath9 color is observed in the l subdwarf 2mass  0532 + 82 @xcite , which further suggest they are of a similar class . in 2mass  0532@xmath1082 the blue ir color is found to be due to a strong collision induced absorption ( cia ) band from . such unusually strong cia",
    "is also suggested to be a consequence of low - metallicity @xcite , and results in a significant redistribution of the flux in the optical .",
    "all in all , the photometry of also supports the idea that it a metal - depleted , ultra - cool dwarf .",
