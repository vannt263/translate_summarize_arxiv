    "the classical limit of quantum mechanics is continuously an interesting research topic @xcite .",
    "it is often considered that @xmath0 gives the classical limit .",
    "other limits that are very often used are large quantum numbers ( correspondence principle ) , short de broglie wavelengths and large masses .",
    "it has been argued that the limit @xmath0 is conceptually and mathematically problematic .",
    "in addition , different possible limiting procedures that can be used in a given problem are mathematically inequivalent @xcite . very recently",
    ", a dividing line between quantum and classical trajectories in the continuous measurement process has been proposed leading to the so - called bohmian time constant @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the wave function @xmath1 provides statistical knowledge of the state of a system .",
    "the classical analog of this system corresponds to an ensemble of particles following deterministic trajectories .",
    "thus , comparison of classical and quantum mechanics should be meaningful provided that their statistical predictions for the dynamical evolutions of the same given initial ensemble is used , apart from some version of the correspondence principle .",
    "quantum mechanics is formulated in hilbert space while classical statistical mechanics is formulated in phase space .",
    "thus , the corresponding evolution equations are the schrdinger and liouville equations , respectively . according to feynman in his dynamical theory of the josephson effect @xcite",
    ", classical and quantum mechanics may be embedded in the same hamiltonian formulation by using complex canonical coordinates @xcite .",
    "based on heslot s work @xcite , a theory of quantum - classical hybrid dynamics has been proposed @xcite , which concerns the direct coupling of classical and quantum mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "application of this proposal to entanglement dynamics and mirror - induced decoherence has been studied @xcite .    for a given system ,",
    "the initial phase space distribution of an ensemble is not uniquely defined .",
    "the simplest choice is to take a product of the position and momentum distributions .",
    "based on this scheme , the quantum - classical correspondence of an arrival time distribution has been considered in terms of a non - minimum - uncertainty - product gaussian wave packet ( known as a squeezed state ) which evolves in the presence of a linear potential @xcite . in particular , it was shown by riahi @xcite that , if the compared initial distribution functions are gaussian with identical statistical properties , the quantum and the classical mean arrival times are the same under the influence of at most quadratic potentials . moreover , for potentials of the form @xmath2 , the liouville equation for the classical phase space distribution function coincides with the evolution equation for the wigner function @xcite .",
    "so , if both functions coincide initially , they will coincide all the time in such a potential .",
    "@xcite have taken the initial classical phase space distribution as the product of the position and the momentum distributions , and this is the point which has been criticized by riahi .",
    "this author , in contrast , considers the initial phase space distribution function to be the wigner function that is evaluated using the given initial wave function . in their reply , home _ et al . _",
    "state that it is not desirable to use any quantum input to fix the initial conditions for classical calculations when one considers classical limit of quantum mechanics .",
    "an alternative route which has been less used in literature , it is that initially proposed by rosen @xcite .",
    "he argues that , in the large mass limit , the schrdinger equation should be replaced by another schrdinger - like equation , known as classical wave equation , which is equivalent to the classical continuity and hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "he , by speculation , conjectured that transition from quantum domain to the classical one takes place for masses of the order of @xmath3 g or larger .",
    "this classical wave equation contains a non - linear term in @xmath1 which in general prevents superposition of different states unless these states do not overlap or can be expressed as a multiplication of each other .",
    "thus , instead of superposition , pure states are combined to produce mixed states @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the scattering of a wave packet by a barrier , if the the energy is less than the barrier height , the solutions of the classical wave equation , that is , the incident and reflected functions describe independent motions , without no interference effects . on the contrary , in the corresponding quantum problem",
    ", the quantum pure state remains pure and there is no classical limit @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to examine the quantum - classical correspondence by analyzing the dynamics of a wave packet with different barrier parameters and masses in terms of mean arrival times .",
    "the detector location is situated well behind the barrier to prevent some overlapping .",
    "we would like to provide a criterion for the magnitude of mass for which the classical wave equation of rosen should be used instead of the schrdinger equation .",
    "then we consider a two - body system and discuss about the possibility of generalization of rosen s classical wave equation .",
    "although particles are non - interacting , due to the symmetry of the total wave function spatial correlations exist . by deriving one - body distributions , we study differences between fermions and bosons .",
    "consider a beam of incident particles from the left by a rectangular potential barrier defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the step function and @xmath6 is the corresponding width .",
    "an ideal detector placed at @xmath7 , very far from the barrier , can detect transmitted particles at a given time .",
    "the initial wave function is assumed to be of the form @xmath8 in the region @xmath9 , which is a plane wave modulated by the variable amplitude @xmath10 and with initial momentum @xmath11 . the corresponding initial , classical phase space distribution function is @xmath12    this initial wave function describes _ classically _ a set of particles having the same momentum @xmath11 . _",
    "quantum mechanically _ a momentum distribution is usually assumed .",
    "when the incident energy is greater than the barrier height , that is , @xmath13 , classically , all particles of mass @xmath14 ultimately cross the barrier and arrive at the detector location , @xmath15 .",
    "however , quantum mechanically , the particles can also be reflected by the barrier . due to the fact the detector is located very far from the barrier",
    ", then it suffices to consider only the transmitted part of the initial wave packet .",
    "once an incident particle coming from the left of the barrier has passed completely through it , the transmitted part of the wave packet is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the fourier transform of the initial wave function and @xmath19 is the transmission probability amplitude for monochromatic incidence with @xmath20 .",

    "furthermore , one can easily _ prove _ that its distribution is given by ( [ eq : ar_timdis ] ) .",
    "on the contrary , in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , this concept is rather controversial and there are different _ proposals _ for its definition ( see , for example , ref .",
