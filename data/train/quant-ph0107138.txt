    "characterization and control of thermal noise is of particular interest for very sensitive measurements such as interferometric gravitational - wave detectors@xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the mirror position result from the thermal excitation of various mechanical modes of the suspended mirrors , corresponding either to external degrees of freedom of the suspension system or to acoustic modes of the mirror substrate .",
    "this leads to undesirable displacements of the mirrors and limits the sensitivity of the measurement .",
    "for example internal thermal noise is due to deformations of the mirror surface and constitutes the main limitation of gravitational - wave detectors in the intermediate frequency domain .",
    "thermal fluctuations are associated with dissipation mechanisms inherent in the system@xcite and are therefore very difficult to avoid .",
    "apart from passive methods such as the modification of mechanical damping@xcite or cryogenic methods to lower the temperature@xcite , these thermal fluctuations may be reduced by using active systems . in particular",
    "it has been proposed to use an optomechanical displacement sensor to monitor the brownian motion of a mirror @xcite .",
    "cold damping techniques have also been studied to reduce the effective temperature of a system well below the operating temperature@xcite .",
    "they have been proposed to reduce the brownian motion of an electrometer@xcite and used to achieve very high sensitivity in accelerometers developped for fundamental physics applications in space@xcite .",
    "such techniques have been successfully applied to an optomechanical system composed of a high - finesse cavity and a feedback loop@xcite .",
    "the displacement of the mirror is measured by the optical fabry - perot cavity with a very high sensitivity@xcite .",
    "this information is fed back to the mirror via the radiation pressure of an intensity - modulated laser beam . for an appropriate design of the feedback loop ,",
    "the radiation pressure exerted on the mirror is proportional to the mirror velocity .",
    "the servo - control force then corresponds to a viscous force .",
    "in contrast to passive damping which is necessarily accompanied by thermodynamic fluctuations@xcite , this active damping does not add any thermal noise and allows to greatly reduce the brownian motion of the mirror .",
    "power noise reductions around the mechanical resonance frequency of the mirror as large as 1000 have been experimentally obtained . as proposed in @xcite such short cavities could in principle",
    "be used to monitor the mirrors of a gravitational - wave interferometer .",
    "they would be insensitive to a gravitational wave and allow to reduce the mirrors thermal noise without affecting the response of the interferometer to the gravitational signal .    in the experimental conditions of references@xcite , quantum effects are negligible as compared to thermal noise so that a classical treatment of the system is satisfactory to fit the experimental results .",
    "the analysis of electromechanical devices has provided precise discussions of the classical limits of cold damping@xcite .",

    "reduction of quantum noise of light has also motivated studies on the behaviour of quantum noise in presence of active feedback@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this technique allows to eliminate back action in quantum measurements@xcite or to reduce quantum fluctuations of a light beam inside a feedback loop below the standard quantum limit , allowing an increased sensitivity of measurements @xcite .    with the optomechanical system , it is possible to reduce the initial temperature of the mirror and to improve the experimental efficiency of the cooling .",
    "this opens the way to a quantum regime of cold damping and raises several questions . for passive systems , in the limit of a null temperature , thermodynamic fluctuations associated with dissipation reproduce the quantum fluctuations required by heisenberg inequalities@xcite .",
    "what happens to the fluctuations of an actively cooled system ?",
    "does cold damping allow to reduce quantum fluctuations as it does with classical fluctuations ?",
    "is there a temperature limit for this technique ?",
    "do the quantum fluctuations of light introduce a limit in the efficiency of the cooling process ?",
    "how is it possible to reach the limits ?    in this paper , we address these questions by a quantum analysis of cold damping with optomechanical coupling .",
    "we use a theoretical treatment based on quantum networks theory@xcite .",
    "this approach allows to treat in the same framework both thermal and quantum fluctuations , for passive as well as for active elements@xcite .",
    "this quantum description ensure the consistency of the approach and allows to study the effect of cold damping for very low initial temperature .",
    "it has for example been proven fruitful in the analysis of quantum limits for ultrasensitive measurements with cold damped capacitive accelerometers@xcite .",
    "we show that the only limit of cold damping are zero - point quantum mechanical fluctuations of the mirror , in agreement with general thermodynamical relations and heisenberg inequalities@xcite .",

    "the sensitivity of the measurement by the high - finesse cavity , and quantum fluctuations of radiation pressure disturb the mirror motion . in contrast with interferometers ,",
    "however , radiation pressure effects are controlled by the active feedback .",
    "it is then possible to reduce the mirror fluctuations down to the zero - point quantum mechanical fluctuations , by an appropriate optimization of the cold damping mechanism .    in section  [ m_optomechanicaltransducer ]",
    "we present the optomechanical transducer composed of the high - finesse cavity and the feedback loop .",
    "basic relations of cold damping mechanism are derived in section [ m_colddamping ] .    in section [ m_resonance ]",
    "we analyze the quantum limits for the reduction of mirror thermal noise on a narrow frequency band around the mechanical resonance .",
