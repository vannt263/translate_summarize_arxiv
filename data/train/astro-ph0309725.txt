    "an unusual class of compact sources  ultraluminous x - ray sources , has been discovered in nearby galaxies more than a decade ago @xcite .",
    "although bright , @xmath5 erg / s , point - like sources are found both in young star forming galaxies and in old stellar population of elliptical galaxies , the most luminous and exotic objects are associated with actively starforming galaxies .",
    "their nature and relation to more ordinary x - ray binaries is still a matter of a significant debate .",
    "based on a simple eddington luminosity argument , they appear to be powered by accretion onto an intermediate mass object  a black hole with the mass in the hundreds - thousands solar masses range .",
    "however , a number of alternative models have been considered as well  from collimated radiation to @xmath6stellar mass black holes , representing the high mass tail of the standard stellar evolution sequence and accreting in the near- or slightly super - eddington regime .",
    "sub - arcsec angular resolution of chandra observatory opened a new era in studying population of compact sources in nearby galaxies .",
    "for the first time an opportunity was presented to observe compact sources in a nearly confusion free regime and to investigate their relation to fundamental parameters of the host galaxy , such as its stellar mass and star formation rate .",
    "depending on the mass of the optical companion , x - ray binaries are subdivided in to two classes  low and high mass x - ray binaries , having significantly different evolutionary time scale , @xmath7 and @xmath8 years respectively @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission from hmxbs makes them a potentially good tracer of the very recent star formation activity in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the lmxbs , on the other hand , have no relation to the present star formation , but , rather , are related to the stellar content of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "chandra observations of the nearby galaxies present a possibility to verify this simple picture and to calibrate the relation between the hmxb population and the current value of sfr .",
    "this opens a new way to determine the star formation rate in relatively closeby galaxies as well as in young and very distant ones .",
    "detailed study of the population of the compact sources in star forming galaxies can also shed the light on the mistery of the ulxs .",
    "in order to study the hmxb population and its relation to star formation we selected a number of nearby late type galaxies observed by chandra , based primarily on two criteria .",
    "( i ) the galaxy can be spatially resolved by chandra , so that the contribution of a central agn can be discriminated and the luminosity functions of the compact sources can be constructed without severe confusion effects .",
    "( ii ) the galaxy has sufficiently high sfr / mass ratio , to ensure that the population of x - ray binaries is dominated by hmxbs and the lmxb contribution of can be safely ignored @xcite . for the milky way we explicitly selected hmxbs , based on results of @xcite . for each galaxy ,",
    "the star formation rate was determined combining the results from conventional sfr indicators , @xcite ( fir , uv , h@xmath9 and radio ) .",
    "the sfr values in the sample range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 m@xmath12/yr .",
    "further details and references to the x - ray data are given in @xcite .",
    "the fig.[fig : lfs ] ( left panel ) shows observed luminosity functions .",
    "they are characterized by a large spread in the number of sources and in the luminosity of the brightest source . however , after being rescaled to the same value of the star formation rate , they appear to match each other both in the slope of the distribution and the normalization ( right panel in fig.[fig : lfs ] ) .",
    "although a finite dispersion might still exist , especially at the high luminosity end , the rescaled luminsity functions occupy a rather narrow band in the @xmath13 plane , despite of large dynamical range of the star formation rates , a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "we further combine the data for five nearby starburst galaxies with the best known luminosity functions , having cumulative star fromation rate of @xmath15 m@xmath12/yr , and compare them with the luminosity distributions of two low sfr galaxies , the milky way and smc ( fig.[fig : lf_comb ] ) .",
    "as previously , a good agreement both in the slope and normalization of luminosity distributions is obvious .",
    "the fit to combined data with a power law distribution gives the slope of @xmath16 , a cut - off at @xmath17 erg / s and the normalization proportional to the star formation rate : @xmath18 where sfr is formation rate for massive stars , @xmath19 . within the accuracy of the present analysis ,",
    "this can be regarded as a `` universal '' luminosity function of high mass x - ray binaries in nearby star forming galaxies .",
    "the fig.[fig : lf_comb ] shows the average differential luminosity function of hmxbs obtained using the data of all galaxies from our chandra sample .",
    "as the population of high mass x - ray binaries ( i.e. the normalization of the luminosity function and the number of sources ) is proportional to sfr , eq.([eq : xlfdif ] ) , they can be exploited to measure star formation rate in the host galaxy .",
    "such a method , based on the x - ray emission of a galaxy , might circumvent one the main sources of uncertainty of conventional sfr indicators  absorption by dust and gas @xcite .",
    "indeed , galaxies are mostly transparent to x - rays above @xmath20 kev , except for the densest parts of the most massive molecular clouds .    for nearby , spatially resolved galaxies ,",
    "the star formation rate can be determined via a direct fitting of the luminosity distribution of the compact sources or counting the number of sources above a given luminosity threshold . for distant",
    ", unresolved galaxies one can use the total luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "there are , however , two main complicating factors in using the x - ray luminosity of a galaxy as a sfr indicator : ( i ) x - ray emission from the central supermassive black hole , which even in the case of a low luminosity agn can easily out - shine x - ray binaries .",
    "this does not present a problem in nearby ( @xmath21 mpc ) galaxies as the chandra resolution is sufficient to separate contribution of the central source , but might become an important source of contamination in spatially unresolved galaxies .",
    "( ii ) contribution of low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this equally affects nearby and distant galaxies , as lmxbs can not be easily separated from hmxbs using the x - ray data in the chandra bandpass , and the optical identifications are ( potentially ) available for the most nearby galaxies only .",
    "however , as the lmxb population scales linearly with the stellar mass of the host galaxy @xcite , their contribution can be estimated and , potentially , corrected for .",
    "obviously , at sufficiently high values of sfr/@xmath22 it can be safely neglected , @xcite .    to further calibrate the @xmath4sfr relation and verify its applicability to distant galaxies",
    ", we extended our sample to include the spatially unresolved galaxies observed by asca and bepposax and distant star forming galaxies detected by chandra in the hubble deep field north @xcite ( see @xcite for details and references ) .",
    "as for the galaxies from our spatially resolved chandra sample , star formation rates were determined by the conventional , non x - ray methods .",
    "the combined data are shown in the @xmath4sfr plane in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] .",
    "a seemingly obvious expression for the total luminosity can be obtained integrating the luminosity distribution ( [ eq : xlfdif ] ) : @xmath23 implying , that the total luminosity is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "we note , however , that the quantity of interest is a sum of the luminosities of discrete sources : @xmath24 with @xmath25 obeying a power law probability distribution given by eq.([eq : xlfdif ] ) . for a sufficiently flat slope , @xmath26",
    ", the total luminosity @xmath27 will be defined by the brightest sources , corresponding to the high luminosity end of the power law distribution eq.([eq : xlfdif ] ) .",
    "their actual number in a galaxy will obey the poisson distribution @xmath28 ( with @xmath29sfr ) , which for small values of @xmath30 is significantly asymmetric . as a consequence , for a galaxy with small sfr",
    ", the probability distribution @xmath31 will be also strongly asymmetric , as illustrated by the left panel in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] .",
    "because of its skewness , the mode of the @xmath31 distribution  the value of @xmath27 that would be most likely measured in an arbitrarily chosen galaxy , is not equal to the expectation mean defined by eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) . only in the large sfr limit ,",
    "when there are sufficiently many sources with luminosities @xmath32 , these two quantities become close to each other.const ) or gaussian flux distribution the most probable value of @xmath27 always equals to the expectation mean defined by eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) . ]    the difference between these two quantities is further illustrated in the right panel in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] , showing the predicted @xmath33sfr relation , calculated using the parameters of the `` universal '' hmxb luminosity function , eq.([eq : xlfdif ] ) .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows the sfr  dependence of the mode of the probability distribution @xmath31 and predicts the _ most probable _ value of the x - ray luminosity of a randomly chosen galaxy .",
    "if observations of many ( different ) galaxies with close values of sfr are performed , the obtained values of @xmath27 will obey the probability distribution depicted in the left panel of fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] .",
    "the average of the measured values of @xmath27 will be equal to the expectation mean given by eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) and shown by the dashed straight lines in the left and right panels of fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] . due to the properties of the probability distribution @xmath31 these two quantities are not identical in the low sfr limit , when the total luminosity is defined by a small number of the most luminous sources .",
    "the right panel in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] compares the data with the predicted @xmath4sfr relation .",
    "good agreement , both in the non - linear low sfr regime and at high sfr values is apparent .",
    "the relations between total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy due to hmxbs and the star formation rate are : @xmath34 \\approx \\frac{l_{\\rm 2 - 10~kev}}{6.7\\cdot 10^{39}{\\rm ~erg / s } } \\label{eq : sfr_lx}\\ ] ] in the linear regime and @xmath35 \\approx \\left(\\frac{l_{\\rm 2 - 10~kev}}{2.6\\cdot",
    "10^{39}{\\rm~erg / s}}\\right)^{0.6 } \\label{eq : sfr_lx1}\\ ] ] in the non - linear regime , corresponding to sfr@xmath36 m@xmath12 yr@xmath37 ( @xmath38 erg s@xmath37 ) the former , linear , regime of the @xmath33sfr relation was studied independently by @xcite based on asca and bepposax data .",
    "note that their equation ( 12 ) agrees with our eq.([eq : sfr_lx ] ) within @xmath39 per cent .",
    "due to skewness of the probability distribution @xmath40 , large and asymmetric dispersion around the solid curve in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] is expected in the non - linear low sfr regime .",
    "this asymmetry is already seen from the distribution of the points in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ]  at low sfr values there are more points above the solid curve , than below .",
    "moreover , the galaxies lying significantly above the solid and dashed curves in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] should be expected at low sfr and will inevitably appear as the plot is populated with more objects .",
    "such behavior differs from a typical astrophysical situation and should not be ignored when analyzing and fitting the @xmath33sfr relation in the low sfr regime . in particular , the standard data analysis techniques ",
    "least square and @xmath41 fitting become inadequate .",
    "the existence of the linear regime in the @xmath33sfr relation is a direct consequence of the cut - off in the luminosity function .",
    "the position of the break between non - linear and linear parts of the @xmath33sfr relation depends on the slope of the luminosity function and the value of the cut - off luminosity ( fig.[fig : lx - sfr - break ] ) : @xmath42 .",
    "this allows one to constrain parameters of the luminosity distribution of compact sources using the data of spatially unresolved galaxies .",
    "agreement of the predicted @xmath4sfr relation with the data both in high and low sfr regimes gives an independent confirmation of the existence of a cut - off in the luminosity function of hmxbs at @xmath43 erg / s ( fig.[fig : lx - sfr],[fig : lx - sfr - break ] ) .",
    "it also confirms that @xmath4sfr data , including the high redshift galaxies from hubble deep field north , are consistent with the hmxb luminosity function parameters , derived from significantly fewer galaxies , than plotted in figs.[fig : lx - sfr],[fig : lx - sfr - break ] .",
    "one of the surprising results of this study is a smooth , single slope power law shape of the average luminosity function of compact sources in star forming galaxies , without any significant steps and features in a broad luminosity range , @xmath44 ( fig.[fig : lf_comb ] ) .",
    "the high luminosity end , @xmath45 , of this distribution corresponds to ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
    "its low luminosity end , on the other hand , is composed of ordinary x - ray binaries , powered by accretion onto a @xmath6stellar mass compact objects .",
    "this result constrains the range of possible models for ulxs .",
    "their frequency and luminosity distributions should be a smooth extension towards higher luminosities of that of `` ordinary '' @xmath6stellar mass systems , emerging from the standard stellar evolution sequence .",
    "although some of the ulxs might be indeed rare and exotic objects , it appears that majority of them can not be a completely different type of the source population , but , rather , represent the high mass , high @xmath46 tail of the hmxb population .",
    "the luminosity of ulxs in the nearby galaxies has a maximum value of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the galaxies from the hubble deep field north obey the same @xmath4sfr relation ( fig.[fig : lx - sfr - break ] ) , implies , that the ulxs at the redshift of @xmath3 were not significantly more luminous , that those observed in the nearby galaxies .",
    "the hypothetical intermediate mass black holes , probably reaching masses of @xmath47 , might be produced , e.g. via black hole merges in the dense stellar clusters , and can be associated with extremely high star formation rates .",
    "to accrete efficiently , they should form close binary systems with normal stars or be located in dense molecular clouds .",
    "it is natural to expect , that such objects are significantly less frequent than @xmath6stellar mass black holes .",
    "the transition from the @xmath6stellar mass bh hmxb to intermediate mass bhs should manifest itself as a step in the luminosity distribution of compact sources ( fig.[fig : imbh ] , left panel ) .",
    "if the cut - off in the hmxb luminosity function , observed at @xmath48 corresponds to the maximum possible luminosity of @xmath6stellar mass black holes and if at @xmath49 a population of hypothetical intermediate mass bhs emerges , it should lead to a drastic change in the slope of the @xmath33sfr relation at extreme values of sfr @xcite ( fig.[fig : imbh ] , right panel ) .",
    "therefore , observations of distant star forming galaxies with very high sfr might be an easy way to probe the population of intermediate mass black holes .",
