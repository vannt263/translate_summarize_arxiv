    "lateral localization of excitons in semiconductors quantum wells has been the subject of theoretical and experimental research in the last few years .",
    "such one dimensional traps can be realized , e.g. , by using nonhomogeneous stress to induce a hydrostatic expansion which creates an energy minimum for the excitons @xcite .",
    "another way is to apply 1d spatial varying electrical potentials in the plane of the quantum well and to use the quantum - confined stark effect in order to create a minimum in the exciton effective potential @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical @xcite studies on exciton confinement have shown the feasibility of exciton trapping by using circular ( two dimensional ) magnetic traps .",
    "due to recent advances in the design and manufacture of microstructured magnetic potentials @xcite , several works have been published on the study of magnetic barriers and magnetic superlattices .",
    "however , the majority of these experimental and theoretical investigations study the influence of such magnetic potentials on the properties of charged particles , e.g. , electrons @xcite .    in this work , we propose a natural extension of such magnetic systems : the confinement of excitons in linear magnetic traps or magnetic wire structures .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "2 gives a brief description of the magnetic wire structures .",
    "the theoretical model for the description of the exciton motion in a quantum well in the presence of linear magnetic traps is given in sec .",
    "the discussion of the numerical results follows in sec .",
    "4 . as an example",
    "we show the results for gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum wells .",
    "finally , a summary of our results is presented in sec .",
    "magnetic confinement potentials can be created by depositing ferromagnetic stripes on top of a semiconductor quantum well . an additional external homogeneous magnetic field can be applied to the system in order to maximize the confinement .",
    "a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in figure 1(a ) , and a schematic cross section of the stripe with perpendicular and in - plane magnetization can be seen in the left and right side of figure 1(b ) , respectively . in this system ,",
    "only the @xmath2 component of the magnetic field is responsible for the magnetic modulation , and can be calculated through coulomb s law @xcite .    the corresponding equation for the @xmath2 component of the magnetic field , assuming a stripe with magnetization perpendicular to the @xmath3 plane , located at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the stripe width ( thickness ) , can be written as follows :    @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a stripe with in - plane magnetization the corresponding result is @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12    in the above equations",
    ", @xmath2 is the distance of the center of the stripe to the middle of the quantum well , @xmath13 is the stripe magnetization , and @xmath14 the uniform applied magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field for the stripe with perpendicular ( solid curve ) and in - plane ( dashed curve ) magnetization is shown in figure 1(c ) .",
    "notice that , in the case of a perpendicular magnetization , the exciton will experience a positive effective magnetic field underneath the stripe and negative elsewhere as sketched on the left side of figure 1(b ) [ see also solid curve in figure 1(c ) ] .",
    "the situation is completely different for the stripe with in - plane magnetization , where now the effective magnetic field has a negative peak in the region near the edge of the stripe which corresponds to the direction of @xmath13 ( at @xmath15 ) and a positive peak near the other ( at @xmath16 ) edge [ see right side of figure 1(b ) and dashed curve in figure 1(c ) ] .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the exciton motion in a quantum well in a nonhomogeneous magnetic field , with isotropic electron and heavy - hole effective masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , can be written in the following way : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hamiltonian describing the electron and heavy hole confinement in the quantum well , i.e. , in the @xmath2 direction ; @xmath21 is related to the difference between the 2d and 3d coulomb interaction and is treated as a perturbation , where @xmath22 is a variational parameter which is chosen such that it minimizes @xmath23 , as discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite ; @xmath24 describes the exciton motion in the @xmath3 plane in a nonhomogeneous magnetic field , which is described by the vector potential in the landau gauge @xmath25 . in writing the above equation",
    ", we introduced the exciton relative and center - of - mass motion coordinates , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , with the total exciton mass @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the last term in equation ( [ ham1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath29 b_{z}(x ) - \\frac{2}{3 } \\sum_{i=1}^{3}c_{i}s_{e , i}{}j_{h , i } ,   \\label{hspin1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian describing the exciton spin interaction with the nonhomogeneous magnetic field , which is oriented along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we consider here that the contribution of the spin interaction with the in - plane magnetic field is very small and can be neglected @xcite . in writing down the above spin hamiltonian",
    ", the adiabatic approximation was used , which assumes that the relative motion is fast as compared to the center - of - mass motion .",
    "this allows us to expand the magnetic field to zero order in the relative motion coordinate @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 2e ) , @xmath30 is the bohr magneton , @xmath31 is the total exciton spin quantum number , which is related to the electron ( @xmath32 ) and heavy - hole ( @xmath33 ) spin quantum numbers , @xmath34 is the spin - spin coupling constant related to the zero field spin interaction , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the @xmath2 component of the electron and heavy - hole @xmath37 factor , respectively @xcite .    following the approach of freire _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the @xmath38 hamiltonian [ see equation ( [ h2d1 ] ) ] can be simplified by using a transformation of the wave function analogous to the one used in the homogeneous magnetic field case , which assumes the existence of an exact integral of motion , namely the magnetic center - of - mass momentum @xcite : @xmath39 \\psi ^{m_z } ( { \\mathbf r},{\\mathbf r},z_{e},z_{h } ) .",
    "\\label{wavetrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further , we can use the adiabatic approximation to expand the vector potential up to the second order in the relative motion coordinates , i.e. , @xmath40    inserting equations ( [ wavetrans ] ) and ( [ vectexpans ] ) into equation ( [ h2d1 ] ) , the @xmath41 hamiltonian can be separated in relative and center - of - mass motion hamiltonians , i.e. , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is the exciton reduced mass , and @xmath47 .",
    "the procedure used to go from equation ( [ h2d1 ] ) to equation ( [ w1w2 ] ) is analogous to the one used in our previous work [ see equations ( 1)-(7 ) in reference @xcite ] on the trapping of excitons in circular magnetic traps .    to find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , equation ( [ ham1 ] )",
    ", we use the adiabatic approximation to decouple the exciton center - of - mass motion , which is slow , from the exciton relative motion , which is fast .",
    "we already assumed that the spin degrees of freedom depend only on the center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "thus , the total exciton wave function becomes a product of the wave function of the decoupled motions : @xmath48    the energy of the exciton confinement in the quantum well ( @xmath2 direction ) , i.e. , the eigenvalue of @xmath49 , does not dependent on the magnetic field and therefore will not contribute to the magnetic exciton trapping energy .",
    "therefore , this energy does not have to be calculated explicitly . in order to solve the variational equation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , to calculate @xmath22",
    "we follow the same procedure as described in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the equation for the exciton relative motion @xmath52 are calculated using a perturbation technique , i.e. , all the @xmath53-dependent terms [ see @xmath54 and @xmath55 in equation ( [ w1w2 ] ) ] are treated as perturbations .",
    "a full discussion of the calculation method for the relative motion energy is given in reference @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the spin energies can be easily calculated .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath56 can be written as @xmath57 b_{z}(x)$ ] @xcite . in writing @xmath58",
    ", we neglected the terms which do not depend on the magnetic field ( @xmath59 ) , and the terms with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 cancel because of symmetry considerations .",
    "the different sign in the above spin energy are related to the total spin quantum number @xmath62 ( which is connected with the @xmath63 polarized states ) and @xmath64 ( which is related to the dark excitons ) @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the @xmath65 states will not be considered because they are not optically active .",

    "notice that in contrast to the case of exciton trapping through 1d scalar potentials created by an electric field @xcite , the effective potential for linear magnetic traps depends on the exciton wave vector @xmath69 [ see first term in equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] .",
    "the main contribution for the exciton confinement is given by the two last terms in the effective potential equation ( [ effecpot ] ) , which are the orbital and spin zeeman terms , respectively .",
    "the latter is a sensitive function of the exciton @xmath37 factor @xcite .",
    "the diamagnetic contribution for the exciton effective potential [ see second term in equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] contains the contribution of the well confinement through the parameter @xmath22 , which can be very important for exciton trapping when the orbital and the spin contribution are negligible , i.e. , when the exciton angular momentum is zero and the exciton @xmath37 factor is small @xcite .",
    "the trapping energy is defined as the difference in exciton energy for an exciton in a homogeneous applied field @xmath14 and the corresponding state in the nonhomogeneous magnetic field . for our numerical calculations we used the following parameters for the ferromagnetic stripe : width @xmath78 @xmath79 m , thickness @xmath80 @xmath79 m , distance to the center of the quantum well @xmath81 @xmath79 m , and the value of the stripe magnetization corresponding to iron @xmath82 emu/@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we used for the gaas / al@xmath84ga@xmath85as quantum well an effective mass @xmath86 for electrons and @xmath87 for heavy - holes ( @xmath88 is the free space electron mass ) , and the gaas dieletric constant @xmath89 .",
    "the different @xmath37 factors are taken from reference @xcite and depend on the width of the gaas quantum well .    the effective potential and the corresponding effective mass for the exciton confinement [ see equation ( [ effecpot ] ) and ( [ effecmass ] ) , respectively ] for the exciton 1s ground state",
    "are shown in figure [ figure2](a ) as a function of the center - of - mass @xmath90 coordinate for the stripe with perpendicular magnetization , and in figure [ figure2](b ) for the stripe with in - plane magnetization . in these figures",

    "notice that the effective potentials for @xmath95 and @xmath97 @xmath79m@xmath96 are only slightly different , which suggests that the corresponding energies are close to each other and that the contribution of the @xmath69-dependent term to the exciton confinement potential [ see first term in equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] is small .",
    "also notice that for the case of perpendicular magnetization , the effective potential for @xmath98 has two minima near the edge of the magnetic stripe , which will be the position where the exciton will be magnetically trapped .",
    "for the parallel magnetization case and also for the perpendicular one when @xmath99 , the potential minimum occurs underneath the magnetic stripe and the exciton localizes exactly under the magnetic stripe .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that for a given magnetization , the exciton spin interaction with the nonhomogeneous magnetic field can be responsible for a displacement in the minimum of the effective potential related to the different @xmath100 polarized states , which is due to a change in the sign of the spin contribution [ see last term in equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] .",
    "the trapping energy of the exciton ground state as a function of the exciton wave vector @xmath69 is shown in figure [ figure3 ] for an applied field of @xmath92 t and a well width @xmath91  , for the stripe with perpendicular [ figure [ figure3](a ) for @xmath101 and [ figure3](b ) for @xmath102 and in - plane [ figure [ figure3](c ) for @xmath101 and [ figure3](d ) for @xmath102 magnetization .",
    "the trapping energy has a parabolic dispersion as expected for free particle like motion [ see equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] .",
    "the effect of the center - of - mass momentum @xmath69 on the exciton trapping energy is very small .",
    "notice that the term @xmath103 , which does not depend on the magnetic field , is not included in the calculation of the trapping energy .",
    "only the contribution due to the nonhomogeneous magnetic field is shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "experimentally , it is very useful to control the exciton localization by means of tunable parameters , e.g. , electric and magnetic fields , without the necessity of changing the structural parameters ( e.g. , quantum well width ) . for that purpose",
    ", we analyzed the dependence of the exciton trapping energy under the influence of an external applied homogeneous magnetic field @xmath14 , which is able to change completely the effective potential responsible for the trapping of the exciton .",
    "figures [ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] show the exciton trapping energy as a function of the applied field @xmath14 , for the stripe with perpendicular and in - plane magnetization , respectively , for the exciton 1s ground state .",
    "results are given for quantum well widths @xmath104 50  ( a ) , 100  ( b ) , and 150  ( c ) .",
    "the exciton is always trapped in the case @xmath94 , except for a quantum well width @xmath105  .",
    "the reason is that the corresponding exciton @xmath37 factor for this well width is almost zero @xcite , which greatly decreases the importance of the spin term in the effective potential expression [ see equation ( [ effecpot ] ) ] .",
    "this is also the explanation for the large difference in magnitude ( 2 orders in some cases ) of the energy scale for @xmath106 and @xmath107  as compared to the @xmath105  situation .",
    "the trapping energy of the stripe with in - plane magnetization ( figure [ figure5 ] ) has a completely different behavior from the one with perpendicular magnetization .",
    "first of all , the energy is an even function of the applied field @xmath14 due to the functional behavior of the corresponding nonhomogeneous magnetic field [ see dashed line in figure [ figure1 ] ] . for certain quantum well widths there",
    "exists also a critical field @xmath14 below which the exciton is not trapped . changing the spin quantum number from @xmath94 into @xmath93",
    "drastically changes the exciton confinement dependence on the quantum well width for both magnetization directions . using these results",
    ", one can choose an optimal situation in which the effect of the nonhomogeneous magnetic field on the exciton confinement is maximal and can be detected by photoluminescence ( pl ) experiments . by changing the applied magnetic field strength , one can modify the position of the line spectra in the pl experiments related to the @xmath100 polarized states in such a way that only one of them exist ( the other will be a dark state ) , which may make the effect of the magnetic field on the exciton confinement easier to detect .    due to the competition between the diamagnetic interaction , the spin interaction and the applied magnetic field ,",
    "the exciton can be confined in different regions of space .",
    "this is illustrated in figures [ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] , where we show the wave function for the exciton ground state as a function of the @xmath90 coordinate , for the stripe with perpendicular and in - plane magnetization , respectively , for spin quantum numbers ( a ) @xmath108 and ( b ) @xmath101 , and for different values of the applied field @xmath14 .",
    "notice that there is no confined exciton for the @xmath93 state when @xmath109 , which is not the case for the @xmath94 state .",
    "this can be easily explained by looking at the corresponding effective potentials [ see dotted curves in the inset of figures [ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] ] .",
    "there is no confinement region for the exciton when @xmath93 .",
    "notice that for the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) situation [ see figure [ figure6](a ) and [ figure6](b ) , respectively ] , the wave function is located near the two edges of the ferromagnetic stripe for @xmath14 positive ( negative ) and underneath the stripe for @xmath14 negative ( positive ) . for the in - plane magnetization situation",
    "[ figure [ figure7 ] ] , the exciton is confined at one of the edges of the stripe for @xmath93 . changing the sign of the background field switches the exciton from one side of the ferromagnetic edge to the other .",
    "a similar behavior is found for @xmath94 but : ( i ) the position of the exciton for a given @xmath14 is at the opposite edge from the one for @xmath93 ; and ( ii ) for @xmath109 t , the exciton is bound and its wave function is symmetric .",
    "this magnetic field dependence is consistent with the @xmath110 symmetry of the binding energy [ see figure [ figure5 ] ] .",
    "we studied the behavior of quasi-2d excitons in the presence of 1d magnetic traps . in this system ,",
    "the excitons are confined into quantum wire like states .",
    "such linear magnetic potentials can be created experimentally by the deposition of a ferromagnetic stripe on top of a semiconductor quantum well with an additional external magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the stripe in order to maximize the exciton confinement . in this paper",
    ", we studied both possibilities of the stripe magnetization , i.e , magnetization parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the quantum well .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows : ( i ) excitons can be trapped by linear magnetic traps ; ( ii ) the dependence of the confinement energy on the exciton wave vector is small , but the exciton confinement is very sensitive to its spin orientation ; and ( iii ) the confinement of excitons in such systems can be controlled by an external tunable parameter , i.e. , an applied magnetic field . by changing the strength of the magnetic field one can move the confinement region from underneath the magnetic stripe to its edges or even to one of the edges . for the case of parallel magnetization , the external magnetic field can move the confinement region from one edge of the magnetic stripe to the other edge of the stripe .",
    "the numerical obtained trapping energies are rather small but they can be increased substantially if the amplitude of the modulated magnetic field ( see figure 1(c ) ) is enhanced .",
    "we also showed that the applied magnetic field can make a bright exciton becomes a dark one .",
    "this transformation is very sensitive to the quantum well width , the magnetization of the magnetic stripe , and the exciton spin contribution , i.e. through the value of the effective g - factor .",
    "our results can help the design of experiments to probe the exciton trapping by giving a very good estimate of the set of parameters for which the confined exciton can be detected , i.e. , where the exciton is actually trapped in the magnetic wire - like confinement potential .",
    "further , the spatial displacement of the exciton localization as controlled by changing the external applied magnetic field , from e.g. one edge of the magnetic stripe to the other , can be used experimentally to detect and analyze the effect of the nonhomogeneous magnetic field on the exciton motion .",
    "our work is expected to provide useful insights and stimulate further developments in experimental work involving trapping of excitons in nonhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
