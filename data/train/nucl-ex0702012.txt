    "a new state - of - the - art general - purpose detector is proposed by the @xmath0anda collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it will be installed at the high energy storage ring , hesr , one of the main components of the international fair facility at gsi , darmstadt .",
    "the detector is designed to take advantage of the extraordinary physics potential which becomes available by utilizing high - intensity , phase - space - cooled antiproton beams with momenta between 1 and 15 gev / c .",
    "due to the fixed target kinematics , the detector has an asymmetric shape and consist of two parts - the target spectrometer and the forward spectrometer , see  .",
    "the central tracker of the target spectrometer consists of two main parts : the micro - vertex detector ( mvd ) and the straw tube tracker ( stt ) .",
    "anda detector from the top .",
    "the total length of the detector will be about 12 m .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite . ]",
    "the stt consists of 11 cylindrical double layers of straws at radial distances of between 15@xmath4 cm and 42@xmath4 cm from the beam and with an overall length of 150@xmath4 cm .",
    "the geometrical center of the stt is shifted 35 cm downstream with respect to the target position to provide better acceptance in the forward hemisphere .",
    "the individual straw tubes have diameters of 6 mm for the five innermost double layers , and 8 mm for the outer layers .",
    "the gas mixture chosen for the straw tracker is @xmath1 + 10%@xmath2 .",
    "the relatively small tube diameters and the chosen gas provide maximum drift times comparable with the average time between events ( 100ns ) .",
    "every other double layer can be skewed with respect to the beam axis by an angle ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 to obtain the coordinate of the track along the beam direction with about 4 mm precision .",
    "however , the skew angle causes the stereolayers to form a hyperboloidal shape , which makes the track reconstruction and mechanical design more complicated . as an alternative",
    ", it is proposed to use the charge - division technique instead of skewed layers , thereby simplifying the overall stt design and allowing the straws to be glued together thus forming a self - supporting construction , and significantly reducing the amount of passive material needed for structural reasons .",
    "the straw tubes used for testing the charge division principle are made of two thin mylar@xmath7 strips @xmath8 m in thickness and 16 mm in width that are wound helically with a half - overlap and glued together . including 6@xmath9 m glue , the total straw tube wall thickness is @xmath10 m .",
    "the straw tubes were supplied by an industrial manufacturer  @xcite . the inner part of the inner strip is metallized and the inner diameter of the straw tube is 10 mm .",
    "the anode wire is made of w / re alloy and is 20@xmath11 m in diameter .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse cross sections of the straw tube are shown in  .",
    "wires with different re concentrations were tested .",
    "as can be seen in  , wires with a higher percentage of re have better mechanical properties .",
    "the region of plastic deformation for the 20-@xmath9 m diameter wire with 3% re already starts at a tension of about 65 g , while for wire of the same diameter with 18% re no plastic deformation is observed up to a wire tension of 110 g . for the 1.52-m - long straw",
    "the required anode wire tensions are 32 g and 58 g for the 15- and 20-@xmath9 m diameter wires , respectively , in order to achieve a gravitational sag of the wires of less than 30@xmath11 m .",
    "it is preferable to make use of wires with an increased percentage of re in order to have an adequate safety margin .",
    "the straw tube performance was studied using collimated radioactive sources .",
    "an @xmath12fe source was used to study the ultimate spatial resolution limitations of the method and a @xmath13sr source was used to test the charge division performance with realistic detector response .",
    "the experimental setup is shown schematically in  .",
    "the signals at the both ends of the straw are read out by cosy - tof experiment  @xcite type preamplifiers , attached directly to the anode wire feedthroughs .",
    "the amplifier outputs were connected to the tektronix@xmath7 5054b oscilloscope , which was used for the data acquisition . in order to cut high - frequency noise the bandwidth of the oscilloscope",
    "was reduced to 20mhz , thus increasing the signal rise time from 3 - 4ns to 10 - 15ns ( see  ) .",
    "the pulse decay time was about 40ns .",
    "these preamplifiers are optimized for the drift time measurement and it can therefore be expected that optimizing the shaping characteristics of the preamplifiers should further improve the results presented below .    , and the @xmath12fe source is placed at the end of the straw tube . ]",
    "these signals were parametrized by the following equation @xmath14 where the parameter @xmath15 is a scaling factor and the values of the other parameters were obtained from a fit to measured signals : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the _ linear charge asymmetry _ due to charge sharing between the tube ends can be expressed as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the actual position of the source along the straw tube with @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the real tube length , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the charges collected on the left and right ends of the straw , respectively .",
    "the _ effective _ tube length @xmath26 can be defined as follows : @xmath27 finally , the reconstructed longitudinal coordinate @xmath28 can be calculated in the following way : @xmath29 the actual values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 depend on the ratio of the wire resistance to the input impedance of the preamplifiers , which were determined from calibration measurements .",
    "it should be noted that the definition of @xmath26 implicitly assumes that the input impedances of the preamplifiers and their relative gain are identical . to determine the amplifier characteristics ,",
    "the collimated @xmath12fe source was placed exactly at the center ( i.e. @xmath32 ) of the 1.05-m - long straw tube with the anode wire made of w / re ( 97/3 ) alloy with a resistance of @xmath33 .",
    "the fitted mean value of the reconstructed position distribution was found to be @xmath34 cm compared to the expected value @xmath32 . after correcting the input impedances and gains of the preamplifiers ,",
    "the mean value was reduced to @xmath35 mm , as shown by the right peak in  .",
    "the source was then placed at @xmath36 cm with respect to the tube center .",
    "the reconstructed source position was @xmath37 cm .",
    "the maximum observed deviation of @xmath38 was 2 mm , which is significantly smaller than the typical spatial resolution of about 1 to 3 cm ( cf .  ) .",
    "this small deviation from the linear behavior is included as a systematic error below .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal resolution ( defined as the standard deviation of the gaussian fit to the measured position distribution ) is determined to be @xmath39 cm or @xmath40% of the length in the center and @xmath41 cm or @xmath42% at the end of the tube .    fe source located at @xmath21=-51.0 cm and 0.0 cm along the @xmath43-m - long straw tube with the w / re ( 97/3 ) wire of 20-@xmath9 m diameter . the position resolution at the center and at the end was found to be @xmath39 cm and @xmath41 cm , respectively .",
    "the x - scale corresponds to one half of the tube length . ]",
    "a 1.52-m - long straw tube with an anode wire made of w / re ( 82/18 ) alloy was used for the further tests .",
    "this wire has a specific resistance of @xmath44 .",
    "the total resistance of the 1.52-m wire was 600@xmath45 .",
    "the increased resistance leads to a higher signal asymmetry and thus to a better relative spatial resolution .",
    "the @xmath12fe source was placed at three locations : @xmath46 cm and -8.0 cm .",
    "shows the @xmath28 spectrum after applying the calibration procedure .",
    "longitudinal resolutions of @xmath47 cm ( 1.3% ) and @xmath48 cm ( 2.1% ) were determined near the tube center and at the end , respectively .",
    "fe source located at @xmath49 cm and -8.0 cm along the @xmath50-m - long straw tube with the w / re ( 82/18 ) wire of 20@xmath9 m diameter .",
    "the position resolutions near the center and at the ends were found to be @xmath47 cm and @xmath48 cm , respectively . ]",
    "when using the charge division technique , the longitudinal spatial resolution improves when the signal asymmetry is increased because the resolution is dominated by noise",
    ". the noise can be separated into series and parallel components  @xcite .",
    "parallel - noise components , such as rf - pickup or noisy power supplies , induce correlated signals of the same sign at both ends of the straw tube .",
    "series noise induces either anticorrelated or uncorrelated signals in the preamplifiers , e.g. thermal noises in the anode wire and preamplifiers , respectively .",
    "pure incoherent series noise will result in a constant spatial resolution along the anode wire .",
    "pure anticorrelated series noise will have the poorest resolution in the center of the wire , and pure parallel noise will have the best resolution in the center of the wire .",
    "the _ time - dependent charge asymmetry _ is a novel method to determine the longitudinal coordinate , and it differs from the _ linear charge asymmetry _ by taking into account not only the signal charges but also the differences in the arrival times of the signals , allowing for a significant increase of the asymmetry magnitude up to the maximum value of 1 .",
    "technically , this is done by integrating both signals in a narrow gate starting after the arrival of the first signal , as shown in  .     and",
    "@xmath51 are the time shift due to different signal propagation times and the signal integration time , respectively . ]",
    "the signal from the far end of the tube is shifted by @xmath52 due to the longer propagation time .",
    "both signals are integrated during the time @xmath51 . as can be clearly seen from  , a larger fraction is integrated for the signal arriving first .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath51 must be larger than the maximum @xmath52 , otherwise the correlation between the coordinate and asymmetry becomes ambiguous .    a plot of the time - dependent asymmetry for the @xmath50-m straw tube with the w / re ( 82/18 ) wire is shown in   for an @xmath12fe source located in three places ( @xmath46 cm , -8.0 cm ) .",
    "from this figure it can be seen that the amplitude of the time - dependent asymmetry is much higher than for the linear asymmetry , where the maximum amplitude only reaches values of about @xmath53 for this straw tube .",
    "fe source located at @xmath49 cm and -8.0 cm along the @xmath50-m straw tube with the w / re ( 82/18 ) wire of 20@xmath9 m diameter .",
    "the integration time @xmath51 is @xmath54 . ]    conversion of the time - dependent asymmetry into the longitudinal position , however , requires attention because the dependence between the asymmetry and the position is no longer linear , as illustrated in  .",
    "-m straw tube with the high - resistance wire .",
    "the curves ( a ) and ( b ) represent the dependence of the linear and time - dependent signal asymmetry on the source position along the straw tube , respectively . ]",
    "the time - dependent asymmetry shown in this figure ( curve ( b ) ) was computed numerically by the following method .",
    "was used to represent the shape of the signals from the straw tube .",
    "the amplitudes of the signals at each end of the tube were determined for an arbitrary position of the source using the linear charge asymmetry ( curve ( a ) in  ) for an effective tube length of 546 cm .",
    "the arrival time difference @xmath52 was calculated for each point using the signal propagation speed along the straw tube , which was measured to be @xmath55cm / ns .",
    "charges obtained by integration of these signals during the integration time @xmath51 were inserted into  .",
    "the best resolution was obtained for @xmath51 equals 10ns .",
    "the curve obtained for the time - dependent charge asymmetry was used to convert the measured charge asymmetry ( see  ) into the longitudinal position shown in  .",
    "longitudinal position resolutions of @xmath56 cm ( 0.6% ) and @xmath57 cm ( 2.0% ) were determined at the tube center and end , respectively .",
    "the systematic error increases towards the ends of the tube compared to the region near the tube center because of the non - linear dependence of @xmath28 on the measured asymmetry .",
    "fe source located at @xmath49 cm and -8.0 cm along the @xmath50-m straw tube with the w / re ( 82/18 ) wire of 20@xmath9 m diameter , based on the time - dependent signal asymmetry .",
    "the position resolutions near the center and at the ends were found to be @xmath56 cm and @xmath57 cm , respectively . ]    overall , the longitudinal position resolution is significantly improved compared to the linear charge asymmetry ( cf .  ) .",
    "the longitudinal position resolution is improved in those regions where the slope of the time - dependent asymmetry as a function of @xmath21 is steeper than the slope of the linear method .",
    "since the functional dependence of the asymmetry on @xmath21 is non - linear ( see  ) , the improvement in the position resolution varies along the length of the straw tube .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in  , which shows the ratio of the slopes for the time - dependent and the linear asymmetries .",
    "for the time - dependent asymmetry @xmath58 and the linear charge asymmetry @xmath59 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "]    the time - dependent asymmetry gives a better position resolution in the region where this ratio is greater than 1 .",
    "ratio of the derivatives increases for decreasing integration time , thereby improving the longitudinal position resolution .",
    "however , at the same time both the non - linearity and the relative preamplifier noise increase , thereby worsening the resolution .",
    "thus , the integration time is determined by optimizing the longitudinal position resolution of the straw tube .",
    "to study the applicability of this method to a realistic detector response , a collimated @xmath61 @xmath62 radioactive source was used to produce signals from minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) .",
    "the average number of electrons arriving at the same moment at the anode wire is much smaller for mip tracks compared to the clusters of ionization produced by the @xmath63 source .",
    "therefore , the average signal amplitude from the straw tube is significantly smaller .",
    "in addition , the signal fluctuations are much higher due to the nature of the mip ionization .",
    "this leads to a deterioration of the relative errors of the signal charge determination . to compensate these effects and improve the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the integration time @xmath51 should be increased . in this case , the position resolution was optimized with @xmath6420ns .",
    "source located at @xmath49 cm and -8.0 cm along the @xmath50-m straw tube with the w / re ( 82/18 ) wire of 20@xmath9 m diameter .",
    "the integration time @xmath51 is @xmath65ns .",
    "the position resolutions at the center and at the end were found to be @xmath57 cm and @xmath66 cm , respectively . ]",
    "shows the @xmath28 distribution when the straw tube is irradiated at @xmath46 cm and -8.0 cm .",
    "the observed resolutions for @xmath28 near the center and at the end were found to be @xmath57 cm ( 1.8% ) and @xmath66 cm ( 4.0% ) , respectively .",
    "prototype straw tube detectors for the upcoming @xmath0anda experiment have been assembled and tested .",
    "the longitudinal position resolution of a tube was investigated using both the linear charge division and the time - dependent asymmetry techniques . by adding the time information to the standard charge division method a significant improvement in the precision of the position reconstruction along the straw tube was demonstrated .    the longitudinal position resolution in the center and at the end of the @xmath50-m straw tube , irradiated by the @xmath12fe radioactive source ,",
    "was determined as @xmath67 cm ( 1.2% of the tube length ) and @xmath68 cm ( 2.0% ) , respectively , with a maximum deviation from linearity of about 0.8 cm ( 0.5% ) using the asymmetry of the fully integrated signal charges at both ends of the straw tube . by additionally using in the relative signal arrival time information",
    ", it was possible to improve the resolution and the linearity to 0.89 cm ( 0.6% ) and 0.2 mm ( 0.1% ) near the tube center and to 2.5 cm ( 1.7% ) and 1.0 cm ( 0.7% ) at the tube end , respectively .",
    "the resolution with a @xmath61 @xmath62 source is poorer because of the smaller signals and larger fluctuations for the minimum ionizing particles .",
    "the longitudinal position resolution in the tube center is @xmath69 cm ( 1.7% ) deteriorating to @xmath70 cm ( 4.2% ) at the end of the tube .",
    "the maximum deviation from linearity was about 1.2 cm ( 0.8% ) .",
    "in addition to the improved resolution , the time - dependent charge asymmetry has the advantage that very short integration times can be used with fast shaping amplifiers , thus permitting higher rate capabilities .",
    "also , an acceptable position resolution can be achieved even for anode wires with relatively small resistance .",
    "it is expected that the results obtained here can be improved since the preamplifiers used were optimized for time resolution in order to determine the transverse coordinate .",
    "further studies are ongoing to optimize the signal shaping parameters of the preamplifier for both the timing and charge integration performance ."
