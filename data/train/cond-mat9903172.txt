    "the resonant tunneling of electromagnetic waves through different types of optical barriers is a fast developing area of optical physics .",
    "this effect was first considered for photonic crystals,@xcite where forbidden band - gaps in the electromagnetic spectrum form optical barriers .",
    "macroscopic defects embedded in the photonic crystal give rise to local photon modes , yablonovitch1,joannopoulos , smith , figotin , sakoda which induce the resonant transmission of electromagnetic waves through the band - gaps .",
    "a different type of photonic band gaps arises in polar dielectrics , where a strong resonance interaction between the electromagnetic field and dipole active internal excitations of a dielectric brings about a gap between different branches of polaritons .",
    "recently it was suggested that regular microscopic impurities embedded in such a dielectric give rise to local polariton states,@xcite where a photon is coupled to an intrinsic excitation of a crystal , and both these components are localized in the vicinity of the defect.@xcite the main peculiarity of the local polaritons is that their electromagnetic component is bound by a _",
    "microscopic _ defect whose size is many order of magnitude smaller then the wavelengths of respective photons .",
    "another important property of these states is the absence of a threshold for their appearance even in 3-_d _ isotropic systems , while for all other known local states the `` strength '' of a defect must exceed a certain critical value before the state would split off a continous spectrum .",
    "the reason for this peculiar behavior is a strong van hove singularity in the polariton density of states in the long wave region , caused by a negative effective mass of the polariton - forming excitations of a crystal .",
    "the feasibility of resonant electromagnetic tunneling induced by local polaritons , however , is not self - evident .",
    "the idea of a microscopic defect affecting propagation of waves with macroscopic wavelength seems to be in contradiction with common wisdom .",
    "besides , it was found that the energy of the electromagnetic component of local polaritons is very small compared to the energy of its crystal counterpart .",
    "the existence of the tunneling effect was first numerically demonstrated in ref . , where a 1-_d _ chain of dipoles interacting with a scalar field imitating transverse electromagnetic waves was considered .",
    "it was found that a single defect embedded in such a chain results in near @xmath0 transmission at the frequency of local polaritons through a relatively short chain ( @xmath1 atoms ) .",
    "the frequency profile of the transmission was found to be strongly assymetric , in contrast to the case of electron tunneling.@xcite    in most cases ( at least for a small concentration of the transmitting centers ) one - dimensional models give a reliable description of tunneling processes , because by virtue of tunneling , a wave propagates along a chain of resonance centers , for which a 1-_d _ topology has the highest probability of occurrence.@xcite in our situation , it is also important that the local polariton states ( transmitting centers ) occur without a threshold in 3-_d _ systems as well as in 1-_d _ systems .",
    "this ensures that the transmission resonances found in ref .",
    "are not artifacts of the one - dimensional nature of the model , and justifies a further development of the model . in the present paper",
    "we pursue this development in two interconnected directions .",
    "first , we present an exact analytical solution of the transmission problem through the chain with a single defect .",
    "this solution explains the unusual asymmetric shape of the transmission profile found in numerical calculations@xcite and provides insight into the phenomenon under consideration .",
    "second , we carry out numerical monte - carlo simulation of the electromagnetic transmission through a macroscopically long chain with a finite concentration of defects , and study the development of a defect - induced electromagnetic pass band within the polariton band - gap .",
    "the analytical solution of a single - defect model allows us to suggest a physical interpretation for some of the peculiarities of the transmission found in numerical simulations . as a by - product of our numerical results we present a new algorithm used for the computation of the transmission",
    "this algorithms is based upon a blend of transfer - matrix approach with ideas of the invariant - embedding method,@xcite and proves to be extremely stable even deep inside the band - gap , where traditional methods would not work .    though we consider the one - dimensional model , the results obtained are suggestive for experimental observation of the predicted effects .",
    "actually the damping of the electromagnetic waves is more experimentally restrictive than the topology of the system .",
    "we , however , discuss the effects due to damping and come to the conclusion that the effects under discussion can be observed in regular ionic crystals in the region of their phonon - polariton band - gaps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction is followed by an analytical solution of the transmission problem in a single - impurity situation .",
    "the next section presents results of monte - carlo computer simulations .",
    "the algorithm used in numerical calculations is derived and discussed in the appendix .",

    "calculation of the integrals appearing in the 3-@xmath26 theory requires detailed knowledge of the spectrum of excitations of a crystal throughout the entire brillouin band .",

    "the most important fact is that the frequency profile of the resonance does not have the typical symmetric laurentian shape . at @xmath112",

    ", the behavior of the transmission coefficient in the vicinities of these two frequencies is essentially different : at the band edge it is @xmath115 while at the defect frequency the transmission goes to zero as @xmath116 .",
    "these facts can be used to predict several effects that would occur with the increase of the concentration of the defects .",
    "first , one can note that with the increase of concentration of the impurities frequency @xmath114 becomes eventually the boundary of the new polariton gap when all the original host atoms will be replaced by the defects atoms .",

    "numerical calculations discussed in the next section of the paper show that this effect does take place even at rather small concentration of the defects .",
    "resonance tunneling is very sensitive to the presence of relaxation , which phenomenologically can be accounted for by adding @xmath118 to the denominator of the polarizability @xmath92 , where @xmath119 is an effective relaxation parameter .",

    "( [ transmission1 ] ) from canceling out at the resonance .",
    "this restricts the length of the system in which the resonance can occur and limit the enhancement of the field at the defect .",
    "these restrictions though are not specific for the system under consideration and affect experimental manifestation of any type of resonant tunneling phenomenon .",

    "this is a rather strict condition that can only be satisfied for high frequency oscillations with large oscillator strength in crystals with large interatomic spacing , @xmath24 .",

    "the tunneling is mediated by local polariton states  arising due to defect atoms embedded in an otherwise ideal periodic chain .",
    "we also numerically studied how a defect - induced propagating band emerges from these resonances when the concentration of defects increases .",
    "it is important to emphasize the difference between the situation considered in our paper and other types of tunneling phenomena discussed in the literature .",
    "the tunneling of electromagnetic waves through photonic crystals and electron tunneling , despite all the difference between these phenomena , share one common feature . in both cases",
    ", the resonance occurs due to defects that have dimensions comparable with wavelengths of the respective excitations ( electrons interact with atomic impurities , and long wave electromagnetic waves interact with macroscopic distortions of the photonic crystals ) . in our case",
    "the wavelength of the propagating excitations is many orders of magnitude greater than dimensions of the atomic defects responsible for the resonance .",
    "the physical reason for such an unusual behavior lies in the nature of local polaritons .",
    "these states are formed owing to the presence of internal polariton - forming excitations .",
    "the spatial extent of these states is much larger than the geometrical dimensions of atomic defects and is comparable to the wavelength of the incident radiation .",
    "we presented an exact analytical solution of the tunneling of electromagnetic waves through a chain of noninteracting atoms with a single defect .",
    "this solution provides insight into the nature of the phenomenon under considerarion and allows one to obtain an explicit expression for the magnitude of the electromagnetic field at the defect site .",
    "the expression derived demonstrates that the field is strongly enhanced at the resonance with its magnitude growing exponentially with an increase of the length of the system .",
    "this effect is an electromagnetic analogue of the charge accumulation in the case of electron tunneling , where it is known to cause interesting nonlinear phenomena.penley,azbel,goldman-1,goldman-2,goldman-3    an analytical solution of the single - defect problem allowed us to make predictions regarding the transport properties of the system with multiple randomly located defects .",
    "the most interesting of these is that the dynamical frequency of the defects , @xmath157 sets a high frequency boundary for the defect induced pass band , which does not move with increasing concentration of defects .",
    "numerical monte - carlo simulations confirmed this assumption and showed that the direct interaction between the atoms ( spatial dispersion ) does not affect resonance tunneling considerably , though it adds new interesting features to it .",
    "one of them is the behavior of the transmission in the vicinity of @xmath114 . in absence of the spatial dispersion ,",
    "the transmission at this point is exactly equal to zero , and remains small when the interaction is taken into account .",
    "the interesting fact revealed by the numerical analysis is that the transmission at @xmath114 decreases with an increase in the concentration of the defects and nearly approaches zero at concentrations as small as @xmath166 .",
    "this fact can be understood in light of the transfer matrix approach : if the frequency @xmath114 corresponds to the eigenvalue of the defect s transfer matrix , which significantly differs from one , the transmission will diminish strongly each time the wave encounters a defect site , regardless the order in which the defects are located .",
    "numerical results also demonstrated a transition between two transport regimes : one associated with resonance tunneling and the other occurring when the resonances spatially overlap and a pass band of extended states emerges .",
    "the transition occurs when the average distance between the defects becomes equal to the localization length of the single local state . at the same time",
    "the collective localization length at the peak transmission frequency , characterizing the transport properties of the entire chain , becomes equal to the total length of the system .",
    "this result assumes the linear dependence of this collective localization length upon concentration , which we directly confirm for small concentrations .",
    "numerical results also showed that the width of the resonance , which develops into a pass band with an increase in concentration , does not manifest any transformation when the character of transport changes .",
    "the concentration dependence of the width was found to be extremely well described by a power law with an exponent approximately equal to @xmath167 .",
    "the nature of this behavior awaits an explanation .",
    "in this appendix we develop invariant embedding approach to transfer - matrix equations of a general form and deduce eqs .",
    "( [ tfroms])-([s_init ] ) used for monte - carlo calculations in our paper .",
    "consider a typical difference equation of the transfer - matrix method , @xmath168 with boundary conditions of a general form : @xmath169 here @xmath170 is a vector of an appropriate dimension that characterizes the state of the system at the @xmath3th site , @xmath66 is a respective transfer - matrix ; @xmath144 and @xmath145 are matrices of the same dimension as the transfer - matrix , together a with the vector @xmath171 they specify boundary conditions at the left and right boundaries of the system ( cites @xmath12 and @xmath137 respectively ) . the regular maxwell boundary conditions and the fixed ends boundary condition for polarization can be presented in the form eq .",
