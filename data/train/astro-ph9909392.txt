    "investigations of coronal magnetic fields extrapolated from photospheric magnetograms do not always show a relation of solar flares with the separatrices caused by magnetic null points ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , a more systematic spatial correlation between the locations of energy release in flares and the regions of strong variation of the field line connectivity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . such regions , called quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) , are thought to be the plausible places for the magnetic reconnection process ( @xcite ) .    in most of the coronal volume",
    "the quasi - static conditions are fulfilled , so that the magnetic field evolves through a sequence of force - free equilibria .",
    "these conditions , however , may easily break down in qsls , where due to a strong variation of the field line connectivity the rearrangement of the field lines during the evolution of the configuration may occur faster than in other places .",
    "this in turn implies a locally large acceleration of plasma and hence a locally unbalanced and enhanced lorentz force with corresponding concentrations of the current density .",
    "so ultimately the inertia of plasma may cause the formation of current layers in qsls .",
    "the importance of inertia in the current layers at the qsls is also followed from exact solutions of linearized mhd equations describing a quasi - static evolution of inhomogeneous magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss the difference between separatrix surfaces and qsls together with the primary definition of qsls . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the local geometrical properties of the magnetic connectivity are studied . the new geometrical measure for qsls",
    "is derived and compared with the old ones .",
    "contains an application of this theory to a model of flaring twisted configurations possessing a hamiltonian structure , which plays an important role in the formation of qsls .",
    "the conclusions are summerized in sec .  5 .",
    "the magnetic field lines in solar active regions normally connect domains of positive and negative polarity of the photospheric plane , say ,  @xmath0 .",
    "let the location of their footpoints in this plane be represented depending on the polarity by the radius - vector @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the connections of the footpoints by the field lines determine two mutually inverse mappings @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we shall simply use @xmath5 if we refer to aspects valid for both mappings .",
    "also the functional forms @xmath6 and @xmath7 will be used further for the mappings .",
    "the mapping @xmath5 is discontinuous at the footpoints of the field lines threading magnetic nulls in the corona or touching the photosphere , since the magnetic flux tubes enclosing such field lines are splitted at the nulls or at the touching points ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding discontinuities serve as indicators for the separatrix field lines and surfaces .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the coordinates @xmath8 in this case need not to be cartesian because the discontinuities are revealed in any system of coordinates irrespective of the metrics .",
    "however , with the help of the metrics or cartesian coordinates one can determine not only the genuine separatrices but also the qsls .",
    "the integrity of the flux tubes is preserved within the qsls and so the mapping @xmath5 remains continuous at the corresponding footpoints , but the shape of their cross - sections strongly change along the flux tubes .",
    "thus , instead of the true discontinuities in @xmath5 at the intersection of the genuine separatrices with the photosphere , there are continuous but rapid variations in @xmath5 at the photospheric cross - sections of qsls .",
    "these variations can only be detected by using the metrics , which enables us to measure and compare the distances between the footpoints in one polarity and corresponding footpoints in the other polarity . in this respect qsls and",
    "separatrices are qualitatively different objects .",
    "indeed , ignoring the above metrical information about @xmath5 and using a proper continuous change of coordinates , it is possible to eliminate the rapid variations in @xmath5 and thereby the qsls themselves , while the discontinuities of @xmath5 and hence the corresponding separatrices are not removable in this way .",
    "however , for physical processes with characteristic length scales much less than the qsl thickness such a qsl must be as important as a genuine separatrix .    for the determination of the qsls @xcite proposed to use the function ( called `` the norm '' ) @xmath9 or @xmath10 ,",
    "which in cartesian coordinates are @xmath11^{1/2 }   \\equiv n_{\\pm } \\ , .",
    "& &       \\label{n1 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it was suggested that @xmath12 at the footpoints of the field lines belonging to qsls and @xmath13 otherwise . yet",
    "this norm in application to different footpoints of the same field line yields generally different values @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which leads to an ambiguity in the determination of qsls .",
    "this disadvantage of the norm indicates that the adequate measure for qsls must be invariant to the choice of the mapping @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "below we find such a measure by analyzing geometrical properties of the field line connectivity .",
    "the mapping @xmath16 or @xmath17 is locally described by its differential @xmath18 or @xmath19 , respectively , which is a linear mapping from the plane tangent to the photosphere at one footpoint to a similar plane at the other footpoint .",
    "these differentials are represented by the corresponding , mutually inverse , jacobian matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 we assume hereafter that @xmath22 are measured in one cartesian system of coordinates covering the whole photospheric plane . eqs .",
    "( [ dpm ] ) and ( [ dmp ] ) show that it is sufficient to have only one of these matrices for a local description of the magnetic connectivity .",
    "an orthonormal vector basis @xmath23 in the tangent plane at some footpoint @xmath24 is generally mapped by @xmath18 into a non - orthonormal basis @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the corresponding tangent plane at @xmath28 ( figure [ f : tp]a ) .",
    "one can choose , however , a special orientation of @xmath23 such that the basis @xmath25 becomes orthogonal ( figure [ f : tp]b ) .",
    "indeed , let the angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , determine the directions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 with respect to the @xmath33-axis of the global cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the corresponding matrices of rotations .",
    "it follows then from figure [ f : tp]b that @xmath36 and @xmath37 or , in other words , @xmath38 it means that the two non - diagonal elements at the right hand side of ( [ diag ] ) must vanish .",
    "this condition can be satisfied by @xmath39 where the function @xmath40 determines the arguments of the complex values ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 this solution for @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be checked by substitution of ( [ dpm ] ) and the corresponding expressions for the rotation matrices in ( [ diag ] ) .",
    "other solutions are also possible but not of interest , since they are simply the result of mirror reflections about the directions given by ( [ gm ] ) and ( [ gp ] ) .    eqs .",
    "( [ diag])([zp ] ) and ( [ dpm ] ) yield @xmath43 which means that @xmath44 in the solution under consideration . by using these expressions and ( [ n1])([dpm ] )",
    "one can obtain @xmath45 thus the norm @xmath14 determines simply the length of the rectangular diagonal constructed on the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath46 ( figure [ f : tp]b ) .",
    "it is worth to determine similar characteristics for the reverse differential @xmath19 at @xmath47 . the simplest way to do",
    "this is just to change in ( [ gm])([mvm ] ) the superscripts @xmath48 on @xmath49 and the elements of @xmath50 ( [ dpm ] ) to the corresponding elements of @xmath51 ( [ dmp ] ) .",
    "then we obtain for the complex values similar to ( [ zm ] ) and ( [ zp ] ) @xmath52/\\delta_{+ } \\equiv \\bar{\\xi}/\\delta_{+ } ,        \\label{tx } \\\\",
    "\\tilde{\\zeta } & = & [ d - a-{\\rm i}\\ , ( b+c)]/\\delta_{+ } \\equiv -\\zeta/\\delta_{+ } ,      \\label{tz }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding the following equations for the angles : @xmath53 they show that the orthonormal basis @xmath54 corresponding to this solution is turned on @xmath55 with respect to the basis @xmath56 and the same is valid for @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( figure [ f : tp]b , c ) . in application to ( [ mum ] ) and ( [ mvm ] )",
    "the considered transformation gives @xmath59 so the norm in the negative polarity at the footpoint @xmath60 is @xmath61 this consideration shows that the determination of qsls by means of the norms @xmath14 and @xmath15 must really lead to different results if @xmath62 . combining of these results in order to find the `` proper '' qsl is in fact equivalent to finding only in the positive polarity the regions where the functions @xmath14 and @xmath63 acquire anomalously large values . yet",
    "the simultaneous using of two different functions for characterizing qsls does not look as a theoretically well - founded approach .",
    "one can resolve this difficulty by noticing , first , that the mapping @xmath5 can locally be described by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where only @xmath64 and @xmath66 determine the value of footpoint displacements , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 define their directions .",
    "so it would be natural if the required characteristics is a function of @xmath67 and @xmath65 only .",
    "we think that the ratio @xmath68 is a more suitable quantity for describing qsls than the considered above norm .",
    "according to ( [ mup ] ) and ( [ mvp ] ) ( see also figure [ f : tp]b , c ) it coincides with the ratio @xmath69 and thereby characterizes the magnetic connectivity itself rather than one of the mappings @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "it determines the degree of flattening of the elementary flux tubes at their photospheric ends ( see shaded regions in figure [ f : tp]b , c ) , so the tubes characterized by extremely high values of this quantity should be referred to as qsl . by using ( [ zm])([mvm ] ) one can derive that @xmath70 which shows that @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "it is seen from ( [ n3 ] ) and ( [ q ] ) that @xmath73 is simply a product of the norms @xmath14 and @xmath15 calculated at the opposite ends of the field lines .",
    "geometrically , the value @xmath73 is the ratio of the square of quadrat with the side @xmath14 to the square of the rectangular based on the vectors @xmath74 and @xmath46 , because @xmath75 .",
    "note also that @xmath76 , since @xmath14 is the length of the diagonal in this rectangular .",
    "the expression for @xmath73 has an elegant form , invariant to the change @xmath77 and simpler than ( [ ar ] ) , so it is reasonable to define :    one can see from ( [ q ] ) that if the determinant @xmath78 varies in the photospheric plane as strong as @xmath14 , the qsls defined with the help of @xmath73 or @xmath14 have to be different , otherwise they must be approximately the same .    some comments should also be added on another characteristics for determining qsls , namely , on the so - called differential flux volume @xmath79 in which the integration is carried out along the corresponding field line .",
    "this value has appeared in the analysis of current sheet formations along separatrix surfaces in quasi - static evolutions of @xmath80d magnetic configurations ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been used ( under the name `` delay function '' ) for studying 3d magnetic topology caused by the presence of null points ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have shown that strong spatial variations of @xmath81 may cause a similar formation of current layers in 3d magnetic fields .",
    "so it seems natural at first sight to use this value for characterizing qsls .",
    "however , if one fixes the footpoints of the magnetic field lines in a given configuration and exposes the coronal volume to a smooth deformation , then @xmath81 will be changed depending on such a deformation , while the field line connectivity will remain the same .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath73 as a measure of the field line connectivity is better than @xmath81 , although this does not reduce the value of @xmath81 in understanding of the above mentioned current sheet formation .",
    "the topology of a twisted magnetic configuration provides important clues for understanding sigmoid - like flares ( @xcite ,  b ) .",
    "such a configuration can be modeled by a force - free circular flux tube with total current @xmath82 , which is embedded into potential field produced by a pair of magnetic charges @xmath83 , @xmath84 and a line current @xmath85 ( figure [ schm ] ) .",
    "the charges are on a distance @xmath86 from each other and lie together with the current @xmath85 on the axis of symmetry of the configuration , which is on the depth @xmath87 below the photospheric plane @xmath0 . below this plane the sources and their fields have no a real physical meaning : they are used only to construct the proper magnetic field in the corona .",
    "the photospheric vertical component of this field and current density of the flux tube can be considered a posteriori as the corresponding boundary conditions for the resulting configuration .",
    "the construction of this magnetic field excludes the existence of any null point in our model , so the topology of the coronal field may be non - trivial only due to the presence of the so - called bald patches ( bps , see @xcite ) , which are the segments of the photospheric inversion line ( il ) where the coronal field lines touch the photosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the separatrices , if present , consist of only the field lines starting at the bps .",
    "the full topological analysis of the field then reduces to determining the bps and their associated separatrices .",
    "such an analysis has been made by @xcite for the scenario in which the major radius @xmath88 of the flux tube ( figure [ schm ] ) grows , starting from @xmath89 , while the intensity and positions of sub - photospheric sources remain constant .",
    "it was found that the bp appears first at some @xmath90 and then grows in size with increasing  @xmath88 . after reaching some @xmath91 the bp bifurcates at the center of the configuration to give birth to a generalized separator field line at the intersection of two separatrix surfaces .",
    "the gap between bifurcated parts of bp grows with @xmath88 , while these parts shrink and eventually disappear at some @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , where a transition to a topologically simple arcade - like configuration occurs .    in spite of this simplicity ,",
    "the resulting magnetic field might have qsls , which are as important as the genuine separatrices under the appropriate conditions .",
    "the aim of the further consideration is to check this possibility by using the above theory of qsls for the same scenario of the magnetic field evolution .",
    "here we use the cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath94 , whose axis is directed along @xmath95 and where @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the angle between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the corresponding unit vector . due to the axial symmetry about the",
    "line current @xmath95 ( figure [ schm ] ) the magnetic field can be written as @xmath102 which , in particular , gives @xmath103 it is convenient in our case to use @xmath98 for parameterizing field lines , so that their equation @xmath104 with @xmath105 yield @xmath106 these are the components of the field line equation along @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , while the component along @xmath101 requires @xmath109 along the field lines , which is simply a consequence of ( [ fle1])([fle2 ] ) .",
    "the axial symmetry allows also to write the @xmath33-component of the current density @xmath110 as @xmath111 from where after introducing the whole current @xmath112 through the perpendicular to the @xmath33-axis disc of radius @xmath113 one can obtain @xmath114 here we put @xmath115 , since the current lines lie on magnetic surfaces @xmath116 ( note that in our model @xmath117 and @xmath118 according to eq .",
    "( [ bax ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , this is also valid in more general case of magnetostatic configurations . by using ( [ btg ] ) and normalizing the coordinates as @xmath119 , @xmath120 with subsequent omitting of the tilde",
    ", one can transform ( [ fle1])([fle2 ] ) to the following one - dimensional and autonomous hamiltonian system : @xmath121 where @xmath98 is a time - like variable and instead of @xmath113 the new momentum - like variable @xmath122 is introduced together with the hamiltonian function @xmath123 the hamiltonian structure is revealed here only with the help of the axial symmetry and the magnetostatic condition @xmath115 , so it must be inherent to both force - free and magnetostatic fields having the axial symmetry .",
    "the analogous fact has been early established by @xcite for toroidal geometry but we derived it in a much simpler way by using a different hamiltonian and canonical variables .",
    "this structure provides a powerful tool for investigating the geometry of magnetic field lines in our model .",

    "the toroidal field @xmath151 is approximately homogeneous in the vicinity of the tube .",
    "this enables us to relate the radius @xmath134 to the total number @xmath152 of field line turns in the tube as follows : @xmath153 in the above mentioned scenario of the emerging flux tube only the equilibrium current @xmath82 and minor radius @xmath134 change with growing major radius @xmath88 according to ( [ ieq ] ) and ( [ nt ] ) , while @xmath152 and the other parameters of the model @xmath83 , @xmath87 , @xmath154 , and @xmath95 remain constant . at each moment",

    "the hamiltonian in this region has a hyperbolic critical point , which is in fact the x - point of the poloidal magnetic field .",

    "this portrait is a result of projection @xmath160 of several magnetic field lines .",

    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ hp ] ) or more general eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , one can obtain another useful interpretation of the portrait , namely , as a cross - section @xmath162 of the corresponding poloidal magnetic surfaces @xmath116 shown in the coordinates @xmath163 .",
    "these coordinates differ from cartesian ones only by the logarithmic transformation ( @xmath164 ) of the vertical axis , so figure [ f : phfl ] yields a rather realistic information about the shape of these surfaces .",
    "the important property of autonomous hamiltonian systems is the conservation of the corresponding phase volume in the phase flow . in our case",
    "this volume is two - dimensional , so the area of the plane @xmath163 is conserved in such a flow .",
    "this property in combination with the presence of the hyperbolic critical point , provides a mechanism of the qsl formation in our configuration .",
    "indeed , any cross - section of an elementary flux tube corresponds to an area in the phase plane and the variation of this cross - section along such a tube corresponds to an evolution of the appropriate phase area due to the phase flow . given a small circle near one of the separatrices on the phase portrait as an initial area ,",
    "its area - conserving evolution with the divergent character of the phase flow near the critical point will inevitably cause a stretching and compressing of this area across and along , respectively , the direction of the flow ( see figure [ f : phfl ] ) .",
    "this means that the elementary flux tubes starting nearby the poloidal separatrix surfaces have to experience especially strong flattening , which is a characteristic feature of the field lines in qsl .",
    "one can also expect from the above consideration that the maximal value of @xmath165 is achieved at the field line passing through the x - point of poloidal magnetic field .",

    "the dependence @xmath178 at several different values of @xmath95 ( see figure ( [ f : qx ] ) ) suggests that the qsl has to appear in the twisted configuration when the major radius of the flux tube reaches @xmath179 .",

    "contrary to the so - called norm @xmath180 proposed previously by @xcite , the new measure @xmath73 yields the same results for both positive and negative magnetic polarities on the photosphere . in other words , @xmath73 characterizes the magnetic connectivity itself rather than the corresponding field line mappings ( from positive to negative polarity or vice versa ) .",
    "the old and new measures are related by a very simple formula @xmath181 , in which @xmath182 is the jacobian of the corresponding field line mapping .",
    "thus , if @xmath182 varies on the photosphere as strong as @xmath180 , the new and old measure must yield different locations for qsls .",

    "it has been demonstrated that the appearance of qsls in such a model is related with the hamiltonian structure of the modeling magnetic field : the conservation of the phase area in the corresponding phase flow and the presence of the x - point in the poloidal magnetic field provides the mechanism for the formation of qsls in this configuration .",
    "the results of computations of @xmath73 suggest that the qsl must be formed in such a configuration approximately after that the genuine separatrix surfaces disappear when the twisted flux tube emerges high enough into the corona .",
