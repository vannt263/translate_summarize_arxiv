    "it is being increasingly realized by those engaged in the search for the supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite that the principle of r - parity conservation , assumed to be sacrosanct in the prevalent search strategies , is not inviolable in practice .",
    "the r - parity of a particle is defined as @xmath3 , and can be violated if either baryon ( b ) or lepton ( l ) number is not conserved in nature , a fact perfectly compatible with the non observation of proton decay . under r - parity violation",
    "the phenomenology changes considerably@xcite , the most important consequence is that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can decay now .",
    "however , the way in which r - parity can be violated is not unique . different types of r - parity violating interaction terms can be written down , leading to different observable predictions .",
    "in addition , r - parity can be violated spontaneously , instead of explicitly , whence another class of interesting effects are expected @xcite . if the phenomenology of r - parity breaking has to be understood , and the consequent modifications in the current search strategies have to be effectively implemented , then it is quite important to explore the full implication of each possible r - breaking scheme .",
    "the r - conserving part of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is specified by the superpotential @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are generation indices ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 are su(2 ) indices ; and @xmath11 is a completely antisymmetric @xmath12 matrix , with @xmath13 .",

    "even though we have considered the experimental fact that @xmath57gev and @xmath58mev@xcite , the mixing between charginos and charged leptons may give an important contribution to the rare b decays such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "fcnc studies have found kaon physics as their best research ground so far . however ,",
    "the achievements in b - physics make b - mesons the new challenging frontier in the study of fcnc phenomena . at least some of the rare b - processes which are induced by the fcnc transitions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are within the reach of present machines .",
    "needless to say , the test of such rare b - processes presents a probe of the validity of crucial ingredients of the standard model ( sm ) and , possibly of the existence of new physics beyond the sm at the low energy scale .",

    "the method of the effective hamiltonian theory was first used by ref@xcite and has been developed over the last years@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is a two step program , starting with an operator product expansion ( ope ) and performing a renormalization group equation ( rge ) analysis afterwards .",
    "the derivation starts as follows : if the kinematics of the decay are of the kind that the masses of the internal particles @xmath136 are much larger than the external momentum @xmath137 : @xmath138 , then the heavy particles can be integrated out .",
    "this concept takes a concrete form with the functional integral formalism .",
    "it means that the heavy particles are removed as dynamical degrees of freedom from the theory , hence their fields do not appear in the ( effective ) lagrangian anymore .",
    "their residual effect lies in the generated effective vertices . in this way an effective low energy theory can be constructed from the full theory . in the framework of the standard model ,",
    "strong interactions are known to give sizable contributions to fcnc processes , the inclusion of the qcd corrections increases the electroweak rate by about a factor two for @xmath139 process , and enhances the rate about 30% for @xmath60 transition@xcite .",
