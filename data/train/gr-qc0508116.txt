    "<S> brane - world models offer the possibility of explaining the late acceleration of the universe via infra - red modifications to general relativity , rather than a dark energy field . </S>",
    "<S> however , one also expects ultra - violet modifications to general relativity , when high - energy stringy effects in the early universe begin to grow . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the dgp brane - world model via an ultra - violet modification , in the form of a gauss - bonnet term in the bulk action . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of infra - red and ultra - violet modifications produces an intriguing cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the dgp feature of late - time acceleration without dark energy is preserved , but there is an entirely new feature  there is no infinite - temperature big bang in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> the universe starts with finite density and pressure , from a  sudden \" curvature singularity . </S>"
