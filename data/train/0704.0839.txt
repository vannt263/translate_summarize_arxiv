    "these operations may be viewed as a result of the so - called _ dequantization _ of the classical arithmetic operations that underlies the _ patchworking _ construction , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these tropical operations allow one to define tropical laurent polynomials .",
    "namely , a tropical laurent polynomial is a function @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the scalar product , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and only finitely many coefficients @xmath18 are non - zero ( i.e. not @xmath19 ) .",
    "affine - linear functions with integer slopes ( for brevity we call them simply _ affine functions _ ) form an important subcollection of all laurent polynomials .",
    "namely , these are such functions @xmath13 that both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are tropical laurent polynomials .",
    "we equip @xmath22 with the euclidean topology .",
    "let @xmath23 be an open set .",
    "a continuous function @xmath24 is called _ regular _ if its restriction to @xmath25 coincides with a restriction of some tropical laurent polynomial to @xmath25 .",

    "any subset @xmath29 gets an induced regular sheaf @xmath30 by restriction . for our purposes",
    "we restrict our attention only to the case when @xmath31 is a polyhedral complex , i.e. when @xmath31 is the closure of a union of convex polyhedra ( possibly unbounded ) in @xmath32 such that the intersection of any number of such polyhedra is their common face .",
    "we say that @xmath31 is an @xmath33-dimensional polyhedral complex if it is obtained from a union of @xmath33-dimensional polyhedra .",
    "these polyhedra are called the _ facets _ of @xmath31 .",

    "to each facet of @xmath44 we may associate a natural number , called its _ weight _ ( or degree ) . to do this we choose a  zero point \" @xmath41 inside such a facet .",
    "we say that @xmath41 is a  simple zero \" for @xmath20 if for any local decomposition into a sum ( i.e. the tropical product ) of regular function @xmath46 on @xmath36 near @xmath41 we have either @xmath47 or @xmath48 affine ( i.e. without a  zero \" ) .",

    "we view @xmath62 as a  tropical closure \" of the set - theoretical graph @xmath56 .",
    "note that we have a map @xmath63 .",
    "we set @xmath64 to be the result of the _ tropical modification _",
    "@xmath65 along the regular function @xmath20 .",
    "the locus @xmath60 is called the _ center _ of tropical modification .    the weights of the facets of @xmath66 supplies us with some inconvenience as they should be incorporated in the definition of the regular sheaf @xmath67 on @xmath66 .",
    "namely , the affine functions defined by @xmath67 on a facet of weight @xmath68 should contain the group of functions that come as restrictions to this facet of the affine functions on @xmath69 as a subgroup of index @xmath68 .",
    "sometimes one can get rid of the weights of @xmath66 by a reparameterization with the help of a map @xmath70 that is given by locally linear maps in the corresponding charts .",
    "indeed , the restriction of @xmath71 to a facet is locally given by a linear function between two @xmath33-dimensional affine - linear spaces defined over @xmath72 .",
    "if its determinant equals to @xmath68 then the push - forward of @xmath73 supplies an extension of @xmath67 required by the weights .",
    "note however that if @xmath74 then the converse map is not defined over @xmath72 and thus is not given by elements of @xmath67 .",
    "tropical modifications give the basic equivalence relation in tropical geometry .",
    "it can be shown that if we start from @xmath75 and do a number of tropical modifications on it then the result is a @xmath33-dimensional polyhedral complex @xmath76 that satisfies to the following _ balancing property _ ( cf .",

    "set @xmath91 to be the product of @xmath92 and the index of the subgroup @xmath93 .",
    "we say that @xmath94 is _ balanced _",
    "if for any choice of @xmath84 , @xmath90 and a small generic @xmath95 the sum @xmath96 is independent of @xmath95 .",
    "we say that @xmath79 is _ simply balanced _ if in addition for every @xmath97 we can find @xmath90 and @xmath95 so that @xmath98 , @xmath99 and for every small @xmath95 there exists an affine hyperplane @xmath100 such that the intersection @xmath101 sits entirely on one side of @xmath102 in @xmath103 while the intersection @xmath104 is a point .    a topological space @xmath31 enhanced with a sheaf of tropical functions @xmath30 is called a ( smooth ) tropical variety of dimension @xmath33 if for every @xmath105 there exist an open set @xmath106 and an open set @xmath36 in a simply balanced polyhedral complex @xmath107 such that the restrictions @xmath108 and @xmath109 are isomorphic .",
    "tropical varieties are considered up to the equivalence generated by tropical modifications .",
    "it can be shown that a smooth tropical variety of dimension @xmath33 can be locally obtained from @xmath75 by a sequence of tropical modifications centered at smooth tropical varieties of dimension @xmath45 .",
    "this follows from the following proposition .",
    "any @xmath33-dimensional simply balanced polyhedral complex @xmath110 can be obtained from @xmath75 by a sequence of consecutive tropical modifications whose centers are simply balanced @xmath45-dimensional polyhedral complexes .",
    "we prove this proposition inductively by @xmath0 . without the loss of genericity we may assume that @xmath31 is a fan , i.e. each convex polyhedron of @xmath31 is a cone centered at the origin .    the base of the induction , when @xmath111 , is trivial . if @xmath112 let us take a @xmath113-dimensional affine - linear subspace @xmath114 given by property [ prop - b ] .",
    "choose a linear projection @xmath115 defined over @xmath72 and such that @xmath116 is a line contained in @xmath90 .",
    "the image @xmath117 is a @xmath33-dimensional polyhedral complex since @xmath90 is transversal to some facets of @xmath31 .",
    "we claim that @xmath118 is a tropical modification once we identify @xmath32 and @xmath119 .",
    "the center of this modification is the locus @xmath120 here we use the dimension in the usual topological sense .",
    "note that the @xmath45-dimensional complex @xmath121 is simply balanced , existence of the needed @xmath113-dimensional affine - linear spaces follows from the fact that @xmath110 is simply balanced .    to justify our claim",
    "we note that near any point @xmath122 the subcomplex @xmath123 obtained as the ( euclidean topology ) closure of @xmath124 is a ( set - theoretical ) graph of a convex function .",
    "this , once again , follows from the fact that @xmath110 is simply balanced , this time applied to the points in the facets on @xmath125 .",
    "thus it gives a regular tropical function @xmath20 and it remains only to show that the the weight of any facet of @xmath126 is 1 .",
    "but this follows , in turn , from the balancing condition at @xmath127 .",
    "the definition of tropical variety is especially easy in dimension 1 .",
    "tropical modifications take a graph into a graph ( with arbitrary valence of its vertices ) and the tropical structure carried by the sheaf @xmath30 amounts to a complete metric on the complement of the set of 1-valent vertices of the graph @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , each 1-valent vertex of a tropical curve @xmath31 is adjacent to an edge of infinite length .",
    "a tropical modification allows one to contract such an edge or to attach it at any point of @xmath31 other than a 1-valent vertex .",
    "if we have a finite collection of marked points on @xmath31 then by passing to an equivalent model if needed we may assume that the set of marked points coincides with the set of 1-valent vertices .",
    "( of course , if @xmath31 is a tree then we have to have at least two marked points to make such assumption . )",
    "the _ genus _ of a tropical curve @xmath31 is @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the set of all tropical curves @xmath31 of genus @xmath47 with @xmath0 distinct marked points .",
    "fixing a combinatorial type of a graph @xmath130 with @xmath0 marked leaves defines a subset @xmath131 consisting of marked tropical curves with this combinatorics .",
    "a length of any non - leaf edge of @xmath130 defines a real - valued function on @xmath132 .",
    "such functions are called _ edge - length functions_. to avoid difficulties caused by self - automorphisms of @xmath31 from now on we restrict our attention to the case @xmath133 .",
    "the _ combinatorial type _ of a tropical curve @xmath31 is its equivalence class up to homeomorphisms respecting the markings .",
    "combinatorial types partite the set @xmath134 into disjoint subsets .",
    "the edge - length functions define the structure of the polyhedral cone @xmath135 in each of those subsets ( as the lengths have to be positive ) .",
    "the number @xmath136 here is the number of the bounded ( non - leaf ) edges in @xmath31 . by the euler characteristic reasoning it is equal to @xmath1 if @xmath31 is ( 1- and ) 3-valent",
    ", it is smaller if @xmath31 has vertices of higher valence .",
    "furthermore , any face of the polyhedral cone @xmath135 coincides with the cone corresponding to another combinatorial type , the one where we contract some of the edges of @xmath31 to points .",
    "this gives the adjacency ( fan - like ) structure on @xmath137 , so @xmath137 is a ( non - compact ) polyhedral complex . in particular , it is a topological space .",
    "[ thm1 ] the set @xmath137 for @xmath138 admits the structure of an @xmath139-dimensional tropical variety such that the edge - length functions are regular within each combinatorial type .",
    "furthermore , the space @xmath137 can be tropically embedded in @xmath140 for some @xmath141 ( i.e. @xmath137 can be presented as a simply balanced complex ) .",
    "this theorem is trivial for @xmath142 as @xmath143 is a point .",
    "otherwise , any two disjoint ordered pairs of marked points can be used to define a global regular function on @xmath137 with values in @xmath144 .",
    "namely , each such ordered pair defines the oriented path on the tropical curve @xmath31 connecting the corresponding marked points .",
    "these paths can be embedded .    since the two pairs of marked points",
    "are disjoint the intersection of the two corresponding paths has to have finite length .",
    "we take this length with the positive sign if the orientations agree and with the negative sign otherwise .",
    "this defines a function on @xmath137 .",
    "we call such functions the _ double ratio _ functions",
    ".    take all possible disjoint pairs of marked points and use them as coordinates for our embedding @xmath145 where @xmath141 is the number of all possible decompositions of @xmath0 into two disjoint pairs .",
    "the theorem now follows from the following two lemmas .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , each coordinate in @xmath140 depends not only on the choice of two disjoint pairs of marked points but also on the order of points in each pair .",
    "however , changing the order in one of the pairs only reverses the sign of the double ratio .",
    "taking an extra coordinate for such a change of order would be redundant .",
    "indeed , for any balanced complex @xmath146 and any affine - linear function @xmath147 with an integer slope the graph of @xmath148 is a balanced complex in @xmath149 isomorphic to the initial complex @xmath79 .",
    "the map @xmath150 is a topological embedding .",
    "first , let us prove that @xmath150 is an embedding .",
    "the combinatorial type of @xmath31 is determined by the set of the coordinates that do not vanish on @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , any non - leaf edge @xmath84 of the tree @xmath31 separates the leaves ( i.e. the set of markings ) into two classes corresponding to the components of @xmath151 .",
    "let us take a coordinate in @xmath32 that corresponds to four marking points ( union of the two disjoint pairs ) such that two of these points belong to one class and two to the other class .",
    "we call such a coordinate an _ @xmath84-compatible coordinate_. note that an @xmath84-compatible coordinate vanishes on @xmath31 if and only if the pairs of markings defined by the coordinate agree with the pairs defined by the classes",
    ".    this observation suffices to reconstruct the combinatorial type of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the length of @xmath84 equals to the minimal non - zero absolute value of the @xmath84-compatible coordinates .",
    "this implies that @xmath150 is an embedding .    the image @xmath152 is a simply balanced complex in @xmath140 .",
    "this is a condition on codimension 1 faces of @xmath137 .",
    "first we shall check it for the case @xmath153 .",
    "there are three ways to split the four marking points into two disjoint pairs .",
    "accordingly , there are three combinatorial types of 3-valent trees with three marked leaves .",
    "thus our space @xmath154 is homeomorphic to the _ tripod _ , or the  interior \" of the letter @xmath79 , see figure [ m04 ] .",
    "each ray of this tripod correspond to a combinatorial type of a 3-valent tree with 4 leaves while the vertex correspond to the 4-valent tree .",
    "up to the sign we have the total of three double ratios for @xmath153 .",
    "let us e.g. take those defined by the following ordered pairs : @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 each is vanishing on the corresponding ray of the tripod .",
    "let us parameterize each ray of the tripod by its only edge - length @xmath158 and compute the corresponding map to @xmath159 .",
    "we have the following embeddings on the three rays @xmath160 the sum of the primitive integer vectors parallel to the resulting directions is @xmath161 and thus @xmath162 is balanced .    in the case @xmath163 the codimension 1 faces of @xmath137 correspond to the combinatorial types of @xmath31 with a single 4-valent vertex . near a point inside of such face @xmath80",
    "the space @xmath137 looks like the product of @xmath154 and @xmath164 .",
    "the factor @xmath164 comes from the edge - lengths on @xmath80 ( its combinatorial type has @xmath165 bounded edges ) while the factor @xmath154 comes from perturbations of the 4-valent vertex ( which result in a new bounded edge in one of the three possible combinatorial types of the result ) .",
    "we have a well - defined map from the union @xmath166 of the @xmath80-adjacent facets to @xmath80 by contracting the new edge to a point .",
    "note that the edge - length functions exhibit @xmath80 as the positive quadrant in @xmath164 . furthermore , in the combinatorial type of @xmath80 we may choose 4 leaves such that contracting all other leaves will take place outside of the 4-valent vertex ( see figure [ contraction4 ] ) .",
    "this contraction defines a map @xmath167 .",
    "the lemma now follows from the observation that the resulting decomposition into @xmath168 agrees with the double ratio functions . indeed ,",
    "note that the complement of the 4-valent vertex for a curve in the combinatorial type @xmath80 is composed of four components .",
    "if the double ratio is such that its four markings are in one - to - one correspondence with these components then at @xmath166 it coincides with sum of the pull - back of the corresponding double ratio in @xmath80 with the pull - back of the corresponding double ratio in @xmath154 .",
    "if one of the four components is lacking a marking from the double ratio @xmath169 then @xmath170 coincides with the corresponding pull - back from @xmath80 .",
    "the functions @xmath171 from @xcite do not define regular functions on @xmath137 , contrary to what is written in @xcite .",
    "these functions were a result of an erroneous simplification of the double ratio functions .",
    "but these functions can not be regular as they are always positive and proposition 5.12 of @xcite is not correct .",
    "even the projectivization of the embedding is not a balanced complex already for @xmath172 .",
    "one should use the ( non - simplified ) double ratios instead .",
    "clearly , the space @xmath137 is non compact .",
    "however it is easy to compactify it by allowing the lengths of bounded edges to assume infinite values .",
    "let @xmath173 be the space of connected trees with @xmath0 ( marked ) leaves such that each edge of this tree is assigned a length @xmath174 so that each leaf has length necessarily equal to @xmath175 .",
    "the space @xmath173 is a smooth compact tropical variety .    to verify that @xmath173 is smooth near a point @xmath41 at the boundary @xmath176 we need to examine those double ratios that are equal to @xmath177 at @xmath41 .",
    "there we use only those signs that result in @xmath19 do that the map takes values in @xmath178 .",
    "note that the compactification @xmath179 corresponds to the deligne - mumford compactification in the complex case as under the 1-parametric family collapse of a riemannian surface to a tropical curve the tropical length of an edge corresponds to the rate of growth of the complex modulus of the holomorphic annulus collapsing to that edge .",
    "furthermore , similarly to the complex story the infinite edges decompose a tropical curve into components ( where the non - leaf edges are finite ) .",
    "any tropical map from an infinite edge which is bounded would have to be constant and thus the image would have to split as a union of several tropical curves in the target .",
    "such decompositions were used by gathmann and markwig in their deduction of the tropical wdvv equation in @xmath180 , see @xcite .",
    "note that we do have the forgetting maps @xmath181 for @xmath182 by contracting the leaf with the @xmath97-marking .",
    "this map is sometimes called the _ universal",
    "curve_. each marking @xmath183 defines a section @xmath184 of @xmath185 .",
    "the conormal bundle to @xmath184 defines the @xmath186-class in complex geometry ( to avoid ambiguity we take @xmath187 ) .",
    "this notion can be adapted to our tropical setup .",
    "recall that so far our choice of tropical models in their equivalence class was such that the leaves of the tropical curves were in 1 - 1 correspondence with the markings . for this choice",
    "we have the images @xmath188 contained in the boundary part of @xmath189 .",
    "this presentation is compatible with the point of view when we think about line bundles in tropical geometry to be given by @xmath190 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the base of the bundle and @xmath191 is the sheaf of  non - vanishing \" tropical regular functions .",
    "such functions are given in the charts to @xmath140 by affine - linear functions with integer slopes , see @xcite .",
    "( recall that @xmath192 is an honest group with respect to tropical multiplication , i.e. the classical addition . )",
    "however , the following alternative construction allows one to obtain the @xmath2-classes more geometrically ( as we ll illustrate in an example in the next section ) .",
    "this approach is based on contracting the leaves marked by number @xmath33 .    the canonical class of a tropical curve is supported at its vertices ,",
    "namely we take each vertex with the multiplicity equal to its valence minus 2 , cf .",
    "furthermore , the cotangent bundle near a 3-valent vertex point can be viewed as a neighborhood of the origin for the line given by the tropical polynomial @xmath193 in @xmath180 , so the @xmath194 self - intersection of the line gives the required multiplicity for the canonical class at any 3-valent vertex .",
    "thus we can use the intersections with the corresponding codimension 1 faces in @xmath137 to define the @xmath2-classes there .",
    "in other words , tropical @xmath2-classes will be supported on the @xmath195-dimensional faces in @xmath137 .",
    "namely , for a @xmath186-class we have to collect those codimension 1 faces in @xmath137 whose only 4-valent vertex is adjacent to the leaf marked by @xmath33 . after a contraction of this leaf",
    "we get a 3-valent vertex , thus the multiplicity of every face in a @xmath2-divisor is 1 .",
    "we arrive to the following definition .",
    "the tropical @xmath186-divisor @xmath196 is the union of those @xmath195-dimensional faces that correspond to tropical curves with a 4-valent vertex adjacent to the leaf marked by @xmath33 , @xmath197 .",
    "each such face is taken with the multiplicity 1 .",
    "the subcomplex @xmath198 is a divisor , i.e. satisfies the balancing condition .",
    "recall that the balancing condition is a condition at @xmath199-dimensional faces . in @xmath137",
    "there are two types of such faces , one corresponding to tropical curves with two 4-valent vertices and one corresponding to a tropical curve with a 5-valent vertex .    near the faces of the first type",
    "the moduli space @xmath137 is locally a product of two copies of @xmath154 and @xmath200 .",
    "the @xmath201-divisor is a product of @xmath200 , one copy of @xmath154 and the central ( 3-valent ) point in the other copy of @xmath154 ( this is the point corresponding to the 4-valent vertex adjacent to the leaf marked by @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus the balancing condition holds trivially in this case .    near the faces of the second type",
    "the moduli space @xmath137 is locally a product of @xmath172 and @xmath200 . as in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] each double ratio decomposes to the sum of the corresponding double ration in @xmath172 ( perhaps trivial if two of the markings for the double ratio correspond to the same edge adjacent to the 5-valent vertex ) and an affine - linear function in @xmath200 .",
    "thus it suffices to check only the balancing condition for the @xmath201-divisors in @xmath172 .",
    "this example is considered in details in the next section .",
    "the balancing condition there follows from proposition [ bal5 ] .",
    "conjecturally , the tropical @xmath201-divisors are limits of some natural representatives of the divisors for the complex @xmath2-classes under the collapse of the complex moduli space onto the corresponding tropical moduli space @xmath137 .",
    "note that our choice for the tropical @xmath201-divisor is not contained in the boundary @xmath202 ( cf . the calculus of the complex boundary classes in @xcite ) , but comes as a closure of a divisor in @xmath137 .",
    "we have already described the moduli space @xmath154 as the tripod of figure [ m04 ] .",
    "it has only one @xmath161-dimensional face @xmath204 . this point ( considered as a divisor )",
    "coincides with the divisors @xmath205 .",
    "the description of @xmath172 is somewhat more interesting .",
    "there are 15 combinatorial types of 3-valent trees with 5 marked leaves .",
    "if we forget about the markings there is only one homeomorphism class for such a curve ( see figure [ tree5 ] ) . to get the number of non - isomorphic markings we take the number all possible reordering of vertices ( equal to @xmath206 ) and divide by @xmath207 as there is an 8-fold symmetry of reordering",
    "indeed there is one symmetry interchanging the left two leaves , one interchanging the right two leaves and the central symmetry around the central leave of the 3-valent tree on top of figure [ tree5 ] .",
    "thus the space @xmath172 is a union of 15 quadrants @xmath208 .",
    "these quadrants are attached along the rays which correspond to the combinatorial types of curves with one 4-valent vertex .",
    "such curves also have one 3-valent vertex which is adjacent to two leaves and the only bounded edge of the curve , see the bottom of figure [ tree5 ] .",
    "such combinatorial types are determined by the markings of the two leaves emanating from the 3-valent vertex .",
    "thus we have a total of @xmath209 of such rays .",
    "the two boundary edges of the quadrant correspond to contractions of the bounded edges of the combinatorial type as shown on figure [ tree5 ] . the global picture of adjacency of quadrants and rays",
    "is shown on figure [ m05 ] where the reader may recognize the well - known _ petersen graph _ , cf . the related tropical grassmannian picture in @xcite .",
    "vertices of this graph correspond to the rays of @xmath172 while the edges correspond to the quadrants .",
    "thus the whole picture may be interpreted as the link of the only vertex @xmath210 ( the point @xmath211 corresponds to the tree with a 5-valent vertex adjacent to all the leaves ) .    to locate the @xmath198-divisor we recall that the @xmath33th leaf has to be adjacent to a 4-valent vertex if it appears in @xmath198 .",
    "this means that @xmath198 consists of 6 rays that are marked by pairs not containing @xmath33 .",
    "since the whole @xmath172 is @xmath213-symmetric it suffices to check the balancing condition only for @xmath214 .",
    "the embedding @xmath215 is given by the double ratios , so it suffices to check that for each double ratio function the sum of its gradients on the six rays of @xmath214 vanishes .",
    "if the double ratio is determined by two pairs disjoint from the marking 1 , e.g. by @xmath216 then its restriction onto the six rays of @xmath214 is the same as its restriction to the three rays @xmath154 taken twice and thus balanced .",
    "namely its gradient is 1 on the rays @xmath217 and @xmath218 ; @xmath219 on the rays @xmath220 and @xmath221 ; and 0 on the rays @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "if the four markings of the double ratio contain the marking 1 then thanks to the symmetry we may assume that the double ratio is given by @xmath155 .",
    "it vanishes on the rays @xmath221 , @xmath218 , @xmath223 and @xmath220 ; it has gradient @xmath194 on the ray @xmath217 and the gradient @xmath219 on the ray @xmath222 .",
    "once again , the balancing condition holds .",
    "once again , we interpret the peterson graph as the link @xmath90 of the vertex @xmath210 .",
    "similarly , the link of the origin in @xmath154 consists of three points .",
    "thus @xmath90 is the union of the fibers of @xmath225 ( away from a neighborhood of infinity ) over these three points and four copies of a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath154 corresponding to the four sections @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 of the universal curve .",
