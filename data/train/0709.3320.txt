    "i would also like to thank the referees for helpful , detailed suggestions in particular with respect to defining local monodromy and simplifying some proofs .",
    "in this section we define what it means for a variety ( or stack ) to have the abelian monodromy extension ( ame ) property .",
    "we also make a few remarks about the definition and give an example .    all schemes are noetherian . by a variety",
    "we mean an integral , separated ( but possibly singular ) scheme of finite type defined over @xmath2 .",
    "by morphism we will always mean a regular morphism .",
    "a complete scheme is a scheme proper over @xmath56 and a compactification of a variety @xmath57 is a complete variety @xmath51 containing @xmath57 as an open dense subset .",
    "let @xmath57 be an open subvariety of a normal variety @xmath51 .",
    "next , consider an open subvariety @xmath0 of a normal variety @xmath1 together with a morphism @xmath58 . fix a",
    "connected , reduced , complete subscheme @xmath59 .",
    "we can always restrict to a smaller open subset @xmath54 if necessary so that @xmath54 is disjoint from @xmath60 as well as the singular locus of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath40 .",
    "since we can find a blowup @xmath61 so that @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are all simple , normal crossing divisors in @xmath29 we can assume that @xmath65 , @xmath45 and @xmath60 are all simple , normal crossing divisors .",
    "this means that around any point @xmath66 there exist local coordinates such that @xmath60 is given by @xmath67 and @xmath45 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "notice that we can choose @xmath0 so that this blowup leaves @xmath54 unchanged .",
    "now choose a small analytic neighbourhood @xmath69 of @xmath60 .",
    "one way to do this is to put a riemannian metric @xmath70 on @xmath1 and take @xmath71 then we can define the _ local monodromy around @xmath60 _ as the image @xmath72 since @xmath60 is connected @xmath73 is connected and so the image of @xmath74 is defined ( up to conjugation ) without having to choose a base point .",
    "there are three things to check to make sure local monodromy is well defined .",
    "the first is that local monodromy does not depend on the choice of @xmath69 . to see this note we identify @xmath75 as sitting inside its normal bundle ( which is a line bundle )",
    "this means that @xmath76 deformation retracts onto @xmath77 for any @xmath78 sufficiently small .",
    "thus @xmath79 and @xmath80 have isomorphic images in @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , since for any other metric @xmath82 we have @xmath83 for @xmath84 we see that this image does not depend on the metric",
    ".    now the images of @xmath85 are the same since the map @xmath86 induced by inclusion is surjective .",
    "thus @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the same image for sufficiently small @xmath89 .",
    "the second thing is that local monodromy does not depend on the choice of @xmath54 .",
    "this follows since if @xmath90 is ( in the analytic topology ) a dense , open subset then the map @xmath91 induced by the inclusion is surjective .",
    "similarly , @xmath92 is surjective and hence the images of @xmath93 are the same .    the third thing to check is that local monodromy does not depend on the choice of the blowup @xmath29 . to see this",
    "consider a blowup @xmath61 so that @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are also simple , normal crossing divisors .",
    "if you take a small neighbourhood @xmath69 of @xmath60 then @xmath94 is also a small neighbourhood of @xmath64 and then taking @xmath0 so that it avoids the blowup locus we get @xmath95 so that @xmath96 and hence the images of @xmath97 are the same",
    ".    most commonly we will take @xmath60 to be a point @xmath43 to obtain the local monodromy around @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath1 is complete , we can take @xmath60 to be all of @xmath1 to obtain the _ global monodromy of @xmath1 _ as the image of the induced map @xmath98 .",
    "the reason for this slightly strange terminology is that @xmath57 will often be a moduli space , for instance @xmath99 or @xmath46 , so that the image of @xmath98 can be identified with the usual notion of monodromy .",
    "for instance , @xmath100 ( the orbifold fundamental group ) is the mapping class group @xmath101 so the image of @xmath102 is the monodromy on @xmath103 of a fibre in the family of curves over @xmath54 corresponding to the morphism @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath104 so the image of @xmath105 induced by a morphism @xmath48 is the monodromy on @xmath19 of a fibre in the associated family of abelian varieties .    it does not actually matter what dense open @xmath54 we pick in the above definition of monodromy ( as long as the map @xmath58 is regular )",
    "this is because the map @xmath106 is surjective if @xmath107 is dense in the analytic topology so that the images of @xmath93 are the same .",
    "thus sometimes we will take @xmath54 to be the largest open subset where the map @xmath108 is regular .",
    "given an open embedding of normal varieties @xmath109 , the pair @xmath110 has _ the abelian monodromy extension ( ame ) property _ if given any @xmath0 as above the morphism @xmath58 extends to a regular map @xmath52 in a neighbourhood of @xmath20 whenever the local monodromy around @xmath20 is virtually abelian ( a group is virtually abelian if it contains an abelian subgroup of finite index ) . in this case",
    "@xmath51 is complete ( see lemma [ lem1 ] below ) and we say that @xmath51 is an _ ame compactification _ of @xmath57 .",
    "we say @xmath57 has the ame property if it has an ame compactification .",
    "if the pair @xmath110 has the ame property then @xmath51 is complete .",
    "let @xmath111 be a compactification of @xmath51 ( any separated scheme of finite type over @xmath2 has a compactification ) .",
    "consider a blowup @xmath112 so that the boundary @xmath113 is a normal crossing divisor .",
    "then the fundamental group of @xmath114 for a sufficiently small neighbourhood @xmath69 of any point @xmath115 is abelian .",
    "since @xmath116 has the ame property this means that the morphism @xmath117 extends to a morphism @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath119 is complete and @xmath120 is dominant so @xmath51 must also be complete ( since the image of a complete variety is complete ) .    alternatively , one might want to define the ame property by requiring that the morphism extend whenever the local monodromy is abelian instead of virtually abelian .",
    "it turns out these two definitions are the same . to see this suppose the local monodromy is virtually abelian .",
    "the preimage under @xmath98 of a finite index abelian subgroup inside @xmath121 is a finite index subgroup inside @xmath122 and contains a normal finite index subgroup @xmath123 .",
    "take the unramified cover @xmath124 corresponding to @xmath125 and let @xmath126 be the normal closure of @xmath1 in the function field of @xmath127 to get a finite morphism @xmath128 .",
    "then the local monodromy around any point of @xmath129 induced by @xmath130 is abelian and we get a regular extension @xmath131 . by lemma [ lem4 ] below this",
    "means we also get a regular extension @xmath52 .",

    "we need to show @xmath135 is regular assuming @xmath136 is regular .",
    "let @xmath29 be the closure of the image of @xmath1 in @xmath137 .",
    "now if @xmath54 is the domain where @xmath135 is regular then @xmath138 is open and dense in @xmath133 .",
    "then the image of @xmath139 is the closure of the image of @xmath54 which is @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath140 is finite ( since @xmath141 is finite ) and birational ( since @xmath29 is the closure of the image of @xmath1 ) . since @xmath1 is normal this means @xmath120 is an isomorphism and thus @xmath135 is regular .",
    "consider a smooth , deligne - mumford stable @xmath8-pointed curve @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath18 is an ame compactification of @xmath143 . to see this",
    "the key observation is that @xmath142 is stable precisely when @xmath144 is not virtually abelian .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be as above and suppose we have a morphism @xmath145 which does not extend to a regular morphism around some point @xmath43 .",
    "we want to show that this implies the local monodromy around @xmath20 is not virtually abelian .",
    "first resolve the map @xmath146 by some blowup @xmath61 to get a morphism @xmath147 . since the morphism @xmath145 did not extend to a regular map @xmath148 around @xmath20",
    "the restricted map @xmath149 is dominant ( since @xmath18 is one - dimensional ) .",
    "now the local monodromy around @xmath20 with respect to @xmath146 is the same as the local monodromy around @xmath129 with respect to @xmath150 .",
    "this local monodromy is the image of @xmath151 where @xmath69 is some analytic open set whose analytic closure contains @xmath129 .",
    "now we can replace @xmath69 by a bigger open subset @xmath152 which contains @xmath153 such that @xmath154 is dense .",
    "since the map @xmath155 is surjective the images of @xmath156 will be the same .",
    "now if the local monodromy around @xmath129 were virtually abelian then the image of @xmath157 would be virtually abelian .",
    "but this means that the image of @xmath158 would be virtually abelian since it is a subgroup of the image in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "now @xmath159 is a dominant map .",
    "so by lemma [ lem3 ] the induced image of fundamental groups is a finite index subgroup of @xmath144 ( which is not virtually abelian by the key observation above ) .",
    "thus the local monodromy around @xmath129 can not be virtually abelian .",
    "[ lem3 ] let @xmath61 be a dominant morphism between irreducible varieties .",
    "if @xmath1 is normal then the image of the induced map @xmath160 is a finite index subgroup .",
    "see lemma 3.3 ( resp .",
    "lemma 11 ) of @xcite .",
    "alternatively , here is a short proof suggested by the referee . by taking general hyperplane sections of @xmath29",
    "we can find @xmath161 such that the composition @xmath162 generically finite .",
    "then we can restrict @xmath120 to some open @xmath0 such that @xmath163 is finite tale .",
    "so the image @xmath164 has finite index . since @xmath165 is surjective ( this is where we use that @xmath1 is normal )",
    "this means the image of @xmath166 has finite index . since this map factors through @xmath160 the result follows .",
    "the definition of the ame property can be extended to stacks as follows .",
    "we denote stacks using caligraphic font and their coarse moduli spaces by ordinary font .",
    "our stacks will be integral , separated , normal deligne - mumford ( dm ) stacks of finite type over @xmath2 .",
    "notice that by keel - mori @xcite a dm stack always has a coarse moduli scheme .",
    "we will need to use the ( topological ) fundamental group of a stack . for a reference see @xcite .",
    "if the stack is a smooth dm stack then this agrees with the orbifold fundamental group introduced by thurston ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath3 is a stack and @xmath5 a regular morphism then we define the local monodromy around @xmath167 to be @xmath168 where @xmath69 is a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath20 as before .",
    "then a variety @xmath51 containing the coarse space @xmath57 of @xmath3 as an open subset is an ame compactification of @xmath3 if the morphism @xmath5 extends to a morphism @xmath52 in a neighbourhood of @xmath20 whenever the local monodromy around @xmath20 is virtually abelian . as in lemma [ lem1 ] this implies @xmath51 is complete .",
    "note that we only consider a compactification @xmath51 of @xmath57 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "there are basically two reasons to do this .    1 .   under this definition",
    "the pair @xmath169 has the ame property ( theorem [ thm6 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not true that every morphism @xmath170 from a punctured , smooth curve extends to a morphism @xmath171 to the fine moduli stack ( the central fibres might not be a stable curves ) .",
    "since the local fundamental group of any puncture in @xmath172 is @xmath173 ( and in particular abelian ) this means that @xmath174 can not have the ame property in any reasonable sense .",
    "+ similarly , the pair @xmath175 has the ame property ( theorem [ thm5 ] ) even though the baily - borel compactification @xmath47 only compactifies @xmath176 .",
    "so in both these cases it makes sense to consider compactifications of @xmath57 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   suppose @xmath4 is a compactification of @xmath3 with @xmath51 its coarse moduli scheme .",
    "further suppose that we have a morphism @xmath52 extending @xmath177 .",
    "on @xmath1 the fibre product @xmath178 is ( tale locally ) of the form @xmath179 \\rightarrow s$ ] where @xmath180 is a finite cover and @xmath181 is the group of deck transformations .",
    "thus @xmath52 lifts to a morphism @xmath182 on a finite cover @xmath133 of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the extra stack structure on @xmath4 can be ignored if you allow finite base changes and tale localization .",
    "one might then be tempted to consider only schemes .",
    "however , the pair @xmath183 does _ not _ have the ame property because @xmath184 is simply connected ( once you loose the stack structure on @xmath99 the fundamental group becomes trivial ) .",
    "so if we ignored stacks altogether we would lose some nice geometric examples of ame pairs like @xmath169 and @xmath175 .",
    "[ prop4 ] let @xmath3 and @xmath185 be two dm stacks whose coarse spaces @xmath57 and @xmath186 have normal compactifications @xmath51 and @xmath111 . let @xmath187 be a morphism which extends to a finite morphism @xmath188 . if @xmath189 has the ame property then @xmath190 has the ame property .",

    "this is a fibre of the projection @xmath762 so that by lemma [ lem10 ] the whole fibre @xmath759 is collapsed to @xmath747 .",
    "this means that the dimension of the fibre of @xmath763 over @xmath760 \\in a_{g-1}$ ] is at most @xmath748 .",
    "thus @xmath764 , which has dimension @xmath765 , is collapsed by @xmath727 to a variety of dimension at most @xmath766 .",

    "on the other hand , if @xmath768 then @xmath769 where @xmath685 is the determinant of the hodge bundle ( @xcite p.397 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath770 .",
    "since @xmath685 is pulled back from @xmath47 by @xmath727 this implies @xmath738 because otherwise @xmath737 would fail to be projective .",
    "[ lem9 ] let @xmath189 be an ame pair and @xmath771 a toroidal compactification of @xmath57 .",
    "then there exists a regular map @xmath772 extending the identity map on @xmath57 .",
    "locally , @xmath773 is isomorphic to @xmath774 where @xmath775 is normal affine ( and translations by @xmath776 extend to @xmath775 ) .",
    "this means that the local fundamental group around any point @xmath777 is abelian and hence its image in @xmath81 is abelian .",
    "since @xmath51 is an ame compactification the morphism @xmath772 must be regular .",
    "[ lem10 ] consider morphisms @xmath778 between complete , normal varieties",
    "such that the composition @xmath779 is flat with connected fibres and @xmath120 is surjective .",
    "if @xmath120 collapses a single fibre @xmath780 to a point then @xmath9 is an isomorphism .",
    "since @xmath120 collapses @xmath780 to a point the fibre @xmath449 is a point ( here we use that @xmath120 is surjective ) .",
    "thus the relative dimension of @xmath9 is zero .",
    "this means @xmath781 .",
    "if any fibre @xmath782 is positive dimensional then the dimension of @xmath783 is greater than @xmath784 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath779 is flat .",

    "so @xmath9 is surjective with connected fibres of dimension @xmath35 .",
    "this means @xmath9 is quasi - finite and bijective . since @xmath9 is also proper it is in fact finite .",
    "also @xmath9 is bijective so it is birational .",
    "thus @xmath9 is a finite birational map and @xmath57 is normal so @xmath9 is an isomorphism .",
    "what is @xmath785 ?",
    "it seems very likely that @xmath786 . to show this one could try to extend the argument above by studying more carefully the morphism @xmath741 deeper into the boundary of @xmath47 .",
    "there is no reason to consider only principally polarized abelian varieties . more generally , the baily - borel compactification of an arithmetic quotient of any bounded symmetric domain should be its maximal ( projective ) ame compactification .",
    "the fact that the baily - borel compactification is ame follows in much the same way as in the proof of [ thm5 ] except that you need to deal with higher weight hodge structures .",
    "that it is maximal follows from the fact that the baily - borel compactification is the log canonical model ( a result we hope to explain in future work ) .",
    "our definition of the ame property involves the class @xmath787 of abelian groups",
    ". why not consider another class @xmath788 of finitely generated groups ( say solvable groups ) and look for varieties which have the @xmath788 monodromy extension property ?",
    "this is actually a reasonable thing to try to do .",
    "one could , for instance , try to find pairs @xmath116 having the sme ( the solvable monodromy extension ) property .",
    "but this is another story .",
    "the story in this paper is that there are natural moduli spaces which satisfy the ame property . in the case of",
    "@xmath7 we even get an `` if and only if '' statement ( corollary [ cor7 ] ) .    if one tried to find ( say ) @xmath789 there are two possibilities .",
    "either it does not exist or there exists a proper surjective morphism @xmath790 . in the latter case if @xmath691 is an isomorphism then we get nothing new so one might as well stay with the ame property since it is easier to check than the sme property",
    ". if @xmath691 is not an isomorphism then it would indeed be interesting to identify explicitly @xmath789 .",
    "however , as many would agree , @xmath12 is likely the most natural compactification of @xmath10 so it would still be favourable to consider @xmath791 instead of @xmath789 since the former is probably more natural .          in order to show that @xmath116 has the ame property one needs to check that any morphism @xmath58 extends in a neighbourhood of a point @xmath20 whenever the local mondromy around @xmath20 is virtually abelian",
    "this is easier to do if you only need to check pairs of varieties @xmath0 rather than pairs of more arbitrary schemes .",
    "furthermore , as this paper shows it suffices to consider only pairs of varieties @xmath0 in order to get natural maximal ame compactifications such as @xmath464 .",
    "even if we keep the current definition of an ame compactification it may still be interesting to ask what happens if @xmath0 is a pair of more general schemes .",
    "one is tempted to consider either @xmath1 an integral , separated scheme which is not necessarily of finite type or a formal scheme .",
    "the main examples of such schemes would be the localization or the completion of a variety along a subvariety .",
    "the primary example of the latter is the algebraic disk @xmath792)$ ] which is the completion of @xmath793)$ ] along the ideal @xmath794 .",
    "let us sketch a possible answer to these questions . in the finite type case ,",
    "another way of describing the monodromy around @xmath20 is to look at the closure of the image of @xmath795 and to take a small neighbourhood @xmath69 of the proper transform of @xmath20 .",
    "then the local monodromy around @xmath20 is the image of @xmath796 .",
    "the map @xmath797 extends if and only if the proper transform of @xmath20 is a point and the proofs in this paper show that if the proper transform is not a point then the monodromy around it is not virtually abelian .",
    "so , as before , the map extends in a neighbourhood of @xmath20 if the monodromy is virtually abelian .",
    "now , if @xmath1 is an integral , separated scheme but not necessarily of finite type then a variant of this definition should still work assuming that @xmath51 is of finite type .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath1 is the localization of @xmath798 along @xmath799 where @xmath240 are varieties",
    ". then a morphism @xmath58 corresponds to a morphism @xmath800 from some open subset @xmath801 .",
    "so the local monodromy around some @xmath66 is defined as the image of @xmath802 where @xmath69 is a small neighbourhood of the proper transform of @xmath20 .",
    "then the same argument as above shows that @xmath120 extends to a regular map in a neighbourhood of @xmath20 if the monodromy is virtually abelian .",
    "a little more subtle is the case when @xmath1 is a formal scheme which is the completion of @xmath798 along @xmath799 . given a map @xmath797 one should be able to find a subvariety @xmath207 ( at least locally ) such that the image of @xmath54 is the completion of @xmath186 along @xmath803 .",
    "then we would define the local monodromy around a point @xmath66 as the image of @xmath804 where @xmath69 is a local neighbourhood of the proper transform of @xmath20 .",
    "there is a counter example to theorem [ thm : b ] in positive characteristic given in @xcite , page 192 .",
    "since the tame algebraic fundamental group of the complement of a normal crossing divisor is abelian ( @xcite ) , this means that theorem [ specialthm2 ] can not hold in positive characteristic if we change to using the tame algebraic fundamental group and consider formal neighbourhoods instead of analytic ones .",
