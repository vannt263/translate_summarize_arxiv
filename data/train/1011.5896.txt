    "there are two quantities that have historically been used to determine whether a self - gravitating disc is likely to fragment .",
    "the first requires the stability parameter , @xmath2 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* toomre 1964 ) ) , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the sound speed in the disc , @xmath5 is the epicyclic frequency , which for keplerian discs is @xmath6 , the angular frequency , @xmath7 is the surface mass density and @xmath8 is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xcite showed the need for fast cooling and suggested that if the cooling timescale can be parameterised as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the specific internal energy and @xmath11 is the total cooling rate , then fragmentation requires @xmath12 , where the critical cooling timescale , @xmath13 for a ratio of specific heats , @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite performed 3d sph simulations to show the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath15 : for discs with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the above authors show that the cooling condition is equivalent to a maximum gravitational stress that a disc can support without fragmenting .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that @xmath1 depends on the disc and star conditions .",
    "we carry out a thorough convergence test of the value of @xmath0 required for fragmentation using a 3d sph code .",
    "we simulate a @xmath20 disc surrounding a @xmath21 star , spanning a radial range , @xmath22  au , using @xmath16 .",
    "the initial surface mass density and temperature profiles are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and initially , @xmath25 everywhere .",
    "we carry out simulations with this disc setup using 31,250 , 250,000 , 2 million and 16 million particles .",
    "we simulate the discs using various values of @xmath26 to determine @xmath0 at different resolutions .",

    "the graph shows no evidence of convergence with resolution .",
    "the thin dotted line shows how the trend will continue if convergence is not reached with even higher resolution .",

    "if convergence can be achieved , the dotted line would follow a flatter profile.,width=226 ]    figure  [ figure]a shows images of the fragmenting discs at various resolutions .",
    "we see that fragmentation occurs for higher values of @xmath26 as the resolution increases . figure  [ figure]b summarises all the simulations performed . with the data that is available ,",
    "the dividing line between the fragmenting and non fragmenting cases increases linearly with linear resolution and therefore _ convergence has not been reached_.",
    "the lack of convergence certainly shows that the critical value of the cooling timescale is , at the very least , longer than previously thought .",
    "however , it also opens up the possibility that there may be no value of @xmath26 for which such a disc can avoid fragmentation , given sufficient resolution .",
    "if this is the case , it suggests that the problem may be ill posed . in other words",
    ", it may not be possible for a disc to settle into an equilibrium where there is a balance between heating from gravitational instabilities and a _ simple _ imposed cooling timescale .",
    "this implies that a self - gravitating disc that cools at a rate given by @xmath27 , and is only heated by internal dissipation due to gravitational instabilities , may not be able to attain a self - regulated state and will always fragment , regardless of the value of @xmath26 .",
    "this re - opens the question of what the criterion for fragmentation of a self - gravitating disc really is and in addition , where in a disc fragmentation can realistically occur .",
    "these results cast some serious doubts on previous conclusions concerning fragmentation of self - gravitating discs .",
    "in addition , since cooling timescale arguments can be used to determine at what radii in a disc fragmentation can occur ( e.g. rafikov 2009 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clarke 2009 ) ) , the results presented here need to be considered when making conclusions as to whether observed planetary systems may or may not have formed by gravitational instability ."
