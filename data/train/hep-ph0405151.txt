    "radiative decays of low - mass vector mesons into a single photon and a pair of neutral pseudoscalars have attracted continuous attention .",
    "the studies of such decays have been a case for tests of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , through the sequential mechanism @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they also offer the possibility of obtaining information on the nature of low - mass scalar mesons .",
    "in particular the nature and the quark substructure of the two scalar mesons , isoscalar @xmath5 and isovector @xmath6 , have not been established yet .",
    "several proposals have been made about the nature of these states : @xmath7 states in quark model @xcite , @xmath8 molecules @xcite or multiquark @xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "theoretical study of @xmath10 and @xmath11 meson decays into a single photon and pseudoscalar @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons as well as other radiative vector meson decays was initiated by fajfer and oakes @xcite .",
    "they described these decays by the gauged wess - zumino terms in a low - energy effective lagrangian and calculated the branching ratios for these decays in which scalar meson contributions were neglected . in their study , they obtained the following branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the contributions of intermediate vector mesons to the decays @xmath16 were later considered by bramon et al .",
    "@xcite using standart lagrangians obeying su(3 ) symmetry . their results for the decay rates and the branching ratios of the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 were @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "their results were not incompatible with those by fajfer and oakes @xcite even if the initial expressions for the lagrangians were the same .",
    "later , bramon et al .",
    "@xcite studied these decays within the framework of chiral effective lagrangians enlarged to include on - shell vector mesons using chiral perturbation theory , and they calculated the branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays as well as other radiative vector meson decays of the type @xmath21 at the one loop level .",
    "they showed that the one loop contributions are finite and to this order no counterterms are required . in this approach ,",
    "the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 proceed through the intermediate vector meson states and the charged kaon loops and they obtained the contributions of charged kaon - loops to the decay rates of these decays as @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the pion - loop contributions vanishing in the good isospin limit .",
    "their analysis showed that kaon - loop contributions are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the vmd contributions and the dominant pion - loops are forbidden in these decays due to isospin symmetry .",
    "these decays were also investigated by prades @xcite . using chiral lagrangians and the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model he calculated the branching ratios for these decays .",
    "the branching ratios for the radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays were found as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays were also considered by gokalp et al .",
    "@xcite taking into account the contributions of intermediate @xmath2-meson and intermediate vector meson states .",
    "the decay rates and the branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , they obtained , were @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "they concluded that although @xmath2-meson intermediate state amplitude makes a small contribution to @xmath0 decay it makes a substantial contribution to @xmath1 decay .",
    "recently , the radiative decays of the @xmath11 and @xmath10 mesons into two neutral mesons , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , including the mechanisims of sequential vector meson decay , @xmath3 mixing and chiral loops have been studied by palomar et al .",
    "they obtained the branching ratios for the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath32 , @xmath33 and noted that , the dominant contribution is the one corresponding to the sequential mechanism for both cases .",
    "indeed , in their study the @xmath3 mixing was found non negligible for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "theoretically , the effects of the @xmath3 mixing in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays have not been studied extensively up to now .",
    "one of the rare studies of these decays was by palomar et al .",
    "@xcite . in their study",
    "the chiral loops were obtained using elements of @xmath34 which lead to the excitation of the scalar resonances without the need to include them explicitly in the formalism . however",
    ", in our work the effect of @xmath2 ( 980 ) meson in the decay mechanisms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays is included as resulting from @xmath2-pole intermediate state .",
    "we study these decays within the framework of a phenomenological approach in which the contributions of intermediate vector meson states , chiral loops , @xmath3-mixing and of scalar @xmath2 ( 980 ) intermediate meson state are considered .",
    "expressions related with branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays are presented in conclusion .",
    "in our calculation we use the feynman diagrams , corresponding to this mechanism , shown in fig .",
    "1a for @xmath35 decay and in fig .",
    "2a for @xmath36 decay .",
    "the lagrangian for the @xmath37-vertex takes the following form @xmath38 since the coupling constant @xmath39 can not be determined directly from experiments , theoretically it is extracted from some models and obtained the values between @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath41 .",
    "we use the value as @xmath43 @xmath41 for this coupling constant in this work .",
    "the @xmath44-vertices come from the lagrangians @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the vector meson field @xmath47 or @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the pseudoscalar field @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and @xmath50 is the photon field . using the experimental partial widths for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite , we determine the coupling constants as @xmath53=0.696 , @xmath54=1.171 , @xmath55=1.821 , and @xmath56=0.400 . for the @xmath57-vertex we use the following effective lagrangian @xmath58 utilizing the experimental decay widths of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 decays , klingl et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the coupling constant @xmath61 as @xmath62 @xmath41 .",
    "we also use the following momentum dependent width , as discussed by oconnell et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath63 or @xmath10 meson @xmath64 since @xmath65 is small , this effect is negligible for @xmath66 decay .",
    "apart from the vmd contributions , there is another mechanism based on the chiral kaon - loop whose contribution is quite small in the two cases , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in spite of this , we add the kaon - loop contribution for completeness in our calculation .",
    "this mechanism has been studied in @xcite for these decays and here we follow closely results of these studies .",
    "the one loop feynman diagrams for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are of the form shown in fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "2b , respectively . for the contribution of these diagrams",
    "we use the amplitude given in ref . @xcite",
    "derived using chiral perturbation theory .",

    "we will not consider the pion loops for these decays because it does not contribute in good isospin limit .",
    "we add @xmath2-meson as an intermediate state to the decay mechanism of these decays .",
    "the scalar @xmath2-meson contribution were studied before @xcite by gokalp et al . within",
    "the framework of a phenomenological approach for vector meson decays .",
    "we use the feynman diagrams for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays as shown in fig .",

    "since there are no direct experimental results for @xmath80-vertex , we use the values for the coupling constants @xmath78 as @xmath81 @xmath41 and @xmath82 @xmath41 which was determined using the qcd sum rule method in @xcite .",
    "the decay rate for the @xmath83 decay resulting from the above lagrangian is @xmath84 \\left[1-\\frac{(m_{\\pi^{0}}-m_{\\eta})^{2}}{m_{a_{0}}^{2}}\\right]}~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the value @xmath85 gev @xcite , we obtain the coupling constant @xmath79 as @xmath86 gev .",

    "in addition to the vmd contribution given in section 2 , we also consider the mixing of the @xmath11 and @xmath10 mesons which is constituted isospin violation effect due to mass differences of quark and the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "this mixing has been extracted from an analysis of @xmath88 in the @xmath3 interference region .",
    "guetta and singer @xcite firstly considered the @xmath3 mixing in the vector meson decays and then it was used by bramon et al .",
    "@xcite and palomar et al .",
    "new contribution coming from the @xmath3 mixing is to add to the intermediate vector meson diagrams of fig .",
    "1a and fig .",
    "2a for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , expressing the mixing between the isospin states which is described by adding to the effective lagrangian a term @xmath89 leading to the physical states @xmath90 and @xmath91 . then the full amplitude to be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 include the contributions coming from the different terms",
    ", @xmath95 is the mixing parameter @xmath96 and it is obtained as @xmath95=(-0.006+i0.036 ) using the experimental values for @xmath97 and @xmath98 and @xmath99=@xmath100 @xmath101 which determined by oconnell et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another effect of the mixing is modifying the propagator in @xmath102 as follow @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "we express the invariant amplitude @xmath105 using the @xmath3-mixing for the @xmath0 as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath94 are the invariant amplitudes coming from the diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) in fig . 1 and in fig .",
    "2 . for the @xmath1 decay , we follow the same procedure and we can write the full amplitude as @xmath108 .    in our calculation",
    ", the decay width for these decays can be obtained by integration @xmath109 the minimum photon energy is @xmath110=0 and the maximum photon energy is given as @xmath111/2m_{v}$ ] .",

    "we perform an average over the spin states of the vector meson and a sum over the polarization states of the photon .",
    "the contributions of different amplitudes to the decay rate and the branching ratio of the decays , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , are shown in table 1 and table 2 , respectively .",
    "we consider the intermediate vector meson , chiral loops , intermediate @xmath2-meson and @xmath3 mixing .",
    "the dominant contribution is the one corresponding to the vector meson dominance mechanism in two cases except for the @xmath1 decay . on the contrary",
    ", intermediate @xmath2-meson is the dominant contribution of the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the resulting photon spectra for the decay rate is plotted in fig . 3 for the decay @xmath0 and in fig . 4 for the decay @xmath1 .",
    "the separate contributions coming from vector meson dominance amplitude , @xmath120-mixing amplitude , @xmath2-meson intermediate state amplitude , chiral loop amplitudes and their interference , as well as the contribution of total amplitude are explicitly shown .",
    "as we can see in two figures , the contribution of the vmd amplitude does not change if we add the effect of @xmath120-mixing .",
    "the situation changes in two cases when we include vmd , @xmath2-meson intermediate state amplitude with @xmath120-mixing .",
    "the interference term between all contribution is constructive for @xmath0 decay as shown in fig .",
    "3 . for the decay @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2-meson intermediate state amplitude contribution is quite significant in comparison with other contributions as seen clearly in fig .",
    "4 .    the effects of the @xmath3 mixing are too small for both cases , especially for @xmath1 decay it s not any contribution , but it modifies the propagator in the vector meson dominance mechanism , so the @xmath3 mixing should be added the calculation . the loop contribution for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays is found small due to the relatively high mass of the kaons as mentioned also in @xcite .    in table 3",
    ", we collect the results of other analysis and compare our results with other studies and experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite an approach with low energy effective lagrangians with gauged wess - zumino terms was followed .",
    "a different procedure was followed in @xcite using chiral lagrangians and the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model to fix the couplings of the resonance contribution .",
    "the vector meson dominance mechanisms were considered only in @xcite and then the results were improved in @xcite for the @xmath16 decays using the chiral perturbation theory . in @xcite vmd",
    ", chiral loops obtained using elements of unitarized chiral perturbation theory applied in the study of meson - meson interaction , and @xmath3 mixing were considered for @xmath121 decays .",
    "then , in @xcite only vmd and intermediate @xmath2-meson were considered within the framework of a phenomenological approach .    since we do nt have any experimental value the results obtained for the branching ratio of the @xmath1 decay",
    "can not be compared with measurements .",
    "it should be expected that in the near future experiments related with @xmath1 decay will verify or refute our results . for the case of the @xmath0 decay ,",
    "recently the cmd-2 collaboration obtained the following upper limit , @xmath122 @xcite .",
