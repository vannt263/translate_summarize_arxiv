    "a majorana fermion is simply the real or imaginary part of a complex fermion . at first sight",

    "majorana fermions provide a natural description for various topological materials .",
    "the simplest example is the kitaev chain @xcite .",
    "its low - energy degrees of freedom are two majorana excitations at the chain s ends .",
    "two - dimensional topological materials bring richer examples of majorana physics .",
    "for example , majorana edge modes @xcite are expected in several candidates states @xcite for the quantum hall effect at the filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "if a majorana system is in contact with a system of complex fermions then a natural question concerns transformations between the two types of fermions when the systems exchange electrons .",
    "the simplest version of that question involves electron tunneling @xcite . a more interesting setting is a y - junction of majorana modes that merge into a dirac quantum channel .",
    "such junctions can be build on a surface of a 3d topological insulator ( ti )  @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that 1d charge - neutral majorana fermions can exist as subgap edge modes of 2d chiral @xmath2-wave topological superconductors @xcite .",
    "an @xmath3-wave superconductor ( sc ) can also give rise to such modes in a partially gapped hybrid structure with a superconducting film on a surface of a ti . a splitted film that hosts an sc - insulator - sc interface on top of a 3d ti supports a gapped non - chiral 1d majorana mode while an sc / ferromagnet junction supports a gapless chiral one ( @xmath4 mm )  @xcite .",
    "recently topological superconductivity and majorana 1d edge modes were reported in an anomalous quantum hall insulator / sc heterostructure @xcite and in a single atomic pb layer on a magnetic co / si(111 ) island @xcite .",
    "a magnetic domain wall on top of a ti hosts a chiral dirac mode ( @xmath4 dm ) .",

    "the previous work has focused on electric transport in the above devices . in the present paper",

    "our motivation comes from the question about the nonequilibrium state that forms , if two majorana modes with different temperatures fuse into a dirac mode .",

    "in such a structure , the supercurrent is carried by chiral edge states .",
    "a recent experimental realization of a quantum hall junction involved molybdenum - rhenium contacts mediated by a @xmath10 m sized graphene bar encapsulated in boron nitride @xcite . an important feature , common to our setting and the quantum hall device , is the spatial separation of electrons and holes in andreev pairs due to the spatial separation of the chiral transport channels .",

    "the normal region with dirac modes is confined by domain walls where the magnetization sign changes ( the horizontal blue lines in fig .",

    "their wave functions are related via the charge conjugation constraint as @xmath65 .",
    "the dispersion relation is the same as for the majorana channels : @xmath66 .",
    "the difference from the neutral mode consists in the existence of two independent excitations of the same energy @xmath62 in the nambu space : an electron of momentum @xmath67 and a hole of momentum @xmath68 . in terms of bogolyubov operators",

    "the coefficient @xmath86 implies that a neutral majorana fermion carries only a half of the heat current of a dirac mode at the same temperature so that the ballistic heat conductance @xmath90 of a single @xmath4 mm is one half of the heat conductance quantum : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the temperature .",
