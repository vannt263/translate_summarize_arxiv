    "approximately 10% of optically selected quasar samples show blueshifted , broad absorption lines ( bals ) in their spectra ( e.g. weymann et al . 1991 ) .",
    "these features indicate the presence of massive high - velocity ( several percent of light speed ) outflows that may have important effects ( vernaleo & reynolds 2006 , hopkins et al . 2006 , scannapieco & oh 2004 ) ; for example , they may enrich the ism of the quasar host galaxy and surrounding igm and carry away angular momentum from the system .",
    "they may also contribute to a variety of feedback effects such as regulating host galaxy star formation rates ( hopkins & elvis 2010 ) , and limit quasar lifetimes by removing fuel from the nuclear regions ( silk & rees 1998 , king 2003 ) .",
    "however , the true nature of these objects is not yet fully understood and the question still remains :  why do some quasars show bals while others do not ? \"",
    "bal quasars ( balqsos ) of a variety of types have been identified , leading to several sub - classifications .",
    "the majority fall into the category of high ionization balqsos ( hibals ) , in which the bals are formed by highly ionized species such as ( @xmath01549 ) , ( @xmath01397 ) and ( @xmath01240 ) . a smaller fraction , on the order of 1% ( optically selected ) , are lobals that also have broad absorption from elements with lower ionizations , such as ( @xmath02799)(trump et al .",
    "even more rare are lobals which also show absorption from ( @xmath02380 , @xmath02600 , @xmath02750 ) , known as the felobals ( trump et al .",
    "all of these subclasses are represented in our sample .",
    "the true fraction of balqsos however is not yet well known due to several selection effects and their relative rarity . especially for objects with large bal equivalent widths",
    ", the amount of absorption may be significant enough to under represent balqsos in magnitude - limited samples .",
    "this is heavily dependent on redshift and the wavelength coverage of the observations as much of the absorption occurs at rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "it is possible that this is even more important for extreme lobals because of the large number of absorption troughs present shortward of 2800  ( hewett & foltz 2003 ) .",
    "hewett & foltz ( 2003 ) use an empirical k - correction to account for differences in spectral energy distributions between balqsos and non - balqsos , resulting in a higher intrinsic balqso fraction of around 22% . in a recent catalog of balqsos from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 ( sdss dr5 ) , gibson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find a bal fraction of about 15% , which increases to about 19% when the fact that balqsos tend to be more reddened than non - balqsos is accounted for .",
    "additionally , in a sample of gravitationally lensed quasars , chartas ( 2000 ) finds 7 of 20 ( 35% ) show bals .",
    "it has become increasingly apparent that the true fraction of balqsos is higher than simple observed fractions .",
    "balqsos are generally a highly polarized subclass of quasars , with 9 of 28 showing optical broadband polarization of 2% or greater compared to 2 of 115 non - balqsos ( hines & schmidt 1997 ) .",
    "there have been a few spectropolarimetry surveys done in the last several years , for example ogle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and schmidt , hines , and smith ( 1997 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry of small samples and individual objects has been published as well covering a wide range of balqso types ( goodrich & miller 1995 , cohen et al .",
    "1995 , glenn et al .",
    "1994 ) . in general ,",
    "these results show common trends among polarized balqso properties : continuum polarization can exceed 10% and the polarization generally decreases at longer wavelengths .",
    "trends are also seen in the polarization levels of spectral lines ; levels in absorption lines tend to be equal to or greater than that of the continuum , and emission lines are generally similarly or less polarized than the continuum .",
    "one proposed explanation for the difference between balqsos and normal quasars is a simple orientation scheme . in this",
    "paradigm outflows are common to all quasars , but only approximately 10% are seen along a line of sight that intersects the outflow and therefore show bals .",
    "drawing on the unification of seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 ) , balqsos in this paradigm are those quasars seen at high inclinations with the line of sight cutting through an equatorial outflow .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) observed that the emission - line properties of balqsos are very similar to those of non - balqsos and this is taken to support this view , despite the fact that some differences in the spectra are noted as well ( see also turnshek et al .",
    "the distinctions between balqso subclasses have also been explained via orientation ; in this scheme lobals are those balqsos seen at the largest inclinations , where the line of sight begins to cut through the outflow at a larger distance from the central engine so that lower ionization levels are seen .",
    "spectropolarimetry results have also been used to support the orientation scheme ( goodrich & miller 1995 , hines & wills 1995 , cohen et al .",
    "1995 for starters ) .",
    "the interpretation of spectropolarimetry results also drew heavily on analogies with the unification of seyfert galaxies by orientation .",
    "however , there has been growing evidence that the orientation paradigm is incorrect , at least in its simplest forms .",
    "once thought to be strictly radio - quiet ( stocke et al . 1984 ) , relatively recent large and deep radio surveys like first ( becker et al . 1995 ) and nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) helped show that radio - loud balqsos do exist ( brotherton et al .",
    "1998 , for example ) .",
    "becker et al . ( 2000 ) pointed out that balqsos exhibit both flat and steep radio spectra , which suggests a much wider range of orientations than just edge on .",
    "pole - on sources generally show optically thick , beamed synchrotron emission with a flat radio spectrum , while edge - on sources most strongly show optically thin radio lobe emission with a steep radio spectrum .",
    "zhou et al . ( 2006 ) and ghosh & punsly ( 2007 ) have also found evidence for short timescale variation of balqso radio sources , which is best explained by relativistic beaming and a pole - on orientation , indicating the presence of polar rather than equatorial outflows .",
    "an alternative to the orientation paradigm is a unification by time in which balqsos are a short phase in the lifetime of all quasars , and radio observations strengthen this case .",
    "it has been noted that only a small fraction , about 10% , of balqsos are extended at first resolutions ( 5 arcsec ) ( becker et .",
    "al . 2000 ) while about 50% of non - balqsos selected in a similar way are extended sources .",
    "montenegro - montes et al . ( 2008 ) find in their study of a sample of 15 balqsos that all 15 show compact morphology at first resolutions .",
    "even observations at higher frequencies , thus higher resolutions , show that the majority are very compact , with linear size scales of less than 1 kpc .",
    "high resolution vlbi observations of balqsos find similar properties",
    "( jiang & wang 2003 , doi et al .",
    "this size scale along with the convex shape of the radio spectra is typical of compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , which odea ( 1998 ) has suggested are in fact young radio sources . in addition , montenegro - montes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that the radio spectral index distribution for their sample is not significantly different from a compact non - balqso sample , indicating that the balqsos do not have a preferred orientation .",
    "gregg et al . ( 2002 , 2006 ) suggest that a bal phase evolves into a radio - loud normal quasar phase with a short overlap .",
    "x - ray observations show that radio - loud balqsos tend to be x - ray brighter than radio - quiet balqsos , but faint compared to non - balqsos ( brotherton et al .",
    "2005 , miller et al .",
    "this provides more evidence that radio - loud balqsos are an intermediate lifetime phase .",
    "polarization of radio - loud balqsos has been somewhat addressed in the past ( wills et al .",
    "1999 , hutsemekers & lamy 2000 ) , but a deep look at a large sample is still needed . using a large sample of balqsos with radio information and spectropolarimetry",
    ", we can test the orientation schemes . in order for a measurable polarization signal to be observed , the scattering region can not be symmetric and",
    "therefore there is geometric information present . using radio spectral indices and a large sample to ensure statistical significance",
    ", we can search for correlations between viewing angle and polarization properties , mainly polarization percentages and polarization position angles .",
    "combining this with polarization information from various spectral features ( continuum , bals , emission lines ) we can potentially reveal the geometry of the central regions of balqsos . to this end",
    "we have begun work on a project involving a large sample of balqsos for which we have or will be obtaining radio information and spectropolarimetry .",

    "three balqsos in our sample have been identified as extended radio sources and their properties are summarized in table  [ extendedtbl ] .",
    "the criteria for classifying these objects as extended was by comparing the first integrated ( @xmath25 ) and peak ( @xmath26 ) 1.4 ghz fluxes ; objects with @xmath27mjy are considered extended .",

    "the results in the previous section indicate that there is little difference in the polarization properties between radio - selected and radio - quiet balqsos .",
    "the rising polarization in bal troughs and decreasing polarization in emission lines are general trends already seen in radio - quiet balqsos , and we see similar trends in our radio - selected sample . another similarity is shown in figure  [ quietloudfig ] , a histogram of the white - light polarization for our sample versus the radio - quiet sample ( 53 objects ) of schmidt & hines ( 1999 ) .",

    "it should be noted however that the difference between the schmidt & hines ( 1999 ) sample and that of hines & schmidt ( 1997 ) could be in the choice of cutoff for included objects ; the earlier sample only included objects for which @xmath48 , while the later one used a stricter criterion of @xmath49 .",

    "these results are in agreement with the findings of hutsemekers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in that the highest polarizations are seen in the lobal / felobal subclasses and the range in polarization for those classes is higher than for hibals . implications of these results will be analyzed when we have added more data to the sample .",
    "the preliminary correlation analysis does not lend any support to the orientation dependent schemes for explaining balqsos .",
    "the most important comparison here is between polarization and the radio spectral index . since @xmath41 is a rough indicator of orientation ( see  1 ) , the fact that there is no correlation with the polarization may be an indication that balqsos do not differ from other qsos simply by viewing angle . in the edge - on picture",

    "the radio spectrum should also become steeper as viewing angle increases , and we would thus expect to see a correlation between higher polarization and steeper radio spectrum .",
