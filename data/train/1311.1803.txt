    "in game theory , a fundamental notion is _ nash equilibrium _ ( ne ) , which is a state that is _ stable _ against deviations of any individual participants ( known as agents ) of the game in the sense that any such deviation will not bring about additional benefit to the deviator .",
    "much stronger stability is exhibited by a _",
    "strong nash equilibrium _ ( sne ) , a notion introduced by aumann @xcite , at which no coalition of agents exists such that each member of the coalition can benefit from coordinated deviations by the members of the coalition .",
    "evidentally selfish individual agents stand to benefit from cooperation and hence snes are much more preferred to nes for stability .",
    "however , snes do not necessarily exist @xcite and , even if they do , they are much more difficult to identify and to compute @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very much desirable to have the advantages of both computational efficiency and strong stability , which motivates our study in this paper .",
    "we establish that , for general ne job assignments in load balancing games , which exist and are easy to compute , their loss of strong stability possessed by snes is at most 25% .    in a load balancing game , there are @xmath7 selfish agents , each representing one of a set @xmath8 of @xmath7 jobs . in the absence of a coordinating authority ,",
    "each agent must choose one of @xmath0 identical servers , @xmath9 , to assign his job to in order to complete the job as soon as possible .",
    "all jobs assigned to the same server will finish at the same time , which is determined by the workload of the server , defined to be the total processing time of the jobs assigned to the server .",
    "let job @xmath10 have a processing time @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and let @xmath13 denote the set of jobs assigned to server @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . for convenience , we will use  agent \" and `` job '' interchangeably , and consider job processing times also as their `` lengths '' .",
    "the completion time @xmath16 of job @xmath17 is the _ workload _ of its server : @xmath18 .",
    "the notions of ne and sne can be stated more specifically for the load balancing game . a job assignment @xmath19 is said to be an ne if no individual job @xmath20 can reduce its completion time @xmath21 by unilaterally migrating from server @xmath14 to another server . a job assignment @xmath19 is said to be an sne if no subset @xmath22 of jobs can each reduce their job completion times by forming a coalition and making coordinated migrations from their own current servers",
    ".    nes in the load balancing game have been widely studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with the main focus of quantifying their loss of global optimality in terms of the price of anarchy , a term coined by koutsoupias and papadimitriou @xcite , as largely summarized in @xcite . in this paper , we study nes in load balancing games from a different perspective by quantifying their loss of strong stability .",
    "we focus on pure nes , those corresponding to deterministic job assignments in load balancing games .",
    "while high - quality nes are easily computed , identification of an sne is strongly np - hard @xcite .",
    "given any job assignment in a load balancing game , the _ improvement ratio _ ( ir ) of a deviation of a job is defined as the ratio between the pre- and post - deviation costs .",
    "an ne is said to be a @xmath2-approximate sne ( @xmath3 ) ( which is called @xmath2-se in @xcite ) if there is no coalition of jobs such that each job of the coalition will have an ir more than @xmath2 from coordinated deviations of the coalition .",
    "clearly , the stability of ne improves with a decreasing value of @xmath2 and a @xmath23-approximate sne is in fact an sne itself .    for the load balancing game of two servers",
    ", one can easily verify that every ne is also an sne @xcite .",
    "if there are three or four servers in the game , then it is proved in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , that any ne assignment is a @xmath24-approximate sne , and the bound is tight .",
    "furthermore , it is a @xmath25-approximate sne if the game has @xmath0 servers for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we establish in this paper that , in the @xmath0-server load balancing game ( @xmath5 ) , any ne is a @xmath24-approximate sne , which is tight and hence closes the final gap in the literature on the study of ne approximation of sne in load balancing games . to establish our approximation bound",
    ", we make a novel use of a powerful graph - theoretic tool .",
    "we start with an example to help the reader get some intuition of the problem under consideration .",
    "the example also provides a lower bound of @xmath27 for any ne assignment to approximate sne .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lower_bound ] below shows an ne assignment of six jobs to three identical machines with job completions @xmath28 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , for the three pairs of jobs .",
    "if the four jobs of lengths @xmath4 and @xmath28 form a coalition and make a coordinated deviation as shown in the figure , then in the resulting assignment , each of the four jobs in the coalition achieves an improvement ratio of @xmath27 .     +      as a tool of our analysis , we start with the minimal deviation graph introduced by chen @xcite . for convenience",
