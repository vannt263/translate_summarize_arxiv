    "since the nmc publication @xcite on the gottfried sum rule violation the effect of @xmath0 asymmetry was in the 90 s one of the most intensively discussed problems of nucleon structure .",
    "the effect is clearly of nonperturbative nature and was qualitatively explained as due to the pion ( meson ) cloud in the nucleon ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . in order to shed more light on the nature of the gottfried sum rule violation two",
    "different drell - yan experiments were proposed and performed @xcite .",
    "they measured the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the integrated result for the asymmetry from the more complete fermilab experiment @xcite is @xmath6 \\ ; dx$ ] = 0.09 @xmath7 0.02 , to be compared with the nmc result : @xmath6 \\ ; dx$ ] = 0.148 @xmath7 0.039 .",
    "the nmc asymmetry apears slightly bigger .",
    "it was suggested recently by two of us that the difference can be partly due to large higher - twist effects for the nonsinglet quantity @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in ref.@xcite how to use semi - inclusive production of pions to extract the asymmetry of light antiquarks in the nucleon .",
    "this method was applied recently by the hermes collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "recent results for semi - inclusive production of pions in polarized photoproduction obtained at slac @xcite have shown that spin asymmetry almost cancels for small transverse momenta of the outgoing pions , which seems to be another nonperturbative effect .",
    "this result was interpreted as a large vdm contribution @xcite for small transverse momenta . only at large transverse momenta",
    "may the perturbative qcd processes reveal themselves and only then can one try to disentangle the polarized quark distributions in the nucleon . at low photon virtuality , as in the hermes experiment where @xmath9 2.3 gev@xmath10 , similar nonperturbative effects can be expected in the unpolarized case .    in the present paper",
    "we try to examine the semi - inclusive production of pions in dis as a source for measuring the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "we investigate several effects , mostly of nonperturbative nature , which may modify the resulting asymmetry .",
    "in particular , making quantitative estimations , we focus on conclusions relevant for the hermes experiment .",
    "the most general five - fold cross section for one - particle semi - inclusive unpolarized lepton - hadron scattering can be expressed in terms of four independent semi - inclusive structure functions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "if the azimuthal correlation between the lepton scattering plane and the hadron production plane is not studied , the number of independent structure functions reduces to two .",
    "then the cross section can be written as @xmath11   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are standard dis variables , @xmath15 is the transverse momentum of the detected hadron with respect to the momentum of the virtual photon and @xmath16 is a relativistically invariant variable which in the target rest frame is the fraction of the virtual photon energy @xmath17 carried by the hadron . in the formula above , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are the four - momenta of the target nucleon , final hadron and virtual photon , respectively .",
    "if one is not interested in the transverse momentum distribution of the emitted hadron then the triple - differential cross section can be written in a more compact way @xmath21 \\ ; .\\ ] ] in the quark - parton model ( qpm ) only mechanisms shown in fig.[fig_part_dgs ] are assumed .",
    "usually in calculations one does not distinguish diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that diagram ( b ) can be included effectively on the same footing as diagram ( a ) .",
    "we shall discuss later possible restrictions of such an approach .    in the naive qpm the generalized semi - inclusive structure functions @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "are related by the callan - gross relation leaving only one independent structure function , which can be written as @xmath24 where the sum runs over the quark / antiquark flavours @xmath25 ; @xmath26 are quark distribution functions and @xmath27 are so - called fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "quite a number of fragmentation functions can be reduced by the requirement of isospin symmetry and charge conjugation : @xmath28 for the favoured fragmentation and @xmath29 for the unfavoured fragmentation . for the strange / antistrange fragmentation , in principle",
    ", a third type of fragmentation functions has to be assumed . in the following",
    "we shall assume simply : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a reduction factor with respect to nonstrange quarks / antiquarks .",
    "in calculations we shall use @xmath31 = 1.0 .",
    "now , in the quark - parton model ( [ semi_parton ] ) using symmetry relations ( [ favoured_ff]-[unfavoured_ff ] ) one can combine semi - inclusive cross sections for the production of positive and negative pions on proton and neutron targets and isolate a quantity sensitive to the flavour asymmetry @xcite @xmath32 - [ 1 + r(x , z ) ] }       { j(z ) [ 1 - r(x , z ) ] + [ 1 + r(x , z ) ] } \\ ; , \\label{exp_extract}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a ratio of differences of charged pion yields on proton and neutron .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the fragmentation of strange quarks / antiquarks cancels in the quantity @xmath35 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the r.h.s .   in eq.([exp_extract ] ) , formally dependent on @xmath4 , gives a quantity independent of @xmath4 .",
    "thus semi - inclusive production of charged pions in dis allows us to determine the asymmetry of light sea quarks .",
    "although this is on condition that the qpm works well , that is , one may neglect the influence of other possible mechanisms .",
    "it is a well known fact that pions produced directly in the fragmentation process constitute only a fraction of all pions registered in detectors .",
    "the contribution of pions coming from the decay of heavier mesons is of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "because the intermediate resonances originate from the fragmentation of the struck quark their contribution can be included into an overall `` effective '' fragmentation function .",
    "modern analyses of fragmentation functions do not treat intermediate resonances explicitly , just include them effectively by fitting total inclusive data .",
    "however , it is not clear , a priori , whether under a more detailed consideration such an effective treatment is correct and whether resonances do not disturb the identity ( [ exp_extract ] ) .    to treat the intermediate resonances",
    "explicitly we write down the fragmentation function as a sum of two parts : a direct fragmentation component ( fig.[fig_part_dgs]a ) and a resonance component ( fig.[fig_part_dgs]b ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a fragmentation function of the direct fragmentation of a quark @xmath38 into a pion @xmath39 , @xmath40 describes the production of a pion @xmath39 through an intermediate resonance @xmath41 and the sum runs over all possible resonances .",
    "it is known experimentally that for pion production the vector meson intermediate states are the most important . for not too small @xmath4 , neglecting for simplicity transverse momenta",
    ", the contribution of the resonance @xmath41 to the fragmentation function can be approximated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the minimal possible @xmath4 of the resonance @xmath41 , @xmath45 is a fragmentation function for the direct fragmentation of a quark @xmath38 into a resonance @xmath41 , and @xmath46 describes the decay of the resonance @xmath41 to pionic channels .",
    "the fragmentation process transforms quarks with the third component of isospin @xmath47 into measured pions with @xmath48 i.e.   there are two initial and two final states of fragmentation with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "if the quark hadronization is driven by the strong interaction ( isospin symmetric ) then , in the case of direct fragmentation , one naturally obtains only two kinds of fragmentation functions related by ( [ favoured_ff]-[unfavoured_ff ] ) . for the resonance contribution",
    "@xmath50 , if the sum comprises possible intermediate states and if in addition the isospin is conserved in the decay of resonances , one still has only two kinds of fragmentation functions :    @xmath51    and @xmath52 these functions correspond uniquely to the standard favoured and unfavoured fragmentation functions and fulfil the relation ( [ favoured_ff]-[unfavoured_ff ] ) needed to obtain the identity ( [ exp_extract ] ) .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that intermediate resonances do not violate eq.([exp_extract ] ) i.e.  do not disturb the procedure of extraction of the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "however , one can not avoid completely the explicit treatment of intermediate resonances when modelling pion spectra . the fragmentation functions ( [ ff_decompos ] ) with the resonance components ( [ res_frag_dec ] ) do not ( ! ) obey the qcd evolution equation ; this is usually ignored in the current literature .",
    "it would be useful to separate out the direct fragmentation contribution to the fragmentation functions , which has a better chance of obeying the qcd evolution equations .",
    "however , to determine the fragmentation functions of the direct fragmentation one would need to perform a combined analysis of fragmentation into pions and into all other resonances having pionic decay channels . such an involved experimental analysis has never yet been done .      in order to estimate the effect of nonpartonic components on the extraction of @xmath0 asymmetry we need to fix fragmentation functions with which the main partonic term will be calculated .",
    "modern parametrizations of fragmentation functions are fitted mostly to data from @xmath53 collisions .",
    "these analyses include leading or next - to - leading order qcd corrections ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath53 collisions the situation in @xmath54 scattering is much less developed : less experimental data , no qcd analysis .",
    "let us see how the existing parametrizations of fragmentation functions behave in @xmath54 collisions .",
    "we start the quantitative estimations by comparing the existing fragmentation functions with the @xmath4-distributions of charged pions in @xmath54 scattering .    in fig.[fig_cha_pi ] we present @xmath55 data obtained long ago at cornell @xcite ( panel a ) with kinematics similar to the hermes experiment , and the data from emc @xcite ( panel b ) with slightly higher @xmath14 .",
    "we show also the qpm predictions obtained with fragmentation functions from the fit to @xmath53 data @xcite , from the fit to @xmath53 and photoproduction data @xcite which include qcd corrections , and with fragmentation functions from the simple qpm fits to the @xmath54 data @xcite .",
    "surprisingly the `` advanced '' parametrizations give a much worse description of the data than simple ones do .",
    "however , simple parametrizations are limited to the relevant values of @xmath14 .    in principle the modern fragmentation functions used in @xmath53 @xcite",
    "were obtained including qcd corrections , i.e.   beyond the naive quark - parton model .",
    "the correct formulae for the cross section in dis calculated including qcd corrections are more complicated than qpm ones @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the analysis of the hermes experiment @xcite was performed based on simple qpm formulae , using eq.([exp_extract ] ) . therefore in order to compare with those results we have to stay at the qpm level too and ignore some inconsistency .",
    "moreover the qcd evolution of fragmentation functions ( included in the calculation ) changes the pion multiplicity in agreement with the trend of experimental data and might create the main part of the @xmath14-dependence even when used with qpm formulae .",
    "the whole effect of the inconsistency should , however , be clarified in the future .    in electron - positron scattering",
    "the number of negative and positive pions produced is identical .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath54 scattering . here",
    "quark distributions in the proton , isospin - asymmetric by their nature , allow us to distinguish between the favoured and unfavoured fragmentation which is very difficult , if not impossible , in @xmath56 scattering . as can be seen from eq.([exp_extract ] ) such a separation is essential for our analysis .    in fig.[fig_nepo_pi ]",
    "we show @xmath4-distributions of negative ( upper panel ) and positive ( lower panel ) pions as measured by the emc collaboration @xcite .",
    "different sets of fragmentation functions are confronted with the experimental data .",
    "a surprisingly poor description of the data is obtained with fragmentation functions from @xmath53 scattering @xcite .",
    "not very good agreement of the field - feynman parametrization is most probably due to a different @xmath14 here ( @xmath57 20 gev@xmath10 ) than that where it was designed @xcite .",
    "a correct qcd evolution should resolve this disagreement .",
    "as will be discussed below both qpm - parametrizations give reasonable representations of the ratio of unfavoured to favoured fragmentation functions , which is a more slowly qcd - evolving quantity .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 directly enters formula ( [ exp_extract ] ) and , as our analysis shows , the measured @xmath0 asymmetry is very sensitive to it . in fig.[fig_unf_fa_r ] we display the ratio obtained from the analysis of experimental data from emc @xcite and recently obtained by the hermes collaboration at desy @xcite .",
    "the simple qpm parametrizations @xcite provide a reasonable description of the data .",
    "in contrast the``advanced '' fragmentation functions @xcite fail again .",
    "is it due to a different physics in @xmath56 collisions than in dis , or is it due to qcd corrections , or is it due to something else ? in our opinion",
    "this    is mainly due to the fact that the @xmath56 data are not sufficient to separate unambiguously the favoured and unfavoured fragmentation functions .",
    "a qcd analysis of dis fragmentation functions is called for .",
    "the analysis above advocates the field - feynman parametrization @xcite as the only good representation of the available @xmath54 data in the hermes kinematical region .",
    "this parametrization will be used in the following analysis .",
    "for small @xmath14 , as for the hermes experiment , some mechanisms of nonpartonic origin ( see e.g.   fig.[fig_nonp_dgs ] ) may become important .",
    "for instance , the virtual photon can interact with the nucleon via its intermediate hadronic state .",
    "such a mechanism is usually described within the vector dominance model ( vdm ) .",
    "the photon could also fluctuate into a pair of pions , where both or one of them interact with the nucleon .",
    "in addition some exclusive processes can produce pions directly or as decay products of heavier mesons .    to our best knowledge none of such processes",
    "has been investigated in the literature .",
    "their influence on the extracted @xmath0 asymmetry also remains unknown .",
    "we shall discuss processes shown in fig.[fig_nonp_dgs ] one by one .",
    "let us start from the vdm component ( see fig.[fig_nonp_dgs]a ) .",
    "it was shown that in the inclusive dis incorporation of the vdm contribution and related modification of the partonic component help to understand the behaviour of structure functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 at small @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this model was confirmed by a recent analysis of the @xmath14 dependence of the world data for the structure function difference @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the model for inclusive structure functions @xcite can be generalized to semi - inclusive production of pions : @xmath61 the second sum above runs over vector mesons @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a correction factor which takes into account finite fluctuation times of the virtual photon into vector mesons for large @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the inclusive cross section for pion production in vector meson ( @xmath64 ) scattering off the proton and neutron is not known experimentally .",
    "there is no model in the literature that one can trust quantitatively but in analogy to the total @xmath65 cross section the cross section @xmath66 can be estimated as : @xmath67 \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma(\\rho^0",
    "n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x ) & \\approx &    1/2 \\ ; [ \\sigma(\\pi^+ n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x )           + \\sigma(\\pi^- n \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm } x ) ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    experimental data from the abbcchw collaboration @xcite at @xmath68 = 8 , 16 gev correspond approximately to the range of the hermes experiment @xcite . unfortunately as it often happens in high - energy physics",
    "there is only data for proton targets . using isospin symmetry for hadronic reactions one can obtain corresponding cross sections on the neutron from those on the proton by assuming @xmath69 these relations",
    "hold not only for the total cross sections but also for differential ones independently of energy . from the most complete data at @xmath68 = 16 gev @xcite ( w = 5.56 gev",
    ") we get + @xmath70 $ ] = 38.65 @xmath7 0.29",
    "mb , + @xmath71 ] = 31.80 @xmath7 0.22 mb ; + clearly different values .",
    "although the bulk of the difference comes from the target fragmentation region , which we are not interested in , in the beam fragmentation region it was also found @xmath72 = 14.8 mb and @xmath73 = 19.0 mb @xcite with almost equal cross sections for beam - like pions .",
    "the situation in the semi - inclusive case is more complicated than for total cross sections .",
    "the experimental spectra for @xmath74 contain components due to peripheral processes , which are , in general , specific , different for different reactions .",
    "peripheral processes from the @xmath75 and @xmath76 reactions do not contribute to the @xmath77 reaction and should be eliminated ; only nondiffractive components of the @xmath78 reactions should be taken into account when modelling @xmath79-induced reactions .",
    "beam will be included explicitly in section [ sec_excl_rho ] . ]",
    "this requires physically motivated parametrization of the @xmath80 data .    following these arguments",
    "we have parametrized the experimental differential cross sections for four different reactions @xmath74 from @xcite as a sum of central and peripheral components @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the well known feynman variable .",
    "details of this analysis will be presented elsewhere , a short sketch is given in appendix [ app_bosetti ] . because the cm - energy of the abbcchw collaboration is very similar to that of the hermes experiment , we believe that in the range of energy relevant for this experiment the functional form given in the appendix is suitable .",
    "finally , our analysis of experimental data @xcite combined with the assumption of isospin symmetry ( [ vdm_isosp_sym ] ) shows that for the nondiffractive components still @xmath83    in fig.[fig_apn_vdm ] we show @xmath84 for both positive and negative pions .",
    "an identical value of the asymmetry is expected for the @xmath85 beam and a similar one for the @xmath86 beam .",
    "this automatically means practically the same result for photon ( real or virtual ) induced reactions which proceed via hadronic intermediate states .",
    "we obtain rather large asymmetries , larger than for total photoproduction cross sections on the proton and neutron .",
    "different cross sections on proton and neutron mean that the vdm contribution modifies the r.h.s .  of eq.([exp_extract ] ) .    in fig.[fig_hermes_v ]",
    "we show a modification of the measured quantity @xmath87 due to the central vdm component . in the hermes experiment @xcite",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath88 vary with bjorken-@xmath12 , but the change of energy is considerably smaller . in the present calculation",
    "the photon - proton cm energy was fixed at the average hermes value @xmath88 = 5.0 gev@xmath10 . in the panel ( a )",
    "we show a result of a calculation where the central vdm component discussed in this section is simply added to the main fragmentation component . in the panel ( b )",
    "the fragmentation component in addition was rescaled by the factor @xmath89 ( see eq.([su_semi ] ) ) which is required for consistency of inclusive and semi - inclusive structure functions .",
    "the solid line in both panels represents @xmath87 obtained directly from the parton distributions @xcite . as can be seen from the figure the r.h.s .  of eq.([exp_extract ] ) clearly deviates from the assumed partonic outcome .",
    "the effect is surprisingly large , especially for small @xmath12 .",
    "is only of the order of 1 - 2 gev@xmath10 . ]",
    "thus , the quark flavour asymmetry extracted from semi - inclusive experiments in the simple qpm approach seems to be highly overestimated if the vdm contribution is neglected .",
    "the vdm effect discussed in this section is not completely new . a similar effect of the hadronic structure of the photon on the difference of semi - inclusive cross sections @xmath90",
    "was already noticed long ago in real photoproduction @xcite .",
    "although in dis the effect is smaller , it , however , strongly modifies the measured @xmath0 asymmetry .      in both partonic and central vdm mechanisms",
    "the virtual photon is totally absorbed and pions are produced in a complex process involving many degrees of freedom .",
    "such pions are then preferentially emitted at not very large values of @xmath4 .",
    "the peripheral processes are not included either in the partonic or the central vdm component considered above and are expected to be important in the region of large @xmath4 where these processes disappear .",
    "let us consider first the spectator mechanism depicted in fig.[fig_nonp_dgs]b . to our knowledge",
    "such a mechanism has been never discussed in the literature for photon induced reactions .",
    "we begin with the case of real photoproduction where we can apply a technique from @xcite . for virtual photons with @xmath91",
    "the formalism is not well developed .",
    "the cross section for the spectator pions @xmath92 in real photoproduction can be expressed as a product of the distribution of pions in the photon ( @xmath93 ) and the off - shell total cross section for scattering of @xmath92 off the proton or neutron : @xmath94 at small @xmath95 energies @xmath96 relevant for the spectator mechanism there can be a difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . together with isospin symmetry of hadronic reactions this would lead to different @xmath99 and @xmath100 i.e.  would modify the identity ( [ exp_extract ] ) . to represent the total cross sections of @xmath92 scattering off nucleons we use cubic interpolation of the world experimental data @xcite .",

    "see @xcite .    in fig.[fig_photo_pi ]",
    "we show the result of our calculation ( dashed line ) with cut - off mass 1.5 gev as in ref.@xcite for @xmath106 = 4.28 gev corresponding to the experimental data from slac @xcite with @xmath107 = 9.3 gev .",
    "the results are presented in terms of the invariant single particle structure function @xcite ( see also eq.([inv_spstrf ] ) in appendix [ app_bosetti ] ) .",
    "the energy in the pion - proton subsystem decreases with increasing @xmath82 and we observe fluctuations due to @xmath108-channel @xmath95 resonances .",
    "the peaks would be even more pronounced at smaller photon energies and would disappear completely at larger photon energies .",
    "the contribution of the spectator mechanism calculated with reasonable cut - off masses in the vertex form factor is smaller than experimental data . a dominant fraction of pions produced at large @xmath82 appears to be given by the mechanism of elastic @xmath79-meson production and its subsequent decay ( discussed in detail in section [ sec_excl_rho ] ) . by the short - dashed line we present this contribution corresponding to the cross section calculated as : @xmath109 where the explicit functional form of the decay function @xmath110 can be found in appendix [ app_rho0_dec ]",
    ". in the calculation",
    "we have used the experimental value @xmath111 = 13 @xmath112b , relevant for @xmath107 = 9.3 gev .",
    "the sum of both contributions ( solid line ) seems to be consistent with the large-@xmath82 part of the pion spectrum .",
    "thus in real photoproduction the spectator mechanism becomes non - negligible only at large @xmath82 ( or @xmath4 ) .    in virtual photoproduction",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the absolute normalization of @xmath113 should depend on the virtuality of the photon .",
    "however , it can not be calculated from first principles as it involves a vertex form factor where more than one particle is off mass shell .",
    "empirically such cases are strongly damped @xcite .",
    "also a naive use of a typical light - cone parametrization of the vertex form factors @xcite with the mass of the parent particle replaced by the virtuality of the photon leads to a strong suppression in comparison to real photoproduction .",
    "how strong this suppression is in comparison to the suppression of the elastic-@xmath79 production mechanism is not clear . for photon virtualities of the order of @xmath114 2 - 4 gev@xmath10",
    "we find that the elastic-@xmath79 contribution , discussed in detail in the next section , together with the partonic component , totally accounts for the cross sections at large @xmath4 , leaving practically no room for the spectator mechanism ( see fig.[fig_mult_all ] ) .    in summary , the spectator mechanism , while potentially important in real photoproduction is most probably negligible in dis .",
    "the exclusive meson production @xmath115 is one more mechanism not included in the fragmentation formalism ( eq.([semi_parton ] ) ) and may also modify the extraction of the @xmath0 asymmetry .",

    "contribute at @xmath117 1 , i.e.  outside of the range of the hermes kinematics and will be ignored in the following discussion .",
    "in contrast , the pions from the decays of light vector mesons may be important in the context of the @xmath0 asymmetry from semi - inclusive pion production .",
    "the production of @xmath3 mesons ( @xmath118 ) seems to be of particular importance .",
    "firstly , the @xmath65 channel is known to be the dominant exclusive channel in @xmath119 scattering . secondly , because @xmath79 decays predominantly into two pions this will produce pions with @xmath120 . a detailed calculation",
    "( see appendix [ app_rho0_dec ] ) shows that the dispersion of the decay pion @xmath4-distribution is large and therefore this effect has a chance of being observed at large @xmath4 where the hadronization rate is already much smaller .",
    "the next potentially important mechanism is the @xmath85 meson ( @xmath121 ) production .",
    "however , the dominant @xmath85 meson decay channel is the three - body system @xmath122 i.e. it is expected to contribute to the inclusive pion distribution at @xmath123 , i.e.   in the region where the hadronization rate is large .",
    "moreover the cross section for the @xmath85 channel is smaller than for the @xmath79 channel .",

    "the exchange of subleading reggeons ( quark exchange ) could lead to @xmath126 due to isovector contributions . in real photoproduction",
    "the isovector amplitude is known to be rather small @xcite . in dis",
    "the situation may be quite different .",

    "different quark distributions in the proton and neutron lead in this approach to different @xmath79 production cross sections for proton and neutron targets , which obviously leads to a different production rate of charged pions in reactions on the proton and neutron .",
