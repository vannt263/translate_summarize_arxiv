    "symmetry protected topological phases have sprung to the forefront of condensed matter physics .",
    "the impetus for such an explosion of interest began with the theoretical prediction@xcite and observation of two - dimensional topological insulators@xcite in hgte / cdte@xcite and inas / gasb@xcite heterostructures .",
    "from there , the field has now spread to encompass interaction induced topological phases , including in particular fractional topological insulators .",
    "@xcite    topological insulators can be understood as a time - reversal symmetric generalization of a quantum hall state to a bilayer system in which the two layers , physically corresponding to spin up and spin down electrons , act as if they were subject to opposite magnetic fields @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of physics can originate from spin - orbit coupling.@xcite a topological insulator has helical edge modes ( two modes related by time reversal symmetry ) , instead of the chiral edge mode of a quantum hall state ( a single mode whose direction of motion is dictated by the time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field ) .    in the presence of electron - electron interactions , fractionalized versions of topological insulating states have been predicted.@xcite a simple way to generalize the above construction is to imagine that the two spin species each form a fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) state . this situation can be realized in a toy model similar to the one described above . the only new element is a short - range two - body interaction between electrons of the same spin , while electrons of different spin do not interact at all .",
    "this toy model can then be mapped to two decoupled fqh systems of the same filling factor , and subject to opposite magnetic fields.@xcite    more exotic fractional topological insulating phases may occur due to interactions between the two spin species .",
    "so far , a number of time - reversal symmetric phases arising due to complex inter spin interactions have been predicted.@xcite however , it should be kept in mind that , much like the stoner instability of a metal to a spin polarized state , which is driven by exchange interactions , strong interactions between the two spin species in a topological insulator may result in a time - reversal symmetry broken phase .",
    "to address such phases , we study a model of weakly coupled interacting spinful wires .",
    "similar constructions based on arrays of one - dimensional subsystems have proven a powerful approach for the description of integer , fractional , and more exotic quantum hall states,@xcite for the analysis of fractional topological insulators effectively consisting of two decoupled quantum hall layers,@xcite as well as for an alternative general classification of topological states.@xcite experimentally , arrays of coupled quantum wires could for instance be engineered in epitaxially grown multilayer systems using the cleaved edge overgrowth method.@xcite in addition , quantum hall physics have been identified in bechgaard salts,@xcite which consist of effectively two - dimensional arrays of coupled one - dimensional subsystems .",
    "different from the coupled wire construction of a fractional quantum hall state , there is no external magnetic field in the main part of our analysis .",
    "instead , we consider a model with rashba type spin - orbit coupling which increases linearly from wire to wire , mimicking the spin - dependent magnetic field @xmath0 . without interactions between the two spin species ,",
    "this model trivially reproduces the pair of decoupled fqh systems at opposite magnetic fields.@xcite    as a warmup for the construction of topological states with strong interactions between the two spin species , however , we first reconsider double layer quantum hall states at finite magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "these are described by generalizations of laughlin s wave functions suggested by halperin,@xcite and intimately related to the haldane - halperin hierarchy states.@xcite the wave functions are characterized by integers @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 odd , and read @xmath5 here , the magnetic length is @xmath6 , the two layers are labeled by the ( pseudo- ) spin @xmath7 , and the complex numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates of the electrons in the two layers .",
    "the latter have fillings @xmath12 discussed in eq .",
    "below , and contain @xmath13 electrons . the factor @xmath14+i[y_{r\\uparrow}-y_{s\\downarrow}])^{n}$ ]",
    "encodes the inter layer correlations .",
    "the wire construction for these halperin states is formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec : halpering_states ] , reproducing all of their topological properties including filling factors , quasiparticle charges and edge structure .",
    "we then move in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen_halperin ] to the main problem of interest at zero total magnetic field @xmath15 , but with spin - orbit coupling , in which case the two layers , now corresponding to the two spin species , have effectively opposite magnetic fields @xmath16 . repeating the wire construction in this case leads to states that show different properties than the halperin states .",
    "they can , however , still be labeled by three integers @xmath17 with odd @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these integers relate to the filling fractions as @xmath18 note that in our notation both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive , as they are proportional to the respective electron densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the integers @xmath17 should be chosen accordingly . an important implication of eq .",
    "( [ fillingfactor ] ) is that when the two spins ( or layers ) are sufficiently strongly coupled to result in @xmath23 , the two filling factors can be different from each other , @xmath24 , which translates to a finite magnetization . after deriving these states ,",
    "we discuss their physical properties , including the edge structure , bulk quasiparticle excitations , and the associated hall conductivity .",
    "the latter vanishes by symmetry in a time reversal invariant system .",
    "the general states considered in this work , however , have @xmath25 . for a finite @xmath26",
    ", we thus find that the system is either spin polarized , or has a finite hall conductivity , or both .",
    "this indicates that time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken in these states .",
    "similar to the time reversal symmetric case , the edge structure of these states consists of two counter propagating modes .",
    "if one assumes spin conservation ( conservation of @xmath27 ) , these counter propagating edge modes are conserved . in the case of broken time reversal symmetry , and",
    "more generally when @xmath27 is not conserved due to spin - orbit coupling , it is , however , possible to gap out the counter propagating edge modes by perturbations such as impurities .",
    "consider as an example states with @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 , the two spins are decoupled . in this case , @xmath30 correspond to laughlin states for both spins , but at opposite magnetic fields .",
    "for @xmath31 the filling factors are different from each other , and do not correspond to decoupled fqh states for the two spins . in a ( 331 ) state , for example , the total filling of @xmath32 decomposes spontaneously as @xmath33 between the spins .",
    "the choice of the sign of @xmath26 , which does not change the total filling factor , represents the spontaneous symmetry breaking in this state .",
    "besides the finite magnetization , the symmetry breaking also leads to a non - zero hall conductivity @xmath34 . as for the magnetization",
    ", the sign of @xmath35 is given by the sign of @xmath26 .",
    "as a second example , consider states with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where the parity of @xmath38 must be opposite to that of @xmath26 to guarantee that @xmath39 are odd .",
    "for any @xmath26 , the individual filling factors are given by @xmath40 .",
    "let us focus on @xmath41 for concreteness .",
    "for these filling factors , the system could for instance be in a @xmath42 state or a @xmath43 state ( the latter is related by time reversal to the @xmath44 state ) . which of these states is the most stable one depends on the microscopic interactions in the system .",
    "while now , the symmetry breaking is not reflected in a finite spin polarization @xmath45 anymore , it still gives rise to a hall conductivity @xmath46 , which equals @xmath47 for the @xmath43 or @xmath44 states , respectively .",
    "notice that one can also find states with vanishing hall conductivity , but with a finite spin polarization .",
    "those are the @xmath48 states ( with @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , in the general time reversal symmetry broken phases considered here , the hall conductivity or the spin polarization can vanish - but not both of them .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we finally conclude with a comparison to other approaches for fractional topological insulators.@xcite our results are consistent with works based on @xmath49matrix chern - simons theories , which find that only substantially more delicate states may still preserve time reversal symmetry and at the same time have strong correlations between the two spin species .",
    "the significance of our analysis is thus that time reversal broken states are natural competing phases which should be considered in the search for spin - correlated fractional topological insulators .",

    "concentrating on an @xmath17 state , we find that the adiabatic insertion of a @xmath218 flux results in a total pumped charge of @xmath219 , corresponding to the hall conductivity @xmath220 as required , the hall response vanishes in the time reversal symmetric case , @xmath221 , @xmath29 .",

    "the quantum hall and spin hall conductivities can thus be understood as describing the transport of both types of quasiparticles across the sample .",
    "the present situation with counter propagating edge modes raises the question on their stability against impurity scattering . in the presence of an impurity , for instance near the left edge , one may write a term of the form @xmath225 this type of perturbation does not conserve spin .",
    "we do not , however , expect to have such a conservation in a generic system with spin orbit coupling , and even less so in the presence of broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "our specific model has an additional issue : the momentum difference between the states described by @xmath188 and @xmath189 grows with the width of the system .",
    "we believe that this is just a property of the specific model . in sec .  [",
    "sec : negmass ] , we consider an alternative model in which the issue of large momentum difference between edge modes is absent .",

    "instead of using two layers of quantum wires with an effectively opposite magnetic field , local interactions can also stabilize a ( fractional ) topological insulator state in a double layer of wires subject to a homogenous magnetic field if the masses in the two layers are opposite.@xcite this gives rise to the dispersions depicted in fig .",

    "in this work , we have identified and analyzed a generalized class of quantum hall states at zero magnetic field , which can be understood as analogues of fractional topological insulator states with strong correlations between time - reversal partners .",
    "importantly , we find that these states have broken time reversal symmetry , which in general can lead to spin magnetization or to a non - zero hall conductance , or to both .",
    "this suggests the possibility that fractional topological insulators may be unstable towards the formation of a time - reversal symmetry broken state in the presence of sufficiently strong electron - electron interactions .    to close our discussion ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the consistency of our findings with other approaches for fractional topological insulators .",
    "[ ] have analyzed chern - simons theories of time reversal symmetric fractional topological insulators , and inferred that the @xmath124-matrices of these theories should satisfy a number of properties . for a @xmath231 @xmath124-matrix ,",
    "the only possibility is to have vanishing off - diagonal elements , which corresponds to two decoupled copies of a fractional quantum hall state .",
    "a time reversal symmetric state with off - diagonal elements in the @xmath124-matrix , encoding correlations between the time reversal partners , requires the @xmath124-matrix to be larger than @xmath231 .",
    "this is consistent with the family of states that we have found .",
    "these states are characterized by the @xmath231 @xmath124-matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmatrix_soi_2rep ] ) , in which non - vanishing off - diagonal elements imply broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "being characterized by a relatively simple @xmath124-matrix , and not a larger one as discussed for time reversal symmetric states with inter spin correlations,@xcite the states analyzed in this work form alternative candidate time reversal symmetry broken states that should be considered in the on - going search for fractional topological insulators in different models .",
    "one may also ask how our findings fit into the general classification scheme of ref .  [ ] . while the states with time reversal symmetry discussed here ( the @xmath29 or @xmath232 states ) are simply to those analyzed in ref .  [ ] within symmetry class @xmath233 , our spin up - spin down interacting states with @xmath31 belong to symmetry class @xmath234 .",
    "however , they were not discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , which was in this class restricted to the simplest states with single component @xmath235 @xmath49matrices .",
    "the model presented here is strongly anisotropic .",
    "yet , we believe that the resulting phases are ground states of isotropic systems , similar to the wire construction of the fractional quantum hall effect which gives the same physical state described by the laughlin circular symmetric wave function .    few interesting questions and directions remain to be explored .",
    "whereas here we have mainly elaborated on the classification of a family of tr broken states , a microscopic study of a specific model , as well as proposed realizations which can show the emergence of such symmetry broken phases , have not been included in this paper and are left for a future study . also the theory of the phase transition is an interesting issue which was not analyzed here .",
    "indeed one may consider the spin - polarization , or the hall conductivity , both of which vanish in the symmetric phase , and construct an appropriate order parameter .",
    "however , a conventional ginzburg landau theory for spontaneous symmetry breaking can not be sufficient by itself , since an order parameter expressed in terms of the spin - polarization , or the hall conductivity , becomes quantized in the ordered phase .",
    "thus , symmetry breaking and topology conspire to yield a fractionally quantized order parameter .",
    "understanding the nature of the phase transition is left for a future study .",
