    "let @xmath6 be a finite subgroup . according to mckay correspondence , such a subgroup gives rise to a graph @xmath2 which turns out to be an affine dynkin diagram of ade type .",
    "let @xmath7 be the corresponding affine lie algebra .",
    "there are several approaches allowing one to construct @xmath7 from @xmath0 :    1 .",
    "there is a geometric construction , due to nakajima and lusztig , of @xmath7 and its representations in terms of the quiver varieties associated to graph @xmath2 .",
    "these varieties are closely related to the moduli spaces of instantons on the resolution of singularities @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   there is an algebraic construction , due to ringel @xcite , which allows one to get the universal enveloping algebra @xmath9 of the positive part of @xmath7 as the hall algebra of the category @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an orientation of @xmath2 and @xmath10 is the corresponding quiver .",
    "it was shown by peng and xiao @xcite that replacing @xmath4 by the quotient @xmath11 of the corresponding derived category , we can get a description of all of @xmath7 . different choices of orientation give rise to equivalent derived categories @xmath12 , with equivalences given by bernstein - gelfand - ponomarev reflection functors ; in terms of @xmath7 , these functors correspond to the action of the braid group of the corresponding weyl group .",
    "recently , a third approach was suggested by ocneanu @xcite ( unpublished ) , in a closely related setting of a subgroup in quantum @xmath1 , for @xmath13 being a root of unity .",
    "his approach is based on studying essential paths in @xmath14 , where @xmath5 is the order of the root of unity .",
    "this approach is purely combinatorial : all constructions are done using this finite graph and vector spaces of essential paths between points in this graph , without involving any categories at all .",
    "this paper grew out of the author s attempt to understand ocneanu s construction and in particular , find the appropriate categorical interpretation of his combinatorial constructions ; however , for simplicity we do it for subgroups in classical @xmath1 , leaving the analysis of the subgroups in quantum @xmath1 for future papers .",
    "we show that ocneanu s essential paths in @xmath15 have a natural interpretation in terms of the category @xmath16 of @xmath0equivariant @xmath17-modules on @xmath3 ( or , rather , its `` even part '' @xmath18 , for certain natural @xmath19 grading on @xmath16 ) .",
    "this also provides a relation with ringel  lusztig construction : for ( almost ) any choice of orientation @xmath5 of @xmath2 , we construct an equivalence of triangulated categories @xmath20 these equivalences agree with the equivalences of @xmath21 for different choices of @xmath5 given by reflection functors . as a corollary",
    ", we see that the grothendieck group @xmath22 is an affine root lattice , and the set @xmath23 of classes of indecomposable modules is an affine root system .",
    "this construction of the affine root system via equivariant sheaves has a number of remarkable properties , namely :    1 .",
    "this does not require a choice of orientation of @xmath2 ( unlike the category @xmath21 , where we first choose an orientation and then prove that the resulting derived category is independent of orientation ) .",
    "2 .   the indecomposable objects in the category @xmath16 can be explicitly described .",
    "namely , they are the sheaves @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are irreducible representations of @xmath0 ( these sheaves and their translations correspond to real roots of @xmath7 ) and torsion sheaves , whose support is a @xmath0orbit in @xmath3 ( in particular , torsion sheaves whose support is an orbit of a generic point correspond to imaginary roots of @xmath7 ) .",
    "3 .   this construction of the affine root system does not give a natural polarization into negative and positive roots .",
    "instead , it gives a canonical coxeter element in the corresponding affine weyl group , which is given by @xmath26=[{\\mathcal{f}}{\\otimes}{\\mathcal{o}}(-2)]$ ] ( this also corresponds to the auslander ",
    "reiten functor @xmath27 ) .",
    "4 .   this construction gives a bijection of the vertices of the affine dynkin diagram @xmath2 and ( some of ) the @xmath28-orbits in @xmath23 ( as opposed to the quiver construction , where vertices of @xmath2 are in bijection with the simple positive roots ) .",
    "for @xmath29 ( which is essentially equivalent to @xmath30 ) , these results were first obtained in the paper @xcite , where it was shown that the corresponding hall algebra contains the subalgebra isomorphic to @xmath31 . this paper in turn was inspired by an earlier paper of kapranov @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that many of the results obtained here have already been proved in other ways .",
    "most importantly , it had been proved by lenzing @xcite that the derived category of equivariant sheaves on @xmath3 is equivalent to the derived category of representation of the corresponding quiver ; this result has been used by schiffmann @xcite for construction of a subalgebra in the corresponding affine lie algebra via hall algebra of the category of equivariant sheaves . however , the construction of equivalence in @xcite is different than the one suggested here .",
    "the primary difference is that in lenzing s construction , the dynkin diagram @xmath2 is constructed as the star diagram , with lengths of branches determined by the branching points of the cover @xmath32 , and he uses a standard orientation of this diagram . in the construction presented here , the diagram is @xmath2 is defined in a more standard way , using the set @xmath33 of irreducible representations of @xmath0 ; more importantly , we construct not a single equivalence but a collection of equivalences , one for each admissible orientation . in lenzing s",
    "construction , torsion sheaves naturally play a major role ; in our construction , we concentrate on the study of locally free sheaves .    lenzing",
    "s results apply not only to @xmath34 but to a much larger class of `` non - commutative projective curves '' . however , the downside of this is that the language he uses is rather technical , making his papers somewhat hard for non - experts . for this reason ,",
    "we had chosen to give independent proofs of some of the results , thus saving the reader the necessity of learning the language of non - commutative curves .",
    "of course , we tried to clearly mark the results which had already been known .",
