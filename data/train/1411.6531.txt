    "cancer progression is commonly viewed as a cellular microevolutionary process @xcite .",
    "genomic instability , which seems to be a common trait in most types of cancer @xcite , is a key factor responsible for tumor progression since allows a darwinian exploratory process required to overcome selection barriers . by displaying either high levels of mutation or chromosomal aberrations",
    ", cancer cells can generate a progeny of highly diverse phenotypes able to evade such barriers @xcite .",
    "genomic instability refers to an increased tendency of alterations in the genome during the life cycle of cells .",
    "normal cells display a very low rate of mutation ( @xmath0 changes per nucleotide and replication cycle ) .",
    "hence , it has been proposed that the spontaneous mutation rate in normal cells is not sufficient to account for the large number of mutations found in human cancers .",
    "indeed , studies of mutation frequencies in microbial populations , in both experimentally induced stress and clinical cases , reveal that mutations that inactivate mismatch repair genes result in @xmath1 times the background mutation rate @xcite .",
    "also , unstable tumors exhibiting the so - called mutator phenotype @xcite have rates that are at least two orders of magnitude higher than in normal cells @xcite .",
    "this difference leads to cumulative mutations and increased levels of genetic change associated to further failures in genome maintenance mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the amount of instability is , however , limited by too high levels of instability , which have been suggested to exist in tumor progression @xcite , thus indicating that thresholds for instability must exist .",
    "in fact , many anti - cancer therapies take indirectly advantage of increased genomic instability , as is the case of mitotic spindle alteration by taxol or dna damage by radiation or by alkilating agents .",
    "the mutator phenotype is the result of mutations in genes which are responsible of preserving genomic stability , e.g. , brca1 ( breast cancer 1 ) , blm ( bloom syndrome protein ) , atm ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) or gene protein p53 ( which is involved in multitude of cellular pathways involved in cell cycle control , dna repair , among others ) .",
    "this mutator phenotype undergoes increases in mutation rates and can accelerate genetic evolution in cancer cells that can ultimately drive to tumor progression @xcite . as mentioned , genomic instability is a major driving force in tumorigenesis .",
    "tumorigenesis can be viewed as a process of cellular microevolution in which individual preneoplastic or tumor cells acquire mutations that can increase proliferative capacity and thus confer a selective advantage in terms of growth speed .",
    "the rate of replication of tumor cells can increase due to mutations in both tumor suppressor genes , e.g. , apc ( adenomatous polyposis coli ) or p53 ; and oncogenes , e.g. , ras ( rat sarcoma ) or src .",
    "tumor suppressor genes protect cells from one step on the path to cancer and oncogenes are genes that , when mutated , have the potential to cause cancer . in terms of population dynamics , alterations in both types of genes drive to neoplastic process through increases in cancer cells numbers .",
    "mutations in replication - related genes that confer an increase of fitness and thus a selective advantage are named driver mutations @xcite .",
    "this evolutionary process allows tumor cells to escape the restrictions that limit growth of normal cells , such as the constraints imposed by the immune system , adverse metabolic conditions or cell cycle checkpoints .",
    "the iterative process of mutation and selection underlying tumor growth and evolution promotes the generation of a diverse pool of tumor cells carrying different mutations and chromosomal abnormalities . in this sense",
    ", it has been suggested that the high mutational capacity of tumor cells , together with an increase of proliferation rates , may generate a highly diverse population of tumor cells similar to a quasispecies @xcite .",
    "a quasispecies is a  cloud \" of genetically related genomes around the so - called master sequence , which is at the mutation - selection equilibrium @xcite . due to the heterogeneous population structure , selection does not act on a single mutant but on the quasispecies as a whole .",
    "the most prominent examples of a quasispecies are given by rna viruses ( e.g. hepatitis c virus @xcite , vesicular stomatitis virus @xcite , the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 @xcite , among others ) .",
    "an important concept in quasispecies theory is the so - called error threshold @xcite .",
    "the error threshold is a phenomenon that involves the loss of information at high mutation rates .",
    "according to eigen s original formulation , a quasispecies can remain at equilibrium despite high mutation rates , but the surpass of the critical mutation rate will upset this balance since the master sequence itself disappears and its genetic information is lost due to the accumulation of errors .",
    "it has been suggested that many rna viruses replicate near the error threshold @xcite .",
    "another important concept in quasispecies theory is lethal mutagenesis . as a difference from the error threshold ( which is a shift in sequence space ) ,",
    "lethal mutagenesis is a process of demographic extinction due to an unbearable number of mutations @xcite .",
    "most basically , it requires that deleterious mutations are happening often enough that the population can not maintain itself , but it is otherwise no different from any other extinction process in which fitness is not great enough for one generation of individuals to fully replace themselves in the next generation . in simple words ,",
    "increased mutagenesis could impair the maintainance of a quasispecies due to the crossing of the error threshold or due to lethal mutagenesis .",
    "quasispecies theory has provided a population - based framework for understanding rna viral evolution @xcite .",
    "these viruses replicate at extremely high mutation rates and exhibit significant genetic diversity .",
    "this diversity allows a viral population to rapidly adapt to dynamic environments and evolve resistance to vaccines and antiviral drugs .",
    "as we previously mentioned , several features have been suggested to be shared between rna viruses and tumors @xcite , at least qualitatively .",
    "one is the presence of high levels of heterogeneity , both at genotype and phenotype levels . typically , cancer cells suffer mutations affecting cell communication , growth and apoptosis ( i.e. , programmed cell death ) .",
    "accordingly , escape from the immune system ( and other selection barriers ) operates in both rna viruses and tumors .",
    "viruses use antigenic diversity whereas tumors evade the immune system by loosing their antigens through mutation , or making use of antigenic modulation and/or tumor - induced immune suppression .",
    "even more , similarly to rna viruses , genetic instability in cancer cells will have detrimental effects on cells fitness , since most random mutations are likely to be harmful . as indicated by cahill et al .",
    "@xcite , the best chance of cure advanced cancers might be a result of tumor genetic instability : cancer cells are more sensitive to stress - inducing agents . in this sense , possible therapies increasing mutation of tumor cells could push this populations towards the error threshold or induce lethal mutagenesis .",
    "this is the topic that we will address in this work by using a mathematical model describing the dynamics of competition between different cell populations with different levels of genomic instability .",
    "specifically , we will find equilibrium points , characterizing their stability , focusing on possible changes in the stability as a function of the mutation rate and the fitness of cells populations .",
    "we will also investigate the transient times of the system to reach a given equilibrium state .",
    "each of the mathematical results will be given in terms of the mutation rates or the replication fidelity of the cells .",
    "this is important to understand how tumor populations behave .",
    "as we previously mentioned , unstable cells may reach an error threshold and start loosing genetic information until its population decreases or , even more , disappears .",
    "we will see how mutation rates affect this error threshold .",
    "furthermore , we will see how they affect to the velocity of the tumor population to reach an equilibrium point , which is interesting since mutation rates can be modified through drugs ( similarly to rna viruses @xcite ) or radiotherapy .",
    "in this section we introduce the model by sol and deisboeck @xcite , which describes the competitive behaviour between cell populations with different levels of genomic instability .",
    "the model is given by the following set of differential equations :     represents anomalous growth but low genomic instability , and both @xmath2 and @xmath3 have larger genomic instabilities ( see section [ model ] for a description of the model parameters ) . ]",

    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 denote the fraction of each population and , therefore , the sum of all these variables must be exactly one , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the probability of mutation from @xmath2 to @xmath6 can be denoted by @xmath9 and is given by @xmath10 .",
    "notice that @xmath11 .",
    "coefficients @xmath12 denote the mutation rate ( or probability ) from @xmath13 to @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of error - free replication of @xmath6 is represented by @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , cross - mutations connect the different subclones of @xmath3 through the term @xmath15 , being @xmath16 the growth rate of each population and @xmath17 the growth rate of each subpopulation of @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath16 and @xmath17 are known as the fitness of each population .",
    "the greater is the fitness of a population , the greater is its replicative rate . finally , the term @xmath18 is the average fitness of the population vector @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 is also known as the  constant population constraint \" and it ensures that the population remains constant , also introducing competition between the three populations of cells . although the model does not explicitly consider environmental constraints , such as blood supply , hypoxia or acidosis , they can be considered as implicitly introduced through the set @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "population @xmath5 mutates to @xmath2 with a probability of @xmath22 . in the same way",
    ", @xmath2 mutates in different @xmath6-sequences with a probability @xmath23 . in both cases , @xmath24 , being @xmath25 and @xmath26 the copying fidelity during replication for @xmath5 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "so , in this model , mutations from @xmath2 to @xmath5 and from @xmath6 to @xmath2 have not been considered .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the model with @xmath27 is the two - variable quasispecies model @xcite .",
    "+ the set of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) can also be written in a matricial way :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 +   + so , if we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the following matrices @xmath33 + then @xmath31 is a markov matrix by columns .",
    "this means that @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "this kind of matrix appears in mathematical models in biology @xcite , economics ( e.g. , the markov switching multifractal asset pricing model @xcite ) , telephone networks ( the viterbi algorithm for error corrections @xcite ) or `` rankings '' as the pagerank algorithm from google @xcite .",
    "therefore , the system can be rewritten as : @xmath36 our approach to this problem consists on assuming @xmath37 behaves as an average variable @xmath38 @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "this assumption allows the analysis of a more general scenario where population @xmath2 can produce @xmath3 by mutation , and where @xmath3 can have different fitness properties depending on the selected values of both @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",

    ", we fix a value for @xmath119 and move @xmath124 .",
    "we have chosen a value for @xmath119 corresponding to the line @xmath130 of the diagram in fig  [ fixpoints ] .",
    "observe that , when moving at the green zone our equilibrium point is of the form @xmath170 while it is of the form @xmath171 when we move along the blue one .",
    "for each equilibrium point , whose components depend on @xmath124 , we compute its differential matrix and its associated eigenvalues .",
    "these eigenvalues , computed numerically as mentioned above , are plotted in fig .",
    "they are all three real , and thus no transient oscillations are found in the dynamics .",
    "observe that there is an interchange of the number of positive and negative eigenvalues around the bifurcation value @xmath102 , but no change in their stability .",
    "they are always unstable since we have at least one positive eigenvalue .",
    "it is interesting to highlight the change in the geometry of such equilibrium point : for values of @xmath124 under the bifurcation value @xmath102 its invariant stable manifold is @xmath144-dimensional and its invariant unstable manifold @xmath77-dimensional ; on the contrary , after the bifurcation the associated dimensions of the invariant manifolds are exchanged . in both cases ,",
    "the orbit starting at initial conditions @xmath172 finishes at the stable manifold of that equilibrium point .",
    "this is why , although being a unstable fixed point , the trajectory under analysis asymptotically travels towards the fixed point .      in this section",
    "we analyze the time taken by the system to reach a given ( small ) distance to one of the fixed points found in section [ se : eqpoints ] .",
    "typically , the behaviour of transient times change near bifurcation threshold , and , particularly for our system , we are interested in possible changes in transients due to changes in mutation rates",
    ". these phenomena could be relevant in patient response under mutagenic therapy .",
    "figure 7 shows the same as fig .",
    "[ fixpoints ] , in the sense that we tune the same parameters of the system , but now we compute the transient times .",
    "here we use the same method to integrate the ode system , but taking into account only the time taken to reach a distance @xmath173 of the equilibrium point . notice that if we observe the contour lines represented at the bottom of fig .  [ time ] we have the same as in fig .  [ fixpoints ] .",
    "this means that the  time to equilibrium \" of the system increases when we are near bifurcation points , which are represented with black lines in fig .",
    "[ fixpoints ] .",
    "when slightly modifying the mutation rate of @xmath2 near the error threshold , we see that the time taken by the tumor to reach an equilibrium state is significantly lower . in particular , when increasing the mutation rate , not only time decreases but also we see that the tumor reaches an equilibrium point where the stable cells population is higher .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ merge ] , where red , green and blue lines represent @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively and the dashed , orange line represents the transient time , which is rescaled to be able to relate it with the corresponding equilibrium point . in case of possible mutagenic therapies directly targeting the most unstable cells ,",
    "our results reveal that pushing mutation rates of unstable cells beyond the error threshold ( where @xmath5 population starts increasing and @xmath3 population starts decreasing ) the achievement of the equilibrium point would be very fast , and no further increase of mutation rates may be needed to achieve a faster response ( notice that the transient time for @xmath174 in fig .  [ time ]",
    "does not significantly decrease for smaller @xmath124 values ) .",
    "in other words , when rescaling fig .",
    "[ time ] ( b ) in terms of logarithm in base 10 ( as we can see in fig .",
    "[ merge ] ) if we increase the mutation rate of @xmath2 , time decreases faster than an exponential function , which is interesting result since it implies an equilibrium scenario with a dominant presence of @xmath5 that can be reached in a short time .",
    "in this article we study an ode system modeling the behavior of a population of tumor cells with a mean - field quasispecies model introduced by sol and deisboeck @xcite .",
    "thus , in our simplified model we have assumed the following : the model does not consider stochasticity and does not take into account spatial correlations between cells as well .",
    "also , we do not consider cell death ( due to e.g. , the immune system ) , otherwise we model competition in terms of replication and mutation using the quasispecies framework @xcite .",
    "first , we have found the fixed points of the system analytically and we have studied their stability both analytically and numerically .",
    "we have also characterized the bifurcations between the different fixed points .",
    "we conclude that , depending on the parameters , the system can reach different equilibrium states one of them involving low populations of tumor cells while keeping large populations of genetically stable cells .",
    "this scenario can be achieved by increasing the level of genetic instability conferred through the mutation rate @xmath51 of the mutator - phenotype population @xmath2 .",
    "if this mutation rate exceeds an error threshold , the replication rate of the more malignant subpopulation @xmath3 is reduced to a point where it has no longer competitive advantage .",
    "further analysis of the effects of mutation rate @xmath51 on the dynamics of the system have allowed us to characterize a transcritical bifurcation .",
    "under such a bifurcation , the time taken by the system to reach the desired equilibrium state is shown to drastically decrease with slight changes in the mutation rate @xmath51 near the error threshold .",
    "this result can give us a clue about how medication and therapy may affect the tumor behavior in case of direct mutagenic therapies against tumor cells .",
    "in other words , it is possible to modify the mutation rate of the cells through therapy , and we have seen that if we slightly increase the mutation rate of @xmath2 near the error threshold we can obtain an equilibrium point with a dominant population of stable cells rapidly . such an scenario could become relevant since populations of tumor cells could be decreased with mutagenic therapy , and such populations could be more prone to extinction due to stochastic fluctuations inherent to small populations sizes",
    ".    further research should explicitly consider stochastic fluctuations by transforming the differential equations in stochastic differential equations e.g. , langevin equations .",
    "also , the addition of spatial correlations would indicate if our results are still present in theoretical models for solid tumors . in this sense",
    ", it would be interesting to analyze the transient times tied to increasing mutation values considering space in an explicit manner .",
    "it is important to notice that transient times are extremely important in terms of responses velocities after therapy .",
    "different causes and mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in transient duration , which have been especially explored for ecological systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is known that space can involve very long transients until equilibrium points are reached .",
    "this phenomenon could be investigated extending the model we investigated by means of partial differential equations .",
