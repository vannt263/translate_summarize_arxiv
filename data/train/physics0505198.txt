    "<S> optical microcavities based on zero - group - velocity surface modes in photonic crystal slabs are studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that high quality factors can be easily obtained for such microcavities in photonic crystal slabs . with increasing of the cavity length , the quality factor is gradually enhanced and the resonant frequency converges to that of the zero - group - velocity surface mode in the photonic crystal . the number of the resonant modes with high quality factors is mainly determined by the number of surface modes with zero - group velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> optical microcavities have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in many various fields , such as ultrasmall optical filters , high efficiency light emission diodes , low threshold lasers , nonlinear optics and quantum information precessing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all applications require microcavities to confine light strongly and densely , that is , microcavities should have both a high - quality factor @xmath0 and small modal volume @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> total internal reflection and/or bragg reflection are generally used for light confinement . for the smaller cavity </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 is greatly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> one of the best approaches to resolve the problem is the extension of the bragg reflection in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) or a three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic crystal ( phc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been also shown that extremely small - mode - volume high-@xmath0 microcavities can be realized by 2d phc slabs @xcite , owing to strong optical confinement for both the in - plane and vertical direction .    </S>",
    "<S> surface waves are propagating electromagnetic waves , which are bound to the interface between materials and free space . </S>",
    "<S> for dielectric interfaces , they usually do not exist on dielectric materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the existence of photonic band gaps , it has been shown that dielectric phcs may support surface waves for some cases , e.g. , a truncated or deformed structure at the interface @xcite . in the present letter , we study phc microcavities utilizing surface modes with zero - group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> though the concepts apply for all phcs , for simplicity , only surface resonant modes in 2d phc slabs are considered in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> these cavities are open cavities in the sense that one of the in - plane boundaries is exposed to exterior . </S>",
    "<S> although the similar structure has been realized by yang et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally @xcite , the dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency to the cavity length has not been analyzed yet .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider a 2d square phc slab with dielectric rods in air . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity of the rods is @xmath2 , the height of the rods is @xmath3 , and the radius of the rods is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> surface defects at the interface are introduced by reducing the radius of rods ( @xmath6 ) , the top view of which is illustrated in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation for the reduced - radii rod - slab transverse magnetic ( tm ) surface modes is calculated using the 3d finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite and is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) , where the shadow regions are the projected band structure for tm modes . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) that such a surface structure only supports one surface mode . </S>",
    "<S> group velocity governed by @xmath7 for the surface mode is zero for the wave vector @xmath8 ( mode a ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose an optical microcavity that is composed by the 2d square phc slab , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the grey rods , acting as reflecting mirrors in the @xmath9 direction , are the same as those interior rods . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the cavity is denoted by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> surface modes can go through the central surface but are terminated by the reflecting mirror . </S>",
    "<S> only the mode for obeying the fabry - perot condition ( the round - trip accumulated phase @xmath11 is a multiple of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the phase shift associated with reflection from the boundary ) will stay in the cavity for a long time , i.e. , become a surface resonant mode . </S>",
    "<S> for such a microcavity , with no absorption by the material , the quality factor @xmath0 is mainly determined by the reflection loss at the interface between the surface defect rods and the mirror rods .    </S>",
    "<S> quality factors and resonant frequencies of surface resonant modes are analyzed by the 3d fdtd method @xcite with a boundary treatment of perfectly matched layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we excite the surface mode with a gaussian pulse and then monitor the radiative decay of the field . the frequencies @xmath14 and quality factors @xmath0 of the resonant modes are calculated using a combination of fdtd techniques and pad approximation with baker s algorithm @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) , we show the electric field cross sections of a high-@xmath0 surface resonant mode for the square phc slab cavity with the length of @xmath15 . figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) depicts horizontal and vertical cross sections of the electric - field @xmath16 component at the center plane of third axis ( @xmath17 ) and at the plane center of the surface defects , where the dotted line represents the position of the surface defect rods with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the mode has an angular frequency @xmath18 and quality factor @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be clearly seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) that the resonant mode is really governed by wave vector @xmath8 , which is consistent with what we analyzed above .    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) , one can see that the electric field is almost concentrated in the centers of the defect rods . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the reflection phase shift @xmath13 is close to @xmath23 , which is roughly independent of the cavity length @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the cavity modes can be related to surface modes which satisfy @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an integer ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results also show that the quality factor of the resonant mode corresponding to @xmath8 , i.e. , zero - group - velocity surface mode , is order of magnitude larger than those of cavity modes with other @xmath27 vectors . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 values for such a cavity mode with different cavity length are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) that @xmath0 gradually increases as the cavity length becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> our results also show , with increasing of the cavity length , that the angular frequency of the surface resonant mode converges to @xmath28 , corresponding to that with the zero - group - velocity surface mode in the phc slab .    </S>",
    "<S> let us next consider a triangular phc slab with air holes extending through a high - index ( @xmath2 ) finite - height dielectric slab , the top view of which is shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the holes have a radius of @xmath29 , while the high - index slab is of thickness @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between right boundary and the centers of the first right holes is @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation for such a triangular phc slab transverse electric ( te ) surface modes is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) , where the shadow regions are the projected band structure for te modes . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) that there exist three surface mode curves in the triangular phc slab . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider the angular frequency between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where there is one surface mode in a large region . </S>",
    "<S> two zero - group - velocity surface modes ( mode a with @xmath34 and mode b with @xmath35 ) can be found in our considered frequency region . </S>",
    "<S> now , imagine an optical cavity composed by such a 2d triangular phc slab , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reflecting mirrors in the @xmath9 direction are introduced by enlarging the radius of surface holes to @xmath36 , together with the dielectric background . using the method mentioned above , we do find two high - quality - factor surface resonant modes with the cavity length of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the modes ( corresponding to mode a ) has a resonant angular frequency @xmath38 , @xmath39 and another ( corresponding to mode b ) is @xmath40 , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig3 ] ( b ) and [ fig3 ] ( c ) show the magnetic - field cross sections for the two resonant modes with the frequency of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the upper and bottom figure represent the horizontal and vertical cross sections of the magnetic field at the center plane of third axis ( @xmath17 ) and at the vertical @xmath44 plane ( the distance between surface boundary and the plane is @xmath45 ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , when the cavity length increases , the frequencies of the resonant modes converge to those two surface modes with zero - group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath0 values fluctuate as the cavity length @xmath10 increases , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , where the diamond line and the asterisk line represent the results for modes a and b , respectively . as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath0 should be enhanced when @xmath11 is a multiple of @xmath12 . due to the complicated reflection interfaces , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , the reflection phase shift @xmath13 is not close to @xmath23 for the both modes , different from the case of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the cavity length with numbers of lattice constant , @xmath46 is not anymore close to a multiple of @xmath12 for the mode b with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> peaks of @xmath0 appear when @xmath48 is close to a multiple of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of peaks for the mode a are different with those for the mode b , mainly arisen from the different wave vectors for the two resonant modes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 reaches at @xmath50 when @xmath51 and @xmath52 is @xmath53 when @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> if the cavity length is further increased , @xmath0 values will again fluctuate but in average increasing .    in this letter , we study optical microcavities based on surface modes in phcs . </S>",
    "<S> high quality factors can be obtained for microcavities based on zero - group - velocity surface modes . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the influence of the microcavity length to the quality factor and resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that , with increasing of the cavity length , the quality factor is gradually enhanced and resonant angular frequency converges to @xmath28 , corresponding to that for the zero - group - velocity surface mode in phcs . the number of the resonant modes with high quality factors is mainly determined by the number of surface modes with zero - group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that surface plasmons exist on a metal - dielectric interface . </S>",
    "<S> we believe similar ideas can be applied to a metallic structure to obtain surface resonant modes .    </S>",
