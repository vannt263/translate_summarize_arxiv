    "self - propelled particles ( spp ) , also called swimmers , are entities that consume internal energy to generate motion @xcite .",
    "they are usually associated with motile microorganisms , artificial ( janus ) micro - particles and flocking animals .",
    "physical models that simulate such particles are divided between flocking ( vicsek model ) @xcite , and angular brownian motion ( abm ) types @xcite ( which also includes run - and - tumble dynamics - rtd @xcite ) . among the characteristics of these systems",
    "are the spontaneous appearance of motion orientational order @xcite and giant number fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it was seen that spp are capable of turning gears and produce net work on large objects @xcite , provided that there is an intrinsic asymmetry in such objects . also , it is possible to separate spp based on their rotational diffusion @xcite .",
    "in addition to these phenomena , particle motion rectification was shown to occur when spp are in the presence of funnel - shaped channels @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that self - propelled rods can be trapped by moving barriers similar to funnel channels @xcite .",
    "finally , volpe _",
    "et al_. @xcite showed that it is possible to sort swimmers using a periodic array of convex obstacles ( ellipses ) and an external drift force .    in all these investigations",
    "medium asymmetry is a crucial ingredient for rectification to take place , and it is due to the broken time - symmetry @xcite in particle - obstacle interactions . in this letter , we report a rectification effect similar to the one seen in refs . [ ] for concave obstacles , but here employing periodic arrays of either symmetric ( circles ) or asymmetric ( half - circles ) _ convex _ obstacles ( which presents no cavity in which particles may be trapped in ) , _ without _ the influence of any external drift force .",
    "we argue that the use of convex obstacles produces two distinct types of steady states : @xmath0 ) in the half - circle case , there is transport of particles with a non - zero mean drift velocity ( also found in arrays of funnel objects @xcite ) and a constant density profile ; @xmath1 ) in the circle case , we observe a variable particle density profile and a zero drift velocity ( no transport ) . here",
    ", we will show only detailed results regarding the half - circle case , postponing the circle case for future work .",
    "our results point to the possibility to devise sorting devices based on regular arrays of solid , convex obstacles .",
    "our model is of abm type and consists of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system with @xmath2 swimmers in a @xmath3 box , in which there is an array of @xmath4 static obstacles arranged in a square lattice with unit cell length ( ucl ) @xmath5 .",
    "the obstacles are circles or half - circles of diameter @xmath6 . unless it is explicitly stated the normal direction to the flat side of the half - circles",
    "is the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the swimmers are modeled as soft disks of diameter @xmath8 , which interact through linear springs of stiffness @xmath9 .",
    "there is no specific inter - particle and particle - obstacle alignment rules @xcite .",
    "the swimmers move with a self - propelling velocity @xmath10 , whose random direction , @xmath11 , is proportional to a gaussian white noise @xmath12 , which satisfies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the noise intensity , and @xmath16 the time step .",
    "the particles follow a dynamics similar to the one presented in ref . [ ] , i. e. , there is no thermal brownian motion",
    ". interactions with obstacles are also of the linear spring form , but with a stiffness constant @xmath17 , in order to approximate the rigid body limit .",
    "the equations of motion for swimmer @xmath0 are written , in the overdampped case , as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the particle motility , @xmath20 is the total force in particle @xmath0 ( sum is over @xmath21 particles and obstacles ) , @xmath22 , if @xmath23 ( @xmath24 otherwise ) , and @xmath25 is the overlap distance between disk @xmath0 and object ( disk or obstacle ) @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for particle - particle ( particle - obstacle ) contact ( for a contact with the flat side of a half - circle , @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 is the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "lengths are given in terms of the particle diameter @xmath8 and the time unit is set by @xmath31 .",
    "other parameter values are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in all simulations we employed periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in both @xmath37 and @xmath38directions .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using a second order , stochastic runge - kutta algorithm @xcite .",
    "the rectification effect is characterized by the mean drift velocity @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , which is studied in terms of the ucl of the obstacle lattice ( @xmath5 ) , the obstacle size ( @xmath6 ) , the angular noise magnitude ( @xmath15 ) , and the area fraction ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the latter is the ratio between the area occupied by the spp and the area available to them , i. e. , @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the area covered by the obstacles .",
    "notice that @xmath41 is related to the density @xmath44 of spp , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "we start by discussing qualitatively how the presence of convex obstacles affects the dynamics of the swimmers . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the average velocity field and the corresponding snapshot configuration in systems with a single obstacle .",
    "common features are that particles aggregate around the obstacles , and they follow a vortex - type motion around the curved surfaces with a direction ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) chosen spontaneously .",
    "notice that the swimmers strongly overlap near the obstacle boundaries , rendering very dense clusters there .",
    "this occurs due to the low value of the hardness of the linear spring interaction , @xmath9 .",
    "larger @xmath9 values yields weaker contact overlaps , since particles repel each other more strongly , although there would be still a large number of particles close to the obstacle .",
    "care should be taken , though , when increasing the value of @xmath9 regarding the value of the time step @xmath16 : it should be decreased when @xmath9 is increased , so that two swimmers do not overlap , even modestly , when they perform their inherent displacement , @xmath46 , since the repulsive force would be very large , forcing particles large distances apart in a single time step .",
    "the velocity fields in figs . [",
    "fig1](b ) and [ fig1](d ) were measured for distinct time intervals , the former being @xmath47 times longer than the latter .",
    "we observe that , although particles attach to the obstacles , the vortex motion is sustained only on the circular one . in the half - circle obstacle ,",
    "the vortices quickly die out , since there is a very small probability for spp to change their motion sharply to follow the flat side when emerging from the curved side .",
    "on top of that , particles already in the flat side provide an additional barrier that prevent the vortex to form . in our model",
    ", we do not consider hydrodynamic interactions ( which is believed to be responsible for the motions observed in ref . ) , which could force the disks to attach to the solid surfaces .",
    "in fact , we observed that a single swimmer trajectory in a lattice of half - circles differs little qualitatively from a trajectory realized in a lattice of circles with the same initial conditions .",
    "we checked such results for several values of the noise intensity ( @xmath48 ) and ucl of the obstacle lattice ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "since there can be no net transport in a lattice with circular obstacle ( it is completely symmetric ) , a single swimmer would not yield a non - vanishing current in a lattice of half - circles .",
    "therefore , these features appear only as a collective effect , where contacts among the swimmers are key to clustering @xcite .",
    "notice that aggregation is facilitated by the convex obstacles , since we always observed some degree of clustering around them .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -direction , @xmath50 for ( a ) circular and ( b ) half - circular obstacles . in both cases",
    "the obstacle diameter is @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the cumulative distributions for positive @xmath54 ( solid lines ) and negative @xmath55 ( dot - dashed lines ) displacements in the lattice of half - circle obstacles are shown as inset in ( b ) for @xmath56 ( black ) and @xmath57 ( red , grey ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    in order to gain additional insight of the stationary state , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the normalized probability function for a particle to perform a horizontal displacement @xmath50 in a lattice of obstacles as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the curves were obtained in the long time limit , enough for a particle to cover a distance equivalent to @xmath58 . in general , the curves are more narrowed and peaked around @xmath59 for smaller @xmath5 , which means that more particles have their motion more restricted for denser lattices as a consequence of the accumulation of particles around the obstacles ( aggregates ) . the probability for",
    "a particle to be caught in a given aggregate is proportional to the size of the aggregate .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the aggregate size depends on the density of particles , obstacle size , and noise intensity , but not on @xmath5 ( we also checked the dependence of the aggregate size on @xmath15 by measuring the density profile around the obstacles , and found that it decreases with increasing @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , while decreasing @xmath5 , and keeping all the other parameters constant , the aggregates approach each other , decreasing the free space for the spp to move , and restricting their long time displacement .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we also notice that @xmath50 depends on the shape of the obstacles . for half - circles , [ fig2](b ) , the curves are non - symmetric regarding @xmath59 , implying a preferred direction in the motion of the spp ( rectification ) .",
    "quantitatively , in the case of half - circle obstacles the cumulative distribution for positive displacements , @xmath54 , inset fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , black curves , is larger than the one for negative displacements , @xmath55 red ( grey ) curves , which indicates that particles drift in the @xmath7 direction , producing a steady particle current .",
    "the difference between these two cumulative distributions is a measure of the strength of the particle current , and it increases with decreasing @xmath5 . the probability function for displacements along the @xmath60-direction @xmath61 is essentially indistinguishable for both obstacle shapes due to the symmetry along the @xmath60-direction .    from the previous discussions we learn that : @xmath0 )",
    "spps present a vortex - type motion around convex symmetric obstacles even in the absence of hydrodynamic effects .",
    "such a motion is not observed for a single spp , but it is a consequence of the aggregation of spps around the obstacles ; @xmath1 ) a steady particle current rises spontaneously in a lattice of non - symmetric convex obstacles , and in the absence of an external field .",

    "[ fig3](a ) we present @xmath62 as a function of the noise @xmath15 for @xmath56 , three distinct area fractions @xmath52 ( black squares ) , @xmath68 ( red circles ) , and @xmath69 ( green triangles ) , and two different obstacle sizes , @xmath51 ( solid symbols ) and @xmath70 ( open symbols ) .",
    "the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath62 is fairly insensitive to @xmath41 . in general ,",
    "low noise favors higher @xmath62 ( which seems to reach a plateau for @xmath72 ) , while @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , we observe that @xmath62 increases with increasing obstacle size @xmath6 , but this is noticeable only for small noise ( @xmath75 ) . for large noise values ( @xmath76 )",
    "@xmath62 presents little dependence on both @xmath41 ( related to the density of spps ) and @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , @xmath62 is presented as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath52 , two distinct values of the noise @xmath77 ( black squares ) , and @xmath78 ( red circles ) , and obstacle size @xmath51 ( solid symbols ) , and @xmath63 ( open symbols ) . for large noise ( @xmath79 ) ,",
    "the drift velocity vanishes for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "such a behavior was also observed for the other values of @xmath41 considered in figs . [ fig3](a ) . for small noise ( @xmath77 ) , the drift velocity @xmath80 , and it increases with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "we showed earlier that large noise disfavors aggregation , while small noise favors the accumulation of spp around the obstacles . since the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a),(b ) relate higher @xmath62 with smaller @xmath15 , and smaller @xmath5 or larger @xmath6 , our findings indicate that cluster formation around the obstacles is essential for the occurrence of rectification ( particle current ) @xcite .",
    "the drift velocity increases with increasing @xmath6 ( and decreasing @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 can be enhanced by bringing the obstacles closer ( since decreasing @xmath5 is equivalent to increasing @xmath6 ) .",
    "this trend is due to the overlapping of neighboring aggregates , which forces more particles in the + x direction .",
    "up to here we considered the flat face of the half - circle obstacles perpendicular to the @xmath64-direction . in order to show the possibility to control the direction of the particle current , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) both @xmath62 ( black squares ) and @xmath66 ( red circles ) as functions of the angle @xmath65 between @xmath81 and the @xmath64-direction [ see inset in fig . [ fig3](c ) ] .",
    "the results clearly indicates the possibility to control the direction of the particle current by changing the orientation of the obstacles .",
    "notice that @xmath62 and @xmath66 have , approximately , inverse variations with @xmath65 , which indicates that the drift velocity is in a direction close to that of @xmath81 .",
    "our previous results and discussions indicate that no steady particle current ( i. e. , @xmath82 ) exists in a regular array of circular obstacles .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to induce rectification in the motion of spp using this type of obstacle .",
    "since medium asymmetry is essential for the motion rectification to occur , we can build a 2d square lattice of circular obstacles whose diameters are increasing functions of @xmath64 in order to produce such asymmetry . that this type asymmetry will lead to motion",
    "rectification can be seen as follows . from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we may assume that the chance for a particle to get stuck in an aggregate is proportional to its size , and particles have a higher probability to move towards larger obstacles , in the present case , in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "therefore , the rectification we mean here is essentially particles moving from smaller towards larger obstacles .",
    "however , we observe that in the long time limit @xmath83 in all cases studied ( this ocurred even for periodic boundary conditions , since for solid ones this quantity would vanish ) . this can be explained by the fact that swimmers will move in a particular direction as long as there is a larger obstacle ahead in that direction , which can only occur in an infinite , non - periodic lattice .",
    "hence , this rectification effect is a transient phenomenon in a finite lattice .",
    "nevertheless , the steady state of this system , although it has a vanishing particle current , displays a non - uniform density profile along @xmath64-direction , because when particles reach the boundary of the system ( either periodic or solid ) , in which there are no more larger obstacle for them to reach , they do not return to the smaller ones , precisely by the reason we pointed out above , they have a higher probability to get stuck in higher aggregates , in other words , around larger obstacles .    from these considerations",
    ", we studied the density profiles as functions of the same quantities as before ( noise intensity , @xmath15 , unit cell length , @xmath5 , and obstacle size , @xmath6 , and periodic boundaries ) and observed that more particles aggregate around larger obstacles ( which can be interpreted as stronger particle separation , similarly to what was seen in @xcite ) for smaller noise intensity , and denser lattices .",
    "we also observed that , for large noise values , @xmath84 , the density profile is inverted , and swimmers tend to move towards the smaller obstacles , while producing hardly any aggregation around any obstacle .",
    "we interpret this result on account of the need for the particles , when moving under such large noise values , to have a more free space to move ( since they change their motion direction strongly in only a few moves ) , in comparison to the situation seen at low noise values , therefore accumulating , preferentially , in the region where there are the smallest obstacles ( but not around the obstacles themselves , as seen in fig 1(a ) ) .",
    "we reported numerical results on the behavior of self - propelled particles in regular arrays of convex obstacles : either half - circle or circles .",
    "we showed that such an environment provides a means to rectify the swimmer motion .",
    "in the half - circle lattice , this rectification yields a finite drift velocity in the direction of the normal to the flat side of the obstacle , and homogenous spatial density .",
    "the drift velocity depends on density ( area fraction ) , noise magnitude @xmath15 ( low @xmath15 yields high speeds , and vice - versa ) , and density of the obstacles ( larger rectification is found for denser lattices ) .",
    "we also showed that it is possible to control the direction of rectification ( steady velocity ) simply by adjusting the orientation of the half - circles obstacles . in the lattice of circular obstacles",
    ", rectification appeared when a size gradient in the diameter of the obstacle was considered .",
    "it is a transient effect which produces a migration of spp towards larger obstacles , resulting , in the long - time limit , in a vanishing drift velocity , and a non - homogenous particle density .",
    "we found that the swimmers move towards the denser part of the lattice ( larger obstacles ) for low noise , while this tendency is reversed for high noise .",
    "we expect that our results open the way for new rectification ( or separation ) devices of active matter based on simple and symmetric lattices of convex obstacles .",
