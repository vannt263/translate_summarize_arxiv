    "<S> the conventional josephson effect may be modified by introducing spin - active scattering in the interface - layer of the junction . here </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss a josephson junction consisting of two s - wave superconducting leads coupled over a classical spin that precesses with the larmor frequency due to an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetically active interface results in a time - dependent boundary condition with different tunnelling amplitudes for spin - up and -down quasiparticles and where the precession produces spin - flip scattering processes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the andreev states develop sidebands and a non - equilibrium population that depend on the details of the spin precession . </S>",
    "<S> the andreev states carry a steady - state josephson charge current and a time - dependent spin current , whose current - phase relations could be used for characterising the precessing spin . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current is supported by spin - triplet correlations induced by the spin precession and creates a feed - back effect on the classical spin in the form of a torque that shifts the precession frequency .    by applying a bias voltage </S>",
    "<S> , the josephson frequency adds another complexity to the situation and may create resonances together with the larmor frequency . </S>",
    "<S> these shapiro resonances are manifested as torques and are , under suitable conditions , able to reverse the direction of the classical spin in sub - nanosecond time . </S>",
    "<S> another characteristic feature is the subharmonic gap structure in the dc charge current displaying an even - odd effect that is attributable to precession - assisted multiple andreev reflections . </S>"
