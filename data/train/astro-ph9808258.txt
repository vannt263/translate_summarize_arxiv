    "investigations of interstellar molecular hydrogen only are possible in the near ir in emssion and in the far uv in absorption .",
    "the _ copernicus _ has been the first satellite which was able to resolve uv absorption lines from galactic h@xmath0  in the range of 900 to 1200  , and most of our knowledge about the physics of interstellar h@xmath0  is based on studies with this instrument ( spitzer et  al .",
    "in contrast to observations in the near ir , fuv spectroscopy offers the possibility to investigate also the cool component of the gas in which the h@xmath0  molecule likely is the dominant constituent .",
    "more than twenty years after the first results of the _ copernicus _ , the _ orfeus _  fuv telescope allows the measurement of h@xmath0  in all rotational states , not only in our own galaxy , but also in the interstellar matter of the two magellanic clouds .",
    "this is of great importance because of the lower metal content and different gas to dust ratio in the magellanic clouds ( see koornneef 1984 ) .",

    "1m - telescope was launched for its second mission in nov./dec .",

    "the echelle spectrograph operates between 912 and 1410   with a spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",

    "only one smc target has been observed with the echelle during the _ orfeus ii _ mission of nov./dec .",
    "1996 : hd5980 .",
    "it is the brightest stellar object in the smc , variable , and known for further extraordinary properties , as shown by moffat et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with its brightness and high temperature , as well as due to its relatively low extinction of @xmath8 ( fitzpatrick & savage 1983 , hereafter fs83 )",
    ", hd5980 provides us with a large uv flux and therefore is a good background source for the investigation of the smc foregroud gas along this line of sight .",
    "hd5980 was also observed by _ hut _ ( schulte - ladbeck et  al .",
    "1995 ) but with a spectral resolution insufficient to resolve h@xmath0 .",
    "the _ iue _ spectrum of hd5980 shows the main smc absorption in radial velocity near + 140 kms@xmath1   and one additional component at + 300 kms@xmath1  ( fs83 ) .",
    "the _ orfeus _",
    "spectrum , obtained when @xmath9 mag , shows both these components , in particular also in ovi ( widmann et  al .",
    "mcgee & newton ( 1986 ) showed the existence of neutral hydrogen in 21-cm emission at + 123 kms@xmath1  and at + 163 kms@xmath1 .",
    "we therefore expected to see h@xmath0  belonging to the neutral smc gas near those velocities , although due to the low extinction towards hd5980 the h@xmath0  absorption might be too weak and below our detection limit .",
    "as shown by its near - ir emission , h@xmath0  exists in the smc ( koornneef & israel 1985 ) as well as in the lmc ( israel & koornneef 1991a , 1991b ) . the present paper , together with the detection of h@xmath0  absorption profiles in the lmc ( deboer et  al .",
    "1998 ) , presents the first studies of interstellar h@xmath0  in the magellanic clouds via high resolution fuv spectroscopy .",
    "hd5980 has been observed on 1 + 2 dec . with a total observing time of 4800s .",
    "after the main data reduction ( see barnstedt et  al .",
    "1998 for details ) the individual echelle orders have been filtered by a wavelet algorithm ( fligge & solanki 1997 ) .",
    "our spectrum shows a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath10 for wavelengths @xmath5 1000  ; in the range @xmath11 1000   the lower sensitivity leads to a much poorer s / n . the range below 1000 is difficult to analyse , because the density of h@xmath0  absorption lines is very high in that range .",
    "nearly all h@xmath0",
    "lines are blended by other transitions and atomic lines and their components . in the spectral range between 1000 and 1130   we found 17 reasonably clean h@xmath0  absorption lines with absorption at smc velocities .",
    "a portion of the spectrum of hd5980 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "some of the identified h@xmath0  lines are plotted in the velocity scale ( lsr ) in fig.2 .",
    "we detect absorption features from the lowest 8 rotational states .",
    "our detection limit is @xmath12 m . inspecting fig.2 it is immediately clear that the h@xmath0  lines of the low @xmath13 levels have absorption near + 120 kms@xmath1  and those of high @xmath13 levels near + 160 kms@xmath1 .",

    "a detailed analysis of the atomic lines in _ iue _ spectra is given by fs83 .",
    "for the further analysis of the h@xmath0  absorption we call the smc component at + 120 kms@xmath1  _ cloud a _ and the one at + 160 kms@xmath1  _ cloud b_.    for @xmath19 only _ cloud a _ shows strong h@xmath0  lines ; a contribution by _ cloud b _ might be present very weakly , but its absorption lies in the wings of the _ cloud a _ and therefore is not visible . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 the _ cloud b _ absorption becomes stronger and overlaps with the _ cloud a _ component , so that with our spectral resolution of @xmath3 30 kms@xmath1  the h@xmath0  lines from both components combine to one single wider absorption feature . at this stage of data analysis",
    "we do not attempt to separate the two clouds from each other in these intermediate @xmath13 level lines .    to derive h@xmath0  column densities for the smc gas we have to construct curves of growth for each cloud individually .",
    "for that we use the @xmath22-values from morton & dinerstein ( 1976 ) .    for",
    "_ cloud a _ we fitted 8 h@xmath0  lines of @xmath19 to a curve of growth with a velocity dispersion of @xmath23 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the total column density for @xmath2 is @xmath24(h@xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "in _ cloud b _ at + 160 kms@xmath1  we find h@xmath0  absorption for the higher states @xmath27 only .",
    "the existence of absorption from such high states indicates that the gas in _ cloud b _ is highly excited .",
    "the best fit for levels @xmath27 is given by a curve of growth with @xmath28 kms@xmath1 .",
    "both fits to the curve of growth are shown in fig .",
    "3 , the obtained column densities can be found in table 1 .    for _ cloud b",
    "_ we estimate the total amount of h@xmath0by extrapolating the observed amount in the excited levels based on the equivalent excitation temperature ( see section 4 ) .",
    "we so find @xmath29(h@xmath30 @xmath26 .",
    "the 21-cm emission of the neutral hydrogen shows a strong component at + 160 kms@xmath1  ( mcgee & newton 1986 ) .",
    "collisional excitation as well as the uv pumping are the processes responsible for the population of the molecules excited states ( spitzer & zweibel 1974 ) .",
    "a measure for the kinetic state of the the gas is the equivalent excitation temperature , which can be obained by fitting the given population density by a boltzmann distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . the column densities @xmath31 for both smc clouds , devided by their statistical weigth @xmath32 , are plotted against the excitation energy @xmath33 .    for _",
    "cloud a _ we derive an equivalent excitation temperature of @xmath3 70 k. that means that the 3 lowest roational states of _ cloud a _ are most likely collisionally excited , so that the derived temperature reflects the kinetic state of that gas .",
    "the situation looks different for _ cloud b _",
    ", where the fit for @xmath4 leads to an equivalent excitation temperature of @xmath3 2350 k. this temperature is not the kinetic temperature of the gas , but gives the population of the excitation states due to very strong uv pumping , likely caused by the high uv photon flux environment of the smc gas at + 160 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the excitation temperature for _ cloud a _ is similar to values found in many studies of h@xmath0  gas in the milky way ( spitzer et al .",
    "if we assume a galactic foreground reddening of @xmath34 ( mcnamara & feltz 1980 ) , the reddening in the smc gas is @xmath35 for this line of sight .",
    "the fact that we find absorption by h@xmath0  in the smc gas toward a star with that low extinction underlines that the gas - to - dust ratio in the interstellar gas in the smc is significantly higher than the galactic value ( fs83 ) .",
    "neutral hydrogen has been detected in 21-cm emission towards hd5980 at + 123 kms@xmath1  with a column density @xmath36hi ) @xmath37 @xmath26 ( mcgee & newton 1986 ) .",
    "since this velocity is the same as that of _ cloud a _ and since _ cloud a _ shows little uv pumping , it lies likely well in front of hd 5980 .",
    "we thus can compare @xmath38(h@xmath0 ) andb @xmath38(hi ) and derive @xmath39h@xmath0@xmath40hi)@xmath41h@xmath0@xmath42= 6.6 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] as the fraction of hydrogen nuclei in molecular form in the interstellar gas of this cloud . in view of the column density of @xmath38(hi ) at this velocity we place this cloud in the foreground of the smc .",
    "the equivalent excitation temperature of @xmath3 2350 k for _ cloud b _ is the highest one ever seen in studies of h@xmath0  absorption and indicates a strong uv radiation field in gas in the direct environment of _ cloud b _ , probably from the target hd5980 itself .",
    "however , given the high excitation state and the large @xmath38(hi ) from 21 cm at the same velocity , we suggest that the main hi emission comes from gas _ behind _ hd5980 ( see also fs83 ) .",
    "hd 5980 is the visually brightest hot luminous stellar member of the association ngc346 , exciting the large hii  region n66 .",
    "the star was in the late 1980s of wne+ob type with anomalously bright emission lines ( conti et  al .",
    "hd 5980 is an eclipsing binary with a period of 19.3 days , composed of a wn star and an o star with interacting stellar winds .",
    "the star brightened slowly as of that time and the spectrum changed since then ( see moffat et  al .",
    "1998 for the details ) . during the orfeus measurements the star was of spectral type wn7 .",
    "as shown in the _ iue _ spectrum of hd5980 , absorption by civ and siiv occurs at velocities near + 150 kms@xmath1 .",
    "fs83 conclude that the bulk of this highly ionized gas is formed by stellar photoionization of hd5980 . since we detect h@xmath0  near + 160 kms@xmath1  in _ cloud b _ it is reasonable to believe that the molecular gas belongs to the component found by fs83 .",
    "the h@xmath0  of _ cloud b _ is highly influenced by the large uv flux of hd5980 and of ngc346 as a whole , and thus likely resides in the immediate surrounding of the star and the cluster .",
    "the _ orfeus _ fuv spectrum of hd5980 shows absorption by interstellar h@xmath0  in the smc .",
    "two velocity components have been detected belonging to the smc gas .",
    "h@xmath0  gas at + 120 kms@xmath1  is predominantly collisionally excited , as indicated by the lowest three rotational states .",
    "it is similar to galactic h@xmath0 gas .",
    "h@xmath0  gas seen at + 160 kms@xmath1  is highly excited , probably due to uv pumping by the abundant uv photons from hd5980 and ngc346 .",
    "these findings represent , together with the _ orfeus _ detection of h@xmath0  in the lmc ( deboer et  al .",
    "1998 ) , the first studies of h@xmath0  in absorption in the magellanic clouds .",
    "orfeus could only be realized with the support of all our german and american colleagues and collaborators .",
