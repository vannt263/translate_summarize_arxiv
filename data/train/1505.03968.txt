    "over the last decades a huge amount of research work has been devoted on the subject of escaping particles from open dynamical systems . especially the issue of escape in hamiltonian systems",
    "is a classical problem in nonlinear dynamics ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite ",
    "@xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "it is well known , that several types of hamiltonian systems have a finite energy of escape . for values of energy",
    "lower than the escape energy the equipotential surfaces of the systems are close which means that orbits are bound and therefore escape is impossible",
    ". for energy levels above the escape energy on the other hand , the equipotential surfaces open and exit channels emerge through which the particles can escape to infinity .",
    "the literature is replete with studies of such  open \" hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) . at this point",
    "we should emphasize , that all the above - mentioned references on escapes in hamiltonian system are exemplary rather than exhaustive , taking into account that a vast quantity of related literature exists .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of escaping orbits in hamiltonian systems is by far less explored than the closely related problem of chaotic scattering . in this situation , a test particle coming from infinity approaches and then scatters off a complex potential .",
    "this phenomenon is well investigated as well interpreted from the viewpoint of chaos theory ( e.g. , [ @xcite  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ",
    "@xcite , @xcite ",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  @xcite ] ) .",
    "chaotic scattering has also been applied in the astrophysical context of many aspects such as scattering off black holes ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite ] ) and three - body stellar systems ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) . the related invariant manifolds of the chaotic saddle is directly associated with the chaotic dynamical behavior ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) . in particular , the chaotic saddle is defined as the intersection of its stable and unstable manifolds [ @xcite ] , while hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic chaotic saddles may occur in dynamical systems ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "more details on the issue of chaotic scattering and escape from chaotic systems can be found to the recent reviews [ @xcite ] and [ @xcite ] , respectively .    in open hamiltonian systems",
    "an issue of paramount importance is the determination of the basins of escape , similar to basins of attraction in dissipative systems or even the newton - raphson fractal structures .",
    "an escape basin is defined as a local set of initial conditions of orbits for which the test particles escape through a certain exit in the equipotential surface for energies above the escape value .",
    "basins of escape have been studied in many earlier papers ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "the reader can find more details regarding basins of escape in [ @xcite ] , while the review [ @xcite ] provides information about the escape properties of orbits in a multi - channel dynamical system of a two - dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator .",
    "the boundaries of an escape basins may be fractal ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite ] ) or even respect the more restrictive wada property ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) , in the case where three or more escape channels coexist in the equipotential surface .",
    "one of the most characteristic hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom with escape channels is undoubtedly the well - known hnon - heiles system [ @xcite ] .",
    "a huge load of research on the escape properties of this system has been conducted over the years ( e.g. , [ @xcite  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "escaping orbits in the classical restricted - three - body - problem ( rtbp ) is another typical example ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "furthermore , escaping and trapped motion of stars in stellar systems is an another issue of great importance . in a recent article [ @xcite ]",
    ", we explored the nature of orbits of stars in a galactic - type potential , which can be considered to describe local motion in the meridional @xmath4 plane near the central parts of an axially symmetric galaxy .",
    "it was observed , that apart from the trapped orbits there are two types of escaping orbits , those which escape fast and those which need to spend vast time intervals inside the equipotential surface before they find the exit and eventually escape .",
    "furthermore , the chaotic dynamics within a star cluster embedded in the tidal field of a galaxy was explored in [ @xcite ] . in particular , by scanning thoroughly the phase space and obtaining the basins of escape with the respective escape times it was revealed , that the higher escape times correspond to initial conditions of orbits near the fractal basin boundaries .",
    "the aim of this work is to numerically investigate the escape dynamics in a seyfert galaxy with a rotating active central nucleus .",
    "the recent paper of ernst & peters ( 2014 ) [ @xcite ] is used as a guide since we follow the same numerical methods and computational approach .",
    "the present paper however , contains several new aspects with respect to [ @xcite ] that can be considered as further developments in the field of open galactic systems . in particular : ( i ) we proceed one step further by using the sali method in order to distinguish between regular and chaotic trapped motion , ( ii ) we display the evolution of the percentages of all types of orbits in both the physical and phase space as a function of the value of the energy integral , ( iii ) we conduct an overview analysis thus revealing how the orbital structure of the dynamical system is influenced by the total energy when we use a continuous spectrum of energy values rather than some few discrete levels and ( iv ) we relate the escape times of orbits with the energy as well as with the width of the symmetrical escape channels .    the article is organized as follows : in section [ mod ] we present in detail the structure and the properties of our seyfert galaxy model .",
    "all the computational methods we used in order to determine the character of orbits are described in section [ cometh ] . in the following section , we conduct a thorough numerical investigation revealing the overall orbital structure ( bounded regions and basins of escape ) of the galaxy and how it is affected by the total orbital energy . in section [ spr ]",
    "we show that our dynamical model can simulate , in away , the creation as well as the evolution of spiral arms of a real seyfert galaxy .",
    "our paper ends with section [ disc ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this research are given .",
    "for the description of the seyfert galaxy we use the following mass - model potential @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the total mass of the galaxy , @xmath8 is a parameter leading to deviation from axial and spherical symmetry , while @xmath9 is the scale length of the galaxy which acts also as a softening parameter .",
    "the generalized anharmonic plummer potential ( [ pot ] ) has been successfully applied several times in the past in order to realistically model non axially symmetric galaxies ( see e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) . at this point",
    "we would like to stress out that the single - component potential of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) models the properties of the seyfert galaxy as a whole rather than an isolate component ( e.g. , the galactic bar ) .",
    "we consider the case where the dense and compact active nucleus of the seyfert galaxy rotates clockwise at a constant angular velocity @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the effective potential is given by @xmath11 which is in fact a cut through the equatorial plane of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) potential .    in our study",
    ", we use a system of galactic units , where the unit of length is 1 kpc , the unit of mass is @xmath12 and the unit of time is @xmath13 yr ( approximately 100 myr ) .",
    "the velocity unit is 10 km / s , while @xmath6 is equal to unity @xmath14 .",
    "the energy unit ( per unit mass ) is 100 km@xmath15s@xmath16 . in these units ,",
    "the values of the involved parameters are : @xmath17 ( corresponding to 1.1625 @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and they remain constant throughout the numerical analysis . the values of @xmath7 and @xmath9 were chosen having in mind the seyfert galaxy ngc 1566 ( see at the end of section [ spr ] for more details ) .",
    "this galactic model has five equilibria called lagrangian points [ @xcite ] at which @xmath23 the isolines contours of constant effective potential as well as the position of the five lagrangian points @xmath24 are shown in fig .",
    "[ conts]a .",
    "three of them , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath25 , known as the collinear points , are located in the @xmath26-axis .",
    "the central stationary point @xmath25 at @xmath27 is a local minimum of @xmath28 . at the other four lagrangian points it is possible for the test particle to move in a circular orbit , while appearing to be stationary in the rotating frame . for this circular orbit ,",
    "the centrifugal and the gravitational forces precisely balance .",
    "the stationary points @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath29 are saddle points , where @xmath30 is called lagrangian radius .",
    "let @xmath0 located at @xmath31 , while @xmath1 be at @xmath32 .",
    "the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the other hand , which are located at @xmath35 are local maxima of the effective potential , enclosed by the banana - shaped isolines .",
    "the annulus bounded by the circles through @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is known as the  region of coroation \" ( see also [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion in the rotating frame are described in vectorial form by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the position vector , @xmath38 is the constant rotation velocity vector around the vertical @xmath39-axis , while the term @xmath40 represents the coriolis force .",
    "decomposing eq .",
    "( [ eqmot0 ] ) into rectangular cartesian coordinates @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath41 where the dot indicates derivative with respect to the time .    in the same vein ,",
    "the equations describing the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath42 which joins the corresponding phase space points of two initially nearby orbits , needed for the calculation of standard chaos indicators ( the sali in our case ) are given by the following variational equations @xmath43    consequently , the corresponding hamiltonian ( known also as the jacobian ) to the effective potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the momenta per unit mass , conjugate to @xmath26 and @xmath47 , respectively , while @xmath48 is the numerical value of the jacobian , which is conserved since it is an isolating integral of motion .",
    "thus , an orbit with a given value for it s energy integral is restricted in its motion to regions in which @xmath49 , while all other regions are forbidden to the star .",
    "the numerical value of the effective potential at the two lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that is @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively yields to a critical jacobi constant @xmath52 , which can be used to define a dimensionless energy parameter as @xmath53 where @xmath48 is some other value of the jacobian . the dimensionless energy parameter @xmath54 makes the reference to energy levels more convenient . for @xmath55 the equipotential surface encloses the critical area and @xmath1 encloses a critical volume . ] , while for a jacobian value @xmath56 , or in other words when @xmath57 , the equipotential surface is open and consequently stars can escape from the galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ conts]b we present the contour of @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "we observe , the two openings ( exit channels ) through which the particles can leak out .",
    "in fact , we may say that these two exits act as hoses connecting the interior region ( green color ) of the galaxy where @xmath60 with the  outside world \" of the exterior region ( amber color ) .",
    "exit channel 1 at the negative @xmath26-direction corresponds to escape through lagrangian point @xmath0 , while exit channel 2 at the positive @xmath26-direction indicates escape through @xmath1 .",
    "the forbidden regions of motion within the banana - shaped isolines around @xmath33 and @xmath34 points are shown in fig .",
    "[ conts]b with gray .",
    "it is evident , that for @xmath61 the two forbidden regions merge together thus escape is impossible since the interior region cannon communicate with the exterior area .",
    "in order to explore the escape dynamics of stars in the seyfert galaxy model , we need to define samples of initial conditions of orbits whose properties ( bounded or escaping motion ) will be identified . the best method for this purpose , would have been to choose the sets of initial conditions of the orbits from a distribution function of the system .",
    "this however , is not available , so we define for each value of the total orbital energy ( all tested energy levels are above the escape energy ) , dense grids of initial conditions regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the energy .",
    "our investigation takes place both in the physical @xmath2 and in the phase @xmath3 space for a better understanding of the escape process . in both cases ,",
    "the step separation of the initial conditions along the axes ( or in other words , the density of the grids ) is controlled in such a way that always there are about @xmath62 orbits ( a maximum grid of 318 @xmath63 318 equally spaced initial conditions of orbits ) , depending on the value of the jacobian integral .",
    "furthermore , the grids of initial conditions of orbits whose properties will be examined are defined as follows : for the physical @xmath2 space we consider orbits with initial conditions @xmath64 with @xmath65 , while the initial value of @xmath66 is always obtained from the energy integral ( [ ham ] ) as @xmath67 . similarly , for the phase @xmath3 space we consider orbits with initial conditions",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath69 , while this time the initial value of @xmath70 is obtained from the jacobi integral ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion as well as the variational equations for the initial conditions of all orbits were integrated using a double precision bulirsch - stoer ` fortran 77 ` algorithm ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) with a small time step of order of @xmath71 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations .",
    "here we should emphasize , that our previous numerical experience suggests that the bulirsch - stoer integrator is both faster and more accurate than a double precision runge - kutta - fehlberg algorithm of order 7 with cash - karp coefficients . throughout all our computations , the jacobian energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath72 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath73 .    in dynamical systems with escapes",
    "an issue of paramount importance is the determination of the position as well as the time at which an orbit escapes .",
    "for all values of energy smaller than the critical value @xmath74 ( escape energy ) , the equipotential surface is closed and therefore all orbits are bounded . on the other hand , when @xmath56 the equipotential surface is open and extend to infinity .",
    "the value of the energy itself however , does not furnish a sufficient condition for escape .",
    "an open equipotential curve consists of two branches forming channels through which an orbit can escape to infinity ( see fig .",
    "[ conts]b ) .",
    "it was proved [ @xcite ] that in hamiltonian systems there is a highly unstable periodic orbit at every opening close to the line of maximum potential which is called a lyapunov orbit .",
    "in fact , there is a family of unstable lyapunov orbits around each collinear lagrangian point [ @xcite ] .",
    "such an orbit reaches the zero velocity curve space where kinetic energy vanishes . ]",
    "( zvc ) , on both sides of the opening and returns along the same path thus , connecting two opposite branches of the zvc .",
    "lyapunov orbits are very important for the escapes from the system , since if an orbit intersects any one of these orbits with velocity pointing outwards moves always outwards and eventually escapes from the system without any further intersections with the surface of section ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] . when @xmath55 the lagrangian points exist precisely but when @xmath56 an unstable lyapunov periodic orbit is located close to each of these two points ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the two unstable lyapunov orbits around @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ conts]b in red .",
    "it eventually escapes from the opposite exit channel , through @xmath1 . ]",
    "these two lagrangian points are saddle points of the effective potential , so when @xmath56 , a star must pass close enough to one of these points in order to escape .",
    "thus , in our galactic system the escape criterion is purely geometric .",
    "in particular , escapers are defined to be those stars moving in orbits beyond the lagrangian radius @xmath75 thus passing one of the two lagrangian points ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) with velocity pointing outwards . here",
    "we must emphasize that orbits with initial conditions outside the interior region , or in other words outside @xmath0 or @xmath1 , does not necessarily escape immediately from the galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ orb12 ] we present a characteristic example of such an orbit with initial conditions : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 when @xmath59 .",
    "we observe that even though this orbit is initiated outside but very close to @xmath0 it does not escape right away from the system . on the other hand , it enters the interior galactic region and only after 32 time units of chaotic motion it eventually escapes from the opposite channel .",
    "thus it is evident , that the initial position itself does not furnish a sufficient condition for escape , since the escape criterion is a combination of the coordinates and the velocity of stars .",
    "the physical and the phase space are divided into the escaping and non - escaping ( trapped ) space .",
    "usually , the vast majority of the trapped space is occupied by initial conditions of regular orbits forming stability islands where a third integral is present . in many systems",
    "however , trapped chaotic orbits have also been observed .",
    "therefore , we decided to distinguish between regular and chaotic trapped motion . over the years",
    ", several chaos indicators have been developed in order to determine the character of orbits . in our case , we chose to use the smaller alingment index ( sali ) method .",
    "the sali [ @xcite ] has been proved a very fast , reliable and effective tool , which is defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the alignments indices , while @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are two deviation vectors which initially point in two random directions . for distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion , all we have to do is to compute the sali along time interval @xmath84 of numerical integration . in particular , we track simultaneously the time - evolution of the main orbit itself as well as the two deviation vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 in order to compute the sali .",
    "the time - evolution of sali strongly depends on the nature of the computed orbit since when an orbit is regular the sali exhibits small fluctuations around non zero values , while on the other hand , in the case of chaotic orbits the sali after a small transient period it tends exponentially to zero approaching the limit of the accuracy of the computer @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the particular time - evolution of the sali allow us to distinguish fast and safely between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "nevertheless , we have to define a specific numerical threshold value for determining the transition from order to chaos . after conducting extensive numerical experiments , integrating many sets of orbits ,",
    "we conclude that a safe threshold value for the sali is the value @xmath86 .",
    "thus , in order to decide whether an orbit is regular or chaotic , one may follow the usual method according to which we check after a certain and predefined time interval of numerical integration , if the value of sali has become less than the established threshold value . therefore , if sali @xmath87 the orbit is chaotic , while if sali @xmath88 the orbit is regular thus making the distinction between regular and chaotic motion clear and beyond any doubt . for the computation of sali we used the ` lp - vi ` code [ @xcite ] , a fully operational routine which efficiently computes a suite of many chaos indicators for dynamical systems in any number of dimensions .    in our computations ,",
    "we set @xmath89 time units as a maximum time of numerical integration .",
    "the vast majority of orbits ( regular and chaotic ) however , need considerable less time to find one of the two exits in the limiting curve and eventually escape from the system ( obviously , the numerical integration is effectively ended when an orbit passes through one of the escape channels and escapes ) .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to use such a vast integration time just to be sure that all orbits have enough time in order to escape .",
    "remember , that there are the so called  sticky orbits \" which behave as regular ones during long periods of time .",
    "here we should clarify , that orbits which do not escape after a numerical integration of @xmath89 time units ( @xmath90 yr ) are considered as non - escaping or trapped .",
    "in fact , orbits with escape periods equal to many hubble times are completely irrelevant to our investigation since they lack physical meaning .",
    ".type , initial conditions , value of the energy and integration time of the orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ orbs](a - d ) .",
    "when the initial value of @xmath45 or @xmath46 is indicated as @xmath91 it means that is obtained from the jacobi integral ( [ ham ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to obtain a more complete view on how the total orbital energy influences the nature of orbits in our galaxy model , we follow a similar numerical approach to that explained before but now all orbits of stars are initiated from the vertical @xmath47-axis with @xmath92 . in particular , this time we use the section @xmath93 , @xmath94 , launching orbits parallel to the @xmath26-axis .",
    "this allow us to construct again a 2d plane in which the @xmath47 coordinate of orbits is the abscissa , while the logarithmic value of the energy @xmath95 is the ordinate .",
    "the orbital structure of the @xmath96-plane when @xmath97 $ ] is shown in fig .",
    "the vertical , dashed , magenta lines indicate the position of the lagrangian points @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the black solid line is the limiting curve which distinguishes between regions of allowed and forbidden motion and is defined as @xmath98 a very complicated orbital structure is reveled in the @xmath96-plane which however , in general terms , is very similar with that of the @xmath99-plane .",
    "one may observe that for @xmath100 the forbidden regions of motion around @xmath33 and @xmath34 completely disappear .",
    "in fact the value @xmath101 is another critical energy level .",
    "it is seen that above that critical value the left part @xmath102 of the plane is occupied almost completely with initial conditions of orbits that escape through @xmath1 , while the right part of the same plane on the other hand , contains mostly initial conditions of non - escaping regular orbits .",
    "it is evident from the results presented in figs .",
    "[ xyc](c - d ) that the escape times of the orbits are strongly correlated to the escape basins . in addition , one may conclude that the smallest escape periods correspond to orbits with initial conditions inside the escape basins , while orbits initiated in the fractal regions of the planes or near the boundaries of stability islands have the highest escape rates . in both types of planes the escape times of orbits are significantly reduced with increasing energy . combining all the numerical outcomes presented in figs . [ xyc](a - d ) we may say that the key factor that determines and controls the escape times of the orbits is the value of the orbital energy ( the higher the energy level the shorter the escape rates ) , while the fractality of the basin boundaries varies strongly both as a function of the energy and of the spatial variable .    the evolution of the average value of the escape time @xmath103 of orbits as a function of the dimensionless energy parameter is given in fig .",
    "[ wtesc]a .",
    "it is seen , that for low values of energy the average escape time of orbits reduces rapidly , while for @xmath104 , it seems to saturate around 80 time units .",
    "we feel it is important to justify this behaviour of the escape time .",
    "as previously explained , a lyapunov orbit acts like a barrier , reaches the zvc on both sides of the opening and returns along the same path thus , connecting two opposite branches of the zvc .",
    "therefore , we could exploit this fact in order to quantify the escape process . for this purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath105 as the distance between the two points at which the lyapunov orbit touches the two opposite branches of the zvc . using @xmath105 we can measure , in a way , the width of the escape channels .",
    "[ wtesc]b depicts the evolution of @xmath105 as a function of the energy parameter @xmath54 .",
    "we observe an almost exponential growth of @xmath105 with increasing energy .",
    "this means that as the value of the jacobi constant increases the escape channels ( which are of course symmetrical ) become more and more wide and therefore , orbits need less and less time in order to find one of the two openings in the open equipotential surface and eventually escape from the system .",
    "this geometrical feature explains why for low values of energy orbits consume large time periods wandering inside the open equipotential surface until they eventually locate one of the two exits and escape to infinity .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that it is the geometrical shape of the exit channels that justifies the decreasing pattern of @xmath106 shown in fig .",

    "it is well known that when stars escape from star clusters through the lagrangian points form complicated structures known as tidal tails or tidal arms ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) . in the same vein , in the case of barred spiral galaxies we observe the formation of spiral arms ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) . usually a star cluster rotates around its parent galaxy in a circular orbit thus , the tidal tails follow the curvature defined by the circular orbit and they are nearly straights for orbits moving in large galactocentric distances ( see e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the spiral arms of barred galaxies on the other hand , are formed by the non - axisymmetric perturbation of the bar . in particular , in barred spiral galaxies with prominent spiral - like shape the two arms start from the ends of the bar and then they wind up around the banana - shaped forbidden regions which enclose the lagrangian points @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "almost all seyfert galaxies are spiral galaxies and have been among the most intensively studied objects in astronomy ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "therefore , it would be very challenging to investigate if our simple gravitational model has the ability to realistically simulate the formation of spiral arms .",
    "as a first step , we integrated the two orbits shown in fig .",

    "it is seen , that both orbits follow indeed a spiral path around the yellow banana - shaped isolines of the effective potential in which the lagrangian points @xmath33 and @xmath34 are enclosed .",
    "taking into account that our initial tests are positive regarding the formation of the spiral structure , we reconfigured our integration routine for the computation of the basins of escape to yield output of all orbit trajectories for a three - dimensional grid of size @xmath107 for @xmath59 .",
    "this dense grid of initial conditions is centered at the origin of the phase space and we allow for all orbits both sings of @xmath46 . our purpose is to monitor the time - evolution of the path of the orbits and simulate the spiral arm formation . at @xmath108",

    "we have the first indication of the formation of spiral arms , where with green and red color we depict stars that escaped through exit channels 1 and 2 , respectively , while stars that remain inside the lagrangian radius are shown in gray .",
    "as time goes by we see that the two symmetrical spiral arms grow in size and at @xmath112 time units ( 500 myr ) the seyfert galaxy has obtained its complete spiral structure , while the interior galactic region is uniformly filled . at this point",
    "we have to point out that the standard integration code , which was used to obtain the results presented in figs . [ grd1 ] and [ grd2 ] , plots a point at every step of the numerical integration . in fig .",
    "[ sps](a - d ) on the other hand , the density of points along one star orbit is taken to be proportional to the velocity of the star .",
    "being more specific , a point is plotted ( showing the position of a star ) , if an integer counter variable which is increased by one at every integration step , exceeds the velocity of the star .",
    "following this technique we can simulate , in a way , a real @xmath113-body simulation of the spiral evolution of the galaxy , where the density of stars will be highest where the corresponding velocity is lowest . therefore , we proved that for @xmath59 the scenario of evolution of spiral arms in our galaxy model is indeed viable .",
    "additional numerical simulations reveal that this is also true for other ( lower or higher ) values of energy .",

    "it is also the brightest and most dominant member of the dorado group , a loose concentration of galaxies located approximately 40 million light - years away that together comprise one of the richest galaxy groups of the southern hemisphere .",
    "ngc 1566 is an intermediate spiral galaxy of type sab(rs)bc , meaning that while it does not have a well defined bar - shaped region of stars at its central region - like normal barred spirals - it is not quite an unbarred spiral either .",
    "the small but extremely bright nucleus of ngc 1566 is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ ngc ] [ @xcite ] , a telltale sign of its membership of the seyfert class of galaxies .",
    "the centres of such galaxies are very active and luminous , emitting strong bursts of radiation and potentially harbouring super - massive black holes that are many millions of times the mass of the sun .",
    "this image highlights the beauty and awe - inspiring nature of this unique galaxy group , with ngc 1566 glittering and glowing , its bright nucleus framed by swirling and symmetrical lavender arms . in fig .",
    "[ ngc ] we have superposed the time snapshot at @xmath112 time units ( 500 myr ) of our simulation above the real image of the galaxy .",
    "we observe that the central interior region adequately matches the active galactic core , while the two spiral arms obtained from the numerical simulation fit the corresponding real ones .",
    "thus , we may conclude that our simple one - component gravitational effective potential ( [ eff ] ) can , in a way , model not only the escape dynamics but also the spiral formation and evolution of seyfert galaxies .    undoubtedly , a seyfert galaxy is a very complex stellar entity and therefore",
    ", we need to assume some necessary simplifications and assumptions in order to be able to study mathematically the orbital behavior of such a complicated stellar system . for this purpose ,",
    "our gravitational model is intentionally simple and contrived , in order to give us the ability to study all the different aspects regarding the kinematics and dynamics of the system .",
    "nevertheless , contrived models can surely provide an insight into more realistic stellar systems , which unfortunately are very difficult to be explored , if we take into account all the astrophysical aspects ( i.e. , gas , mergers , close encounters etc ) .",
    "self - consistent models on the other hand , are mainly used when conducting @xmath113-body simulations . however , this application is entirely out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "once more , we have to point out that the simplicity of our model is necessary , otherwise it would be extremely difficult , or even impossible , to apply the extensive and detailed numerical calculations presented in this study .",
    "our single - component potential neglect many features which must exist in real seyfert galaxies such as colors / ages of stars populations , deviations from simple symmetries and time - independent perturbations .",
    "however , it is still significant that the conclusions derived from this simple potential all agree , both qualitatively and semi - quantitatively .",
    "this suggests that our model is robust , depending only on such topological properties of the phase space .",
    "the aim of this work was to shed some light to the trapped or escaping nature of orbits in a dynamical gravitational model describing a seyfert galaxy . in order to describe the properties of the seyfert galaxy as a whole we used an asymmetric plummer - type potential .",
    "at this point we should emphasize that a seyfert galaxy is composed of a disk , bulge a central nucleus and a bar .",
    "however , our dynamical system has two degrees of freedom and for this type of hamiltonians we usually adopt single component potentials to model the properties of barred galaxies ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) or galaxies in general ( e.g. , [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] ) .",
    "this approach allow us to directly determine the effects of the single component potential to the the different types ( resonances ) of orbits , the amount of chaos , the escape properties and other dynamical aspects .",
    "the jacobi integral of motion has a critical threshold value ( or escape energy ) which determines if the escape process is possible or not .",
    "in particular , for energies smaller than the threshold value , the equipotential surface is closed and it is certainly true that escape is impossible . for energy levels larger than the escape energy however , the equipotential surface opens and two exit channels appear through which the particles can escape to infinity . here",
    "it should be emphasized , that if a test particle does has energy larger than the escape value , there is no guarantee that the star will certainly escape from the system and even if escape does occur , the time required for an orbit to transit through an exit and hence escape to infinity may be vary long compared with the natural escaping time .",
    "we managed to distinguish between ordered / chaotic and trapped / escaping orbits and we also located the basins of escape leading to different exit channels , finding correlations with the corresponding escape times of the orbits .",
    "our extensive and thorough numerical investigation strongly suggests , that the overall escape mechanism is a very complicated procedure and very dependent on the value of the jacobi integral .",
    "since a distribution function of the model was not available so as to use it for extracting the different samples of orbits , we had to follow an alternative path .",
    "we defined for several values of the jacobi integral , dense grids of initial conditions @xmath114 and @xmath68 regularly distributed in the area allowed by the energy level on the physical and phase space , respectively and then we identified regions of order / chaos and bound / escape . in each type of grid the step separation of the initial conditions along the axes ( or in other words the density of the grid ) was controlled in such a way that there are always at least @xmath62 orbits to be integrated and classified . for the numerical integration of the orbits in each type of grid , we needed about between 1 hour and 5 days of cpu time on a pentium dual - core 2.2 ghz pc , depending on the escape rates of orbits in each case . for each initial condition ,",
    "the maximum time of the numerical integration was set to be equal to @xmath89 time units however , when a particle escaped the numerical integration was effectively ended and proceeded to the next available initial condition .",
    "the present article provides quantitative information regarding the escape dynamics in spiral seyfert galaxies .",
    "the main numerical results of our research can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in",
    "all examined cases , areas of bounded motion and regions of initial conditions leading to escape in a given direction ( basins of escape ) , were found to exist in both the physical and the phase space .",
    "the several escape basins are very intricately interwoven and they appear either as well - defined broad regions or thin elongated bands .",
    "regions of bounded orbits first and foremost correspond to stability islands of regular orbits where a third integral of motion is present .",
    "2 .   a strong correlation between the extent of the basins of escape and the value of the jacobi integral was found to exist .",
    "indeed , for low energy levels the structure of both the physical and the phase space exhibits a large degree of fractalization and therefore the majority of orbits escape choosing randomly exit channels . as the value of the energy increases",
    "however , the structure becomes less and less fractal and several basins of escape emerge .",
    "the extent of these basins of escape is more prominent at high energy levels .",
    "3 .   in both the physical and the phase space we identified a small portion of trapped chaotic orbits which do not escape within the predefined maximum time of numerical integration .",
    "the initial conditions of these orbits are located either in thin chaotic layers ( separatrix ) inside the regular areas of motion , or near the boundaries of stability islands . moreover",
    ", these orbits reveal their chaotic nature very quickly , so they can not be considered as sticky orbits .",
    "we observed , that in many cases the escape process is highly sensitive dependent on the initial conditions , which means that a minor change in the initial conditions of an orbit lead the test particle to escape through the other exit channel .",
    "these regions are the exact opposite of the escape basins , are completely intertwined with respect to each other ( fractal structure ) and are mainly located in the vicinity of stability islands .",
    "this sensitivity towards slight changes in the initial conditions in the fractal regions implies , that it is impossible to predict through which exit the particle will escape .",
    "our calculations revealed , that the escape times of orbits are directly linked to the basins of escape . in particular , inside the basins of escape as well as relatively away from the fractal domains , the shortest escape rates of the orbits had been measured . on the other hand ,",
    "the longest escape periods correspond to initial conditions of orbits either near the boundaries between the escape basins or in the vicinity of the stability islands .",
    "it was detected , that for energy levels slightly above the escape energy the majority of the escaping orbits have considerable long escape rates ( or escape periods ) , while as we proceed to higher energies the proportion of fast escaping orbits increases significantly .",
    "this behavior was justified , by taken into account a geometrical feature of the equipotential surface .",
    "specifically , for low values of energy the width of the exit channels is too small therefore , stellar orbits consume large time periods wandering inside the open equipotential surface until they eventually locate one of the two exits and escape to infinity .",
    "moreover , it was proved that the width of the escape channels grows rapidly with increasing energy , while at the same time the average escape time decreases significantly .",
    "we presented evidence that escaping stars with values of energy higher than the critical jacobi value form spiral arms outside the interior galactic region defined by the lagrangian radius .",
    "this procedure has a striking similarity to the formation of tidal tails in star clusters .",
    "we also conducted numerical simulations proving that our gravitational effective potential can model the formation as well as the evolution of spiral arms in real seyfert galaxies .",
    "judging by the detailed and novel outcomes we may say that our task has been successfully completed . we hope that the present numerical analysis and the corresponding results to be useful in the field of escape dynamics in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the outcomes as well as the conclusions of the present research are considered , as an initial effort and also as a promising step in the task of understanding the escape mechanism of orbits in agns .",
    "taking into account that our results are encouraging , it is in our future plans to modify properly our galactic model in order to expand our investigation into three dimensions and explore the entire six - dimensional phase space .",
    "in addition , @xmath113-body simulations may elaborate the formation as well as the evolution of spiral structure in seyfert galaxies .",
