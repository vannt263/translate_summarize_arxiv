    "electron density ( n@xmath1 ) is a fundamental physical parameter of a plasma , and one of the main ways for determining this quantity in remote astrophysical sources is via emission line intensity ratios which are sensitive to variations in n@xmath1 . in the case of the high temperature solar transition region and corona ,",
    "many of the emission lines lie at extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelengths ( @xmath01001200 ) , and for more than half a century numerous researchers have worked on the calculation of theoretical line ratio n@xmath1-diagnostics involving euv transitions ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such diagnostics have generally been used in conjunction with medium to high spectral resolution solar observations obtained with rocket - borne or satellite - based instrumentation , required to adequately resolve and hence reliably measure the relevant emission lines .",
    "examples include the s082a instrument on board the skylab space station , which had a resolution of @xmath00.1  @xcite , the solar euv rocket telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) at 0.050.08resolution @xcite , the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) satellite at @xmath00.4resolution @xcite and the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on the hinode satellite at @xmath00.07resolution @xcite .",
    "the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , launched on 2010 february 11 , contains a number of instruments including the extreme ultraviolet variability experiment ( eve ) , which obtains a full - disk euv spectrum every 10s using its megs - a component , albeit at a relatively low resolution of @xmath01  @xcite .",
    "although the eve temporal resolution is unprecedented for an euv spectrometer , allowing detailed studies of time - dependent phenomena such as flares , one would expect the spectral resolution to be too low to provide reliable electron density diagnostics .",
    "however , @xcite found that a few fexxi emission line ratios in the 90160  portion of the megs - a flare spectra provide useful electron density diagnostics for values of n@xmath1 in the range @xmath010@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 , hence allowing the study of the temporal evolution of relatively low flare density .",
    "the short - wavelength spectrometer on the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) satellite obtained spectra of astrophysical sources in the 70190  region at a resolution of @xmath00.5  @xcite .",
    "it observed many highly - active late - type stars ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and due to the comparable spectral coverage and resolution with eve flare data , the euve and eve observations can appear remarkably similar in terms of the presence of highly ionised fe lines , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "hence the euve spectra may be employed as a ` testbed ' for fe ion line ratio diagnostics in eve observations , and in particular allow us to assess the potential usefulness of such diagnostics for high n@xmath1 flare plasmas , as active late - type stars can contain high density ( up to @xmath010@xmath6@xmath5 or greater ) coronal material .        in the present paper",
    "we significantly expand upon the work of @xcite to establish if other high temperature ( @xmath710mk ) fe lines apart from those of fexxi can be used to derived plasma densities under flare conditions .",
    "specifically , we undertake a comparison of eve and euve observations , plus published results for well - diagnosed high density tokamak plasmas , to test the validity of additional highly ionized fe line ratios present in eve spectra between 90160  as reasonable density diagnostics for flaring plasmas .",
    "more importantly , we also assess if they can be employed to derive densities in the high n@xmath1 ( @xmath210@xmath410@xmath6@xmath5 ) regime .",
    "the solar observations considered in the present paper consist of eve spectra for two x - class solar flares obtained at event peak , namely that of 2011 february 15 at 01:55:32 ut ( x2.2 class ) and 2011 august 9 at 08:05:07 ut ( x6.9 class ) .",
    "these flares were selected to maximise both the intensities of the highly ionized fe lines of interest ( and hence minimise the effect of blending from low temperature transitions ) , and the electron density of the emitting plasma ( ideally reaching densities close to 10@xmath6@xmath5 ) .",
    "details of the eve instrument and data reduction procedures may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the multiple euv grating spectrograph ( megs)-a of eve obtains full - disk spectra of the sun in the 65370wavelength range , at a resolution of @xmath01.0 , every 10s .",
    "we have employed the most recent release of the eve data ( level 2 , version 5 ) , based on new rocket calibration flights , which improves the accuracy in the irradiance values presented in earlier releases ( @xcite ) .",
    "our paper is focused on the @xmath090160  region of megs - a , which contained numerous emission lines arising from transitions in fexviii  fexxiii .",
    "@xcite have previously undertaken an analysis of fexviii ",
    "fexxiv features in eve spectra , to investigate which of these may be relatively free of blending in solar flares and hence have the potential to be employed as diagnostics .",
    "however , these authors did not consider electron density diagnostics in detail , in particular the consistency of densities derived from different line ratios .",
    "furthermore , they focused on plasmas with n@xmath1 in the range @xmath010@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 , where many of the fe line diagnostics are not particularly useful .",
    "for example , the fexxi ( 142.14 + 142.28)/128.75 ratio recommended by @xcite only varies by @xmath035%  between 10@xmath3 and 10@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the fexxi 145.73/128.75 ratio recommended by both @xcite and @xcite varies by a much greater amount over this density interval ( a factor of 4.8 ) , but with the problem that the 145.73  line is very weak at such values of n@xmath1 , being predicted to be typically only 5%  of the intensity of 128.75 .",
    "by contrast , our work is primarily concerned with the identification and assessment of diagnostics for much higher density flare plasmas , ideally up to n@xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath6@xmath5 or even greater .    in table 1",
    "we summarise the lines judged by @xcite to be blend free and which may provide electron density sensitive intensity ratios .",
    "however , in addition we include the fexxi 123.83 and fexxii 156.02  transitions .",
    "the former was not considered by @xcite , while in the case of fexxii 156.02  these authors noted that the line appeared to be blended as it implied a very high value of electron density . to investigate the potential blending of these features ,",
    "we have calculated synthetic spectra with the latest version ( 8.0.1 ) of the chianti collisional - radiative modelling packages , appropriate for plasmas with densities up to @xmath010@xmath8@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "spectra have been generated for electron densities in the range 10@xmath310@xmath6@xmath5 , and for the standard chianti flare differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution .",
    "although each solar flare will have its own characteristics ( including dem ) , we note that the highly ionized fe lines are formed over a narrow range of temperatures of maximum fractional abundance , log t@xmath9 = 7.07.1 @xcite .",
    "the dems of different flares do not vary significantly over this temperature interval , as shown by for example figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "our chianti synthetic spectra indicate that blending species ( primarily crxvii 122.97 , mnxxi 124.08 and crxx 156.02 ) should make at most @xmath025%   contributions to the total measured line fluxes of both the fexxi 123.83 and fexxii 156.02  lines .",
    ".highly ionized fe lines considered in the present analysis [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath10ratios are in photon units .",
    "+ @xmath11total exposure time of the summed euve short - wavelength spectrum .",
    "+ @xmath12from @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath13from @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath14from @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath15l indicates that the observed ratio is greater than the theoretical low density limit .",
    "+ @xmath16stellar electron densities derived from a range of high temperature ions in the euve spectra .",
    "the tokamak values are those measured by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the final sets of euv spectra considered here are from the frascati tokamak upgrade ( ftu ) and princeton large torus ( plt ) tokamaks , obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "all three datasets have a spectral resolution of @xmath00.7 , similar to those of the eve and euve observations .",
    "the tokamak spectra will not show the same level of blending as the astrophysical data , due to the latter sampling a larger number of elements .",
    "however , they should still provide a useful comparison with the solar / stellar observations , as most of the significant emission lines in the euv region of interest arise from other high ionization fe transitions .",
    "this is shown by , for example , a comparison of the fe spectrum of the ftu tokamak between 85140  in figure 2 of @xcite with the eve and euve data in figure 1 , which appear very similar .",
    "hence the tokamak spectra should allow the reliability and consistency of highly ionized fe line diagnostics to be assessed .",
    "tokamaks are also particularly useful to the present study as their plasmas have very large values of n@xmath1 , similar to or greater than those of high electron density flares .",
    "line fluxes for the fe ion lines in both the eve and euve spectra were determined by fitting multiple gaussian profiles to the observations , with some example fits shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the resultant line intensity ratios ( in photon units ) , along with the @xmath171@xmath18 errors , are listed in table 2 .",
    "also included in the table are the observed line ratios for the ftu and plt tokamak spectra , taken directly from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have derived values of electron density from the observed eve , euve and tokamak line ratios using theoretical results from the latest version ( 8.0.1 ) of chianti @xcite .",
    "all of the line ratio calculations were performed at the value of t@xmath9 of the relevant fe ion @xcite , although we note that the results are not sensitive to the adopted temperature .",
    "for example , changing the electron temperature for the fexxi ( 142.14 + 142.28)/128.75 line ratio calculations from t@xmath9 = 1.1@xmath1910@xmath20k to 2@xmath1910@xmath20k leads to a @xmath210.1 dex variation in the derived value of n@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , for fexxii 114.41/135.79 , adopting t@xmath1 = 2.5@xmath1910@xmath20k rather than t@xmath9 = 1.3@xmath1910@xmath20k also results in a @xmath210.1 dex change in the density estimate .",
    "hence even if the plasma is not in ionization equilibrium and the temperature is significantly different from t@xmath9 , as may be the case during a flare ( see , for example , @xcite ) , this should not affect the derived values of n@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the timescale to achieve ionization equilibrium scales with electron density , and for the high n@xmath1 events considered here the ionization state of fe should be close to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "also listed in table 2 are the electron densities , denoted n@xmath1(other ) , determined from a range of high temperature ions in the euve spectra , in particular those with lines known to be blended in the eve spectra @xcite but which should be relatively unblended in the ( somewhat ) greater resolution euve observations .",
    "these include density diagnostics such as fexx 121.85/110.63 , fexxi 121.21/128.75 and fexxii 116.27/117.15 .",
    "for the tokamak observations , n@xmath1(other ) is the experimental plasma density , determined from interferometry measurements to an accuracy of approximately @xmath1715%  @xcite .",
    "the first point to note from an inspection of table 2 is that the fexxi 123.83  line is clearly blended to a very significant degree in the eve observations , as the measured values of fexxi 123.83/(142.14 + 142.28 ) are both far greater ( by factors of 1.7 and 3.1 ) than the theoretical low density limit of 0.29 .",
    "as noted in section 2 , this line was not considered by @xcite in their assessment of eve flare data , although it is not predicted to be severely blended . however",
    ", blending species must make a much larger contribution to the total intensity than evisaged , including perhaps unidentified transitions .",
    "for the other fe ion lines in the eve spectra , the resultant intensity ratios imply electron densities that are reasonably consistent , with discrepancies that average only 0.3 dex from the mean value of log n@xmath1 = 12.4 for both flares .",
    "similarly , for the euve datasets , the line ratios lead to electron density estimates for each star that are consistent within the errors , and indicate average densities which show no significant discrepancies with those derived from a wider range of high temperature n@xmath1-diagnostic lines .",
    "differences between the mean densities and the values of n@xmath1(other ) average only 0.1 dex , and do not exceed 0.3 dex .",
    "we note that as the euve spectra analysed here are the sum of several sw datasets , the derived densities will not represent specific flare values , but rather time - averaged estimates over the duration of the observations . however , this is not an issue as we are only concerned with the consistency of densities derived from different line ratios , and hence a comparison of time - averaged values is appropriate .",
    "in addition , it is worth pointing out that the ratio values for individual flares are actually very similar to those from the summed spectra .",
    "for example , for au mic the measured fexxii 114.41/135.79 and 114.41/117.15 ratios in table 2 are 0.26 and 0.22 , respectively , while those for a specific flare ( interval b of @xcite ) are 0.30 and 0.23 .",
    "the similar ratio values reflect the fact that the spectral emission is dominated , as might be expected , by high density flaring plasma .",
    "however , we employ summed euve spectra in our work as these provide better signal - to - noise and hence more reliable detections , especially for weak features .    in the case of the tokamak spectra ,",
    "the derived average values of n@xmath1 are consistent with the experimental data in three out of four instances , with discrepancies of less than 0.2 dex .",
    "the exception is the plt data of @xcite at an experimental density of log n@xmath1 = 12.7 , where the diagnostics indicate log n@xmath1 = 13.2@xmath170.4 .",
    "this is due to the fexxii 114.41/135.79 ratio being much larger than expected ; the measured value is 0.60 , while for an experimental density of log n@xmath1 = 12.7 the theoretical ratio is only 0.28 .",
    "@xcite also noted this discrepancy , and it remains unexplained .",
    "however , the problem must lie with the 135.79  line measurement in the spectrum , as the fexxii 114.41/117.15 ratio shows no significant differences between theory ( 0.27 at log n@xmath1 = 12.7 ) and observation ( 0.33 ) , and hence the 114.41  experimental intensity should be secure .",
    "we note that there is no issue with the 135.79  line in the ftu spectrum of @xcite , with good agreement between the density derived from fexxii 156.02/135.79 ( log n@xmath1 = 13.8@xmath170.1 ) and the measured value ( log n@xmath1 = 13.9 )",
    ". furthermore , there is consistency between theory and observation for fexxii 114.41/135.79 in the plt spectrum for the log n@xmath1 = 13.5 plasma , with the measured value indicating log n@xmath1 = 13.7 , providing support for the reliability of the chianti line ratio calculations .",
    "the consistency of the electron densities determined from the eve observations , combined with that also found from the euve and tokamak data of similar spectral resolution , indicates that the line ratios in table 2 with the exception of fexxi 123.83/(142.14 + 142.28 ) should provide reasonable estimates of n@xmath1 for the high temperature ( @xmath010mk ) plasma in solar flares .",
    "more importantly , the euve and tokamak results provide support for the line ratio diagnostics being reliable up to very high values of n@xmath1 ( @xmath210@xmath6@xmath5 ) , and confirm the large densities derived for the solar events .",
    "@xcite found that two of the fexxi ratios in table 2  145.73/128.75 and ( 142.14 + 142.28)/128.75  provided good estimates of density at n@xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "( we note in passing that these authors also considered fexxi 121.21/128.75 , which we exclude as @xcite point out that the 121.21  feature is very weak and in the wing of the strong fexx 121.84  line ) .",
    "however , the present work significantly extends the @xcite analysis to show that four additional ratios of fexx and fexxii may be confidently used as diagnostics , even at the low spectral resolution of eve , and furthermore allow a high electron density regime to be reliably investigated . as eve obtains full - disk spectra at a very high cadence of 10s ( as opposed to its low spectral resolution ) , this in turn indicates that the observations may be employed for reliable temporally - resolved studies of flare densities in the high n@xmath1 regime ( @xmath010@xmath410@xmath6@xmath5 ) , and in particular the investigation of the maximum density that can be achieved during flare peak .",
    "the eve instrument has observed hundreds of flares during its 4 years of operation , providing a very large dataset for such studies .",
    "measurement of as many as possible of the line ratios in table 2 would be preferred , as the average densities are in better agreement with n@xmath1(other ) than the individual values , which show a large amount of scatter . however , the best diagnostics  based on their density sensitivity particularly at high n@xmath1 , and how well the derived densities agree with n@xmath1(other )  are probably fexx 113.35/121.85 , fexxi ( 142.14 + 142.28)/128.75 and fexxii 114.41/135.79 .",
    "now that we have confirmed the usefulness of megs - a data for determining high flare densities , the next step is to extend our analyses to the megs - b spectral region ( 3501050 ) , which samples lower temperature emission lines .",
    "the overall aim of this work will be to identify diagnostics which allow time profiles of flare densities simultaneously across a broad temperature range ( @xmath00.110mk ) .",
