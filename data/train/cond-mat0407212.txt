    "many authors have emphasized the importance of considering non - local coulomb interactions in describing doped systems like cuprate superconductors or fullerides @xcite .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian satisfying these requirements is the extended hubbard model , where a nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction term is added to the original hubbard hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of non - local coulomb interactions substantially modifies the electronic properties of the model .",
    "for instance , the charge transfer excitons , which can only be detected by optical spectroscopy at half filling , attain some charge in doped systems and become visible in direct and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies @xcite .",
    "other studies , using an effective extended hubbard model , support the appearance , upon doping , of states evenly distributed inside the gap @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the general features of the cuprates can be well described by using this effective hubbard hamiltonian , which has also been used to mimic some of their experimental features in the superconducting state by means of a bcs treatment @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model with intersite coulomb interaction is also one of the simplest models capable to describe charge ordering ( co ) in interacting electron systems . already in 1938",
    "wigner proposed @xcite that a low density interacting electron gas crystallizes in a lattice in order to minimize the coulomb repulsion . at higher densities crystallization",
    "is possible if the kinetics energy is reduced by spin or phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "charge ordering has been experimentally observed in a variety of systems : @xmath0 heterostructures @xcite , rare - earth pnictides like @xmath1 @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance compounds @xcite , unconventional spin - peierls materials @xmath2 @xcite , cuprates @xcite , manganites @xcite , magnetite @xcite , vanadium oxides @xcite , bechgaard salts @xcite .    among the many analytical methods used to study the extended hubbard model we recall : hartree - fock approximation @xcite , perturbation theory @xcite , dynamical mean field theory @xcite , slave boson approach @xcite , coherent potential approximation @xcite .",
    "numerical studies by means of quantum monte carlo @xcite , lanczos technique @xcite and exact diagonalization @xcite have also to be recalled .",
    "in this manuscript , we analyze the extended hubbard model by means of the composite operator method ( com ) within the 2-pole approximation ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the com is based on two main concepts : ( i ) the excitations present in interacting systems are far from being the original electrons and need to be described by asymptotic fields in the form of composite operators ; ( ii ) the use of composite operators requires the enforcement of the non - canonical algebra they obey in order to properly fix the representation where their propagators are realized .",
    "this latter task is effectively undertaken by computing the values of the unknown correlators appearing in the calculations by means of algebra constraints @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis of the instabilities of the homogenous paramagnetic phase of the extended hubbard model towards charge ordered inhomogeneous phases is the main task undertaken with this manuscript . with respect to this ,",
    "we have analyzed the rank of the transitions and their relations with the metal - insulator one . actually , this study is the only relevant at room temperatures and/or in presence of frustration as any spin ordered phase ( e.g. , the antiferromagnetic phase ) would be inaccessible in such situations .",
    "it is worth noticing that the very rich phase diagrams ( multiple first and second order phase transitions , critical points , reentrant behavior ) that have been found can be put in connection with the experimental findings relative to some manganese compounds @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed in detail the possibility of improving the capability of describing cuprates with respect to the simple hubbard model and the appearance of crossing points in the specific heat in presence of the intersite interaction .    in the next section we present the model , the basis and the solution according to the com . in the subsequent sections , we comment our results for the chemical potential , the phase diagram , the double occupancy , the nearest - neighbor density - density correlator , the internal and kinetic energies , the fermi surface , the density of states and the specific heat . the types of charge ordered phases found according to the sign of the intersite potential",

    "the second will be fixed by the local algebra constraint @xcite @xmath55 .",
    "such a procedure is very peculiar to the com treatment @xcite as discussed in the introduction . by solving the set of coupled self - consistent equations ( [ eq.5.1.11]-[pauli ] )",
    ", we can calculate the various correlation functions and the physical properties of the system .",
    "results will be presented in the following sections for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .    before moving to the results ,",
    "it is worth noting that the set of self - consistent equations ( [ eq.5.1.11]-[pauli ] ) is highly non - linear . according to this ,",
    "it is natural to expect a certain number of coexisting solutions with quite different features .",
    "actually , the set admits only two distinct solutions that , hereafter , we will call com1 and com2 , according to the main sign of parameter @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , as a function of the filling , we have a @xmath56 positive and of the order of the filling in com1 and a @xmath56 negative or very small and positive in com2 .",
    "as the composite operator method tries to give answers in the whole space of model and physical parameters and as the hubbard model response is profoundly different according to the region of the latter space , the presence of two solutions , so different in their features , should be seen as a richness of the method . due to the difficulties inherent to the task of studying the whole phase diagram",
    ", many other approximations focus just on one region and usually give wrong results in the rest of the parameter space .",
    "com , also thanks to the opportunity of choosing between the two solutions according to the features one expects to describe , has proved to be capable to explore the whole phase diagram , to get significatively good results for all dimensions and values of the tuning parameters , to give relevant interpretations of the experimental facts and to constitute a solid basis for further investigations .",
    "it is also worth remembering that , at the end of the day , our analysis has , as main goal , the description of features , more or less anomalous , of real physical systems by means of hamiltonian models .",
    "we can never be sure that our hamiltonian contains all , and only , relevant ingredients .",
    "different experimental situations can be described by different analytical ( and/or numerical ) solutions of the same hamiltonian . for a fixed set of parameters ( filling , temperature , pressure , ... ) , the different solutions will have different free energies and one can simply think to choose one or the other according to this .",
    "this is the correct procedure if we wish to answer the question : `` which is the phase effectively described by this hamiltonian under such external conditions ? '' . on the other hand",
    ", a solution different from the one with lower free energy can better describe the real experimental situation .",
    "this latter , although mainly determined by the ingredients already present in the hamiltonian ( the possibility to find a solution with similar characteristics assures this ) , is that effectively realized in nature owing to some marginal interactions not present in the hamiltonian chosen .",
    "if we would include such interactions in the hamiltonian and compute new solutions , we will find that the lower free energy one will be the one capable to describe the actual physical situation .",
    "now , the most important consideration to be done is that this latter solution will be essential identical to that obtained with the previous hamiltonian and that was already capable to describe the actual physical situation although it has not the lower free energy . according to this , in the comparison with the experiments no solution",
    "can be discarded a priori ( neither on the basis of the free energy determination ) and , with this idea in mind , we have here , and in many other works , presented the results for the two solutions we have obtained .    for the one - dimensional system we will consider only com2 solution as our past experience suggests that this is the one best suited to describe the physics of the simple one - dimensional hubbard model for which we got excellent agreements with the bethe ansatz exact solution @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , we will study both solutions as they will permit us to analyze , in particular in proximity of half filling and as regards the metal - insulator transition and its relation to the charge ordering transition , two different behaviors that could be both observed experimentally . also in this case the many positive comparisons with numerical results , that we have obtained in the previous studies on the simple two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , will be used as a guide throughout all the analysis .",
    "the chemical potential can be determined as a function of the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath57 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 by solving the system of self - consistent equations ( [ eq.5.1.11]-[pauli ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that our results show that the relation @xmath58 required by the particle - hole symmetry , is exactly satisfied . in particular at half filling we have @xmath59 .",
    "this is due to the fact that among the possible representations the algebra constraint coming from the pauli principle [ see first equation in eqs .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) ] selects the one which preserves the particle - hole symmetry of the model @xcite .",
    "any other choice for the equation fixing the parameter @xmath56 leads to a violation of the symmetry .",

    "[ fig.5.2.1 ] ( top ) for @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for any value of the filling the chemical potential increases by increasing the intersite coulomb interaction and the increment is an increasing function of the filling : within the paramagnetic phase the average probability for two particles to be nearest neighbors increases with the filling and accordingly increases the free energy in the presence of a repulsive intersite coulomb interaction , then , the behavior of the chemical potential follows .    for negative ( i.e. , attractive ) values of the intersite coulomb potential , we can see that the paramagnetic solution is unstable towards a phase with charge separation ( i.e. , with charge ordering ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", an attractive potential between charges at nearest neighbor sites favors a rearrangement of the particles in a one - particle - per - site scheme in order to maximize the gain in energy . at fillings less than one this scheme can lower the energy more and more by accepting more particle in the system and increasing the number of occupied couples of nearest neighbor sites .",
    "according to this , the chemical potential shows a negative slope which , on increasing the value of the intersite potential , manifests at lower and lower values of the filling .",

    "[ fig.5.4.4 ] , the double occupancy is plotted versus the filling for different values of the intersite coulomb potential . the behavior is very similar to what has been found in the 1d case .",
    "on increasing the intersite coulomb potential the double occupancy behaves as that of a non - interacting system ( i.e. , tends to @xmath133 ) .",
    "the double occupancy as a function of the onsite coulomb potential is studied in figs .",
    "[ fig.5.4.5 ] ( top ) and [ fig.5.4.5 ] ( bottom ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.4.5 ] ( top ) we observe , by decreasing the onsite coulomb potential , the transition from the insulating phase to the metallic phase and to the charge ordered phase . in the insulating state",
    "the double occupancy is quite depressed ; at the mit there is a discontinuity and the double occupancy rapidly increases by decreasing the onsite coulomb potential until encounters a second discontinuity when a co phase comes into play .",
    "the case where @xmath134 is studied in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.4.5 ] ( bottom ) ; in accordance with the phase diagram shown in fig .  [ fig.5.3.2 ] , there is no metallic phase ; by decreasing the onsite coulomb potential , the double occupancy regularly increases until the charge ordered phase is reached .",
    "the phase transitions are marked by a discontinuity in the double occupancy .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.4.6 ] where @xmath135 is plotted versus the onsite coulomb potential for different values of the intersite coulomb potential . for @xmath136 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.5.4.6 ] ( top ) ) we have two discontinuities , related to the mit and insulator to charge ordered phase transitions . for @xmath134",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig.5.4.6 ] ( bottom ) ) there is no metallic state and we observe only one discontinuity , related to the latter type of transition .    accordingly to the behavior of the double occupancy , for positive values of the intersite coulomb potential , the mobility of the electrons increases , signalling an overall tendency towards a charge density instability driven by the @xmath11 term ( see fig .  [ fig.5.4.8 ] ) , in agreement with the mean - field result @xcite .",
    "with respect to what we have found in the simple hubbard model@xcite , the overall shape and bending of the fermi surface of the system does not change on varying the intersite coulomb potential , but , almost rigidly , its volume decreases on increasing the intersite coulomb potential [ see figs .",
    "[ fig.5.5.1 ] ] .",
    "this can be explained as an isotropic increment of the available states in @xmath137-space and can be useful to describe quantitatively rather than qualitatively@xcite ( as the usual hubbard model does ) the arpes determinations of the fermi surface of the cuprate superconductors @xcite .    as we can see from figs .",
    "[ fig.5.5.1 ] ( top ) and [ fig.5.5.1 ] ( bottom ) , for given values of the onsite coulomb potential and the intersite coulomb potential , there is a critical value of the doping @xmath138 where the fermi surface is nested . at this critical value",
    "there is a crossing of the van hove singularity and the fermi level in the density of states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.5.5.2 ] ) .",
    "this feature may be related , in the framework of the van hove scenario , at the experimental results for the static susceptibility @xcite and specific heat @xcite in cuprate superconductors which exhibit well - definite peaks as functions of the filling .",
    "we have studied the value of the filling @xmath138 , the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.5.3 ] , where @xmath138 is plotted as a function of the intersite coulomb potential for various values of the onsite coulomb potential . as we can see , @xmath138 increases on increasing the intersite coulomb potential until a certain value of @xmath139 is reached . above this critical value of the onsite coulomb potential",
    "the influence of the intersite coulomb potential is almost zero .",
    "this is a clear indication that if we would like to explain the cuprate superconductors and their anomalous features by means of hubbard - like models , we need to exploit the intermediate regime for the onsite coupling and the weak regime for the intersite one . only in this region of the model parameters",
    ", @xmath138 is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the specific heat is shown in fig .  [ fig.5.6.1 ] for the one - dimensional case and in fig.[fig.5.6.3 ] for the two - dimensional one .      in 1d ,",
    "the net effect of the intersite coulomb repulsion is to reduce the splitting between the charge and spin energy scales with respect to what observed for the simple hubbard model , with a resulting more pronounced single peak at intermediate temperatures ( see fig.[fig.5.6.1 ] ) .",
    "as regards the 2d case , it is worth noting that there is a crossing point when the curves are plotted for different values of the onsite coulomb potential at fixed @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig.5.6.3 ] ) , but there is no crossing point when the onsite coulomb potential is fixed and different values of the intersite coulomb potential are considered .",
    "this can be seen as an indication of the fact that the two interaction terms act to different orders in a perturbation expansion for the double occupancy and the kinetic energy . in particular , there is no value of temperature for which the first derivative of the double occupancy and the kinetic energy with respect to the intersite coulomb potential does not depend on the intersite coulomb potential .",
    "the extended hubbard model , in one and two dimensions , has been studied by means of the composite operator method within the 2-pole approximation . according to the sign of the intersite coulomb potential ,",
    "transitions between the paramagnetic ( metal and insulator ) phase towards two kinds of charge ordered states ( one - particle - per - site and checkerboard types ) have been found .",
    "the rank of these transitions has been studied through the analysis of double occupancy , nearest - neighbor density - density correlator , kinetic and internal energies behavior .",
    "the evolution of the fermi surface and of the nesting filling has been tracked on changing the value of the intersite potential evidencing the range of parameters suitable to describe the experimental features of the cuprate superconductors .",
