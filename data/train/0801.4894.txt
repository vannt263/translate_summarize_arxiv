    "the hlc supplies a set of 229 derived quantities for each light - motion curve in the lmcc .",
    "these quantities are aimed at describing the mean magnitudes , photometric variability and astrometric motion of the objects in the lmcc , and they are calculated using only light - motion curve entries that satisfy the quality constraints from section  2.3 . those quantities in the hlc related to photometry",
    "are described in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] , while those related to astrometry are described in table  [ tab : hlc2 ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : hlc1 ] , if a tag name is associated with a 5-element array , then the 5 values represent the described quantity for each of the five sdss wave bands in the order @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when a certain wave band has insufficent `` good '' light - motion curve entries to calculate a particular quantity , a value of zero is stored ( this also applies to table  [ tab : hlc2 ] ) . for instance , the first value in the array mean_psfmag is set to zero for any light - motion curves with no `` good '' entries for the @xmath6 band .    all quantities in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] with clip at the end of the tag name",
    "are calculated using a 4@xmath13-clip algorithm that rejects only the worst outlier at any one iteration , and terminates when no more outliers are identified .",
    "similarly , all quantities in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] with iter at the end of the tag name are calculated using the iterative procedure described in @xcite to dynamically reweight data points based on the size of the residuals from the mean .",
    "both these sets of quantities have been designed to be more robust against outliers than a simple inverse variance weighted mean .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline performs a morphological star / galaxy separation , the quality of which is intimately related to seeing and sky brightness . while the accuracy is very good for bright objects , there can be confusion for faint objects .",
    "the quantity mean_object_type in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] is an unweighted mean of the sdss object type classification .",
    "hence it has a value of 3 if the object is classified as a galaxy at all epochs , a value of 6 if the object is classified as a star at all epochs , and a value between 3 and 6 otherwise .",
    "the reliability of mean_object_type for object type classification depends on the reliability of the sdss object type classifier and the number of epochs at which the object was observed .",
    "the quantity mean_child in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] is an unweighted mean of whether the child object bit is set or not . in other words ,",
    "this quantity has a value of 1 if , at all epochs , the object results from the deblending of a parent object , a value of 0 if the object was never the result of the deblending of a parent object , and a value between 0 and 1 otherwise .",
    "the galactic extinctions described by extinction in table  [ tab : hlc1 ] are derived using the maps of dust column density from @xcite .    for eclipse and flare detection in light curves",
    "we include the statistics ecl_stat and flare_stat ( table  [ tab : hlc1 ] ) in the hlc . in calculating these values ,",
    "we assume that any eclipse / flare event in a light curve will include only one photometric data point since the time elapsed between consecutive scans is at least one day . hence , for each photometric data point ( using psf magnitudes only ) , we calculate the statistic @xmath14 , based on a matched filter from @xcite , and defined by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the chi - squared value of a constant fit for each wave band to the whole light curve , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the chi - squared and number of degrees freedom , respectively , of a constant fit for each wave band to the out - of - eclipse / flare light curve . in order to avoid false positives",
    ", we only calculate @xmath14 for epochs with photometric data points that are `` good '' in at least two wave bands .",
    "the adopted values of ecl_stat and flare_stat are then taken to be the largest values of @xmath14 for photometric data points fainter and brighter , respectively , than the mean .",
    "we also record the corresponding values of @xmath19 for ecl_stat and flare_stat in the quantities ecl_redchisq_out and flare_redchisq_out respectively , along with the epoch of the putative eclipse / flare event in ecl_epoch and flare_epoch respectively .    in table",
    "[ tab : hlc1 ] , the stetson variability indices j , k and l ( @xcite ) for both the psf and exponential magnitudes are stored in the quantities with tag names starting stetson_index .",
    "we chose the @xmath8 band as the comparison wave band and consequently the third element in each of these six quantity arrays is set to zero .",
    "our final measure of light curve variability is via a quantity called the vidrih variability index .",
    "rms magnitude deviations for non - variable lightcurves plotted versus mean magnitude @xmath20 in a given wave band ( referred to as an rms diagram ) are scattered around a three parameter empirical exponential function @xmath21 , while the rms magnitude deviation of variable sources is expected to be noticeably larger .",
    "we consider two lightcurve samples , that of psf - like objects ( @xmath22 ) and non - psf - like objects ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "for each lightcurve sample and wave band , we iteratively fitted @xmath24 to the corresponding rms diagrams using a 3@xmath13-clip algorithm , employing psf magnitudes for the star lightcurve sample and exponential magnitudes for the galaxy lightcurve sample . in each case",
    "we also constructed a function @xmath25 describing the standard deviation of the scatter around @xmath24 via a four - degree polynomial fit to the standard deviation of the rms magnitude deviations measured in 0.25 magnitude bins .",
    "then , for any light curve , the vidrih index @xmath26 was calculated as its rms magnitude deviation minus @xmath24 , normalized by @xmath25 , with negative values set to zero , and it is stored in the quantities with tag names starting vidrih_index ( table  [ tab : hlc1 ] ) . note that due to the way the vidrih indices are constructed , vidrih_index_psf is only relevant to stars and vidrih_index_exp is only relevant to galaxies .    in table",
    "[ tab : hlc2 ] , we describe the quantities associated with the object astrometry . specifically we fit a proper motion model for celestial coordinates @xmath27 , in degrees , at heliocentric julian date @xmath28 , in days , for each light - motion curve : @xmath29 @xmath30 we set t0 as the weighted mean of the epochs of observation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the set of heliocentric julian dates for the positional measurements , and @xmath33 represents the set of uncertainties on the measured celestial coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath33 are calculated via equation  [ eqn : sig_coord ] .",
    "we solve for the quantities ra_mean , ra_pm , dec_mean and dec_pm by minimising the appropriate chi - squared using a downhill simplex algorithm .",
    "we calculate the uncertainties on these quantities , namely ra_mean_err , ra_pm_err , dec_mean_err and dec_pm_err , by assuming that @xmath36 ( a valid assumption for @xmath37 ) and noting that minimising the chi - squared for each of the resulting equations is a linear least - squares problem with an analytic solution .",
    "we supply the best - fit chi - squareds via the quantities ra_chisq_lin and dec_chisq_lin , and we record the number of positional measurements used in the fit in the quantity n_pos_epochs .",
    "we also supply the chi - squareds ra_chisq_con and dec_chisq_con for a model including only a mean position , which facilitates the calculation of the following delta chi - squared : @xmath38 the statistic @xmath39 may be used to calculate the significance of a proper motion measurement by noting that it follows a chi - square distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the whole fitting process is also iterated using a clipping algorithm that rejects the worst outlier at any one iteration , and terminates when the change in the fitted proper motion is smaller than 3  mas  yr@xmath40 . consequently",
    ", all the derived astrometric quantities described so far have a corresponding quantity calculated for the clipped positional measurements and stored in the hlc ( all quantities listed in table  [ tab : hlc2 ] with a tag name ending clip ) .",
    "the astrometric quantities derived from the clipped astrometric data are more robust than those derived from the unclipped astrometric data .",
    "we strongly advise that any statistical studies undertaken with the astrometry in the hlc should only use the clipped quantities .",
    "finally , we have attempted to detect the parallax signal for nearby stars by fitting a parallax model to each light - motion curve .",
    "however , our investigation has made it clear that the distribution of observations during the same few months each year along with the positional accuracy of the astrometric measurements are not enough to enable the detection of a clean parallax signal .",
    "the hlc is stored in eight fits binary tables , one for each hour in ra from 20@xmath2 to 4@xmath2 .",
    "each record in the hlc corresponds to a single light - motion curve and stores 229 derived quantities with tag names listed and described in tables  [ tab : hlc1 ] and [ tab : hlc2 ] .",
    "the fits files ( @xmath41.9  gb compressed ) may be obtained by web download from _",
    "http://das.sdss.org / value_added / stripe_82_variability / sdss_82_public/_.    the idl astronomy user s library function `` mrdfits '' is a convenient way to read - in the hlc , storing the fits binary table automatically in an idl structure .",
    "`` where '' function then becomes a very powerful tool for accessing subsets of data with ease .",
    "the most relevant comparison of our catalogue photometry can be made by comparing our results to those of @xcite ( from now on iv07 ) who use 58 pre-2005 sdss - i imaging runs of stripe 82 , observed under mostly photometric conditions , to construct a standard star catalogue .",
    "iv07 match unsaturated point sources satisfying high signal - to - noise criteria ( photometric uncertainties below 0.05  mag ) between runs and choose sources with at least 4 epochs .",
    "those objects that are identified as non - varying , by requiring a @xmath41 per degree of freedom for the mean magnitudes of less than 3 in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , are chosen as candidate standard stars .",
    "the standard star catalogue is then internally recalibrated , correcting for flat - field errors and time - variable extinction ( for example , due to clouds ) .",
    "the main differences between the lmcc and the iv07 catalogue are that we use a different photometric recalibration method , but based on the same idea of spatially dependent photometric zeropoints , and that we include the generally non - photometric observations from the sdss - ii supernova runs .",
    "not surprisingly , for the 886396 objects from the iv07 catalogue in the overlap area with the lmcc , we find unambiguous matches in the lmcc for 886191 objects using a match radius of 0.7 , where the missing fraction of @xmath40.02% can be explained by the different criteria used to construct the two catalogues .",
    "of the 886191 matching objects in the lmcc , 219627 , 606658 , 879766 , 886028 and 856456 objects have at least 3 good epochs in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands , respectively , and mean psf magnitudes brighter than 21.5 , 21.5 , 21.5 , 21.5 and 20.5  mag , respectively .",
    "it is these objects that we use when constructing the histograms in figure  [ fig : comp_ive ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_ive ] , each row of panels corresponds to a different wave band and the order employed is @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the top row to the bottom row .",
    "the left hand column of plots are normalised histograms of @xmath41 per degree of freedom for the mean psf magnitudes in the hlc , and they serve to confirm that the photometric uncertainties in the lmcc ( inherited from the sdss pipelines , with some adjustment during photometric recalibration ) are correct , since the histograms peak at a value of @xmath42  1 .",
    "the middle column of panels in figure  [ fig : comp_ive ] are normalised histograms of the uncertainties on the mean psf magnitudes in the hlc ( solid lines ) and on the mean magnitudes from the iv07 catalogue ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is clear that the mean magnitudes quoted in the hlc are approximately twice as precise as those from iv07 , which is due to the greater number of epochs included in the lmcc .",
    "however , systematic errors are still likely to dominate the mean magnitudes at the @xmath41% level , which corresponds to the level of the photometric recalibrations and to the systematic error introduced by the slightly different band passes of each column of detectors in the sdss camera .",
    "we do not correct the lmcc magnitudes for the different bandpasses in contrast to iv07 .",
    "the right hand column of panels in figure  [ fig : comp_ive ] are normalised histograms of the difference between the hlc mean psf magnitudes and the iv07 catalogue mean magnitudes .",
    "a gaussian has been fitted to each histogram ( dotted lines ) , and the fitted centre and sigma are quoted in each panel .",
    "the histograms are centred around zero at the millimagnitude level , except for the @xmath6 band where the iv07 photometry is slightly offset from the hlc photometry by @xmath44  mmag .",
    "the histograms have sigmas of 28 , 13 , 11 , 10 and 16  mmag in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , which are consistent with the scatter in the photometric zeropoints of the standard sdss runs derived in section  2.2 , and with the scatter in the similar internal photometric recalibrations of iv07 .",
    "the data set used to construct the iv07 standard star catalogue is a subset of the data used to construct the lmcc , and therefore we can use our superior temporal coverage to identify standard star candidates that are actually photometrically variable . @xcite",
    "use the hlc to systematically identify variable stars in stripe 82 , and we choose to follow all but one of their cuts on the hlc quantities .",
    "of the 886191 objects from the iv07 catalogue that have matching objects in the lmcc , 878172 have at least 11 good epochs in the @xmath7 band , allowing for the calculation of reliable variability and object type indicators .",
    "the requirement from @xcite that an lmcc object has a mean object type greater than 5.5 ensures that chosen variables are psf - like ( stars ) .",
    "however , this implies that 16529 objects are probably non - psf - like , corresponding to a fraction of @xmath41.9% .",
    "hence , we do not apply this requirement , and instead we directly apply the remaining requirements that a variable object should have a @xmath41 per degree of freedom greater than 3 for both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 band mean psf magnitudes , and a stetson l index greater than 1 for the @xmath7 band .",
    "we find that just 570 iv07 standard stars , from 878172 , are variable , corresponding to a fraction of @xmath40.065% .",
    "this confirms that even with the addition of many more photometric data , the iv07 standard stars are in general still found to be constant at the @xmath40.01  mag level . in considering the full iv07 catalogue with 1006849 candidate standard stars , we suspect that @xmath4650 are actually variables .",
    "@xcite ( from now on gk04 ) carefully combine sdss data release  1 ( sdss  dr1 ) and usno - b proper motions to produce a catalogue of 390476 objects with proper motions @xmath43  mas  yr@xmath40 and magnitudes @xmath44  mag .",
    "sdss  dr1 proper motions are based on matches of sdss to usno - a2.0 ( @xcite ) , which suffer from mismatches causing spurious high proper - motion objects , and systematic trends in proper motion .",
    "however , by cross - correlating sdss dr1 and usno - b , gk04 successfully removed the vast majority of spurious proper - motion stars .",
    "furthermore , by considering the set of spectroscopically confirmed quasars in sdss  dr1 , gk04 calibrate out the position - dependent astrometric biases , using a very similar method to our recalibration of sdss astrometry presented in section  2.4 .",
    "we compare our proper motions in the hlc to those derived by gk04 for the 30546 stars from their catalogue with an unambiguous positional match in the hlc using a match radius of 0.7 . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_usno ] , we plot the running 3@xmath13-clipped mean difference between our hlc proper motions and those of gk04 ( middle points ) as a function of ra using a 1@xmath0 window ( upper panels ) , as a function of dec using a 001 window ( middle panels ) , and as a function of mean @xmath8 psf magnitude using a 0.1  mag window ( lower panels ) .",
    "the mean difference is only calculated if there are at least 100 stars in the sliding window .",
    "the left hand panels correspond to proper motion in ra and the right hand panels correspond to proper motion in dec .",
    "we also plot the mean difference plus or minus the running 3@xmath13-clipped standard deviation as the upper and lower sets of smaller points , respectively , in each panel .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_usno ] illustrates that the systematic differences between the hlc proper motions and those of gk04 are at a very small level , generally @xmath452  mas  yr@xmath40 . we note one clear systematic trend that the gk04 dec proper motions are offset from the hlc dec proper motions by @xmath452  mas  yr@xmath40 , which is especially visible in the bottom right hand panel of figure  [ fig : comp_usno ] .",
    "we are currently unable to identify unambiguously the origin of the small systematic offset .",
    "the scatter in the proper motion differences ( represented by the upper and lower sets of smaller points in each panel ) is consistent with the stated proper motion uncertainties of @xmath43.9  mas  yr@xmath40 in gk04 , and @xmath455  mas  yr@xmath40 for these particular stars in the hlc .",
    "each light - motion curve in the lmcc has a different temporal coverage and number of epochs , a situation which is highlighted in figure  [ fig : tcov ] . consequently the uncertainties on the hlc proper motions exhibit a very inhomogeneous spatial distribution , and selecting proper motion objects using cuts on proper motion uncertainty results in a very inhomogeneous sample of objects . in figure",
    "[ fig : pmerr ] , we present the mean proper motion uncertainty in the hlc as a function of mean @xmath8 psf magnitude , number of epochs and time span of a light - motion curve for psf - like objects ( mean_object_type  =  6 ) .",
    "the three panels from left to right correspond to different light - motion curve time spans of 3 , 5 and 7 years , respectively , while in each panel three curves are plotted , dotted , dashed and continuous , corresponding to @xmath4610 , @xmath4720 and @xmath4830 epochs , respectively .",
    "the curves in each panel show the mean proper motion uncertainty in the hlc as a function of mean @xmath8 psf magnitude .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath476% of objects in the lmcc have at least 20 epochs , and that @xmath437% have at least 20 epochs with a time span of greater than 4 years .",
    "we find that 312819 objects in the lmcc ( or @xmath48% ) have proper motions @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the light - motion curve catalogue ( lmcc ) contains almost 4  million light - motion curves for stars and galaxies covering @xmath4249  deg@xmath5 in the sdss stripe 82 .",
    "a light - motion curve provides wave band and time dependent photometric and astrometric quantities , where @xmath476 per cent of light - motion curves in the lmcc have at least 20 epochs of measurements .",
    "the lmcc is complete to magnitude 21.5 in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and to magnitude 20.5 in @xmath10 , making it the deepest large - area catalogue of its kind .",
    "the photometric rms accuracy for stars is @xmath420  mmag at @xmath5118  mag and for galaxies it is @xmath430  mmag at @xmath5118  mag . in both the ra and dec coordinates , an rms accuracy of @xmath432  mas and @xmath435  mas at @xmath5118  mag",
    "is achieved for pre-2005 data for stars and galaxies , respectively , and an rms accuracy of @xmath435  mas and @xmath446  mas at @xmath5118  mag is achieved for 2005 data for stars and galaxies , respectively .    the lmcc is thus an ideal tool for studying the variable sky , and in order to aid in its exploitation , we have created the higher - level catalogue ( hlc ) .",
    "the hlc consists of 229 derived photometric and astrometric quantities for each light - motion curve , and it is stored in a set of fits binary tables , a format that is widely used by the astronomical community .",
    "the photometry presented in the hlc is fully consistent with the iv07 standard star catalogue and , since it is based on many more epochs , the random uncertainties in the mean magnitudes are smaller . reassuringly , we show that only a very small percentage of standard stars ( @xmath40.065% or @xmath4650 objects ) from iv07 are actually photometrically variable .",
    "the hlc proper motions of 30546 stars are consistent to within uncertainties with those derived by @xcite by combining sdss  dr1 and usno - b proper motions .",
    "the power in using the hlc is well illustrated by the work of @xcite who construct a reduced proper motion diagram for stripe 82 in order to find rare white dwarf populations , and consequently they identify 8 new candidate ultracool white dwarfs and 10 new candidate halo white dwarfs .",
    "also , @xcite report the discovery of an eclipsing m - dwarf binary system 2mass  j01542930 + 0053266 , having employed the corresponding light - motion curve along with radial velocity measurements to determine the masses and radii of the stellar components .",
    "we therefore encourage the astronomical community to actively use and explore these catalogues that are so ample in their content .",
