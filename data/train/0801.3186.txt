    "gw 123.41.5 revealed by the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite is a mushroom - shaped hi structure composed of a stem and a cap and is dissimilar to any common shells or chimneys @xcite . using the kinetic distance of the galactic rotation model ,",
    "@xcite derived properties of the mushroom cloud such as projected length , mass , velocity , mean excess column - density , and kinetic energy .",
    "the mushroom cloud extends a few hundred parsecs ( @xmath3 ) at the assumed distance of @xmath4 and has an hi mass of @xmath1 , a mean excess column - density of @xmath5 , and a kinetic energy of @xmath6 ergs . as a model for the origin of the mushroom - shaped cloud gw 123.41.5 , the gas buoyancy model @xcite and the cloud collision model ( *",
    "* hereafter kb2004 ) were proposed and numerical simulations were executed , respectively .",
    "@xcite carried out preliminary two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and showed that the origin of the mushroom - shaped gw 123.41.5 is the rise of buoyant gas from the explosion of a supernova above the galactic midplane . using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of large - scale modeling of the interstellar gas in the galactic disk @xcite , @xcite showed that the mushroom - shaped cloud can result from the buoyant rise of bubbles out of pools of hot gas created from a supernova or supernovae .",
    "however there is some difficulty in interpreting the origin of gw 123.41.5 by the buoyancy of a hot gas created by a single or multiple supernova explosions , because there are no observations of soft x - ray emission and iras sources near the base of gw 123.41.5 . on the other hand , the collision of a high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) with the galaxy , which was studied by @xcite for the first time ,",
    "is not restricted to the regions of active star formation @xcite .",
    "kb2004 performed two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the collision of a cloud with the galactic disk and proposed that gw 123.41.5 is created by the impact of an intermediate - velocity cloud ( ivc ) with the galactic disk .",
    "also they showed that the velocity structure across the cap of the mushroom - shaped structure in their simulation is consistent with that of gw 123.41.5 . in the buoyant models ,",
    "the velocity characteristic of the cap is not obvious . unlike the gas buoyancy model",
    ", cloud - disk collision can easily explain the formation of gw 123.41.5 without inference for x - ray emissions .    in this study",
    "we extend the two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of kb2004 to three dimensions , in order to investigate the origin , dynamics , and velocity structure of a mushroom - shaped structure . through numerical simulations and a parameter study",
    ", we can reproduce the size , shape , and position - velocity of the mushroom - shaped structure which resemble those of gw 123.41.5 .",
    "consequently , we can infer ( 1 ) how gw 123.41.5 was formed in the galactic disk and ( 2 ) why a mushroom - shaped structure is so rare on the galactic plane . in the next section",
    "we describe our models and numerical method .",
    "simulation results are presented in  iii , followed by a summary and discussion in  iv .",
    "we simply suppose an adiabatic gas as in kb2004 . as a galactic disk and halo model , we consider a hydrostatic equilibrium of the interstellar isothermal gas determined by the gravity and temperature . in this study",
    ", we use the cartesian coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "the galactic disk is located at the centered @xmath8 plane of a simulation box , and the @xmath9-axis is perpendicular to the galactic disk . near the galactic midplane , density distribution of the interstellar isothermal gas under hydrostatic equilibrium is well approximated as @xmath10 } , \\label{eq : hdst}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the density at the galactic midplane .",
    "the scale length is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the specific heat ratio @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the sound speed at the midplane .",
    "the observed vertical gravitational field is approximated as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 for the solar neighborhood of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we assume an external gravitational field and temperature distribution of interstellar gas at the initial stage as @xmath18 @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the temperatures of the disk and the halo .",
    "we assume @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as those in the previous two - dimensional simulations ( kb2004 ) . as an initial condition for the galactic disk and halo",
    ", we assume a hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas , which is determined by the galactic gravity of equation ( 3 ) and the temperature distribution of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the density distribution of the hydrostatic equilibrium is nearly equal to equation ( [ eq : hdst ] ) for @xmath28 , and it tends to be @xmath29 for @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to this hydrostatic equilibrium gas disk , we assume a cloud with density @xmath32 and velocity @xmath33 . using three - dimensional velocity @xmath34 and the incident angle @xmath35 , they are assumed as follows : @xmath36 \\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath37 \\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath38 @xmath39 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] is the distance from the cloud center",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 is a velocity of the cloud . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are parallel and perpendicular to the galactic disk , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for a colliding cloud .",
    "we perform three - dimensional numerical simulations using an eulerian hydrodynamics code based on the total variation diminishing scheme @xcite . while radiative cooling and magnetic fields are likely to be important to the dynamics of interstellar gas in the galactic disk , we ignore them due to numerical complexity and limited computational resources .",
    "radiative cooling and magnetic field will be considered in an upcoming paper .",
    "simulations are made with @xmath51 grid zones in @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath9-directions respectively , and the computational box size is taken @xmath54 .",
    "a free boundary condition is imposed on all outer boundaries of the computational box .",
    "simulations start at @xmath55 and last up to @xmath56 .",
    "all physical variables are expressed in units of the following normalization : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "this paper presents a total of seven simulations , which differ in density ( @xmath32 ) , radii ( @xmath60 ) , and incident angles ( @xmath35 ) of impact clouds .",
    "model parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "firstly , we present the case of the head - on @xmath61 collision to compare with the previous two - dimensional simulation ( kb2004 ) .",
    "figure 1 and 2 show the evolution of the density and pressure as well as the velocity field on the @xmath62 plane in model hh , in which the same parameters are taken as those of kb2004 ; @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the top - left panel depicts the initial conditions .",
    "the cloud collides with the galactic disk at @xmath65 , and penetrates through the dense midplane at @xmath66 . at @xmath67",
    "we can see that a bow shock is traveling toward the halo ( @xmath68 ) and a shell - like structure ( density enhancement around @xmath69 ) is formed by the cloud penetration ( the third snapshot ) .",
    "although the shell consists of a high - density gas , the pressure ( see fig.2 ) is not especially high compared with the post - bow shock gas .",
    "this elongated shell structure originates in the tenuous halo gas and the dense disk gas .",
    "the inside of the elongated shell is pervaded by a gas coming from the impact cloud ( @xmath70 ) . in the pressure plot ( fig.2 ) , two reverse shocks appear at @xmath71 .",
    "one is seen at the back of the cloud ( @xmath72 ) and the other is around @xmath73 at the same time .",
    "third and fourth snapshots of figure 2 indicate both reverse shocks bear the signature of the mach disk , which is formed by a reflection of the shock front on the @xmath9-axis .",
    "on the other hand , in the galactic disk , a cavity is left after the cloud penetration .",
    "three snapshots ( from the fourth to the sixth ) of figure 1 indicate that the cavity is gradually being refilled with the galactic disk gas .",
    "this seems to be driven by the radially inward pressure force ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the reverse shock which is formed at @xmath71 and propagates downward ( seen at @xmath75 ) interacts with the gas converging to the center of the cavity . the reverse shock hits the high - density gas at the age of @xmath76 , just when the cavity has been refilled . by the interaction between the shock wave and the converging gas",
    ", the converging dense gas is shock - heated and begins to rise along the @xmath9-axis ( @xmath77 : 7th and 8th snapshots ) .",
    "the gas at high latitude is broken into eddies or vortices and forms the cap of a mushroom - shaped structure ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the shock - heated rising gas contributes to filling the central part of the stem which is seen in the 7th and the last snapshots ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "similarly to kb2004 , the gas broken into eddies at the high latitude ( cap ) and the dense gas raised by the cavity replenishment ( stem ) have finally formed a mushroom - shaped structure .",
    "figure 3 and 4 depict the evolution of the density and pressure as well as velocity field in model hl . in this model ,",
    "the cloud is less dense @xmath80 but larger @xmath81 than that of model hh .",
    "although the initial cloud masses assumed in models hh and hl are quite similar , the initial kinetic energy @xmath82 of the hvc in model hl is 40 % less energetic than that in the previous model hh . because the density and velocity distributions of the cloud are not assumed to be uniform but to have smooth distributions ( eqs .",
    "( 5)(8 ) ) .",
    "dynamical evolution , density , and temperature distributions of the mushroom in model hl differ considerably from those in model hh .",
    "after a cloud collides with the galactic disk , a shell - like structure is formed inside the galactic disk at @xmath83 ( second and third snapshots ) .",
    "even if the cloud masses in both models are similar , the shell - like structure in model hl is different from model hh ; the lateral diameter of the shell @xmath84 ( third and fourth snapshots of fig.3 ) is much larger than that of the previous model @xmath85 ( third snapshot of fig.1 ) ; in contrast , the vertical size is half that of model hh . in the third snapshot",
    ", we can see a reverse shock at @xmath86 moving toward the galactic plane at @xmath87 .",
    "this shock wave propagates and reaches the midplane at @xmath88 ( fourth snapshot ) . at the same time , the cavity is refilled with the disk gas approaching from lateral directions pushed by the interstellar pressure ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the wave interacts with the refilled dense gas and forms a high - pressure gas , which is seen near @xmath90 in the 5th snapshot of figure 4 .",
    "this promotes the cavity replenishment and lifts the galactic dense gas along with the vortices ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "in model hh , the vortex structures have been developed before the cavity replenishment has been finished .",
    "however , in model hl , the vortices are developed in the process of the cavity replenishment at the galactic plane .",
    "the vortices , of which the central location is rising along the stem , play a major role in forming the cap of the mushroom .",
    "finally , the rising gas and vortices from the disk make a mushroom - shaped structure ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the rising gas is decelerated by the gravity of the galactic disk and eventually falls toward the disk , as seen in the last snapshot ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "figure 5 compares the density , velocity vector field ( top panels ) , and temperature ( bottom panels ) of the mushroom - shaped structure on the @xmath62 plane in models hh ( left ) and hl ( right ) .",
    "we can see the density and temperature differences between models hh and hl . in the case of model hh , the density shows a hollow in the stem which is filled with a hot gas . on the other hand , the stem of model hl has a high - density and low - temperature without any indication of the hollow .",
    "the difference comes from the formation processes of the stem .",
    "the stem of model hh was first formed from the gas which was originally a high - density disk and elongated into the low - density halo as the cloud collided with the disk and moved upward .",
    "later on , a high - density and low - temperature gas blew up and occupied the inner hollow , after the disk was replenished and collided with a reverse shock . on the other hand ,",
    "the stem of model hl is not formed until the disk gas blows up , because the disk gas is not sufficiently elongated upward when the cloud collides with the disk .",
    "then , the stem of model hh has a hot hollow structure during its evolution , but the stem of model hl is always occupied by the dense and cold gas .",
    "this difference can also explain the reason why the mushroom structure of model hl appears later than that of model hh .",
    "kb2004 showed that the cloud density should be of the same order as the disk density to attain a mushroom - shape .",
    "because the case of ivc ( @xmath93 ) showed a better agreement mainly with the height of the mushroom - shaped structure , they proposed that gw 123.41.5 was created by the impact of a high - density ( @xmath94 ) ivc with the galactic gas disk .",
    "our model hl shows that the mushroom - shaped structure can also be made by the collision of a low - density ( @xmath95 ) hvc ( @xmath96 ) with the galactic disk , if the size of the cloud is sufficiently large . whether for hvc or for ivc , the cloud - disk collision finally forms a mushroom - shaped structure .",
    "therefore we may conclude that cloud collision with the galactic disk is a promising model for the mushroom - shaped gw 123.41.5 .      in this section",
    ", we explore oblique collisions with different incident angles ( see table 1 ) . as models of oblique collision",
    ", we assume the same cloud in model hl and change only the incident angle of the cloud .",
    "figure 6 and 7 show the column - density and initial velocity ( white arrows ) of a cloud on the @xmath97 plane and the @xmath98 plane , respectively .",
    "we integrate the density along the @xmath53-axis ( fig.6 ) and @xmath52-axis ( fig.7 ) to get a column - density at @xmath99 ( middle panels ) and @xmath100 ( bottom panels ) for four models with different incident angles ( @xmath35 is an angle between the vertical axis of the galactic disk and the initial velocity vector of a cloud ) , @xmath101 ( model o5 ) , @xmath102 ( model o10 ) , @xmath103 ( model o20 ) , and @xmath104 ( model o30 ) , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of model o3 ( @xmath105 ) is shown in figure 8 by the snapshot of column - density distribution .",
    "figure 6 shows that a variety of structures such as mushroom - shape ( bottom panel of model o5 ) , shell / loop - like ( middle panels of models o5-o30 ) , and vertical structures ( bottom panels of models o5-o20 ) are effectively formed by cloud - disk collisions . after the cloud - disk collision , a variety of structures are quickly created by a subsequent process of cavity replenishment , gas rise , and eventual fall back due to the gravity of the galactic disk .",
    "the dynamical evolutions of oblique collisions are roughly similar except for the final structures .",
    "the resultant structures formed by cloud - disk collision are greatly affected by the incident angle .",
    "when we observe the cloud - disk collision on the @xmath98 plane ( fig.7 ) , the projected structure ( column - density integrating along the @xmath52-axis ) evolutions in each model look very similar besides resultant structures ( bottom panels ) .",
    "first , a shell and cavity are created , as seen at @xmath99 ( middle panels ) , then change to vertical structures which penetrate the galactic disk vertically .",
    "like the resultant structures observed on the @xmath97 plane ( bottom panels of fig.6 ) , the vertical structures projected at @xmath106 are mainly influenced by the incident angle at the @xmath97 plane . from this parameter test , we can comprehend that cloud - disk collision of the large incident angle ( model o10 , o20 , and o30 ) can hardly create a mushroom structure .",
    "therefore if we can observe a mushroom structure along the @xmath52-direction , the incident angle at the @xmath97 plane must be small @xmath107 .",
    "obliquely colliding clouds have initial velocity @xmath43 and @xmath44 given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 8) . the initial trajectory of the colliding clouds is represented by white arrows in the middle ( @xmath99 ) and bottom panels ( @xmath100 ) of figure 6 . at first glance ,",
    "the resultant structures in the middle panels ( especially for @xmath108 ) seem to be formed by the collision of a cloud moving from right to left , contrarily to the real situation . as a consequence of the cloud collision , a structure expanding in @xmath109 region is formed as well as the upwardly expanding main component .",
    "this countersplash , which is named for the structure seen in @xmath109 , seems to be a wake of the colliding cloud .",
    "if we misidentify this splash as a wake , we may consider the cloud moved from right to left .    in a preliminary parameter test",
    "( we do not report the simulations in this paper ) , we considered several clouds which have a variety of velocity ( @xmath110 ) and mass ( @xmath111 ) . when the kinetic energy of the cloud is larger than @xmath112 ergs , the structures after the cloud - disk collision are @xmath113 vertical structures .",
    "we did not explore these structures , because their size is much larger than the hi mushroom structure . on the other hand if the kinetic energy of the cloud is smaller than @xmath114 ergs ( _ i.e. ,  _",
    "@xmath115 ) , the colliding cloud does not penetrate the disk such as described in the previous two - dimensional simulation ( kb2004 ) or does only make shell / loop - like structures near the galactic plane . in this study ,",
    "our concern is focused on the formation of the mushroom - shaped cloud .",
    "we chose the incident kinetic energy of the cloud as @xmath116 ergs .",
    "figure 6 clearly shows that the cloud - disk collision can hardly make a mushroom - shaped structure , when the incident angle of a colliding cloud is larger than about @xmath101 . among our simulation results , the model o3",
    "( @xmath117 ; fig.8 ) can describe gw 123.4 - 1.5 most closely .",
    "then , the mushroom - shaped structure gw123.4 - 1.5 is likely produced by the approximately head - on collision of the cloud with a velocity of @xmath118 , a mass of @xmath1 , and thus a kinetic energy of @xmath116 ergs .",
    "figure 8 shows the evolution of column - density on the @xmath97 plane ( integrating along the @xmath53-axis ) for model o3 .",
    "we can find the mushroom - shaped structures between @xmath119 ( at @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 ( at @xmath122 ) .",
    "the height of the mushroom at the age of @xmath123 is about @xmath124 , which is the same size as that of gw 123.41.5 .",
    "the lifetime of the mushroom structure is @xmath125 and the width ratio of the cap to the stem is about 3:1 .",
    "the mass of the cap is about twice that of the stem , and the total mass is estimated to be @xmath1 . to obtain the mass of the mushroom - shaped cloud , we integrate the low - temperature gas with @xmath126 . the mean column - density contrast between",
    "the mushroom and ambient medium is about 2:1 .",
    "although the mass ratio is a little smaller than the observed one 4:1 @xcite , most physical parameters of the mushroom - shaped structure in model o3 coincide with those of gw 123.41.5 .    in order to explain the velocity structure of the mushroom - shaped structure from the two - dimensional simulation",
    ", kb2004 assumed that the mushroom - shaped cloud is tilted to the line - of - sight and calculated the line - of - sight velocity from their two dimensional simulation .",
    "however , without any presumption , we can reproduce the position - velocity map of the mushroom - shaped cloud from the three - dimensional simulation .",
    "figure 9 shows the column - density and the position - velocity maps , which are equivalent to the observational longitude - velocity ( @xmath127 ) maps , for model o3 . in order to distinguish the mushroom gas from the surroundings ,",
    "we integrate only the low - temperature gas ( @xmath126 ) along the @xmath53-axis ( fig.9a ) and the @xmath52-axis ( fig.9b ) , respectively .",
    "figure 9a corresponds to the case observed from @xmath128 and figure 9b from @xmath106 .",
    "the position - velocity plot of figure 9a indicates the symmetry with respect to @xmath129 axis for both the bottom ( @xmath130 ) and the upper ( @xmath131 ) regions of the cap . on the other hand",
    ", the position - velocity plot of figure 9b shows that the upper part of the cap has no significant velocity gradient , but the bottom has two distinct lobes blue - shifted with respect to the center of the cap by about @xmath132 .",
    "this velocity gradient is very similar to the observed value of gw 123.41.5 ( fig.1c of * ? ? ?",
    ". observed ( gw 123.4 - 1.5 ) and simulated ( model o3 ) mushroom - shaped clouds are compared in table 2 . using model o3 which fits the observations best",
    ", we can infer that gw 123.41.5 is created by a hvc with a velocity of @xmath0 coming toward us with @xmath133 and a mass of @xmath1 collided with the galactic disk about @xmath2 ago .",
    "we perform three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for the impact of a hvc with the galactic disk , in order to explore the formation of the mushroom - shaped hi cloud gw 123.41.5 .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * a mushroom - shaped structure can be formed not only by a high - density ivc collision with the galactic disk ( kb2004 ) but also by a low - density hvc collision . * the resultant structures formed by cloud - disk collision are greatly affected by the density and incident angle of a colliding cloud . * gw 123.41.5",
    "is expected to be formed by the almost head - on collision of a hvc with velocity @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 about @xmath2 ago .",
    "recently , @xcite have tried to find a mushroom - shaped hi structure like gw 123.41.5 in the canadian galactic plane survey .",
    "however , they did not find other mushroom shape structures .",
    "our simulations could explain why mushroom - shaped structures are so infrequent in our galaxy .",
    "a nearly head - on collision is needed to form a mushroom - shaped structure . in a rotating disk ,",
    "the head - on collision of a cloud with the galactic plane would be rare in a general way .",
    "hvc - disk collision can not only explain the origin of a mushroom - shaped structure but also the formation of a variety of structures like shells , loops and vertical structures in our galaxy .",
    "for example , in model o30 ( see the middle panel of fig.6 ) , we can find an interesting structure , a loop which resembles that found by nanten in the central molecular zone within @xmath134 from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the two loops of co emission obtained with nanten have strong velocity gradients in a longitude - velocity diagram : @xmath135 per @xmath136 and @xmath137 per @xmath138 in each loop ( see fig.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "although the projected velocity distribution of our simulation ( @xmath139 ) is somewhat smaller than that of observation ( @xmath140 ) , the size of the loop , @xmath141 , is similar to that of the molecular loop . in order to explain the formation of the molecular loop",
    ", @xcite proposed a magnetic flotation model ( due to magnetic buoyancy caused by the @xcite instability ) . from our preliminary result of model o30",
    ", we also propose that hvc - disk collision is another possible model of formation of the molecular loop structure at the galactic center .",
    "this issue will be studied in detail in an upcoming paper .",
    "the present study as well as the previous study ( kb2004 ) are restricted to hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "when the magnetic field parallel to the galactic disk exists @xcite , we also expect the magnetic buoyant effect ( parker instability ) .",
    "both the impact of the cloud and the parker instability @xcite may create complicate structures in the galactic disk such as worms , loops , shells , and chimneys . moreover the interaction between the infalling hvcs and the magnetized disk must be an elementary process in the interstellar dynamics .",
    "using high - resolution two - dimensional mhd simulation , @xcite pointed out a possibility that the rain of compact hvcs onto the disk can maintain transonic turbulent motion in the warm phase of hi . in this sense",
    ", we believe that high - resolution three - dimensional mhd simulation will broaden our understanding of the structures formed by hvc collisions and bring us more interesting phenomena to be important in the interstellar dynamics . in the near future",
