    "nuclear regions of galaxies are the breeding ground of high energy phenomena and processes , which are manifested observationally by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and star - bursts .",
    "such activities are believed to be important in both regulating galaxy evolution and generating thermal and chemical feedback into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the best site for a detailed study of the activities and their complex interaction with the physically extreme environment in the nuclear regions of galaxies is our own nucleus , only @xmath3 kpc away .",
    "we can observe the galactic center ( gc ) with a spatial resolution and sensitivity that are factors @xmath4 and @xmath5 better than those available for even nearby nuclear starburst galaxies ( e.g. , m82 and ngc 253 ) or agns ( e.g. , m81 ) .    while the super - massive black hole at the dynamic center of the galaxy is only weakly active at present @xcite , much of the current high - energy activity in the gc is due to the presence of the three young massive stellar clusters in the central 50 pc : arches ( with age equal to @xmath6 yrs ; core or half - mass radius 0.4 pc ) , quintuplet ( @xmath7 yrs ; 1.0 pc ) , and the central cluster ( @xmath8 yrs ; 0.5 pc ) ( figer et al .",

    "; genzel et al .",
    "these clusters are responsible for about half of the lyman continuum flux emitted in the central several @xmath9 pc of the gc .",
    "massive stars are also expected to release large amounts of mechanical energy into the gc region in form of fast stellar winds and supernovae , although the actual rate is highly uncertain .",
    "this mechanical energy input shapes the surrounding ism .",
    "the present work focuses on the  and  clusters .",
    "the gc cluster is less massive and older .",
    "its location in the circum - nuclear region makes its x - ray properties difficult to characterize and will not be dealt with here ( however see @xcite ) .",
    "both the  and  clusters are known x - ray emitters . discovered serendipitously at a large off - axis angle ( @xmath10 ) in an initial 50 ks _",
    "acis - i observation @xcite , the x - ray emission arising from the  cluster was resolved into discrete and diffuse components . in a later 12 ks acis - i observation during a large - scale gc survey @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray core of the cluster was further resolved into two separate components @xcite .",
    "the apparent diffuse x - ray component was speculated to arise from the so - called cluster wind @xcite .",
    "because of the high number density of massive stars , their stellar winds collide with each other and can be largely thermalized to form a plasma with an initial temperature of a few times @xmath11 k. the expanding of this plasma may then be considered as a wind from the entire cluster .",
    "however , the quality of the previous observations is not adequate for a quantitative test of this scenario . in particular",
    ", the diffuse x - ray spectrum shows a distinct 6.4-kev emission line from neutral or weakly ionized irons .",
    "the origin of this line is unknown .",
    "the x - ray emission from the  cluster is substantially weaker .",
    "the detection of a few discrete sources and possible diffuse emission in the region has been reported ; but detailed spectral and timing information is not yet available @xcite    to further the study of these two clusters and their relationship to the environment , we have obtained an 100 ks  acis - i observation .",
    "we have further carried out a complementary imaging study of the molecular gas in the immediate surroundings of the arches cluster using the six - element owens valley millimeter array . with these observations and other multi - wavelength data , we present an in - depth study of various point - like and diffuse x - ray sources in and around the clusters .    in this paper , we assume that the distance to the gc is 8 kpc ( hence @xmath12 2.5 pc ) and quote statistical errors from our x - ray data analysis at the 90% confidence level , unless being pointed out otherwise .",
    "the solar abundance is in reference to @xcite ; thus the number of iron relative to hydrogen is @xmath13 , which is considerably greater than @xmath14 in the so - called ism abundance @xcite , for example .",
    "our deep  acis - i observation ( obs .",
    "i d : 4500 ) was carried out on june 9 , 2004 .",
    "the  cluster was placed about 1@xmath15 away from the aim - point to minimize the effect of the ccd gaps on mapping the extended x - ray emission around the cluster .",
    "this slight offset from the axis had a negligible effect on the spatial resolution for the  cluster .",
    "we used the `` very faint '' mode for a better discrimination and removal of charged particle induced events .",
    "we have reprocessed the data , using the ciao software ( version 3.2.1 ) and calibration database ( version 3.0.0 ) .",
    "this reprocessing includes both charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and gain corrections as well as the removal of time intervals contaminated by background flares . the total reprocessed good time ( live - time )",
    "is 98.6 ks .",
    "we create acis - i event images and corresponding exposure maps in the 1 - 2.5 , 2.5 - 4 , 4 - 6 , and 6 - 9 kev bands .",
    "we detect x - ray sources , following the same procedure as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the detection , optimized for point - like sources , uses a combination of algorithms : wavelet , sliding - box , and maximum likelihood centroid fitting .",
    "the source detections are carried out in the 1 - 4 kev , 4 - 9 kev , and 1 - 9 kev bands .",
    "the detected sources in the three bands are merged together .",
    "multiple detections with overlapping 2@xmath16 centroid error circles are considered to be the same source , and the centroid with the smallest error is adopted .",
    "the accepted source candidates generally have individual local false detection probabilities @xmath17 .",
    "but in the vicinity ( @xmath18 field ) of the clusters , we also include sources detected with reduced significances @xmath19 . over the entire search ,",
    "the expected false detection probability is @xmath20 .",
    "we check the astrometry of the x - ray observation , based on the multi - wavelength comparisons .",
    "a simbad search gives some potential counterparts within the 3@xmath16 error radius around each detected x - ray source .",
    "a few sources in the  cluster have radio counterparts , which have accurate positions ( @xmath21 ; @xcite . a comparison of the two bright x - ray / radio pairs ( 92/ar1 and 93/ar4 ; table  [ t : sou_cl ] ) shows that their positions are all within @xmath22 , consistent with their statistical and systematic uncertainties ( table  [ t : sou ] ) .",
    "finding exact matches of x - ray sources with near - ir objects is generally more difficult , because they are numerous and typically have relatively large absolute position uncertainties of @xmath23 .",
    "we approximately correct for the relatively shifts of the near - ir positions to the x - ray positions , using the original  nicmos observations of the  and quintuplet clusters as well as the coordinates of individual nir objects ( 2 , 6 , 7 , and 9 for the  and 211 , 242 , 231 , and 257 for the ) listed in @xcite .",
    "hst_-to-  ra . and",
    "shifts are -052 and 029 for the arches cluster and -043 and -032 for the quintuplet cluster , respectively .",
    "these shifts are then applied to the nicmos images to facilitate the comparison with the x - ray data .",
    "the uncertainties in these astrometry corrections should be around @xmath22 , dominated by the errors in the x - ray source centroids .    to construct `` diffuse '' x - ray maps , we excise the detected sources from the acis - i data .",
    "for each source with a count rate ( cr ) @xmath24 , we exclude a circular region with a radius of 1.5 times the 90% psf energy enclosed radius ( eer ) . for sources with cr @xmath25 0.01",
    "cts / s , this radius is multiplied by an additional factor of 1+log(cr/0.01 ) to further minimize the contamination from the psf wing .",
    "for the background subtraction in our imaging analysis , we use the blank - sky data with a total exposure of 550 ks .",
    "the data are re - projected to mimic individual observations .",
    "the background subtraction is mostly to remove the contribution from events induced by charged particles .",
    "of course , the blank - sky data also contains cosmic x - ray radiation .",
    "its intensity varies from one part of the sky to another , mostly at energies below @xmath20 kev . at higher energies ,",
    "the radiation is negligible , compared to the fluxes due to charged particle - induced events and to the emission from the gc region .",
    "the combination of the background subtraction and the exposure correction then gives the flat - fielded intensity images in individual bands .",
    "in addition to the broad - band images , we also construct narrow - band images of the prominent 6.4-kev and 6.7-kev emission lines in the energy ranges of 6.25 - 6.55 kev and 6.55 - 7 kev . because the counting statistics at energies greater than 7 kev is too poor , we estimate the continuum contribution to these narrow bands , based on the intensities measured in the 4 - 5 kev and 5 - 6.2 kev bands . we assume an intrinsic power law spectral shape of the blank - sky background - subtracted diffuse emission in the 4 - 7 kev range and account for both the effective area and energy response of the instrument , using the convolved model outputs from the x - ray spectral analysis software xspec .",
    "the continuum - subtracted line intensity image , divided by the specific continuum intensity , gives the equivalent width ( ew ) map of the line .",
    "the calculation at each image pixel is carried out adaptively , using a gaussian kernel with its size adjusted to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio greater than five at each step .",
    "we further include all available archival acis - i observations that were taken before our deep observation and covered the clusters @xcite in analyzes that do not require the maximum spatial resolution offered by our on - axis observation .",
    "the combined data have an effective exposure of 157 ks at  and 160 ks at .",
    "source detections are also carried out for these individual observations and are used to examine the potential long - term variability of the sources in the close vicinity of the clusters . for detailed spatial and spectral analyzes of the  cluster ,",
    "we use only our on - axis deep  observation .",
    "but for the  cluster , all the observations are off - axis and and are thus used . because the effective area and spectral response depend on both time and position , we extract spectra from individual observations separately and then combine them together using the ftools routine `` addspec '' , which produces weighted effective area and spectral response files .",
    "all spectral extractions use the `` gaussian error '' , not the `` poisson error '' , which is the default of the ciao _ psextract _ routine and actually uses the gehrels s approximation @xcite .",
    "this latter method could cause problems in the error propagation through the spectral co - adding . for bright x - ray point - like sources in the  cluster , we typically group such spectra to achieve a minimum 20 counts per bin .",
    "for diffuse x - ray emission spectra , the noise contribution from the subtracted background becomes important .",
    "we group the spectra to have the _ background - subtracted _ signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in each bin greater than 3 for the  cluster and 2 for the  cluster with fainter diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the region around the gc radio arc ( where the quintuplet and arches clusters are located ) harbors a number of large , dense molecular clouds .",
    "the so - called `` @xmath26 cloud '' is believed to be ionized by the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath27 10@xmath28 ) observations of part of this cloud complex which immediately surrounds the arches cluster were made in the 3.4 mm continuum and cs ( j=2 - 1 ) line using the six - element millimeter array at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) in march , april , may and june 2002 .",
    "two telescope configurations ( equatorial and low ) were used , with baselines ranging from 15 to 100 m. six fields with a primary beam of 60@xmath28  were observed in a mosaic pattern , with a spacing of 30@xmath28 .",
    "the resulting mosaic covers an area of approximately 4@xmath29 centered on the position @xmath30 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the total integration time on each of the six fields was approximately 4 hours .",
    "nrao 530 , 3c 273 , and neptune were used for gain , passband , and absolute flux calibration , respectively .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mma package ( scoville et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the mosaicking was carried out with the maximum entropy method of de - convolution implemented in the miriad routine mosmem ( cornwell & braun 1988 ; sault , staveley - smith , & brouw 1996 ) .",
    "the cs ( j=2 - 1 ) line data were taken at a rest frequency of 97.981 ghz , with 64 channels of 0.5 mhz width , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 1.53 @xmath31 and a total velocity coverage of 96 @xmath31 .",
    "the line was centered on @xmath32 @xmath31 .",
    "simultaneous 3.4 mm continuum observations were made with a bandwidth of 1 ghz .    the largest spatial scale to which the ovro interferometer is sensitive is 20@xmath28 , corresponding to the shortest baseline of 15 m at 3.4 mm .",
    "therefore , more extended structures are not detected . in order to recover the missing flux density , the total power measurements from single - dish observations of this region",
    "have been added .",
    "single - dish observations of the cs ( 2 - 1 ) line in the -30 @xmath31 molecular cloud were carried out with the _ iram _ 30 m telescope by @xcite .",
    "spectra in the vicinity of the arched filaments complex were obtained at regular grid spacings of 18@xmath28and imaged with a single - dish beam size of 25@xmath28 .",
    "these observations were centered at @xmath33 @xmath31 , using a 512-channel filter bank with 1 mhz resolution , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 3.06 @xmath31 .    since there is reasonable overlap between the shortest spacings of the ovro interferometer ( 4 kilo - lambda ) and the diameter of the 30 m antenna ( 8 kilo - lambda ) , the linear technique of `` feathering '' single - dish and interferometer data is appropriate .",
    "this method requires that the single - dish data be a good representation of the object at low spatial frequencies , and that the interferometer mosaic be a good representation at mid - to - high spatial frequencies .",
    "the feathering technique can be carried out using the miriad task immerge .",
    "we input de - convolved and restored single - dish and interferometric images with the same velocity resolution and spatial grid .",
    "immerge first transforms the images into the fourier plane , where the data are combined . in the case of the 30 m single dish data and ovro millimeter array data ,",
    "the flux densities in the overlap region ( 4 - 8 kilolambda ) agree at the 10% level .",
    "the single - dish data are given unit weight , and the low spatial frequencies of the interferometer data are adjusted in the fourier plane with a taper such that a combination of the single - dish and interferometer data results in an image with a gaussian beam equal in diameter to the beam of the input interferometer mosaic image ( @xmath279  @xmath349 ) .",

    "the relatively small @xmath210 value is consistent with the weak cs emission from the ambient gas , probably representing the inter - clump medium of the colliding cloud .",
    "while the shocked cluster wind should be constantly flowing out from the bow shock at a velocity comparable to the sound velocity @xmath214 , we can also estimate the ionization time scale as @xmath215 , which is much too large to explain the 6.4-kev line emission with an _",

    "this explanation requires the presence of a luminous x - ray source with a spectrum consistent with the observed power law continuum with a photon index of @xmath217 . because such a source is currently not present in the gc , the observed emission is proposed to be the reflection of past sgr a * , with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath218 , about a few hundreds years ago .",
    "however , the fluorescence interpretation has difficulties in accounting for the 6.4-kev line emission regions closer to sgr a*. a comparison of the cs emission and the diffuse 6.4-kev line intensity does not show a peak - to - peak correlation , which should be expected because the gas traced by the cs emission is expected to be optically thin to the iron ionizing radiation @xcite . as shown in   [ ss : cs_dist ] , the detailed correlation is also absent in the  cs cloud .",
    "this difficulty may be avoided , if the cs emission does not trace well the actual gas distribution ( e.g. , due to the destruction of the molecule by the strong uv radiation from the  cluster ) . even in this case , however , the gas column density of the cloud can not be much greater than @xmath219 , constrained by both the x - ray absorption and the near - ir extinction distribution (   [ ss : d_envi ] ) . following @xcite , we estimate the required x - ray luminosity of sgr a * to produce the detected 6.4-kev line intensity of the  ( fig .

    "of course , the actual distance is likely to be greater , and the required @xmath189 should then be higher .",
    "this common interpretation of the 6.4-kev line enhancement and those associated with sgr b2 and sgr c , though difficult to rule out completely , would not explain the apparent position coincidence between the cloud and the cluster .",
    "alternatively , one may consider the  cluster as the origin of the hard x - rays .",
    "but this possibility can be easily dismissed because of the absence of the 6.7-kev line ( which is strong in both the point - like sources and in the cluster core ) in the 6.4-kev line enhancement .",
    "furthermore , the observed x - ray luminosity of the cluster is more than a factor of @xmath9 short of what is required for the fluorescence interpretation .",
    "a more plausible scenario for the  6.4-kev line enhancement is the lecre - induced fe k - shell vacancy filling @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the continuum is due to the bremsstrahlung radiation of the lecre .",
    "the expected power - law photon index of the continuum is 1.3 - 1.4 over the range of 1 - 10 kev , consistent with our measured value of the se extension ( table  [ spec_d ] ) .",
    "the lecre may be produced in strong shocks that are present within the  cluster and in both the forward bow shock and the reverse - shock in the cluster wind ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that a shock of velocity @xmath222 into a molecular cloud , accompanied by magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence , can provide a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of nonthermal lecre . @xcite",

    "the diffuse x - ray enhancement has a bow - shock morphology and is presumably linked to the site of particle acceleration .",
    "but , because of particle diffusion and gas flow , one does not expect a peak - to - peak correlation of the x - ray emission with the cs emission from the colliding cloud .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the lecre energy density required to produce the observed 6.4-kev line intensity .",
    "if the _ shocked _ gas density is @xmath223 , the required energy density is then @xmath224 , substantially greater than the value @xmath225 from averaging over the galactic ridge @xcite . but the implied pressure inside the bow shock can still be balanced by the high ram - pressure ( @xmath226 ) of the collision between the cluster wind and the cs cloud . in short",
    ", the bow shock provides a plausible interpretation of the distinct spatial and spectral properties of the diffuse x - ray emission around the cluster and its physical relationship to the cs cloud .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the 6.4-kev line enhancement represents the reprocessed x - rays from numerous discrete and faint sources embedded around the  cluster .",
    "a natural candidate for such sources might be low - mass pre - main sequence young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "but they are in general not known to emit strong 6.4-kev line emission . in the orion nebula , for example , the line emission is detected from only a few ysos and with ews less than 300 kev .",
    "therefore , ysos are probably not a significant contributor to the 6.4-kev line enhancement .",
    "the overall luminosity of the diffuse x - ray emission provides a fundamental limit to the population of ysos and hence the imf of the  and  clusters .",
    "ysos in the mass range of @xmath227 typically have large @xmath228 ratios and hard x - ray spectra .",
    "most importantly , they can be numerous , as shown in the _ chandra _ orion ultra - deep project @xcite .",
    "though with a",
    "_ 2 - 8 kev luminosity of only @xmath229 per star , ysos collectively account for about 75% of the luminosity of the orion nebula , the imf of which is consistent with the standard miller & scalo ( 1979 ; ms hereafter ) , based on the work by @xcite . if the clusters in the gc have a similar imf , ysos should then be equally important .    at the gc , typical ysos can not be detected individually , but can be constrained collectively in _",
    "chandra _ observations . based on the diffuse x - ray intensity observed around sgr a * ,",
    "@xcite find that the population of ysos in the gc cluster is extremely small .",
    "they conclude that it can not be a remnant of a massive star cluster , originated at several tens of parsecs away from sgr a * and then dynamically spiralled in , and is thus most likely formed _ in situ _ in a self - gravitating circum - nuclear disk and with a top heavy imf .",
    "while star formation around a super - massive black hole represents an extreme , it is clearly important to examine the imf of the  and  clusters in the general environment of the gc .",
    "we find a similar deficiency of ysos in  and  clusters , which places important constraints on their imf .",
    "existing near - ir studies have provided estimates on the present - day mf of stars with masses greater than a few solar masses in the core of the  cluster ; mf measurements in outer regions are difficult because of severe confusion with field stars .",
    "[ f : imf ] shows the mf within @xmath230 pc of the  cluster @xcite , compared with various predictions of ysos .",
    "the standard ms imf , normalized with the number of stars in the mass range of @xmath231 m@xmath232 , predicts at least 2@xmath233 ysos .",
    "using our measurements of the diffuse x - ray emission , we can directly get an upper limit to the population of ysos over the entire cluster ( @xmath234 pc ) .",
    "we assume that the mean x - ray luminosity of the ysos in the cluster to be the same as that in the orion nebula , because of their similar ages .",
    "as is shown above , much of the diffuse x - ray emission , though difficult to quantify , likely has other origins ( e.g. , cluster winds ) to account for the prominent iron k@xmath0 lines .",
    "therefore , the use of the total 2 - 8 kev diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath235 ( table  [ spec_d ] ) gives the upper limit as @xmath236 ysos , which is a factor of 10 smaller than the above prediction from the ms imf .",
    "the actual discrepancy should be substantially larger .",
    "we have neglected the mass loss in the stellar evolution , which is important for the massive stars .",
    "considering the mass loss , the number of stars in the above initial mass range , hence the normalization of the imf , would be greater .",
    "the number of cluster stars in the region of @xmath237 pc is also not included , though difficult to fully quantify ; for example , there are 77 stars with @xmath238 in the radius @xmath239 0.6 pc @xcite , compared to about 48 in the same mass range of the mf obtained by @xcite for @xmath239 0.4 pc .",
    "an extrapolation of a power law fit in the mass range of 6 - 60 m@xmath232 , as obtained by @xcite , is consistent with the x - ray - inferred number of ysos ( fig .",
    "[ f : imf ] ) .",
    "but , @xcite shows that the mf steepens with radius .",
    "this steepening is expected as a result of the dynamic mass segregation of stars in the cluster core @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mergers among stars may also be important in flattening the mf toward the cluster core .",
    "therefore , the mf of the entire cluster , including the region in @xmath240 pc , is likely to be steeper .",
    "if this is the case , a turnover in the mf ( e.g. , at @xmath241 m@xmath242 , as indicated in the study of @xcite , may indeed be required to explain the x - ray - inferred upper limit on the overall yso population in the  cluster .",
    "similarly , we can constrain the yso population in the cluster .",
    "there are 30 stars with masses larger than 20 @xmath243 within @xmath244@xmath28  ( 1 pc ) of the  cluster @xcite . assuming the ms imf would predict a total number of ysos to be at least @xmath245 .",
    "these ysos would have a 2 - 8 kev luminosity of @xmath246 , accounting for the weak dependence of the mean x - ray luminosity on the cluster age ( a factor of 1.6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this predicted value is a factor of 5 greater than our measured total diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath247 within @xmath248 of the 2  cluster (   [ sss : dif_a ] ) .",
    "we have presented a deep  acis - i observation of the  and  clusters .",
    "this observation , complemented by a high - resolution ovro mapping of a cs cloud accompanied with the  cluster , allows for an in - depth study of the high - energy phenomena and processes in these two clusters and their interplay with the gc environment .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows :    * point - like x - ray sources in the  observation are detected down to a detection limit of @xmath249 in the 1 - 9 kev band .",
    "this list should contain all significant massive colliding wind binaries in the acis - i field .",
    "the superb  positioning of these sources allow for identifications of multi - wavelength counterparts .",
    "we consider those sources best - detected in the 1 - 9 kev band to be likely located in the gc , whereas those sources preferentially detected in the 1 - 4 kev or 4 - 9 kev band are good candidates for foreground stars or extragalactic agns .",
    "in particular , we estimate that the agn contribution is on the order of only a few % of all our detected x - ray sources .",
    "* the x - ray source number - flux relation of the  and  cluster region can be characterized by a power law @xmath250 , where @xmath86 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 , equivalent to @xmath253@xmath254 , in the 0.5 - 8 kev band .",
    "this relation is significantly flatter than those determined in other regions of the gc @xcite , apparently due to the presence of a massive star - related population of relatively bright x - ray sources . *",
    "the three bright point - like x - ray sources in the core of the arches cluster show remarkably similar spectra , which can all be characterized by an optically - thin thermal plasma with a temperature of @xmath255 kev , a metal abundance of @xmath256 solar , and a foreground absorption of 7.7@xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "the 0.3 - 8 kev luminosities of the sources are in the range of @xmath257 @xmath145 .",
    "the sources have near - ir counterparts as late - type wn stars , which tend to have massive and fast stellar winds .",
    "therefore , the sources likely represent the extreme examples of colliding stellar wind binaries . the measured super - solar metal ( iron )",
    "abundance is consistent with other x - ray measurements of thermal hot plasma in the gc environment . *",
    "the x - ray sources in the core of the older and looser cluster are substantially dimmer and show more diverse spectral characteristics .",
    "qx1 , with a soft spectrum , is clearly a foreground star , whereas qx4 , with a very hard x - ray spectrum , but without a near - ir counterpart , could be either a background agn or a strongly obscured stellar object .",
    "the remaining two ( qx2 and qx3 ) are probably colliding wind binary systems , albeit less energetic than those in the  cluster .",
    "the pistol star , despite of its enormous bolometric luminosity , is not detected with a 3@xmath16 upper limit to the 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity as 3@xmath258 @xmath145 , consistent with the norminal relation @xmath180 .",
    "* diffuse x - ray emission from both  and  clusters are unambiguously detected .",
    "the emission is substantially more extended than the stellar distributions .",
    "the emission in the core region of  ( @xmath259 pc ) has a 2 - 8 kev luminosity of @xmath260 , a steep radial intensity decline , and a hard spectrum with a strong highly - ionized fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "these properties are consistent with the cluster wind interpretation . * the diffuse x - ray emission outside the  core , however , has a relatively flat and non - axis - symmetric spatial distribution .",
    "the spectrum of the emission shows a distinct 6.4-kev line with an ew of @xmath1 kev .",
    "this line can not be explained by the fluorescence of the  cluster x - ray emission and is probably due to the collision of low - energy cosmic - ray electrons with neutral or weakly ionized irons in a bow shock , which results from the supersonic motion of the cluster relative to the cs cloud . *",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from the  cluster ( @xmath261 ) is about a factor of 10 lower than from the  cluster and can be naturally explained by the cluster wind and a limited number of low - mass pre - main sequence ysos .",
    "* there appears to be a general deficiency of ysos in the two clusters , relative to the prediction from the standard miller & scalo imf . compared with the x - ray emission from young stars in the orion nebula , our observed total diffuse x - ray luminosities from the arches and quintuplet clusters suggest that they contain no more than @xmath262 and @xmath263 ysos .",
    "these numbers are a factor of 10 and 5 smaller than what would be expected from the imf and the massive star popluations observed in the cores of the two clusters .",
    "one possibility is that the imf indeed flattens at intermediate masses , as indicated in a near - ir study of the inner regions of the   cluster @xcite . *",
    "the cs molecular cloud appears to be colliding with the  cluster at a relative velocity of @xmath264 , explaining the bow shock morphology of the associated diffuse x - ray emission and its weak correlation with the cs ( j = 21 ) line intensity as well as the near - ir extinction distribution and possibly the abnormal kinematics of the dusty gas in the field .",
    "such collisions may be responsible for removing the natal clouds of the clusters at their early ages .",
    "high - velocity cloud - cloud collisions might also initiate the formation of massive stellar clusters , such as the  and 2 , with top - heavy imfs .",
    "these are the effects unique in the galactic nuclear environment .",
    "we thank d. figer for sending us near - ir data for comparison and for useful discussion on the arches cluster , a. stolte for her comments on the mf determination , and the anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions .",
