    "doped two - dimensional antiferromagnets have attracted considerable attention in the past two decades , due to their relevance as a model to describe high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite in addition to superconductivity , there have been many other phases observed in the cuprates , and there has been particular recent interest in the spin glass observed at low temperatures and intermediate doping,@xcite and the checkerboard ordered electronic state in the high - t@xmath0 cuprate bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) and in hole - doped copper oxides.@xcite whilst quantum effects are very important in the cuprates , it is also of interest to study whether glassy phases and slow dynamics are present in simple _ classical _ doped two dimensional antiferromagnets , and this is the subject we address here .    in this paper",
    "we construct the simplest such model that we can find that displays glassy dynamics - it has nearest neighbour interactions only and the spins are on a square lattice , so there is no geometric frustration .",
    "the only source of frustration is that there are mobile holes , and these mean that local relaxation to nel order leads to local frustration .",
    "whilst the model we construct is principally that of an antiferromagnet , it falls within the general class of models which show slow dynamics without quenched disorder .",
    "there has been intense activity in the past few years investigating models with this behaviour , especially kinetically constrained models , which have trivial hamiltonians but more complicated rules governing their dynamics.@xcite these models have been investigated with the aim of shedding light on the local structure of slow dynamics in glasses , dynamical heterogeneities.@xcite the approach here is complementary to the work on kinetically constrained models , as we study a model which has a more complicated hamiltonian , but relatively simple dynamics . the model we study also has some similarities to frustrated lattice gases@xcite and the hard square lattice gas.@xcite    we find that this model displays slow dynamics at low temperatures , both in the diffusion of particles and in the relaxation of spins . for the values of the parameters used ( temperature , doping and ratio between the antiferromagnetic and nearest - neighbour repulsion ) and the linear sizes analyzed the system reaches a stationary state after a transient .",
    "this state is characterized by antiferromagnetic or checkerboard order . in the stationary state",
    "we find unusual temperature dependence of the relaxation times for both diffusion and spin relaxation , that can be fit by a sub - arrhenius temperature dependence over the entire temperature range that we study ( although there is arrhenius temperature dependence at low temperatures ) .",
    "we also find evidence of spatially heterogeneous dynamics that lead to a breakdown of the relation between diffusive and rotational motion dictated by the debye - stokes - einstein law ( where we consider the spin degree of freedom to model rotations ) .",
    "the distributions of local correlations measured at different time differences are stationary , and hence trivially scale with the value of the global correlation.@xcite the _ form _ of these distributions is interesting in that they suggest that for spatial correlations there are two populations of sites , one with fast , and the other with slow dynamics , and a wide range of spin relaxation times .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model that we study and the one - time and two - time quantities that we calculate with monte carlo simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we display our results for the phase diagram and the correlation functions that we defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] .",
    "we show evidence of time - scales that diverge at low temperatures , and find that both the diffusive motion and spin flip dynamics are spatially heterogeneous .",
    "we also investigate the distributions of local two - time quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : se ] , we discuss how our results indicate a breakdown in the debye - stokes - einstein relation . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the hamiltonian for the model is @xmath3 where @xmath4 0 , 1 is a density variable indicating occupation of a site , and @xmath5 is an ising spin attached to each particle ( i.e. when a particle moves site , so does its spin ) . there is a nearest neighbour repulsion with magnitude @xmath6 , and a nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction with magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "the particles have a hard - core constraint so that there is no double occupancy of sites .",
    "we are interested in the limit where @xmath8 ( in the limit where @xmath9 , we find phase segregation of antiferromagnetic domains and regions with no particles ) .",
    "we study this model in the canonical ensemble by fixing the number of particles on a two dimensional square lattice and define the hole concentration @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of particles and @xmath12 is the lattice size .",
    "this is essentially the classical , ising limit of the @xmath13 model studied by kivelson and emery and co - workers.@xcite    we note that the model has some similarities to others that have been introduced in the literature , in particular the frustrated lattice gas,@xcite although in that case , the spin interactions @xmath14 are randomly drawn from a distribution , rather than being of constant sign and magnitude . in the limit that @xmath15 , this model has some resemblance to the hard square lattice gas @xcite ( although the spin degree of freedom means that the dynamics here have a different flavour to that model ) .    when there is no doping , the ground state is an antiferromagnet with nel order .",
    "this implies that the system can be divided into two sublattices , each with ferromagnetic order , shifted by one lattice spacing in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions with respect to each other . in this limit",
    ", the model can be made equivalent to a ferromagnet by applying a spin - flip transformation on one sublattice .",
    "however , once there is doping and holes are free to move around , the transformation is no longer applicable and the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet are distinct .",
    "we simulate this model using classical monte carlo simulations and metropolis dynamics .",
    "the model has no intrinsic dynamics , hence we impose the following dynamics . at each step",
    "we choose with 50 % probability either to attempt to move a particle to one of its neighbouring sites or to flip its spin.@xcite we only allow attempts to move a particle to an unoccupied site ( with equal probabilities for the unoccupied sites).@xcite the attempt is then accepted with boltzmann probability . in each of the particle move and spin flip steps , detailed balance is respected .",
    "the monte carlo time - unit is equal to the attempt of @xmath11 updates ( motion of particles or spin flips ) .",
    "whilst naively it might be thought that an individual hole would be localized due to leaving a string of overturned spins behind it , holes are able to move diagonally in an antiferromagnetic background at no energy cost by hopping around one and a half loops of a plaquette.@xcite the energy of the final state is the same as that of the initial state , however this is an activated process with activation energy @xmath18,@xcite as the hole flips spins into an unfavourable energy configuration on its first lap of the plaquette then lowers the energy to that of the original state as it goes round for another half a lap .",
    "similarly , a pair of holes that are on opposite corners of a plaquette can move along the diagonal that they lie on , although the activation for this process can involve @xmath6 as well as @xmath7 . at low doping , where holes interact very rarely , this implies that there are a lot of states with the same energy , yet with large barriers between them , which naturally leads to slow dynamics .",
    "we calculate quantities that should demonstrate spin and hole ordering and illustrate the dynamics of the spins and holes .",
    "the one - time quantities that indicate ordering are the staggered magnetization that indicates nel order of the spins and a checkerboard order parameter that indicates ordering of the holes .",
    "as has been discussed extensively in the literature ( see e.g. refs .  ) , glassy dynamics are often seen more easily in two - time quantities if one - time quantities reach a limit . in most of the cases",
    "we consider the one - time quantities saturate for high temperatures , but can saturate quite slowly as the temperature is decreased .",
    "we calculate the two - time correlations for spins and mean square displacement for both high and low temperatures .",
    "we calculate two one - time quantities .",
    "these are the staggered magnetization    @xmath19    and a checkerboard order parameter    @xmath20    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the co - ordinates of a given lattice site and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the spin and occupation of the site @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we calculate these quantities as a function of temperature to determine the phase diagram , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "we calculate several two - time correlation functions , for both spatial and spin correlations .",
    "these are : the mean square displacement @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the position of the @xmath26 particle ; a spin auto - correlation function @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spin of the @xmath26 particle ; and a constant - site spin correlation function @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the spin at site @xmath31 , and we note that @xmath30 may not be the same spin at times @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( although at low enough temperatures they coincide unless @xmath32 and @xmath33 are very widely spaced ) .",
    "we expect the long time limits of @xmath34 and @xmath35 to have different behaviour if there is nel order present in the system . as @xmath36",
    ", we expect @xmath37 , whereas @xmath38.@xcite the arguments for each of these limits are as follows .",
    "if there is neel order , then the lattice can be divided into two sublattices , each of which has an opposite spin orientation .",
    "consider the spins on one sublattice , at long times @xmath32 , diffusion will mean that half are on the other sublattice , and will have their spin flipped relative to its orientation at time @xmath33 .",
    "the contributions of the set of spins on the two sublattices to @xmath34 will have opposite signs and equal magnitude and hence we expect @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , if we consider the same - site correlation , then if there is no flipping of the antiferromagnetic order , @xmath35 should decay to @xmath39 reflecting the average value of the staggered magnetization on the site at the two times .",
    "we mainly focus on @xmath34 but show that @xmath40 has qualitatively similar time dependence to @xmath34 .",
    "in all our runs we used random initial conditions .",
    "most of the data presented are for @xmath41 though we also used larger systems @xmath42 , and 50 , to determine the phase diagram .",
    "we set @xmath43 unless otherwise specified . in our calculations",
    "we mainly use a waiting time of @xmath44 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) ( we found that we had essentially identical results for a shorter waiting time of @xmath45 mcs , and a longer waiting time of @xmath46 32000 mcs ) .",
    "we accumulated data for up to @xmath47 mcs after the waiting time .",
    "we first display results for one - time quantities which demonstrate that these saturate relatively quickly at high temperatures , but the saturation can be quite slow as the temperature is lowered at low values of @xmath16 .",

    "figure  [ fig : check ] shows the configuration reached by a low temperature sample at the same doping level after 25600 mcs .",
    "the results in the two figures appear to be consistent with the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and checkerboard order at low temperatures ( the non - zero value of @xmath51 at @xmath53 in fig .",

    "[ fig : check ] appears consistent with the possibility of phase separation .",

    "the boundary of the region of nel order , the nel temperature , @xmath56 , is found by calculating @xmath51 at @xmath41 , 40 , and 50 and extrapolating to where @xmath51 vanishes .",

    "we note that there is some waiting time dependence of the results at low temperatures , although this is generally only for very short waiting times ( @xmath79 mcs ) .",

    "the model studied here has several features that are reminiscent of a glass - forming liquid . at high temperatures , the mean - square displacements are linear in @xmath32 , showing diffusive behaviour , and the relaxation times associated with this diffusion grow very quickly with decreasing temperature .",
    "these diffusive properties are what one would expect for a liquid of hard - core particles , and what we study is essentially a lattice model of this type of system .",

    "[ fig : taucomp ] we plot the temperature dependence of the product of the translational diffusion coefficient and the characteristic time for relaxation of the spin correlation for five different values of @xmath16 .",
    "we find that that there is strong @xmath16 dependence of the ratio @xmath147 at low temperatures : for small @xmath16 , where there is no checkerboard ordering , @xmath148 grows at low temperatures , whereas the opposite is true for @xmath63 , where checkerboard ordering is present .",
    "the violation of the dse relation that we see is much smaller in magnitude than is generally seen in experiments , but this is likely to be because the model we investigate displays strong glassy behaviour , whereas experiments that study the breakdown of the se and dse relations are usually for fragile glass formers .",
    "the existence of an extra parameter , the doping @xmath16 , also allows for a richer set of behaviour of @xmath144 as a function of temperature than is present in supercooled liquids .",
    "we have studied a classical model for a doped antiferromagnet and found signatures of slow and heterogeneous dynamics . at low temperatures",
    "there is anomalous diffusion at lengthscales less than @xmath149 and stretched exponential spin relaxations .",
    "we characterize the temperature below which the slow spin relaxations occur as @xmath61 . for the doping levels we considered @xmath61 is less than the higher of the nel temperature @xmath56 and the temperature @xmath60 , below which checkerboard order is observed .",
    "the timescales associated with both diffusion and spin relaxation diverge at low temperatures in an arrhenius fashion , at all doping levels considered , behaviour reminiscent of a strong glass former .",
    "interestingly , we found that we were able to fit the temperature dependence over the entire temperature range with a sub - arrhenius form for both @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "when we investigated the changes in spin configurations between two different times at several different doping levels , we found that at low temperatures , the dynamics were spatially heterogeneous , with regions of high and low mobility  we also found that spin flips were most likely to occur adjacent to regions of high mobility .",
    "this spatially heterogeneous dynamics also manifests itself in the distributions of local diffusion and spin relaxation .",
    "the distributions of local square displacements indicate that there are _ fast _ and _ slow _ populations of particles , corresponding respectively , to those which have escaped , and those which are trapped in cages with size of order @xmath99 .",
    "the distributions of local spin correlations also indicate that there are fast and slow sites , through the wide range of relaxation times implied by the distribution .",
    "finally , we found that when we compare @xmath85 and @xmath84 there are violations of the debye - stokes - einstein relation that vary as a function of doping .    on a first glance at eq .",
    "( [ eq : modeldef ] ) it might appear strange that there are slow dynamics associated with this model . there is no quenched disorder , and there is no explicit frustration in the interactions as one might expect to see in a glassy model .",
    "the frustration that leads to slow dynamics appears to be hidden in the interplay of antiferromagnetic interactions and the restrictions on particle motion imposed by the level of doping .",
    "the clearest example of this is the large energy barrier to the motion of a hole to the opposite side of a plaquette .",
    "one way to relate this model to others that have been studied previously is to think about integrating out the holes , which generates a spin model with plaquette interactions , which is a generalized version of the gonihedral models that have been studied and found to have suggestions of metastable states and glassy dynamics.@xcite    whilst we believe that the study of the model in this paper is of interest in itself , we also note that there is a famous class of doped two dimensional antiferromagnets , namely the high @xmath150 superconducting cuprates to which this work may have some connections .",
    "there are some very clear differences between our model and generic models for these materials , specifically that it is classical rather than quantum ( and hence can not show superconductivity ) , and also has ising spins rather than heisenberg spins , leading to an enhancement of long - range order in two dimensions .",
    "however , the existence of glassy spin and diffusive dynamics , in the absence of quenched disorder , along with checkerboard order , even in a classical model is very interesting .",
    "it also suggests that it might be interesting to compare quantities analogous to the se and dse relations for spin and charge relaxations in cuprates .",
    "we intend to investigate this model with quantum dynamics in future work .",
    "this will hopefully complement understanding gained in studying spin dynamics in doped two dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with quenched disorder.@xcite    the model displays many of the features that one would expect in a lattice model for a structural glass ( if one imagines the spin as corresponding to an orientation for a rod - like molecule ) . the temperature dependence of the relaxation times at low temperatures is consistent with that of a strong glass - former , although it is interesting that the temperature dependence over the entire temperature range can be fit with a sub - arrhenius dependence . it",
    "maybe that dimensionality plays some role in the behaviour that we observe  it would be interesting to study this model in three dimensions to see whether similar behaviour is evident there .",
    "we note that recent experiments on two dimensional glassy films do show relaxation times that appear to have sub - arrhenius behaviour if one fits over a temperature range that straddles @xmath146 .",
    "@xcite    another direction of research that we believe may be fruitful is , having established the existence of slow dynamics in this model to construct a field theoretic description , and to compare whether the symmetries found in the case of quenched disorder in the edwards - anderson model @xcite are present , and what differences exist between the two cases .",
