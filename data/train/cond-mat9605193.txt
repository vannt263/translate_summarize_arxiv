    "an increasing complexity in the structure of the order parameter of the high @xmath3 superconductors is coming out from the experiments .",

    "a very small value of the gap is measured along the @xmath4 direction ( @xmath5 ) compatible with a line of nodes according to the @xmath1-wave pairing @xcite .",
    "evidence for @xmath1-wave pairing comes also from penetration depth measurements and from several josephson - coupling experiments mostly in ybco @xcite .",
    "phase sensitive experiments , however , in some cases also provide evidence for the @xmath2-wave pairing @xcite .",
    "the actual situation seems therefore to be more complex than the one associated to a specific pairing of a given symmetry . even though the present experimental situation is still uncertain it is worth considering the implications as well as the various possible origins of superconducting order parameters of different symmetries .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the symmetry ( @xmath1-wave vs @xmath2-wave ) and the doping dependence of the critical temperature @xmath3 for the pairing interactions which arise near a charge instability .",
    "specifically , we will show that a @xmath1-wave pairing comes out in a region of the phase diagram near a phase - separation ( ps ) or an incommensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) instability .",
    "the latter situation arises in strongly correlated systems when coulomb forces forbid a thermodynamic ps giving rise to a density instability at a specific finite wave vector @xmath6 . in a recent letter",
    "it was shown that near these charge instabilities a singular scattering among quasiparticles arises which may be responsible for the anomalous behavior of the normal phase above @xmath3 @xcite . according to our analysis",
    ", the same singular scattering may provide the strong pairing mechanism needed for high @xmath3 cuprate superconductors .",
    "the order parameter turns out to be strongly anisotropic and , under quite general conditions , of @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "this happens in the proximity of both ps and cdw .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the cdw case reveals an interesting interplay between the finite - momentum instability and the geometry of the fermi surface leading to the appearence of specific structures in the superconducting gap . finally , by considering the ps and the cdw instabilities at zero temperature within the context of quantum transitions , we will argue on a possible mechanism for the existence of both strong variations and plateaus in the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on doping .",
    "the origin of @xmath1-wave pairing is usually attributed to the relevance of electron - electron ( @xmath7 ) scattering at large wave vector , specifically at @xmath8 due to strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , charge fluctuations near a ps ( in particular driven by excitonic effects in a three - band extended hubbard model ) have already been proposed as a source of @xmath1-wave pairing @xcite . here",
    "we shall exploit the general feature that an effective interaction with on site repulsion and singular attraction @xcite at small @xmath0 is generated nearby a ps , regardless of the forces driving the instability @xcite .",
    "an effective @xmath7 interaction with attraction at small @xmath0 and weak on site repulsion was already advocated to explain the strong anisotropy in the gap observed in @xmath9 experiments @xcite . in these analyses",
    "the anisotropy of the gap ( of @xmath2-wave symmetry ) is driven by the anisotropy of the density of states due to momentum decoupling induced by the small @xmath0 scattering , which for a given point @xmath10 in momentum space couples only nearby states .",
    "later the analysis was extended by considering @xmath1-wave pairing which indeed turns out to be favored when the local repulsion is sizable @xcite .",
    "our following analysis of the symmetry of the order parameter in a two - dimensional system near a ps shares many features with the analysis of ref.@xcite , eventhough the model considered in ref.@xcite assumes that the small-@xmath0 attraction is of pure phononic origin with no connection with ps @xcite .    in the proximity of ps",
    "the effective interaction has a rich dynamical structure which is relevant for the anomalous behavior above @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "concerning the superconducting properties we limit ourselves to consider the static part of this effective interaction which has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath11    where @xmath12 is the cutoff of the attractive interaction , @xmath13 the attraction strenght in unity of the inverse square of the lattice constant and @xmath14 is an on site effective repulsion @xcite ; we impose to the interaction the periodicity of the lattice without modifing the behaviour at small @xmath0 by writing @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "near ps @xmath17 vanishes as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the doping ( with respect to half filling ) and @xmath20 is the critical doping at which the instability for ps occurs . at @xmath20",
    "the value @xmath13 stays finite and a singular effective attraction at small @xmath0 arises .    to study the symmetry of the superconducting gap we solve a simple @xmath21 self - consistent equation for the gap parameter @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 given in eq.([veff ] ) .",
    "later we shall use a different effective potential ( @xmath25 , see following eq.([veffw ] ) ) to analyse the gap in the proximity of a cdw .",
    "of course , approaching @xmath26 the superconducting properties obtained within the @xmath21 theory should only be considered on a qualitative ground .",
    "for instance , wave function corrections become relevant .",
    "( the same comment would apply for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the critical doping for the cdw instability ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that vertex corrections could partially compensate wave function corrections due to small-@xmath0 scattering similarly to what happens in one dimension @xcite , or near one dimension @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation has indeed shown that the superconducting critical temperature is enhanced by considering the vertex corrections to migdal - eliashberg theory in a model with small-@xmath0 coupling to optical phonons @xcite .    in eq.([bcst ] ) the sum over @xmath29 is done over the first brillouin zone , @xmath30 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the electronic dispersion measured with respect to the fermi energy @xmath33 .",
    "we consider a tight - binding model with hopping up to the fifth nearest neighbors @xmath34 where , according to ref .",

    "these parameters are appropriate for the band structure of the biscco compounds , thus giving an open fermi surface and a van hove singularity ( vhs ) slightly below the fermi level ( for electrons ) .",
    "the value of @xmath47ev is fixed to get the proper distance of the fermi surface from the vhs ( @xmath48mev as determined experimentally ) , and corresponds to ( optimal ) doping @xmath49 .",
    "the full bandwidth @xmath50 is @xmath51ev .",
    "the choice of the parameters entering the effective interaction @xmath52 is to some extent arbitrary since they will depend on the specific mechanism driving ps .",
    "we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these values are of the order of magnitude of the estimates obtained for a single - band hubbard - holstein model near ps @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 equation ( [ bcst ] ) is solved in two limiting cases : @xmath55 ) at zero temperature , to obtain the ground state in the superconducting phase ; @xmath56)in the linearized form , for @xmath22 going to zero , to evaluate the critical temperature @xmath3 of the superconducting transition .",
    "we provide a numerical self - consistent solution of the @xmath21 equation on a lattice of @xmath57 points ( in each quadrant of the brillouin zone ) , taking advantage of the fast fourier transform @xcite . in the case of an undistorted tetragonal lattice ,",
    "both in the proximity to ps and to cdw , the solutions in the @xmath2-wave and @xmath1-wave channels are decoupled and the solution is a superposition of all harmonics of a given symmetry . in the range of parameters we have considered the @xmath2-wave solutions",
    "can be roughly approximated by a linear combination of the first square harmonics @xmath58 while the @xmath1-wave solutions are decoupled in the @xmath59-like and @xmath60-like harmonics @xmath61 in all cases we find that the @xmath60-like solution is strongly suppressed because it has a line of nodes along the relevant @xmath62 directions where saddle points are present at @xmath63 , @xmath64 , giving rise to van hove singularities in the density of states @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to analyse the gap parameter at @xmath65 in the proximity of ps .",
    "the solution is given for the same set of parameters at varius @xmath12 s . in fig .",
    "1a we show the momentum dependence of the @xmath2-wave solution on the fermi surface .",
    "we define an angular variable @xmath66 measured from the line @xmath67 to detect the points on the fermi surface as seen from the point @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath2-wave solution has two nodes in each quadrant , symmetrically located with respect to the @xmath4 direction ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whose positions depend on @xmath69 .",
    "the maximum value of the gap is in the @xmath62 directions , near the van hove singularities ( this is due to almost complete momentum decoupling at small @xmath0 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in fig .",
    "1b we show the same @xmath66-dependence for the @xmath59 solution .",
    "this solution has a line of nodes along the @xmath4 direction @xmath70 and the maximum value along @xmath62 directions .",
    "the maximum value of the gap parameter is much larger for the @xmath1-wave solution than for the @xmath2-wave solution and the relative difference is so neat that it is easy to predict also a large difference in the condensation energy .",
    "the comparison between @xmath2-wave and @xmath1-wave is completed evaluating the condensation energy per particle @xmath71 for the @xmath21 ground state . in fig.2",
    "we report the results for the two analysed symmetries and different @xmath12 .",
    "the difference between the two condensation energies is considerable , since we find @xmath72 for all considered @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    from the above analysis it is clear that the @xmath1-wave solution is the favorite gap parameter of the superconducting phase induced by the interaction ( [ veff ] ) characteristic of models that present a small - momentum charge instability .",
    "we would like to point out that this result is a consequence of three related but distinct features of the system : first there is a strongly @xmath0-dependent attraction peaked at small momenta .",
    "this leads to a momentum decoupling so that the _ modulus _ of the gap parameter tends to match the local density of states of the system .",
    "then a second feature needed to obtain a gap anisotropy is a largely anisotropic density of states , possibly with extended van hove singularities in some regions of the k - space .",
    "both these features , however , only point towards the setting in of an anisotropic order parameter , which still could well be of the @xmath2 type .",
    "it is the presence of a ( nearly ) momentum independent sizable repulsion which leads to @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "this solution is able to avoid the isotropic repulsive interaction @xmath14 since its average over the brillouin zone is zero while keeping the paired electrons in the attractive region of the effective potential .",
    "roughly , the @xmath1-wave becomes favorable when the average repulsion felt by the @xmath2-wave paired electrons exceeds the loss in condensation energy due to the vanishing of the order parameter along the nodal regions . among the @xmath1 waves ,",
    "the @xmath59 is preferred because the nodes occur where the modulus of the order parameter is anyway small ( i.e. , due to momentum decoupling , where the density of states is small ) .",
    "as extensively discussed in appendix a , by reducing the relative value of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath13 the @xmath2-wave solution may be recovered . at @xmath74",
    "we find that this happens for @xmath75 .",
    "we believe , however , that the presence of a sizable @xmath76 is an unavoidable feature of strongly correlated systems . in turn",
    "strong correlation is a prerequisite for the likely occurrence of a charge instability and for the related enhancement of the residual attraction among quasiparticles .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that pairing near ps in strongly correlated systems is of @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "the occurence of ps is a theoretical outcome of models with short - range forces . in a real charged system",
    "long - range forces prevent charge segregation on a macroscopic scale leaving open the way to charge segregation on a microscopic scale , i.e. to cdw @xcite . if and when cdw are realized is a debated issue . in the early stage of the investigation on this problem ,",
    "a charge - glass behavior was suggested as a result of frustated ps @xcite .",
    "recently , cdw have been observed in the related compound @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "superstructures are also seen in various cuprates @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether these experimental evidences can indeed be attribuited to the interplay between ps and long range coulomb forces .",
    "here we assume that the system is near a cdw instability characterized by an incommensurate wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "the value of this @xmath6 is mainly fixed by the balance between charge segregation favored by short range forces and the consequent electrostatic cost . to a large extent",
    ", @xmath6 is not a fermi surface property ( i.e. @xmath6 is not a nesting vector ) . in the analysis of the hubbard - holstein model @xmath6",
    "is found almost parallel to the @xmath78 directions ( similarly to the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite in the analysis of an effective ising model with long range forces ) .",
    "its value comes out to be of order one .    near the cdw instability and neglecting the dynamics relevant to the anomalous properties above @xmath3",
    ", the effective interaction among quasiparticles can be written as@xcite    @xmath79    where the sum is over the four equivalent vectors of the cdw instability @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this expression is used to reproduce the behavior @xmath82 for @xmath83 while mantaining the lattice periodicity .    as in eq.([veff ] ) , @xmath69 acts as a cutoff of the effective interaction .",
    "it can be identified with the inverse correlation length of the cdw and vanishes at @xmath84 .",
    "we take for u and v the same values used before @xcite and solve eq.([bcst ] ) with @xmath85 given in eq.([veffw ] ) .",
    "all the qualitative features presented above for the case of proximity to ps are not changed near the cdw instability if @xmath6 is small , specifically if it stays smaller than the momentum @xmath86 connecting the two branches of the fermi surface around the vhs . for the considered set of band parameters we find @xmath87 .",
    "we report in figs.3 , the values of the gap on the fermi surface as a function of the angle @xmath66 for @xmath88 both for @xmath2 and @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "[ fig3 ]    notice that for all @xmath89 the shape of the @xmath1-wave gap is not very different from a pure @xmath59 ( longdashed line in fig.3b ) .",
    "the situation would be different if we would consider a much smaller value for the attraction @xmath13 ( say @xmath90 ) , pushing the system in a weak coupling regime . in this case",
    "there is a tendency of the curve to become flat around @xmath91 analogously to the finding of ref.@xcite ( longdashed curve in fig.3b and even more evidently , for @xmath92ev in fig.1b )    for @xmath93 a new feature appears in @xmath94 .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , where we report the gap for various values of @xmath6 , by increasing @xmath6 extended flat regions develop around the maxima at @xmath95 , which eventually become local minima for the @xmath1-wave solution .",
    "this feature is very pronounced for small @xmath69 ( @xmath96 in fig.4 ) .",
    "[ fig4 ]    the reason is the interplay between the vhs , which mostly weight @xmath95 , and the value of @xmath6 which for @xmath93 only connects the two branches of the fermi surface around the vhs at finite values of @xmath66 resulting in maxima for @xmath94 near these values of @xmath66 .",
    "notice that these local maxima in the order parameter are much more pronounced in the @xmath2-wave ( fig.4a ) than in the @xmath1-wave channel ( fig.4b ) .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath2-wave order parameter they are also visible when @xmath97 provided the mass term @xmath98 is large enough ( @xmath99 ) . in this latter case , although the instability wavevector is not large enough to encompass two branches of the fermi surface , the attractive potential is broad and shallow enough to  put in touch \" substantial momentum regions on the different branches to build up an increased order parameter at finite values of @xmath66 away from @xmath95 .",
    "we also analyzed the case of a cdw instability along the ( 1,1 ) direction , without finding qualitative differences with respect to the ( 1,0 ) case .",
    "finally we considered an _ isotropic _ cdw instability . in this latter case the effective attraction is approximately given by @xmath100 then we write @xmath101 to guarantee the correct lattice periodicity , while keeping the presence of a line of @xmath0 points with large attraction .",
    "the result is given in fig.5 for the case of @xmath1-wave symmetry only and for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig5 ]    it is apparent that the feature of the local minima at @xmath95 is _ less _ pronounced since more @xmath102 are effective in connecting different points on the fermi surface .    to our knowledge there is no report in the literature of local minima for the gap at @xmath95 .",
    "this would imply that the @xmath6 invoked to describe cuprates has to be smaller than @xmath103 , or the instability should have an almost isotropic strucure .",
    "it is worth noting that in the hubbard - holstein model @xcite the effective attraction is indeed diverging in an anisotropic way at @xmath104 ; however it has a large value all over the region @xmath105 . in this case",
    "we get an intermediate behavior between the anisotropic and isotropic cdw .",
    "this case is also very dependent on the interaction couplings and we will not show the detailed results aiming to discuss the generic features of proximity to cdw .    in the above discussion of the behavior of the gap near cdw we have only partially commented on the @xmath2-wave solution which also presents rich structures depending on @xmath6 ( figs.3a and 4a ) .",
    "indeed we find that the stable solution at @xmath106 is @xmath1-wave even in the proximity to cdw similarly to the ps case , provided a sizable u ( @xmath107 , according to our choice ) is present .",
    "this can be inferred from the larger values of the maximum of the @xmath1-wave gap with respect to the @xmath2-wave gap .",
    "the explicit computation of the condensation energy confirms this expectation in all the considered cases . as an example , in fig.6 , we report @xmath108 for the set of parameters corresponding to fig.4 .",
    "[ fig6 ]    for completeness we have also carried out in appendix a a systematic analysis of the relative stability of @xmath2- versus @xmath1-wave solutions in order to find the influence of the various parameters ( mainly @xmath98 and @xmath6 ) in determining the symmetry of the gap function .",
    "the evaluation of a reliable superconducting critical temperature is the most difficult issue of a theory dealing with singular interactions like those generated nearby ps and cdw . in the present analysis",
    "we start by solving eq.([bcst ] ) in the linearized form in order to get @xmath3 vs @xmath98 in the proximity of ps or cdw ( depending on @xmath24 or @xmath85 ) .",
    "we report in fig.7 the evaluated critical temperature for the set of parameters discussed above and for different @xmath12 smaller than the fermi wave vector @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig7 ]    we have verified that the @xmath1-wave transition has always a substantially larger critical temperature than the @xmath2-wave ( not reported in fig.7 ) both in the proximity of ps and cdw . roughly , the maximum value of the bcs gap ( at @xmath106 ) gives the order of magnitude of the correponding @xmath3(@xmath110 ) .",
    "the curves show a strong dependence on @xmath98 , which at small @xmath98 assumes the form @xmath111 .",

    "the inclusion of the dynamical effects beyond bcs would cutoff the divergency of @xmath3 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath98 becomes a finite function of @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where @xmath1 is the dimension , @xmath117 is the dynamical critical index and @xmath118 is the index of the `` mass '' @xmath98 at @xmath106 , @xmath119 .",
    "this indicates that when ps or cdw occur at finite temperature , they will occur at @xmath120 .",

    "an additional parameter controlling the @xmath172-wave interplay is the size of the instability wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "its increasing to values of order @xmath173 makes the anisotropic density of states less relevant for establishing an anisotropic gap .",
    "this strongly depresses @xmath1-wave pairing which indeed disappears for large @xmath6 , while it affects less the @xmath2-wave solution .    in the context of the model interactions ( [ veff ] ) and ( [ veffw ] )",
    "@xmath2-wave pairing is `` easier '' in an electron doped system ( @xmath33 far away from vhs ) , specifically if the attraction is induced by the proximity to a cdw with a sizable @xmath6 .",
    "the recent experimental finding @xcite on the existence of @xmath2-wave pairing in overdoped biscco compound ( if confirmed ) is however not easily explained in the context of proximity to charge instabilities . in particular , by overdoping the system approaches the van hove singularity thus enhancing the anisotropy of the gap , which , in turn should favor the @xmath1-wave symmetry . to reconcile this finding with the scenario presented here , one could invoke a large reduction of u due to larger screening effects , a more three dimensional character of the system , or a change of size and direction of @xmath6 .",
    "disorder is an other relevant mechanism which affects the relative stability of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconducting phases : @xmath2-wave is more robust in this respect and large disorder could favor this latter symmetry with respect to @xmath1-wave .",
    "this issue was recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and was not of our concern in the present paper .    concerning the superconducting critical temperature @xmath3 ,",
    "we have seen that the most important parameter controlling its value is @xmath98 , even though the vhs produce a sizable enhancement , which however is effective in a too extended region of doping , as seen in fig.8 .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath98 reduces this region . within the range of parameters we have considered ( allowing for larger values of v within a factor 2 ) , @xmath174 ,",
    "is enough to get @xmath175 .",
    "these values of @xmath98 correspond to correlation lengths of the order of @xmath176 lattice constants . according to the discussion given in the previous section , the strong dependence on doping of @xmath98 induces a strongly dependent @xmath3 .",
    "the maximal @xmath3 is nearby the cdw instability for @xmath177 , with smaller values of @xmath123 favouring higher @xmath3 .",
    "then the maximum @xmath3 is not directly related to the proximity to a vhs .",
    "various factors affect the coefficient @xmath123 ( like the energy scale for the dynamical fluctuations near ps or cdw ) and its specific estimate depends on the specific model leading to charge instabilities . however , we gave arguments for the existence of a steep increase of @xmath3 with doping , just above the qcp for charge instability , followed by plateaus in this dependence and we provided rough estimates of this behavior .",
    "the ps and cdw scenarios have various analogies with the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation ( af ) scenario@xcite .",
    "indeed both approaches assume the proximity to a qcp .",
    "a main claim is that the af scenario is supported by a large number of experimental evidences , first of all the actual existence of a af transition .",
    "however , notice that the experimental @xmath178 is obtained at a doping far away from @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , two remarkable crossover lines can be identified in the phase diagram of the superconducting cuprates .",
    "the first one identifies the doping dependence of the maximum in the uniform magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the second one ( @xmath181 ) separates the quantum critical from the quantum disordered regimes @xcite .",
    "these two curves do not cross , but rather converge towards the same point [ figs . 2 and 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ] nearby the optimal doping .",
    "it is quite tempting to relate this remarkable point with the zero - temperature cdw quantum critical point .",
    "indeed , according to our analysis , this point sets up the region in doping of maximum attractive interaction and should be close to the optimally doped regime .    within this scheme ,",
    "the existence of ps or cdw ( once long - range forces are taken into account ) is not alternative to the existence of an af qcp and the two qcp control the behavior of the system at different doping .",
    "the cdw sets up the maximum critical temperature and can constitute the substrate to substain af fluctuations far away from the ordered phase , by allowing for hole - rich and hole - poor `` stripes '' .",
    "a constructive interplay between cdw and af was also suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite within the analysis of the t - j model .",
    "the criticism that the experimental j ( @xmath182 ) is lower than the value needed for ps ( @xmath183 ) @xcite can be overcome by considering additional sources for charge instabilities ( for instance , coupling to the lattice @xcite or charge - transfer excitons @xcite ) . with the assumption that the maximal @xmath3 is associated to the cdw quantum critical point",
    ", the quantum disorderd phase will correspond to the region between the af and the cdw quantum critical points .",
    "fig.9 represents this scenario in a schematic way .      according to the above scenario ,",
    "the occurrence in the phase diagram of the high temperature superconducting cuprates of both an af ( at low doping ) and a cdw ( at intermediate doping ) quantum critical point and the related existance of two correlation length , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , opens new possibilities for the interpretation of various effects related to the magnetic correlations like , e.g. , the presence of a spin gap at low and intermediate doping , the behavior of the spin - spin correlation length , the discrepancies existing between nmr and neutron scattering experiments @xcite . in particular , in the spin quantum disordered regime it is natural to infer the existance of a spin gap as a property of spin waves on finite domains of the order of @xmath184 , as also reported in ref.@xcite .    within the proposed scenario , owing to the crucial role played by cdw fluctuations in determining the physics of the superconducting cuprates ,",
    "it is naturally quite relevant whether or not an incommensurate cdw symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "on the other hand the quasi twodimensional character of the cuprates could play a role in ( partially or totally ) suppressing the critical temperature for the establishing of a static incommensurate long - range cdw order for which a two - component order parameter is required .",
    "indications in this sense are also provided by a recent work @xcite , where the angle - resolved photoemission and optical conductivity properties of a model with long - range incommensurate cdw order were investigated . a better agreement with the observed spectra , was found whenever the long - range order was eliminated by the ( static ) superposition of different cdw configurations thus mimicking a phase with cdw fluctuations without long - range order either due to thermal fluctuations or to disorder .",
    "this finding suggests that the low dimensionality prevents the establishing in the cuprates of incommensurate long - range cdw order on a macroscopic scale leaving the possibility of static order on a mesoscopic scale only or slow dynamical fluctuations .",
    "this locally ( in space and/or time ) `` ordered '' phase should then be identified with the magnetic quantum disordered region below @xmath186 .",
    "a true cdw order can occur when a suitable matching between the underlying lattice and the charge fluctuations produces commensurability conditions and a consequent pinning .",
    "it was recently proposed @xcite that such an occurrence takes place in @xmath77 at 1/8 doping .",
    "remarkably , in this systems , the pinned charge order and the consequent insulating behavior takes place before a long - range af order is established @xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that the freezing of charge fluctuations is responsible for the insulating behavior rather than the magnetic ordering . of course",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of magnetic interactions being ( co-)responsible for the charge instability , the origin of which ( magnetic , excitonic , phononic or a combination of these mechanisms ) is still an open issue .",
    "the scenario proposed in this paper relates ( @xmath1-wave ) superconductivity and anomalous normal state behavior @xcite to the proximity to a charge instability .",
    "this mechanism is quite general and is likely expected to work in other systems than the high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "a superconducting phase close to both incommensurate sdw @xcite and cdw @xcite phases occur in some nearly onedimensional systems , thus suggesting also in this case a relation between superconductivity and an incommensurate instability .",
    "finally we like to mention that superconductivity at a fairly large critical temperature ( @xmath187k ) occurs in @xmath188 systems close to a cdw phase . this phase at low potassium doping is commensurate and responsible for the insulating behavior of the system .",
    "however , by increasing the doping the system becomes metallic and superconducting .",
    "interestingly enough , optical experiments @xcite show that the feature in the optical conductivity related to the cdw gap in the insulating phase smoothly and continuously shifts at lower frequencies upon doping and persist in the mid - infrared region in the metallic phase , where it coexists with the drude contribution .",
    "it is obviously quite tempting to interpret these results as an indication of persistance of cdw incommensurate fluctuations in the metallic phase .",
    "if this were the case , the scenario proposed here could be of relevance for these systems as well .      as mentioned in sects .",
    "ii and iii , a crucial role in the relative stability of the @xmath1-wave vs anisotropic @xmath2-wave superconducting phases is played by the local residual repulsion between the quasiparticles @xmath14 . in particular , for a given parameter set ( @xmath13 , @xmath69 , @xmath6 ) it is possible to find a critical @xmath189 above which @xmath2-wave superconductivity becomes unstable with respect to the @xmath1-wave phase .",
    "this quantity is therefore directly related to and provides information on the relative robustness of the two superconducting phases : the larger @xmath189 is and the more difficult it is to spoil @xmath2-wave superconductivity . in order to filter this information from the absolute strength of superconductivity for a given parameter set , we normalize the @xmath189 with @xmath190 , the average value ( on the brillouin zone ) of the attractive part of the effective potentials in eqs . ( [ veff ] ) and ( [ veffw ] ) .",
    "we carried out an analysis of the normalized critical local repulsion @xmath191 as a function of the mass parameter @xmath98 for the ps instability , and as a function of the wavelength for the cdw instabilities with wavevectors in the ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) directions and for the isotropic cdw .",
    "table i displays the results of this analysis .",
    "two clear tendencies are found .",
    "first of all the @xmath2-wave solution is made more stable ( @xmath192 increases ) by increasing the @xmath98 .",
    "this is because in this way the effective potential becomes less sharply structured in momentum space , the attractive well being more shallow . as a consequence ,",
    "the superconducting gap anisotropy is less pronounced ( there is a weaker momentum decoupling ) making in turn comparatively less favorable to create a line of nodes in the order parameter to produce @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "the second clear tendency is the increase of @xmath191 by increasing the momentum of the cdw instability .",
    "increasing @xmath193 favors the coupling of momenta , which are rather distant from each other , thus reducing the effect of the anisotropic density of states .",
    "consequently , the gap anisotropy is smeared and also in this case the lines of nodes of the @xmath1-wave solution are made comparatively less favorable .",
    "notice also that this latter effect is more pronounced for the instability in the ( 1,1 ) direction because the phase of the order parameter in the @xmath1-wave superconductivity is hardly compatible with an attractive potential strongly scattering states close to the @xmath194-@xmath195 points of the brillouin zone @xcite .    we finally like to point out that fixing @xmath190 in order to obtain ( for the pure @xmath1-wave ) a critical temperature around 100k , in all cases @xmath189 turns out to be quite small ( a few hundreds of ev ) .",
    ".dependence of the normalized critical @xmath189 on the mass parameter @xmath69 close to a ps and on the modulus of the instability wavevector close to the cdw instability ( for @xmath196 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     z .- x .",
