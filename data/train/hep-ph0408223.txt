    "the phase transition from partonic degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) to interacting hadrons is a central topic of modern high  energy physics . in order to understand the dynamics and relevant scales of this transition  as well the dynamical formation of hadrons  laboratory experiments",
    "are presently performed with ultra  relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "estimates based on the bjorken formula @xcite and/or calculations within hadron - string - dynamical transport approaches @xcite indicate that the critical energy density for the formation of a quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) of 0.7 to 1 gev/@xmath4 @xcite should by far be exceeded in the initial phase of central au+au collisions for a couple of @xmath5 at top sps and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "however , the task still remains to unambiguously identify the formation and properties of this new phase .",
    "whereas there are a couple of tentative signatures for an early partonic phase such as the high transverse pressure seen experimentally @xcite as well as the large elliptic flow of hadrons at moderate and high momenta @xcite , a unique smoking gun could not be identified so far . in order to find representative signatures one has to look for early hard probes that dominantly test the first few fm / c of the relativistic heavy - ion collision . hence",
    ", the measurements of hard jets should offer a direct access to the dynamics in the early stage when the ( possibly deconfined ) matter is very dense .",
    "in fact , the phenix @xcite and star @xcite collaborations have reported a large relative suppression of hadron spectra for transverse momenta @xmath0 above @xmath6 which might point towards the creation of a qgp , since this suppression is not observed in d+au interactions at the same bombarding energy per nucleon @xcite and thus has to be attributed to final state interactions .",
    "furthermore , an almost complete suppression of far - side jets has been reported for central au+au collisions @xcite which is also not seen in d+au reactions @xcite .",
    "these observations  at first sight  appear to be compatible with the picture of partonic energy loss in a dense colored medium @xcite , however , it is not clear presently to which extent these suppression phenomena might be due to ordinary hadronic final - state - interactions ( fsi ) @xcite since ( in-)elastic collisions of ( pre-)hadronic high momentum states with the bulk of hadrons in the late fireball might also contribute significantly to the attenuation of the high transverse momentum hadrons at rhic @xcite .",
    "hence , the hadronic attenuation has to be addressed in more detail before conclusions on perturbative qcd effects in a deconfined qgp phase on the materializing jets can be drawn .",
    "in fact , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite a major fraction of the high @xmath0 hadron attenuation in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev can be described by the ( dominantly ) inelastic interactions of leading pre - hadrons .    in order to specify the latter findings in refs .",
    "@xcite we briefly recall the concept of leading ( pre - hadronic ) and secondary ( ordinary ) hadrons in the string - hadron transport approach : in a high energy nucleon - nucleon collision two ( or more ) color - neutral strings are assumed to be formed ; the string ends are defined by the space - time coordinates of the constituents which are denoted as leading quarks . the latter are initially colored but assumed to pick up almost instantly a quark ( or antiqiuark ) from the vacuum to build up color neutral leading pre - hadrons @xcite .",
    "these pre - hadronic states are distinguished from secondary hadrons that arise from the further fragmentation of the strings and consist solely of quarks and antiquarks ( diquarks and antidiquarks ) created from the vacuum at some later time .",
    "the total time that is needed for the fragmentation of the strings and for the hadronization of the fragments is denoted as _ formation time _ and taken as @xmath7 fm in the hsd transport approach . due to time dilatation",
    "the formation time @xmath8 in any reference frame is then proportional to the lorentz @xmath9-factor , @xmath10 we stress that the formation time is a sensible parameter and has been fixed in @xcite by the rapidity distribution of charged particles at sps energies in the range 0.60.8 fm / c .",
    "though @xmath11 is no longer a free parameter we will perform also calculations for the jet suppression in section 4 for different @xmath11 ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 fm / c . in principle , other scenarios for modeling the string fragmentation might also be investigated , e.g. formation times depending explicitly on the hadron species or those extracted from the lund fragmentation scheme ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , we here constrain to the simple model introduced in ref . @xcite and delay an investigation of alternative prescriptions to future studies .    in the hsd transport approach , furthermore , it is assumed that hadrons , whose constituent quarks and antiquarks are created from the vacuum in the string fragmentation , do _ not interact _ with the surrounding nuclear medium within their formation time @xmath8 and thus do _ not _ create early pressure . on the other hand , for the leading pre - hadrons , i.e.  those involving quarks ( antiquarks ) from the struck nucleons , a reduced effective cross section @xmath12 is adopted during the formation time @xmath8 and the full hadronic cross section later on .",
    "the effective cross section @xmath12 is fixed in line with the additive constituent quark model @xcite ( cf . also section 3 ) .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for central au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev hadrons with transverse momenta larger than @xmath13 predominantly stem from the string ends and therefore can , in principle , interact directly with the reduced cross section @xmath12 . moreover , we have to stress that in the hsd approach the formation of secondary hadrons ( e.g. in au+au collisions ) is not only controlled by the formation time @xmath11 , but also by the energy density in the local rest frame : hadrons are not allowed to be formed if the energy density is larger than @xmath14 , which is about the critical energy density for a phase transition to the qgp in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the leading and energetic ( pre-)hadrons with the soft hadronic and bulk matter is thus explicitly modeled to happen only for local energy densities below that cut ,",
    "i.e. pre - hadronic interactions with fully formed hadrons as well as interactions between formed hadrons are delayed until the energy density has dropped below @xmath14 in the expansion phase !",
    "note , however , that the highest energy densities are achieved in the center of the fireball and that the formation of hadrons starts at the surface where substantially lower energy densities are encountered .",
    "we recall that the interactions of leading ( pre)hadrons are also important to understand the attenuation of hadrons with high ( longitudinal ) momentum in ordinary cold nuclear matter . the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) have shown that the dominant final - state - interactions of the hadrons with maximum momentum  as measured by the hermes collaboration @xcite  are compatible with the concepts described above .",
    "these independent investigations impose severe constraints on hadron attenuation in a medium that might possibly be attributed to a qgp phase ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the transverse momentum dynamics and especially on the very high momentum tail of the hadron spectra . in order to describe these high @xmath0 spectra",
    ", we use the pythia v6.2 event generator @xcite for nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions and the hsd transport model @xcite for the space - time localization of the events and further propagation in time including final - state interactions ( cf .",

    "our study is organized as follows : we start in section 2 with an analysis of high @xmath0 hadron events from @xmath15 reactions  generated via pythia v6.2  with respect to correlations in the azimuthal angle @xmath16 employing different momentum cuts for the hadrons .",
    "section 3 gives a very brief reminder of the hsd approach and the actual input to the transport calculations .",
    "the calculated results for jet quenching in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev for different centrality classes are presented in section 4",
    ". the sensitivity of the jet suppression to the formation time @xmath11 will be demonstrated , too . in section 5",
    "we will show the results of calculations for au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev for different centrality classes since this system is presently under investigation experimentally .",
    "apart from a comparison of the high @xmath0 attenuation of charged hadrons with the data from the phobos collaboration @xcite we will also present our predictions for the near - side and far - side angular correlations at this energy .",
    "section 6 summarizes our present investigations .",
    "before coming to the more subtle issue of jet quenching in au+au collisions at rhic energies , it is instructive to have a look at the jet topology in @xmath15 reactions . as mentioned before , we employ the event generator pythia v6.2 which has been adjusted with respect to the parameter to properly describe the transverse hadron spectra at @xmath2 = 200 gev ( cf .",

    "we choose a charged high @xmath0 hadron in the rapidity interval @xmath17 with momentum 4 gev / c @xmath18 6 gev / c as in ref .",

    "the resulting angular correlation @xmath21 with respect to the azimuthal angle of the trigger particle is displayed in fig .",
    "1 ( upper left part ) and shows two distinct peaks which are attributed to near - side and far - side jet correlations since the maxima at @xmath16=0 and @xmath22 correspond to back - to - back emission .",
    "furthermore , the comparison to the data from the star collaboration @xcite shows that the angular correlations measured for @xmath15 reactions at @xmath2 = 200 gev are well reproduced by the event generator pythia v6.2 .     for @xmath15 reactions at @xmath2 = 200 gev for different cuts on the trigger particle and associated particles from the event generator pythia v6.2 .",
    "the data in the upper left part are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=510 ]    the structure and relative height of the two peaks changes when selecting momenta 8 gev / c @xmath18 10 gev / c for the trigger particle and 4 gev / c @xmath19 for the other charged hadrons ( cf .",
    "1 , lower left part ) . in case of the higher momentum trigger particle",
    "the angular distribution of associated hadrons ( from jet fragmentation ) becomes narrower ; the far - side peak gets larger since the number of associated hadrons in the peaks are lower than for the cuts in the upper left part of fig .",
    "the asymmetry in the height of the peaks is due to the fact that the trigger particle is not counted in the near - side angular correlation .",
    "apart from the sensitivity to the momentum cuts demonstrated above the height of the peaks also depends on the rapidity cut for the associated particles . when gating on a larger rapidity interval @xmath23 ( r.h.s . of fig .",
    "1 ) the near - side peak roughly stays the same whereas the far - side peak increases by almost a factor of two .    a more detailed information is provided in the upper part of table 1 where the probability of finding 0 , 1 , @xmath24 , 3 further hadrons in the near - side and far - side peak is given for 4 gev / c @xmath18 6 gev / c and 2 gev / c @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these numbers demonstrate , that in less than 10% of all events a further particle is found in the given rapidity and @xmath0 interval and that the conditional probability to find any further particle roughly decreases by an order of magnitude .",
    "these low conditional probabilities should be kept in mind when comparing azimuthal angular correlations from au+au collisions ( cf . sections 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we note additionally that jet structures only show up after averaging over a large event sample .     near side & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 +   + 0 & 0.89 & 0.047 & 0.0060 & 0.00062 + 1 & 0.046 & 0.0078 & 0.0020 & 0.00031 + 2 & 0.0026 & 0.0010 & 0.00049 & 0.00012 + 3 & 0.00030 & 0.00013 & 0.000055 & 0.000017 +   + 0 & 0.93 & 0.024 & 0.0024 & 0.00034 + 1 & 0.040 & 0.0033 & 0.00043 & 0.000023 + 2 & 0.0031 & 0.00041 & 0.00016 & 0.000021 + 3 & 0.00040 & 0.00013 & 0.0000065 & 0 +    it is , furthermore , instructive to have a look at the rapidity distribution of charged particles when gating on a trigger hadron in the rapidity interval @xmath17 with momentum 4 gev / c @xmath18 6 gev / c .",
    "the correlated particles in the far - side peak  selected in the interval 2 gev / c @xmath25  then show a rather wide distribution in rapidity as seen from fig .",
    ", the upper solid line corresponds to the correlated charged hadrons in the far - side peak ( color : red ) whereas the lower solid line corresponds to the correlated charged hadrons in the near - side peak ( color : green ) which is localized in rapidity around the trigger particle .",
    "the dashed lines give the rapidity distribution for the correlated charged hadrons in the far - side ( upper dashed line , color : red ) and near - side peak ( upper dashed line , color : red ) which correspond to leading particles , i.e. where the hadron carries at least one of the constituent quarks of the initial protons .",
    "note that in @xmath15 collisions two strings are formed with in total four leading particles .",
    "for the momentum cuts adopted the leading particles show up dominantly at @xmath26 4 , i.e. in the rapidity regime of the projectile / target remnants .",
    "consequently , the hadrons produced and/or formed by the fragmentation of jets do not occupy a narrow rapidity window close to the trigger hadron but are widespread in rapidity at least in the far - side peak ( with even a small dip at midrapidity ) .",
    "this wide distribution also explains why the probability of observing a correlated hadron together with a trigger hadron in roughly the same rapidity interval @xmath27 and high momentum is rather low ( cf .",
    "upper part of table 1 ) .",
    "we employ the hsd transport model @xcite for our study of p+a , d+a and a+a collisions .",
    "this approach takes into account the formation and multiple rescattering of formed hadrons as well as unformed leading pre  hadrons and thus incorporates the dominant final state interactions . in the transport approach",
    "we include nucleons , @xmath28 s , n@xmath29(1440 ) , n@xmath29(1535 ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 hyperons , @xmath33 s , @xmath34 s and @xmath35 s as well as their antiparticles on the baryonic side whereas the @xmath36 and @xmath37 octet states are included in the mesonic sector .",
    "inelastic hadron ",
    "hadron collisions with energies above @xmath38 are described by the fritiof model @xcite ( employing pythia v5.5 with jetset v7.3 for the production and fragmentation of jets @xcite ) whereas low energy hadron ",
    "hadron collisions are modeled in line with experimental cross sections .",
    "we mention that no explicit parton cascading is involved in our transport calculations contrary to e.g.  the ampt model @xcite or explicit parton cascades @xcite .    a systematic analysis of hsd results and experimental data for central nucleus  nucleus collisions for 2 agev to 21.3 atev",
    "has shown that the spectra for the longitudinal rapidity distribution of protons , pions , kaons , antikaons and hyperons are in reasonable agreement with available data .",
    "only the pion rapidity spectra are slightly overestimated from ags to sps energies @xcite which implies , that the maximum in the @xmath39 ratio at @xmath4030 agev  seen in central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions @xcite  is missed .",
    "furthermore , there are more severe problems with the dynamics in the direction transverse to the beam .",
    "whereas the pion transverse momentum spectra are rather well described from lower ags to top rhic energies the transverse momentum slopes of kaons / antikaons are clearly underestimated above @xmath3 5 agev in central au+au collisions . in ref .",
    "@xcite this failure has been attributed to a lack of pressure generation in the very early phase of the heavy - ion collisions which also points towards a new state of very strongly interacting matter in the very early phase of central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions .",
    "in addition , the elliptic flow of high @xmath0 hadrons is missed substantially @xcite which also suggests strongly interacting matter in the very early phase .",
    "inspite of the deficiences pointed out the overall reproduction of the experimental spectra is sufficiently realistic such that we can proceed with more exclusive probes that are produced and propagated in the background of the expanding string / hadron matter generated in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "for the production and propagation of hadrons with high transverse momentum ( @xmath41 ) we employ a perturbative scheme as also used in refs .",
    "@xcite for the charm and open charm degrees of freedom and in ref .",
    "@xcite for high @xmath0 hadrons .",
    "the initial conditions for the production and also subsequent propagation of hadrons with moderate to high transverse momentum ( @xmath42 ) are incorporated in the hsd approach by a superposition of @xmath15 collisions described via pythia @xcite which serve as the basic input .",
    "the partons ( from pythia ) fragment to hadrons  according to the jetset - part of pythia  with the vacuum fragmentation functions .",
    "we mention that medium - modified fragmentation schemes might have to be employed for nucleus - nucleus collisions , however , we will only use the vacuum fragmentation functions in this study in order to find out , if this minimal scheme also applies for the heavy - ion case .",
    "together with the 4-momenta of all resulting particles we store the constituent quark content and the relative weight @xmath43 of each event .",
    "the weight @xmath43 is given by the ratio of the actual production cross section divided by the inelastic nucleon  nucleon cross section , e.g. @xmath44 all particles with one or more constituent quarks are denoted as pre - hadrons while those without are denoted as secondary hadrons .",
    "the pre - hadrons start propagating in space - time from the space - time position of the individual interaction vertex @xmath45 , which is well defined from the transport calculation , and begin to interact immediately with a fractional cross section according to the constituent quark model ( see below ) .",
    "the secondaries are inserted in the dynamical calculation after their formation time @xmath8 ( in the actual reference frame ) at a space - time position which is displayed from the vertex @xmath45 by @xmath46 with @xmath47 denoting the velocity of the secondary hadron @xmath48 .",
    "the velocity @xmath47 is fixed in the calculation by the momentum and energy of the finally formed hadron @xmath48 , which is an approximation . in practice",
    "the major fraction of secondaries shows up with velocities close to 1 ( in units of @xmath49 ) such that alternative modelings have no major effect on the final results for attenuation .",
    "we then follow the motion of the perturbative hadrons within the full background of strings / hadrons by propagating them as free particles , i.e.  neglecting in  medium potentials , but compute their collisional history with baryons and mesons or quarks and diquarks . for reactions with diquarks we use the corresponding reaction cross section with baryons multiplied by a factor of 2/3 . for collisions with quarks ( antiquarks )",
    "we adopt half of the cross section for collisions with mesons and for the leading pre - hadron ( formed ) baryon collision a factor of 1/3 is assumed .",
    "the elastic and inelastic interactions with their fractional cross section are modeled in the hsd approach in the same way as for ordinary hadrons with the same quantum numbers via the fritiof model @xcite ( including pythia v5.5 with jetset v7.3 for the production and fragmentation of jets @xcite ) .",
    "this concept  oriented along the additive quark model  has been proven to work rather well for nucleus  nucleus collisions from ags to rhic energies @xcite as well as in hadron formation and attenuation in deep inelastic lepton scattering off nuclei @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the latter reactions are important to understand the attenuation of pre  hadrons or ordinary hadrons with high momentum in cold nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "our studies in ref .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the dominant final state interactions of the hadrons with maximum momentum , as measured by the hermes collaboration @xcite , are compatible to the concepts described above .",
    "this also holds for antiproton production and attenuation in proton  nucleus collisions at ags energies @xcite .",
    "as known from the experimental studies of refs .",
    "@xcite an enhancement of the high transverse momentum particle cross section from proton  nucleus collisions  relative to scaled @xmath15 collisions  is already observed at sps and isr energies .",
    "this cronin effect is probably related to an increase of the average transverse momentum squared @xmath50 of the partons in the nuclear medium .",
    "one may speculate that such an enhancement of @xmath50 is due to induced initial semi  hard gluon radiation in the medium , which is not present in the vacuum due to color neutrality @xcite .",
    "since the microscopic mechanisms are beyond the scope of our present analysis , we simulate this effect in the transport approach by increasing the average @xmath50 in the string fragmentation with the number of previous collisions @xmath51 as @xcite @xmath52 the parameter @xmath53 in ( [ kt ] ) has been fixed in comparison to the experimental data for d+au collisions at rhic @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in our previous analysis @xcite the cronin effect",

    "the quantity @xmath55 denotes the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions  directly available from the transport calculation ",
    "while @xmath56 stands for the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section ( known experimentally ) .",

    "we have gated on high @xmath0 particles in the interval ( @xmath61 ) and accumulated further charged hadrons in the interval @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in addition to the angular correlations from au+au collisions we have added the results from @xmath15 reactions ( dashed lines ) in comparison to the data from star for @xmath15 collisions @xcite ( full dots ) for each centrality bin to demonstrate both the actual statistical uncertainty due to different event samples for the varying centralities ( dashed lines ) and the actual attenuation generated by the final state interactions in the transport calculation ( solid lines , color : green ) .    we find that  when gating on high @xmath0 hadrons ( in the vacuum )  the near ",

    "side correlations observed for jet fragmentation in the vacuum ( cf .",

    "apparently , this power law in @xmath67 is too strong in comparison to the transport calculation ( full dots ) .",
    "we note that a rather good reproduction of the hsd results is obtained when comparing to the quadratic average of the long and short axis of the almond shaped interaction zone  in @xmath70 direction  as a function of impact parameter @xmath71 , @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 denoting the radius of the au - target in hard - sphere geometry .",

    "the numerical results of the hsd calculations we conclude that the suppression in the transport calculations is essentially determined by a linear geometrical length scale , i.e. by the average jet propagation length in the almond shaped reaction zone ( cf . ref .",
    "note in addition that the relation @xmath76 is model dependent for very peripheral reactions ( small @xmath67 ) .",
    "since the suppression of far - side jets from pre - hadronic final state interactions in our transport calculations is less than 60% at all centralities , there should be an additional suppression mechanism at least for mid - central and central collisions that is not included in the present transport approach .",
    "since the dynamics at intermediate and late times are expected to be properly described by hsd only the very early phase of the nucleus - nucleus collision should be failed .",
    "we recall that in hsd ( as well as urqmd @xcite ) there are dominantly collisions of pre - hadrons ( string ends ) in the early collision phase which neither generate enough early transverse pressure @xcite , elliptic flow @xcite or attenuation of high @xmath0 hadrons @xcite .",
    "these general findings are in line with those seen in the suppression of far - side jets in figs . 3 and 4 : the medium of strings ( pre - hadrons ) is not interacting strongly enough to explain an almost complete quenching of far - side jets in central au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",

    "nevertheless , one might argue that this formation time is simply not short enough and an alternative fixing might yield the proper jet suppression .",
    "a similar analysis e.g. has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite with respect to the strength of the elliptic flow @xmath77 of charged hadrons , where shorter formation times @xmath11 lead to an increase of the interaction rate at short times and consequently to a rise of the elliptic flow . to this aim",
    "we have performed calculations for 5% central au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev introducing an independent formation time @xmath11 for the jets and their fragmentation products without changing the formation time of the bulk non - perturbative hadrons .",
    "the results of these calculations for the azimuthal angular correlations are shown in fig . 5 for @xmath11 = 0.5 ( l.h.s . ) and 0.2 fm / c ( r.h.s . ) by the solid lines ( color : green ) .",
    "in fact , the attenuation of the far - side peak increases with decreasing formation time .",
    "however , also the near - side peak now shows a reduction by the final state interactions as seen from a comparison of the dashed and solid lines .",
    "this reduction of the near - side peak is still very modest for @xmath11 = 0.5 fm / c but reaches a level of @xmath3 50% for @xmath11 = 0.2 fm / c which can clearly be ruled out by the present data . in short : a sizeable reduction of the formation time - though leading to a more substantial suppression of the far - side peak as well as to an increase of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons @xcite  is incompatible with the experimental observations for central au+au collisions .",
    "without explicit representation we mention that a decrease in the energy density cut for hadron formation ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) from 1 gev/@xmath4 to 0.7 gev/@xmath4 leads only to a small reduction of the far - side jet suppression .",
    "this also holds for a moderate increase of the cross section for the pre - hadronic states .",
    "these results are easy to understand : the leading pre - hadrons in central collisions are attenuated by a factor of about 15 ( cf .",
    "fig . 8 of @xcite ) with the standard cross sections , such that these particles are practically erased .",
    "furthermore , only 70 - 80% of high @xmath0 hadrons are pre - hadrons ( cf .",
    "fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that a larger cross section would violate unitarity since the full hadronic cross section for short time scales is already exploited within the constituent quark model .",
    "accordingly , the secondaries have to start with a vanishing cross section at the space - time point of the vertex or more precisely starting from the quark - antiquark production point that we denote by @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "fig . 3 in @xcite ) which is a fraction of 1 fm / c .",
    "during the early times , when the system is very dense , the secondaries thus have small or vanishing cross section up to their hadron formation time @xmath8 ( 1 ) .",
    "the latter becomes large for high @xmath0 momenta such that the attenuation of secondaries is rather low when employing high @xmath0 cuts .",
    "( [ ratioaa ] ) of charged hadrons for different centralities for au+au at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "the hatched bands correspond to our calculations with a cronin parameter @xmath79 in ( [ kt ] ) ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 as in ref .",
    ", width=434 ]",
    "the system au+au at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev has recently been investigated experimentally at rhic and first results on hadron attenuation have become available at moderate @xmath0 from the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "we thus start with single hadron attenuation in the next subsection following exactly the studies in ref . @xcite that have been performed at @xmath2 = 200 gev . since all details have been presented in the former publication we step on with the actual results .",
    "however , it is worth to point out that the cronin enhancement factors are higher at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev than at @xmath2 = 200 gev due to steeper hadron spectra in @xmath0 ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the centrality dependence of the ratio @xmath80 for charged hadrons is shown in fig . 6 for @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath82,@xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 centrality of au+au collisions at .",
    "again the hatched bands ( color : light blue ) correspond to our calculations with a cronin parameter @xmath79 in ( [ kt ] ) ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 while the data stem from ref .",
    "note , that the uncertainty in the cronin enhancement ( width of the hatched band ) decreases slightly for more peripheral reactions , which is a direct consequence of the lower number of hard @xmath87 collisions in ( [ kt ] ) .",
    "we emphasize , that the cronin enhancement is most visible at momenta up to 5 gev / c but is practically negligible for @xmath88 6 - 8 gev / c . as pointed out before in ref .",
    "@xcite , the suppression seen in the calculation for larger transverse momentum hadrons is due to the interactions of the leading ( pre-)hadrons with target / projectile nucleons and the bulk of low momentum hadrons . accordingly , the ratio @xmath80 drops below 1 in fig . 6 in the high momentum regime",
    "reaching an attenuation which is about the same as that in the calculations for @xmath2 = 200 gev and @xmath89 5 gev / c .",
    "our numerical results in fig .",
    "6 are roughly compatible with the data from the phobos collaboration @xcite but measurements at higher transverse momenta will be necessary to prove / disprove the dropping of the ratio @xmath80 with momentum @xmath0 ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      whereas first experimental information on the single hadron attenuation is available ( cf .",
    "previous subsection ) the quenching of far - side jets at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev is still unknown from the experimental side . in this respect",
    "we provide predictions on the basis of our hsd calculations for the angular correlations in @xmath15 and au+au collisions .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the angular correlations of near - side and far - side charged hadrons by gating on high @xmath0 particles in the interval ( @xmath90 = @xmath91 ) and accumulating further charged hadrons in the interval @xmath62 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "in addition to the angular correlations from central au+au collisions ( solid lines ) we have added the results from @xmath15 reactions ( dashed lines ) as resulting from the pythia calculations .",
    "these pythia results serve again as reference lines for the angular correlation without any final state interaction .",
    "it is seen from the @xmath15 as well as au+au angular correlations that the far - side peaks are more pronounced ( within the cuts taken ) than the near - side peaks .",
    "this effect can be traced back to the low probability of observing a further hadron close to the near - side peak when gating on a high momentum trigger particle ; most of the associated hadrons can be found in the far - side peak .",
    "this comes about because the trigger particle is not counted in the near - side correlation whereas the far - side correlation includes the leading particle of the partner jet .",
    "this explanation is quantified in table 2 where the probability for having 0@xmath93 3 further charged particles in the near - side and far - side region is given for @xmath15 ( upper part ) and central au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev .     near side & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 +   + 0 & 0.82 & 0.13 & 0.014 & 0.00062 + 1 & 0.026 & 0.011 & 0.0032 & 0.00029 + 2 & 0.00068 & 0.00061 & 0.00017 & 0.000041 + 3 & 0.000022 & 0.000007 & 0.000023 & 0.0000028 +   + 0 & 0.91 & 0.051 & 0.0036 & 0.00011 + 1 & 0.026 & 0.0038 & 0.00061 & 0.000014 + 2 & 0.00033 & 0.000017 & 0.000013 & 0 + 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 +    the relative suppression of the near - side peak is very moderate whereas the relative suppression of the far - side correlation in central au+au relative to @xmath15 reactions is @xmath3 60 % as for @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that the cross section of pre - hadrons with ordinary hadrons or quark - diquark fragments of the initial hadrons is almost independent on energy and the string density only moderately lower at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev .",
    "on the other hand , ordinary hadrons are allowed to form slightly earlier because the energy density ( in the local rest frame ) drops faster below 1 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "summarizing , we point out that ( pre- ) hadronic final state interactions contribute significantly to the high @xmath0 suppression effects observed in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "this finding is important , since the same dynamics also describe the hadron formation and attenuation in deep ",
    "inelastic lepton scattering off nuclei at hermes @xcite appreciably well .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that the centrality dependence of the modification factor @xmath80 ( [ ratioaa ] ) in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev is well described for peripheral and mid  central collisions on the basis of leading pre - hadron interactions @xcite whereas the attenuation in central au+au collisions is noticeably underestimated .",
    "a similar observation also holds for an analysis of the far - side angular correlations , which show a substantial , but not fully complete suppression in central collisions as indicated by the experimental data @xcite . from these results",
    "one should conclude that there are some additional ( and earlier ) interactions of partons in a possibly colored medium that have not been accounted for in our present hsd transport studies .",
    "we have , furthermore , explored the possibility if shorter formations times @xmath11 for the hadrons might lead to an improved description of the angular correlation data since smaller @xmath11 lead to an increase of the interaction rate at early times and to an increase of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "however , for formation times @xmath94 0.5 fm / c also the near - side peak shows a reduction by the final state interactions .",
    "this reduction of the near - side peak is still very modest for @xmath11 = 0.5 fm / c but reaches a level of @xmath3 50% for @xmath11 = 0.2 fm / c which can be ruled out by the present data . in short : a sizeable reduction of the formation time - though leading to a more substantial suppression of the far - side peak and to an increase of the elliptic flow @xmath77 of hadrons  is incompatible with the experimental observations for central au+au collisions .",
    "we close in pointing out that further experimental studies on the suppression of high momentum hadrons from d+au and au+au collisions down to @xmath2 = 20 gev will be necessary to clearly separate initial state cronin effects from final state attenuation and to disentangle the role of partons in a colored partonic medium from those of interacting pre - hadrons in an approximately color - neutral hot and dense fireball . a major problem",
    ", however , is that the jets escaping the medium stem from the corona of the fireball @xcite and thus do not carry much information from the dense medium .",
    "nevertheless , far - side jet suppression appears to be a promising observable since the pre - hadronic ( color neutral ) interactions employed so far lead to a suppression that is dominantly characterized by a linear length scale ( cf .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "thus when gating on peripheral reactions with @xmath67 from 50 to 150 one might exploit the geometry of the fireball  which is of approximate almond shape  in more detail . to this aim narrow bins in @xmath67 should be performed and the di - hadron correlations be investigated as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath95 of the trigger hadron relative to the reaction plane . furthermore , also several cuts in the minimum transverse momentum of the associated particles should be taken .",
    "it is clear that very high statistics for jet correlations will be needed to obtain a solid information .",
    "some experimental work along this direction is presently carried out .",
