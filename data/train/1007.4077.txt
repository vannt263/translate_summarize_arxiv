    "recently , the data analysis of interferometric gravitational waves ( gws ) detectors has been started ( for the current status of gws interferometers see @xcite ) and the scientific community aims in a first direct detection of gws in next years .",
    "detectors for gws will be important for a better knowledge of the universe and also to confirm or to rule out the physical consistency of general relativity or of any other theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the context of extended theories of gravity , some differences between general relativity and the others theories can be pointed out starting by the linearized theory of gravity @xcite .    in this picture , detectors for gws are in principle sensitive also to a hypothetical _ scalar _ component of gravitational radiation , that appears in extended theories of gravity like scalar - tensor gravity and high order theories @xcite , brans - dicke theory @xcite and string theory @xcite .",
    "a possible target of these experiments is the so called stochastic background of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the production of the primordial part of this stochastic background ( relic gws ) is well known in the literature starting by the works of @xcite and @xcite , that , using the so called adiabatically - amplified zero - point fluctuations process , have shown in two different ways how the standard inflationary scenario for the early universe can in principle provide a distinctive spectrum of relic gravitational waves . in @xcite",
    "the primordial production has been analysed for the scalar component admitted from scalar - tensor gravity .    in this paper",
    ", it is shown that , in general , f(r ) theories of gravity produce a third massive polarization of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this polarization is analysed adapting the adiabatically - amplified zero - point fluctuations process at this case . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "such a process has been applied to the same class of theories , i.e. the @xmath0 ones , which will be discussed in the present work .",
    "but , in @xcite a different point of view has been considered . in that case , by using a conform analysis , the authors discussed such a process in respect to the two standard polarizations which arises from standard general relativity . in the present paper the analysis is focused to the third massive polarization . in this way , we generalize previous results where only particular cases of f(r ) theories have been analysed ( see @xcite for example ) .    regarding f(r ) theories , even if such theories have to be dismissed either because they contradict the current cosmology and solar system tests or generate  \" ghosts  \" in what would be a quantum version of the finite range gravity@xcite , a number of authors manage to avoid both of such problems @xcite .    concerning the presence of the graviton mass , it was considered by many authors since and pauli ( 1939 ) @xcite .",
    "important contributions in this sense are the ones in @xcite . in these papers",
    ", it is emphasized that the presence of the mass modifies general relativity on various scales , which are defined by the compton wavelength of gravitons .",
    "this fact leads to dispersion of waves and yukawa - like potentials in the linearized theory . on the other hand",
    ", it also leads to other modifications in general relativity solutions in high - order ( i.e. non - linear ) regimes .",
    "the fact that gravitational waves can have mass could also have important applications in cosmology because such masses could give a contribution to the dark matter of the universe .",
    "an upper bound for these relic gravitational waves , which arises from the wmap constrains , is also released .",
    "about this point , a different interesting treatment of the additional polarizations and impact on cosmic microwave background has been recently discussed in the good paper @xcite .    at the end of the paper the potential detection of such massive gravitational waves using interferometers like virgo and ligo",
    "is discussed .",
    "let us consider the action@xmath1    where @xmath2 is the ricci curvature scalar .    equation ( [ eq : high order 1 ] ) represents the action of the so called @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite in respect to the well known canonical one of general relativity ( the einstein - hilbert action @xcite ) which is    @xmath3    the action ( [ eq : high order 1 ] ) has been analysed in @xcite in cosmological contexts .",

    "@xmath15    a klein - gordon equation for the effective @xmath16 scalar field is obtained :    @xcite@xmath17    to study gravitational waves , the linearized theory has to be analysed , with a little perturbation of the background , which is assumed given by a near minkowskian background , i.e. a minkowskian background plus @xmath18 ( the ricci scalar is assumed constant in the background ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is also assumed to be a steady minimum for the effective potential @xmath20 , that called @xmath21 .",
    "this assumption is vital for the further calculations @xcite and its physical justification arises from the fact that the effective @xmath16 scalar field is a function of the ricci curvature and here the linearized theory is developed , i.e. only weak perturbations near a _ fixed _ curvature are considered .",

    "this is an analysis _ totally equivalent _ to the case of the linearization process for scalar - tensor gravity , see for example @xcite . in section 4 of @xcite",
    "the authors claim that _ `` we linearize the equations near the background ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , where @xmath23 is a minimum of @xmath20''_. the difference with the present analysis is that in @xcite the scalar field which is a minimum of the potential arises directly from the brans - dicke theory @xcite , while in the present analysis an effective scalar field and an effective potential arise directly from spacetime curvature ( the effective scalar field is the prime derivative @xmath11 , see eq .",

    "( [ eq : ridefiniz ] ) it is    @xmath56    at this point , if being in the massless case @xcite , one puts    @xmath57    which gives the total transverse effect of the field .",

    "inflationary models provide solutions to the horizon and flatness problems and contain a mechanism which creates perturbations in all fields .",
    "important for our goals is that this mechanism also provides a distinctive spectrum of relic gws .",

    "the importance of standard de sitter inflation in the general framework of the primordial production of relic gravitational waves has been recently shown in @xcite considering a different point of view . in that case , using a conform analysis , the authors discussed such a process in respect to the two standard polarizations which arises from standard general relativity . in the following , the analysis is focused to the third massive polarization .",
    "thus , in a certain sense , the present analysis is an integration of the analysis in @xcite .",
    "remaining in the tapestry of f(r ) theories , there are lots of examples in the literature where the line element ( [ eq : metrica ] ) , which is the perturbed form of the standard conformally flat robertson - walker one , results a solution of the general field equations ( 6 ) .",
    "one can see for example the recent reviews @xcite .    in the line element ( [ eq : metrica ] ) , by considering only the third polarization , the metric perturbation ( [ eq : perturbazione totale ] ) reduces to    @xmath84    where @xmath85    in the de sitter phase ( @xmath86 ) the equation of state is @xmath87 , the scale factor is @xmath88 and the hubble constant is given by @xmath89 .    in the radiation dominated phase @xmath90 the equation of state is @xmath91 , the scale factor is @xmath92 and the hubble constant is given by @xmath93  @xcite .    expressing the scale factor in terms of comoving time defined by    @xmath94    one gets    @xmath95    during the de sitter phase and    @xmath96    during the radiation dominated phase .",

    "the solution ( [ eq : ampiezza inflaz . ] ) corresponds precisely to this de sitter vacuum state @xcite .",

    "the coefficients of @xmath113 are the eigenmodes which describe particles while the coefficients of @xmath114 are the eigenmodes which describe antiparticles .",

    "in such a work , it has been shown that the energy associated to the monopole mode of the scalar particle is quite lower in respect to the energy carried by ordinary quadrupole modes arising from the linearization of standard general relativity .",

    ", even if the ratio of differential mode to common mode is large in the case of the binary pulsar , it could be , in principle , similar and potentially small in cosmology .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath0 theories such a mode arises directly from a function of the ricci scalar , see the first identification ( [ eq : identifica ] ) , i.e. _ it arises from spacetime curvature _ , and it is well known that , being the production of relic gws near the bounds of the planck epoch and the initial singularity , in this early era both of spacetime curvature and its variations were very high . thus , in this cosmological case , the amplitude of the common mode could be even dominant in respect to differential modes .",

    "( [ eq : componenti riemann ] ) , it is    @xmath166    which shows that the field is not transversal .",
    "in fact , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : deviazione geodetiche ] ) it results    @xmath167    @xmath168    and    @xmath169    then , the effect of the mass is the generation of a _ longitudinal _ force ( in addition to the transverse one ) .    for a better understanding of this longitudinal force , let us analyse the effect on test masses in the context of the geodesic deviation .",
    "following @xcite one puts@xmath170    here the transverse projector with respect to the direction of propagation of the gw @xmath171 , defined by    @xmath172    and the longitudinal projector defined by    @xmath173    have been used . in this way , the geodesic deviation equation ( [ eq : deviazione geodetiche ] ) can be rewritten like    @xmath174    thus , it appears clear that the effect of the mass present in the gw generates a longitudinal force proportional to @xmath175 which is in addition to the transverse one .",
    "but if @xmath176 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocita di gruppo 2 ] ) one gets @xmath177 , and the longitudinal force vanishes .",
    "then , it is clear that the longitudinal mode arises from the fact that the gw does no propagate at the speed of light .",
    "now , let us analyse the detectability of the third polarization computing the pattern function of a detector to this massive component .",
    "one has to recall that it is possible to associate to a detector a _ detector tensor _ that , for an interferometer with arms along the @xmath178 e @xmath179 directions in respect to the propagating gravitational wave ( see figure 2 ) , is defined by @xcite@xmath180        if the detector is an interferometer @xcite , the signal induced by a gw of a generic polarization , here labelled with @xmath181 is the phase shift , which is proportional to @xcite    @xmath182    and , using equations ( [ eq : eqs ] ) , one gets    @xmath183    the angular dependence ( [ eq : legame onda - output 2 ] ) , is different from the two well known standard ones arising from general relativity which are , respectively @xmath184 for the @xmath185 polarization and @xmath186 for the @xmath187 polarization .",
    "thus , in principle , the angular dependence ( [ eq : legame onda - output 2 ] ) could be used to discriminate among @xmath0 theories and general relativity , if present or future detectors will achieve a high sensitivity .",
    "the third angular dependence is shown in figure .    ) ]    for a sake of completeness , let us recall that there is one more problem with the potential detection of the common mode .",
    "this is because the sensitivity curve drawn for different detectors is for the differential mode .",
    "the common mode is also registered during the gw experiment but it is much noisier , therefore it has different sensitivity level @xcite .",
    "actually , this is correct for studies on potential detection in the case of wavelength of the wave much larger than the linear dimension of the interferometer ( low frequencies approximation ) . in previous analysis",
    ", we have implicitly assumed to be in such an approximation , and in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : definizione d ] ) , ( [ eq : legame onda - output ] ) and ( [ eq : legame onda - output 2 ] ) are strictly valid only in this approximation . a recent analysis @xcite has shown",
    "that , in the case in which the differential mode is massive , the response function of an interferometer _ increases _ with increasing frequency differently from the case of massless modes where the response function _ decreases _ with increasing frequency .",
    "this opens important perspectives for a potential detection of the massive mode at high frequency . in @xcite",
    "the response function has only been computed in the case of a massive mode propagating parallel to one arm of the interferometer , thus , further studies in this direction are needed .",
    "for example , it will be quite interesting to generalize the frequency dependence of the angular pattern ( [ eq : legame onda - output 2 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that , in general , @xmath0 theories produce a third massive polarization of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this polarization has been analysed adapting the adiabatically - amplified zero - point fluctuations process at this case and generalizing previous results in which only particular cases have been discussed .",
    "the presence of the mass could also have important applications in cosmology because the fact that gravitational waves can have mass could give a contribution to the dark matter of the universe .",
    "an upper bound for these relic gravitational waves , which arises from the wmap constrains , has been also released and at the end of the paper and the potential detection of such massive gws using interferometers like virgo and ligo has been discussed .",
