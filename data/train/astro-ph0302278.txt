    "it is commonly accepted that the spectral sequence along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase ( m@xmath3ms@xmath3s@xmath3sc@xmath3c ) is , in fact , a chemical sequence in which the carbon content in the stellar envelope continuously increases due to the operation of the so - called 3@xmath4 dredge - up ( tdu ) mechanism .",
    "the tdu transports to the envelope fresh carbon immediately after each thermal pulse ( tp ) of the he - shell .",
    "in such a way , an agb star of m - type with a ratio in the envelope c / o@xmath5 becomes a carbon c(n ) star when this ratio exceeds unity , c / o@xmath6 .",
    "another important consequence of tdu is the enrichment of the envelope in _",
    "the necessary neutrons for the @xmath0-process are released by two reactions : @xmath2c@xmath7o , which provides the bulk of the neutron flux at low neutron densities ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10ne@xmath11 mg , which is activated at temperatures @xmath12 k , providing a high peak neutron density ( @xmath13 @xmath9 ) and is responsible of the production of @xmath0-nuclei controlled by reaction branchings ( see e.g. busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) .",
    "the abundances of @xmath0-nuclei are known to increase along the above mentioned spectral sequence , as the star gradually ascends the agb .",
    "evidence of this was provided during the last few decades by several studies on agb stars of different spectral types ( see busso et al . 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the importance of the study of agb stars is obvious : i ) they are excellent laboratories to test the theory of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis ( note , in addition , that they are progenitors of planetary nebulae and white dwarfs ) ii ) in particular c(n ) stars are the main producers of the heavy s - elemnts ( a@xmath14 ) in the galaxy as well as of a substantial fraction of @xmath1c , @xmath15n , @xmath16li and @xmath2c .",
    "however , an evaluation of such chemical yields firstly needs accurate abundance determinations .",
    "second , in order to understand the role played by these stars in the chemical evolution of the galaxy it is mandatory to know their typical masses and the frequency of binarity among them . in this work",
    ", we will address these questions .",
    "so far the only available abundances were still those by utsumi ( 1985 ) based on photographic plates and/or low resolution spectra .",
    "c(n ) stars are very difficult to analyse spectroscopically because of their very crowded spectra .",
    "the spectrum of these stars is dominated by molecular absorptions ( cn , c@xmath17 , ch ... ) , which require the knowledge of accurate spectroscopic information of these molecules for the chemical analysis .",
    "the use of high resolution and high signal to noise ratio spectra is also mandatory and even in that case , only a few spectral _ windows _ are available for abundance analysis : @xmath18  , for @xmath0-elementsand metals , @xmath19  for the rb analysis , @xmath20  for the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios and several li i lines . in our analysis of a sample of @xmath21 galactic c(n ) , we used high resolution ( @xmath22 ) spectra obtained with the 4.2 m wht at el roque de los muchahos and with the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto .",
    "we use the spectrum synthesis technique to derive all the abundance figures .",
    "the determination of the stellar parameters was made as in abia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see this paper for details ) .",
    "c(n ) stars show overabundances in s - process elements . for the low atomic mass number ( sr , y , zr ) @xmath0-elements(ls )",
    "we found a mean enhancement with respect to the metallicity [ @xmath23ls@xmath24/m]=@xmath25 , while for the high atomic mass number ( ba , la , nd , ce , sm ) @xmath0-elements(hs ) the mean overabundance is [ @xmath23hs@xmath24/m]=@xmath26 .",
    "these enhancements are significantly lower than the previous estimations by utsumi ( 1985 ) and set the s - element overabundances in c(n ) stars at the same level or slightly higher than those found in s stars . from the theoretical point of view , this result can be easily understood considering that the overwhelming majority of the c(n ) stars analysed here have a c / o ratio very close to the unity ( @xmath23c / o@xmath27 ) : in a single episode of tp and tdu , a s - star ( c / o@xmath28 ) can become a c(n ) star without increasing significantly the s - element enhancement in the envelope .",
    "c(n ) stars with larger c / o ratios and s - element overabundances must lokely exist , however they escape optical detection because of the formation of a thick circumstellar envelope due to high mass - loss rates .",
    "our c(n ) star sample is probably observationally biased in this sense . in figure 1 we compare the [ hs / ls ] vs. [ m / h ] ratios obtained with theoretical s - process nucleosynthesis models in a representative case of a 1.5 m@xmath29 agb star ( see gallino et al .",
    "1988 ; busso et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "solid line shows the prediction corresponding to a standard ( st ) case which assumes the radiative burning of @xmath30 m@xmath29 of @xmath2c in a tiny _ pocket _ in the intershell region .",
    "the upper and lower curves ( dashed lines ) limit the region allowed by the models according to the different @xmath2c - pocket choices scaled to the st case .",
    "model predictions and observations are in nice agreement .",
    "note that the utsumi s data are marginally in agreement with theoretical models .",
    "theoretical predictions for s - process as those showed in figure 1 do not significantly differ for a 3 @xmath31 .",
    "remarkable differences exist for more massive stars , but they are not sufficient to allow a clear discrimination of the stellar mass . to infer the mass of c(n ) stars we can make use of a neutron density sensitive element : rb . depending of the neutron density in the s - process ( i.e. depending on whether the @xmath2c ( m@xmath32 @xmath31 ) or @xmath10ne ( m@xmath33 @xmath31 ) neutron sources provides the bulk of neutrons )",
    ", a very different abundance pattern between rb and its neighbours ( sr , y and zr ) is expected .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of such a comparison .",
    "it is evident that the predictions for a 1.5 @xmath31 model fit much better the observed [ rb / x ] ratios and we can conclude that the majority of c(n ) stars studied here are low - mass stars ( m@xmath32 @xmath31 ) .",
    "this figure concerning the most probable mass for c(n ) stars is reinforced from the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios derived .",
    "a large number of the carbon stars studied here have @xmath1c/@xmath2c@xmath34 .",
    "these ratios can not be explained by the standard evolutionary models on the agb .",
    "such low ratios might be explained if an extra - mixing process is operating during the agb phase preferably in low mass stars .",
    "this non - standard mixing process , perhaps induced by rotation , has been named _",
    "cool bottom processing _",
    "( wasserburg , boothroyd & sackmann 1995 ; nollet , busso & wasserburg 2003 ) and might explain the low @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios found in many low mass rgb stars .",
    "abia et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived li abundances in a sample of 230 galactic carbon stars .",
    "the most important result of this work was the confirmation that a small fraction ( 2 - 3@xmath35 ) are super li - rich carbon stars , showing li abundances as high as log @xmath36(li)@xmath37 .",
    "in addition , a significant number ( @xmath38 ) can be considered as li - rich c - stars , with li abundances in the range 1 - 2 . when interpreting these observations on the basis of theoretical models some problems appear .",
    "first , how reliable are the li abundances derived ?",
    "yakovina , pavlenko & abia ( 2002 ) have recently derived li abundances in super li - rich c - stars using four different li lines .",
    "they show that even considering corrections by n - lte effects the li abundances derived from different lines show a high dispersion .",
    "they interpreted this as an evidence of the difficulty and uncertainties still present in the modelling of the atmospheres of agb stars and put a note of caution when estimating the li yield from agb stars .",
    "other figures are also difficult to understand : i ) at solar metallicity , the super li - rich phenomenon is expected for o - rich agb stars , not for c - rich objects .",
    "ii ) some super li - rich stars are fainter ( m@xmath39 ) than theoretically predicted .",
    "iii ) theoretical models predict maximum li abundances @xmath40 , however a few stars show peak li abundances close to 5 ( even considering the large error bars ) .",
    "iv ) how can we explain the large fraction of li - rich c - stars ?",
    "some of these stars are classified as j - type carbon stars which might not be agb stars , but a significant number of them are indeed normal ( n ) carbon stars .",
    "v ) why many galactic o - rich and li - rich agb stars do not show s - process element enhancements ( garca - lario et al .",
    "1999 ) ? considering that",
    "most of galactic c - stars are of low mass , for which no li production is predicted ( see sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) , it seems evident that also an additional non - standard mixing process affecting li might play a role in low mass agb stars .",
    "theoretical modelling is therefore required , but models like those discussed by nollet , busso & wasserburg ( 2003 ) can explain in a unique scenario high li abundances and low @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios , also predicting anomalies in the oxygen isotopic ratios and consistent production of @xmath41al .",
    "let us finally address the question whether the stars studied here are intrinsic or extrinsic agb stars , ie : their abundances are locally produced by the occurrence of tp during the agb phase , or generated by mass transfer in binary systems . as far as we know no significant radial velocity variations have been detected in any of them .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 of the sample stars show @xmath43tc , an incontestable signature of the tp and tdu operation , thus , of their intrinsic nature . a further test can be done looking for infrared excess as has been done by jorissen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in s - stars .",
    "if the stars are tp - agb stars they should be high mass - losing stars ; the formation of dust and , in consequence , infrared excess are expected .",
    "this excess can be measured with the flux ratio r@xmath44f(12 @xmath45m)/f(2.2 @xmath45 m ) .",
    "high mass - losing stars ( ie .",
    "tp - agb - stars ) typically show r@xmath46 . the large majority of our sample stars have r@xmath46 , tc - yes and tc - no stars being indistinguishable in the r parameter .",
    "we might conclude that probably all carbon stars in our sample are in fact of intrinsic nature and when they are classified as no - tc stars , this is just a consequence of the difficult and uncertain analysis of the tc i @xmath47  blend on which this study is based .",
