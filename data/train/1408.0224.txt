    "the effects of gravitational forces and magnetic fields have been recognized as playing an important role in the mass accretion process in a variety of astrophysical systems , including protostars , binaries containing compact objects , and massive galaxies with supermassive black holes . however , the consequences for accretion onto normal stars in close binary star systems are not as well understood . in this paper , we focus on binaries containing normal stars , specifically the algol - type binaries with prototype @xmath1 per ( algol ) , which are progenitors of the cataclysmic variables @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the cool star displays enhanced magnetic activity associated with rapid rotation induced by tidal synchronization of the binary system , and the resulting dynamic phenomena are many times more powerful than those found on the sun . since the cool star is the source of the mass transfer stream , then this enhanced activity will influence the mass transfer process in a direct way .    in the algols , no magnetic activity is linked to the hot b - a - type mass - gaining star @xcite . however , both gyrosynchrotron radio emission and thermal x - ray emission are expected from the cool f - k - type mass - losing companion , mostly due to coronal activity @xcite . additional evidence of magnetic activity can be derived from the spectra ( e.g. , caii h & k or h@xmath0 emission ) , however such evidence is typically sparse because these cool stars contribute only @xmath2 5 - 15% to the total luminosity of the binary , depending on wavelength , with the highest contribution in the infrared . moreover ,",
    "any magnetic components in the h@xmath0 line are masked by contributions from circumstellar gas flowing between and around the stars @xcite .",
    "these magnetic phenomena observed in algol binaries are similar to those detected in the double - cool star detached rs cvn binaries @xcite .",
    "the presence of an active magnetic field on the mass - losing star can lead to magnetic threading of the gas flow from the l1 point towards the mass - gaining star when the ram pressure of the accretion flow exceeds the magnetic stress at the l1 point @xcite . as a consequence , the magnetic field will be dragged along with the fluid flow and eventually surround the mass gainer .",
    "this process is associated with the superhump phenomenon , which typically arises from the prograde apsidal precession of an eccentric accretion disk and is usually identified in cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "superhumps were first detected in algol binaries by @xcite using 2.3 ghz and 8.3 ghz observations of @xmath1 per derived from the 5.6-year continuous radio flare survey of @xcite .",
    "this prediction of the superhump phenomenon in @xmath1 per was confirmed by @xcite using 15 ghz vlbi observations .",
    "astrometric methods have also been used to confirm the association between the source of the radio emission and the physical location of the k - type mass - losing star , with a precision of @xmath30.5 mas @xcite .",
    "indirect images of interacting binaries created with the aid of doppler tomography have led to a better understanding of the role played by gravitational forces and magnetic fields .",
    "this image reconstruction technique was introduced by @xcite and then applied to cataclysmic variables and x - ray binaries @xcite and also to direct - impact and long - period algol binaries @xcite .",
    "the images illustrate the movement of gas from the inner lagrangian point towards and around normal or compact mass - gaining stars , and show that a well - defined accretion disk is formed around the mass - gaining star in the compact binaries .",
    "however , in the _ direct - impact _ systems the mass gainer is a normal main sequence star , and the stars are very close to each other relative to the orbital separation .",
    "the first 2d tomography images of these latter systems have shown that the path of the flow is usually governed by gravitational and coriolis forces , and there is additional evidence that the active cool mass - losing star can have substantial influence on the mass transfer process @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the progress that has been made in 2d tomography of the direct - impact and long - period algols to identify patterns and similarities between systems with orbital periods from 1.2 days to 11.1 days ; some preliminary results have appeared in conference proceedings ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in  2 ,",
    "we describe the predicted dynamical behavior of the gravitational flow along the gas stream and beyond ; in  3 , we describe the technique of doppler tomography , and  4 provides the application to the direct - impact systems .",
    "we also examine the influence of various system properties on the 2d images in  5 , specifically the effects of orbital inclination , systemic velocity , orbital phase coverage , inadequate velocity resolution , and the effect of the gas opacity known as shadowing . in  6 , we describe the techniques that can be used to extract physical properties of the gas flows directly from the images via four methods : an s - wave analysis ; using hydrodynamic simulations to create simulated tomograms ; using synthetic spectra to model the contributions of the accretion disk , gas stream , and other sources of emission ; and using synthetic spectra with tomography to confirm visually that the separate accretion structures have been modeled accurately .",
    "the results and conclusions are given in  7 and  8 , respectively .",
    "the semidetached interacting algol binaries contain a cool f - k iii - iv secondary star which has expanded to fill its roche lobe and is transferring material through a gas stream onto a hot b - a v primary star ( the mass gainer ) ; in this context , the primary is the brighter and more massive star .",
    "a radius vs. mass ratio or @xmath4 diagram , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , can be used to predict the systems that should undergo direct impact of the gas stream onto the stellar photosphere .",
    "this figure also shows the roche geometries for the direct - impact systems and some wider binaries based on the properties listed in table [ tab1 ] , derived from @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the orbital period of the binary ; @xmath6 is the orbital inclination ; @xmath7 is the mass ratio of the binary ; @xmath8 is the radius of the mass gainer , @xmath9 , relative to the binary separation @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the velocity semi - amplitudes of the primary and secondary , respectively ; and @xmath13 is the systemic velocity of the binary . until these systems are resolved by an instrument with absolute phase angle calibration or direct imaging , the values of inclination will have an @xmath6 vs. @xmath14 ambiguity , corresponding to prograde vs. retrograde orbits . for the close binary in @xmath1 per",
    ", @xcite found that the orbit of the binary is retrograde , so the inclination should be @xmath15 .",
    "however , we retain the usual convention here with angles up to @xmath16 corresponding to prograde orbits .    in figure [ fig1 ] , the direct - impact binaries will be found above the solid curve labeled @xmath17 , corresponding to the radius of a stable accretion disk ( e.g. , @xmath18 lib , rz cas , u sge ) since the mass gainer is larger in size than the predicted disk radius .",
    "however , the wider binaries that always form a stable accretion disk ( e.g. , s cnc ) will be found below the dashed curve labeled @xmath19 , corresponding to the distance of closest approach of the gas stream , hence no impact is predicted since the size of the star is smaller than @xmath19 ; these curves are based on the semi - analytical ballistic calculations of @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that systems between the two curves may have a grazing impact between the gas stream and the mass gainer ( e.g. , s equ , sw cyg , cx dra ) while no impact is expected in other cases ( e.g. , tt hya ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the direct - impact systems typically have @xmath20 days @xcite while the grazing - impact systems have @xmath21 days .",

    "the assumption of synchronous rotation ( @xmath50 ) provides a relationship between the length and velocity scales that permits the locations of the stars to be plotted in the velocity frame .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also displays two large circles around the binary corresponding to the locus of a keplerian accretion disk in the velocity frame if that disk fills the space between the photosphere and the roche surface of the mass gainer ; the largest solid circle and the smaller dashed circle mark the inner and outer edge of the accretion disk , respectively ; and the plus sign marks the center of mass of the binary .    in both the cartesian and velocity frames ,",
    "the solid trajectory is the gravitational free - fall path of the gas stream from the l1 point under the influence of the coriolis force , in the frame of reference of the binary .",
    "the trajectory has been divided into ten parts marked by small solid circles to permit a visual comparison of the simultaneous position and velocity of a specific location along the gas stream trajectories .",
    "in addition , the large solid red circle and the extended blue region along the trajectory represent the median and range , respectively , of the predicted location of the stream - photosphere impact site .",
    "the values of the stream velocity at the impact site are listed under @xmath36 in the last column of table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the impact site was examined in greater detail by @xcite by calculating the ram pressure in the gas stream and the depth of the shock region relative to the stellar photosphere .",
    "the depth at which the shock forms is sensitive to the assumed valid of the mass transfer rate . over a range of mass transfer rates ,",
    "the stream reached a depth of @xmath51 below the photosphere to @xmath52 above the photoshere in the case of @xmath1 per , suggesting that most of the flow is reflected away from the shock region in this binary .",
    "the tangential component of the impact velocities listed in table [ tab2 ] can produce substantial differential rotation and redistribution of the gas flow around the mass gainer ; and observational evidence of such high rotational velocity regions was found in ultraviolet spectra by @xcite and at h@xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "the impact also produces heating of the gas to temperatures of @xmath53 k , and evidence of the shock region was detected as a high temperature accretion region in ultraviolet spectra @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is expected for the other direct - impact systems .",
    "so , purely in terms of gravitational and coriolis forces , the gas flow from the l1 point will make direct impact with the surface of the mass gainer in most of the systems under study .",
    "since the flow velocities are much higher than the synchronous velocity of the star , the impact should create an equatorial bulge on the surface of the star , and in a few cases , the gas may be expelled from the system .",
    "the conditions at the impact site will be turbulent , and the tangential component of the flow will propel the gas around the star well beyond the impact site on timescales of hours to days , until it reaches the location of the incoming gas stream .",
    "the image reconstruction technique of tomography can be implemented in two steps : ( 1 ) the acquisition of a set of views of the object at directions around the object over the 360@xmath54 range of angles ; these views are called slices or projections that can be represented mathematically by the radon transform @xcite . ( 2 ) the recovery of an image of the original object may be obtained through a summation process called back projection , accomplished by taking each image projection and returning it along the path from which it was acquired .",
    "the quality of the reconstruction depends on the number of views acquired and the angular distribution of these views . in general ,",
    "back - projection tomography uses ( @xmath55)-dimensional projections to calculate an @xmath56-dimensional image of an object ( e.g. , construct a 3d image using 2d projections , like cat scans in medicine ) .",
    "moreover , the technique is robust in that it can be applied to different types of measurements , for example : x - rays ( medicine or archaeology ) , radar ( satellite aperture radar - sar ) , sonar ( oceanography ) , seismic waves ( geophysics ) , and spectra ( astronomy ) .    tomography can be applied only if there exist different angular views of a system . for example , since the surface of venus is obscured by thick clouds and is opaque at optical wavelengths , the reconstruction of its surface was achieved at radio frequencies using radar data collected by the nasa magellan satellite which orbited the planet for four years from 1990 - 1994 .",
    "eclipsing binaries and rotating stars also provide us with changing views of the system and the reconstruction requires the use of spectra . in these latter cases ,",
    "the gas motions detected through doppler shifts of spectral lines are used to provide an image of the gas flows in velocity coordinates , so the technique is termed _",
    "doppler tomography_.    in two - dimensional back - projection doppler tomography , the radon transform of the function , @xmath57 , is a set of projections , @xmath58 representing the _ line profile _ , with doppler shift , @xmath59 , at each orbital phase , @xmath60 . @xmath61",
    "the reconstruction creates the 2d image @xmath57 directly from the 1d doppler shifts of the line profile by inverting the equation for the radon transform @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "this filtered back - projection formulation can be extended to the next dimension to calculate @xmath64 by changing @xmath58 to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the orbital inclination , setting @xmath67 , and integrating over @xmath68 .",
    "the 3d case reverts to the 2d case for @xmath69 , corresponding to total eclipses , compared to partial eclipses for lower inclinations .",
    "moreover , while orbital inclinations close to @xmath70 are preferred for 2d reconstructions , inclinations close to @xmath71 are optimal for 3d reconstructions @xcite .",
    "the application of doppler tomography requires one main assumption , namely that the line profiles are broadened only by doppler motions ; which is a good first order approximation , although turbulent motions may contribute ( see @xcite and the extensive discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we need numerous spectra distributed around the orbit of the binary , with high wavelength resolution and adequate coverage in orbital phase .",
    "the technique has been applied to spectra that are dominated by emission , but the generality of the equations suggests that the method may also be applied with prudence to absorption spectra .    in practice",
    ", tomography is a summation process and the velocity images are calculated by summing the normalized intensities of the spectra for all velocity pixels after they have been converted to the separate @xmath72 and @xmath73 components , and then sweeping through all phases around the orbit . in the calculation ,",
    "the doppler shifts typically range from -800 to + 800 km relative to the rest wavelength of the line ( e.g. h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the images are constructed in the velocity domain and can only be converted to the cartesian domain if the separate velocity fields of all accretion structures ( e.g. , gas stream , accretion disk , etc . )",
    "are known .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] illustrates the full orbit data collection procedure in the case of u crb , with 294 phases over several epochs .",
    "a representative set of these spectra for epoch 1994 were stacked in order of orbital phase from 0.0 to 1.0 in preparation for the summation calculation .",
    "since the spectra of the direct - impact systems are usually dominated by absorption near primary eclipse ( @xmath74 ) , these eclipse spectra were typically excluded from the analysis for these systems .",
    "the tomography calculations were implemented using both fortran and c++ codes with matlab as the platform for creating the plots of the images .",
    "the speed of the code depends sensitively on the number of orbital phases multiplied by the velocity resolution of the spectrum in pixels .",
    "doppler tomography has been applied to eclipsing systems which contain white dwarfs and neutron stars ( e.g. , cataclysmic variables or cvs , nova - like systems , and soft x - ray binaries ) , as well as non - compact main sequence stars ( e.g. , algol binaries )",
    ". the main differences between these systems are : ( 1 ) the accretion structures in the compact systems are bright relative to the stars , while the structures in the algols are faint relative to the luminous main sequence mass - gaining star ; and ( 2 ) the large size of the mass gainer in the algols leads to the direct impact of the gas stream onto the stellar surface in the short - period algols , while this type of impact does not occur in the long - period algols or in compact systems . hence",
    ", composite accretion structures should form in the short - period algols compared to the classical accretion disks that have been detected in other systems . in all cases ,",
    "the cool magnetically - active mass - losing star is expected to influence the resulting accretion structures .",
    "numerous time - resolved spectra of the target systems are required for the tomography calculation in order to recover a well - resolved image of the gas flows ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "images are usually created from spectral lines in the optical regime since the expected gas temperatures are @xmath75k . however , since the h@xmath0 line is saturated in the spectra of cvs and x - ray binaries , relatively weaker lines have been used , e.g. , he i @xmath765015 , he ii @xmath764686 , h@xmath1 .",
    "many doppler tomograms have been created for cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite for smc x-1 and her x-1 ) , and the nova - like binary v3885 sgr @xcite .",
    "the first tomogram of a black - hole candidate , cyg x-1 , was made by @xcite .",
    "most of the direct - impact algol binaries have weak emission - line spectra , so the emission from non - photospheric gas can be enhanced by subtracting the composite spectrum of the stars from the observed spectrum to create a difference spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this subtraction process assumes that the circumstellar gas is optically thin , which is a good first order approximation .",
    "however , this assumption can be examined by comparing the tomography images derived separately from the observed and difference spectra ( see section 6 ) . for the direct - impact systems ,",
    "tomograms have been made predominantly from the h@xmath0 line , and other images have been constructed from the h@xmath1 , he i @xmath766678 , and si ii @xmath766371 lines ( e.g. , cx dra ; @xcite ) , and also from the si iv @xmath761063,1073 doublet and si iv @xmath761394 line in the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "table [ tab3 ] provides a summary of spectra of algol binaries ( epochs 1976 to 2003 ) that were processed into images , and it lists the number of orbits , n(orbits ) , the number of phases , n(phi ) , and the velocity resolution of the spectra , n(vel ) .",
    "these data were derived primarily from the extensive database of direct - impact systems described by @xcite for which the spectra have high signal - to - noise ( typically s / n @xmath77 ) , high wavelength resolution ( see table [ tab3 ] ) , and coverage of the entire orbit of each binary ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "this latter result is surprising given that the mass - losing star contributes a small fraction of the total luminosity of the binary ( only 5 - 15% , depending on wavelength ) , and it was considered to be relatively unimportant in the mass transfer process , besides being the source of the gas flow through the l1 point .",
    "the sources of h@xmath0 emission seen in the 2d images are described below : ( 1 ) _ a source of magnetic activity associated with the cool mass - losing star _ , including emission from the chromosphere , prominences , flares , and coronal mass ejections .",
    "the tomogram of v711 tau illustrated that the emission from the cool star has the same velocity as that star .",
    "this type of emission was detected in almost all systems , including rz cas , @xmath18 lib , @xmath1 per , tx uma , u sge , s equ , u crb , rs vul , cx dra , and au mon ; the exceptions were rw tau , sw cyg , and tt hya .",
    "the byproducts of magnetic activity revealed in the velocity images of so many systems should not be surprising since the mass - losing stars have spectral types from f0 to k2 and there is independent evidence of magnetic activity in these systems @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) _ a gas stream along the predicted gravitational trajectory _",
    "( e.g. , rz cas , @xmath18 lib , rw tau , @xmath1 per , tx uma , u sge , s equ , u crb , rs vul , cx dra , au mon ) . in most of these systems , the gas stream flows along or close to the predicted gravitational trajectory .",
    "the exception is tx uma in which the stream path appears to be deflected during epochs 1992 and 1994 but not during epoch 1993 .",
    "it is interesting also that the emission associated with the cool star is weaker during epoch 1993 relative to the other epochs .",
    "tx uma is known to be magnetically active @xcite , and therefore , it should not be surprising that enhanced magnetic activity in the form of prominences or coronal mass ejections could deflect the gas stream flow away from the expected gravitational trajectory .    with increased room between the stars",
    ", the gas stream can make its way around the mass - gaining star to form a transient or stable accretion disk ( e.g. , tt hya and au mon ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ a star - stream impact region _ where the gas stream strikes the surface of the mass - gaining star .",
    "the expected location of this shock region was discussed in section 2 and shown in figure [ fig2 ] for different values of the size of the mass gainer . in most cases ,",
    "the shock should occur close to the intersection of the gas stream path and the circle representing the keplerian velocity of the mass gainer .",
    "extended emission at this location is visible in the velocity images for u sge ( epoch 1993 ) , u crb ( epoch 1993 ) , and s equ .",
    "\\(4 ) _ a bulge of extended absorption or emission around the mass - gaining star _ produced by the impact of the high velocity stream onto the slowly rotating photosphere ( e.g. , rz cas , @xmath18 lib , tx uma ( epochs 1992 and 1994 ) , u sge ( both epochs ) , s equ , u crb ( both epochs ) , and rs vul ) .",
    "this is the same region as the circumprimary bulge detected via photometry as a hot band around the equator of the mass gainer ( e.g.,rz cas @xcite ; u sge @xcite ) .",
    "the impact increases the rotational velocity of the star beyond the synchronous value @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies of tx uma by @xcite and @xcite also found that the mass - gainer in this binary rotates @xmath80 times the synchronous velocity as a result of the impact .",
    "so , the images have confirmed the photometric and spectroscopic evidence of the circumprimary bulge .",
    "\\(5 ) _ a transient or permanent accretion disk _ around the mass - gaining star .",
    "accretion disks were found in all systems with @xmath81 ( e.g. , sw cyg , cx dra , tt hya , au mon ) .",
    "disks were also found in u sge ( epoch 1994 ) and u crb ( epoch 1994 ) , however the gas distribution in these two systems can be transformed from a disk - like state to a stream - like state within a few orbital cycles .",
    "the evidence of this variability can be seen in the trailed spectrograms and in the individual spectra through the change from a double - peaked profile to a single - peaked profile .",
    "\\(6 ) _ an absorption zone _ where the gas flows are seen in absorption ( e.g. , u sge , s equ , u crb , rs vul , sw cyg , cx dra ) . a tomogram created from the siiv @xmath761394 line of u sge",
    "is seen in figure [ fig7 ] and shows that the main source of emission in the ultraviolet overlaps with the absorption zone , which in turn represents the locus of hotter gas ( @xmath82k ) .",
    "\\(7 ) _ a disk - stream impact region _ where the circling gas strikes the incoming stream and is slowed by the impact ( e.g. , rw tau , @xmath1 per , tx uma , u sge , s equ , u crb , rs vul , cx dra ) . the result is a region of emission nearly along the line of centers with velocities lower than that of a keplerian disk , i.e. , within the locus of the disk in the velocity image .",
    "therefore , in the systems with @xmath83 , except for sw cyg , after the gas stream strikes the star it has enough angular momentum to flow around the star until it comes in contact with the incoming stream . in these systems , the density of the gas stream must be higher than the density of the gas that has circled the mass gainer .",
    "this region has been called the localized region ( e.g. , @xmath1 per , @xcite ; rw tau , @xcite ; other systems , @xcite ) . in wider binaries ,",
    "the gas stream makes a more grazing impact and forms a more extensive flow in an accretion disk , so it is more difficult to determine where the disk intersects with the incoming stream in the velocity image .",
    "a pictorial representation of the variety of emission sources is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "this figure illustrates that the gas stream emission was sufficiently bright to be detected in the images of most systems .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] summarizes the transition in the line profile at quadrature , the emission sources in the velocity image , and the trailed spectrogram , with increasing binary separation ( semi - major axis , @xmath10 ) . the progression from the upper to lower parts of this figure",
    "illustrate the transformation from the _ stream state _ to the _ disk state_. in essence , the closest binaries ( e.g. , @xmath18 lib ) typically display only emission associated with the mass - losing star , and hence evidence of magnetic activity , because there is insufficient room for the gas stream to make its way around the mass gainer .",
    "if there is some extra room between the stars , the gas stream can progress farther along , and we find evidence of extended gas streams along the projected gravitational path in several systems ( e.g. , s equ , rs vul , u sge , u crb ) . in the widest systems ( e.g. , tt hya , au mon ) , there is sufficient room to form a keplerian accretion disk . over the range of systems ,",
    "the line profile at quadrature shows a progression from nearly single - peaked profiles indicative of gas streams in the closest systems ( smaller @xmath10 ) , to distinct double - peaked profiles indicative of accretion disks in the wider systems ( larger @xmath10 ) .",
    "potential variability in the images was examined in four systems for which data were collected at multiple epochs ( i.e. , @xmath1 per , tx uma , u crb , u sge ) , although data were also collected over an extensive range of epochs for cx dra , tt hya , and au mon .",
    "the images of @xmath1 per suggest that this system was relatively stable over many orbital cycles ( epochs 1976 to 1994 ) , however there was a slight change in the direction of the gas stream in tx uma between epochs 1992 and 1994 , suggesting the influence of magnetic activity on the cool star in that system ( see earlier discussion in section 4.1 ) .",
    "in addition , u crb and u sge are unusual because they display both stream - like and disk - like states at different epochs ( see figure [ fig6 ] and section 4.1 ) , and a closer examination of their spectra suggest that these binaries may alternate regularly between the two states .",
    "consequently , u crb and u sge have been designated as _",
    "alternating systems _ , and the source of the variability may be linked to magnetic activity on the mass - losing star ( see @xcite and the discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "the images of accretion disks in the wide grazing - impact systems are similar to those of the cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) . hence , stable accretion disks are found in binaries containing both compact and main sequence mass gainers .",
    "multiwavelength spectra of algol binaries have been collected at wavelengths 4800   @xmath25 6700  , including the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , he i @xmath766678 , and si ii @xmath766371 lines .",
    "in addition , ultraviolet spectra of 17 algol binaries can be found in the iue archives from epochs 1978 to 1996 .",
    "the first ultraviolet image of u sge was derived from the si iv @xmath761394 doublet ( epoch 1983 - 1994 ) after the contribution of the stars was extracted from the spectra .",
    "figure [ fig7](a ) shows that the si iv emission overlaps with the absorption zone identified in the h@xmath0 image for epoch 1993 , and can be interpreted as the locus of gas that was heated beyond the @xmath86k regime associated with h@xmath0 to temperatures of @xmath87k in the uv region @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig7](b ) displays the multiwavelength images of cx dra , and demonstrates that the he i @xmath766678 and si ii @xmath766371 emission arise from an extended accretion disk , while the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission arise primarily from a compact region where the gas stream strikes the outer edge of the disk @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of the gas flows can be obtained when images are constructed for different temperature regimes .",
    "the attractiveness of tomography is that it is a robust technique ; however it is useful to discover how various criteria influence the resulting 2d image constructed from the back - projection technique .",
    "it should be noted that the tomograms shown in figure 4 were computed without any filtering , smoothing , denoising or other regularization of the images . the only additional processing was to interpolate the images in orbital phase to reduce the radial spoke - like streaks produced by the back - projection procedure when there are gaps in orbital phase . in spite of the minimal processing ,",
    "the amount of detail manifested in the images is truly remarkable .    in this section",
    ", we examine the effects of ( 1 ) orbital inclination , ( 2 ) systemic velocity , ( 3 ) orbital phase coverage , ( 4 ) velocity resolution , and ( 5 ) shadowing on the tomography results .      the effects of adopting different values of orbital inclination are shown in figure [ fig8 ] for a direct - impact binary ( e.g. , u crb ) and a wider binary ( e.g. , tt hya ) .",
    "the main result is that the image size decreases as the inclination increases from @xmath88 to @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , the measured inclinations of u crb ( @xmath89 ) and tt hya ( @xmath90 ) lead to images that are consistent with the template of predicted locations for the gas stream and disk in the velocity frame .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates the effect of adopting a systemic velocity for the binary , @xmath13 , that is inconsistent with the measured value ; the result is a distortion of the image .",
    "the example cases of u crb and tt hya have systemic velocities of @xmath91 km and @xmath92 km , respectively , and the corresponding 2d images are therefore similar to the image for @xmath93 km .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates the effect of phase coverage on the resulting 2d image using two subsets the u crb and tt hya data .",
    "the images were made from three sets of data : a subset of the full dataset ( left frame ) , after this subset was interpolated to create a grid of 100 evenly - spaced phases ( middle frame ) , and the full dataset ( right frame ) .",
    "insufficient orbital phase coverage creates radial spoke - like streaks across the diagram .",
    "however , an interpolation in orbital phase adequately represents the outcome when the full dataset is used to construct the image .",
    "the resolution of the h@xmath0 line was typically 0.17  / pixel ( n(vel ) = 275 ) and was as fine as 0.09  / pixel ( n(vel ) = 503 ) .",
    "since the wavelength or velocity resolution of the spectra is already very high , an increase in the resolution does not result in any significant improvement in the resulting 2d image .",
    "however , poor wavelength resolution in the spectrum would lead to a coarser image .",
    "the effect of shadowing results when the passage of light through a medium is obstructed because of the opacity of the medium .",
    "hence , the view from one direction may not be identical to that from the opposite direction @xmath94 away . a similar effect called an acoustic shadow in radar tomography occurs when radio waves fail to propagate due to some topological obstruction , or in medical tomography because of the attenuation of light by denser parts of the medium @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows images produced from data at phases @xmath95 ( left ) , @xmath96 ( middle ) , and the complete data set ( right ) to check for the effect of shadowing in the example cases of u crb and tt hya .",
    "the rough resemblance between the images derived from half the orbit and that from the full orbit suggest that shadowing , if it exists , does not play a significant factor in the resulting tomograms . instead , the uneven sampling of the data for each half orbit and the number of spectra in each dataset have larger effects on the resulting image .    an alternative way to examine the opacity of the medium is to compare the tomograms derived from the observed and difference spectra , since the subtraction of the stellar spectra from the observed spectrum assumes that the circumstellar gas is optically thin . in the case of cx dra ,",
    "the observed and difference h@xmath0 images shown in figure [ fig7](b ) are not similar in appearance , which suggests that the circumstellar gas in cx dra was not optically thin .",
    "however , there is evidence from similar comparisons that the circumstellar gas is optically thin in tt hya and au mon ( see section 6.3 ) , in agreement with the results of the shadowing test for tt hya ( figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the 2d velocity images have provided visual confirmation of the existence of both gravitational and magnetic structures in the direct - impact and grazing - impact algol binaries . in addition , the physical properties of the gas flows can be derived from the data and images using ( 1 ) an analysis of the s - wave patterns in the trailed spectrograms , ( 2 ) the creation of simulated tomograms derived from hydrodynamic simulations , ( 3 ) the computation of synthetic spectra of the accretion structures , and ( 4 ) a systematic extraction of the separate accretion structures using synthetic spectra with tomography .",
    "these procedures require substantial effort and we present here some examples of the results that have been achieved so far .",
    "these results have enhanced our interpretation and understanding of the gas flows in both the velocity and cartesian frames .",
    "the trailed spectra of the direct - impact binaries display one or two sinusoidal patterns called _ s - waves _ which represent the orbital radial velocity variations of the emission peaks ( see figures 4 and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "these patterns can be used to identify the locations of the most intense sources of emission in the velocity image .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows that the h@xmath0 emission peaks roughly follow the velocity curves of the stars , sometimes with a smaller amplitude , in direct - impact systems when they are in the stream state ( e.g. , @xmath18 lib , rw tau , @xmath1 per , u sge , s equ , u crb , rs vul ) .",
    "however , the emission peaks appear to be independent of the velocity curves when the gas is in a disk state ( e.g. , tt hya ) .    in the direct - impact binaries , the larger variation is associated with the mass - losing star so the ratio of velocity semi - amplitudes of the mass loser and the s - wave source should be the same as the ratio of their distances from the center of mass . as a result , this s - wave source is located at a distance @xmath97 from the c.m . of the binary , where @xmath98 is the velocity semi - amplitude of the mass loser , @xmath99 is the distance of the mass loser from the c.m . of the binary , and",
    "@xmath100 is the velocity semi - amplitude of the s - wave .",
    "a similar argument follows for the other s - wave associated with the mass - gaining star .",
    "s - wave analyses for @xmath1 per ( epochs 1976 - 1977 ) and cx dra ( epochs 1975 - 1998 ) have identified the location of the most intense sources of h@xmath0 emission in these binaries .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] illustrates the dominant s - wave solution in the velocity frame ( large red dot ; left frame ) , the s - wave superimposed on the trailed spectrum ( middle frame ) , and the predicted source of the dominant s - wave in the cartesian frame ( large red dot ; right frame ) for these binaries .    for the case of @xmath1 per ( epoch 1976 - 1977 ) ,",
    "the source of the dominant s - wave was located nearly along the line of centers between the stars , with coordinates @xmath101 km relative to the center of mass of the binary @xcite .",
    "the corresponding source in cartesian coordinates was found at a distance @xmath102 compared to the location of the @xmath103 point at @xmath104 from the c.m . of the binary , for @xmath105 km and @xmath106 .",
    "this source is consistent with the location of the localized region in the cartesian map predicted by @xcite .",
    "the analysis of cx dra ( epochs 1975 - 1998 ) identified the dominant s - wave source at @xmath107 km relative to the c.m .",

    "of the binary compared to @xmath110 = @xmath111 , for @xmath112 km and @xmath113 .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the position of the s - wave source relative to the predicted locus of the accretion disk derived from the hei @xmath766678 line ( shown in figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this s - wave solution is consistent with the h@xmath0 velocity image and suggests that the h@xmath0 emission along the gas stream path was interrupted by the presence of a slightly hotter accretion disk .",
    "hence , this source represents the location of the _ stream - disk impact site or `` hot spot '' _ and should be added to the list of seven emission sources described in section 4.1 .",
    "similar analyses can be performed for other systems .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations are useful in the study of accretion flows because they illustrate the evolution of the flow under a variety of initial conditions , and can be used to constrain the properties of the gas flows derived from spectroscopic analysis . these simulations can be used to model the h@xmath0 emissivity and to study the evolution of the flow simultaneously in spatial and velocity dimensions .",
    "this was achieved by @xcite for two algol binaries : @xmath1 per and tt hya , which span the range from direct - impact to disk - state systems .",
    "they used the vh1 ( virginia hydrodynamics-1 ) 2d hydrodynamics code , which incorporates the effects of gravity and coriolis forces , and assumes optically - thin radiative cooling of the gas ; no magnetic effects were included in these simulations .    for each binary",

    "similarly , the gas stream and disk are substantially brighter in tt hya at the higher density .",
    "the similarity between the h@xmath0 doppler tomograms of the alternating systems at different epochs ( specifically u crb and u sge ) and the simulated tomograms of @xmath1 per at the two densities suggest that the variable and alternating behavior of the gas flows may be associated with changes in the density of the gas stream , and hence with changes in the mass transfer rate @xcite . moreover , since the change between stream state and disk state in u crb and u sge can occur within days , which is much shorter than the kelvin - helmholtz timescales listed in table [ tab2 ] , @xcite proposed that the alternating behavior may be triggered by flaring activity on the mass - losing star and could be associated with magnetic activity on the cool star .    the significant flaring cycles for @xmath1 per ( a direct - impact system ) and for v711 tau and",

    "this survey demonstrated that radio flares from @xmath1 per occurred with a predictable cycle of 49 days , which could result in sporadic mass ejections through the l1 point on that timescale .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the change in the image could result from the interaction between the incoming gas stream and the gas that has circled the star since the variability timescale of days is comparable to the circularization timescale @xmath119 ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .    in the case of tt hya",

    "in addition , @xcite used the code to examine the effects of various free parameters and how double - peaked emission from an accretion disk is formed .",
    "they found that the overall strength of the emission is influenced mainly by the density and temperature of the disk , while the position and separation of the emission peaks are influenced by the outer disk radius , the inclination , and the radial density profile .",
    "furthermore , the depth of the central absorption in the profile is very sensitive to the temperature , inclination , geometry , and dynamics of the disk .",
    "the shellspec code was used to sequentially model the composite synthetic spectra of the ( i ) stars , ( ii ) stars and disk , ( iii ) stars , disk , and gas stream , or ( iv ) stars , disk , gas stream , and spot ( e.g. , localized region ) .",

    "the velocity images produced via tomography display seven distinct sources of emission that provide evidence of both gravitational and magnetic effects ( figure [ fig5 ] ) : ( i ) a source of magnetic activity associated with the cool mass - losing star , including emission from the chromosphere , prominences , flares , and coronal mass ejections ; ( ii ) a gas stream along the predicted gravitational trajectory , which was identified in the images of nearly all of the systems in our survey ; ( iii ) a star - stream impact region where the gas stream strikes the surface of the mass - gaining star ; ( iv ) a bulge of extended absorption or emission around the mass - gaining star produced by the impact of the high velocity stream onto the slowly rotating photosphere ; ( v ) a transient or permanent accretion disk around the mass - gaining star ; ( vi ) an absorption zone which may be the locus of hotter gas beyond the @xmath86 k regime associated with h@xmath0 emission ; and ( vii ) a disk - stream impact region where the circling gas strikes the incoming stream and is slowed by the impact to sub - keplerian velocities .",
    "in addition , ( viii ) a hot spot where the gas stream strikes an already well - formed disk was found in one system by means of s - wave analysis .",
    "the images , trailed spectrograms , and representative spectra at quadrature provide us with a consistent progression from the stream state to the disk state when the binaries are displayed in order of increasing orbital separation ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this progression reveals the existence of the alternating systems which have been found in both the stream state and the disk state at different epochs .",
    "in addition , the multiwavelength spectra provide us with views of the gas flows at different temperatures ( e.g. , h@xmath0 vs. he i spectra ; figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "\\(4 ) we examined the influence of various system properties on the resulting 2d velocity images ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "orbital inclination causes the image size to decrease as the inclination increases from @xmath88 to @xmath70 .",
    "the adoption of an inaccurate systemic velocity results in the distortion of the image .",
    "insufficient orbital phase coverage creates radial spoke - like streaks across the diagram which can be rectified if the data are interpolated in orbital phase .",
    "inadequate velocity resolution across the spectrum can also be addressed by interpolation , but the observed spectra used in the analysis already have high resolution and do not require any interpolation",
    ". finally , shadowing , or the presence of partially opaque gas , will influence the passage of light through a medium and this effect can be noticed if we view the binary from opposite directions .",
    "this latter effect was not detected in u crb or tt hya ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "however , non - transparent gas was detected through a comparison between the observed and difference spectra of cx dra .",
    "\\(5 ) finally , we summarized four methods that have been used to extract the physical properties and other characteristics of the gas flows directly from the velocity images : ( a ) s - wave analysis ; ( b ) creation of simulated velocity tomograms from hydrodynamic simulations ; c ) sequential extraction of the separate emission sources using synthetic spectra of the disk , gas stream , and other sources of emission such as the localized region ; and ( d ) using synthetic spectra with tomography to confirm that the separate accretion structures have been modeled accurately .",
    "\\(a ) a comparison of the trailed spectrograms with the velocity curves of the stars showed that there are compact structures within the gas flow that nearly follow the velocity curve of one of the stars ; the orbital variation of these s - waves can be used to derive the location of the source in both the velocity and cartesian frames .",
    "hence , the s - wave analysis provides a means by which the information in the velocity map can be translated onto the cartesian frame without knowledge of the composite velocity fields in the tomogram ( figures [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) the construction of simulated tomograms from hydrodynamic calculations under controlled conditions provide a tool for comparison with the doppler tomograms derived from the observations , and provide a direct connection between the geometry and dynamics of the accretion flows in both velocity and cartesian dimensions under these controlled conditions ( figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the simulated tomograms permitted an interpretation of the alternating behavior of u crb and u sge as due to periodic changes in the density of the gas stream , and hence in the mass transfer rate .",
    "results from a radio flare survey suggest that the timescale of variability in radio flares from magnetically - active algol binaries is comparable to that of the alternating systems , and hence the alternating behavior may be triggered by magnetic activity on the cool mass - losing star .",
    "\\(c ) the code has been used effectively to compute synthetic spectra in moving transparent or non - transparent 3d structures such as a disk , stream , spot , jet , or shell , in addition to the stars .",
    "it can be used to sequentially model the composite synthetic spectra of combinations of these structures ( e.g. , stars , disk , and gas stream ) for comparison with the observed spectra . as a result , critical physical parameters , including the mass transfer rate , of these structures have been obtained for tt hya and au mon with this code .",
    "these parameters are needed to compute accurate stellar evolution models .",
    "\\(d ) in combination with tomography , the synthetic spectra have been used to visually confirm the quality of the computed model .",
    "this procedure has led to the discovery of asymmetric accretion disks in tt hya and au mon , as well as the isolation of a sub - keplerian velocity region and a localized region in au mon .",
    "the multi - tiered analysis performed in this work involved both theoretical tools and spectroscopic observations of algol binaries from the stream state to the disk state .",
    "this analysis has provided observational evidence of the effects of gravitational forces on the accretion flows in these interacting binaries . moreover ,",
    "we have used images derived from 2d doppler tomography to identify associations with magnetic activity of the cool star , which is the source of the accretion flow .",
    "these associations are distinct from the effects of gravitational effects on the gas flows and demonstrate that magnetic effects can not be ignored in any of these interacting binary star systems .",
    "the evidence is in the form of ( i ) chromospheric emission with the same velocity as that of the mass - losing star arising from prominences , flares , and coronal mass ejections , and this emission was detected in 11 of the 13 systems studied ; ( ii ) detection of a gas stream deflected from the predicted gravitational trajectory ( e.g. , tt hya ) ; and ( iii ) alternating behavior between stream state and disk state possibly caused by flaring activity ( e.g. , u sge , u crb ) .",
    "the extension to 3d doppler tomography is beginning to provide additional evidence of the influence of magnetic activity on the gas flows beyond the central orbital plane of the binary .",
    "the spectra employed in this study were used to calculate 3d tomograms of three systems : u crb , rs vul , and @xmath1 per @xcite .",
    "these 3d images suggest that magnetic threading of the gas , the superhump phenomenon , may alter the direction and intensity of the gas flow in the cases of rs vul and @xmath1 per , and may be responsible for deflecting the gas stream away from the central plane to produce a tilted accretion disk in u crb @xcite .",
    "these magnetic effects were mimicked using 3d hydrodynamic simulations by boosting the magnitude of the gas stream velocity to mach 30 and by deflecting the initial gas stream at the l1 point by 45@xmath24 from the orbital plane in u crb and rs vul @xcite .",
    "these simulations concluded that a deflected stream is a viable mechanism for producing the strong out - of - plane flows seen in the 3d tomographic images .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this research involved undergraduate students ( jf , mc ) and a graduate student ( ac ) , and it was partially supported by national science foundation grants ast-0908440 and dms-1309808 , and by the institut fr angewandte mathematik , ruprecht - karls - universitt heidelberg , germany ."
