    "the study of high gluon density qcd , pioneered in the mv model @xcite , has become a fashionable subject both due to its theoretical relevance and to eventual applications to small-@xmath2 dis or high - energy nuclear collisions ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the main outcome of these studies was the jimwlk equation which controls the evolution of the colour distribution of a hadron with increasing energy . in the last 3 years",
    ", the limitations of such evolution equation have become apparent in the form of the discussion of fluctuations and pomeron loops , see the reviews @xcite . in all available schemes , a separation of scales is considered between fast partons which act as sources for the classical dynamics of the soft , slow glue .",
    "considering gluon radiation and the arbitrariness of the fast - slow separation led to a renormalization group equation , the jimwlk equation . a powerful framework to derive this equation ,",
    "in which its limitations become apparent , is the wave function approach ( wfa ) @xcite which we briefly introduce in this section , see full details in @xcite .    in the wfa",
    "the evolution is introduced in the wave function of the projectile scattering off a hadronic target .",
    "this wave function is the superposition of fast gluons with @xmath3 .",
    "the scattering matrix with the target is the superposition of independent scattering matrices @xmath4 .",
    "then , an average over target configurations is taken , @xmath5=\\langle \\psi^i(y)|\\psi^f(y)\\rangle , \\qquad \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = \\int ds \\,\\sigma[s]\\,w_y[s],\\ ] ] with @xmath6 $ ] the probability density for the target to have a certain configuration of the fields .",
    "after a boost @xmath7 , the wave functions become @xmath8 with @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 the projectile density operator and @xmath12 the weizscker - williams fields of the projectile ( ww ) determined from the classical yang - mills equations of motion ( eoms ) , in which the hard gluons enter as an external source .    the resulting evolution equation is @xmath13/\\delta y=\\chi\\ , \\sigma[s]$ ] , with the kernel given by @xmath14 , \\label{kerb}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 depends on @xmath15 and @xmath16 are left ( right ) colour rotation operators , whose action in the dipole model limit , with the projectile composed of colour dipoles @xcite , is illustrated in . with the eoms solved at lowest order in @xmath17 in the @xmath18 gauge @xcite ,",

    "two limitations of the derivation leading to jimwlk are apparent : first , is an approximation only valid for a low - density projectile .",
    "second , the solution of the eoms is done at the lowest order in the density of the projectile , . in this section",
    "we explore the corrections to the latter by going to order @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xmath24 . with this expression the expansion of the kernel",
    "becomes @xmath25 whose leading term is the jimwlk kernel @xmath26 , \\label{kjimwlk}\\ ] ] with the @xmath27 s and @xmath4 depending on @xmath15 , and the first correction reads @xmath28\\nonumber   \\\\ & & -2f^{acd}(\\partial_i x)(y\\!\\parf\\ !",
