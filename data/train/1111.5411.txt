    "for a couple of decades , the heavy - quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) has been known to be very powerful theoretical tool to investigate various heavy mesons and baryons , including the charm and bottom quarks  @xcite .",
    "hqeft has been well tested in comparison with experiments for those heavy particles by the various collaborations , such as d@xmath7  @xcite , babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , bes  @xcite , and so on , and accumulated successful results .",
    "hqeft are based on two heavy - quark symmetries , i.e. spin and heavy - flavor ones . in general , they are not obvious in full qcd and become intact at @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the heavy - quark current mass . as easily understood , the theory contains a small expansion parameter @xmath10 so that qcd can be expanded systematically in terms of it .",
    "additionally , one usually defines the heavy - quark velocity @xmath11 , satisfying @xmath12 , which designates the velocity superselection rule  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - quark field can be redefined with @xmath11 by integrating out the irrelevant ( small ) component of the spinor . as a consequence , at the leading @xmath10 expansion",
    ", the free heavy - quark lagrangian manifests the spin and heavy - flavor symmetries . at the hadron level for instance , due to the spin symmetry",
    ", there appears mass degeneracy for spin-@xmath13 and spin-@xmath14 mesons with the same parity .",
    "interestingly , only a few percent deviation from the mass degeneracy has been observed in the real heavy - meson spectra  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - flavor symmetry becomes obvious as well , since the @xmath9 dependences are removed from the heavy - quark interactions at @xmath11 .",
    "many effective approaches have been made so far to study the heavy - light quark systems , such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons for instance , based on hqeft  @xcite .",
    "on top of hqeft , the light - quark components inside the heavy meson were treated in various ways . since the light - quarks are believed to be governed dominantly by spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) ,",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) type interactions were employed frequently , i.e. manifesting the chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown  @xcite .",
    "similarly , other nonperturbative qcd approaches were also taken into account to reserch the heavy - light quark systems : bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach  @xcite , relativistic quark model ( rqm )  @xcite , field - correlator method  @xcite , light - cone formalism  @xcite , qcd sum rule ( qcdsr )  @xcite , covariant chiral - perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , and so on .",
    "as the numerical evaluation of the first principles of qcd , a considerable number of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations were performed for the related subjects as well  @xcite .",
    "a mesonic effective interactions were developed for the heavy and light mesons with the flavor symmetry - breaking effects  @xcite .    among the physical observables to be addressed using these effective and lqcd approaches for the heavy - light systems ,",
    "the heavy - meson weak - decay constants for @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons have been investigated intensively as in the above references , since they are related deeply to the @xmath17 violation  @xcite as well as the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . moreover , the various decay modes for those heavy mesons , such as the ( non)leptonic decays , are of importance in understanding the heavy - light systems profoundly . we note that cleo collaboration have done various experiments for these physical quantities  @xcite , and the recent experimental data from cleo were analyzed carefully in refs .",
    "@xcite , giving an estimation @xmath18 mev . using the @xmath19 data from the belle  @xcite and barbar  @xcite collaborations , the value of @xmath2 was estimated by @xmath20 mev  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "considering the increasing interest on the heavy - light quark systems , we want to construct a _ new _ effective model for this subject .",
    "we note that the model is based on two ingredients in principle : hqeft and nonlocal chiral - quark model ( nlchqm )  @xcite for the heavy and light quarks , respectively . since hqeft has been explained briefly already , we focus on nlchqm here .",
    "it is worth mentioning that nlchqm defined in minkowski space is derived from the instanton - vacuum configuration .",
    "instantons have been believed to be one of the important agents responsible for sbcs in the low - energy region  @xcite .",
    "in the instanton model , the light quark acquires its effective mass @xmath21 mev , which is a consequence of the nontrivial interactions between the quarks and ( anti)instantons , as an indication of sbcs as well .",
    "those nontrivial interactions also give the momentum - dependency to the effective - quark mass , which plays the role of a natural uv regulator .",
    "there are only two intrinsic parameters in the instanton model : average ( anti)instanton size @xmath22 fm and inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath23 fm  @xcite .",
    "as long as we are staying at the su(2 ) light - flavor sector for @xmath24 quarks , these parameters are well determined phenomenologically and can reproduce various nonperturbative - qcd quantities qualitatively very well  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one of the distinctive features in the instanton model is the interactions between the light quarks and pseudoscalar ( ps ) meson , which takes part in the model by an appropriate su(2 ) bosonization process  @xcite , becomes nonlocal  @xcite .",
    "hence , nlchqm derived from the instanton model bears this distinctive feature naturally .    keeping these ingredients in mind",
    ", we pay attention to the the mass difference between the heavy meson and heavy quark . in the limit of the infinite heavy - quark current mass , @xmath8 , these two masses are the same .",
    "however , in reality , one observes they are differ from each other  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the heavy - meson mass can be regarded as the total sum of the various light and heavy quark masses , i.e. the effective and current ones . here",
    ", we assumed the chiral limit so that the light - quark current mass is neglected .",
    "below is an example for @xmath15-meson mass : @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) , we see that about @xmath26 mev mass must be generated additionally , even there is a certain value for the binding energy for the heavy meson . in this sense",
    ", we assume that this additionally necessary ( _ effective _ ) mass comes from the similar mechanism with the light quark , i.e. from the nontrivial contributions from the qcd vacuum .",
    "if this is the case , we take into account that the effective heavy - quark mass can possess a similar role as a uv regulator as that for the light quark .",
    "considering all these ingredients , we write an effective interactions ( action ) , based on the ideas of hqeft and nlchqm , extended to the heavy - light quark systems , i.e. extended nlchqm ( exnlchqm ) .    in order to test the validity of the present model",
    ", we compute the @xmath15- and @xmath16-meson weak - decay constants , taking into account their essential implications in physics as mentioned above , using exnlchqm .",
    "we choose all the model parameters from basic nlchqm for the light quarks which are the values for the renormalization scale and light - quark effective - quark mass at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the transferred momentum  @xcite . as for the momentum dependences of this mass",
    ", we try several possible different choices , as will be discussed in section ii .",
    "an unknown parameter from the heavy - quark side , i.e. the effective heavy - quark mass at @xmath27 is simply determined to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) with small light - quark current mass . as noticed ,",
    "since the effective masses are decreasing functions and play the roles of uv regulators , there is no need to include any adjustable free parameters by hand , such as the three - dimensional cutoffs .",
    "once we obtain the effective action of exnlchqm , it is an easy task to evaluate the decay constants via conventional functional treatments . from the numerical calculations , we obtain @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 mev , depending on different model parameters for the momentum dependences of the effective heavy and light quark masses as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmm ] ) in the next section .",
    "these values are in relatively good agreement with experimental data and various theoretical estimations . by increasing the renormalization scale for the heavy quark",
    ", we can obtain more compatible numerical results with the experimental data , which indicates that the heavy quarks make effects on the qcd vacuum to a certain extent , different from the light quark .",
    "we also discuss the vector heavy - meson weak - decay constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 in terms of the heavy - quark spin symmetry .",
    "it turns out that the ratios , @xmath29 are in @xmath30 , which are relatively smaller than those from other theoretical calculations .",
    "the present work is structured as follows : in section ii , we discuss how to formulate the effective model for the present purpose with brief explanations on hqeft and nlchqm . here , we also elucidate the parameters for the present model .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical results with relevant discussions .",
    "we close the present work with summary and future perspectives in the final section .",
    "in this section , we want to explain the motivation for exnlchqm and how to construct it based on hqeft and instanton physics .",
    "first , we briefly introduce hqeft following refs .  @xcite .",
    "the heavy - quark symmetry is fully satisfied in the limit of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the current - quark mass for the heavy - flavor su(2 ) quarks @xmath31 . since the top quark",
    ", whose mass is about a hundred times larger than these two quarks , we exclude it from the present discussions .",
    "conventionally , the heavy quark filed @xmath32 can be rewritten as a _ soft _ one @xmath33 with a definite velocity @xmath11  @xcite : @xmath34 where we define the light - like vector @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 . moreover , we write @xmath35 for definiteness , indicating that the heavy quark is at rest . using this definition of the heavy - quark field , the dirac equation for it",
    "can be modified as  @xcite @xmath36 taking into account the spin symmetry of hqeft , the pseudoscalar ( scalar ) and vector ( axial - vector ) mesons are grouped as a spin doublet @xmath37 @xmath38  @xcite : @xmath39 , \\,\\,\\,\\ , k\\equiv\\frac{1+\\rlap{/}{v}}{2}\\left[\\mathcal{s}+i\\mathcal{a}^\\mu\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5 \\right].\\ ] ] here , @xmath40 correspond to the fields of the ( scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector ) mesons , consisting of the quark contents @xmath41 minimally . in the present work",
    ", we will work with the su(2 ) light - flavor sector , i.e. @xmath42 . since we are interested in the weak - decay constants for the ps mesons , such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in order to test the present model , we will concentrate on the doublet field @xmath37 only hereafter .",
    "now , we take a look on the light - flavor sector .",
    "it has been well known that the light flavors are strongly governed by the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) . among the various chiral effective models ,",
    "the instanton - inspired models have accumulated successful achievements to investigate important nonperturbative qcd properties and hadrons  @xcite .",
    "based on the dilute - instanton model , the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nlchqm ) was developed and has been applied to many nonperturbative problems  @xcite . considering its successful applications so far , we will employ nlchqm for the light - flavor sectors .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian of the model has the form as follows : @xmath43q,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the current - quark and effective masses for the light quarks . according to the isospin symmetry , we choose @xmath46 mev throughout the present work  @xcite .",
    "note we do not consider the strange quark here whose mass is about @xmath47 mev  @xcite , so that the weak - decay constants for @xmath48 and @xmath49 will not be taken into account .",
    "the reason for the exclusion of the strange quark is as follows : the inclusion of the strange quark in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfl ] ) breaks the validity of the effective lagrangian in the leading @xmath50 contribution  @xcite . to remedy this problem",
    ", one needs to go over the leading @xmath50 contribution , and it turns out that the meson - loop corrections , corresponding to the large-@xmath50 corrections , are necessary to remedy the problem  @xcite .",
    "hence , we will confine ourselves to the su(2 ) light - flavor sector in the present work to avoid theoretical complexities .",
    "note that @xmath45 is generated from the nontrivial quark-(anti)instanton interactions in terms of the instanton physics , manifesting sbcs as well as the qcd - vacuum contributions  @xcite : @xmath51.\\ ] ] we have used the notation @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 stand for the modified bessel functions with the order @xmath55 .",

    "( [ eq : lfl ] ) , we want to emphasize on that the quark and ps meson interactions are momentum - dependent , i.e. nonlocal interaction , represented by the third term in the square bracket in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfl ] ) .",
    "taking into account all the ingredients discussed for the light and heavy sectors so far , now , we are in a position to extend this nlchqm to a system with the heavy - light quarks .",
    "our strategy for this purpose is as follows :    * we extend the flavor su(2 ) symmetries for @xmath24 and @xmath60 into that for su(4 ) , consisting of @xmath0 quarks . *",
    "the form of the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfl ] ) is assumed to be kept even for the flavor su(4 ) , manifesting momentum - dependent quark - ps meson couplings . *",
    "hence , the corresponding heavy ps mesons are represented by the nonlinear form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u5l ] ) .",
    "* we consider that the heavy quarks also possess their effective mass as the light one does .",
    "we will discuss this in detail soon .",
    "as has been known well , the flavor su(4 ) symmetry is strongly broken in reality , @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mesonic effective lagrangian was constructed in terms of the su(4 ) symmetry with the @xmath62 flavors , and the symmetry - breaking effects were taken into account by suppressing the virtual heavy - meson exchanges @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the light- and heavy - meson masses , respectively .",
    "being different from ref .",
    "@xcite , however , we are treating the quark degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) in the present work , and the symmetry breaking effects are included explicitly and microscopically by the current and effective masses for the heavy and light quarks , although the current heavy - quark mass will be subtracted from the resultant effective lagrangian by the heavy - quark symmetry  @xcite .",
    "note that the physical heavy - meson mass is used to compute the effective heavy - quark mass as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmmm ] ) as well as the numerical input as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) , manifesting the symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "moreover , the symmetry breaking effects in the present framework can be deduced from the different uv cutoff masses for the heavy and light sectors , as will be discussed in section iii .    upon this strategy ,",
