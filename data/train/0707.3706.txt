    "one of the most important experimental results from the desy electron - proton collider hera , working at a center of mass energy of about 300 gev , is the observation of a significant fraction , around @xmath0 , of large rapidity gap events in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . in these events ,",
    "the target proton emerges in the final state with a loss of a very small fraction ( @xmath1 ) of its energy - momentum @xcite .",
    "is the momentum fraction of the struck quark with respect to @xmath2 , and the bjorken variable @xmath3 its momentum fraction with respect to @xmath4.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we present this event topology , @xmath5 , where the virtual photon @xmath6 probes the proton structure and originates from the electron . then , the final hadronic state @xmath7 and the scattered proton are well separated in space ( or rapidity ) and a gap in rapidity can be observed in the event with no particle produced between @xmath7 and the scattered proton . in the standard qcd description of dis",
    ", such events are not expected in such an abundance since large gaps are exponentially suppressed due to color strings formed between the proton remnant and scattered partons ( see fig . [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "the theoretical description of these processes , also called diffractive processes , is a real challenge since it must combine perturbative qcd effect of hard scattering with nonperturbative phenomenon of rapidity gap formation @xcite .",
    "the name diffraction in high - energy particle physics originates from the analogy between optics and nuclear high - energy scattering . in the born approximation",
    "the equation for hadron - hadron elastic scattering amplitude can be derived from the scattering of a plane wave passing through and around an absorbing disk , resulting in an optic - like diffraction pattern for hadron scattering .",
    "the quantum numbers of the initial beam particles are conserved during the reaction and then the diffractive system is well separated in rapidity from the scattered hadron .",
    "the discovery of large rapidity gap events at hera has led to a renaissance of the physics of diffractive scattering in an entirely new domain , in which the large momentum transfer provides a hard scale .",
    "this observation has also revived the the rapidity gap physics with hard triggers , as large-@xmath8 jets , at the proton - antiproton collider tevatron , currently working at a center of mass energy of about 2 tev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite .        whether the existence of such hard scales makes the diffractive processes tractable within the perturbative qcd or not has been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental research during the past decade . in the following ,",
    "we describe the main ideas and results . using the standard vocable , the vaccum / colorless exchange involved in the diffractive interaction",
    "is called pomeron in this paper .",
    "the inclusive diffractive cross section has been measured at hera by h1 and zeus experiments over a wide kinematic range , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] .",
    "we observe that the diffractive cross section shows a hard dependence in the centre - of - mass energy of the @xmath9 system @xmath10 .",
    "namely , we get a behaviour of the form @xmath11 for the diffractive cross section , compatible with the dependence expected for a hard process .",
    "this first observation allows further studies of the diffractive process in the context of perturbative qcd .",
    ", differential in the mass of the diffractively produced hadronic system @xmath7 ( @xmath12 ) , is presented as a function of the centre - of - mass energy of the @xmath9 system @xmath10 .",
    "measurements at different values of the virtuality @xmath13 of the exchanged photon are displayed .",
    ", width=377,height=321 ]    r0.3        several theoretical formulations have been proposed to describe the diffractive exchange .",
    "the purpose here is to describe the `` blob '' displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) in a quatitative way , leading to a proper description of data shown in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] . among the most popular models ,",
    "the one based on a pointlike structure of the pomeron assumes that the exchanged object , the pomeron , is a colour - singlet quasi - particle whose structure is probed in the reaction . in this approach ,",
    "diffractive parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are derived from the diffractive dis cross sections in the same way as standard pdfs are extracted from dis measurements @xcite .",
    "it means that a certain flux of pomeron is emitted off the proton , depending on the variable @xmath1 , the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the proton lost during the interaction ( see fig . [ kin ] ) .",
    "then , the partonic structure of the pomeron is probed by the diffractive exchange ( see fig . [ fig1](a ) and [ kin ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ kin ] , we illustrate this factorisation property and remind the notations for the kinematic variables used in this paper , as the virtuality @xmath13 of the exchanged photon , the centre - of - mass energy of the @xmath9 system @xmath10 and @xmath12 the mass of the diffractively produced hadronic system @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that the bjorken variable @xmath3 verifies @xmath14 in the low @xmath3 of the h1/zeus measurements ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "also , the lorentz invariant variable @xmath16 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is equal to @xmath17 and can be interpreted as the fraction of longitudinal momentum of the struck parton in the ( resolved ) pomeron .",
    "this resolved pomeron model gives a good description of hera data but fails to describe the tevatron results .",
    "indeed , some underlying interactions can occur during the proton - antiproton collision , which break the gap in rapidity produced in the diffractive process @xcite .",
    "in the following , we focus our discussion on a different approach of diffractive interactions in which the the process is modeled with the exchange of ( at least ) two gluons projected onto the color singlet state ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) @xcite . in this model , the reaction follows three different phases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : ( i ) the transition of the virtual photon to the @xmath18 pair ( the color dipole ) at a large distance @xmath19 of about 10 - 100 fm for hera kinematics , upstream the target , ( ii ) the interaction of the color dipole with the target nucleon , and ( iii ) the projection of the scattered @xmath18 onto the the diffractive system @xmath7 .",
    "is presented as a function of @xmath16 for two values of @xmath13 .",
    "the different components of the two - gluon exchange model are displayed ( see text ) .",
    "they add up to give a good description of the data .",
    "the structure function @xmath20 is obtained directly from the measured diffractive cross section using the relation : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the inelasticity of the reaction.,width=453,height=245 ]    the inclusive diffractive cross section is then described with three main contributions @xcite .",
    "the first one describes the diffractive production of a @xmath23 pair from a transversely polarised photon , the second one the production of a diffractive @xmath24 system , and the third one the production of a @xmath23 component from a longitudinally polarised photon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figbekw ] , we show that this two - gluon exchange model gives a good description of the diffractive cross section measurements .",
    "one of the great interest of the two - gluon exchange approach is that it provides a unified description of different kind of processes measured in @xmath25 collisions at hera @xcite : inclusive @xmath26 , diffractive @xmath27 and ( diffractive ) exclusive vector mesons ( vm ) production @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ figunified ] ) . in the last case ,",
    "the step ( iii ) described above consists in the recombination of the scattered pair @xmath18 onto a real vm ( as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ... ) or onto a real photon for the reaction @xmath32 , which is called deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "r0.5        the dipole model then predicts a strong rise of the cross section in @xmath10 , which reflects the rise at small @xmath3 of the gluon density in the proton . indeed , in the two - gluon exchange model , the exclusive vm production cross section can be simply expressed as proportional to the square of the gluon density . at low @xmath3 ,",
    "the gluon density increases rapidly when @xmath3 decreases and therefore a rapid increase of the cross section with @xmath10 is expected and observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crossw ] ) .",
    "note that saturation effects , that are screening the large increase of the dipole cross section ( gluon density ) at low @xmath3 , are taken into account in recent developments of the dipole approach . also , skewing effects",
    "are included in models , i.e. the difference between the proton momentum fractions carried by the two exchanged gluons .",
    "the gluon density is then replaced by a generalized parton distribution , labeled @xmath33 in the following .",
    "the vm cross section is then related to the square of @xmath33 .",
    "finally , a reasonable agreement with the data is obtained ( see fig . [",
    "fig : crossw ] ) @xcite .",
    "dependence for dvcs and @xmath34 exclusive production : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "dependence for dvcs and @xmath34 exclusive production : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    one of the key measurement in exclusive processes is the slope defined by the exponential fit to the differential cross section : @xmath37 at small @xmath38 , where @xmath36 is the square of the momentum transfer at the proton vertex ( see fig . [ bslopes ] ) . a fourier transform from momentum to impact",
    "parameter space readily shows that the @xmath38-slope @xmath39 is related to the typical transverse distance between the colliding objects @xcite . at high scale ,",
    "the @xmath18 dipole is almost point - like , and the @xmath38 dependence of the cross section is given by the transverse extension of the gluons ( or sea quarks ) in the proton for a given @xmath3 range .",
    "more precisely , from the generalised gluon distribution @xmath33 defined in section 3 , we can compute a gluon density which also depends on a spatial degree of freedom , the transverse size ( or impact parameter ) , labeled @xmath40 , in the proton .",
    "both functions are related by a fourier transform @xmath41 thus , the transverse extension @xmath42 of gluons ( or sea quarks ) in the proton can be written as @xmath43_{t = 0 } = 2 b\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the exponential @xmath38-slope .",
    "measurements of @xmath39 have been performed for different channels , as dvcs or @xmath34 production ( see fig .",
    "[ bslopes]-left- ) , which corresponds to @xmath44  fm at large scale @xmath13 for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this value is smaller that the size of a single proton , and , in contrast to hadron - hadron scattering , it does not expand as energy @xmath10 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ bslopes]-right- ) .",
    "this result is consistent with perturbative qcd calculations in terms of a radiation cloud of gluons and quarks emitted around the incoming virtual photon .",
    "in section 3 , we have introduced the generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) in the presence of skewing , difference of momenta between the two exchanged gluons or quarks .",
    "these functions have interesting features : they interpolate between the standard pdfs and hadronic form factors .",
    "also , they complete the nucleon spin puzzle as they provide a measurement of the total angular momentum contribution of any parton to the nucleon spin @xcite . in the dvcs process",
    ", the skewing is large .",
    "it can be shown that the difference of momenta between the two exchanged partons reads : @xmath46 .",
    "that s why it is a golden reaction to access gpds , in particular when measuring its interference with the non - discernable ( electro - magnetic ) bethe - heitler ( bh ) process .    r0.5        following this strategy , different asymmetries can be extracted @xcite , which depend on the helicity / charge of the beam particles or on the polarisation of the target .",
    "these asymmetries are then directly related to the dvcs / bh interference , hence directly sensitive to gpds .",
    "the hermes collaboration , which is a fixed target experiment using the 27.6 gev electron beam of hera , has completed recently a measurement direclty sensitive to the @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks angular momenta @xcite .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ hermes ] where for the first time a constraint in the plane @xmath49 can be derived @xcite .",
    "in recent years , the production of the higgs boson in diffractive proton - proton collisions at the lhc has drawn more and more attention as a clean channel to study the properties of a light higgs boson or even discover it .",
    "this is an interesting example of a new challenge .",
    "the idea is to search for exclusive events at the lhc , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) @xcite . the full energy available in the center of mass is then used to produce the heavy object , which can be a dijet system , a @xmath10 boson or could be a higgs boson . with this topology ,",
    "the event produced is very clean : both protons escape and are detected in forward roman pot detectors , two large rapidity gaps are created on both sides and the central production of the heavy object gives some decay products well isolated in the detector ( see fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) ) .",
    "a second advantage of such events is that the resolution on the mass of the produced object can be determined with a high resolution from the measurement of the proton momentum loses ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , using the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the center of mass energy available in the collision . a potential signal , accessible in a mass distribution ,",
    "is then not washed out by the lower resolution when using central detectors , rather than forward roman pots to measure @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we have presented and discussed the most recent results on diffraction from the hera and tevatron experiments . with exclusive processes studies",
    ", we have shown that a scattering system consisting of a small size vector particle and the proton has a transverse extension ( at high scale ) smaller than a single proton and does not expand as energy increases .",
    "this result is consistent with perturbative qcd calculations in terms of a radiation cloud of gluons and quarks emitted around the incoming virtual photon .",
    "of special interest for future prospects is the exclusive production heavy objects ( including higgs boson ) at the lhc .",
