    "understanding the origin of high temperature plasma in the solar corona is one of the central problems in solar physics .",
    "the nanoflare concept represents one of the more popular theories for describing how energy stored in the sun s magnetic field is converted into thermal energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in nanoflare models turbulent photospheric motions drive the twisting and braiding of the magnetic field , which leads to the release of energy on small spatial scales as the accumulated topological complexity",
    "is dissipated by magnetic reconnection .",
    "nanoflares are often modeled as impulsive heating events where the plasma is heated to very high temperatures ( @xmath0mk ) and then cools down through a combination of conduction , enthalpy flux , and radiation without being reheated .",
    "furthermore , since these heating events are likely to occur on very small spatial scales an observed loop is assumed to be composed of many unresolved strands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this framework implies that nanoflare heated loops should have co - spatial hot and cool emission .    observations at relatively cool coronal temperatures , however , have have cast doubt on this heating scenario . @xcite and @xcite , for example ,",
    "have argued that cooling loops are often not observed in the core of an active region .",
    "this position has been supported by recent observations with the euv imaging spectrograph ( eis ) and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on the _ hinode _ mission @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no evidence for emission near 1mk that was spatially correlated with emission at higher temperatures ( 35mk ) in the core of an active region . in this region the high temperature emission measured with xrt was observed to be relatively constant over many hours .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found no evidence for strong variability in the intensities and doppler shifts measured in the moss , the footpoints of the high temperature loops .",
    "these results suggest that high temperature loops are generally heated on very short time scales , much shorter than a characteristic cooling time , and do not cool down to lower temperatures .",
    "previous studies on the properties of high temperature emission in the core of an active region have failed to adequately address a fundamental question : what is the distribution of temperatures in the core of an active region ?",
    "the eis spectral range contains emission lines from  which provide excellent coverage of the critical 35mk temperature range ( see @xcite ) .",
    "observations of these lines in combination with other emission lines observed with eis and observations with the thick xrt filters allow for the emission measure distribution to be computed over a very wide range of temperatures .",
    "the properties of the loop apexes along the line of sight are of particular importance .",
    "the dispersion in the temperature constrains the rate at which energy is input into high temperature loops and such information is critical for motivating physical models of this emission .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of new observations in the core of an active region taken after the launch of the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) .",
    "these observations feature spectroscopic observations from eis and soft x - ray images from xrt on _",
    "these data show that the emission measure distribution for the loop apex is peaked at temperatures near 4mk and falls off sharply at both higher and lower temperatures . at temperatures near 0.5mk",
    "the emission measure is more than two orders of magnitude below the value at 4mk .",
    "simple hydrodynamic modeling suggests that these properties are inconsistent with low frequency nanoflare heating models .",
    "such models predict low temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude larger than what is observed .",
    "the high cadence ( @xmath1s ) , high spatial resolution ( @xmath2 pixels ) , narrow band images provided by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on _ sdo _ provide additional information on the evolution of plasma at a wide range of temperatures .",
    "images from channels dominated by 1mk emission show only a few , isolated cooling loops in the moss regions , consistent with previous results . in this paper",
    "we also present some initial observations from the aia 94  channel , which is sensitive to the 93.94  line formed at about 7mk . in small flares and microflares the expected progression from high temperature to low temperature emission is observed . in more quiescent areas of the active region core , however , the emission appears to be relatively constant , potentially consistent with what is observed in xrt .",
    "in this paper we consider eis , xrt , and aia observations of noaa active region 11089 taken on 2010 july 23 .",
    "this section gives a brief overview of the various instruments , the available data , and the calculation of the differential emission measure distribution .",
    "the aia on _ sdo _ consists of 4 independent normal incidence , multi - layer telescopes , each with 2 channels .",
    "each channel images the full sun .",
    "the aia coronal channels and their dominant components are as follows : 94  ( and ) , 131  ( and , , and ) , 171  ( and ) , 193  ( ) , 211 ( ) , 335  ( ) . a detailed discussion of the predicted contributions to each aia channel is presented by @xcite .",
    "the relatively cool components of the 94 and 131  channels have been identified in high spectral resolution stellar observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a 304  channel and a uv channel .",
    "figure  [ fig : aia ] shows sample aia images from this active region region taken near 15 ut . for this work we use the level 1.5 cutout data that has been re - scaled and co - aligned to a common coordinate system .",
    "we note that to precisely co - align the data in the various channels we cross - correlated a subset of 20 full - disk images taken from the period of interest .",
    "these offsets were generally on the order of 12 pixels in each direction . de - rotation of the data was achieved by using established solar rotation rates .",
    "as is evident in the movies , there is very little jitter in the data .",
    "the xrt on _ hinode _",
    "@xcite is a grazing incidence , soft x - ray telescope .",
    "temperature discrimination is achieved through the use of focal plane filters . because xrt can observe the sun at short wavelengths",
    ", xrt can observe high temperature solar plasma very efficiently .",
    "for the observations considered here , xrt took images in the thin ti - poly filter at a cadence of about 120s , with al - thick context images taken approximately every 90 minutes .",
    "the observing was periodically interrupted by seasonal eclipses that occur annually during the may  august period .",
    "representative xrt ti - poly and al - thick images are shown in figure  [ fig : aia ] .",
    "the xrt images have been co - aligned with respect to the first image in the sequence .",
    "the xrt and aia data were co - aligned by cross - correlating the ti - poly and 335  images .",
    "this analysis incorporates the latest available calibration for xrt @xcite .    the eis instrument on _ hinode _",
    "@xcite is a high spatial and spectral resolution imaging spectrograph .",
    "eis observes two wavelength ranges , 171212  and 245291 , with a spectral resolution of about 22m and a spatial resolution of about 1  per pixel .",
    "solar images can be made by stepping the slit over a region of the sun .",
    "telemetry constraints generally limit the spatial and spectral coverage of an observation . for the observations considered here",
    "the 1  slit was stepped over the core of the active region using 60 2 steps and 512  of the slit height was read out . the field of view for the eis raster that was run between 14:32 and 15:34 ut on 2010 july 23 is indicated in figure  [ fig : aia ] .    the use of wide 2  steps in the eis raster degrades the spatial resolution somewhat , but allows for the raster to be completed in between _ hinode _ eclipses even while using relatively long ( 60s ) exposure time .",
    "the use of wide steps also reduces telemetry usage and allows for a very extensive line list to be telemetered to the ground . from these data",
    "we have determined intensities for 39 spectral lines .",
    "images for some of these emission lines are shown in figure  [ fig : eis ] .",
    "almost all of the line intensities can be determined by simple gaussian fits .",
    "the 192.858  line is complicated by blending with 192.813  and a complex of lines , including 192.906 .",
    "the intensities for these lines are determined using the method outlined by @xcite , where the intensity of the 192.813  line is inferred from 188.219  and the remaining part of the profile is fit with multiple gaussians .",
    "the resulting raster is consistent with 254.87 , indicating that the deconvolution is approximately correct .",
    "collectively , these data suggest a relatively simple morphology to the active region . the eis emission lines formed at high temperatures , ( 2.82mk ) , ( 3.55mk ) , ( 4.47mk ) , ( 5.01mk ) , and",
    "( 5.62mk ) , and the xrt ti - poly and al - thick images show relatively short , hot loops that connect across the neutral line running through the middle of the active region .",
    "the temperatures given here correspond to the peaks in the chianti 6.0 ionization fractions @xcite .",
    "below these hot loops are regions of intense `` moss , '' the footpoints of the hot loops that are evident in emission lines formed at temperatures near 1mk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as mentioned earlier , the relatively cool fan - like loops ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) appear to be largely absent from the core of the active region .",
    "the emission at these temperatures , however , is not zero .",
    "there is certainly diffuse million degree coronal emission lying above the active region .",
    "the aia movies also indicate that there is some million degree emission associated with the very cool , and highly dynamic filament - like material in the core of the active region that connects across the neutral line at very low heights .    as mentioned previously",
    ", the primary strength of the xrt is the ability to observe high temperature emission over a wide field of view at relatively high cadence .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : xrt ] , where light curves from several positions in the core of the active region are shown .",
    "each light curve is from a single pixel , there is no spatial averaging .",
    "consistent with earlier analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these light curves show relatively constant emission .",
    "typical intensities generally lie within a range of @xmath3 over many hours .",
    "transient brightenings are observed , but they are relatively short lived , with lifetimes of 900s or less .    the aia movies , which are included in the electronic version of this manuscript , show that the moss is consistent with the relatively constant emission observed in xrt .",
    "the aia 131 and 171  movies show clear evidence for many fine coronal loops in the active region .",
    "few of these loops , however , connect to elements of the moss .",
    "there is evidence for intensity fluctuations in the moss itself , but it is likely that this is related to spicular activity that obscures the moss @xcite .    the primary objective of this study is to determine the distribution of temperatures in the hot loops in the core of the active region .",
    "we are particularly interested in the conditions at the loop apexes along the line of sight that avoids contamination from the moss emission .",
    "such measurements are important for determining the physical conditions in the high temperature loops . to accomplish this we have determined spatially averaged eis line profiles in the small `` inter - moss '' region indicated in figures  [ fig : aia ] and [ fig : eis ] .",
    "the size of this region is @xmath4 or 75 spatial pixels when we account for the 2  steps .",
    "this region has relatively little contamination from the moss or from overlying loops .",
    "the spatial averaging diminishes the uncertainties for the intensities of some of the weaker lines and allows for a more complete analysis .",
    "the intensities for these line profiles are computed using the same assumptions as the spatially resolved intensities shown in the rasters .",
    "the intensities from this region are given in table  [ table : ints1 ] .",
    "the selection of lines is motivated by previous emission measure calculations in the quiet sun @xcite and in flares @xcite .",
    "this previous work has identified emission lines that are mutually consistent .",
    "note that 254.87  has been left out because of uncertainties in the atomic data @xcite .",

    "the peak emission measure is approximately @xmath14@xmath15 while the emission measure at @xmath16 , the temperature of formation for , is about a factor of 400 less .",

    "the intensities for these lines in the dimmest areas of the active region are typically 10% of the core intensity and close to the core the intensities are comparable .",
    "this suggests a very large range of possibilities . in all cases the background subtracted intensities would be lower than the values that we have used",

    "an estimate of the event occurrence rate was given by @xcite using @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average event energy , @xmath29 is the radiative loss rate of the corona , and @xmath30 is the spatial scale for coronal loops . for @xmath31erg , @xmath32@xmath33 , and @xmath34erg  @xmath35",

    "since the loop never cools , the modeled intensities at low temperatures are close to zero .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the relatively weak cool emission is unrelated to the high temperature active region loops and comes from either very low - lying loops or very long loops that extend over the active region .",
    "for @xmath47 the loop will evolve over a large range of temperatures and will be far from equilibrium . to illustrate an example of the low - frequency heating that is usually assumed in nano - flare modeling we consider the parameters @xmath48s , @xmath49s , and @xmath50erg  cm@xmath26  s@xmath26 .",

    ", the modeled intensity is almost a factor of 10 times too large .",
    "the difficulty for the low - frequency heating scenario is the slow draining of the density from the loop .",
    "previous work has suggested an @xmath54 relationship ( @xcite ; see also the more recent work by @xcite which refines this scaling law ) .",

    "must be large , which leads to high temperatures and large 192.858  and xrt al - thick intensities .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the power law index that we measure in the emission measure distribution between the peak near @xmath56 and lower temperatures is steeper than most previous measurements and steeper than is expected from simple heating models , which can have a emission measure that scales like @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is likely a result of averaging over a small region near the loop apexes in the observations . to demonstrate this",
    "we have calculated the emission measure distributions , essentially histograms of @xmath58 , from both the high- and low - frequency heating simulations .",
    "these distributions , which are shown in figure  [ fig : dem2 ] , clearly illustrate the effect of averaging .",

    "the contrast between the moss and inter - moss regions at low temperatures , however , is small . for 275.368 , for example",
    ", the intensities only increase by a factor of about 2 in the moss .",
    "it is clear that the large discrepancy between the intensities computed from the low - frequency heating scenario would not be changed significantly by modifying the region used for the averaging .    since the rasters for the lowest temperature lines are relatively noisy , it is tempting to think that these lines are simply too faint to measure reliably .",
    "as we illustrate in figure  [ fig : resp ] , however , the emissivity for 275.368 , which is one of the primary eis lines at low temperatures is actually higher than the emissivity for the high temperature 262.984  line , which is easily observed in the core of the active region .",

    "the emissivity for 192.858  is higher than that for 193.874 , suggesting that loops that have been heated up to very high temperatures ( @xmath0mk ) and are cooling would show comparable intensities in these lines . instead",
    ", the data show that the emission is weaker than the emission from .",
    "again , the observations are difficult to reconcile with traditional hydrodynamic models of impulsively heated loops .     and 6.9 .",
    "the power law indexes ( @xmath63 ) are indicated for several of the emission measure distributions . ]",
    "as we have already seen in figure  [ fig : aia ] , aia s combination of high cadence , high spatial resolution , and broad temperature coverage provide new ways to explore the temperature structure of an active region . of particular interest to studies of high temperature active region loops",

    "is the 131  channel , which contains , , and lines .",
    "another channel not previously flown is the 335  channel , which images 335.4 . in figure",
    "[ fig : resp ] we show the isothermal temperature response curves for the aia 171 , 335 , 94 , and 131  channels along with the emissivities for the eis high temperature lines ( and  ) , and the two xrt channels considered in this paper .",
    "the aia 94  channel is of particular interest because it combines high spatial and temporal resolution with a relatively narrow temperature response .",
    "the eis emission lines are formed at somewhat lower temperatures and , at least for these observations , have no temporal resolution .",
    "xrt observes these temperatures at high cadence , but has a very broad temperature response .",
    "since the cross - calibration of the aia instrument is just beginning at this point , we re interested only in some very basic questions , such as what is the morphology of the emission in this channel and how does it evolve with time ?    to provide some context for interpreting the aia 94  and 131  channels",
    "we have used the simulations results for the high and low frequency heating cases shown in figures  [ fig : hf ] and [ fig : lf ] to compute the expected count rates in these channels . as one would expect , we find that the amount of high temperature emission observed in these channels is sensitive to the heating time scale . for the low - frequency heating case , which reaches temperatures close to 10mk , observable emission ( @xmath64100  dn  s@xmath26 ) is predicted for both channels .",
    "the high - frequency case shows some signal in the 94  channel but relatively little in 131 .",
    "these comparisons suggest that these channels will provide important information on the heating time scale .",
    "quantitative comparisons , however , will require the aia calibration to be more fully understood",
    ". also , at these high temperatures the potential for departures from ionization equilibrium are much greater .",
    "it is clear from the movie of the 94  channel , which is available in the electronic version of the manuscript , that there is significant emission from in the core of the active region .",
    "this channel , however , also contains contributions from lines formed at lower temperatures .",
    "comparisons with the 171  channel allow us to identify the high temperature , loops .",
    "such comparisons suggest that the bulk of the emission lies at the inner edge of the moss on loops that connect directly across the neutral line .    to address the question of temporal evolution we have taken the co - aligned and de - rotated data cubes used to make the movies and computed light curves for various points in the active region .",
    "light curves for three points are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "one of the points illustrates the evolution of a small flare . here",
    "the light curves show the progression from the high temperature flare emission of  , to the hot and , to the relatively cool .",
    "this qualitative agreement between the observations and our expectations for a flare light curve suggests that the emission lines contributing to each channel are properly identified .",
    "other small `` microflaring '' events show a similar progression , except that the cooling to the lowest temperatures is difficult to identify ( middle panel ) . finally , the majority of the pixels in the core of the active region do not show coherent behavior . in these pixels",
    "the intensities measured in the 131 and 171  channels are well correlated , suggesting an absence of plasma at flare temperatures . for these points",
    "the 94 and 335  channels do not show any obvious correlation .",
    "there is no general tendency for brightenings in the 94  channel to be followed by brightenings in 335 .",
    "this is potentially consistent with the high - frequency heating scenario , but will require more quantitative analysis to demonstrate conclusively .",
    "we have presented the detailed analysis of high temperature active region core loops using observations from _ hinode _ and _ sdo_. the primary result is the calculation of the emission measure , which shows a sharp peak at about 4mk and a steep decline at both higher and lower temperatures .",
    "these observations provide a difficult challenge to the low - frequency heating scenarios that have traditionally been associated with nanoflare heating models of the corona .",
    "as we ve shown with some very simple hydrodynamic simulations , such models predict significant emission at lower temperatures , but the observed emission measure below 1mk is generally small in the core of an active region near the loop apexes .",
    "a high - frequency heating scenario , in contrast , agrees with the observed intensities of the high temperature emission lines , is consistent with the relatively steady emission observed in xrt , and with the absence of cooling loops in the moss in the cool aia channels ( e.g. , 171 ) .",
    "our analysis provides compelling evidence that there is a significant population of loops in the core of a solar active region that are heated on very short time scales , much shorter than a typical cooling time for this combination of density ( @xmath65 ) , temperature ( @xmath66 ) , and loop length ( @xmath67 mm ) .",
    "we suggest that this combination of parameters is a useful set for theorists to consider in developing physical models of high temperature coronal loops .",
    "the challenge is to identify a physical mechanism that not only reproduces these conditions , but is also frequent enough to keep the loop at high temperatures for long periods of time .",
    "one limitation of the high - frequency heating scenario , however , is that it does not reproduce the emission that is observed at low temperatures . in the emission measure distributions shown in figure  [ fig : dem2 ] , for example , it is clear that the result from the high - frequency simulation is close to observed distribution at high temperatures ( above @xmath68 ) , but significantly under - predicts the distribution at low temperatures .",
    "one possibility is that there is a range of heating time scales at work in the solar atmosphere . @xcite and @xcite , for example ,",
    "have suggested a relationship between magnetic topology and the variability of the heating .",
    "transient brightenings appear to be associated with magnetic complexity , while magnetically simple regions show relatively constant emission .",
    "motivated by the emission measure distributions shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] we have constructed composite intensities with 90% high - frequency heating and 10% low - frequency heating . as is shown in table",
    "[ table : ints2 ] , this simple mixture provides a better match to the observations at both high and low temperatures .",
    "this does nt provide a consistent description for all of the lines , but does suggest how a complete description of the observed emission might be achieved .",
    "we stress that the hydrodynamic simulations presented here represent a very small set of possible heating scenarios .",
    "some 0d impulsive heating models have produced relatively steep slopes in the emission measure distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have had trouble reproducing these results with hydrodynamic simulations and we are currently investigating this systematically .",
    "other considerations , such as variations in loop length along the line of sight , differences in initial conditions , or accounting for non - equilibrium ionization , may bring low - frequency , nanoflare heating models into better agreement with the observations .",
    "much more extensive analysis is required .",
    "one significant hurdle that all models must clear is reproducing the observed intensities both in the corona and at the footpoints .",
