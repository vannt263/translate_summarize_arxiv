    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period , semi - detached binary systems consisting of an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) star ( the primary ) and a low - mass main - sequence star ( the secondary ) as the roche lobe - filling mass donor @xcite . in non magnetic cv systems , the mass is accreted by means of an accretion disk reaching all the way down to the surface of the wd .",
    "on - going accretion at a low rate ( quiescence ) is interrupted every few weeks to months by intense accretion ( outburst ) of days to weeks - a dwarf nova ( dn ) accretion event .",
    "cv systems are divided in sub - classes according to the durations , occurrence and amplitude of their outburst : e.g. dwarf nova systems ( dns ) spend most of their time in the quiescent state , while nova - like systems ( nls ) are found mostly in the high outburst state . both dn and non - magnetic nl systems exhibit emission from the accretion disk during the high state .",
    "far ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations have shown that some wds in cvs can be directly viewed in the uv when the accretion disk is not dominant ( as ealy as @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , much effort has gone to observe the systems with low mass transfer rates . in those systems",
    "the wds are hotter than single field wds and their temperature increases with orbital period , as higher accretion rates are found in longer period systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , while the binary period of the cv systems ranges between a fraction of an hour ( e.g. am cvn systems ) up to @xmath13 day ( e.g. gk per ) , there is a gap between about 2 and 3h where almost no system is found ( hereafter the `` period gap '' ) .",
    "however , at a given orbital period the accretion rate can vary by a large amount and unfortunately there are not many data points for long period systems above the period gap ( @xmath143hrs ) . in the accretion disk limit cycle @xcite",
    ", material accumulates in the accretion disk during quiescence and accretes onto the wd during outburst . in order for an outburst to occur",
    ", the accretion rate must be below a critical value for a given orbital period .",
    "dne at periods above the gap should have accretion rates below the limit , the rates for z cam are very close to the critical value and the novalikes have rates above the limit .",
    "thus , above the period gap one finds 3 classes of systems : u gem ( dn ) type that undergo outbursts ; z cam ( dn ) type which have standstills where they remain at about one magnitude below their outburst level for long times ; and nova - like systems that are in a permanent high state .    among these high accretion nl systems ,",
    "only the underlying wds of dw uma @xcite , tt ari @xcite and mv lyr @xcite have been studied for temperature , gravity , rotation and chemical abundances information .",
    "all the other nls that have been observed have been caught in a high state .",
    "the spectra of nls ( in permanent high state ) consist of h emission lines which may of may not be superimposed on broad shallow absorption features ; and the brightness fluctuates about some mean value , deviating up and down irregularly by no more than about 1 magnitude .",
    "the spectra in the near uv and optical is consistent with that of an accretion disk in outburst .",
    "while nls are characterized by an approximately steady , high rate of mass transfer ( and consequently a high luminous accretion disk - a permanent high state ) , there is a class of nls ( namely , the vy sculptoris systems ) in which the prolonged state of high accretion is interrupted unpredictably by low brightness states of little or no accretion when the disk greatly shrinks or vanishes and the underlying accretion heated hot wd is exposed , as it is the case for mv lyr @xcite .",
    "the vy scl systems are apparently all disk systems with negligible ( magnetic ) accretion at the poles .",
    "v794 aql is a nova - like system belonging to the vy sculptoris class , or at least it appears to have observational properties consistent with this class .",
    "the vy scl stars fall above the period gap , all in the range 3 - 4hr , except for v751 cyg with @xmath15h .",
    "the vy scl have all extreme ( 3-magnitude ) brightness variations in the high state and unexpectedly fall to an extreme low state ( more than 5 magnitudes ) .",
    "v794 aql has been seen to vary erratically between photographic magnitude 14 and 17 on time scales of days to years @xcite , and @xcite observed v794 aql in an unprecedented low state with magnitude 20 !",
    "photometrically speaking , v794 aql seems to be one of the most active cataclysmic variables with brightness variations of up to 0.5 mag occurring on a timescale of minutes ( and smaller flares on timescales of tens of seconds , @xcite ) .",
    "the brightness variations in vy scl systems appear to be random in amplitude , shape and recurrence interval .",
    "however , v794 aql is an exception : photometric monitoring of v794 aql has revealed an unusual type of light curve @xcite , in which the uniform decline from high to low state is interupted by an abrupt return to the high state , giving the light curve a distinctive sawtooth appearance .",
    "this is a type of photometric variation in cvs which has never been reported .",
    "v794 aql was spectroscopically observed in high and low state in the optical @xcite , in the uv with _ iue _ @xcite and in the x - ray with einstein @xcite , and in respects other than the character of its long - term light curve , v794 aql was found to have a photometric and spectroscopic behavior very similar to other members of the nl vy sculptoris class , such as mv lyrae and tt arietis .    in the x - ray ,",
    "v794 aql was observed near a high state in terms of its optical range .",
    "the system had a flux of @xmath16 ergs@xmath17@xmath1s@xmath6 ( in the 0.1 - 4.5 kev band ) , corresponding to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath18ergs@xmath17s@xmath6 , for a distance d=100pc .",
    "the source was detected in both the soft ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) and hard ( 0.5 - 4.5 kev ) energy bands , and the hardness ratio was found to be @xmath19 ( though the apparent hardness can be affected by the absorption of soft x - rays either at the source itself or in the ism ; and ism absorption might not be negligible for v794 aql - see section 2.2 ) .",
    "simultaneous ground - based optical observations showed blue colors , strong h emission with a flat balmer decrement , plus strong he and he @xmath204686 emission .",
    "these _ iue _ , x - ray , as well as optical spectra show relatively strong emission lines of intermediate excitation , similar to those seen in other vy sculptoris stars in both the low state and the high state . in the low state reported by @xcite",
    "the accretion disk emission lines were replaced by very narrow balmer emission , in a behavior similar to ( but more extreme than ) that of mv lyr ( e.g. @xcite ) and a few other nl systems in which the accretion apparently switches off for brief periods of time .",
    "though v794 aql has many of the properties of a typical disk vy scl star , there has been no direct evidence yet that a disk exists in this system .",
    "v794 aql can not be classified as a z cam system , as the sawtooths are consistently much fainter than the occasional intervals of steady brightness characteristic of z cam systems .",
    "if v794 aql is a z cam system , then it is certainly a very unusual one .",
    "@xcite studied v794 aql from _ iue _ spectra , however the low resolution and geocoronal contamination of the _ iue _ spectra prevented accurate determination of the temperature and the low response shortward of ly@xmath21 prevented any observation of a rising continuum from the hot wd .",
    "this study estimated a white dwarf temperature near 50,000k , while the accretion rate has been estimated to be around @xmath22yr@xmath6 @xcite - based on the long term optical variations of the system .",
    "this nl system has the highest mass accretion rate , above the limit for outbursts . because of its inclination , both the hot wd and the inner disk might be observable .    more recently an _",
    "hst_/stis snapshot of v794 aql was obtained , and the system was also observed in the fuv with _ fuse _ under a cycle 4 program . in this paper , we report a spectral analysis of the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra of v794 aql using accretion disk models , photosphere models , and models combining white dwarfs and accretion disks .",
    "our objectives are to identify the source(s ) of the fuv radiation , derive the properties of the wd ( if possible ) , the accretion disk , and characterize the hot component in the system .",
    "we report here all the ultraviolet spectra of v794 aql .",
    "this includes 5 _ iue _ archival spectra , one _ hst_/stis spectrum and one _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "while we model mainly the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra , we also use the _ iue _ spectra for flux comparison to estimate the relative state in which the system was found during each observation .",
    "for all the spectra we identify the emission and absorption features with a particular emphasis on the estimate of the molecular and atomic hydrogen column densities using the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis ( which covers the ly @xmath21 region ) .",
    "we use the _ iue _ spectra to carry out an assessment of the reddening of the system .",
    "the reason for questioning the zero color excess value of @xcite is in part the _ a posteriori _ fact that the slope of the continuum ( both in the _ fuse _ and stis spectra ) can not be easily matched with the model fits when assuming a small e(b - v ) value .",
    "we obtain a large residual in the longer wavelength indicating a net excess of flux in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "this discrepancy basically disappears when we deredden the spectra assuming @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the hydrogen column density we obtain from the _ fuse _ and stis spectra leads to a reddening of e(b - v)=0.08 using the relation of @xcite ,      the _ iue _ archive contains three good observations of v794 aql with the short - wavelength prime ( swp ) camera through the large aperture at low dispersion ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) .",
    "one additional _ iue _",
    "swp spectrum ( swp 14708 ) has an extremely low flux level and a very low signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "this spectrum has been disregarded here as it has basically no continuum and can not be used .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "swp spectra have a wavelength binning of 1.68  , covering the wavelength range 1150 to 1980 .",
    "there is also a data set obtained with the long - wavelength camera lwr 11782 , which we use to assess the reddening of the system .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "lwr spectrum has a wavelength binning of 1.67  , and covers the wavelength range 1850 - 3350 .",
    "all the _ iue _ newsips spectra were flux - calibration corrected using the massa - fitzpatrick corrections @xcite . these spectra were analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the swp 28501 spectrum was obtained when the system had a visual magnitude of 17 - 18 , a relatively low state , though not the lowest state of v794 aql ( magnitude 20 reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum swp 15266 has a flux only slightly larger than swp 28501 , but in addition it exhibits some broad emission lines .",
    "the most prominent ones are @xmath24 ( 1238/1243 ) , @xmath25 ( 1394/1403 ) , @xmath26 ( 1548/1550 ) , and @xmath27 ( 1640  balmer @xmath21 ) . with its broad emission lines characteristic of nova - like systems ,",
    "the spectrum of v794 aql show evidence of hot gas .",
    "the swp 50754 shows the system in a relatively higher state with emission and absorption features , however , the s / n of this spectra is very low .",
    "the presently accepted value for the reddening of v794 aql is @xmath28 ( e.g. @xcite , based on the work of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the heavy interstellar hydrogen absorption in its _ fuse _ spectrum ( see next subsection ) implies that the source is either located pretty far away , or masked by an ism cloud , or some cold circumstellar matter , and consequently it is probably also affected by dust , therefore making the assumption @xmath28 very unlikely . in his pioneer work , @xcite carried out an analysis of the broad ( several hundreds   ) absorption feature around 2175    of the _ iue _ spectra of 51 cv systems to determine their reddening value e(b - v ) .",
    "the reddening of the 51 systems was assessed by dereddening each spectrum assuming increasing values of e(b - v ) ( e.g. 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 .. ) until the broad absorption dip ( between @xmath292000  and @xmath292400 ) disappeared completely to the `` eye '' ( i.e. the acceptable range of values of e(b - v ) were found by visual inspection ) .",
    "following @xcite we first combine the _ iue _ spectra swp 28501 and lwr 11782 binned at 20  ( we have chosen the swp 28501 spectrum as it matches the flux level and shape of lwr 11782 ) .",
    "the spectra are very noisy , including a hot pixel at 2200 .",
    "this combined spectrum is then dereddened assuming values e(b - v)=0.10 , 0.20 and 0.30 . in figure 2",
    "we plot the ab - magnitude @xcite for each dereddened spectrum for visual inspection .",
    "the broad absorption feature is more apparent in the shortest wavelengths between 2000  and 2200  in the e(b - v)=0 spectrum , an indication that the reddening is not zero .",
    "obviously for e(b - v)=0.30 there is excess emission around @xmath30 . for e(b - v)=0.10 and 0.20",
    "the absorption feature is not that apparent as the flux seems to level off , an indication that the reddening is probably around @xmath31 but could be as large as 0.20 . since we have only one _ iue _ lwr spectrum of v794 aql , and it is extremely noisy , it is difficult to say more about the reddening .",
    "in addition , we see how difficult it can be to assess how much of the broad absorption feature is present when it is left only to a visual inspection to decide , as one can not differentiate between noise and signal .",
    "this is probably the reason why @xcite assumed an error of 0.1 for v794 aql .",
    "the difference between our reddening assessment and verbunt s might reside in the fact that verbunt co - added all the swp spectra together , even though only the swp 28501 spectrum matches the lwr 11782 spectrum . also , since the estimate is carried out by visual inspection , the subjectivity of the observer is also a decisive factor .",
    "_ fuse _ is a low - earth orbit satellite , launched in june 1999 .",
    "its optical system consists of four optical telescopes ( mirrors ) , each separately connected to a different rowland spectrograph .",
    "the four diffraction gratings of the four rowland spectrographs produce four independent spectra on two microchannel plates .",
    "two mirrors and two gratings are coated with sic to provide wavelength coverage below 1020  , while the other two mirrors and gratings are coated with al and lif overcoat .",
    "the al+lif coating provides about twice the reflectivity of sic at wavelengths @xmath141050  , and very little reflectivity below 1020 (hereafter the sic1 , sic2 , lif1 and lif2 channels ) .",
    "a time tag _ fuse _ spectrum ( d1440101 ) of v794 aql was obtained starting on 2003 , may 13 , ( at 19:50:22 ) with a total observing duration covering 6 individual spacecraft orbits through the lwrs .",
    "the system was in a relatively high state at the time of the observation .",
    "the data were processed with calfuse version 3.0 totaling 13,066s of good exposure time .",
    "the main change from previous versions of calfuse is that now the data are maintained as a photon list ( the intermediate data file - idf ) throughout the pipeline .",
    "bad photons are flagged but not discarded , so the user can examine , filter , and combine data without re - running the pipeline .",
    "a number of design changes enable the new pipeline to run faster and use less disk space than before .",
    "processing time with calfuse has decreased by a factor of up to 10 . in this version , event bursts are automatically taken care of .",
    "event bursts are short periods during an exposure when high count rates are registered on one of more detectors .",
    "the bursts exhibit a complex pattern on the detector , their cause , however , is yet unknown ( it has been confirmed that they are not detector effects ) .    during the observations , fine error sensor a , which images the lif 1",
    "aperture was used to guide the telescope .",
    "the spectral regions covered by the spectral channels overlap , and these overlap regions are then used to renormalize the spectra in the sic1 , lif2 , and sic2 channels to the flux in the lif1 channel .",
    "we then produced a final spectrum that covers almost the full _ fuse _ wavelength range @xmath32  .",
    "the low sensitivity portions of each channel were discarded .",
    "here we took particular care to discard the portion of the spectrum where the so - called _ worm _ crawls , which deteriorates lif1 longward of @xmath33    ( calfuse can not correct target fluxes for this effect ) . because of this the @xmath34   region was lost ( see the _ fuse _ instrument and data handbook or section 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "we combined the individual exposures and channels to create a time - averaged spectrum with a linear , @xmath35   dispersion , weighting the flux in each output datum by the exposure time and sensitivity of the input exposure and channel of origin .",
    "v794 aql , with a flux of a few @xmath36ergs@xmath17s@xmath6@xmath1@xmath6 , is actually a relatively weak source .",
    "the procedure we used to process the _ fuse _ data of v794 aql is the same as the one we used in our previous _",
    "fuse _ analysis of cvs , such as e.g. ru peg & ss aur @xcite , vw hyi @xcite , or ww cet @xcite . + * interstellar absorption toward v794 aql *    a single look at the _ fuse _ spectrum of v794 aql ( figure 3 ) immediately reveals that the continuum is moderately affected by hydrogen absorption : the continuum is basically sliced ( at almost equal intervals ) by interstellar hydrogen lines starting at wavelengths around 1110  and continuing towards shorter wavelengths all the way down to the hydrogen cut - off around 915  . in table 3",
    "we identified all the absorption and emission lines of metals in the _ fuse _ spectrum of v794 aql . in table 4",
    "we identified the most prominent molecular hydrogen absorption lines by their band ( werner or lyman ) , upper vibrational level ( 1 - 16 ) , and rotational transition ( r , p , or q ) with lower rotational state ( j=1,2,3 ) .",
    "next , we model the ism hydrogen absorption lines to assess the atomic and molecular column densities .",
    "we use a custom spectral fitting package to estimate the temperature and density of the interstellar absorption lines of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the ism model assumes that the temperature , bulk velocity , and turbulent velocity of the medium are the same for all atomic and molecular species , whereas the densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen , and the ratios of deuterium to hydrogen and metals ( including helium ) to hydrogen can be adjusted independently .",
    "the model uses atomic data of @xcite and molecular data of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth calculations of molecular hydrogen have been checked against those of @xcite .    for v794 aql , the ratios of metals to hydrogen and deuterium to hydrogen",
    "are fixed at 0 and @xmath37 , respectively , because of the low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the wings of the atomic lines are used to estimate the density of atomic hydrogen and the depth of the unsaturated molecular lines for molecular hydrogen .",
    "the temperature and turbulent velocity of the medium are primarily determined from the lines of molecular hydrogen when the ism temperatures @xmath38k .    in order to model the atomic hydrogen column density correctly , we take care to include the portion of the _ hst_/stis spectrum exhibiting the ly @xmath21 feature into the modeling . in figure 4",
    "we show our fit to the ( atomic and molecular ) hydrogen absorption lines to the _ fuse _ spectrum of v794 aql , as applied to our wd model fit ( namely , we multiplied the wd synthetic spectral model by the transmission values obtained from the ism model ) .",
    "this ism model has zero metalicity , a temperature of 150k , a turbulent velocity of 40km@xmath17s@xmath6 , a molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath39@xmath1 and an atomic hydrogen column density of @xmath40@xmath1 .",
    "the ly @xmath41 feature around 1025  is obviously far too sharp to be due to the disk , even with an inclination of only @xmath42 this feature would be much broader .",
    "this absorption feature can not be accounted by the star itself neither and it is modeled here as part of the ism model .    it is interesting to note that the hydrogen column density of v794 aql that we obtain here is very similar to the hydrogen column density of v1432 aql @xcite which is located in the same region of the sky ( at about 230 pc ) .",
    "v1432 aql is much closer to v794 aql than any of the nearest neighboring sources found by the ism hydrogen column density tool from the _ euve _ web site .",
    "also in the same vicinity and at about the same distance ( @xmath43pc ) , uu aql exhibits strong hydrogen absorption features in it _ fuse _ spectrum @xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that this region of sky in the constellation of aquila might have an ism cloud in the foreground ( say at @xmath44pc or less ) .",
    "next , we use the hydrogen column density we obtained to estimate the reddening of the system using the analytical expression given by @xcite : @xmath45 we are aware that this expression is not accurate , in that sens that it represents a mean extinction law with a large deviation , as the ratio of dust to hydrogen is not constant .",
    "for example , objects towards which the atomic column density is ( say ) @xmath46atoms @xmath1 , have a e(b - v ) value ranging from 0.03 to 0.2 , almost a factor of 10 . for hydrogen column densities higher than @xmath47atoms",
    "e(b - v ) varies only by a factor of 3 but the typical scatter is really of only about 30% .",
    "using our computed ism value for the hydrogen column density @xmath2@xmath1 and @xmath48@xmath1 in equation ( 1 ) , we obtain @xmath49 .",
    "the actual reddening toward v794 aql could be smaller or larger than 0.08 as explained in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , from the visual inspection of m(ab ) of the _ iue _ spectra of v794 aql we decide to model the spectra of v794 aql for 2 values of the reddening , namely e(b - v)=0.1 and e(b - v)=0.2 .",
    "an _ hst_/stis snapshot spectrum of v794 aql was obtained on august 28 2003 , totaling 830 sec of exposure time .",
    "the spectrum was taken with the 0.2x0.2 aperture in accum ( accumulation ) mode using the g140l grating , covering the wavelength range from 1150 to 1710 , with a wavelength binning of @xmath50 .",
    "the use of g140l provides a higher resolution spectrum than _ iue _ , but not as high as when using e140 m .",
    "the spectrum was taken in a relatively high state , similar to the state during which the _ fuse _ spectrum was obtained .",
    "the spectrum exhibits some broad emission lines , mainly @xmath51 ( 1175 ) , @xmath52 ( 1240 ) , @xmath25 ( 1400 ) , @xmath26 ( 1550 ) and @xmath27 ( 1640 ) .",
    "other possible lines are also annotated in figure 1 .",
    "also very pronounced is the ly @xmath21 absorption feature ( around 1215 ) . on the sides of the ly@xmath21 absorption feature",
    "there is some emission from @xmath53 on the left and @xmath54 on the right .",
    "the ly@xmath21 absorption feature is too sharp to be that of the wd and/or the accretion disk of v794 aql , however , it agrees very well with the hydrogen column density we found , except that it should be saturated , as the transmission values of the ism model are null there due the high column density of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the only reason the ly@xmath21 is not saturated in the observed stis spectrum of v794 aql is because the spectral resolution ( @xmath55 ) of the g140l grating combined with the short exposures required by snapshots often does not resolve the sharp geocoronal @xmath56 emission , seen in many stis g140l exposures of some systems .",
    "for example the ( mast ) archived stis snapshot of vy scl ( with e(b - v)=0.06 @xcite ) has a sharp ly@xmath21 absorption feature that is not saturated , and the stis snapshots of ss aur and v442 cen ( with e(b - v)=0.08 and 0.15 , respectively ; @xcite ) show clearly a sharp emission peak in the bottom of their ly@xmath21 profile .",
    "all these systems with a reddening value as large as that of v794 aql have most probably an atomic hydrogen column density larger than @xmath57@xmath1 and should therefore all have a saturated ly@xmath21 absorption feature ( for any line of sight with @xmath58@xmath1 the ly@xmath21 absorption feature should be saturated ) .",
    "not enough light - curve data points were available from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) to determine whether v794 aql was observed in a high or low state .",
    "however , a comparison of the _ fuse _ spectrum with the _ iue _ archival spectra and the _ hst_/stis snapshot ( see figure 1 ) helps us to assess the state in which the system was at the time each observations was made . from that figure",
    "it is clear that v794 aql was observed in about four different states .",
    "the lowest _ iue _ spectrum has a flux about 5 times lower than the _ fuse _ and stis spectra .",
    "this _ iue _ spectrum , however , was itself not obtained during the lowest state(@xmath59 ) .",
    "it seems therefore quite clear that the _ fuse _ and stis spectra need mainly to be modeled with a disk model and the contribution of the wd might be small .",
    "however , because of its inclination ( @xmath60 ) the contribution of the heated wd during outburst might be non - negligible .",
    "though there is a large error bar on the mass of the wd ( 0.88 @xmath61 0.4 @xmath62 ) , we deliberately decided to use only one mass in our modeling ( @xmath63 ) to limit the number of unknown parameters in the system : the distance , the inclination @xmath64 , the reddening .",
    "we deredden the spectra assuming a reddening of e(b - v)=0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "we prepared the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ spectra for fitting by masking regions containing emission lines and artifacts .",
    "these regions are emphasized with a blue color in figure 3 .",
    "these regions of the spectrum were not included in the fitting .",
    "a comparison of the _ hst_/stis spectrum with the _ fuse _ spectrum in the wavelength overlap region reveals that the flux levels match thus enabling us to carry out model fits over a substantially broader wavelength range .",
    "the high - gravity white dwarf atmosphere model spectra are generated assuming solar abundances ( unless otherwise specified ) using tlusty200 @xcite , synspec48 and rotin4 @xcite .",
    "tlusty generates numerical models of stellar atmospheres for a given surface gravity and effective temperature .",
    "synspec is then used to generate a synthetic spectrum for each particular stellar atmosphere model .",
    "the routine rotin is used last to perform a rotational and/or instrumental convolution of the synthetic spectrum obtained from synspec . for the input temperature in tlusty , we chose t ranging from 15,000k to 55,000k by increments of 5,000k at first , and when a best fit is found a refined fitting is carried out by changing the temperature in increments of 1,000k .",
    "we chose a value of @xmath65 to match the mass of the wd in v794 aql , namely @xmath66 .",
    "we also varied the stellar rotational velocity @xmath67 from @xmath68km@xmath17s@xmath6 to @xmath69km@xmath17s@xmath6 in steps of @xmath68km@xmath17s@xmath6 .",
    "we have the possibility to change the abundance of elements , however , we first ran a model with solar composition and only changed the si and c abundances in two cases , to assess how it affects the results .    for the synthetic accretion disk models , we used the latest accretion disk models from the optically thick disk model grid of @xcite .",
    "the range of disk model parameters in the grid of @xcite varies as follows : wd mass ( in solar masses ) values of 0.35 , 0.55 , 0.80 , 1.03 , and 1.21 ; orbital inclination ( in degrees ) of 18 , 41 , 60 , 75 , and 81 . the accretion rate ranges from @xmath70yr@xmath6 to @xmath71yr@xmath6 ,",
    "varying in increments of 0.5 in log m. for the present work we select from this grid the models with parameters consistent with table 1 , namely : wd masses 0.80 and 1.03@xmath62 , an inclination angle of 18 , 41 and 60@xmath72 and the entire range of mass accretion rates from the grid of @xcite .    for combined accretion disk and stellar wd atmosphere models , the disk flux is divided by 100 to normalize it at 1000pc to match the wd flux , therefore giving explicitly the relative flux contributions of each component .",
    "then both fluxes are added for comparison with the observed flux .",
    "the best two - component models are not especially a combination of the best wd models with the best disk models . the main aim here is to find a fit that is better ( lower @xmath73 ) than both the wd model fit and the accretion disk model fit .    before finding the best fit , all the synthetic spectral models ( wd , accretion disk , and wd+accretion disk ) are multiplied by the transmission values of the ism model presented in section 2.2 .      in order to find the best model , we use fit - a @xmath12 minimization routine ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for each model , we computed @xmath74 and scale factor values",
    ". @xmath73 is known as the `` reduced '' chi - squared , namely @xmath12 per number of degrees of freedom . in the present case",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is the number of wavelength bins of the observed spectrum taken into account in the fitting .",
    "therefore , when we exclude ( i.e. mask ) regions of the spectrum ( such as broad emission lines and features such as air glow ) in preparation for the fitting , we reduce the number of degrees of freedom . and when we merge the _ fuse _ spectrum together with the _",
    "hst_/stis spectrum we actually increase the number of degrees of freedom . since _ fuse _ and stis are binned differently and have different errors , one can not compare the least chi square best fit model obtained by fitting the _ fuse _ spectrum alone with the least chi square best fit model obtained when fitting the stis spectrum alone or the combined _",
    "fuse_+stis spectrum .",
    "these fits can not be compared on the basis of their @xmath73 values , as the same synthetic model will lead to different @xmath73 values when fitting the _ fuse _ spectrum alone , the stis spectrum alone , or the combined _ fuse_+stis spectrum .",
    "so the analysis of the _ fuse _ , stis and the combined _ fuse_+stis spectra are carried out separately .    for each single value of @xmath65",
    "there exists only one value of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , since we use the mass radius relation for wds ( e.g. @xcite or @xcite for different composition and non - zero temperature wds ) . as a consequence , when fitting the theoretical flux to the observed flux , the distance to the system is obtained as an output parameter when scaling the fluxes .",
    "when the wd mass and distance of a system are known , the fitting technique leads to only one precise value of the wd temperature . in the present case , since neither the mass nor the distance are known , the best fit model consists actually of a whole domain in the @xmath65-@xmath77 plane . because of that we fix the wd mass to @xmath78 ( for the wd models ) and use the @xmath79 models from the grid of accretion disk models .",
    "we then chose the lowest @xmath12 model ( best fit ) and obtain as output the wd temperature ( or the mass accretion rate ) and the distance to the system .",
    "since the reddening is also not known accurately , the choice @xmath80 helps us limit the number of solutions to a single table .",
    "we first tried a single white dwarf model , then an accretion disk alone , and then a combination of both for the _ fuse _ spectrum alone , then for the _ hst_/stis spectrum alone and then for the combined _ fuse _ + _ hst/_stis spectrum . .",
    "we note that if we do not deredden the observed spectra , they are basically impossible to fit with our synthetic spectral models",
    ".      the best solar composition wd model fit we found to the dereddened _ fuse _ spectrum of v794 aql assuming e(b - v)=0.1 has an effective temperature of 44,000k , a rotation rate of 200km@xmath17sec@xmath6 and a distance of 301pc .",
    "this model is shown in figure 4 and listed in table 5 .",
    "the wd model has some absorption features ( around 1120 - 1130 ) not present at all in the observed spectrum . in order to try and improve the fit",
    ", we decrease the abundances of c and si ( responsible for these absorption feature ) to 0.01 their solar value and kept all the other abundances solar .",
    "this provides a 10 percent reduction in the @xmath73 value ( table 5 ) .",
    "next we ran the fitting subroutine on the grid of accretion disk models and found that the fitting is slightly better for the disk than for the wd .",
    "the best fit accretion disk models are also listed in table 5 for the @xmath81 and @xmath82 cases .",
    "the mass accretion rate we obtained is rather large ( @xmath83yr@xmath6 ) and the distance is much larger than for a wd model , namely @xmath84pc . in figure 5",
    "we show the best fit accretion disk model with @xmath82 and @xmath85yr@xmath6 .",
    "the inclination angle we obtained is 60 degrees .",
    "in fact for all the disk models we found in the present work , the best fit is obtained for the higher inclination .",
    "this comes from the fact that the slope of the continuum is better matched by a rather flat continuum , which is obtained naturally with a higher inclination .",
    "a flatter continuum can also be obtained by dereddening the spectrum assuming a higher e(b - v ) value , which is what we did next .",
    "we ran our fitting subroutine for the wd and accretion disk models assuming now e(b - v)=0.2 , and dereddening the _ fuse _ spectrum of v794 aql accordingly .",
    "we found that the @xmath73 value decreases by about 20 percent for all the models .",
    "however , now the best wd model has a temperature of 51,000k ( since the spectrum is now `` bluer '' ) and a distance of 200pc .",
    "the best wd model fit assuming low c and si abundances is presented in figure 6 ( see also table 5 ) . for the best accretion disk model we found a slightly higher mass accretion rate ( @xmath86yr@xmath6 ) than for the e(b - v)=0.1 case , and a distance @xmath87pc . here",
    "again the best fit is for the accretion disk models .",
    "the @xmath88 model ( figure 7 ) only marginally better than the @xmath89 model ( all the models are listed in table 5 ) .",
    "next we ran two - component ( disk+wd ) model fits to find whether the fitting can be improved , but we found that the least @xmath73 obtained for the two - component is never smaller than the least @xmath73 obtained for the disk alone .    from the _ fuse _ spectrum alone , we find that the best fit model is that of an accretion disk with a high accretion rate , in agreement with the fact that v794 aql was caught in a rather high state .",
    "the distance inferred from the modeling is pretty large @xmath90pc , consistent with the assumption of a large reddening value ( 0.2 ) and with the rather low _ fuse _ flux for a high state .",
    "next we carried out exactly the same analysis but for the _ hst_/stis spectrum of v794 aql , assuming both e(b - v)=0.1 and e(b - v)=0.2 .",
    "for easy comparison all these results are also listed in table 5 .",
    "the main difference with the _ fuse _ results is that the temperature of the best wd model is 6,000k higher for the e(b - v)=0.1 case and 4,000k higher for the e(b - v)=0.2 case .",
    "the distance for the wd models is about the same , namely d=200 - 300pc . for the e(b - v)=0.1 case , the best accretion disk model ( figure 8) has a slightly smaller mass accretion rate ( @xmath91yr@xmath6 ) than for the _ fuse _ best fit which leads to about half the distance obtained for the _ fuse _ spectrum with the same reddening value .",
    "for the e(b - v)=0.2 case we obtained exactly the same best accretion disk solution as for the _ fuse _ spectrum . the best fit wd model ( for e(b - v)=0.2 )",
    "is presented in figure 9 and the best fit accretion disk model ( for e(b - v)=0.2 ) is presented in figure 10 .",
    "note that for all the stis spectral fits the @xmath73 values for the disk models are significantly smaller than for the best wd models , namely : @xmath73=13.25 versus 21.65 for the e(b - v)=0.1 case , and @xmath73=9.63 versus 13.65 for the e(b - v)=0.2 case .",
    "this is an indication that from the stis spectrum alone , the accretion disk is unambiguously the best model fit , and that e(b - v)=0.2 might be the correct value for the reddening . here too the two - component ( disk+wd ) model did not lead to a better fit .      in order to combine the _ fuse _ spectrum with the stis spectrum we check how well their fluxes match in the overlap region between about 1150and 1180 . at very short wavelengths",
    "stis is very noisy , and the longer wavelengths of _ fuse _ are represented only by one channel ( because of the worm ) and are , therefore , less reliable too .",
    "consequently , we are left only with the @xmath51 emission region and its immediate vicinity .",
    "we find that the spectra have the same flux level there and can therefore be combined together .",
    "again we ran our fitting subroutine , but now for the combined _",
    "fuse_+stis spectrum of v794 aql .",
    "this time we found that the temperature for the best wd model fit is much lower than for the individual spectra , namely 30,000k for the e(b - v)=0.1 case and t=45,000k for the e(b - v)=0.2 case ( shown in figure 12 ) with a distance of only d=145 - 176pc .",
    "for the e(b - v)=0.1 case ( figure 11 ) , we found the same accretion disk solution as for the stis spectrum , while for the e(b - v)=0.2 case ( figure 13 ) we found the same accretion disk solution as for the _ fuse _ and stis spectra alone .",
    "again the lowest @xmath73 values were obtained for the accretion disk models . again",
    "the e(b - v)=0.2 solutions were better than the e(b - v)=0.1 solutions , and here too the two - component ( disk+wd ) model did not lead to a better fit .",
    "since the _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra were obtained in a relatively high state , we could not get much information on the wd itself . in order to try and gain some knowledge of the wd",
    "directly we decided to model the _ iue _ spectrum swp 15266 of v794 aql in a relatively low state . in this state",
    "we expect to see mainly the wd and therefore we model the spectrum with a @xmath89 wd to agree with the grid of accretion disk models . since the spectrum is pretty noisy , more than one temperature is obtained and to limit the number of solution we fixed the distance to d@xmath92200pc and d@xmath92600pc and dereddened the spectrum assuming e(b - v)=0.20 .",
    "the best fit model for the shortest distance consists of a wd alone with t=30,000k , with @xmath73= 5.17 and a distance of 244pc .    for the larger distance the best fist consists of a wd plus and accretion disk model ( figure 14 ) .",
    "the wd has t=47,000k and the disk has @xmath93yr@xmath6 , i=41deg .",
    "this best model has a distance of 643pc and @xmath73=4.52 . in this model",
    "the wd contributes 56 percent of the flux and the accretion disk contributes the remaining 44 percent .",
    "if this temperature is correct , then we have to reject the wd models from table 5 with @xmath94 for e(b - v)=0.20 ; this would be the wd model for the combined _",
    "fuse_+stis spectrum for ( e(b - v)=0.20 ) with a temperature of only 45,000k , as this would be inconsistent , namely the system during the higher state can not have a temperature lower than during quiescence ( implying @xmath95 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the fuv spectra of v794 aql observed in a relatively high state with _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis and found evidence for the presence of a hot accretion disk accreting at a high rate .",
    "the spectra exhibit some broad emission lines ( @xmath96 , @xmath51 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , a clear sign of a hot gas where a high rotational velocity in a disk might be responsible for the broadening of these lines .",
    "we were limited in our spectral analysis by the large number of unknown parameters ( distance , wd mass , inclination , reddening , wd temperature , .. ) and decided to limit the search of solution assuming @xmath97 .",
    "for the _ fuse _ , stis and _ fuse_+stis spectra of v794 aql , we found that the accretion disk model provides a better fit to the observed spectra , which is not surprising since the system was observed in a relatively high state when the contribution of the disk is dominant .",
    "the best fit model had a mass accretion rate of @xmath98yr@xmath6 and an inclination of 60 degrees , assuming a mass @xmath80 .",
    "the distance we obtained was @xmath99pc and in all the cases the least @xmath73 was obtained for e(b - v)=0.2 .",
    "we also found that v794 aql is moderately affected by the ism with a molecular hydrogen column density of @xmath39@xmath1 and an atomic hydrogen column density of @xmath40@xmath1 .",
