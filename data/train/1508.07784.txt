    "the main motivation to our work comes from recent progress concerning the role of dark solitons in the physics of the gas with contact interaction only .",
    "first , let us remind , that solitons are localized waves propagating through non - linear media without any spreading and also moving through each other without changing the shape . among equations of broad interest for physicists ,",
    "there are a few which exhibit solitons .",
    "one of them is the non - linear one dimensional schrdinger equation : @xmath0 in which one can find bright ( the case with attracting forces , @xmath1 ) and dark ( the repulsive case @xmath2 ) solitons .",
    "the eq . applies , among others , to the dynamics of bosons interacting via a @xmath3-like potential , i.e. the interaction potential between two bosons @xmath4 is equal to @xmath5 . in this context , the eq .",
    "is only an approximation valid in the variously defined weak interaction limit @xcite .",
    "such a gas of bosons , can be described by more fundamental many - body model , the lieb - liniger model , which has been used to find rigorously the ground state @xcite as well as the elementary excitations @xcite .",
    "it turns out , that there are two branches of elementary excitations , staying on the same footing .",
    "the first branch has been identified as the bogoliubov excitations .",
    "the second one , consisting of the so called `` type ii '' excitations , within research performed by the next generations of physicists turned out to be solitonic branch @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that the dark solitons , as the elementary excitations , appear spontaneously in a gas at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the equation , is not capturing many important and common situations , even in the weakly interacting limit .",
    "for example , it is neglecting possible external traps in which the gas is confined , and it is assuming contact interaction only . in particular , it misses the gas with a dipolar interaction , which is recently studied in more and more laboratories @xcite . among many motivations to study",
    "the dipolar gas is definitely its unusual excitation spectrum , which in certain situations , close to instabilities , can have local minimum for non - zero quasi momenta , so called roton spectrum @xcite .",
    "it seems natural to ask if here is a place for the second branch and from what excitations it can be build . up to our knowledge",
    ", there is no study of the elementary excitation spectrum beyond the bogoliubov approximation , neither by solving the underlying many body problem , nor on the mean field level .",
    "moreover , although the literature about the bright solitons is very reach ( see parts of the review @xcite ) , relatively little is known about dark solitons . for the time being the shapes of dipolar solitons in a gas with both contact and dipolar interaction has been presented @xcite . surprisingly , the life time of the dark solitons can be increased , with some tricks even in the higher dimensional space @xcite .",
    "the dark solitons in non - local nonlinear media were the subject of research in optics .",
    "it has been found that two optical dark solitons interact with each other via non - trivial potential , they can even form a bound state @xcite . in this context , although the effective forces between photons can be non - local , it is always assumed that they are not long - range .    within this work , limited to the mean field description ,",
    "we look closer at the basic properties of the dark solitons in the dipolar media . the aim of this paper is to study dark dipolar solitons and contrast them with the true solitons existing in the gas with contact interaction only .",
    "the analysis is performed within the mean field description , but we include also the finite temperature case .",
    "we start with the detailed description of our model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",

    "and the @xmath6 directions ( called transverse directions ) , and a long box with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the dipole moments of the constituent atoms are polarized along @xmath8 axis , such that they mostly repel each other .",
    "[ fig : fig1],width=328 ]    we assume that the dipolar gas is confined in the potential @xmath9 with a tight harmonic trap in the @xmath8 and the @xmath6 directions .",
    "the space in the @xmath7 direction is assumed to be finite , with the length @xmath10 and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these conditions impose a quantization of the momenta @xmath11 in this direction , @xmath11 is a multiple of @xmath12 .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the box units , where @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the units of length , time , energy and temperature , respectively .",
    "we assume that the dipole moments of the constituent atoms are polarized along the @xmath8 axis , namely when the dipolar potential in the momentum space has the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a dipolar coupling strength .",
    "thus , the atoms move on the circumference of a circle , having the dipole moments perpendicular to the circle - plane . in this configuration",
    "dipoles mostly repel each other , what favors the dark solitons .",
    "the geometry of our problem is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]",
    ".    we will investigate the system within the mean field model .",
    "the time - dependent mean field wave - function obeys the three dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xmath18 we assume that the transverse confinement is so tight , that the wave - function stays in the lowest energy level in the @xmath8 and @xmath6 directions , namely when the following single - mode approximation holds : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gaussian wave function : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse oscillator width .",
    "the necessary condition underlying this approximation is that both , the thermal energy @xmath23 and the interaction energy , are much below the energy of the first excited state in the transverse direction .",
    "@xmath24 assuming such a situation we multiply the three dimensional gpe by @xmath25 , integrate the result with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 and finally we reach the one dimensional effective gpe @xmath28 the fourier transform of the effective one dimensional dipolar potential @xmath29 reads @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath34 which appears in eq . is equal to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the exponential integral . in this paper",
    "we aim at studying the role of pure dipolar interactions only , hence from now on , we will assume @xmath37 . ]",

    "[ fig : fig2],width=328 ]    it is worth stressing that eq",
    ". describes not a movement of single dipoles , but rather the movement of slices of the dipolar gas as marked in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "if such slices are far from each other , then the details of the distribution of dipoles within such slices plays no role , and we can treat them as single large dipoles . in such situations",
    "the interaction between them scales as @xmath39 . the situation changes , when the distance between them is of the order of the transverse width @xmath40 .",
    "this gives the characteristic range of the effective 1d potential .",
    "finally in the limit of slices going to the same place , the effective dipolar potential converges to a constant .",

    "the blue dashed line corresponds to experimental - like parameters : the mass and the dipole moment of dysprosium , assuming @xmath46 atoms and the transverse trap equal to @xmath47khz .",
    "[ fig : fig3],width=328 ]    in the gas with contact interaction only , the phase of a solitonic wave function is changing by @xmath48 around the region with minimal density .",
    "this motivates us to look for the solitons in the dipolar gas within the wave function which minimizes the energy but under constraint of a jump of the phase equal to @xmath48 .",
    "if we only force the jump of the phase equal to @xmath48 , then the periodic boundary condition would not be satisfied . hence , except the @xmath48 jump required by the soliton , we add to the constraint on the phase a linearly changing function of the position : @xmath49 such that the phases at the edges of the box are equal . due to this additional term",
    "the gas is moving with the speed @xmath50 .",
    "when showing the result for the dynamics , we would unrotate this motion .    to find the state with the lowest energy but with the phase equal to the constraint we use the method of the imaginary time evolution , forcing at each step the phase .",
    "densities computed with this method for three different aspect ratios @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we compare these profiles with the density of a dark soliton from purely contact interacting case @xcite marked in fig [ fig : fig3 ] with the thick gray line . as in both cases ,",
    "a contact interacting gas and the considered here quasi@xmath54d dipolar gas , the lowest lying excitations are phonons , then comparing their speed of sound we translate the dipolar coupling coefficient @xmath55 into an effective coupling coefficient @xmath56 .",
    "we find @xmath57 .",
    "the speed of sound in the dipolar media is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "the width of the shabat - zakharov soliton is proportional to the healing length , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the effective scattering length defined by the relation @xmath61 .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is supposed to be valid in the weakly interacting limit , namely when @xmath62 , what implies @xmath63 .",
    "one can see that the more elongated is the trap , the closer is the result to the soliton in contact interacting gas , marked in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] with the thick gray line . to understand this observation mathematically",
    "we look at the system in the momentum space .",
    "the range of the effective dipolar potential in the momentum space is equal to @xmath64 , equal in the box units to @xmath65 .",
    "hence , in the limit of a very elongated trap , @xmath66 the range of the effective potential is going to @xmath67 , and the evolution is dominated by its values relatively close to @xmath68 .",
    "the derivative of the effective potential eq . at @xmath68",
    "vanishes , what means that the potential is flat at the origin .",
    "thus locally , where this local region spans even to high momenta , the interaction potential looks like a constant function , as it would be in the contact interacting case . the ratio between the typical width of the soliton and the range of the potential , written in the momentum space and in the box units is equal to @xmath69 .",
    "thus if the trap is very elongated and the coupling strength is small , we expect that the dipolar soliton will be close to the shabat - zakharov solution and moreover that our system will evolve similarly to the gas with contact interactions only .    . in the laboratory frame",
    "the solitons travel around the circle @xmath70 times .",
    "parameters : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , as in the dysprosium like case commented in caption of fig .",

    "the horizontal red line is at time @xmath74 : a time at which a single phonon would pass the whole box .",
    "[ fig : fig4],width=328 ]    the presented solutions are only candidates for solitons , having similar jump of the phase as the shabat - zakharov solitons .",
    "the crucial feature of solitons is their ability to propagate without changing their shape . to verify",
    "if this is the case also here , we were setting as initial states the results of the imaginary time evolution , and trace their dynamics obtained via numerical solution of gpe .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where we unrotated the constant speed due to the linear dependance of the phase .",
    "the evolution time in this figure is about @xmath75 times longer than a time @xmath76 at which a phonon would travel across the whole box .",
    "when testing the system in a wide parameter range and for a longer evolution time we always observe the dips which propagate without noticable distortion .",
    "parameters as in fig [ fig : fig3 ] . [ fig : fig5],width=328 ]    the real solitons obey an equivalent of the superposition principle : although the system is non - linear one can construct many solitonic solution based on a single one .",
    "as shown in the paper of shabat and zakharov @xcite in the contact interacting gas two solitons , when colliding , do not change the shape . to test",
    "if the dipolar solitons can behave similarly , we generate and propagate pairs of them .",
    "we follow the method described for a single soliton , but this time we enforce two jumps of the phase , at positions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and without linear background @xmath79 having such constraint on the phase we reach with the help of the imaginary time evolution two solitons and then we propagate them using gpe .",
    "an example of such dynamics is shown in fig [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that the dipolar solitons interact , in the example shown they attract each other .",
    "hence , the excitations we study are not solitons in the strict mathematical sense .",
    "even though , these excitations resemble the shape for a long evolution times , thus we will use the name soliton - like or , for brevity , even the name soliton .     for different initial states .",

    "we estimated the temperature of each sample using formulas for average number of motionless particles , i.e. @xmath137 , for the ideal gas @xcite .",
    "as the crosscheck , we compute what would be fluctuation of the latter average in the ideal gas and compare it with the previously numerically found @xmath140 .",
    "the agreement was within a few percent , hence we concluded that : 1 ) the interactions in the gas are still so small that the statistics seems close to the ideal gas case and 2 ) our estimation for temperature is reasonable within a few percent .",
    "we also estimated the energy of dark solitons , relying on the formulas for the gas with contact interactions only @xcite as done in the previous sections .",
    "this gives the estimation for the energy of the dipolar dark soliton @xmath141 ( in box units ) .",
    "finally , having the estimated energy of the dark soliton , and estimated temperature of each sample we computed the estimated number of dark solitons @xmath142 , assuming their equipartition as it should be for quasiparticles .",
    "this expected number of solitons is given by the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] .",
    "we also repeat all the steps for the gas with the contact interaction only .",
    "we investigated the dipolar gas confined in the potential having the shape of a long tube , with the dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the long axis . in this geometry",
    "we find robust localized excitations , very similar to the shabat - zakharov solitons appearing in the gas with contact interaction only .",
    "in contrast to the contact interacting case , pairs of these soliton - like dipolar excitations mutually interact , and are able to form two - soliton bound states .",
    "moreover , the collisions between such pairs are not elastic : during collision they emit phonons , hence they loose energy and because of this they accelerate .",
    "after thousands of subsequent collisions they can reach dynamical equilibrium with the already emited quasiparticles .",
    "finally we show that these excitation appear spontaneously at finite temperatures and their number obeys thermal statistics .",
    "the latter observation is closely related to the contact interacting case , where the appearance of the dark solitons at the non - zero temperatures is an evidence that they are the non - bogoliubov elementary excitations , predicted by elliot lieb in 1963 .",
    "there are many open questions concerning these excitations .",
    "one should check their stability in the real three dimensional calculation .",
    "it is interesting if they exist also in the roton regime .",
    "there is the question of the effect of a harmonic trap along the long axis ( here the box with periodic boundary was assumed ) .",
    "one needs also benchmarks from other methods used for the finite - temperature simulations , as they are quite developed for the dipolar gases @xcite .",
    "probably the most important task would be a verification if these excitations are really elementary and if they are present in the many - body model .",
    "we are grateful to t. karpiuk , t. sowiski , p. deuar and m. gajda for valuable discussions .",
    "the work was supported by the ( polish ) national science center grant no .",

    "in the bogoliubov method one approximates the grand canonical hamiltonian with @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the bogoliubov spectrum and the operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the annihilation and creation bosonic ladder operators for quasiparticles , respectively . the operator @xmath145 , annihilating a quasiparticle with quasi - momenta @xmath147 is related to the bosonic operators @xmath148 annihilating a particle with a given momenta @xmath147 via relation : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 . in the classical version ,",
