    "at the tau-04 workshop , i summarized  @xcite the recently completed brookhaven e821 muon anomalous magnetic moment measurements and described a proposal for an extension of the measurement program .",
    "the e969 experiment  @xcite is designed to build on the existing infrastructure at bnl by beamline and ring improvements aimed at increasing the storable muon fraction and , simultaneously , reducing unwanted hadronic background .",
    "the goal is a reduction in the uncertainty of @xmath1(expt ) by a factor of 2 or more . over the past two years",
    ", the proposal plans have been scrutinized and updated .",
    "the technical plan is more complete and a prototype of one of the new detector concepts has been built and tested . during the same period , significant progress has been made in the standard model theory evaluation , as demonstrated here at tau-06 by many authors .",
    "the standard model expectation for the muon anomaly is based on qed , hadronic and weak loop contributions .",
    "passera  @xcite reviewed the present status and introduced special topics , which were expanded on by others .",
    "nio  @xcite described an ambitious effort to complete qed calculations through 10th order .",
    "vainshtein  @xcite focussed on the evaluation of the hadronic light - by - light ( hlbl ) contribution , whose present uncertainty at 0.2 - 0.3  ppm will become significant on the scale of the experimental goals . but the present dominant theory uncertainty is associated with the data - driven determination of the 1st - order hadronic vacuum polarization ( hvp ) . in particular , the nagging question of why the tau hadronic decay data does not agree with the direct @xmath0 annihilation approach",
    "was raised .",
    "the problem is evident in the `` single number '' test to determine the @xmath3 branching ratio .",
    "the tau result is 4.5 standard deviations higher than that predicted by cvc from @xmath0 data  @xcite .",
    "isospin corrections  @xcite and the general qcd compatibility of tau and @xmath0 data at higher energies  @xcite were presented , but no resolution of the problem was offered .",
    "the @xmath0-based hvp situation featured new results  @xcite from the novosibirsk vepp-2 m experiments cmd-2 and snd .",
    "both independently measure the @xmath4 cross section below the @xmath5 resonance . after adjusting for several subtle mistakes in the radiative correction procedures , both experiments are in excellent agreement . complementing this direct data is the radiative return method where the @xmath6 and @xmath7 beams in a collider are fixed in energy and the center - of - mass collision energy is reduced by the initial - state radiation . to establish the predictive spectrum of such collisions",
    "requires a radiative correction analysis , which is made possible by the phokhara monte carlo generator  @xcite .",
    "data sets requiring this treatment come from babar  @xcite and kloe  @xcite .",
    "so far , the babar results have mainly focussed on the high - mass region where they have improved knowledge of various exclusive many - body channels .",
    "the important @xmath8 cross section near the @xmath9 resonance is a particular challenge since the required precision to be competitive is at the sub - percent level .",
    "kloe is focussing on just this region and it is well known that their initial report  @xcite , which agrees in the integral with the direct annihilation measurements , is incompatible in spectral shape .",
    "venanzone described much larger data sets that have more robust built - in cross checks ( e.g. , small- and large - angle sensitivity to the radiated gamma so the events can be sorted in different kinematical regions ) .",
    "these data are being analyzed  @xcite at present and we can expect results by the next tau workshop .    because the hvp contributions drive the uncertainty on the standard model prediction , @xmath1(sm ) , davier summarized  @xcite the situation regarding the hadronic tau decays , radiative return techniques and the new direct @xmath0 measurements .",
    "his conclusions on hvp and the other standard model contributions are compiled in table  [ tab : theory ] .",
    "the total theoretical uncertainty is 0.48  ppm , to be compared with 0.54  ppm from the experiment .",
    "the theory uncertainty is the smaller  and , the work described here promises that it will be reduced even further in the coming years .",
    "the comparison of experiment to theory yields @xmath10 a @xmath11 effect , which hints strongly of some kind of new physics contribution .",
    "is there a more significant indicator anywhere ? if we allow that massive neutrinos are now built into an updated standard model , then the answer is `` no . ''",
    "but , this conclusion carries a number of assumptions .",
    "it is based on a relatively new evaluation of the hvp , which omits the first results from kloe using the radiative return method and all the hadronic tau data  @xcite .",
    "the selection made is meant to choose precise , consistent data sets and it favors the direct annhilation over an indirect technique that requires corrections .",
    "why the hadronic tau decay approach disagrees so sharply with the direct @xmath0 method is not understood , and the subject lingers as one of the most important unsolved problems that this community should try to address .",
    "the tau - based hvp data determine an @xmath1   that is much closer to experiment , so it is clearly important to understand .",
    "we are lead to dismissing it for now by the tau proponents  @xcite who argue that uncertainties in the treatment of isospin corrections , perhaps manifest by the spectral shape inconsistency between tau and @xmath0 data , are uncertain at the required level of accuracy .",
    "further , the cvc test fails miserably .",
    "something is not right and the confusion clouds the stated theoretical @xmath1  as quoted . if the standard model is accurately represented by the @xmath0 data , then the @xmath12  test is very suggestive of new physics .",
    "based on this interpretation  it is not a guarantee , only a very good bet  the collaboration feels strongly that a compelling motivation to improve the @xmath1measurement exists .",
    "of course it is imperative to resolve the tau issue and to corroborate the direct @xmath0 data with at least one of the radiative return methods from kloe , babar or belle ; but , this work continues and we can expect results in the near term .",

    "why do we need the new bnl muon g-2 experiment now ?",
    "the reasons are clear :    * the experiment can be improved by at least a factor of 2 but it must be started `` now '' to be ready when the results from the lhc will demand additional constraints .",
    "several years of r@xmath13d and construction are required before running and analysis can begin .",
    "we estimate roughly @xmath14 years from project start to achieve the goal . *",
    "the standard model theory uncertainty is already slightly smaller than experiment and it should be halved again over the next few years .",
    "the improvements have been driven by the fact that real measurements of @xmath1  were also being made . the momentum should be sustained and new efforts , especially related to the difficult hadronic light - by - light contribution , must be encouraged .",
    "it is quite likely that the next sophisticated step will employ lattice qcd techniques .",
    "* we are already at a compelling moment .",
    "the present ( @xmath0-based theory ) is 3.3 standard deviations from the experiment , providing a strong hint of new physics .",
    "if the current discrepancy of @xmath15 persists , with halved experimental and theoretical uncertainties , the significance will rise to @xmath16 .",
    "* for specific models , such as susy , @xmath1  is particulary effective at constraining @xmath17the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values  for a given superparticle mass .",
    "this information will be complementary to the anticipated lhc new - particle spectra and it will be crucial in the effort to pin down the parameters of the theory behind them . * independently of susy  we do not suggest or depend on this or any other specific model as being correct  measuring @xmath1  to very high precision will register an important constraint for any new physics theory to respect .",
    "some models will predict a large @xmath12 effect , while others will not .",
    "it is information that can likely help diagnose new physics .",
    "* on the practical side , the project is based on a proven track record by an existing team of experts and new enthusiastic collaborators .",
    "it is efficient to mobilize the collaboration now while the ring and beamline facilities can be dependably re - commissioned , and while the diverse expertise exists .",
    "the @xmath12   experiment is supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the u.s",
    ". national science foundation , the german bundesminister fr bildung und forschung , the russian ministry of science , and the us - japan agreement in high energy physics .",
