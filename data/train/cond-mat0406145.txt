    "small amounts of flexibility are predicted @xcite and observed @xcite to increase the stability of the isotropic phase and lead to a less ordered nematic phase . in this paper , we study the effects of flexibility on the isotropic - nematic ( i - n ) transition using suspensions of the rodlike charged , semiflexible m13 virus and m13 virus length - mutants . by varying the contour length ( @xmath0 ) of our experimental charged rods while maintaining a constant persistence length ( @xmath1 ) we change the rod flexibility ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the persistence length is defined as the length over which tangent vectors along a polymer are correlated @xcite . in our experiments",
    "the flexibility of the rods remains within the semiflexible limit , where @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of surface charge on the i - n transition of charged rods is also investigated .",
    "surface charge is varied by modifying both the surface chemistry of the rods and the solution chemistry , by changing ph .",
    "while onsager developed the original theory for the isotropic - nematic transition of hard and charged rigid rodlike particles , khokhlov and semenov were responsible for incorporating flexibility into this theory @xcite .",
    "they extended onsager s theory to include systems of semiflexible rods with a large length ( @xmath0 ) to diameter ( @xmath4 ) aspect ratio ( @xmath5 ) and arbitrary persistence length .",
    "they explicitly calculated the equilibrium properties of the i - n phase transition in the limit of very flexible @xmath6 and very rigid @xmath7 rods and interpolated between the two limits to find the properties of semiflexible rod phase behavior . shortly afterwards , chen numerically calculated the concentrations of the coexisting isotropic and nematic phases as well as the order parameter of the coexisting nematic phase for arbitrary flexibility using khokhlov - semenov theory@xcite . for rigid rods , the limit of stability of the isotropic phase is predicted to be @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number density and @xmath10 , the average excluded volume in the isotropic phase @xcite . for flexible rods , khokhlov - semenov theory predicts that slight semiflexibility will increase the stability of the isotropic phase by increasing @xmath11 , and will narrow the i - n coexistence region .",

    "past experiments have shown that @xmath21 accurately describes the ionic strength dependence of the i - n transition of _ fd _ virus suspensions @xcite .",
    "for highly charged rods , the effect of surface charge on @xmath19 is small as the non - linear nature of the poisson - boltzmann equation leads to counterion condensation near the colloid surface which renormalizes the bare surface charge to a lesser effective charge , which is nearly independent of the bare surface charge . in the nematic phase , the effective diameter increases due to an added effect called  twist \" which is characterized by the parameter @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the debye screening length .",
    "the effect of twist on @xmath19 , however , is predicted to be small for _ fd _",
    "@xcite , and we neglect it here . studying the influence of ionic strength and surface charge on the i - n phase behavior tests if @xmath19 can be accurately used to map charged rod phase behavior to hard - rod theories .",
    "onsager s theory is based on an expansion of the free energy truncated at the second virial level , so that only two - particle interactions are considered .",
    "this assumption has been shown to be accurate in the limit of very long rods , where @xmath24 @xcite , or for very dilute suspensions . in our experimental system , however , decreasing the ionic strength rapidly decreases our effective aspect ratio to values far below the @xmath25 limit . in order to accurately predict the phase behavior of rods with an effectively small aspect ratio , the theoretical free energy needs to incorporate third and higher virial coefficients .",
    "scaled particle theory ( spt ) , which incorporates all higher virial coefficients in an approximate way is one theory which accomplishes this@xcite . a scaled particle theory for hard rigid rods",

    "in this paper we present experimental measurements of the isotropic - nematic phase transition of semiflexible charged colloidal rods as a function of rod length , surface composition , solution ph , and solution ionic strength .",
    "we measure both the coexistence concentrations and the nematic order parameter and compare our results to both onsager s theory , by way of chen s numerical calculation@xcite , and scaled particle theory . for our model rods we use monodisperse suspensions of charged semiflexible rodlike _ fd _ virus , wild type m13 virus , and mutants of m13 virus which differ from the wild type only by their contour length . in solution ,",
    "these particles exhibit isotropic , cholesteric ( or chiral nematic ) , and smectic phases @xcite .",
    "suspensions of _ fd _ have been previously shown to exhibit an i - n transition which agrees with theoretical predictions for semiflexible rods with an effective diameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "m13 virus is structurally identical to _ fd _ virus , differing only in surface charge , making these two particles an ideal system for studying the influence of bare surface charge on the isotropic - nematic transition .",
    "additionally , by comparing the i - n phase behavior of each of the m13 mutants , which except for length are structurally identical , and therefore by assumption have the same persistence length , we measure the influence of flexibility , defined as the ratio @xmath2 on this transition .",
    "though _ fd _ and m13 exhibit a cholesteric phase , the free energy difference between the cholesteric and the nematic phase is much smaller than the difference between the isotropic and nematic phases  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compare our results to theoretical predictions for the isotropic - nematic ( i - n ) transition .",
    "we refer to the cholesteric phase as the nematic phase henceforth .",
    "motivation for these length and surface charge dependent measurements of the i - n transition arose because new measurements of the nematic - smectic ( n - s ) transition in this same system @xcite exhibit measurable surface charge dependence and ionic strength dependence which can not be accounted for by treating the virus as a hard rod with a diameter @xmath20 , in contrast to our previous measurements , which were limited in range of ionic strength @xcite .",
    "the new n - s measurements inspired a closer look at the ability of @xmath20 to describe the effects of surface charge on the i - n transition .",
    "new measurements of the n - s transition as a function of length also indicate that semiflexibility has no measurable effect on the n - s transition for the limited range studied , which is as predicted , but which is in sharp contrast to the large predicted effect of flexibility on the i - n transition for the same range .",
    "the measurements presented here of the i - n transition as a function of charge and flexibility will contribute to the understanding of the relative importance of these variables in the evolution of the liquid crystalline ordering of charged semiflexible rodlike particles with concentration .",
    "properties of _ fd _ and wild type m13 include length @xmath260.88 @xmath27 m , diameter @xmath28 nm , persistence length @xmath292.2 @xmath27 m and molecular weight @xmath30 g / mol@xcite .",
    "each virus consists of approximately 2700 coat proteins helicoidally wrapped around single stranded dna .",
    "the two viruses differ only by one amino acid per coat protein . in _",
    "fd _ this amino acid is the negatively charged aspartate ( asp@xmath31 ) , and in m13 it is the neutral asparagine ( asn@xmath31)@xcite .",
    "thus at near neutral ph _ fd _ has one more negative charge per coat protein ( @xmath32 e@xmath33/protein ) than m13 ( @xmath34 e@xmath33/protein ) , which results in a net charge difference of approximately 30% @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction studies are unable to clearly discern any structural differences between m13 and _ fd _ @xcite .",
    "the m13 length - mutants share the same properties as wild type m13 , varying only in length and molecular weight , which scales linearly with length .",
    "the m13 mutant have lengths of 1.2@xmath27 m , 0.64@xmath27 m , and 0.39@xmath27 m .",
    "wild type m13 , _ fd _ , and m13k07 ( the 1.2@xmath27 m mutant phage ) were grown using standard techniques @xcite .",
    "the other two mutant phages were grown using the phagemid method , which produces bidisperse solutions of the phagemid and the m13k07 helper phage @xcite .",
    "we chose two plasmid dna sequences , pgtn28 ( 4665bp ) and litmus38 ( 2820bp ) ( new england biolabs , cambridge ma ) to form our phagemids of length 0.64@xmath27 m and 0.39@xmath27 m , respectively .",
    "sample polydispersity was checked using gel electrophoresis on the intact virus , and on the viral dna . except for the phagemid solutions , which contained approximately 20% by mass helper phage m13k07 , the virus solutions were highly monodisperse as indicated by sharp electrophoresis bands .    in a bidisperse system of long and short rods",
    "it is predicted that when isotropic and nematic phases are in coexistence , the longer rods will strongly partition into the nematic phase @xcite . using this fractionation effect we attempted to purify the bidisperse suspensions of the phagemid and m13k07 helper phage .",
    "we observed partitioning of the long rods into the nematic phase by dna agarose gel electrophoresis ( 2 - 3 fold more long rods in the cholesteric phase than in the isotropic phase in qualitative agreement with lekkerkerker _",
    "@xcite ) , but were unable to successfully measure a difference in long rod concentrations in the isotropic phase after successive iterations of fractionation .",
    "the effect of fractionation on the coexistence concentrations was assayed by comparing the isotropic and nematic concentrations of coexisting samples ( about 50% of each phase in one sample ) with the highest concentrations for which the samples remained completely isotropic and the lowest concentrations for which the samples remained completely nematic , respectively .",
    "the only difference we observed was that the nematic concentration measured in coexistence with the isotropic phase was consistently about 5 - 10% lower than the nematic concentration measured when the sample was 100% nematic .",
    "the lower concentrations in the coexisting nematic phases are due to the partitioned long rods undergoing the i - n phase transition at lower mass concentrations . because the effect of bidispersity is small ,",

    "subsequently , khokhlov - semenov theory only qualitatively describes the experimental results at low ionic strength .",
    "agreement of the hard - rod khokhlov - semenov theory with our data is better at high ionic strength than at low ionic strength because the range of electrostatic interactions is weaker and @xmath58 is large , making the second virial approximation valid .    to interpret the observed increase in flexibility dependence of the phase transition with decreasing ionic strength , we turn to the scaled particle theory .",

    "[ bc.fig ] that spt indeed predicts a small dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath61 , in contrast to the @xmath61 independent second virial theory .",
    "this suggests that effective aspect ratio of the rods , which decreases with ionic strength , has a small effect on the i - n transition concentration .",
    "however , the @xmath61 dependence predicted by spt is opposite the trend experimentally observed ; increasing @xmath20 , by lowering ionic strength , increases the measured @xmath43 but lowers the scaled particle theory @xmath43 .",
    "we argue that this discrepancy between scaled particle theory and experimental results at low ionic strength is due to the approximate treatment of electrostatics in @xmath21 , which is used not only as the theoretical hard rod diameter in spt but also scales the experimental coexistence concentrations from @xmath47 to @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath20 is determined using from the second virial coefficient , and therefore is not necessarily accurate beyond that limit , ie . at low ionic strength .",

    "[ bc.fig ] , is much smaller than the measured change in @xmath43 with ionic strength .",

    "the value for the coexistence width is larger than predicted by both khokhlov - semenov theory and by scaled particle theory . at short rod lengths",
    "this discrepancy is most likely due to the intrinsic bidispersity of the suspensions , which acts to widen the coexistence region @xcite .",
    "a slow increase in the coexistence concentrations with time ( possibly due to bacterial growth ) @xcite contributes to the large error bars , making comparison to predictions difficult . above 10 mm ionic strength , where we see strong agreement between measurements of the coexistence concentrations and theoretical predictions , it is not apparent that there is any flexibility or ionic strength dependence in the width measurements .",
    "the nematic order parameter obtained from measurements of the birefringence of the magnetically unwound and aligned cholesteric phase in coexistence with the isotropic phase is presented in fig .",
    "[ insmutant.fig ] .",
    "we observe that at high ionic strengths , the nematic order parameter decreases with increasing length ( increasing flexibility ) in qualitative agreement with khokhlov - semenov theory calculated by chen @xcite . with decreasing ionic strength , however , the measured nematic order parameter increases , approaching onsager s rigid - rod predictions , due to increasing the range of electrostatic interactions .",
    "this has also been observed for _ fd _ virus suspensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at very low ionic strength ( 5 mm ionic strength ) the nematic order parameter becomes independent of rod length and equal to the predicted rigid rod value of @xmath64 .",
    "scaled particle theory , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ insmutant.fig ] , predicts that the nematic order parameter is largely independent of ionic strength .",
    "this suggests that the effective aspect ratio of the rods , which decreases with ionic strength , does not effect the nematic ordering .",
    "in addition , spt agrees with the experimental measurements at high ionic strength better than khokhlov - semenov theory .",
    "another possible explanation for an increase in nematic order parameter with decreasing ionic strength is electrostatic stiffening .",
    "if the interparticle interactions are dominated by electrostatics , the flexibility of the rods might be screened .",
    "this effective  electrostatic persistence length \" @xmath65 , which makes a charged polymer more rigid when in solution , is a dominant effect in determining the flexibility of charged flexible polymers with @xmath66 .",
    "however , for the semiflexible m13 and _ fd _ , @xmath65 is predicted to be less than one percent larger than the bare persistence length @xcite .",
    "additionally , the results for the coexistence concentrations presented in fig . [ bc.fig ] indicate that with decreasing ionic strength the measured coexistence concentrations deviate further from onsager s rigid - rod predictions .",
    "thus the measured coexistence concentrations and nematic order parameters exhibit contradictory trends , away from onsager s rigid rod prediction versus towards onsager s rigid rod prediction , respectively , with decreasing ionic strength .",
    "therefore , electrostatic stiffening of the polymer can not account for the observed high values of the order parameter at low ionic strength .",
    "neither scaled particle theory , nor variation in the electrostatic persistence length satisfactorily explain the low ionic strength data .      in this section",
    "we compare the phase behavior of m13 virus to that of _ fd _ virus as a function of surface charge and ionic strength .",

    "[ in.fig ] we confirm that the charge dependence of the i - n coexistence concentrations is accurately described by scaled particle theory at high ionic strengths . however , the efficacy of @xmath20 as a means for incorporating all electrostatic interactions again diminishes at low ionic strength ( i@xmath6960 mm ) , as seen previously in fig .",
