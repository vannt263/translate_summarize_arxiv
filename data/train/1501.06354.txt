    "<S> @xcite , which have demonstrated that the central exclusive @xmath165 production is dominated by the two - photon fusion . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that also in this case the signal of the dilaton production will be smaller than the background , in particular for large @xmath6 masses , since the cross section for the @xmath166 ( via @xmath2 ) process is weakly dependent on the invariant mass @xmath167 ( see fig . 14 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the @xmath2 and @xmath1 processes are separated by measuring the four - momentum transfers squared in the proton lines , as planned for future studies at atlas and cms , we have that the signal will be similar to the background associated to the @xmath166 ( via @xmath156 ) process . an alternative to search a massive dilaton in exclusive processes , </S>",

    "<S> comparing our results with the sm predictions presented in @xcite , we obtain that the signal will be larger than the background for large invariant masses of this final state . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the double higgs production in exclusive processes still is an open question , but it is expected to be very small . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the search of the dilaton considering its decay into a higgs pair can also be a promising way .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , lets summarize our main results and conclusions . in this paper we estimated , for the first time , the dilaton production in exclusive processes considering @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions , which are characterized by two rapidity gaps and intact hadrons in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> our goal was to verify if exclusive processes can be considered a viable alternative to the proposed searches of the dilaton in inclusive processes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to inclusive processes , where the incident hadrons dissociate and the final state is populated by a large number of particles , which makes the separation of the dilaton a hard task , in exclusive processes the incident hadron remains intact and the dilaton will be centrally produced , separated from the very forward hadrons by large rapidity gaps . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in exclusive processes the dilaton is expected to be produced in a clean environment . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the momenta of the outgoing hadrons are measured by forward detectors , the mass of the dilaton is expected to be reconstructed with very precise resolution . </S>",
    "<S> all these aspects have motivated the analysis performed in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered one of the possible scenarios which predicts the dilaton and could be analysed at lhc , in which the scale invariance of the strong dynamics is manifest at very high energy but is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath0 , not too above the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the identification of the dilaton provide a hint to the conformal nature of the strong sector . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the constraints in @xmath0 and @xmath6 from the higgs searches at lep and lhc , we have estimated the dilaton cross sections and event rates for the dilaton production induced by @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions in @xmath4 and @xmath8 collisions . for a dilaton with mass identical to the sm higgs , we predict larger cross sections in comparison to the sm higgs production in pomeron - pomeron interactions for @xmath118 tev , which is the minimal value of @xmath0 allowed for @xmath125 gev . at larger values of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton cross section becomes smaller than the higgs one due to its @xmath124 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for photon - photon interactions , the dilaton cross section is smaller to the sm higgs one for all allowed values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the main decay channels of the dilaton , we have compared our predictions with potential backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrated that for a light dilaton the signal - to - background ratio will be very small , which implies that the probe of a light dilaton in exclusive processes at lhc will be not possible . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our results indicated that for a massive dilaton , which can be produced if @xmath169 tev , the signal - to - background ratio will be favourable if the dilaton decay channels into @xmath162 and/or @xmath170 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> our main conclusion is that the study of exclusive processes can be useful to search a massive dilaton , as well as to constrain the mass and the conformal energy scale . </S>"
