    "since the pioneering work of shapley ( 1918 ) the properties of the galactic globular cluster system have been seen as valuable tracers of the structure and history of the galactic halo ( van den bergh 1995 ) .",
    "zinn ( 1985 ) , armandroff & zinn ( 1988 ) , and armandroff ( 1989 ) , on the basis of correlations between metallicity and kinematics , divided the globular cluster population of the galaxy into a halo and a disk system , the clusters of which have metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath6 and [ fe / h ] @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this has lead to a model in which the metal - richest globular clusters belong to a kinematically uniform disk system .",
    "this letter presents a new analysis of the kinematical and spatial properties of the highest - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) galactic globular clusters which shows that they may not constitute a homogeneous population . instead ,",
    "if these clusters are grouped on the basis of their mass , several subsystems can be identified .",
    "we have taken advantage of the april 1996 version of the _ catalog of parameters for milky way globular clusters _ compiled by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "this was obtained through the world wide web from the site ( url ) http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/globular.html .",
    "our kinematical analysis follows the lines of frenk & white ( 1980 , 1982 ) , zinn ( 1985 ) , and armandroff ( 1989 ) , but our approach differs from theirs in that we divide the metal - richest clusters into two subgroups according to cluster mass .",
    "throughout this paper a standard @xmath7 galactocentric coordinate system is adopted ( cf .",
    "mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",
    "the solar motion is taken to be in the direction @xmath8 57 , @xmath9 23 , with a velocity @xmath10 km / s ( zinn 1985 ) .",
    "the three components of the solar velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) are then @xmath11 km / s .",
    "the velocity of a globular cluster with respect to the lsr ( @xmath12 ) is computed from the above components of the solar motion and the heliocentric radial velocity of the cluster ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) . the radial velocity @xmath13 of a cluster with respect to a _ stationary _ observer at the location of the sun is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle between the apex of the lsr and the cluster s position on the sky , @xmath16 and the rotational velocity of the lsr is assumed to be 220 km / s .",
    "analysis of the bulk rotation of a system of globular clusters depends on that system s rotation curve . in the case of a constant systematic rotation speed @xmath17 without a global radial motion ( frenk & white 1980 )    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    @xmath20 is the line - of - sight peculiar velocity of a cluster , and @xmath21 is the cluster s galactocentric distance .",
    "the galactocentric distance of the sun is taken to be @xmath22 kpc . in the case of rigid - body rotation with a uniform angular velocity of @xmath23 ( kinman 1959 , zinn 1985 )    @xmath24    an unbiased estimate of @xmath17 can be obtained by the following sum over all clusters ( frenk & white 1980 ) :    @xmath25    with a similar equation for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath28 of the sample is determined by inserting @xmath17 or @xmath26 into equations 1 and 3 , respectively , and calculating the dispersion in @xmath20 .",
    "globular cluster masses @xmath29 were calculated from the integrated absolute visual magnitudes ( @xmath30 ) tabulated by harris ( 1996 ) . a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath31 was assumed ( chernoff & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "in this section we divide the metal - richest galactic globular clusters , which we take to be those with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 , into two mass groups : a _ high - mass _ group for which @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and a _ lower - mass _ group , containing clusters of mass smaller than this .",
    "the kinematical properties of these two groups are summarised in columns 2 and 3 of table  1 .",
    "the parameters listed include the number of clusters in each group @xmath34 , the rotation speed @xmath17 for the case of a flat rotation curve and the value of @xmath35 for the case of rigid - body rotation , as well as the standard deviations in these values .",
    "also given are the line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath28 , the mean height above the galactic plane @xmath36 , and the mean radial distance in the galactic plane @xmath37 for each group .",
    "with the caveat that the number of clusters is relatively modest , the entries in table  1 indicate that the kinematical properties of the high - mass and lower - mass clusters are different . while the high - mass clusters show little or no rotation , the low - mass clusters exhibit rotation with a significance level of @xmath38 .",
    "these results suggest that the high - mass clusters define a spheroidal inner - halo - like subsystem whereas the low - mass clusters represent a disk - like component .",
    "kinematical and spatial data for the lower - mass clusters are plotted in the upper and lower panels , respectively , of figure  1 .",
    "least - squares fits to the velocity data for the entire set of lower - mass clusters are shown as short - dashed lines in the upper panels .",
    "two groups of clusters can be distinguished in the top panels of figure  1 .",
    "one group ( open circles ) exhibits a relatively well - defined relationship between @xmath13 and both @xmath27 and @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining clusters are all within a small @xmath27 range ( @xmath41 ) and are represented by filled circles .",
    "these two groups are also relatively distinct in the lower panels of figure  1 . with the exception of ter 7 which is located at galactocentric",
    "coordinates @xmath42 kpc and probably belongs to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( da costa & armandroff 1995 ) , the group with small @xmath27 falls within a centrally concentrated , bar - like configuration that is extended in the @xmath43 direction and has @xmath44 ; the clusters in this group will be referred to as `` bar clusters . '' the remaining clusters ( open circles ) fall within a ring around the galactic center having an inner and an outer radius of @xmath45 4 and 6 kpc respectively ; these objects will be referred to as the `` 5-kpc - ring '' clusters .",
    "a bar - like feature in the space distribution of globular clusters was noted by woltjer ( 1975 ) and harris ( 1976 ) , who suggested that it could be an artifact of distance measurement errors for clusters in directions close to that of the galactic center .",
    "frenk & white ( 1980 ) performed monte carlo simulations to assess this possibility .",
    "they found that errors in distance moduli would have to be as large as 1.0 mag to explain the bar . whereas the accuracy of distance modulus measurements have increased since the time of woltjer s ( 1975 ) analysis",
    ", the bar is more prominent in figure  1 than in the data of woltjer , the opposite to what would be expected if the bar were an observational artifact .",
    "note that there is also strong evidence for a bar - like distribution of stars and molecular gas in the galactic bulge ( see the review by freeman 1996 ) .",
    "it is striking that the stellar bar has a very similar orientation , spatial distribution , and rotational velocity to the subsystem of `` bar clusters '' , indicating a common origin .",
    "separate least - squares fits were made to the velocity data for the subset of `` bar '' clusters and for the subset of `` 5-kpc - ring '' clusters .",
    "the results are given in columns 4 and 5 of table  1 , and the fits for the `` 5-kpc - ring '' subsystem are shown as long - dashed lines in figure  1 .",
    "two points deserve emphasis .    _",
    "( i ) _ the small range of @xmath27 for the _ bar clusters _ leads to large errors in @xmath35 if one assumes solid - body rotation .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath46 km / s / kpc for these clusters is in excellent agreement with zhao s ( 1994 ) estimated angular velocity of the central stellar bar of @xmath47 km / s / kpc .",
    "the assumption of rigid body rotation might therefore be the physically appropriate model for the `` bar clusters . ''",
    "it is interesting that all the clusters of the bar system have positive @xmath13 values .",
    "this bulk flow may indicate that the bar is a transient phenomenon .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ the _ 5-kpc - ring _",
    "clusters constitute a rapidly rotating subsystem , with only a small velocity dispersion .",
    "these clusters seem to be members of the galactic disk .",
    "the rotation speed at @xmath48 kpc , derived from the solid - body assumption ( upper - right panel of figure 1 ) is 120 km / s , which compares with 164 km / s under the assumption of a flat rotation curve .",
    "in addition , @xmath49 , indicative of a disk with well - organised rotation .",
    "this subgroup of `` 5-kpc - ring '' clusters has kinematics not greatly different from the old open cluster system of the galactic disk , which has a scale height of 375 pc ( janes & phelps 1994 ) and kinematics of @xmath50 km / s and @xmath51 km / s ( scott , friel , & janes 1995 ) .",
    "the difference in the rotation speeds of these two cluster systems may be partly related to the differences in their average age and galactocentric distance .    the lower - mass `` 5-kpc - ring '' globular clusters might represent `` missing links '' between the globular clusters of the halo and the open clusters of the galactic disk . as illustrated in figure  3 of hufnagel & smith ( 1994 ) , for example , no old open clusters are known with galactocentric distances of less than 7  kpc .",
    "it may be that old open clusters did not form within 7  kpc of the galactic center ; and that more populous globular - like clusters , like m71 , were instead formed in this region of the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , open clusters that formed at @xmath52  kpc may have been disrupted by interactions with molecular clouds .",
    "the objects more likely to survive this process would have been the higher - mass globular clusters .      the positional and kinematical data for those globular clusters having @xmath32 and [ fe / h ] @xmath0 are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the fact that @xmath53 indicates that the high - mass , metal - richest globulars are not members of a true rotating disk system .",
    "the formal solution of @xmath54 km / s is heavily weighted by the cluster ngc  104 ( 47  tuc ) with @xmath55 and @xmath56 km / s ; excluding this object would lead to counter - rotation with @xmath57 km / s for the remaining sample of clusters , further strengthening the conclusion that these clusters are not part of a rotating disk population .    rather than being members of the disk",
    ", these clusters may instead belong to a metal - enriched inner - halo component .",
    "the velocity dispersion among these clusters is not as large as for the system of more metal - poor galactic halo globular clusters .",
    "this result is in agreement with frenk & white ( 1980 ) who found that the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the halo cluster population increases significantly with galactocentric distance , indicating a non - isothermal cluster distribution function .",
    "the high - mass relatively - high - metallicity clusters might therefore be part of a more centrally condensed and kinematically cooler inner component of the galactic halo .",
    "formed at times when the interstellar medium in the proto - galaxy had experienced dissipational contraction and the metallicity had increased to relatively high values , these clusters may represent the last remnants from the true epoch of globular cluster formation in the galactic halo .",
    "a statistical investigation of the difference between the low - mass and high - mass clusters depicted in figures  1 and 2 , respectively , is affected by the low number ( 7 ) of high - mass clusters . to take account of this limitation",
    ", monte carlo simulations were performed in which random samples of seven clusters were generated from a population with given average rotational velocity @xmath58 and velocity dispersion @xmath59 similar to that of the low - mass clusters . for each sample",
    "generated , the average rotational velocity @xmath17 was calculated using equation 4 .",
    "the results for a large number of artificial samples were combined to give the probability that the rotation speed for such a sample is @xmath60 km / s , corresponding to rotation that is as slow as observed for the high - mass system of clusters .",
    "the data for each set of seven clusters were generated as follows : first , a value for @xmath40 was chosen , randomly distributed between @xmath61 and + 1 .",
    "the cluster velocities @xmath13 were then generated assuming a normal probability distribution function :    @xmath62 ^ 2 }                 { 2 \\ \\sigma_{pop}^2 } \\right)\\ ] ]    with values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 chosen to be representative of the low - mass system of clusters .    using this method",
    ", we find that there exists a 10% probability that the high - mass clusters are drawn from the same kinematical population as the combined sample of low - mass clusters .",
    "comparing the high - mass clusters and the low - mass bar clusters , we find a 51% probability that these two samples have similar kinematical properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity distributions of high - mass clusters and low - mass ring clusters are significantly different , with a probability of less than @xmath63 that both samples result from the same population .    in summary",
    ", we can rule out with a high probability that the high - mass clusters have an average rotational velocity and a velocity dispersion similar to the ring clusters .",
    "they appear to be two distinct subsystems .",
    "the relation of the bar clusters to the high - mass clusters is not clear from the present analysis .",
    "the similar kinematical properties of both subsystems ( assuming a constant rotational velocity ) suggests that they may be drawn from the same or related populations .",
    "however , the more extended spatial distribution of the high - mass clusters indicates that this subsystem is part of the inner halo .",
    "the origin of the bar clusters , on the other hand , is more likely related to the formation of the central stellar bar or bulge .",
    "the formation of the inner halo and galactic bulge / bar could also be coupled .",
    "we propose that the following three subsystems can be distinguished among the highest - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) globular clusters of the galaxy : _ i ) a centrally condensed halo subsystem of high - mass clusters , ii ) a bar subsystem of lower - mass clusters , and iii ) a rapidly - rotating disk subsystem of lower - mass clusters , many of which fall within a ring about the galactic center of radius 4 - 6 kpc . _",
    "these subsystems indicate that the population of relatively - high - metallicity globular clusters is more heterogeneous than has hitherto been expected from the concept of a single disk population .",
    "if the high - mass , higher - metallicity globular clusters really are members of the galactic halo as suggested above , then it follows that high - mass ( @xmath64 @xmath65 ) cluster formation only took place in the galactic halo , not in the disk .",
    "this suggests that the maximum mass of star clusters which formed in the galaxy may have decreased with time , perhaps along the lines of the following scenario .",
    "the halo supported massive cluster formation , possibly under starburst - like conditions in massive clouds ( murray & lin 1989 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ; brown et  al . 1995 ; burkert et  al .",
    "however , as the interstellar medium collapsed into the center and the equatorial plane and the metallicity built up , cluster formation tended to produce the low or intermediate - mass globular clusters ( @xmath66 ) found in the bar or the 4 - 6 kpc ring noted in figure  1 .",
    "as the disk built up further from the inside out , the sites of cluster formation propagated outwards through the disk into regions beyond 7  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the typical masses of clusters being formed at this time were markedly lower , with open clusters like ngc  6791 and ngc  188 being produced .",
