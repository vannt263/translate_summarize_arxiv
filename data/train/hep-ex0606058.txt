    "new very light spin - zero particles which are very weakly coupled to ordinary matter are predicted in many models beyond the standard model .",
    "such light particles arise if there is a global continuous symmetry in the theory that is spontaneously broken in the vacuum  a notable example being the axion  @xcite , a pseudoscalar particle arising from the breaking of a u(1 ) peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite , introduced to explain the absence of @xmath1 violation in strong interactions . such axion - like pseudoscalars couple to two photons via @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the coupling , @xmath4 is the field corresponding to the particle",
    ", @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the ( dual ) electromagnetic field strength tensor , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively",
    ".    in the case of a scalar particle coupling to two photons , the interaction reads @xmath9 both effective interactions give rise to similar observable effects .",
    "in particular , in the presence of an external magnetic field , a photon of frequency @xmath10 may oscillate into a light spin - zero particle of small mass @xmath11 , and vice versa .",
    "the notable difference between a pseudoscalar and a scalar is that it is the component of the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field that interacts in the former case , whereas it is the perpendicular component in the latter case .",
    "the exploitation of this mechanism is the basic idea behind photon regeneration ( sometimes called `` light shining through walls '' ) experiments  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_reg ] .",
    "namely , if a beam of photons is shone across a magnetic field , a fraction of these photons will turn into ( pseudo-)scalars . this ( pseudo-)scalar beam can then propagate freely through a wall or another obstruction without being absorbed , and finally another magnetic field located on the other side of the wall can transform some of these ( pseudo-)scalars into photons  apparently regenerating these photons out of nothing . a pilot experiment of this type",

    "[ fig : ax_ph],width=321 ]    recently , the pvlas collaboration has reported an anomalous signal in measurements of the rotation of the polarization of photons in a magnetic field  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ax_ph_lab_only ] ) .",
    "a particle with these properties presents a theoretical challenge .",
    "it is hardly compatible with a genuine qcd axion .",
    "moreover , it must have very peculiar properties in order to evade the strong constraints on @xmath3 from stellar energy loss considerations  @xcite and from its non - observation in helioscopes such as the cern axion solar telescope  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ax_ph ] ) .",
    "its production in stars may be hindered , for example , if the @xmath16 vertex is suppressed at kev energies due to low scale compositeness of @xmath4 , or if , in stellar interiors , @xmath4 acquires an effective mass larger than the typical photon energy , @xmath17  kev , or if the particles are trapped within stars  @xcite .    clearly , an independent and decisive experimental test of the pseudoscalar interpretation of the pvlas observation , without reference to axion production in stars ( see  @xcite ) , is urgently needed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of us ( ar ) was involved in the consideration of the possibility of exploiting powerful high - energy free - electron lasers ( fel ) in a photon regeneration experiment to probe the region where the pvlas signal could be explained in terms of the production of a light spin - zero particle .",
    "in particular , it was emphasized that the free - electron laser vuv - fel  @xcite at desy , which is designed to provide tunable radiation from the vacuum - ultraviolet ( vuv ; 10 ev ) to soft x - rays ( 200 ev ) , will offer a unique and timely opportunity to probe the pvlas result .",
    "notably , the high photon energies available at the vuv - fel increase substantially the expected photon regeneration rate in the mass range implied by the pvlas anomaly , in comparison to the one expected at visible ( @xmath18  ev ) lasers . in this letter of intent , we propose a corresponding photon regeneration experiment .",
    "the proposed experiment is based on the assumption that the vuv - fel can deliver photons with an energy @xmath19  ev and an average photon flux @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : vuvfel ] ) . for the proposed photon regeneration experiment at the vuv - fel",
    ", we study a linear arrangement of 12 normal conducting dipole magnets which are freely available at desy .",
    "each of these magnets has a magnetic field of @xmath21 t and an integrated magnetic length of @xmath22 m .",
    "the default arrangement consists of six plus six magnets , the beam absorber being placed between the first and second six .",
    "this arrangement corresponds to a magnetic field region of size @xmath23tm .",
    "the proposed configuration is too large to fit into the vuv - fel experimental hall .",
    "it has to be built on the ground before the entrance .",
    "correspondingly , the fel beam line has to be extended to the proposed experiment .",
    ".[tab : vuvfel ] achieved ( 2005 ) and expected ( 2007 ) vuv - fel parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the photons leave the vuv - fel with horizontal linear polarization .",
    "in order to have a maximal coupling with a possible pseudoscalar / scalar , the magnetic field @xmath24 of the magnets before the absorber should lie in the horizontal / perpendicular direction .",
    "we therefore foresee to exploit both possibilities of the magnetic field direction .    for the proposed experiment ,",
    "the expected flux of regenerated photons is @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the momentum transfer to the magnet and @xmath28 ^ 2\\ ] ] is a form factor which reduces to unity for small @xmath29 , corresponding to large @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "[ form_factor ] ) or small @xmath14 , @xmath30 for smaller @xmath10 or larger @xmath14 , incoherence effects set in between the ( pseudo-)scalar and the photon , the form factor getting much smaller than unity , severely reducing the regenerated photon flux  ( [ nf ] ) ( cf . fig .",
    "[ form_factor ] ) .",
    "therefore , a photon regeneration experiment exploiting the vuv - fel beam has a unique advantage when compared to one using an ordinary laser operating near the visible ( @xmath31  ev ) : the sensitivity of the former extends to much larger masses .",
    "in particular , the mass range  ( [ pvlas_mass ] ) implied by pvlas is entirely covered , for @xmath32  ev photons ( cf .",
    "( [ small_mass ] ) ) .    , eq .  ( [ formfactor ] ) , as a function of the laser frequency @xmath10 , for fixed length @xmath33  m of the magnetic field region and different values of the pseudoscalar mass @xmath14 , corresponding to the central value , @xmath34  mev ( solid ) , the lower value , @xmath35  mev ( short dashed ) , and the upper value , @xmath36  mev ( long dashed ) , of the range ( [ pvlas_mass ] ) suggested by pvlas .",
    "[ form_factor],width=321 ]    in case a signal is found , one may use the possibility to tune the photon energy for a determination of the mass of the particle .",
    "this is done by lowering the energy of the fel photons and observing the on - set of the incoherence expected around @xmath37 . a determination of the form factor @xmath38 as a function of @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "[ form_factor ] ) will allow an extraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the flux prediction  ( [ nf ] ) uses the benchmark values for the vuv - fel flux and for the proposed magnetic field arrangement . for @xmath3 and @xmath14 in the parameter region",
    "preferred by pvlas , eqs .",
    "( [ pvlas_coupling ] ) and ( [ pvlas_mass ] ) , this results in a rate of regenerated photons ranging from about 1 mhz up to 1 hz .",
    "the very low predicted rates require therefore a detector system with    * a large single photon efficiency at @xmath39  ev , * a short response time , * and a low noise rate .",
    "three detector options are being considered : electron multipliers , multi - channel plates , and avalanche photo diodes .",
    "one manufacturer quotes an efficiency of about 7% for electron multipliers . for the two other options , extrapolations point to a value of around 10% .",
    "all three detectors show a response time in the 10 ns range .",
    "this short response time allows a reduction of the noise rate by timing , exploiting the time structure of the photon beam .",
    "these detector performances , in particular the efficiencies and the response time , have to be studied at a beamline of the vuv - fel as soon as possible . at the same time",
    ", the general background rates in the vuv - fel environment have to be studied as well .    in the case of a non - observation of photon regeneration , for an assumed running time of @xmath40  h with an average photon flux of @xmath20 at @xmath19  ev , a 7% single photon efficiency and zero background , the proposed experiment can establish a 95% confidence limit of @xmath41 , for @xmath42  ev .",
    "in particular , the experiment is expected to be able to firmly exclude the particle interpretation of the pvlas anomaly and to improve the current laboratory bound on @xmath3 in the @xmath43  ev range ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ax_ph_lab_only ] ) .",
    "the proposed experiment offers a window of opportunity for a firm establishment or exclusion of the particle interpretation of the pvlas anomaly in the near future .",
    "it takes essential advantage of unique properties of the vuv - fel beam .",
    "the available vuv - fel photon energies are just in the range where the photon regeneration rate is most sensitive to the hypothetical particle s mass .",
    "moreover , the well - defined beam of the vuv - fel will not produce beam - related backgrounds .",
    "the experiment should be done soon , before other experiments  @xcite can compete .",
    "a first step towards this goal is the study of possible detectors and their background rates .",
