    ", we will consider pure states as initial states .",
    "an initially pure state remains pure at all times under the dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is well known that for pure states entanglement can quantify all quantum correlations between two two - level systems , while such an identification is complicated for mixed states and entanglement signifies only a particular type of quantum correlation  @xcite .",

    "these approximations are the qubit having degenerate basis states , the external field being constant or changed slowly , the field being oscillating with a frequency close to the resonance frequency of the energy splitting of a qubit so that rwa solutions exist , the field being perturbative and a sudden or series of fast pulses  ( kicks ) .",
    "the fast pulses are the most important limiting cases compared to the others because it was shown that they provide a full population transfer from one state to the other in a qubit  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fast pulse and pulses have many potential implementations for some quantum tasks , such as nmr , quantum gates , excitation of electronic states in molecules , chemical reactions and quantum computing  @xcite .",

    "so , we consider those states that can not be affected by longitudinal external fields and analyze their dynamics under a transverse field .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the effect of transverse field on the dynamics of the system which is initially in a separable , i.e. , @xmath53 or in a maximally entangled state  i.e. , @xmath54 . to see the effect of kicks on the entanglement dynamics for these initial states",

    "( [ conn ] ) ,  ( [ probability ] ) and  ( [ freeevolution ] ) , the initially separable state remains separable , while the concurrence for the initial bell state is equal to 1 at any time before the kick .",
    "that is , qubit - qubit interaction has no effect in the absence of external fields .",
    "here we consider two qubits whose states are strongly perturbed by three positive kicks applied at times @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the magnetic fields on qubits can be given as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are called integrated magnetic strengths  @xcite , and @xmath64 is the dirac delta function .",
    "for such a kick sequence , the integration over the time is trivial and the time evolution matrix  ( [ u ] ) in the presence of time ordering can be obtained easily  @xcite . in the appendix part , the evolution matrices after each kick are presented and by using these propagators in figs .",
    "1(a ) and  1(b ) , the effects of the sequence of three kicks on @xmath65 for @xmath6 and @xmath66 initial states are displayed , respectively , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the concurrence for the considered initial states in the time domains @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 may be found by using eqs .",
    "( [ u^kpara ] ) ,  ( [ twokickpara ] ) and  ( [ tkpara ] ) , respectively , in eqs .",
    "( [ conn ] ) and  ( [ probability ] ) .",
    "both figures show the pronounced effect of the kick on entanglement dynamics ; the concurrence of these initial states starts oscillating just after a single kick with an increase in their oscillation amplitudes with the increase in the ratio @xmath73  ( see the time domain @xmath70 ) .",
    "in fact , a sudden kick applied at @xmath74 induces entanglement from the initially unentangled qubits  ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and yields oscillations in the concurrence function for the bell state  ( fig .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that for the magnetic fields acting in the @xmath3-axes , it was found that the qubits remain unentangled or maximally entangled state at all times for @xmath6 or @xmath66 initial states despite the existence of strong external kicks  @xcite .",
    "comparing one , two and three kick regions , the sole effect of the number of kicks is found to change the amplitude  ( or minimum ) of @xmath65 for initial bell state . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1(b ) , after second kick , the amplitude of concurrence oscillations increases compared to that of first kick , while it decreases after third kick . on the other hand , for @xmath6 state case , the effect of the number of kicks is complicated compared to the bell state case , because each kick can change the amplitude , maximum and minimum of @xmath65 .",
    "it is obvious that after each kick the minimum of @xmath65 increases for initially separable state .",
    "the most important observation from these figures is the possibility of obtaining almost steady high concurrence around 1 after third kick for @xmath69 and both initial states .",
    "this shows that for certain system parameters  ( here we set @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , it is possible to create highly entangled qubits from an initially separable state by perturbing the qubits via instantaneous pulses . also note that after second kick , the minimum of @xmath65 for bell state can go to 0 for @xmath68 .",
    "as mentioned above , the qubit - qubit interaction has no effect on the entanglement of the considered states before the kick , while their oscillation frequencies depend on the qubit - qubit interaction strength , @xmath17 , after the kick as can be seen from figs .",
    "1(a ) and  1(b ) as well as from the matrix elements in the appendix part .    to further elucidate the effect of the strength and the direction of the magnetic fields on @xmath65 , we have displayed the contour plot of @xmath65 versus @xmath79 and @xmath73 for the separable initial state in fig .",

    "twenty equidistant contours of concurrence between 0  ( black ) and 1  ( white ) are shown . from fig .",
    "2(b ) , it can be deduced that the entanglement dynamics for the initially separable state is independent of the direction of external fields as long as the field is transverse , which also can be seen from the relevant time evolution matrix elements in appendices where the concurrence is @xmath18-independent .",
    "2(a ) shows two pronounced results for @xmath73-dependence of the concurrence for @xmath6 state : i ) the separable state is found to remain almost separable despite the strong external kicks for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "ii ) the long lived high entanglement regions which are indicated in white straight stripes sections have long lifetimes only after the second and the third kicks . from the comparison of the one , two and three positive kick sections , it seems that each kick widens the long lived high entanglement @xmath73-area .",
    "this shows the necessity of using multiple kicks to create almost steady high entanglement .",
    "also note that each kick creates a different @xmath73 oscillatory structure for @xmath65 .",
    "contrary to the initially separable state case , the concurrence for the initial bell state strongly depends on the direction of the external magnetic fields if @xmath83 as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) ; for @xmath84 , the entanglement between two qubits is almost unperturbed by the external positive kicks .",
    "similar to @xmath6 state case , the concurrence for @xmath66 is found to be unaffected from three kicks for @xmath81 and @xmath85 that can be deduced from fig .",
    "this figure also shows that every kick region has a different @xmath73 periodic structure and long - lived high entanglement can be effectively obtained and controlled only after third positive kick for the initial bell state after perturbing the entanglement dynamics of qubits with external kicks , for example in the time domain @xmath86 for @xmath87 . from fig .",
    "3(b ) , one can see that it is possible to get a constant long - lived entanglement with desired magnitude after third kick by adjusting @xmath18 .",
    "for example , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the kicked approximation is based on the energy level of the qubit , @xmath96 , and the width of the pulse , @xmath97 , and is valid if @xmath98 .",
    "depending on the physical implementation of the qubit , it might be difficult to obtain an external field as a delta function kick . instead of kicks , gaussian pulses can be used . as is well known ,",
    "the kicked approximation is the limiting case of gaussian pulses  @xmath99 , thus gaussian pulses enable us to consider the effects of using finite - width pulses on entanglement dynamics . from this point , in this section , we present the results of numerical calculations of concurrence for two qubits whose states are strongly perturbed by series of three positive narrow gaussian pulses for the initially separable @xmath6 and maximally entangled @xmath100 states .",
    "the concurrence for the considered initial states may be calculated by solving numerically the set of first order coupled ordinary differential equations in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath101 with replacing @xmath102 and @xmath103 . here",
    "the gaussian pulses are assumed to have the same width @xmath97 and centered at times @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we will determine how the concurrences of the initially separable and bell states depend on the pulse width .",
    "it should be noted here that if @xmath97 were chosen small enough , the results obtained in the previous section could be reached .    in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(f ) , we have shown @xmath65 versus @xmath79 for a system strongly perturbed by three narrow gaussian pulses for @xmath6 and @xmath66 initial states with @xmath106 and @xmath68 or @xmath69 . comparing figs .",
    "1(a ) and  1(b ) with the subfigures in fig .  4 , the width of the pulse changes the minimum , maximum and the amplitude of @xmath65 for @xmath6 state , while for bell state , this effect is in its minimum  ( or amplitude ) .",
    "the most pronounced observation from these figures is the existence of constant high concurrence nearly 1 at times @xmath72 for @xmath69 and @xmath107 for both initial states as can be seen from the solid lines in figs .",
    "4(e ) and  4(f ) . from fig .",
    "4(e ) , it is safe to deduce that with a sufficiently high pulse width and @xmath73 ratio , it is possible to obtain a state very close to bell state from an initially separable state by using a gaussian pulse sequence .    to further elucidate the interplay between a pulse sequence , relative magnetic strength on qubits , pulse width and entanglement , we display the contour plot of @xmath65 as function of @xmath79 and @xmath73 at three different pulse widths @xmath108 in figs .",
    "5(a)-5(c ) . comparing the subfigures in fig .  5 with the ideal kick case  ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the most important effect of the increasing pulse width is found to be enlargement of the area of the long lived high entanglement regions which are the white straight areas toward the top of figs .",
    "5(a)-5(c ) .",
    "for the kick case , it was concluded that the long lived high entanglement regions only appear after second and third positive kicks , while for wider gaussian pulses , these regions also appear after the first pulse  ( for example , see the region @xmath70 in fig.5(c ) ) .",
    "contrary to fig .",
    "2(a ) , @xmath73 periodicity does not exist in figs .",
    "5(a)-5(c ) ; increasing the pulse width coalesces the @xmath73-dependent oscillatory structure and produce non - periodic structures .",

    "moreover , the transverse fast pulses enable one to manipulate , create and control entanglement for a number of initial states , while the manipulation of entanglement with the longitudinal fast pulses was found to be done only with a limited class of initial states  @xcite .    longitudinal and transverse control fields in the form of kick and gaussian pulse sequences can be used in a proper sequence to create , control and destroy entanglement from arbitrary initial pure states of two coupled qubits .",
    "the same formalism can be applied to initially mixed states by using the time evolution matrix elements provided in appendices to evolve the density matrix of the system as @xmath135 which might be interesting in analyzing the time evolution of more - general - than entanglement type quantum correlations in mixed states , such as quantum discord  @xcite .",

    "the time dependent magnetic fields on qubits @xmath15 and @xmath16 may be expressed as @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are called integrated magnetic strengths .",

    "( [ u ] ) becomes as  @xcite : @xmath139 with matrix elements @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "it should be noted that the propagator given by eq .",
    "( [ u^k ] ) is valid only at times @xmath143 .",
    "the next example is the positive - positive kick sequence applied at times @xmath57 and @xmath58 , namely , @xmath144 and @xmath145 . following the procedure given in eq .",
