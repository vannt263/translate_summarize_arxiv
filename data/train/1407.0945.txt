    "a topological insulator ( ti ) is an intriguing quantum state of matter which is insulating in its interior and possesses surface states ( sss ) crossing the bulk energy gap @xcite .",
    "the existence of the sss is provided by a @xmath3 topological invariant and the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "the @xmath3 invariant is a characteristic of the bulk band structure of a crystal and it comprises no information about the crystal surface .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence asserts that the odd numbers of pairs of gapless sss should arise @xcite at the interface between two crystals with different values of the @xmath3 invariant , for instance , between vacuum ( with the @xmath3 index equals zero ) and the ti ( with the @xmath3 index equals one ) , but it does not characterize the dispersion of the ss spectra .",
    "topological sss have been studied in a number of papers in tight - binding approximations @xcite and in envelope function approximation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless in any approach spectra of the sss should depend on details of crystal - vacuum interface structure . to take it into account one",
    "usually chooses appropriate boundary conditions ( bcs ) for a wave function of topological sss in a specific model .",
    "most of authors use open bcs ( wave function vanishes at the surface ) which guarantee massless dirac spectrum of sss in tis .",
    "however , open bcs are not highlighted by nature and the other bcs might be realized .",
    "there are few papers that address the problem of bcs for a wave function of sss at the surface .    within a 3d tight - binding model of ti",
    "@xcite it was shown that a strong topological insulator can not be transformed into a trivial insulator by means of varying bcs .",
    "but that tight - binding model is a toy model and does not describe any really existing 3d tis . therefore , it is important to study bc influence on sss in frames of more realistic * kp*-hamiltonian model though it is only valid in a vicinity of brillouin zone ( bz ) center .",
    "refs.@xcite analyzed dispersion dependence of sss on the bcs for envelope functions ( eigenfunctions of the * kp*-hamiltonian ) .",
    "in this approach one should exploit a matrix form of bcs with some unknown parameters @xcite that connect envelope functions and their derivatives on the interface .",
    "the boundary parameters are determined by the interface structure ( on the atomic scale ) as well as bulk band parameters of materials . as microscopic details of a real interface",
    "are unknown it is involved problem to calculate values of the boundary parameters .",
    "more reliable method to determine the parameters is to extract them from experiment ( for instance , in ref.@xcite it was done for the most studied gaas / algaas interface ) .",
    "aim of our paper is to demonstrate that the boundary parameters play crucial role not only for the spectrum of topological sss but also the very existence of sss in bulk gap near brillouin zone center , where envelope function approximation is valid .",
    "in addition , we show that this is in agreement with the bulk - boundary correspondence . to that end",
    "we consider a 2d tight - binding model of ti with general bcs at the edge .",
    "tuning the boundary parameters in the model we can modify spectra of sss over the full bz , for instance , so that they cross the bulk gap at the edge of the bz .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we derive general bcs for the envelope functions in hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells and in bi@xmath0se@xmath1-type 3d ti and analyze edge state ( es ) spectra in 2d ti and ss spectra in 3d ti .",
    "then we study an effect of general bcs within a tight - binding model of 2d ti that allows us to clarify behavior of the ss spectra over the full brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the phase of 2d ti was obtained in hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells with a certain thickness and composition @xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum in the quantum wells near the critical thickness is described by the effective 2d hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the 2d momentum , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the effective speed of light ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pauli matrices in the standard representation acting in spin and orbital subspaces , and @xmath11 is the symbol for the direct product .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 are responsible for the dispersion of the mass @xmath13 , leading to the modification of the dirac spectrum @xmath14 , and are expected to have significant importance for the appearance of the ti ( @xmath15 in ti phase ) , ref .",
    "to use the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) in a restricted area , it should be supplemented by the bcs at the edge of the system . to do this ,",
    "we use general physical requirements that significantly restrict the form of the bcs .",
    "first of all , since the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) is of the second order in the momenta , we assume that the bcs are a linear combination of the wave function and its first derivative @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the outer normal to the edge , and @xmath18 is an arbitrary @xmath19 matrix . for convenience",
    ", the matrix @xmath20 can be selected as follows : @xmath21 second , we use the hermiticity of the hamiltonian in a restricted area .",
    "therefore , we perform partial integration of @xmath22 for arbitrary wave functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and equating the surface term to zero , we find the restriction @xmath25 this indicates that eq .",
    "( [ hermitiang ] ) implies the absence of current normal to the edge .",
    "next , we take into consideration the time - reversal symmetry with respect to the operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the complex conjugate .",
    "applying commutation of the operator @xmath28 with @xmath18 and eq .",
    "( [ hermitiang ] ) we obtain the matrix @xmath18 of the most general form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are dimensionless real phenomenological boundary parameters , which depend both on the behavior of the crystal potential near the edge and the bulk hamiltonian parameters .",
    "their values should be determined by microscopic calculations or by experiments .",
    "the open bcs correspond to @xmath31 .",
    "bcs @xcite correspond to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the other parameters equal zero .    consider two important particular cases .",
    "the first case occurs when boundary potential does not mix the spin of electrons . since the upper ( lower ) two components of the wave function correspond to spin - up ( -down ) , this case results in @xmath34 .",
    "the second case is when the edge , assumed as @xmath35 , possesses spatial inversion , e.g. @xmath36 , which is described by the operator @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the coordinate inversion @xmath39 .",
    "the commutation of the operator @xmath40 with @xmath18 gives @xmath41 in ( [ 2d_bcmatrix ] ) with @xmath42 .    to analyze the es spectra , we solve the schroedinger equation @xmath43 on the half - plane @xmath44 with the bcs ( [ 2d_genbc ] ) and ( [ 2d_bcmatrix ] ) .",
    "the wave vector along the edge , @xmath45 , is a good quantum number .",
    "the bulk solutions are located in the energy region @xmath46 , while the es solutions are situated outside the region .",
    "the wave function of the ess contains two exponents , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the ess is shown in fig.[fig : ssspectr2dti ] .",
    "the spectrum of the ess corresponding to the open bcs is shown by solid curves . in this case , the ess have a strictly linear dispersion and their decay lengths in the bulk gap are estimated as @xmath49 nm ( which is comparable to the atomic spacing ) and @xmath50 nm with slight dependence on @xmath45 ( the bulk parameters was taken from ref . [ ] for @xmath51 ev ) . however",
    ", if the parameter @xmath52 significantly decreases the ess pushed out of the band gap , see the dashed curves . to better understand this extraordinary behavior of the ess",
    ", we may note that usually the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 , describing the quadratic in @xmath55 terms of the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) , are small enough we therefore consider a limit @xmath56 .",
    "the electron spectrum @xmath57 of semi - infinite hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum well .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to the continuous spectrum ( bulk solutions ) .",
    "the edge states are described by solid curves for open boundary conditions ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , and dashed curves for @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( all the other boundary parameters equal zero for both curves ) .",
    "thus , the edge states vanish from the gap of the ti for some values of the boundary parameters .",
    "nevertheless there are edge states in the bulk gap but they cross the bulk gap at large momenta that are beyond the scope of the envelope function approximation , see fig.[fig : ssspectrlattice2dti].,width=302 ]    at the limit , the bulk spectrum has exactly the 2d dirac form and it is instructive to compare our results with known es spectra for the 3d dirac equation @xcite with @xmath62 .",
    "we should point out that in this case , @xmath63 for open bcs , so that one of the es decay length is small by comparison to the atomic distance .",
    "the part of the wave function @xmath47 can not be described by the effective hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) , but it might be included in the bcs .",
    "we use the unitary transformation @xmath64 of the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) and reduce it to another form : @xmath65 this is merely one of the standard forms of the 3d dirac equation with @xmath66 .",
    "the time - reversal invariant bcs for the dirac hamiltonian derived from hermiticity have the following form @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a real dimensionless phenomenological parameter . comparing the transformed bcs ( [ 2d_genbc ] ) , and ( [ 2d_bcmatrix ] ) for the 2d ti when @xmath69 ( in this case the normal derivative vanishes ) with eq .",
    "( [ diracbc ] ) , we obtain @xmath70 the remaining uncertainty in the parameters @xmath71 for fixed @xmath72 does not influence the es spectra . the electronic spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) with the bcs on the half - plane @xmath44 is shown in fig.[fig : ssspectr2dtidirac ] .",
    "for small @xmath55 , one may neglect the quadratic terms in @xmath55 in the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) .",
    "therefore the es spectrum of the dirac equation @xcite @xmath73 is equivalent to that of the 2d ti . for large @xmath55 ,",
    "the quadratic term dominates , but the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) and the bcs have limited application in the area of @xmath55 .",
    "the key feature of the obtained es spectrum is that if @xmath74 then the ess are in the bulk gap near @xmath75 , while if @xmath76 there are no ess near @xmath75 .",
    "this means that massless ess ( dirac cone ) can be found in the gap of the ti phase ( @xmath15 ) if @xmath77 , as well as in the trivial phase ( @xmath78 ) if @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the former case the ess are not topologically protected .    to finally persuade the reader ,",
    "let us simplify a general dispersion equation that describe the es spectra of the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) on the half - plane with the bcs ( [ 2d_genbc ] ) , and ( [ 2d_bcmatrix ] ) , in a case where @xmath80 and @xmath53 is small .",
    "without loss of generality , we can consider the bcs which do not mix the spin of electrons ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) and possess spatial inversion @xmath81 ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) .",
    "then , in the first order in the parameter @xmath83 , one can obtain the spectra of ess again in the form ( [ diracssspectra ] ) , but with @xmath84    hence , once again , the es spectra depend significantly on boundary parameters and the inversion of mass is not a necessary or sufficient condition for the existence of the ess in the bulk gap at small momenta when the @xmath85-approximation is valid .    the electron spectrum of semi - infinite hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum well , where the boundary is described by the single parameter ( the bcs ( [ 2d_genbc]),([2d_bcmatrix ] ) , and ( [ 2dti - diracbc ] ) ) .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to the continuous spectrum .",
    "the edge states are described by solid curves for @xmath86 , dashed curves for @xmath87 and dash - dotted curves for @xmath88.,width=302 ]    thus , we have demonstrated that the open bcs for the hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) are not the only ones possible .",
    "the solutions of the effective hamiltonian ( [ 2dham ] ) with the open bcs have a limited range of applicability due to the inadequate profile of the wave function for small @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", it is more suitable and much easier to use the dirac equation with the bcs ( [ diracbc ] ) , which contain only one boundary parameter , @xmath72 .",
    "we stress that boundary parameters may remove ess from the gap at small momenta .",
    "further ( sec.[lattice_model ] ) we will show that in this case the sss will cross the bulk gap near edges of the bz in agreement with the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "here , we consider a simplified and isotropic * kp*-hamiltonian of 3d ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 near the center of the bz .",
    "this is the 3d dirac hamiltonian with the momentum depending mass term@xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the three - dimensional momentum vector , @xmath92 and @xmath53 are the model parameters .",

    "one can reduce the number of parameters in the bcs by applying symmetry considerations .",
    "below , we consider a surface with outer normal @xmath97 , and assume that the bcs ( [ bc_general ] ) possess symmetries of a semi - infinite bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystal with the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "they include the rotation @xmath98 of the coordinate system on the angle @xmath99 about the @xmath100 axis , time - reversal symmetry @xmath101 and reflection @xmath102 in @xmath103 plane . for the hamiltonian@xcite ( [ 3d_ham ] )",
    ", these operations of the symmetry are represented by @xmath95 matrices @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the invariance of the bcs upon the symmetry operation , e.g. , @xmath102 , means that relation ( [ bc_general ] ) with the same boundary condition matrix @xmath94 can be applied to the transformed bispinor @xmath107 where the boundary operator is denoted .",
    "applying the symmetry operations together with the requirement of the hermiticity of the hamiltonian ( [ 3d_ham ] ) in a half - space @xmath108 , leads to the following form for @xmath94 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are real phenomenological boundary parameters which implicitly characterize the microscopic surface structure .",

    "<S> nevertheless , we reveal in frames of the tight - binding model that when surface states do not exist in the bulk gap in the brillouin zone center they cross the gap in other points of the brillouin zone in agreement with the bulk - boundary correspondence . </S>"
