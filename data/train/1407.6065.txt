    "ever since first recorded by newcomb @xcite in 1881 and re - discovered by benford @xcite in 1938 , examples of data and systems conforming to ( [ eq1 ] ) in one form or another have been discussed extensively , for instance in real - life data ( e.g.@xcite ) , stochastic processes ( e.g.  @xcite ) and deterministic sequences ( e.g.  @xmath14 and the prime numbers @xcite ) .",
    "there now exists a large body of literature devoted to the mechanisms whereby mathematical objects , such as e.g.  sequences or random variables , do or do not satisfy ( [ eq1 ] ) or variants thereof . as of this writing , an online database @xcite devoted exclusively to bl lists more than 800 references .",
