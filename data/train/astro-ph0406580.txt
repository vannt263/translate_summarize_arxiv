    "the magellanic clouds are a pair of satellite galaxies which are gravitationally bound to our own but which have structural and chemical characteristics differing significantly from each other , and from the milky way .",
    "these differences are likely to be reflected in the properties of different stellar populations .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is located at a distance of about 60 kpc ( harries , hilditch , & howarth , 2003 ) and centred on a position of r.a .",
    "it is therefore close enough to be observed with modest ground based telescopes whilst at the same time providing an opportunity to study and compare the evolution of other galaxies .",
    "intensive x - ray satellite observations have revealed that the smc contains an unexpectedly large number of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) . at the time of writing ,",
    "46 known or probable sources of this type have been identified in the smc and they continue to be discovered at a rate of about 1 - 3 per year , although only a small fraction of these are active at any one time because of their transient nature .",
    "all x - ray binaries so far discovered in the smc are hmxbs ( coe 2000 ) .",
    "most high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) belong to the be class , in which a neutron star orbits an ob star surrounded by a circumstellar disk of variable size and density .",
    "the optical companion stars are early - type o - b class stars of luminosity class iii - v , typically of 10 to 20 solar masses that at some time have shown emission in the balmer series lines .",
    "the systems as a whole exhibit significant excess flux at long ( ir and radio ) wavelengths , referred to as the infrared excess .",
    "these characteristic signatures as well as strong h@xmath1 line emission are attributed to the presence of circumstellar material in a disk - like configuration ( coe 2000 , okazaki and negueruela 2001 ) .    the mechanisms which give rise to the disk are not well understood , although fast rotation is likely to be an important factor , and it is possible that non - radial pulsation and magnetic loops may also play a part .",
    "short - term periodic variability is observed in the earlier type be stars.the disk is thought to consist of relatively cool material , which interacts periodically with a compact object in an eccentric orbit , leading to regular x - ray outbursts .",
    "it is also possible that the be star undergoes a sudden ejection of matter ( negueruela 1998 , porter & rivinius , 2003 ) .",
    "be / x - ray binaries can present differing states of x - ray activity varying from persistent low or non - detectable luminosities to short outbursts .",
    "systems with wide orbits will tend to accrete from less dense regions of the disk and hence show relatively small outbursts .",
    "these are referred to as type i and usually coincide with the periastron of the neutron star .",
    "systems with smaller orbits are more likely to accrete from dense regions over a range of orbital phases and give rise to very high luminosity outbursts , although these may be modulated by the presence of a density wave in the disk .",
    "prolonged major outbursts , which do not exhibit signs of orbital modulation , are normally called type ii ( negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "a chandra survey of the smc bar region , initiated by zezas et al . , covered five separate fields between may and october 2002 ( zezas et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the positions covered by the acis - i arrays from these observations are shown in relation to known pulsars in figure  [ fig : smc ] .",
    "these have been overlaid on a neutral hydrogen density image of the smc ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the standard acis - i0123s23 ccd configuration was used although all sources discussed in this paper were found in the acis - i region which provides a @xmath2 field of view .",
    "exposure times were between 7.6 and 11.6  ksec .",
    "data were extracted from the acis level 2 event fits files which were taken with a frame readout time of 3.241 s. using the ciao v3 software , these observations were barycentrically corrected after which potential sources were detected using the _ wavdetect _ algorithm .",
    "background was subtracted using rectangular regions of varying sizes , after which timing analysis of the lightcurves was carried out using both lomb - scargle and fourier transform algorithms .",
    "the starlink period programme was used to generate pulse profiles folded on the resultant periods and these were then fitted with a sine function from which the pulsed fractions were determined .",
    "three of these observations ( 2946 , 2947 and 2948 ) yielded significant results in the detection and identification of x - ray pulsars .",
    "these are summarised in table  [ tab1 ] which also includes two previously known sources seen in the same data .",
    "the positional errors generated by _",
    "wavdetect _ have been combined in quadrature with the chandra nominal 90% confidence radial uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec to give the errors shown .",
    "spectral information for these sources was obtained using the ciao _ psextract _ tool .",
    "the spectra were initially binned to a minimum of 10 counts per bin using the ftools utility grppha before being analysed with xspec .",
    "it was found however , that in the case of the three weakest sources this resulted in a poor fit and these were therefore binned to 2 counts per bin .",
    "channel energy outside the limits of 0.3 kev and 10 kev was ignored .",
    "the spectra were then fitted to an absorbed powerlaw model , the results of which are summarised in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "@xmath3 for the weaker sources would not be statistically valid , because of the relatively low number of counts , and has been omitted .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .        [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      cxou j005736.2 - 721934 was originally discovered in chandra observation 1881 on 15 may 2001 ( macomb et al .",
    "2003 ) where it was reported to have a pulse period of 565.83s .",
    "it was weakly visible in observation 2948 where it was found to have a pulse period of @xmath4 with a confidence of 90% .",
    "the spectrum was obtained from data binned to 2 counts per bin .",
    "rx j0050.8 - 7316 has a well established pulse period of 323s ( coe et al , 2002 ) .",
    "this period was also weakly detectable in observation 2945 although at a lower power than several other peaks and would not have been regarded as significant if the source were not already known .",
    "the discovery of these pulsars brings the total number of x - ray binaries so far discovered in the smc to 46 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pn ] shown the number of known pulsars by date and illustrates how the steep upward trend shows no sign of levelling off .",
    "the research of naz ' e et al.(2003 ) points to the possibility that there may be hundreds more whereas a relative comparison based on the distribution of these systems in the milky way would lead one to expect a population of perhaps one or two .",
    "such a high density must provide clues about the star formation rates in the smc and evidence from which a more accurate picture of its formation and recent history can be developed .",
    "the broad range of local @xmath5 values seen in this relatively small sample may simply reflect differing local environments or alternatively may indicate a measure of the depth of the source in the smc .",
    "the latter may be an important effect since the work of laney & stobie ( 1986 ) has shown that the smc may have a depth of 20 kpc .",
    "further research in this area should help to formulate a more accurate three dimensional picture of the smc .",
    "the authors are grateful to the the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , which is operated for nasa by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory , for the use of the chandra observations .",
