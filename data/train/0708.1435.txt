    "generalizations to open quantum systems have only been discussed for restricted model systems or various constraints on the microscopic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one major problem is that the proofs of the so - called group of non - equilibrium fluctuation theorems as well as the work fluctuation theorems relate properties of trajectories from forward and backward processes with each other .",
    "trying to transfer these proofs to quantum systems brings up the problem of trajectories in the quantum case .",
    "another , possibly even more severe problem is the question of what exactly has to be understood by fluctuations in a quantum system . in quantum mechanics the state of a system",
    "is fully described by its density operator . without any measurement",
    "it is ambiguous to speak about fluctuations , because the probability of a measurement outcome of a certain quantity might vary , but not the untouched quantity itself .",
    "fluctuations of one - time quantities are not ambiguous as far as their measurement is concerned .",

    "every measurement changes the state of the system thereby influencing its evolution . in the case of work fluctuation theorems the measurement has naturally to be included since one needs to measure the amount of work performed on the system .",
    "this measurement will then yield different values for each repetition and is thus said to fluctuate .",
    "so , in this sense we have no problem speaking of fluctuations .",

    "there is no need to specify the underlying dynamics any further .",

    "we use this @xmath63 in order to compute the average @xmath58 . this result",

    "we get @xmath72 within our numerical accuracy , indicating that the jarzynski relation is valid .",

    "note that the distribution of work for the closed system is , indeed , though only slightly , different from the one obtained for the same boundary conditions under microcanonical coupling .    due to the interaction between system and environment the energy levels of the system",
    "are `` smeared out '' . despite the fact that the interaction is weak ,",
    "the system s energy levels are each splitted into many energy levels with slightly different energy eigenvalues according to the number of energy levels in the environment and their respective degeneracies .",
    "some of these energy levels are resolved within numerical accuracy leading to slightly distinct values of work @xmath3 .",
    "this might lead to the impression that we have multiple values of work probabilities @xmath63 for a given work @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : potwell_micro_closed ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : potwell_can_hot ] for the open system .",
    "this is not the case since for exactly - in the numerical sense - equal work values , the probabilities add up to a single probability @xmath63 .",

    "now , we focus on expansions of the quantum well , which is effectively cooled down by these dilations .",
    "this will cause energy to flow from the bath into the system trying to restore the initial temperature and we expect that transitions to higher energy levels will be facilitated .",
    "first , we have chosen a moderate initial temperature , such that only the first two energy levels are significantly occupied , resulting typically in a work distribution as depicted in fig .",

    "[ hight ] we suppose that the lower the temperature the bigger this deviation . indeed ,",
    "if we choose the initial temperature to be very low , such that almost only the ground state is occupied , we have @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , we expect the work distribution to be very narrow since transitions from the ground state into higher ones are relatively unlikely ( cf .",
    "[ fig : potwell_can_cold ] ) .",
    "next , we choose a very high initial temperature , such that almost every energy level has the same probability to be occupied , in order to check whether the jarzynski relation is valid as predicted .",

    "the key idea has been to split the exponent of the partition sum into parts for the system and environment , respectively .",
