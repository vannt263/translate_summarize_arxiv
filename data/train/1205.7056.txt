    "the main objective of this paper is the study of the algebraic structure of the integral chains on the mapping space of the @xmath2-sphere into an orientable @xmath3-dimensional manifold @xmath4 .",
    "our main tools are factorization algebras and factorization homology .",
    "we also demonstrate the efficiency of these tools to study _ iterated bar construction _ and _ iterated loop spaces _ and to describe the structure of the _ centralizer _ of @xmath7-algebra maps as well as a solution to the higher deligne conjectures .",
    "these applications are the core of sections [ s : centralizers ] , [ s : brane ] and [ s : barmain ] which deal with generalizations of the hochschild cohomology to @xmath7 and @xmath5-algebras and their algebraic structures , using the concept of factorization homology .",
    "the algebraic structure of the chains on the mapping spaces of spheres into a manifold has drawn considerable interest , following the work of chas - sullivan  @xcite on the free loop space .",
    "the homology of the free loop space @xmath10 , shifted by the dimension of @xmath4 , has the structure of a bv - algebra , and in particular of a gerstenhaber algebra , or a @xmath11-poisson algebra , that is of a ( graded ) commutative algebra endowed with a degree @xmath11 lie bracket satisfying the leibniz rule .",
    "this structure is now known to be part of a @xmath12-dimensional homological conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "the bv - algebra structure lies in the genus @xmath13 part of this topological conformal field theory . _",
    "higher string topology _ , also referred to as _",
    "brane topology _ , is a generalization of string topology in which the circle is replaced by the @xmath2-dimensional sphere .",
    "sullivan and voronov ( see  @xcite ) have stated that the ( shifted ) homology of the mapping sphere @xmath14 has the structure of a @xmath15-algebra and in particular of a @xmath2-poisson algebra ( or @xmath2-braid algebra in the terminology of  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter structure is the analogue of a gerstenhaber algebra in which the lie bracket is of degree @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath15-algebra is an algebra over the homology of the operad of framed @xmath2-dimensional little disks , _",
    "i.e. _ , the framed @xmath7-operad ; while an @xmath2-poisson algebra is an algebra over the homology of the @xmath7-operad , for instance see  @xcite .",
    "sullivan - voronov work leads to the following question : is it possible to lift the @xmath2-poisson algebra structure on the homology of @xmath14 to a structure of @xmath7-algebras on the chains of @xmath14 ? for an @xmath2-connected",
    "closed and oriented manifold @xmath4 , we give a positive answer to this conjecture :    let @xmath4 be a @xmath2-connected poincar duality space whose homology groups are projective @xmath16-modules .",
    "the shifted chain complex @xmath17 has a natural @xmath0-algebra structure which induces the sullivan - voronov sphere product in homology @xmath18 when @xmath4 is an oriented closed manifold .",
    "this @xmath0-algebra structure can be seen an higher dimensional analogue of the genus @xmath13 part of a topological conformal field theory .",
    "our approach is based on an _ algebraic model _ of the chains on the mapping spaces generalizing _ hochschild cochains _ whose use proved to be a fruitful model for string topology operations .",
    "hochschild cohomology groups of an algebra @xmath19 with value in a bimodule @xmath20 are defined as @xmath21 while the hochschild homology groups @xmath22 are defined similarly by derived tensor products .",
    "these ( co)homology groups are given by standard ( co)chain complexes , for instance see  @xcite .",
    "the hochschild cohomology of any associative ( or @xmath23 ) algebra has a natural gerstenhaber algebra structure and further , by the ( solutions to the ) deligne conjecture , the latter is induced by an @xmath24-algebra structure on the hochschild cochains .",
    "hochschild ( co)chains are a model for cochains on the free loop space and string topology . indeed , there is an isomorphism  @xcite @xmath25\\ ] ] if @xmath4 is an oriented and simply connected manifold of dimension @xmath26 which , in characteristic zero is an isomorphism of gerstenhaber algebras  @xcite .",
    "further , hochschild chains of calabi - yau ( @xmath23-)algebras carry a topological conformal field theories structure  @xcite .",
    "the above isomorphisms   make use of two ingredients .",
    "first , it uses the ( dual of ) an isomorphism @xmath27 for any simply connected space @xmath4 ( which can be described in geometric terms by chen interated integrals when @xmath4 is a manifold ) and , second , it uses a lift of the poincar duality quasi - isomorphism @xmath28 $ ] to a bimodule map , when @xmath4 is further a closed manifold . in this paper , we study and use the generalizations of these two facts for @xmath2-dimensional spheres as well as the @xmath24-algebra structure on hochschild cochains as we explain below .",
    "combining these three ingredients will give us the desired @xmath0-algebra structure on @xmath29 .",
    "our technique should be related to those of hu  @xcite and hu - kriz - voronov  @xcite .",
    "bimodules over an associative algebra correspond to the _ operadic _ notion of @xmath23-modules .",
    "there is a notion of @xmath7-hochschild cohomology where maps of @xmath19-bimodules are replaced by maps of @xmath19-@xmath7-modules for an @xmath7-algebra @xmath19 , see  @xcite .",
    "the kontsevich - soibelman generalization of deligne conjecture , _",
    "i.e. _ , the higher deligne conjecture , is that the @xmath7-hochschild cohomology of @xmath19 , denoted @xmath30 is an @xmath0-algebra . for @xmath31 a topological space , the cochains @xmath32 are more than simply an associative algebra but are _ homotopy commutative _ , that is , carries a functorial structure of @xmath5-algebra ; in particular of an @xmath7-algebra for all @xmath2 . in characteristic",
    "zero , one can use cdgas models for the cochains , but this is not possible when working over integers or a finite field .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath5-algebras , @xmath7-hochschild cohomology get extra functoriality ( not shared by all @xmath7-algebras ) and actually identifies with higher hochschild cohomology over spaces , a notion dual to higher hochschild homology .",
    "the latter theories are the subject of section  [ s : hhforeinftyalg ] and can be expressed in terms of _ factorization homology _ , also referred to as _ topological chiral homology _  @xcite",
    ". factorization homology is an invariant of _ both _ ( framed ) manifolds ( and framed embeddings ) and @xmath7-algebras based on ( extended ) topological field theories .",
    "in fact , the factorization homology of @xmath5-algebras becomes a homotopy invariant and can be applied to any space ( and continuous maps ) and not just to framed manifolds .",
    "this generalization is precisely computed by _ higher hochschild homology _ , introduced by pirashvili in  @xcite , which can be seen as a kind of _ limit _ of these ideas when the dimension of the tft goes to infinity  @xcite . indeed , by theorem  [ t : ch = tch ] below ( and  @xcite ) that if @xmath31 is a manifold and @xmath19 an @xmath5-algebra , then , the factorization homology @xmath33 of @xmath31 with coefficients in @xmath19 is naturally equivalent to the hochschild chains @xmath34 of @xmath19 over @xmath31 .",
    "the restriction to @xmath5-algebras is not an issue in our case of interest since the cochain complex @xmath32 is indeed an @xmath5-algebra .",

    "the functoriality with respect to spaces is a key feature which allows us to derive algebraic operations on the higher hochschild chain complexes from maps of topological spaces . in particular , for any pointed space @xmath31 , @xmath34 is naturally an @xmath37-module which allows to define _ higher hochschild cochains _ @xmath38 over any pointed space @xmath31 by dualizing the hochschild chains ( as @xmath19-modules ) , see section [ ss : cohheinfty ] .",
    "the relationship with @xmath7-hochschild cohomology is given by the fact that , for any @xmath5-algebra @xmath19 , the hochschild cochains over the @xmath2-dimensional sphere @xmath39 of @xmath19 with value in itself coincides with its @xmath7-hochschild cohomology .",
    "let @xmath8 be a map of @xmath5-algebra and let @xmath40 be endowed with the induced @xmath19-@xmath5-module structure .",
    "then there is a natural equivalence of @xmath7-algebras : @xmath41    higher hochschild chains have a good axiomatic characterization ( similar to eilenberg - steenrod axioms ) which formally follows from the fact that @xmath5-algebras are tensored over spaces , see corollary [ c : properties ] in section [ ss : axiomhh ] .",
    "the aforementioned relationship between free loop spaces and hochschild chains generalize to every space taking advantage of its functoriality with respect to maps of spaces .",

    "we first define , for any @xmath19-@xmath5-algebra @xmath44 the ( associative ) _ wedge product _ @xmath45 and then we prove that when @xmath31 is a sphere @xmath46 , the wedge product induces a structure of _",

    "s : centralizers ] we reinterpret and generalize the above results , to the @xmath7-algebras case , in terms of _ centralizers_. in fact , using factorization algebras , for any map @xmath8 of @xmath7-algebras , we put a natural @xmath7-algebra structure on the @xmath7-hochschild cohomology @xmath51 , see theorem  [ t : enalghoch ] .",
    "we then show that this structure is precisely the centralizer @xmath52 of @xmath53 in the sense of lurie  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be an @xmath7-algebra map and endow @xmath51 with the @xmath7-algebra structure given by theorem  [ t : enalghoch ] .",
    "then the @xmath54-hochschild cohomology @xmath55 is the centralizer @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , it is the solution to a universal problem . as a consequence , using an approach due to lurie  @xcite , this yields a _ solution _ to the higher deligne conjecture . indeed",
    "the naturality of the centralizer with respect to maps of @xmath7-algebras implies that in the case of @xmath56 , @xmath30 becomes an @xmath23-algebra object inside the @xmath57-category @xmath7-algebra , thus an @xmath0-algebra .",
    "our approach uses the relationship between @xmath7-algebras and factorization algebras which we recall , among other preliminaries , in section  [ s : operad ] .",

    "one recovers that @xmath5-@xmath19-modules are the same as left modules over @xmath19 as was proved in  @xcite .",

    "there is an equivalence of symmetric monoidal @xmath57-categories between the category @xmath68 of @xmath5 @xmath19-modules and the category of left @xmath19-modules ( where @xmath19 is viewed as an @xmath23-algebra ) .",
    "we give a proof of this result using factorization homology in section [ ss : lifttoeinfty ] . from this , we deduce in section [ ss : e - inf - pd ] , that , for a closed oriented manifold @xmath4 , the poincar duality isomorphism can be _ uniquely lifted _ into an @xmath5-quasi - isomorphism @xmath69 $ ] .",

    "putting together the above results on deligne conjecture , poincar duality and interpretation of higher hochschild chains in terms of mapping spaces , we obtain in section [ s : brane ] that the chains @xmath29 for an @xmath2-connected manifold @xmath4 inherits an natural @xmath0-algebra structure ( theorem  [ t : branechain ] ) which lifts sullivan - voronov sphere product in homology . to actually recover the sphere product we use our _ explicit _ description of the centralizers of @xmath7-algebra maps .",
    "the above results thus yields chain level constructions over any field of coefficient as well as ( under the assumptions that @xmath4 has projective homology groups ) over integral coefficient .",

    "furthermore , as another application of theorems  [ t : edhoch ] and  [ t : enalghoch ] , in section [ s : bar ] , we apply for an augmented @xmath5-algebra @xmath19 the @xmath7-algebra structure on higher hochschild chains @xmath75 ( identified with the centralizer construction for the augmentation @xmath76 ) to describe the _ iterated bar construction _ of an augmented @xmath5-algebra . indeed ,",

    "<S> we obtain an @xmath0-algebra model on @xmath1 , the shifted integral chains on the mapping space of the @xmath2-sphere into an @xmath3-dimensional orientable closed manifold @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our main tool is factorization homology and higher hochschild ( co)chains and we discuss some other applications of these tools of independent interest . </S>",
    "<S> we construct and use @xmath5-poincar duality to identify the higher hochschild cochains , modeled over the @xmath2-sphere , with the chains on the above mapping space , and then relate the hochschild cochains to the deformation complex of the @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 , thought of as an @xmath7-algebra . </S>",
    "<S> we then invoke ( and prove ) the higher deligne conjecture to furnish the cotangent complex , and all that is naturally equivalent to it , with an @xmath0-algebra structure and further prove that this construction recovers the sphere product . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our approach to deligne conjecture is based on an explicit description of the @xmath7-centralizers of a map of @xmath5-algebras @xmath8 by relating it to the algebraic structure on hochschild cochains modeled over spheres , which is of independent interest . </S>",
    "<S> the latter also applies to iterated bar construction for @xmath5-algebras together with their @xmath7-coalgebra and @xmath5-algebra structure . in particular , we give a higher hochschild chain model of the natural @xmath7-algebra structure of the chains of the iterated loop space @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for general @xmath7-algebras , we apply factorization algebras to give a construction of the centralizers of any map of @xmath7-algebras , solutions of higher deligne conjecture and to discuss several features of the iterated bar construction for @xmath7-algebras . </S>"
