    "rr lyrae stars are the cornerstone of population ii distance indicators and countless theoretical and observational investigations have been devoted to the intrinsic accuracy of rr lyrae distance determinations ( caputo et al .",
    "2000 ; layden 2002 ; cacciari & clementini 2003 ; walker 2003 ) .",
    "however , we are still facing the problem that distance measurements based on different methods present discrepancies larger than the estimated total error budget ( see e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2000 ; bono 2003 )",
    ". this might be suggestive of still poorly constrained systematic errors .",
    "current predictions concerning the luminosity of horizontal branch ( hb ) models inside the rr lyrae instability strip bracket approximately 0.1 dex in luminosity .",
    "the difference is due to the adopted input physics which is not well - established yet ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ; pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .    notwithstanding this ,",
    "one of the most widespread methods to estimate rr lyrae distances to ggcs and local group galaxies is the correlation between the visual magnitude and the metal abundance ( @xmath1 $ ] ) .",
    "this method is in principle very robust , but presents several potential drawbacks : _",
    "i ) _ a ( strong ) dependence on evolutionary effects ( demarque et al .",
    "2000 ; castellani 2003 ) ; _ ii ) _ a possible nonlinear dependence on the metallicity ( castellani , chieffi , & pulone 1991 ; caputo et al . 2000 ) ; _ iii ) _ a non - trivial dependence on the reddening correction and on uncertainties affecting abundance measurements ( dallora et al .",
    "2004 ) . on the other hand , empirical evidence dating back to the 1990s",
    "indicates that @xmath2band nir observations of rr lyrae stars appear marginally affected by deceptive errors . in particular , @xmath2band data of rr lyrae stars , when compared with optical @xmath3band data , present : _",
    "i ) _ a smaller dependence on reddening uncertainties ; _ ii ) _ a smaller dependence on metal abundance ; _ iii ) _ a luminosity amplitude which is approximately a factor of 4 smaller than in the @xmath4band .",
    "this means that with a limited number of phase points , the time - averaged @xmath5 magnitude can be estimated with very good accuracy , since the light curve in this band is almost sinusoidal .",
    "moreover , and even more importantly , longmore et al . ( 1986 , 1990 ) demonstrated , on the basis of k - band photometry for a good sample of ggcs , that cluster rr lyrae do obey to a well - defined @xmath5-band pl relation ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this finding has been soundly confirmed by butler ( 2003 ) and by storm ( 2004 ) for rr lyrae in m3 and in ic4499 .",
    "the physical basis of the @xmath6 relation has been widely discussed by bono et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2003 ) .",
    "more recently , theoretical investigations ( bono 2003 ; catelan , pritzl , & smith 2004 ) have also emphasized the existence of well - defined pl relations in @xmath7 bands .",
    "however , observations lag theoretical predictions , and indeed we still lack accurate mean @xmath5-band magnitudes of cluster rr lyrae , since the current sampling of the light curves is rather poor , typically of the order of 4 - 6 phase points ( longmore et al . 1990 ) . moreover , @xmath7 measurements are only available for a limited sample of field rr lyrae stars ( fernley et al . 1987 ; carney et al .",
    "1995 ) . in order to fill this observational gap and to validate current predictions concerning the @xmath8-band @xmath0 relations ,",
    "we have undertaken a long - term project aimed at improving the current database of nir observations of cluster rr lyrae stars ( dallora et al .",
    "we selected a dozen of northern and southern ggcs which cover a wide metallicity range and host a sizable sample of rr lyrae stars .    in this investigation",
    ", we present the results for the gc m92 , one of the most metal - poor and oldest clusters in our sample .",
    "this cluster has often been a fundamental target to investigate the absolute age of ggcs and the chronology of the galaxy ( grundahl et al .",

    "3 we present optical and nir cmds , together with a detailed discussion concerning the key evolutionary features . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss nir light curves for the sample of rr lyrae stars in m92 and compare empirical and theoretical nir pl relations , while  5 deals with the new cluster distance determinations based on the nir @xmath9 relations and the comparison with similar estimates based on various distance indicators . a brief summary and",
    "the conclusions are outlined in the final section .",
    "the ggc m92 ( ngc 6341 ) is very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 , zinn 1985 ) and is located at a distance from the galactic center of @xmath11=9.1 kpc , and @xmath12=4.3 kpc above the galactic plane ( harris 1996 ) . therefore , it is a very good target to investigate its stellar content .",
    "the most recent wide - field ccd photometry was obtained in v and i bands with the cfh12k mosaic camera available at the @xmath13 canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) by lee et al .",

    "the cmd extends from the bright region down to @xmath14 mag fainter than the main sequence turn - off .",

    ". a sizable sample of 60 bright rg stars , including also three candidate variables detected by walker ( 1955 ) , were checked for variability by welty ( 1985 ) , but none was confirmed variable . during the last few years , the sample of rr lyrae stars has been investigated more in the optical than in the nir bands ( carney et al . 1992 ; cohen 1992 ; cohen & matthews 1992 ; storm , carney & latham 1992 , hereinafter scl ; storm et al . 1992 ; kopacki 2001 ; piersimoni et al .",

    "we adopt the metal - abundance ( @xmath16=-2.25 $ ] ) and the @xmath17-element enhancement ( @xmath18=0.30 $ ] ) given by salaris & cassisi ( 1996 , see also sneden , pilachowski , & kraft 2000 ) . by adopting these values and the global metallicity ( @xmath19 $ ] ) relation provided by salaris , chieffi , & straniero ( 1993 ) , we obtain for m92 a global metallicity @xmath19=-2.04 $ ] .      the nir data for m92 have been collected using the azt24 @xmath20 telescope of the campo imperatore ( laquila , italy ) observatory , located at an altitude of @xmath21 near the gran sasso ditalia mountain ( di paola 2003 ) . the azt-24 is equipped with the nir camera swircam ( brocato & dolci 2003 ) , which is based on a 256 x 256 hgcdte `` picnic '' array , sensitive in the wavelength range @xmath22 , provided by rockwell science corp . the camera is provided with the standard wide - band filters @xmath23 plus additional narrow - band filters and grisms .",

    "the photometric measurements of m92 were performed in the standard jhk bandpasses .",
    "we observed two different fields partially overlapped by 1x1 @xmath29 to adopt the same absolute calibration .",
    "the fields were chosen to observe the largest number of rr lyrae stars ( 11/17 ) .",
    "the observations for m92 were carried out during 12 nights between june and september 2002 .",
    "the typical exposure times range from @xmath30 to @xmath31 for the @xmath32-band , from @xmath30 to @xmath33 for the @xmath34-band , and from @xmath30 to @xmath35 for the @xmath5-band .",
    "the individual exposures were split in a number of sub - exposures ranging from 5 to 15 . for each sub - exposure , we dithered the images by 10 pixels both in x and in y direction .",
    "target and sky frames were alternatively collected , at a distance of 9 arcmin from each other .",
    "all the images were pre - processed using a pipeline called preprocess , developed by one of us ( a. di paola ) .",
    "median sky frames were subtracted from each target image before flat - fielding and co - adding the dithered images .",
    "photometry was performed using daophot / allstar ( stetson 1987 ) . in order to improve the photometric accuracy along the light curves we performed several tests using different techniques to stack the images , different criteria to select psf stars across the individual frames , as well as different reduction strategies to perform the photometry over the entire data set .",
    "we found that the best intrinsic accuracy can be achieved by stacking at least 4 consecutive images , due to the low s / n ratio of single images .",
    "we selected a reasonable number ( @xmath36 ) of uniformly spaced psf stars , together with a constant psf across each frame . to improve the accuracy of individual measurements and the limiting magnitudes",
    ", we used a few optical @xmath37-band images to derive a more complete star catalog ( @xmath38 20000 stars ) .",
    "these images were kindly provided by f. grundahl ( 2004 , private communication ) , and have been collected at the nordic optical telescope in la palma .",
    "finally , we reduced nir ( @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath5 ) and optical @xmath37-band frames simultaneously with daophot / allframe ( stetson 1994 ; dallora et al .",
    "2004 ) .    the standard field of p138-c measured by persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was observed 10 times at about the same air mass ( @xmath39 ) of the observations on m92 . in the calibrating equations",
    ", we neglected the extinction with the air mass , because the extinction coefficients measured at campo imperatore are @xmath40 for all the @xmath41-bands .",
    "we compared the calibrating equations derived for several nights with standard star observations and the accuracy of the nir calibrations is of the order of 0.03 mag .",
    "current calibrations were also compared with the pioneering work by cohen , frogel , & persson ( 1978 ) for m92 .",
    "four stars are in common with their photometric catalogue and the average difference in magnitude is : @xmath42 mag , @xmath43 mag , and @xmath44 mag ( our magnitudes are brighter ) .",
    "therefore , the two data sets are , within the errors , fully consistent with no systematic offset .",
    "the comparison between current nir photometry and @xmath15 data collected by vfpo shows that the two data sets agree quite well , and indeed on a star - by - star basis the difference in magnitude is : @xmath45 and @xmath46 mag ( with our magnitudes brighter ) .",
    "the large spread is due to the fact that our images and vfpo images overlap in a small @xmath47 region located close to the cluster center , and we have roughly a dozen of common stars .",
    "the nir cmds and the nir luminosity functions ( lfs ) are powerful diagnostics to investigate rg stars in gcs , since they allow us to constrain the accuracy and reliability of evolutionary predictions concerning low - mass stellar structures ( ferraro et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "note also that rg stars are the brightest cluster objects in nir bands , and therefore the unresolved background population marginally affects their photometry .",
    "this means that high signal - to - noise nir measurements of rg stars can be obtained close to the cluster center , i.e. the regions more affected by severe crowding in optical bands .",
    "moreover , since the nir survey of @xmath48 ggcs by frogel , cohen , & persson ( 1983 ) , based on a single - channel detector and aperture photometry , it became clear that @xmath49 colors of rg stars are excellent effective temperature indicators . in spite of these indisputable advantages ,",
    "the number of ggcs for which accurate , and deep nir cmds are available , is rather limited .",

    "a glance at the cmds discloses the sizable sample ( @xmath52 ) of cluster stars which have been measured .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the @xmath34,(@xmath51 ) cmd current photometry approaches the turn - off ( to ) region and that the intrinsic photometric error is of the order of 0.02 - 0.03 mag at the magnitude typical of rr lyrae stars ( open and filled circles ) .    in order to combine visual and nir magnitudes",
    ", we adopted the v - band photometry for m92 provided by kopacki ( 2001 ) , because this is the most recent and complete optical investigation of variable stars in m92 .",
    "this choice offers the advantage of having homogeneous @xmath53 colors for both variable and static stars .",
    "figure  [ optir ] shows the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 cmds based on the v photometry , kindly provided by kopacki , and current nir data .",
    "note that the faint limit of the kopacki s optical photometry is @xmath38 18 mag , which is brighter than the turn - off point .",
    "however , current nir photometry in @xmath32 and @xmath34 bands attains fainter limiting magnitudes . to overcome this problem",
    ", we also cross - correlated the @xmath7 catalogues with the deeper v - band photometry for m92 provided by rosenberg et al .",
    "detailed checks on the stars in common in the two v - band catalogues ( @xmath57 stars ) show that they agree very well , and indeed the mean difference is of the order of @xmath58 mag .",
    "the main evolutionary features of the optical / nir cmds are the following :    * the rgb is well - populated and roughly covers the entire rgb extension .",
    "empirical data range from the rgb tip down to the sub - giant branch @xmath59 mag . *",
    "the sample of rgb stars appears large enough - when compared with the old analysis of frogel , cohen , & persson ( 1983 ) - to provide a reliable estimate of the rgb tip . * data plotted in fig .",
    "[ optir ] disclose a well - defined horizontal branch ( hb ) in the three cmds .",
    "moreover , hot hb stars brighter than @xmath60 mag display a well - defined slope when moving from hotter to cooler effective temperatures .",
    "this trend is expected and is caused by the strong increase in the @xmath5-band bolometric correction towards cooler effective temperatures ( see fig . 1 in bono 2003 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , this empirical evidence brings forward that @xmath5-band magnitudes of hot hb stars can also be adopted to estimate cluster distances ( cassisi et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "[ optir ] also shows a 12 gyr isochrone for z=0.0001 , and y=0.245 .",
    "the isochrone was plotted by using a cluster reddening of e(b - v)=0.02 mag and the true distance modulus obtained by using the @xmath61 relations ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "extinction parameters for both optical and nir bands have been estimated using the standard extinction model of cardelli et al .",
    "data plotted in this figure disclose that a cluster age of @xmath62 gyr nicely accounts for stars located around the to region .",
    "this age estimate is , within the errors , in good agreement with age determinations provided by salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) , grundahl et al .",

    "the rgb luminosity function ( lf ) is a very robust observable in order to check the accuracy of the inner structure of rgb evolutionary models . in particular",
    ", the rgb lf can supply tight constraints upon the chemical stratification inside these stars ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) .",
    "the hydrogen stratification encountered by the thin h - burning shell affects the evolutionary rate , and in turn , the star counts along the rgb .",
    "in particular , the rgb bump marks the evolutionary phase during which the h - burning shell crosses the chemical discontinuity left over by the convective envelope soon after the first dredge - up .",
    "dating back to its first detection in 47 tuc ( lee 1977 ) , several theoretical and observational investigations have been focussed on the rgb bump ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999 ; zoccali et al . 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "owing to the anti - correlation of the rgb bump luminosity with the stellar metallicity , the detection of this feature is much easier in metal - intermediate and in metal - rich ggcs .",
    "this is the reason why the rgb bump has only been detected in a few metal - poor gcs . using both the differential and the cumulative k - band lf ( see fig .",
    "[ klf ] ) , we detected the rgb bump at @xmath63 mag .",
    "the rgb bump in m92 has also been provided by vfpo , who found a value @xmath64 mag .",
    "this estimate is @xmath65 mag fainter than current determination . the difference is larger than the estimated intrinsic photometric errors and the measured systematic offset between the two data sets .",
    "the difference might be due to the different size of rgb star samples . a glance at the data plotted in fig .",
    "1 of vfpo suggests that their rgb is not very well populated , and thus their estimate of the error affecting the rgb bump luminosity could have been underestimated . to further constrain the plausibility of the current @xmath5-band rgb bump detection , we performed a detailed comparison with updated evolutionary predictions ( see fig .",
    "[ bumpteo ] ) provided by pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in order to estimate the absolute k magnitude of the rgb bump in m92",

    ", we also included the rgb bump estimates provided by ferraro et .",
    "( 2000 ) and by vfpo .",
    "data plotted in fig .  [ bumpteo ] indicate that a fairly good agreement does exist between updated theoretical models ( solid lines ) and observations ( see also cassisi & salaris 1997 , vfpo , and references therein ) .",
    "however , current @xmath67 measurement of m92 appears at variance with the empirical trend ( dashed line ) found by valenti et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "finally , we note that the observed @xmath68 is located at @xmath69 .",
    "this means @xmath70=14.17 mag and , by adopting the same true distance modulus , @xmath71 mag , a value which agrees with theoretical predictions .",
    "stellar isochrones provided by pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) predict , for an age of 12 gyr , @xmath72 mag .",
    "the current sample of rgb stars appears , in the brighter portion of the rgb , large enough to estimate the brightness of the rgb tip .",
    "if we assume that the brightest and coolest rgb star is at the rgb tip , one derives that @xmath73 mag . by using the nir calibration of the rgb tip provided by bellazzini et al .",

    "note that if we adopt the true distance modulus based on the rr lyrae @xmath66 relations , we find that the absolute @xmath5 magnitude of the rgb tip is @xmath76 mag .",
    "therefore , the two independent estimates are , within the errors , identical .",
    "current nir observations allowed us to derive accurate light curves for 11 out the 17 rr lyrae stars and for the bl her .",
    "the light curves in the @xmath8 bands for first overtone variables are shown in figure  [ rrc_curve ] , while the light curves for the sample of fundamental rr lyrae stars and the bl her ( v7 ) are displayed in figure  [ rrab_curve1 ] .",
    "individual @xmath8 measurements are listed in table  [ tabrrdata ] : for each star we give the identification number , the heliocentric julian day ( hjd ) of the observations , and the corresponding @xmath8 magnitudes together with intrinsic photometric errors .",
    "we have determined the mean @xmath32 and @xmath34 magnitudes of rr lyrae by fitting the individual phase points measured by allframe with a cubic spline .",
    "the typical errors on the mean magnitudes are of the order of @xmath77 mag . on the other hand ,",
    "the fit of the individual @xmath2band phase points was performed using a template curve .",
    "this approach further improves the intrinsic accuracy of mean @xmath5 magnitudes , because : _",
    "i ) _ it avoids the spurious fluctuations introduced by the binning of individual phase points ; _ ii ) _ it allows a better propagation of individual photometric errors upon the mean magnitude .",
    "this method was originally developed by jones , carney & fulbright ( 1996 ) , and provides the mean @xmath5-band magnitude of rr lyrae stars by fitting an empirical template light curve to a few phase points .",
    "they provided five different templates according to the pulsation mode ( fundamental , @xmath78 ; first overtone @xmath79 ) and to the @xmath80-amplitude of the variable .",
    "following this approach and by using the @xmath81-amplitudes provided by kopacki ( 2001 ) , we computed the mean @xmath5 magnitude for each star by using the template curve .",
    "note that current mean @xmath8 magnitudes have been estimated as intensity averages and then transformed into magnitudes ( bono , caputo , & stellingwerf 1995 ) . moreover ,",

    "a few variables in our sample require individual comments .",
    "the variable v4 has a crowded neighborhood , and indeed the optical @xmath37-band images show a neighbor star located at a distance @xmath85 from the variable , i.e. a distance similar to the nir image resolution .",
    "therefore , its pulsational properties are unreliable , and in the following analysis we excluded this variable from our sample .",
    "the variable v7 was classified by kopacki ( 2001 ) , at variance with the sawyer - hogg catalogue ( 1973 ) , as a bl her instead of a fundamental rr lyrae .",

    "on the basis of an accurate optical photometry , carney et al .",
    "( 1992 ) noted that a static star , in particular a standard star ( listed by sandage & walker 1966 ) , was located inside the instability strip of m92 .",

    "data plotted in this figure show the expected ranking of the @xmath49 colors with the pulsation period , and indeed first overtone and fundamental pulsators do not overlap .",

    "( 2004 , see equations 2a,2b,2c ; dashed lines ) .",
    "data plotted in this figure disclose that predicted and observed slopes agree quite well in the three nir photometric bands , thus supporting the plausibility and the accuracy of current pulsation and evolutionary models .",
    "current findings together with similar results for cluster and field rr lyrae stars ( butler 2003 ; bono et al .",
    "2003 ; borissova et al . 2004 ; dallora et al . 2004 ) support the evidence that nir @xmath9 relations can supply accurate distance estimates ( bono et al .",
    "2001 ) . therefore , by using the new @xmath32-band @xmath9 relation ( eq .",

    "the final error budget was evaluated by accounting for the dispersion around the mean of the individual estimates , for the absolute photometric calibration ( @xmath119 ) , and for the uncertainty affecting the zero - point of the predicted @xmath9 relation ( @xmath120 ) . by adding in quadrature these error sources",
    ", we obtain a `` global '' uncertainty of 0.05 mag for the @xmath5-band , 0.06 , and 0.07 mag for the @xmath32 and @xmath34 band , respectively . by accounting for reddening corrections in the three different bands ,",

    "table  [ tabmod ] also gives the true distance moduli , based on the nir @xmath9 relations predicted by catelan et al .",
    "it is worth noting that the two sets of independent distance determinations are , within the uncertainties , identical .    during the last few years , the discussion concerning pros and cons of different methods to estimate the distances to ggcs has been addressed in several theoretical and empirical investigations ( reid 1997 ; pont et al .",
    "1998 ; carretta et al .",

    "( 2000 ) using the subdwarf main sequence fitting found true distance moduli for m92 which agree quite well with each other , @xmath122 mag and @xmath123 mag , respectively . to further constrain the accuracy of distance determinations to m92",
    ", we also adopted the first overtone blue edge ( fobe ) method suggested by caputo et al .",
    "this method relies on the comparison in the period-@xmath81-band magnitude plane between predicted and empirical @xmath81-band first overtone blue edge . by using this method and the visual magnitudes provided by kopacki ( 2001 ) for the three @xmath124 variables in m92",
    ", we derived a true distance modulus equal to @xmath125 mag . to provide a comprehensive scenario concerning distance determinations to m92",
    ", we also used the predicted hb luminosity provided by pietrinferni et al .",
    "theoretical hb models predict the luminosity of the zero age horizontal branch at the level of the rr lyrae instability strip , i.e. @xmath126",
    ". however , hb stars in nir bands do show a well - defined slope . in order to overcome this problem , we used predicted and empirical @xmath49 colors to estimate individual effective temperatures .",
    "we selected two variables , v10 and v11 , for which we found @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "the mean k magnitude of these two variables is : @xmath129 mag .",
    "the predicted absolute @xmath5-band magnitude of the zahb at the metallicity of m92 is equal to : @xmath130 mag .",
    "therefore , the true distance modulus is equal to @xmath131 mag .",
    "note that the comparison between the @xmath2band mean magnitude of rr lyrae stars and predicted @xmath2band zahb brightness at @xmath132 appears as a very promising approach , since in this band the evolutionary effects also imply a change in effective temperature ( bono et al .",
    "the seventh column of table  [ tabmod ] gives the distance to m92 estimated using the near - infrared baade - wesselink ( bw ) method for two cluster rr lyrae stars observed by cohen ( 1992 ) and by storm et al .",
    "the last column in table  [ tabmod ] lists the distance modulus to m92 using the empirical calibration of the luminosity of the rgb tip recently provided by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and shortly discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect1 ]    interestingly enough , data listed in table 5 disclose that distance determinations based on different methods and photometric bands agree quite well , within current empirical and theoretical uncertainty .",
    "this outcome applies to distance estimates based on both empirical and theoretical calibrations of different distance indicators . in particular",
    ", the agreement is better than 5% in distance estimates based on pulsational and evolutionary methods ( predicted nir @xmath9 relations , fobe , zahb ) and on the ms fitting .",
    "an uncertainty of the order of 10% for the tip of the rgb is expected due to the limited number of stars across this evolutionary phase in metal - poor clusters .",
    "distances based on the bw method present larger uncertainties . the difference might be due to the fact that bw distances are only based on two cluster variables .",
    "we collected new multiband nir ( @xmath8 ) time series data of the ggc m92 .",
    "the main results of this investigation can be summarized as follows :    * we performed an extensive and accurate nir photometric investigation of rr lyrae stars in the ggc m92 .",
    "for the first time , we provided well - sampled @xmath8-band light curves for eleven cluster rr lyrae variables . *",
    "we provided accurate estimates of nir pulsation properties ( mean magnitudes , luminosity amplitudes ) .",
    "the comparison between current data and updated theoretical prescriptions discloses a very good agreement concerning the slope of the @xmath8-band @xmath9 relations . * by adopting mean @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath5 magnitudes for our sample of rr lyrae stars and by relying on theoretical @xmath9 relations derived in this work for the @xmath32 and @xmath34-bands and predicted by cassisi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the @xmath5 band , we estimated the distance to m92 with an accuracy better than 5% .",
    "the same outcome applies if we use the nir @xmath9 relations provided by catelan et al .",
    "our distance estimates are also in very good agreement with recent accurate and independent measurements based on various distance indicators .",
    "this finding further strengthens the use of predicted nir @xmath9 relations for estimating distances to ggcs and local group galaxies .",
    "the current investigation clearly indicates the key - role of new and accurate nir photometry of rr lyrae stars in ggcs in constraining their pulsational and evolutionary properties and to assess the reliability and accuracy of nir @xmath9 relations as distance indicators for field and cluster rr lyrae stars .",
    "needless to say , it is quite important to extend such photometric analysis to other ggcs , in order to investigate the dependence on the metal content , on the evolutionary status , and on hb morphology ( cassisi et al .",
