    "are known to high accuracy .",
    "another direct result from these observations is the determination of the uv slope of the seds , generally characterized by the parameter @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this slope has been shown to become steeper ( bluer colors ) both with decreasing luminosity and with increasing redshift ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) . for a mid - aged ( @xmath20myr ) stellar population ,",
    "this slope generally depends most strongly on the dust reddening so this has been interpreted as an increase in the dust content of galaxies with cosmic time and as galaxies increase in luminosity @xcite .",
    "since the rest - frame uv light primarily probes young short - lived stellar populations ( mostly o and b stars ) , it is interesting to extend these observations to longer wavelengths and study the relative importance of more evolved stellar populations .",
    "this is very challenging though and is now only possible thanks to the incredible sensitivity of the irac camera on the @xmath0 space telescope .",
    "some of the first observations of rest - frame optical light from @xmath17 galaxies showed quite substantial uv - to - optical colors @xcite . under the usual assumption of smooth , exponentially declining star formation histories ( sfhs ) , these colors were interpreted as indicative of an evolved stellar population ( ages @xmath21 myr ) in combination with the younger populations probed by the uv - light .",

    "for example , for young star - froming galaxies , one might expect strong line emission . at the right redshift",
    ", these lines could contaminate the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath26 irac fluxes , resulting in red uv - to - optical colors similar to those produced by the balmer break @xcite . for emission lines to be strong enough to dominate the rest - frame optical fluxes , extremely young ages ( @xmath27myr )",

    "such models have ages shorter than the dynamical times of these high@xmath28 sources and are also somewhat uncertain",
    ". it would be surprising if the majority of these galaxies , which are selected over a redshift range that spans @xmath29myr , had such young ages .",
    "even if rest - frame optical emission nebular emission lines do not dominate the measured irac fluxes , it is expected that they will contribute some of the flux measured in the mid - ir , but the exact contribution currently remains hard to establish at these high redshifts .",

    "we start by registering the irac images to the higher resolution hst image that will be used as a light profile template . in this case",

    "we use the sextractor software @xcite to create segmentation maps .",
    "we isolate all the sources in a small area around each galaxy in our sample using these segmentation maps .",
    "we then convolve them with a kernel derived from the psfs of the hst and the irac images .",
    "we fit for the normalization fluxes of all sources ( including the source we are trying to clean ) simultaneously .",
    "finally we remove the flux from the unrelated sources to obtain a clean image of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "later we use these cleaned images to produce median stacks .",
    "the procedure described above does not always produce acceptable results .",
    "the reasons why it can fail vary but the most common is the presence of a source that is too bright , extended , and close to our region of interest . in these cases",
    "the amount of flux subtracted off our source of interest is large and more uncertain and in most cases results in large residuals .",
    "we have carefully inspected the residual images ( all sources subtracted , including the one in our sample ) and the cleaned images ( only unrelated neighbors subtracted ) of each of the sources in the original sample and come up with a sub - sample of sources with clean irac photometry .",
    "this `` by eye '' inspection criterion generally results in good agreement with a criterion that selects only the images with the lowest @xmath61 residuals but allows us to also remove sources that , even though have moderate @xmath61 values , present mild to strong residuals located very close to the source .",
    "overall , this reduces the sample to 60% of the original ( see table [ tbl : samplesummary ] ) .",
    "since the criterion adopted here depends on the complexity of the unrelated sources , it is not expected that it should introduce any biases that would be relevant in the determination of the mean rest - frame optical colors ( see figure [ fig : magdist ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that in star forming galaxies the total sfr appears to correlate with stellar mass , the so called main sequence of star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "this sequence has been observed at high - redshifts ( @xmath17 ) but contrary to what has been observed at @xmath62 , the normalization of the relation at fixed stellar mass does not seem to evolve over @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the lack of deeper rest - frame optical from @xmath0/irac for these sources is one of the big limitations to study this sequence to fainter magnitudes . in terms of the bulk of the population , however , progress can be made by stacking large numbers of sources to study their mean properties . in this section",
    "we seek to construct the median seds of galaxies at @xmath17 .    due to the nature of the dropout search and the filters available ,",
    "our full sample is naturally divided in redshift bins centered at @xmath64 plus the @xmath65 sample from @xcite . in this section ,",

    "these filters were chosen to be close to rest - frame 1500   at the different redshifts and make the splitting criterion fairly uniform across redshifts .",

    "imaging , the fluxes utilized correspond to the mag_auto values as determined using the sextractor code . for each uv - luminosity bin ,",
    "the median flux in each band was determined from the individual flux measurements of the sources in the bin that also have clean irac determinations .",
    "the uncertainty in the median was estimated through a bootstrap process . in each realization ,",
    "@xmath66 fluxes are drawn with replacement from the @xmath66 values available and perturbed by their individual uncertainties .",
    "generally the individual hst flux determinations have very high signal to noise .",
    "there are however , systematic uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the different bands and instruments across the sed .",
    "these uncertainties amount to at least 5% which we adopt as our minimum allowed uncertainty in any given band .    in the case of the irac imaging ,",
    "most sources are too faint to be individually detected even in these deep @xmath67hr integration images . instead of using individual fluxes , we first median combine ( pixel by pixel ) the cleaned stamps of the sources within a bin that have clean residuals from our irac cleaning procedure .",
    "we perform standard aperture photometry on the stacked images using a circular aperture of 2.5-diameter and correct the fluxes to total assuming psf profiles .",
    "this amounts to a factor 1.8 in both the [ 3.6 ] and the [ 4.5 ] irac filters .",
    "the local background is estimated from the stacks , in a ring between 6and 10diameters around the stamp center , where the source is expected to be , and then subtracted off the image .    to estimate the uncertainty in the irac stacks",

    "we treat the two epochs of irac data over the hudf as independent stamps in the stack , thereby effectively weighting with exposure time , i.e. , @xmath68 . in each bootstrap draw , then , we draw with replacement @xmath69 such stamps , and estimate fluxes as described above . the image noise in each stacks is expected to decrease with the total equivalent exposure time approximately as @xmath70 ( @xmath71hr ) .",

    "the seds in the three @xmath103 bins have been re - normalized according to their @xmath103 luminosity and combined to produce over - sampled seds , which take advantage of the fact that the different filters probe different rest - frame wavelengths at the different redshifts .",
    "the combined seds show the typical flat uv slopes , but also rather flat colors in the rest - frame optical , albeit with a relatively large scatter .",
    "this scatter can in part be a consequence of the normalization which is done in the far uv , which effectively acts as the pivot point .",
    "different emission lines that sometimes contribute flux in the irac bands , depending on the redshift , can also be contributing to this scatter .",

    "we also find that the @xmath325-[4.5])$ ] color is consistently blue , with typical values of @xmath326mags .",
    "this color is very hard to reproduce with a model with any star formation history that is based only on stellar continuum .",
    "the addition of dust only makes the comparison worse ( figure [ fig : agemodels]c , d ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the uncertainties in this color are considerable and that in most cases the observed color is formally consistent with the stellar continuum only models .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that at some of these redshifts , particularly @xmath59 and 7 , the seds could be better fit by very young stellar population models ( @xmath327 myr old ) with moderate dust content and very strong nebular emission lines .",
    "these lines would dominate the rest - frame optical fluxes . as the galaxies are forming stars ,",
    "it is likely that they have nebular emission lines , and so we have assessed whether emission lines could be influencing our fluxes and fits .",
    "the observed position of the most prominent optical nebular emission lines at each redshift is marked in figure [ fig : seds ] by the dashed vertical lines ( assuming the mean redshift of each sample ) .",
    "it can be seen that at the different redshifts involved , some of the rest - frame optical emission lines would lie within the irac [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] filters .",
    "@xcite showed recently that at @xmath328 there are sources that show emission lines with large enough equivalent widths to dominate the broadband fluxes in the optical .",
    "however , even for their sample of high equivalent width selected sources , such objects are not very common . for the more typical cases , the lines that they find in their sample would have moderate contributions to the irac broad bands , usually making them @xmath329mags brighter . at higher redshifts , @xmath330 , the work of @xcite , based on spectroscopic redshifts and irac broadband photometry , finds similar results .",
    "they find that the sources in this redshift range show an excess of flux in [ 3.6 ] over [ 4.5 ] , which the authors think can be explained by h@xmath331 emission .",
    "the majority of the sources in their sample have @xmath325-[4.5])$ ] colors that are consistent with an h@xmath331 contribution of @xmath329mags to the [ 3.6 ] filter , indicating moderate contributions from emission lines .",
    "we consider the effects of a similar ( moderate ) contribution of emission lines to the colors of a 280myr old csf model .",
    "for the purpose of this exercise we assume a h@xmath331 rest - frame equivalent width @xmath332 . at @xmath59",
    ", this would increase the luminosity in the [ 4.5 ] filter by 0.23mag .",
    "we only consider the strongest lines in the optical and assume the strength ratios presented by @xcite for a @xmath333 metallicity system .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath334 , respectively .",
    "the open squares in figure [ fig : agemodels]a , b , correspond to the median colors for a model like the one described ( the median takes into account the expected redshift distribution of each sample ) .    as can be seen in figure [ fig : agemodels]a , the main effect of the contribution from the emission lines is that it allows for significantly younger ages to reproduce the @xmath320 $ ] colors ( by roughly a factor of two ) .",
    "since this implies lower stellar continuum fluxes than previously assumed , this would also result in lower best fit stellar masses than previously estimated for galaxies at these redshifts ( by a similar factor ) .",
    "simultaneously , given the line ratios and the redshift distributions expected for these samples , a model like this can also help in reproducing the blue [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors of the seds at @xmath13 ( figure [ fig : agemodels]b ) . while formally models with just stellar continua can fit the data , given the current large uncertainties , such colors are hard to obtain with stellar continuum only models .",
    "it is more likely that some degree of contribution of emission lines provides a better solution .",
    "the assessment presented here is necessarily very simplistic , given the current uncertainties , and is only meant to show the possible effects of emission lines on the colors of these galaxies .",
    "better estimates of the contribution of these lines and its effects on the properties derived from sed fitting will depend on the actual strengths and ratios of the lines .",
    "moderate improvement can be achieved if more precise redshifts are known for these sources , such data does not exist at this time for such faint high redshift galaxies and so this remains an open question until improved spectroscopic capability becomes available .      regarding the trend of redder uv - to - optical colors for brighter uv - luminosities presented in figure [ fig : leebetaandutov ] for the @xmath4 sample",
    ", it can also be observed for the other samples .",
    "in fact , within the uncertainties in the color determination , the @xmath320 $ ] vs @xmath103 trend is roughly the same at @xmath58 and 6 ( figure [ fig : colormag ] , _ top _ ) .",
    "this is particularly remarkable in view of the fact that this color is an observed color , not a rest - frame color , and in consequence is probing different wavelengths for the different samples .",
    "this shows again how similar and flat these seds are .",
    "if all the seds are considered simultaneously , a trend of @xmath256 = -0.12(\\pm0.07 ) \\times m_{1500,ab}+const$ ] , is found . for simple csf models ,",
    "this trend implies a variation in stellar m / l ratio .",
    "@xcite find that at @xmath4 , this variation is of a factor @xmath335 between @xmath336 and @xmath337 .",
    "so , despite the steep uv - luminosity functions characteristic at @xmath17 , the contribution of the faintest sources to the total stellar mass density is more modest than their contribution to the star formation rate density .",
    "similar to the analysis performed at @xmath4 , we have derived rest - frame @xmath98 colors for the median seds at all redshifts . these colors are shown in figure [ fig : colormag ] .",
    "the trend with uv - luminosity has large scatter and low significance but is systematic in the sense that brighter sources are redder in @xmath99 .",
    "a fit to the rest - frame colors as a function of m@xmath338 of all redshifts simultaneously , results in @xmath339 , shown as the brown dashed line in figure [ fig : colormag ] ( _ center _ panel ) .",
    "this is slightly steeper than the @xmath340 slope found for the @xmath4 data only , also plotted for reference as the black dashed line in the same figure .",
    "the latter trend included the bright sample of @xcite and is consistent within the uncertainties with the fit to all the points .    using the median trends determined by @xcite regarding the @xmath18 slopes vs. uv - luminosity for @xmath341 lbgs",
    ", we corrected the @xmath342 colors for dust extinction using the @xcite relation ( figure [ fig : colormag ] , _ bottom _ ) .",
    "these corrected colors show large scatter around @xmath343 but there is no indication of a residual trend with uv - luminosity except for the @xmath3 sample ( black symbols ) .",
    "this may indicate again that at @xmath344 , the evolution can be fully explained by a change in dust content and there is no strong evolution in the ages of these sources as a function of uv - luminosity .",
    "this is consistent with the report by @xcite based on stellar population modeling of slightly brighter lbgs in this redshift range .",
    "it is also consistent with the predictions from the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite , which find no trend of age with uv - luminosity .    at @xmath3",
    "there seems to be a residual trend in @xmath345 vs. uv - luminosity in the sense that brighter sources have systematically bluer intrinsic @xmath98 colors . in principle",
    ", this could indicate that the brighter sources are actually younger than the fainter sources , which would be difficult to imagine .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the simple dust corrections ( calibrated at @xmath322 ) are not adequate at these high redshifts , due to , for example , changes in the imf , metallicity , or escape fraction , all of which could alter the uv - slope @xmath18 for a given dust content .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath18 vs. uv - luminosity at @xmath3 is considerably steeper than at the other redshifts and so the corrections to the @xmath99 vs. uv - luminosity trend are more extreme .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties are sufficiently large that also the @xmath3 trend is fully consistent with being constant .",
    "determining the rest - frame uv - to - optical colors of individual uv - faint galaxies at @xmath17 is challenging . at such redshifts the rest - frame optical lies at @xmath346 microns in the mid - ir and",
    "so it is hard to measure at the extremely faint magnitudes typical of galaxies in the first 1.5 gyr . to gain insight into the typical spectral properties of @xmath347 galaxies ,",
    "we have taken advantage of the large samples of @xmath347 sources found in the deep hst acs and wfc3/ir images of the ers and hudf fields .",
    "the hst data give us rest - frame uv fluxes .",
    "we then use @xmath0/irac [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] micron data from the deep goods survey of these fields to get rest - frame optical fluxes by stacking the irac images and determining median flux values .",

    "to quantify the rest - frame optical properties of very faint high - redshift galaxies , we stack the irac images for a large number of faint galaxies , after removing the flux contribution from nearby neighbors ( section 4 ) .",
    "while we do not expect large systematics in the photometry of individual sources from our deblending procedure to remove neighboring sources , it is possible that modest systematics could arise when stacking a large number of sources .",
    "the role of this appendix is to determine how large such systematics might be .",
    "fortunately we are able to demonstrate that the fluxes that we measure in the stacked irac images are unbiased and that their significance is properly determined .",
    "we started by selecting 200 empty areas in the hudf field .",
    "we select them based on the segmentation maps derived from the high resolution hst images .",
    "we processed each of the selected empty areas as if they were the position of one of the real sources in our catalog , i.e. we ran them through the de - blending code to remove the flux from nearby un - associated sources . to determine the rms for a given @xmath359 number of stacked stamps , we randomly draw ( with replacement ) @xmath359 stamps from the 200 empty areas , median combine them and perform aperture photometry in the median stack in the same fashion as for our real stacks .",
    "we repeat the drawing 300 times and measure the rms of these 300 trials . as can be seen in the upper panel of figure [ fig : stacklimits ] , the limiting flux decreases as @xmath360 , as expected for background - limited noise . in the case of the stacks that contain real sources ,",
    "the rms is larger than the image noise because it is also affected by the intrinsic variation in the distribution of fluxes that are being stacked .",
    "limiting flux ( in @xmath94jy ) as a function of the number of irac stamps stacked .",
    "all the stamps have the same integration time of @xmath361h .",
    "the estimates ( open symbols ) come from stacking large numbers of empty areas of the goods images .",
    "each empty area was cleaned of neighboring fluxes using the code described in the text .",
    "the noise decreases @xmath362 , with n being the number of empty regions stacked .",
    "the filled symbols are the actual rms determined for each of our stacked stamps : blue for the @xmath4 stamps , green @xmath58 , and red @xmath59 ( see figures [ fig : bstackstamp ] , [ fig : vstackstamp ] , and [ fig : istackstamp ] ) .",
    "these rms values are @xmath363 than the ones derived for empty regions .",
    "this is expected because the uncertainties in the stack include both the image noise and intrinsic variations in the population being stacked . _",
