    "-5 mm    the organisers requested a talk which would both be a colloquium style talk understandable to a wide spectrum of mathematicians and one which would survey the recent developments in the subject .",
    "i have found it hard to meet both desiderata , and have opted to concentrate on the former .",
    "thus the first three sections of this paper contain a simple presentation of a web of deep conjectures connecting galois representations to algebraic geometry , complex analysis and discrete subgroups of lie groups .",
    "this will be of no interest to the specialist .",
    "my hope is that the result is not too banal and that it will give the non - specialist some idea of what motivates work in this area .",
    "i should stress that nothing i write here is original . in the final section",
    "i briefly review some of what is known about these conjectures and _ very briefly _ mention some of the available techniques .",
    "i also mention two questions which lie outside the topic we are discussing , but which would have important implications for it .",
    "maybe someone can make progress on them ?",
    "we will let @xmath1 denote the field of rational numbers and @xmath2 denote the field of algebraic numbers , the algebraic closure of @xmath1 .",
    "we will also let @xmath3 denote the group of automorphisms of @xmath2 , that is @xmath4 , the absolute galois group of @xmath1 .",
    "although it is not the simplest it is arguably the most natural galois group to study .",
    "an important technical point is that @xmath3 is naturally a ( profinite ) topological group , a basis of open neighbourhoods of the identity being given by the subgroups @xmath5 as @xmath6 runs over subextensions of @xmath7 which are finite over @xmath1 .    to my mind",
    "the galois theory of @xmath1 is most interesting when one looks not only at @xmath3 as an abstract ( topological ) group , but as a group with certain additional structures associated to the prime numbers .",
    "i will now briefly describe these structures .    for each prime number @xmath8",
    "we may define an absolute value @xmath9 if @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 integers coprime to @xmath8 .",
    "if we complete @xmath1 with respect to this absolute value we obtain the field of @xmath8-adic numbers @xmath13 , a totally disconnected , locally compact topological field .",
    "we will write @xmath14 for its absolute galois group , @xmath15 .",
    "the absolute value @xmath16 has a unique extension to an absolute value on @xmath17 and @xmath14 is identified with the group of automorphisms of @xmath17 which preserve @xmath16 , or equivalently the group of continuous automorphisms of @xmath17 . for each embedding @xmath18",
    "we obtain a closed embedding @xmath19 and as the embedding @xmath18 varies we obtain a conjugacy class of closed embeddings @xmath19 .",
    "slightly abusively , we shall consider @xmath14 a closed subgroup of @xmath3 , suppressing the fact that the embedding is only determined up to conjugacy .",
    "this can be compared with the situation ` at infinity ' .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the usual archimedean absolute value on @xmath1 .",
    "the completion of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath20 is the field of real numbers @xmath21 and its algebraic closure is @xmath22 the field of complex numbers .",
    "each embedding @xmath23 gives rise to a closed embedding @xmath24 as the embedding @xmath23 varies one obtains a conjugacy class of elements @xmath25 of order @xmath26 , which we refer to as complex conjugations .",
    "there are however many important differences between the case of finite places ( i.e. primes ) and the infinite place @xmath27 is an infinite extension and @xmath17 is not complete .",
    "we will denote its completion by @xmath28 .",
    "the galois group @xmath14 acts on @xmath28 and is in fact the group of continuous automorphisms of @xmath28 .    the elements of @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) with absolute value less than or equal to @xmath29 , form a closed subring @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) . these rings are local with maximal ideals @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) consisting of the elements with absolute value strictly less than @xmath29 .",
    "the field @xmath34 is an algebraic closure of the finite field with @xmath8 elements @xmath35 , and we will denote it by @xmath36 .",
    "thus we obtain a continuous map @xmath37 which is surjective .",
    "its kernel is called the inertia subgroup of @xmath14 and is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the group @xmath39 is procyclic and has a canonical generator called the ( geometric ) frobenius element and defined by @xmath40 in many circumstances it is technically convenient to replace @xmath14 by a dense subgroup @xmath41 , which is referred to as the weil group of @xmath13 and which is defined as the subgroup of @xmath42 such that @xmath43 maps to @xmath44 we endow @xmath41 with a topology by decreeing that @xmath38 with its usual topology should be an open subgroup of @xmath41 .",
    "we will take a moment to describe some of the finer structure of @xmath38 which we will need for technical purposes later .",
    "first of all there is a ( not quite canonical ) continuous surjection @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath48 is a pro-@xmath8-group called the wild inertia group .",
    "the fixed field @xmath49 is obtained by adjoining @xmath50{p}$ ] to @xmath51 for all @xmath52 coprime to @xmath8 and @xmath53{p } = \\zeta_n^{t(\\sigma ) } \\sqrt[n]{p},\\ ] ] for some primitive @xmath54-root of unity @xmath55 ( independent of @xmath43 , but dependent on @xmath48 ) .",
    "i want to focus here on attempts to describe @xmath3 via its representations .",
    "perhaps the most obvious representations to consider are those representations @xmath58 with open kernel , and these so called artin representations are already very interesting .",
    "however one obtains a richer theory if one considers representations @xmath59 which are continuous with respect to the @xmath60-adic topology on @xmath61 .",
    "we refer to these as _",
    "@xmath60-adic representations_.      1 .   a choice of embeddings @xmath23 and @xmath62 establishes a bijection between isomorphism classes of artin representations and isomorphism classes of @xmath60-adic representations with open kernel .",
    "thus artin representations are a special case of @xmath60-adic representations : those with finite image .",
    "2 .   there is a unique character @xmath63 such that @xmath64 for all @xmath60-power roots of unity @xmath65 .",
    "this is called the @xmath60-adic _ cyclotomic character_. 3 .",
    "if @xmath66 is a smooth projective variety ( and we choose an embedding @xmath67 ) then the natural action of @xmath3 on the cohomology @xmath68 is an @xmath60-adic representation .",
    "for instance if @xmath69 is an elliptic curve then we have the concrete description @xmath70({\\overline{{{{\\mathbb{q } } } } } } ) , { \\overline{{{{\\mathbb{q}}}}}}_l ) \\cong { \\overline{{{{\\mathbb{q}}}}}}_l^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the @xmath72-torsion points on @xmath73 .",
    "we will write @xmath74 for the twist @xmath75    before discussing @xmath60-adic representations of @xmath3 further , let us take a moment to look at @xmath60-adic representations of @xmath14",
    ". the cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 are very different . consider first the much easier case @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath60-adic representations of @xmath14 are not much different from representations of @xmath41 with open kernel .",
    "more precisely define a _",
    "wd - representation _ of @xmath41 over a field @xmath73 to be a pair @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a finite dimensional @xmath73-vector space , @xmath82 is a representation with open kernel and @xmath83 is a nilpotent endomorphism which satisfies @xmath84 for every lift @xmath85 of @xmath86 .",
    "the key point here is that there is no reference to a topology on @xmath73 , indeed no assumption that @xmath73 is a topological field .",
    "given @xmath82 there are up to isomorphism only finitely many choices for the pair @xmath87 and these can be explicitly listed without difficulty .",
    "a wd - representation @xmath87 is called _ unramified _ if @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ". it is called frobenius semi - simple if @xmath82 is semi - simple . any wd - representation",
    "@xmath87 has a canonical frobenius semi - simplification @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the case that @xmath91 we call @xmath87 @xmath60-integral if all the eigenvalues of @xmath92 have absolute value @xmath29 .",
    "this is independent of the choice of frobenius lift @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath78 , then there is an equivalence of categories between @xmath60-integral wd - representations of @xmath41 over @xmath94 and @xmath60-adic representations of @xmath14 . to describe it choose a frobenius lift @xmath85 and a surjection @xmath95 .",
    "up to natural isomorphism the equivalence does not depend on these choices .",
    "we associate to an @xmath60-integral wd - representation @xmath87 the unique @xmath60-adic representation sending @xmath96 for all @xmath97 and @xmath47 .",
    "the key point is grothendieck s observation that for @xmath78 any @xmath60-adic representation of @xmath14 must be trivial on some open subgroup of the wild inertia group",
    ". we will write @xmath98 for the wd - representation associated to an @xmath60-adic representation @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath98 is unramified if and only if @xmath100 . in this case",
    "we call @xmath99 _ unramified_.    the case @xmath77 is much more complicated because there are many more @xmath8-adic representations of @xmath14 .",
    "these have been extensively studied by fontaine and his co - workers .",
    "they single out certain @xmath8-adic representations which they call _ de rham _ representations .",
    "i will not recall the somewhat involved definition here ( see however @xcite and @xcite ) , but note that ` most ' @xmath8-adic representations of @xmath14 are not de rham . to any de rham representation @xmath99 of @xmath14 on a @xmath17-vector space @xmath81 they associate the following .    1 .   a wd - representation @xmath98 of @xmath41 over @xmath17 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "we now return to the global situation ( i.e. to the study of @xmath107 ) .",
    "the @xmath60-adic representations of @xmath3 that arise ` in nature ' , by which i mean ` from geometry ' , have a number of very special properties which i will now list .",
    "let @xmath108 be a subquotient of @xmath74 for some smooth projective variety @xmath66 and some integers @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    1 .   ( grothendieck )",

    "a remarkable conjecture of birch and swinnerton - dyer @xcite predicts that @xmath183 has infinitely many rational solutions if and only if @xmath184 .",
    "again we point out that it is the behaviour of the @xmath0-function at a point where it is only defined by analytic continuation , which is governing the arithmetic of @xmath73 .",
    "this conjecture has been proved ( see @xcite ) when @xmath180 has at most a simple zero at @xmath167 .",
    "one general setting in which one can define @xmath0-functions is @xmath60-adic representations . let us look first at the local setting .",

    "we hope that this extra abstraction will not be too confusing for the novice .    before continuing our introduction of automorphic forms",
    "let us digress to mention class field theory , which provides a concrete example of the presentational advantages of the adelic language .",
    "it also implies essentially all the conjectures we are considering in the case of one dimensional galois representations .",
    "indeed this article is about the search for a non - abelian analogue of class field theory .",
