    "while long - lived activity is no guarantee of cometary activity @xcite , the photometric behavior of p/2012 t1 is certainly inconsistent with dust particles ejected impulsively in an impact .",
    "its steady brightening implies the action of a prolonged dust ejection mechanism like sublimation .",
    "furthermore , while apparently long - lived activity could be due to the long dissipation times of large particles ejected by an impact , p/2012  t1 s eventual fading after several weeks suggests that this is not the case here , since such large particles would be expected to persist much longer ( cf .",

    "we generate nine sets of 100 dynamical clones of p/2012 t1 that are gaussian - distributed in orbital element space and centered on the object s osculating orbital elements as of 2012 december 1 .",

    "non - gravitational forces are not considered in this analysis .    in these simulations , less than 5% of the test particles reach heliocentric distances of @xmath35  au ( and are therefore considered to have been ejected from the asteroid belt ) over the 100  myr test period .",
    "the remaining test particles diverge to occupy regions of orbital element space that are larger than their initial distributions but that are also essentially independent of those initial distributions , i.e. , the 1-@xmath31 sets of test particles diverge to occupy similar regions as the 100-@xmath31 sets ( figure  [ fig_stability ] ) .",
    "this divergence occurs quickly ( within @xmath36  years ) and remains approximately constant over the 100  myr test period .",
    "we therefore find that p/2012 t1 is largely dynamically stable and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper , though we do note that the ejection of a small number of test particles indicates that the region is not perfectly stable over the considered time period .",
    "mbcs 133p and p/2006 vw@xmath6 have recently been found to be dynamical members of very young ( @xmath3710  myr ) asteroid families @xcite .",
    "these findings are interesting because the surfaces of ice - bearing main - belt objects may become significantly collisionally devolatilized on timescales of @xmath38  gyr @xcite . however , if mbcs only originated in the recent fragmentation events that created the aforementioned young families , their surfaces should have experienced far less collisional devolatilization , and thus remain susceptible to activation by small impactors ( cf .",

    "while we currently lack a sufficient sample size to ascertain whether there is a significant overabundance of mbcs in young families , the fact that two of seven mbcs ( @xmath030% ) are found to belong to such families is suggestive of a physical correlation .    to test whether p/2012 t1 originated in a recent fragmentation event , we search for an associated dynamical family utilizing a hierarchical clustering analysis @xcite . using computed proper elements of @xmath39  au , @xmath40 , and @xmath41",
    ", we find that p/2012  t1 belongs to the @xmath0155  myr - old lixiaohua asteroid family @xcite .",
    "while the lixiaohua family is of intermediate age , p/2012  t1 could belong to an even younger sub - family , much as the young beagle and p/2006 vw@xmath6 families are both sub - groups of the much older themis family @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the density of asteroids in the region of orbital element space occupied by the lixiaohua family is extremely high .",
    "in fact , most lixiaohua family members , including p/2012 t1 , are linked to the family at cut - off velocities as low as 20  m  s@xmath3 . as such , identification of a younger sub - family for p/2012 t1",

    "currently , the key question that must be answered when a main - belt object exhibits comet - like activity is whether that activity is sublimation - driven , implying the presence of ice , or is produced by another means .",
    "definitive evidence of sublimation would be the direct detection of a gaseous sublimation product such as cn or h@xmath42o in the coma of such an object .",

    "private communication ) . while these results do not definitively rule out sublimation",
    ", they do indicate that the production rates of sublimation products by mbcs are too low to detect from current earth - bound facilities .",
    "as such , we must rely on indirect evidence to determine the likely source of comet - like activity in main - belt objects .",
    "@xcite examined various mechanisms by which an asteroid - like body could undergo comet - like mass loss , including ice sublimation , impact ejection , rotational instability , and electrostatic levitation , finding that in many individual cases of comet - like objects , the cause of observed mass loss could not be definitively identified due to insufficient observational data .",
    "nonetheless , certain mechanisms could sometimes be ruled out based on physical and observational constraints .",
    "for example , electrostatic levitation was ruled out as a cause of 133p s observed activity because it would have depleted the supply of mobile surface dust during a single active episode , leaving no obvious source of mobile dust for subsequent active episodes @xcite .",
    "the rapid rotation of 133p also minimizes the amount of electrostatic charging that can occur given the short time that any portion of the object s surface spends in sunlight @xcite .",
    "this mechanism s efficacy furthermore depends on unknown cohesive properties of asteroid regolith dust grains @xcite .",
    "finally , given the many asteroids similar to 133p with more favorable rotational properties , it is unclear why 133p would exhibit observable dust levitation while other asteroids do not .",
    "dust ejection via rotational spin - up , perhaps via the yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievsky - paddack ( yorp ) effect @xcite , was also ruled out due to the lack of a plausible mechanism for producing repeated activity or explaining the rarity of similar activity on other asteroids .",
    "@xcite did note that for an object exhibiting repeated activity , sublimation appears to be the only reasonable explanation .",
    "repeated activity has only been established for 133p and 238p , however , with others either failing to exhibit repeated activity upon completion of a full orbit period since its previously observed active episode ( 176p ) , or not yet having completed one full orbit since their first observed active episodes ( 259p , p/2010 r2 , p/2006 vw@xmath6 , and p/2012 t1 ) .    as discussed in section  [ photresults ] ,",
    "p/2012  t1 s observed photometric behavior indicates ongoing and even increasing dust production over several weeks ( figure  [ fig_observations]c ) , consistent with continuous sublimation - driven dust ejection and inconsistent with impulsive impact - driven dust ejection .",
    "the comet also exhibits a diffuse coma and a featureless fan - like tail that remains aligned with the antisolar direction , distinctly different from the crossed filamentary structure of p/2010 a2 s tail , the three - plumed morphology of ( 596 ) scheila s dust tail , and the orbit - plane - aligned dust trail of p/2012 f5 @xcite .",
    "the post - perihelion peaking of p/2012 t1 s activity is also consistent with the post - perihelion peaking of activity for other mbcs @xcite . while we can not yet definitively conclude that p/2012 t1 s activity is sublimation - driven , we note that all evidence examined thus far is consistent with sublimation .",
    "we therefore find that p/2012 t1 is most likely a true mbc , and not a disrupted asteroid , though additional observations ( e.g. , to search for repeated activity during its next perihelion passage in mid-2018 ) and more detailed dust modeling will be required to definitively rule out other dust ejection mechanisms .",
    "a primary ultimate objective of mbc studies is to connect observations of the distribution and composition of volatiles in small primitive bodies to the distribution of volatiles in the protoplanetary disk , and to link this through disk observations to other forming planetary systems @xcite .",
    "presently , we have insufficient information to make these connections , in part because we have few direct constraints on the volatile content of small bodies and because our solar system s precise dynamical history remains poorly understood",
    ". further work on both fronts would help this situation , though significantly advancing our understanding of volatile material in the asteroid belt may require in - situ investigation , e.g. , by a visiting spacecraft .",

    "<S> we present initial results from observations and numerical analyses aimed at characterizing main - belt comet p/2012 t1 ( panstarrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> optical monitoring observations were made between october 2012 and february 2013 using the university of hawaii 2.2  m telescope , the keck i telescope , the baade and clay magellan telescopes , faulkes telescope south , the perkins telescope at lowell observatory , and the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the object s intrinsic brightness approximately doubles from the time of its discovery in early october until mid - november and then decreases by @xmath060% between late december and early february , similar to photometric behavior exhibited by several other main - belt comets and unlike that exhibited by disrupted asteroid ( 596 ) scheila . </S>",
    "<S> we also used keck to conduct spectroscopic searches for cn emission as well as absorption at 0.7  @xmath1 m that could indicate the presence of hydrated minerals , finding an upper limit cn production rate of @xmath2  mol  s@xmath3 , from which we infer a water production rate of @xmath4  mol  s@xmath3 , and no evidence of the presence of hydrated minerals . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations indicate that p/2012 t1 is largely dynamically stable for @xmath5  myr and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper from the outer solar system , while a search for potential asteroid family associations reveal that it is dynamically linked to the @xmath0155  myr - old lixiaohua asteroid family . </S>"
