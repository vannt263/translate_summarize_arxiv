    "despite of the severe foreground contamination , the cmb @xmath0 modes are expected to carry most important details on the nature of cosmological perturbations , as we stressed in the introduction .",
    "for this reason it is worth to study data analysis techniques capable to clean the cmb from foreground contamination .",
    "this is feasible by exploiting the statistical differences of cmb and diffuse foregrounds , starting from a wide enough multi - frequency coverage of a given observation .",
    "the data can be sketched as @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the data at the @xmath35 frequencies , @xmath36 the @xmath37 components corresponding to each emission , and @xmath38 the instrumental noise ; @xmath39 is the mixing matrix , scaling and mixing the emissions @xmath36 at any observed frequency , while @xmath40 is the number of pixels of the observation , or equivalently the number of harmonic coefficients if the analysis is performed in the spectral domain .",

    "we stress that this is without the use of any prior , i.e. not knowing any piece of * a * or @xmath36 .",
    "the algorithm knows only the data at the two frequencies , and looks for the most statistically independent components in those data .",
    "in addition , applying this technique in particular is computationally free : the results in figure were obtained in about five minutes on an ordinary single processor personal computer .",
    "+ in particular , the cmb @xmath0 modes have been impressively cleaned : interpreting the foreground emission as noise , the signal to noise ratio is 0.1 or less , at all multipoles , as it can bee seen in the right panel of the figure .",
    "cmb @xmath3 modes have also been cleaned wherever the foreground contamination was relevant .",
    "the algorithm outputs also * a * , which differs from the real one by percent or less .",
    "the reason of such an excellent performance is just the high level of detail of the underlying data . at arcmin .",
    "resolution , the maps are almost ideal datasets where the algorithm can look for the least statistically linked templates present into the maps themselves .",
    "even if all the instrumental details were neglected , what we show here should be enough to gather attention on these new data analysis techniques , as we further stress in the next section .",
    "in this work we show that at frequencies around 100 ghz the diffuse galactic polarisation emission is likely to be rather weak in comparison to the cmb @xmath5 and @xmath3 modes , at least at medium and high galactic latitudes , while the @xmath0 ones are seriously contaminated on all sky . at lower and higher frequencies ,",
    "the contamination gets rapidly worse because of the steep frequency behavior of synchrotron and dust , respectively .",
    "we stress that the new concepts in signal processing science can be exploited in this context , to cancel or greatly reduce such a contamination .",
    "in particular , the statistical independence of cmb and foreground emission is suitable to achieve this goal : we give an impressive example based on the technique in polarisation @xcite , where cmb @xmath0 modes are recovered out of a foreground emission about ten times stronger , without any prior information but their statistical independence , and at an almost null computational cost .",
    "these features represent the  nominal \" capabilities of these algorithms , i.e. their performance on ideal datasets : cleaning the cosmological signal from substantial foreground contamination , exploiting only their natural diversity .",
    "this is in our opinion a great achievement , providing the basis on which the implementation to any particular observation can be built .",
    "the latter step , of course , presents challenging issues : the noise level , sky distribution and non - stationarity , as well as the non - uniform spectral index of the components to recover , are good examples .",
    "however , we have already the indications of a substantial stability of the nominal performance against instrumental features and systematics : @xcite and @xcite , respectively for total intensity and polarisation , perform a whitening of simulated planck data in order to get rid of the noise bulk in the separation process .",
    "most importantly , the results of @xcite show that these techniques are flexible enough to be applied to real data , the cobe ones , getting outstanding results , namely the correct large scale cmb power spectrum amplitude and shape .    while waiting for the era of large scale cmb polarisation measurements ,",
