    "galactic - scale outflows are now generally recognized to be important phenomena affecting or even regulating the evolution of galaxies .",
    "starburst - driven winds , powered by the combined kinetic energy released in the outflows from massive stars and supernovae , are capable of depositing metals , dust and energy into the galaxy halo and beyond ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". in galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , radiation - driven agn winds and collimated outflows of radio plasma , or `` jets '' , offer another effective mechanism of transporting large amounts of energy and momentum out of the nucleus . in recent years",
    ", both processes have been implied in disrupting / fragmenting the obscuring cocoon in merger remnants @xcite .    in ultraluminous infrared galaxies",
    "( ulirgs ; l@xmath4=10@xmath5l@xmath6 ) , molecular gas driven into the merging nuclei by the galaxy interaction is capable of supporting both a prolonged massive starburst and/or feeding a ( nascent ) agn .",
    "this makes ulirgs prime candidates for observing extreme agn and/or starburst driven outflows .",
    "indeed , observations of the interstellar na i - d absorption line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and optical forbidden low and medium ionization lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that outflows are ubiquitous in ulirgs and that the momentum and energy injection is in most cases dominated by the starburst @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared kinematic studies of forbidden line emission in agn and ulirgs are scarce . in their iso - sws survey of local agn , @xcite reported the detection of line asymmetries and line shifts for some of their sources .",
    "detailed studies could , however , only be performed for the two brightest agns , ngc4151 @xcite and ngc1068 @xcite . for these",
    "it was determined that dust entrained in outflows can not explain the observed asymmetries in optical forbidden lines",
    ". with the advent of spitzer - irs sensitive medium - resolution spectroscopy has become available for kinematic studies of agn and ulirgs at a resolving power @xmath7=600 .",
    "@xcite have exploited these capabilities and found the line widths of the high - ionization agn narrow line tracers 14.32@xmath3 m [ nev ] and 25.89@xmath3 m [ oiv ] to be correlated with the black hole mass for agns for which the narrow line region is dominated by virial motion .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented the discovery of strongly blueshifted ionized ne@xmath8 , ne@xmath9 and ne@xmath10 gas in three ulirgs and proposed that the outflowing gas may be tracing the disruption of the obscuring medium around buried agns in these mergers . in this letter",
    "we report the mid - infrared discovery of strongly blue shifted neon line emission in another 22 ulirgs .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on high resolution ( @xmath7@xmath11600 ; @xmath0@xmath12500 km s@xmath2 ) 1037@xmath3 m spitzer @xcite irs @xcite spectra of ulirgs , agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "the core sample is formed by the irs gto sample @xcite which is not complete in any sense .",
    "all sources were observed in staring mode .",
    "the 1019.5@xmath3 m portion of the spectra were obtained in the irs short high ( sh ) module and the 19.337@xmath3 m sections in the long high ( lh ) module .",
    "the data reduction proceeded along the same steps as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the wavelength calibration of our spectra should be accurate to about 1/5 ( ssc priv .",
    "comm . ) of a resolution element ( 500 km s@xmath2 ) , which amounts to 100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the accuracy is however known to vary from order to order and is generally lowest near the order edges and best toward the order center .",
    "we have used the non - linear least squares fitting idl package mpfit @xcite to perform single and double component gauss fits to the high - resolution spitzer emission line spectra of the galaxies in our sample . with these fits",
    "we computed the full width and velocity center at 20% of the peak flux ( fw20 and vc20 , respectively ) for all detected lines .",
    "our choice of evaluating at the 20% level rather than at the 50% level is motivated by the presence of weak blue wings in the neon lines .",
    "in this particular study we focus on the mid - infrared fine structure lines of neon , because of their large range in ionization potential ( ip = 21 , 41 , 97 and 127ev for ne@xmath8 , ne@xmath9 , ne@xmath10 and ne@xmath13 , respectively ) and their superior detectability compared to fine - structure lines of argon and sulphur . also , the rest wavelengths of the five neon lines are well away from the strong si  o stretching resonance of amorphous silicate grains at 812@xmath3 m which is responsible for a factor 35 increase in opacity compared to surrounding wavelengths . furthermore , the three strongest lines , 12.81@xmath3 m [ ne ii ] , 15.56@xmath3 m [ ne iii ] and 14.32@xmath3 m [ ne v ] , all fall within the same irs slit , sh , for redshifts up to 0.25 . at higher redshifts the 15.56@xmath3 m [ ne iii ] line shifts from the sh slit into the lh slit , while above z=0.32 the 7.65@xmath3 m [ ne vi ] line shifts into the sh slit .",
    "our neon line sample consists of 82 ulirgs , 3 hylirgs , 33 agns ( both seyferts and qsos ) and 15 starburst galaxies suited for detailed line profile analysis .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we plot for the [ ne iii ] and [ ne v ] lines the fw20 as a function of vc20 for all sources in our sample .",
    "the panels strikingly illustrate the predominance of blue over red shifts among the neon line detections , and the tendency for the vc20 blue shift to be correlated with the fw20 line width .",
    "the latter appears to be best established for the [ ne iii ] line .    among our ulirg sample",
    "25/82 sources ( 30% ) show blue shifted [ ne iii ] and/or [ ne v ] emission .",
    "this fraction excludes sources with vc20 blue shifts less than 200 km s@xmath2 , for which we can not rule out uncertainties in the order - to - order wavelength calibration to mimick a real blue shift .",
    "21/25 ulirgs ( 84% ) are optically classified as agn . among the 32/82 ulirgs with a [",
    "ne v ] detection , the [ ne v ] line is found to be blue shifted ( vc20@xmath14 - 200 km s@xmath2 ) for 19 ulirgs ( 59% ) , 6 of which are optically classified as type - i and 10 as type - ii agn .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the broadest [ nev ] lines not showing clear indications for blue shifts have fw20 line widths of 1500 km s@xmath2 . assuming these lines to arise in nlr gas in keplerian rotation around the central black hole , equation 1 of @xcite predicts their black hole masses to be of the order of 10@xmath15m@xmath6 .    in figs.[fig2 ] and",
    "[ fig3 ] we show overlays of the velocity profiles of the mid - infrared neon lines for 16 sources which have [ neiii ] vc20 line center blue shifts of 200 km s@xmath2 or more .",
    "the sources are sorted by decreasing fw20 of the [ neiii ] line .",
    "eleven of these are optically classified as agn .",
    "the 16 panels reveal a great diversity in line shapes and line center shifts , both from line to line for a single target , as well as from object to object . in some sources",
    "the vc20 line center shift is the result of a pronounced blue wing to the systemic component , while in others also the line peak is blue shifted .",
    "the latter is more often the case for the [ ne v ] line than for the [ ne iii ] line , and can also be more extreme .",
    "for other sources two gaussian components can be discerned , one at systemic velocity , the other at blue shifted velocities .",
    "examples are the [ ne ii ] line of iras07598 + 6508 and the [ ne iii ] line of iras154620450 . in table[tab1 ] we list the measurements of the kinematic parameters for the sources in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] along with their computed 81000@xmath3 m infrared luminosities and 1.4ghz radio luminosities .    with lines of various ionization stages of neon measured in the same aperture ,",
    "it is possible to investigate how the ionization of the gas changes as a function of velocity relative to systemic . in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we show the change in [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] and [ ne v]/[ne iii ] line ratios at velocity intervals of 750 km s@xmath2 with respect to systemic .",
    "results are only shown for those velocity bins for which the ratio - ed lines are at least 1/20 of the peak line flux throughout the central 600 km s@xmath2 of the velocity bin . for nearly all the sources for which either line ratio is defined over more than one velocity bin , the ionization appears to increase with increasing blue shift . in some cases",
    "this can be substantial , like for izw1 , where the [ ne v]/[ne iii ] ratio increases from 0.21 at systemic velocity to 1.3 in the velocity bin centered at -1500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a clear exception is irasf001837111 , for which the [ ne",
    "iii]/[ne ii ] ratio is remarkably constant over a wide velocity range @xcite .",
    "the above trends can also be recognized in a more visual way by comparing for each source which neon lines have the most pronounced blue wings .",
    "this reveals that for the large majority of sources in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the blue wing of the [ ne v ] line extends beyond that of the [ ne iii ] line , while the blue wing of the [ ne iii ] line extends beyond that of the [ ne ii ] line ; consistent with an increase in ionization with increasing blue shift .",
    "all sources in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] display an unresolved or barely resolved [ ne ii ] component at systemic velocity .",
    "some of these sources also have a [ ne iii ] or even [ ne v ] systemic component .",
    "the excitation of this neon gas holds clues as to the nature of the dominant nuclear ionizing source . in pure starburst galaxies the excitation of the nuclear starburst as measured from the [ ne iii]/[ne ii ]",
    "line ratio is usually low and in the range of 0.050.2 @xcite/[ne ii ] ratio of 0.75 @xcite ] . in our sample of sixteen excitation conditions like these",
    "are met for the systemic components of iras050241941 , iras07598 + 6508 , iras121271412ne , iras154620450 and iras15225 + 2350 . among these iras15225",
    "+ 2350 is the only source optically classified as a starburst . for other sources , like iras12514 + 1027 and iras16156 + 0146nw",
    ", the [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] ratios for the velocity component at systemic velocity are far higher , 0.97 and 0.78 , respectively . in these galaxies",
    "the agn contributes to the systemic [ ne iii ] emission , given the detection of a systemic [ ne v ] emission component .",
    "for iras051892524 and iras11119 + 3257 the clear blue shift of both the [ neiii ] and [ nev ] emission implies that none of the higher ionization gas in these sources has a keplerian component .    in fig.[fig4",
    "] we plot the fw20 line width of the [ ne iii ] and [ ne v ] lines as a function of 1.4ghz radio luminosity for all agns and ulirgs in our sample .",
    "this reveals a clear trend of increasing line width with increasing radio power .",
    "a similar trend was first found for the 5007  [ o iii ] line by @xcite and @xcite for samples of radio quiet ( l[1.4ghz]@xmath1410@xmath16w hz@xmath2 ) seyfert galaxies and qsos . in our data",
    "the trend appears to persist  albeit with some outliers ",
    "well into the radio - loud domain .",
    "the sources with strong blue shifts in their [ neiii ] lines , all labeled in red , appear to define the upper envelope of this trend or a separate one .",
    "this is especially clear in the upper panel .",
    "the only obvious exception is the prototypical narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy izw1 .",
    "note that iras07598 + 6508 is not included , as it lacks a 1.4ghz flux measurement .",
    "a striking result of our study is the identification of a sizeable subsample of sources which show a strong blue shift of the [ nev ] line center in combination with a smaller blue shift of the [ neiii ] line center ( figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) in their spectra .",
    "a per - source comparison of the [ neii ] , [ neiii ] and [ nev ] profiles strongly suggests these shifts to be the result of an increase in ionization with increasing blue shift in the line .",
    "this is supported by the behavior of the [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ nev]/[neiii ] line ratios as a function of line velocity .",
    "the most extreme sources in this subsample do not even exhibit a [ nev ] component at systemic velocity .",
    "examples are izw1 , iras051892524 , iras07598 + 6508 , iras11119 + 3257 and iras154620450 .",
    "this strongly suggests that at least in these sources the observed [ nev ] emission can not arise in nlr gas in keplerian rotation . instead",
    ", the observed line shifts and blue wings imply a nuclear outflow in a highly stratified ism , ionized by the central source ( e.g. iras13451 + 1232 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the observed increase of ionization with increasing blue shift then indicates that the bulk of the observed neon gas is moving toward us , and that the outflow speed decreases with distance to the ionizing source .",
    "the absence of a matching _ red_ward line component to the [ nev ] line implies that the line of sight to the far side of the outflow is blocked at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "note that most of these sources are also known from optical spectroscopy to exhibit outflows .",
    "nine of the 16 sources in table[tab1 ] are listed by @xcite as showing optical outflow signatures , but also izw1 and iras23060 + 0505 have known optical outflows @xcite .",
    "results similar to ours were recently reported for a sample of `` blue outlier '' nls1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "for these galaxies a similar correlation seems to exist between blue shift and line width of the 5007  [ oiii ] line as we see for the 15.56@xmath3 m [ neiii ] line ( and for the 14.32@xmath3 m [ nev ] line to a lesser degree ) .",
    "the authors favor a scenario in which gas clouds from the narrow line region are entrained in a decelerating wind , powered either by collimated radio plasma jets , or radiation pressure resulting from accretion close to or above the eddington limit .",
    "similar [ oiii ] blue shifts and line widths have also been reported for two young dust - enshrouded radio galaxies : pks154979 @xcite and iras13451 + 1232 @xcite .",
    "both are late stage mergers and the latter is one is part of our sample ( table[tab1 ] ) .",
    "the broad , blue shifted [ oiii ] emission from these sources may trace the expansion of radio jets through the obscuring shell around the buried agn @xcite .    given the high radio luminosities for iras13451 + 1232 , irasf001837111 , iras11119 + 3257 , iras121271412ne , and iras050241941 , the apparent correlation between radio luminosity and [ neiii ] line width in fig.[fig4 ] may indicate that for these sources interaction of expanding radio jets with the dense ism surrounding the agn may explain the observed neon line kinematics .",
    "four of the sources in fig.[fig2 ] which show outflow signatures in their neon lines do not show the tell - tale mid - infrared signature of agn activity , the presence of a 14.32@xmath3 m [ nev ] line , in their spectrum . while this may indicate their outflows to be starburst - driven , three of these sources , irasf001837111 , iras050241941 and iras121271412ne , display strong evidence for the presence of a powerful agn  e.g. 1.4ghz radio fluxes 410 times in excess of the value expected for star forming galaxies .",
    "in addition , irasf001837111 and iras121271412ne have silicate strengths ( s@xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) below -2.5 , indicating an apparent silicate optical depth of at least 2.5 toward the nucleus .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that the non - detection of [ nev ] emission in these sources is the result of obscuration ( along our line of sight ) of the interior , most highly ionized part of the outflow rather than the absence or insignificance of an agn in these sources . for the fourth galaxy , iras010032238 ,",
    "conflicting classifications exist .",
    "several studies have concluded that this galaxy may be starburst - powered @xcite , whereas @xcite classify this galaxy as seyfert - ii and @xcite refer to it as a qso .",
    "its spitzer - irs spectrum is continuum - dominated ( class 1a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a 6.2@xmath3 m pah equivalent width more than ten times lower than for starburst galaxies . from the pah luminosity",
    "we calculate a contribution of the starburst to the infrared luminosity of 1020% @xcite .",
    "this would imply that iras010032238 is agn - dominatedm [ nev ] line and of the near - infrared agn tracer 1.962@xmath3 m [ sivi ] @xcite is not exceptional among agn - dominated ulirgs .",
    "other examples are mrk231 @xcite and iras002752859 ] and its outflow likely agn - powered .",
    "the mere detection of blue wings in [ neii ] and [ neiii ] line profiles in spitzer - irs - sh galaxy spectra may hence be a general signpost of agn activity .",
