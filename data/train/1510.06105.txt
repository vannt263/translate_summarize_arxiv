    "<S> a new mechanism for geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) excitation by a not fully slowed down energetic particle ( ep ) beam is analysed to explain experimental observations in large helical device . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the positive velocity space gradient near the lower - energy end of the ep distribution function can strongly drive gam unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the new features of this ep - induced gam ( egam ) are : 1 . no instability threshold in the pitch angle ; 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the egam frequency can be higher than the local gam frequency ; and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the instability growth rate is much larger than that driven by a fully slowed down ep beam .    </S>",
    "<S> geodesic acoustic modes ( gam ) @xcite are finite frequency components of zonal structures ( zs ) , with a predominantly @xmath0 scalar potential and @xmath1 up - down asymmetric density perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> gams have been intensively studied in the past two decades due to their potential roles in regulating symmetry - breaking microscopic turbulence @xcite and the associated wave - induced transport . </S>",
    "<S> further to this wave - wave couplings , resonant wave - particle interactions with energetic particles ( ep ) , i.e. , the so called energetic - particle - induced gam ( egam ) , also attracted significant attention @xcite . due to their  zonal \" mode structures </S>",
    "<S> , gam can not be excited by expansion free energy associated with pressure gradients , and velocity space anisotropy is needed for egam instability . in previous works , </S>",
    "<S> a slowing - down ep distribution with a localized pitch angle @xcite was adopted to study the egam excitation by neutral beam injection ( nbi ) , considering that ep slowing down due to collisions with electrons is much faster than pitch angle scattering due to ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , for the fully slowed down eps , only eps with pitch angle @xmath2 are destabilizing @xcite , as later confirmed by numerical simulation @xcite . here , @xmath3 is the pitch angle , @xmath4 is the magentic moment , @xmath5 is the magnetic field at magnetic axis and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> berk and zhou @xcite , meanwhile , proposed that the sharp gradient in pitch angle induced by nbi prompt loss could lead to fast excitation of egam . </S>",
    "<S> gam excitation by a bump - on - tail ion distribution function is addressed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> , for the case where ep source is the high - energy tail in ion distribution function induced by radial frequency ( rf ) heating ; and possible interaction between egam and drift wave turbulence is discussed @xcite .    a recent paper by ido et al @xcite presented experimental evidences in the large helical device ( lhd ) , where egam is observed during tangential neutral beam injection , and some peculiarities appears in the comparison with theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the egam is excited before the injected nbi is fully slowed down , and the ep birth energy ( @xmath7 ) is much larger than that predicted for wave - particle resonance @xcite ; thus , earlier theories based on a fully slowed down nbi @xcite can not be directly applied here . in this work , we explain why egam is excited by a not fully slowed down ep beam , with the ep distribution function being a function of time . as we will show later , the instability drive comes from the positive velocity space gradient in the low - energy end of the ep distribution function , similar to that of a bump - on - tail distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the egam excited by such an ep beam can be applied to explain the experimental observations in lhd @xcite . for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we focus only on the local dispersion relation of egam , while neglecting system nonuniformity and higher order effects , such as finite larmor radius . </S>",
    "<S> modulation of ep distribution function due to excitation of egam is not taken into account either .    </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation of the @xmath8 electrostatic egam can be derived from quasi - neutrality condition , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the nonadiabatic component of the perturbed particle distribution function @xmath11 and @xmath10 is derived from linear gyrokinetic equation@xcite @xmath12 here , the subscripts @xmath13 representing electrons , ions and eps , respectively ; and @xmath14 is the electric charge . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath15 is bessel function of the zero - index , with @xmath16 being the larmor radius , @xmath17 is the transit frequency , @xmath18 is the magnetic drift frequency ; and other notations are standard .    the thermal plasma response to gam has already been derived in several earlier works , and we shall not provide the details here . </S>",
    "<S> ep response can be derived by transforming into drift orbit center coordinates . since , </S>",
    "<S> in the scenario considered here , egam is excited before the eps are fully slowed down , we assume the following distribution for eps : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is related with nbi flux and slowing - down time , @xmath21 is the heaviside step function , @xmath22 is the ep birth energy , @xmath23 is the lower end of the distribution function , @xmath24 is the slowing - down rate , and we typically have @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming small ep drift orbit normalized to egam wave length and keeping only @xmath26 transit harmonics , one then obtains the following dispersion relation from the surface averaged quasi - neutrality condition @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gam frequency , @xmath29 and the perturbed ep density @xmath30    the dispersion relation can then be derived as @xmath31=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transit frequency defined at @xmath22 and @xmath36 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath35 is a slowly varying function of @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that there are two different singularities in the dispersion relation ; i.e. , the logarithmic terms ( the first ones in the square bracket ) typical of a slowing down distribution , and the simple poles ( the second ones in the square bracket ) from the integration limits . as noted in ref . , the simple pole at @xmath38 only modulate theegam real frequency , but it does not contribute to mode excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic terms , on the other hand , are destabilizing for @xmath39 ; thus , there is a threshold , @xmath39 , for egam excitation by the fully slowed down ep beam case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , for the not fully slowed down distribution function considered here , the simple pole at @xmath40 is also destabilizing ; thus , there is no threshold in the pitch angle @xmath41 for egam excitation by the eps .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    , width=340 ]    the dispersion relation can be solved numerically as a function of @xmath42 , and yield the slow temporal evolution of the excited egam due to the slowing down of the ep beam . </S>",
    "<S> there are three branches ; a gam branch with @xmath43 , a lower beam branch ( lbb ) with @xmath44 ; and an upper beam branch(ubb ) , with @xmath45 . here , we take @xmath46 with the imaginary part being the landau damping rate of gam , @xmath47 , and @xmath39 such that the coefficient of the logarithmic term ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) is positive . </S>",
    "<S> the real frequency and growth rate are shown , respectively , in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rf_lpa ] and [ fig : gr_lpa ] . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axis is time in unites of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we may see that , only lbb with the frequency @xmath50 can be unstable , consistent with the fact that , in the present case of experimental interest for lhd experimental observations @xcite , the ubb frequency is larger than the gam frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lbb is stable when @xmath51 ; as @xmath35 approaches @xmath28 with @xmath37 , the growth rate of lbb will increase significantly ( @xmath52 ) , and then decays quickly as @xmath36 further decreases ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> later on ( @xmath54 ) , the growth rate decays very slowly , due to the contribution of the destabilizing logarithmic term . </S>",
    "<S> so for @xmath39 , the mode can be interpreted as a double - beam plasma instability with the two singularities dominating at different times . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath35 approaches @xmath28 , the simple pole dominates ; however , as @xmath35 further decreases and becomes smaller than @xmath28 by a finite amount , the contribution from the simple pole is negligible , while the logarithmic term still contributes to destabilizing the egam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strong instability at @xmath55 may also provide an explanation for the fast growth of egam observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we note also that , the frequency of the unstable lbb , can be significantly larger than @xmath28 , as is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : rf_lpa ] . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the higher - frequency branch of egam observed in lhd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another evidence of that the present theory can be applied to explain the lhd experiment is that , in the discharges with electron cyclotron resonance heating ( ech ) , the dependence of the observed egam frequency on plasma temperature is weaker . </S>",
    "<S> this is because that the slowing down rate is lower in the ech discharges , where collisional rate is lower due to higher electron temperature , such that the unstable mode is more a  beam - branch \" with the frequency determined by the transit frequency of eps @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    , width=340 ]    the real frequency and growth rate for @xmath56 are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rf_spa ] and [ fig : gr_spa ] , respectively . in this case , the logarithmic term is stabilizing @xcite ; thus , the egam discussed here is similar to beam - plasma instability , which , however , has a double pole instead of the simple pole of the present case . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that , the behaviors of the three branches are similar to the case with @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath35 becomes smaller than @xmath28 by a finite amount , the growth rate of lbb decreases to zero as the contribution of the simple pole becomes vanishingly small , similar to that of a beam - plasma instability . </S>",
    "<S> but it is clearly shown that , due to the contribution from the positive gradient in the lower - energy end of the distribution function , egam can still be driven unstable here , unlike the case of the fully slowed - down ep beam .    in conclusion , we elucidate the mechanism for gam excitation by a not fully slowed down ep beam , which can be applied to explain the experimental observations in large helical device . </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of singularities in the dispersion relation ; one is the logarithmic singularity typical of a slowing - down distribution function ; and the other one is simple pole from the low- and high - energy end of the distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that only the lower beam branch with the frequency determined by the low - energy limit of the distribution function is unstable , consistent with the fact that the upper beam branch frequency is larger than the gam frequency as in the case of experimental interest . for @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> both singularities are destabilizing , with the simple pole dominating as @xmath57 ; and the contribution of the logarithmic singularity taking over as @xmath35 becomes much smaller than @xmath28 . on the other hand , for @xmath56 , only the simple pole is destabilizing , and the behavior of egam is very similar to a beam - plasma instability . in both cases , the real frequency of the unstable lower beam branch can be significantly higher than gam frequency , providing an explanation for experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> note that the real frequency of the unstable lower beam branch can be higher than local gam frequency does nt conflict with the argument we used to explain why the upper beam branch is always stable , since the simple pole at @xmath58 is always stabilizing , so one needs the unstable branch to have a frequency lower than local gam frequency for the instability of the logarithmic term ; while the lower beam branch is unstable at @xmath59 due to the contribution of the simple pole . </S>",
    "<S> another novel result of this work is that , the egam drive is much stronger than that predicted in earlier theories @xcite , since the destabilizing simple pole singularity obtained in the present case is much stronger than the logarithmic singularity from a fully slowed down ep distribution function . </S>"
