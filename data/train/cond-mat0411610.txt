    "stochastic processes with an absorbing state arise frequently in statistical physics @xcite , epidemiology @xcite and related fields .",
    "phase transitions to an absorbing state in spatially extended systems , exemplified by the contact process @xcite , are currently of great interest in connection with self - organized criticality @xcite , the transition to turbulence @xcite , and issues of universality in nonequilibrium critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the _ quasi - stationary _ ( qs ) distribution , ( that is , conditioned on survival ) , is very useful in the study of processes with an absorbing state model .",
    "conventional simulations of  stationary \" properties of lattice models with an absorbing state actually study the quasi - stationary regime , given that the only true stationary state for a finite system is the absorbing one .",
    "we recently devised a simulation method that yields quasi - stationary properties directly @xcite ; it samples the qs probability distribution just as conventional monte carlo simulation samples the equilibrium distribution .",
    "here we use the method to study the static correlation function and other configurational properties of the critical contact process , the prime example of an absorbing - state phase transition .    in the following section we review the basis of our method . then in sec .",
    "iii we apply it to determine the static two - point correlation function of the contact process on a ring .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "consider a continuous - time markov process @xmath2 taking values @xmath3 , with state @xmath4 absorbing .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote the probability that @xmath6 , given some initial state @xmath7 .",
    "the survival probability is @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose that as @xmath9 the @xmath10 , normalized by the survival probability @xmath11 , attain a time - independent form , thus defining the quasi - stationary distribution @xmath12 :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 .",
    "( we further assume that the limiting distribution does not depend on the initial state , as long as @xmath15.)the qs distribution is normalized so : @xmath16    as shown in @xcite , the qs distribution is the stationary solution to the following equation of motion ( for @xmath17 )    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the total rate of transitions out of state @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the flux of probability into this state . to see this ,",
    "consider the master equation ( eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) without the final term ) in the qs regime . substituting @xmath22 , and noting that in the qs regime @xmath23 , we see that the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) is identically zero if @xmath24 for @xmath25 . the final term in eq . ( [ qme ] )",
    "represents a redistribution of the probability @xmath26 ( transfered to the absorbing state in the original master equation ) , to the nonabsorbing subspace .",
    "each nonabsorbing state receives a share equal to its qs probability .    in @xcite",
    "we introduce a process @xmath27 , whose _ stationary _ probability distribution is the _ quasi - stationary _ distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "( note that in order to have a nontrivial stationary distribution , @xmath27 can not possess an absorbing state . )",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath27 is governed by eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) , which implies that for @xmath28 ( i.e. , away from the absorbing state ) , the evolution of @xmath27 is identical to that of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 enters the absorbing state , however , @xmath27 instead jumps to a nonabsorbing one , and then resumes its  usual \" evolution ( with the same transition probabilities as @xmath2 ) , until such time as another visit to the absorbing state is imminent .    in eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) the distribution @xmath29 is used to determine the value of @xmath27 when @xmath2 visits the absorbing state .",
    "although one has no prior knowledge of @xmath29 ( or its long - time limit , the qs distribution @xmath12 ) , one can , in a simulation , use the history @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) up to time @xmath32 , to _ estimate _ the @xmath29 .",
    "this is done by saving a sample @xmath33 of configurations visited .",
    "we update the sample by replacing from time to time one of the configurations with the current one . in this way the distribution for the process @xmath27 will converge to the qs distribution ( i.e. , the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) ) at long times .",
    "summarizing , the process @xmath27 has the same dynamics as @xmath2 , except when a transition to the absorbing state is imminent : @xmath27 then is placed in a nonabsorbing state , selected at random from a sample over the history of the realization .",
    "( in the simulation , a list of @xmath34 configurations is maintained .",
    "whenever the time increases by 1 , the list is updated with probability @xmath35 , by replacing a randomly chosen configuration on the list with the current one . ) in effect , the final term in eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) is represented as a _",
    "memory _ in the simulation .",
    "the above scheme was shown @xcite to yield precise results , in accord with the exact qs distribution for the contact process on a complete graph @xcite , and with conventional simulations of the same model on a ring , for which exact results are not available .",
    "qs simulation results were found rather insensitive to the choice of list size @xmath34 and replacement rate @xmath35 . in the studies reported below we use @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) @xcite is a continuous - time markov process on a lattice , in which each site @xmath38 is either occupied ( @xmath39 ) , or vacant ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "transitions from @xmath41 to @xmath42 occur at a rate of unity , independent of the neighboring sites .",
    "the reverse transition can only occur if at least one neighbor is occupied : the transition from @xmath42 to @xmath41 occurs at rate @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the fraction of nearest neighbors of site @xmath38 that are occupied ; thus the state @xmath42 for all @xmath38 is absorbing .",
    "( @xmath45 is a control parameter governing the rate of spread of activity . )",
    "the order parameter @xmath46 is the fraction of occupied sites .",
    "the model exhibits a continuous phase transition at @xmath47 @xcite . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the stationary value of @xmath49 is zero .",
    "the cp has attracted much interest as a prototype of a nonequilibrium critical point , a simple representative of the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . since its scaling properties have been discussed extensively @xcite we review them only briefly .",
    "as the critical point is approached , the correlation length @xmath50 and correlation time @xmath51 diverge , following @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the distance from the critical point .",
    "the order parameter scales as @xmath55 for @xmath56 . at the critical point",
    "the quasi - stationary value of the order parameter scales as : @xmath57 .",
    "an aspect of the cp that has not , to our knowledge , been studied in simulations is the static correlation function .",
    "of particular interest is how correlations decay at the critical point .",
    "the correlation function is defined via @xmath58 where the average is over the stationary distribution of the process .",
    "based on experience with equilibrium critical phenomena , we expect @xmath59 to decay as a power law at the critical point .",
    "the decay exponent can be determined via a scaling argument . to begin",
    ", we normalize @xmath59 to its value at @xmath60 : @xmath61 now consider the scaled variance @xmath62 ( @xmath63 denotes the lattice size . ) at the critical point , @xmath64 with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath66 where in the last step we used translation invariance , and assumed a hypercubic lattice of @xmath67 sites .",
    "now suppose @xmath68 for large @xmath44 .",
    "approximating the sum by an integral , and recalling that @xmath69 at the critical point , we find @xmath70 implying that @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the critical stationary state .",
    "the relation @xmath71 was demonstrated some time ago by grassberger and de la torre , who showed that @xmath73 at the critical point @xcite .",
    "( their result is seen to be equivalent to ours when we recall the scaling relations @xmath74 and @xmath75 . )",
    "we use the qs simulation method outlined above to determine the correlation function .",
    "the process is simulated in five independent realizations of @xmath76 time steps . as is usual ,",
    "annihilation events are chosen with probability @xmath77 and creation with probability @xmath78 .",
    "a site is chosen from a list of currently occupied sites , and , in the case of annihilation , is vacated , while , for creation events , a nearest - neighbor site is selected at random and , if it is currently vacant , it becomes occupied .",
    "the time increment associated with each event is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the number of occupied sites just prior to the attempted transition @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath81 for @xmath82 and 2560 , using the best available estimate ( from series analysis ) , @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the data collapse for the two lattice sizes is nearly perfect . for @xmath84 the correlation function",
    "indeed follows a power law @xmath85 , while for @xmath86 it attains a minimum , as expected due to the periodic boundaries . to determine the decay exponent we analyze the local slope @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , obtained from a linear fit to the data for @xmath88 versus @xmath89 , using points equally spaced in @xmath89 , in finite intervals @xmath90 $ ] . for @xmath91 the local slope is nearly constant , but it of course veers upward as @xmath26 approaches @xmath92 .",
    "we therefore perform an extrapolation ( to @xmath93 ) of the local slope versus @xmath94 , using only the data on which the results for the two lattice sizes agree , to eliminate finite - size effects .",
    "the result of this extrapolation is @xmath95 , consistent with the best estimate .    for @xmath48 ,",
    "the correlation function decays exponentially , @xmath96 .",
    "this is evident in the inset of fig .",
    "1 , where we plot @xmath97 .",
    "exponential decay is clear for @xmath98 ; linear regression yields @xmath99 in this case , well below the system size ( @xmath100 ) in this study .",
    "interestingly , the decay of @xmath101 is also perceptible for @xmath102 , though partly masked due to the finite system size . in general the decay of correlations should be evident for @xmath103 , where @xmath50 is the correlation length in the infinite - size limit .",
    "since @xmath104 , deviations from criticality on the order of @xmath105 ( or greater ) should be detectable in the correlation function for a system of size @xmath63 .    in the critical stationary state ,",
    "the distribution of particles is scale - invariant , as reflected in the power - law decay of @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution of _ gaps _ , or strings of empty sites between successive occupied sites also follows a power law .",
    "( a gap of size @xmath106 corresponds to sites @xmath38 and @xmath107 occupied and all intervening sites empty . )",
    "we determine the gap - size distribution @xmath108 ( normalized to the number of gaps in the configuration ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath108 exhibits a power law decay , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , over an intermediate range that appears to grow with system size .",
    "analysis of the local slope yields @xmath111 .",
    "we can relate the exponent @xmath51 to other critical exponents via a simple scaling argument .",
    "since there is one gap per particle , the mean gap size @xmath112 is just the reciprocal of the particle density .",
    "thus in a system of size @xmath63 at the critical point , @xmath113 .",
    "assuming @xmath114 for @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 implying @xmath117 . our simulation result is about 1% smaller than the value predicted by the scaling argument .",
    "the discrepancy is likely caused by finite - size corrections that limit the power - law regime of @xmath108 .    finally , we report preliminary results on a surprising behavior of the interparticle distance in the two - particle subspace .",
    "let @xmath118 denote the separation between the occupied sites , given that that exactly two sites are occupied .",
    "( we take the minimum distance under periodic boundaries , so that @xmath119 . ) since particles are highly clustered in the critical cp , we should expect the two - particle distance distribution @xmath120 to decay with separation .",
    "our results ( see fig .",
    "4 ) from qs simulations at the critical point suggest a power - law decay , @xmath121 , with @xmath122 .",
    "we have no way of relating this exponent to the known critical exponents .",
    "indeed , whether @xmath120 follows a power - law will have to be confirmed in larger - scale simulations .",
    "this is somewhat challenging since , as the system size increases , the probability of having exactly two particles becomes ever smaller .",
    "we have applied a new simulation method for quasi - stationary properties to determine the static correlation function @xmath59 of the critical contact process in one dimension .",
    "our results support the behavior @xmath123 anticipated from scaling arguments .",
    "we also studied the gap - size distribution , which shows evidence of a power - law decay , @xmath114 , with @xmath124 , the value predicted by scaling .",
    "finally we note an apparent scale - invariant behavior of the interparticle distance distribution @xmath120 in the two - particle subspace .",
    "study of the correlation function and the gap - size distribution promise to be useful in characterizing scaling behavior of new models , and may also be useful in locating the critical point .",
