    "the notion of energy in the radiation regime ( in our paper referred to as the trautman - bondi energy ) has been introduced in einstein s theory of gravity by trautman @xcite and independently by bondi @xcite .",
    "it measures that part of the gravitational energy of an isolated system , which `` has not yet been radiated '' . in conformal spacetime compactification",
    ", the trautman - bondi energy may be assigned to any space - like hypersurface having a regular intersection with the conformal boundary @xmath0 ( null infinity , or the _ scri _ ) @xcite . due to radiation , the trautman - bondi energy  unlike the total ( adm ) energy  is not conserved , but is _ decreasing _ because it may be partially radiated in a form of gravitational waves .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the validity of the trautman - bondi energy goes far beyond the gravitational context and may be used in any hyperbolic field theory , also special - relativistic one . in particular , it has a beautiful hamiltonian interpretation .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to apply this idea to the scalar field theory , where the cauchy data of the system are assigned to a hyperboloid",
    ". field evolution on hyperboloids is proved to be a hamiltonian system , if we complete cauchy data by the _ radiation data _ at the _ scri _ , and supplement the trautman - bondi energy with the corresponding _",
    "radiation energy_. the sum of the two defines the total hamiltonian function of the `` matter + radiation '' system . but",
    "to `` tailor '' the two disjoint objects : 1 ) the field cauchy data on a hyperboloid and 2 ) the radiation data on the _ scri _ , into a single object , appropriate compatibly conditions ( often called `` corner conditions '' @xcite ) must be imposed .",
    "we propose a universal approach which solves all these issues .",
    "hamiltonian description of any field dynamics is based on a `` 3 + 1 '' foliation of spacetime .",
    "leaves of the foliation are labeled by a parameter called the `` time variable '' .",
    "phase space of this dynamics is composed of all the possible field cauchy data on a given leaf . the `` 3 + 1 '' decomposition provides also an identification between different leaves of the foliation , which makes the field dynamics and its hamiltonian function uniquely defined . here , we consider the hamiltonian description within a simple model : the massless scalar field , satisfying the wave equation in two- or four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "this means that the space is one - dimensional : @xmath1 or three - dimensional : @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to the standard ( `` adm '' ) formulation , the field initial data will not be assigned to spatially flat cauchy surfaces , but to hypersurfaces which extend to null infinity , namely spacelike hyperboloids .",
    "naively , such a cauchy problem can not be described as a hamiltonian system : future evolution of the system is well defined , but the past evolution is absolutely non - unique and may be arbitrarily modified by radiation .",
    "nevertheless , we are going to show , that the hamiltonian formulation of the field evolution is possible .",
    "for this purpose we have to complete cauchy data on a hyperboloid by appropriate _ radiation data _ at light infinity .    for pedagogical reasons ,",
    "we begin our analysis with a ( much simpler ) finite case , where we restrict field dynamics to a finite light - cone and describe initial data on its ( characteristic ! ) boundary and on the finite part of the hyperboloid , contained within the cone . at the end",
    ", we may consider the limiting case ( in our notation , this corresponds to @xmath3 ) , where the finite cone is shifted to infinity .",
    "this way we obtain the hamiltonian description of initial data on the entire hyperboloid and on the _ scri _ @xmath4 ( conformal boundary of the spacetime ) . in the subsequent section",
    "we describe the two - dimensional `` toy model '' .",
    "the complete , four - dimensional theory is analyzed in section [ sec:13case ] .",
    "let us consider a one - parameter family of past oriented light cones in the two - dimensional minkowski space time : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time coordinate of the vertex of @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce new coordinates @xmath8 connected with minkowski coordinates @xmath9 in the following way : @xmath10 where @xmath11 . for @xmath12 new coordinates parameterize the whole cone @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , surfaces @xmath13 const.@xmath14 correspond to hyperboloids . in order to describe field dynamics in a hamiltonian way",
    ", we begin with the standard , relativistic lagrangian for wave equation : @xmath15 expressing the lagrangian density `` @xmath16 '' in new coordinates we obtain : @xmath17 where @xmath18    \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial\\xi}\\right)^2\\ , .\\ ] ] denoting @xmath19\\ ] ] we obtain the autonomous ( i.e. @xmath20-independent ) lagrangian function : @xmath21    now , the standard procedure leading from the lagrangian to the hamiltonian description may be applied .",

    "this apparent paradox is implied by the fact , that evolution of cauchy data on a hyperboloid is well defined only forward in time and , whence , does not correspond _ a priori _ to any hamiltonian system . to overcome this difficulty , we take into account missing data on the light cone below hyperboloid and treat it as a part of cauchy data ( cf .",
