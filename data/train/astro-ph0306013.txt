    "neutrinos have fascinated people ever since they were first introduced by wolfgang pauli in 1931 . since then , neutrinos have gone from hypothetical to an extremely promising tool for analysing astrophysical events , and neutrino cosmology is now one of the hottest topics in modern time due to the discovery that neutrinos may be massive @xcite . because of its weak interaction with other particles , neutrinos can travel great distances without being affected appreciably by material obstacles .",
    "they can therefore give us detailed information about events taking place deep within , e.g. supernov .",
    "furthermore , since the neutrinos decoupled from matter at a redshift @xmath0 of the order @xmath1 , as compared to @xmath2 for photons , it is possible that neutrinos could give us a detailed understanding of the early universe , if such a signal could be detected @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos have also been a possible candidate for hot dark matter necessary for explaining certain cosmological observations , such as rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , massive neutrinos could have a profound influence on the evolution of our universe .",
    "unfortunately , due to the tremaine ",
    "gunn bound @xcite , the necessary mass of the missing particles ( if fermions ) for explaining the formation of dwarf galaxies seems to make neutrinos of _ any _ species unlikely single candidates for dark matter . as a remedy to this problem , interacting hot dark matter has been suggested @xcite , since the interaction prevents the free - streaming smoothing of small scale neutrino inhomogeneities .",
    "thus , dark matter in astrophysics is not only a mystery but it also plays an essential role in determining the dynamics of the universe , its large scale structures , the galaxies and superclusters .",
    "however , so far , the suggested `` sticky '' neutrino models have not been successful in dealing with the dwarf galaxy problem @xcite .    a first successful indication that neutrinos have a non - zero mass came in 1998 through laboratory experiments of atmospheric neutrinos and their oscillations @xcite .",
    "although the allowed neutrino masses encompass a wide range , it is currently believed that neutrinos have masses below 2  ev .",
    "this conclusion is furthermore supported by independent cosmological observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the masses of neutrinos are indeed very small , and the classical analysis by tremaine and gunn would thereby indicate that neutrinos can in no way be considered as a sole candidate for dark matter .",
    "this conclusion will in this paper be re - analyzed within the electro - weak framework , where neutrino  neutrino interactions occur as a natural consequence of the theory .",
    "thus , in this letter , we consider the nonlinear interaction between neutrinos and antineutrinos in the lepton plasma of the early universe , adopting a semi - classical model .",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos interact with dense plasmas through the charged and neutral weak currents arising from the fermi weak nuclear interaction forces .",
    "charged weak currents involve the exchange of the charged vector bosons associated with the processes involving interactions between leptons and neutrinos of the same flavor , while neutrino weak currents involve the exchange of the neutral vector bosons associated with processes involving neutrinos of all types interacting with arbitrary charged and neutral particles .",
    "asymmetric flows of neutrinos and antineutrinos in the early universe plasma may be created by the ponderomotive force of nonuniform intense photon beams or by shock waves . here , using an effective field theory approach , a system of coupled wigner - moyal equations for nonlinearly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos is derived , and it is shown that these equations admit a modulational instability . finally , we discuss the relevance of our results in the context of the dark matter problem , and it is moreover suggested that the nonlinearly excited fluctuations could be used as a starting point for obtaining a better understanding of the process of galaxy formation .",
    "it turns out that the short - time evolution of the primordial neutrino plasma medium in the temperature range @xmath3 is governed by collisionless collective effects involving relativistic neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "as a primer , we will study the implication of the known dispersion of neutrinos on a thermal neutrino / anti - neutrino background , using the eikonal representation and the wkbj approximation .",
    "suppose that a single neutrino ( or anti - neutrino ) moves in a fermionic sea composed of neutrino  antineutrino admixture .",
    "the energy @xmath4 of the neutrino ( antineutrino ) is then given by ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) momentum , @xmath7 the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath8 the neutrino mass .",
    "the effective potential for a neutrino moving on a background of it s own flavor and in thermal equilibrium is given by @xcite ( see also @xcite )    @xmath9    while the potential for a neutrino moving on a background of a different flavor is @xmath10 [ potential ]    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the fermi constant , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the density of the background neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) represents the propagating neutrino ( antineutrino )",
    ". expressions ( [ potential ] ) are valid in the rest frame of the background . as seen from ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) , while neutrinos moving in a background of neutrinos and antineutrinos change their energy by an amount @xmath17 , the antineutrinos change their energy by @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath19 in ( [ potential1 ] ) as compared to expression ( [ potential2 ] ) comes from exchange effects between identical particles @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ energy ] ) can be interpreted as a dispersion relation for relativistic and nonrelativistic neutrinos , with the identifications @xmath20 and @xmath21 , i. e. @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the planck constant divided by @xmath24 . by using the eikonal representation ( viz .",

    "( [ maineq ] ) thus yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",

    "( [ maineq ] ) can finally be written as the coupled system @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for neutrinos moving on the same flavor background .",
    "equation ( [ interaction ] ) shows that this approach can lead to some interesting effects .",
    "the case of a single self - interacting neutrino bunch shows that the formation of dark solitary structures is possible . furthermore , the slightly more complicated case of two interacting bunches , either of the neutrino  neutrino or neutrino  anti - neutrino type , can result in splitting and focusing of the wave packets @xcite .",
    "in the preceding section , we investigated the case of a neutrino bunch close to thermal equilibrium . in general , this may of course not be the case , and eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) must be modified .",

    "the distribution functions are defined to be normalized such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the number density of the @xmath52 neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) bunch .",
    "the first thing to notice is that when the distribution is thermal , the potential ( [ fullpotential ] ) reduces exactly to ( [ potential1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , when the neutrinos have an almost thermal distribution , i.e. the corresponding distribution function may be expressed as ( dropping the indices for notational simplicity ) @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , we obtain the following form of the potential @xmath55 .\\ ] ] the last term is small and may therefore be neglected , and we obtain @xmath56 , in accordance with expressions ( [ potential1 ] ) , thus justifying the equation of motion ( [ interaction ] ) .",
    "now , we define a distribution function for the neutrino states by fourier transforming the two - point correlation function for @xmath57 , according to @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath6 represents the momentum of the neutrino ( antineutrino ) quasi - particles ( note that the ensemble average was not present in the original definition @xcite , but has important consequences when the phase of the wave function has a random component @xcite ; for similar treatments of optical beams and quantum plasmas , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we note that with the definition ( [ statdef ] ) , the following relation holds @xmath59 thus , using ( [ statdef ] ) and ( [ modnlse ] ) together with the potential ( [ fullpotential ] ) we obtain the generalized wigner  moyal equation @xmath60{f}_{i\\pm }   = 0 ,    \\label{wigner}\\ ] ] for @xmath61 , where the @xmath62-operator is defined in terms of its taylor expansion , and the arrows denote the direction of operation . in the case of the potential ( [ potential1 ] ) , the last term in",
