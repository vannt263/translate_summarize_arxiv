    "although the existence of dark matter as a major portion of the matter in the universe has been well supported by various astronomical observations , its identity is unknown yet . weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp )",
    "is regarded as one of the strongest candidates for cold dark matter particle  @xcite and many experimental searches for wimps have been performed .",
    "an indication of an annual modulation of the signal reported by dama using crystal detectors may be a possible evidence of wimp signal  @xcite .",
    "however , stringent limits set by cryogenic detectors , cdms  @xcite and edelweiss  @xcite seem to rule out the dama signal region .",
    "still , ways of interpreting both results without conflict are not completely excluded because of the difference in experimental techniques and target nuclei  @xcite .    the korea invisible mass search  ( kims ) collaboration has been carrying out the wimp search with crystals .",
    "low threshold suitability for wimp search and pulse shape discrimination  ( psd ) superiority to has been demonstrated  @xcite . even if the crystal has the advantage of a good psd and the ease of getting a large detector mass , the internal background including , and , has been a major hurdle to apply the crystal to wimp search  @xcite .",
    "we have successfully purified crystals after extensive studies on the contamination mechanism . a pilot experiment with a low background crystal of 6.6",
    "kg mass has been carried out at the yangyang underground laboratory  ( y2l ) in korea .",
    "we report the first result obtained with 237  kg@xmath0days of data taken with one crystal of 8  x  8  x  23  @xmath1 .",
    "we have established an underground laboratory at yangyang utilizing the space provided by the yangyang pumped storage power plant currently under construction by korea midland power co. the underground laboratory is located in a tunnel where the vertical earth overburden is approximately 700  m. the muon flux measured with the muon detector is @xmath2 , which is consistent with the water equivalent depth of 2000  m  @xcite .",
    "the laboratory is equipped with a clean room with an air conditioning system for a constant temperature and low humidity .",
    "an environment monitoring system is installed for continuous monitoring of temperature and humidity .",
    "the temperature inside the detector container is stable within @xmath3  0.2  @xmath4c .",
    "the rock composition surrounding the laboratory was analyzed with the icp - mass method and the contamination of @xmath5u and @xmath6th is reported to be at a level of @xmath7  0.5  ppm and 5.6  @xmath3  2.6  ppm respectively .",
    "the relatively low contamination of @xmath5u in the rocks of the tunnel results in a low level of radon contamination in the air of the tunnel .",
    "a radon detector  @xcite was constructed to monitor the level of radon in the experimental hall .",
    "the contamination level of @xmath8rn in the tunnel air was 1 - 2  pci/@xmath9 which is slightly lower than other underground laboratories such as gran sasso  @xcite and kamiokande  @xcite .",
    "the neutron flux in the experimental hall is continuously measured with two one - liter bc501a liquid scintillation detectors inside and outside of the main shield .",
    "the estimated neutron flux in the experimental hall is @xmath10 for 1.5  mev  @xmath11  6.0  mev which is much lower than that in the cheongpyung underground laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the major radioisotopes in the crystal contributing to the internal background are @xmath12cs , @xmath13cs and @xmath14rb  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13cs has a half - life of 2  years and has a cosmogenic origin - neutron capture by @xmath15cs .",
    "therefore , @xmath13cs is unavoidable unless the crystals are stored underground for many years .",
    "however the signal from its decay can be easily removed by the @xmath16-ray that follows immediately after the @xmath17 decay .",
    "the signal is large and beyond the energy range of our interest for wimp search .",
    "additional reduction can be made by using coincidence signals from neighboring crystals .",
    "the average contamination level of @xmath13cs is measured to be 20  mbq / kg , while 1  mbq / kg can contribute only less than 0.07  counts/(kev@xmath0kg@xmath0day )  ( cpd ) at 10kev .",
    "therefore the @xmath13cs contamination is not a major problem .",
    "@xmath12cs , the half - life of which is 30  years , comes from a man - made origin , mainly due to nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors .",
    "it decays to an excited state of @xmath12ba by emitting an electron with a q value of 514  kev , followed by @xmath16-ray emission to the ground state @xmath12ba with a half - life of 2.55  minutes .",
    "therefore the compton scattering of this @xmath16-ray as well as the @xmath17-ray can cause background in the low energy range where wimp signals are expected .",
    "simulation studies show that 1  mbq / kg can contribute 0.35  cpd background in the 10  kev region .",
    "we investigated the contamination process and the reduction method of @xmath12cs .",
    "most of the suspected intermediate products from pollucite , an ore of cs , to csi powder has been measured with a low background hpge detector installed at the y2l .",
    "we also investigated the processing water and conclude that the main source of @xmath12cs is the processing water used for the powder production , in which the contamination level of @xmath12cs was found to be 0.1  mbq/@xmath9 . by using purified water , we succeeded in reducing the @xmath12cs in the final powder and the crystal  @xcite .",
    "rb , which includes 27.8% of @xmath14rb , exists in the pollucite at a 0.7% level and can contaminate easily because it is chemically similar to cs .",
    "the @xmath14rb undergoes @xmath17 decay to the ground state of its daughter nucleus , @xmath14sr , with emission of an electron whose end point energy is 282  kev",
    ". this can be a very serious background , and 1  ppb contamination can contribute 1.07  cpd at 10kev .",
    "contamination of many csi powders in the market has been measured with the icp - mass method and we found that it varies from 1  ppb to 1000  ppb .",
    "the reduction technique of rb , a repeated recrystallization process , has been widely known .",
    "we performed the recrystallization to the powder that we obtained with pure water and reduced the rb contamination below 1  ppb .",
    "the reduction of the internal background is discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have installed a shielding structure in the experimental hall to stop the external background originating mainly from the surrounding rocks .",
    "the shield consists of 10  cm thick oxygen free high conductivity  ( ofhc ) copper , 5  cm thick polyethylene  ( pe ) , 15  cm thick boliden lead and 30  cm mineral oil  ( liquid parafin ) from inside out .",
    "the mineral oil is mixed with 5% of a pseudocumene - based liquid scintillator and mounted with pmts so that it can perform as a muon detector  @xcite .",
    "inside the copper chamber , n@xmath18 gas is flown at a rate of 4  @xmath9/min to reduce the radon contamination as well as to keep the humidity low .",
    "the crystal  ( full - size crystal ) used for the experiment has a dimension of 8  x  8  x  23  @xmath1 and a mass of 6.6  kg .",
    "the crystal is attached with two low background quartz window pmts with rbcs photocathode .",
    "rbcs photocathode enhances quantum efficiency in the green wavelength region and gives 50% more photoelectron yield for crystal than a normal bialkali pmt does . as a result ,",
    "the number of photoelectrons is about 5.5/kev for the full - size crystal .",
    "the signal from the pmt is amplified with a preamplifier mounted outside the main shield and brought to the fadc module through a 20  m - long coaxial cable .",
    "the homemade fadc module is designed to sample the pulse every 2  ns for a duration up to 32  @xmath19s so that one can fully reconstruct each photoelectron pulse as shown in fig .",
    "[ low_pulse ] .",
    "the trigger is formed in the fpga chip on the fadc board . for low energy events",
    ", it is required to have more than five photoelectrons in two  @xmath19s for the event trigger .",
    "an additional trigger is generated if the width of the pulse is longer than 200  ns for high energy events where many single photon signals are merged into a big pulse .",
    "the fadc located in a vme crate is read out by a linux - operating pc through the vme - usb2 interface with a maximum data transfer rate of 10  mbytes / s .",
    "the daq system is based on the root  @xcite package .    during the two - month period starting from july 2004 ,",
    "we have taken data for wimp search using one crystal with a background level of approximately 7  cpd at 10kev .",
    "the amount of data was 237  kg@xmath0days .",
    "the different timing characteristics between nuclear recoil and electron recoil in crystal make it possible to statistically separate the nuclear recoil events from the @xmath16 background using the mean time distribution  @xcite . in order to have a good reference distribution of the mean time for them",
    ", we took calibration data of electron recoil from the @xmath16 source and nuclear recoil from the neutron source .",
    "the @xmath16 calibration data was obtained with a full - size crystal by a @xmath12cs source in the copper chamber of y2l .",
    "identical setup and conditions as for the wimp search data were used . for one week irradiation",
    ", we took low energy @xmath16-ray events equivalent to approximately 3000  kg@xmath0days wimp search data .",
    "neutron calibration data were obtained by exposing a small - size test crystal ( 3  x  3  x  3  @xmath1 ) to neutrons from 300  mci am - be source , prepared at seoul national university  @xcite . in order to identify neutrons scattered from csi ,",
    "we used neutron detectors , made of bc501a contained in a cylindrical stainless steel vessel .",
    "each neutron detector is shielded by 5  cm lead and 10  cm paraffin , and set up at various angles with respect to the incident neutron direction .",
    "the am - be source is surrounded by liquid scintillator  ( lsc ) composed of 95% mineral oil and 5% of pseudocumene with a collimation hole to the direction of the crystal .",
    "the lsc acts as a tagging detector of 4.4  mev @xmath16 s which are simultaneously generated with neutrons from the am - be source as well as a neutron shield for the low surface neutron flux outside of the source .    in order to identify neutron - induced events",
    ", we required a coincidence between any one of the neutron detectors and the crystal . with a good neutron separation capability , we took neutron data , whose amount depended on energy , equivalent to approximately 1200  kg@xmath0days wimp search data at 3 - 11  kev .",
    "we also took electron recoil data using a @xmath12cs source for the test crystal used for the neutron calibration .",
    "this data is compared with the electron recoil calibration data obtained for the full - size crystal to confirm that neutron calibration data can be used for the full - size crystal .",
    "single photo - electrons  ( spes ) in an event is identified by applying a clustering algorithm to the fadc data .",
    "the energy deposition is evaluated from the sum of charges of all spes in the event .",
    "also , using the time information of spes we calculate mean time  ( mt ) .",
    "the mt distribution of events above 3  kev and up to 11  kev is used to extract the fraction of nuclear recoil events for wimp search .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ low_pulse ] ( b ) , the single clusters of low energy events are well reconstructed in our daq system . a clustering algorithm to identify each spe signal",
    "is applied for the data analysis .",
    "the clustering algorithm includes the identification of local maximum to form isolated cluster using the fadc bins above the pedestal and the separation of neighboring cluster in the case two local maximum is found in a cluster .",
    "a threshold is applied to the pulse height to select spe candidate .",
    "additionally the spe candidate with an unusually narrow pulse width out of 3@xmath20 is rejected .",
    "[ low_pulse ] ( c ) shows result of clustering of ( b ) .",
    "the sum of the single cluster charges for whole window  ( 32  @xmath19s ) are used to calculate the deposited energy .",

    "[ spespec ] shows the charge distribution of single cluster after clustering of 5.9  kev peak from a @xmath22fe source without height threshold .",
    "the distribution is fitted by two superimposed poisson functions ( one for the spe and the other for the spe - overlapped signal ) with exponential noise component : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mean of the poisson distribution , and @xmath26 is the gain factor of the pmt . the fitting function is overlaid in the figure as a solid line . the ratio of the contribution of the two poisson distributions is 9.3% .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath2790% of spes make single clusters and @xmath2710% makes overlapped clusters .",
    "the ratio of the mean values of the two poisson distributions , @xmath28 , is 2.11  @xmath3  0.03 which is consisted with a expectation considering overlap of up to 3-spes . in this fit",
    ", the most probable value  ( mpv ) of the spe is obtained as 0.86  pc . from the total charge of 59.5  kev from a @xmath21am source ,",
    "the photoelectron yield of this crystal is obtained as 5.5/kev .",
    "the photoelectron yield is calibrated at the beginning and at the end of a run .",
    "the results show stability of the light output within 1% for the whole period .",
    "the time - dependent gain variation is corrected by the mpv which is obtained from the spe charge spectrum of low energy ( 4 - 8  kev ) wimp search data and its poisson fit .",
    "every one week s wimp search data are accumulated to the fit .",
    "the result shows that the gain is stable within 5% for each pmt in the whole period .    the pmt noise , which was also detected without the crystal , is seen by both pmts which have very fast timing characteristics .",
    "a similar noise was reported by another group  @xcite .",
    "it seems to be originated from a spark in the dynode structure  @xcite .",
    "the pmt noise usually induces an abnormally big cluster .",
    "therefore , the charge of the biggest cluster and the mean charge of clusters for each event can be used to reject these events .",
    "we construct a good event - band using the compton scattering events from @xmath12cs , and they are compared with pmt noise events in fig .",
    "pmt noise events were taken from the same system without the crystal in the copper chamber .",
    "the distance between the two pmts is maintained equal to that for the crystal - attached set - up . in the 25.4  days data , equivalent to 167  kg@xmath0days wimp search data , only two events passed all the cuts with the 3kev energy threshold .",
    "we conclude that the pmt background after the cuts is negligible .",
    "the same cut is applied to the compton scattering data and the efficiency was found to be approximately 60% independent of energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ effi ] .",
    "we applied the same cuts to the calibration data taken with the test crystal .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath12cs and the neutron calibration data for the test crystal are compared with @xmath12cs data for the full - size crystal in the fig .  [ effi ] .",
    "about a 10% difference between the full - size and test crystals is observed .",
    "this is mainly due to the different pmts used .",
    "we assign a systematic uncertainty in efficiency to account for this difference . with a similarity of efficiency for neutron and the @xmath16 calibration data in test crystal",
    ", we can conclude that we can use @xmath16 calibration data for efficiency calculations of wimp search data . a slight difference in efficiency between @xmath16 and neutron data is also included as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the systematic error for the efficiency calculation is summed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is efficiency difference between the full - size crystal and the test crystal , @xmath31 is the efficiency difference between the nuclear recoil and the @xmath16 recoil events .",
    "efficiency corrected energy spectrum of events before and after the cuts are shown in fig .  [ energy ] .",
    "events below 11  kev are used for the wimp search .    to estimate the wimp signal fraction in the wimp search data , we introduce a mean time  ( mt ) value which is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the charge and the time of the @xmath35th cluster respectively , and",
    "@xmath36 is the time of the first cluster ( assumed as time zero ) .    because we use different crystals for the neutron calibration , we need to confirm whether the two different crystals show the same mt characteristics .",

    "the mean value of the log(mt ) distribution as a function of energy is shown in fig  [ mtcompv ] .",
    "an excellent agreement between the test crystal and the full - size crystal for the compton electron allows us to use the neutron signal from the test crystal as a reference for nuclear recoil signal for the full - size crystal .",
    "a slight mt difference is adjusted by the assumption of a constant @xmath37  @xcite . where @xmath38 is the mt of the nuclear recoil and @xmath39 is the mt of the electron recoil .",
