    "texture analysis has been a fundamental research topic , being used for image retrieval , object recognition , image segmentation , and so on @xcite .",
    "the developed methods have been successfully used in a number of different fields of application , such as medicine @xcite , biology @xcite , engineering @xcite , etc .",
    "several approaches have been described in the literature to extract meaningful information from texture images @xcite and a particular category of these methods comprise those employing some sort of image transform , like fourier @xcite , wavelets @xcite , and gabor @xcite , for example .",
    "most of these transforms were primarily developed for image processing , and hence they have the property of describing the image from another viewpoint , clarifying patterns that were not evident by the simple inspection of pixel values .    while transforms like fourier and wavelets are classical and well - known in the literature , in the last years other paradigms of image transform have been proposed and studied , mainly for applications in image processing .",
    "one of such paradigms is the discrete schroedinger transform , as described in @xcite .",
    "this is a non - linear operation that simulates a quantum system , where the image is assumed to be the initial distribution of a wave function and from that point it starts to evolve following the well - established schroedinger equation . despite the promising results achieved by this transform in different tasks of image processing , up to our knowledge",
    ", there is no attempt to employ it as an auxiliary operation for the extraction of texture descriptors .",
    "based on this , we propose to employ the discrete schroedinger transform for the extraction of meaningful features capable of expressing the information enclosed within a texture in a meaningful way , with precision and robustness . after being operated by the schroedinger transform , the central statistical moments , as described in @xcite ,",
    "are extracted from the distribution evolving in time . as detailed for example in @xcite ,",
    "central moments succinctly quantify statistical distributions , yielding to a powerful description of the transform .    in this context ,",
    "the schroedinger transform works like a non - linear operator over the image , capable of detecting discontinuities in the distribution of pixels , both with regards to the magnitude as well as to the spatial distribution of such discontinuities at different scales .",
    "such heterogeneous patterns play an important role in the localization of structural patterns along the texture and when the statistical information of this operation is provided by the moments , instead of only accounting for the homogeneity of pixels , now the distribution of discontinuities is also quantified , attenuating the redundant information of regions with homogeneous pixels .",
    "the efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on the classification of three texture databases in the literature , to know , outex @xcite , uiuc @xcite and usptex @xcite .",
    "the results are compared to other well - known texture descriptors and confirm the potential of the proposal to characterise real - world textures .",
    "these tests are also repeated when uiuc images are affected by two types of random noise ( gaussian and `` salt & pepper '' ) .",
    "schroedinger features obtained the best performance in this task once more .",
    "finally , our proposal is applied to a problem from the real world , to know , the identification of plant species based on leaf images .",
    "again , the proposed features achieved the highest rate of samples correctly identified .",
    "there are essentially two operations in imaging that led to the development of schroedinger transform : distance transforms and image segmentation .",
    "the development of a schroedinger distance transform ( sdt ) comes from the relation between the schroedinger equation and hamilton - jacobi solvers , used as a generalied model for distance mappings @xcite .",
    "this application is proposed in @xcite , starting from the fact that classical mechanics is actually only a limiting case of quantum mechanics and using hamilton - jacobi formalism to find an efficient approximate solution to the euclidean distance transform . following a similar idea , a wave function representation of a distance transform",
    "is developed in @xcite and employed for shape representation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors extend the schroedinger distance transform to be used in convolution operations as well as to obtain histograms of oriented gradients ( hog ) .",
    "parallel to sdt , another approach named discrete schroedinger transform ( dst ) , applied to image segmentation , is introduced in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors propose a new method for boundary extraction by adapting a deformable model from classical mechanics to a quantum mechanics context .",
    "this approach is detailed in @xcite where the transform is generalised as a tool for image analysis , not only for contour extraction , but also as a band - pass filter and for image segmentation .",
    "the schroedinger equation is also used in a similar way in @xcite for segmentation , by replacing the potential function by the grey - level image .",
    "finally , concerning to image processing , it is worth to mention the existence of other quantum - based approaches , like that developed in @xcite , where a quantum signal processing ( qsp ) framework is proposed , making use of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to develop generalised algorithms for signal and image analysis .",
    "although qsp shares some background on quantum physics with schroedinger transform , they are quite different in terms of algorithms and operations .    here , we focus on the discrete schroedinger transform , using the deformable model approach to schroedinger transform , as it was already applied to grey - level images ( for filtering ) and has an easier and more evident generalization to texture analysis .",
    "the development of the discrete schroedinger transform ( dst ) in @xcite starts from the analogy between the contour of an object of interest and the path of a particle .",
    "a well - known model @xcite in image segmentation states that the parametrised contour @xmath2 $ ] of a real - world object should minimise the following energy functional : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters named , respectively , tension , rigidity and outer energy .",
    "all of them are tuned according to each particular problem .",
    "the function minimizing @xmath7 can be seen actually as the shortest path between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , satisfying the underlying constraints .",
    "quantum mechanics generalises such idea by replacing @xmath10 by a particle moving from the initial position @xmath11 at a time @xmath12 towards the final position @xmath13 at time @xmath14 .",
    "now the concept of minimum distance is replaced by what is called a kernel @xmath15 and this takes into consideration not only the shortest but all the possible paths between @xmath11 and @xmath13 , appropriately weighted .",
    "@xmath15 is computed by summing up the contribution of each path @xmath16 , according to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the set of all possible paths between @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 being @xmath23 and @xmath24 constants , @xmath25 the imaginary number , and @xmath7 obtained by minimizing the generalised energy functional , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lagrangian of the system .",
    "the probability of a particle moving from @xmath11 to @xmath13 is given by : @xmath28    @xmath29 ( and @xmath15 as a consequence ) need to be computed in order to find the law of motion for the particle and therefore the minimizing function , which by recalling the analogy to the energy function ( equation [ eq : energy ] ) , will be useful for image analysis purposes .",
    "although this is a solvable problem when the lagrangian is well - known and simple , it becomes very difficult and time - consuming for more complex systems .",
    "in such cases , numerical approximations use to be computed , starting from the representation of the kernel by a wave function @xmath30 solving the schroedinger equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants and @xmath34 is the potential component in the lagrangian of the system . in the domain of an image @xmath35",
    "two types of representation for this equation can be defined , although here we focus on the simplest i - type schroedinger transform , where the potential part is discarded , and the equation is represented in a compact version through : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the laplacian operator and @xmath38 is a constant",
    ".    the numerical solution @xmath39 of equation [ eq : schroedinger_image ] can be found in a simple and fast way through the fourier transform . in the fourier domain ,",
    "the transform @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fourier transform of @xmath35 and @xmath43 is a mapping of euclidean distances from the centre of the frequency domain in an @xmath44 mask : @xmath45    finally , the schroedinger transform @xmath46 of the image is given , as can be supposed , by the modulus of the fourier inverse transform of @xmath40 . the parameter @xmath38 is free to be set according to each particular application .",
    "this work proposes the use of the discrete schroedinger transform to obtain image descriptors , with particular application to the classification of grey - scale texture images .",
    "dst has been applied to several problems in image processing and analysis , like filtering , segmentation , contour extraction , etc .",
    "@xcite . however , up to our knowledge",
    ", it has never been applied before to extract image features .",
    "more specifically , we analyse the time evolution of the schroedinger equation when the initial wave function is assumed to correspond to the original image .",
    "we know from the theory of fourier transforms that equation [ eq : schroed_fourier ] is equivalent to a convolution in spatial domain with the fourier inverse transform of a complex gaussian , which is also known to be another complex gaussian . as we are not concerned with absolute values ,",
    "any constant can be disregarded and therefore we end up working with the simplified kernel @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath50 is now a basic parameter ( originally related to time in the quantum physics context ) .",
    "this expression can be trivially broken into its real ( @xmath51 ) and imaginary ( @xmath52 ) part : @xmath53 these are sinusoids whose frequencies increase quadratically and figure [ fig : mask ] depicts @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath54 $ ] and for two different values of @xmath50 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +      generally speaking , the proposed method provided descriptors capable of classifying the benchmark databases with higher precision among all the seven compared methods , even when the databases present challenging properties , like the high number of classes or a high / low dissimilarity intra / inter - class , or when the images are subjected to the influence of random noise . such advantage can be explained by understanding the way that schroedinger transform works over the texture .",
    "it essentially operates at different scales ( by setting appropriate values of @xmath55 ) and highlights discontinuities on the image . nevertheless , unlike classical techniques such as high - pass filters for example , the global information enclosed by the kernel @xmath15 , which takes into account all the possible paths , allows to detect not only the place where such discontinuities emerge in the image , but also the magnitude of the jump in the pixel intensity , the size of homogeneous regions limited by such edges and even the direction followed by the edge .",
    "when the moments are extracted , the highlighted edges make the homogeneous regions more evident whereas the multiscale operation makes the descriptors less susceptible to noise and small neighbourhood variations , giving rise to more reliable features .",
    "considering the above , the method presented here is especially recommended for the analysis of textures that , besides the usual presence of recognizable statistical patterns , also can be described in terms of their discontinuities . despite",
    "the fact that this type of image can be easily found , mainly in the analysis of heterogeneous materials , the literature on pattern recognition in grey - level images uses to model these features as if they were two independent characteristics : textures and shapes ( or edges ) , respectively .",
    "the analysis proposed by the schroedinger descriptors works in practice like a joint distribution of texture and heterogeneity descriptors , allowing in this way a more complete and robust representation of the image .",
    "such robustness was confirmed here by the interesting results achieved over the benchmark databases , including situations with the presence of noise",
    ".    regards to the leaf plant database ( 1200tex ) , it is possible to say that the proposed method confirmed the positive expectations in this practical situation and showed its value as an automatic solution to help taxonomists in such a complex task as the identification of plant species .",
    "this test also illustrates a typical example where the positioning of discontinuities along the texture is a potential candidate to provide meaningful information about the object being analysed .",
    "particularly , the surface of leaves are commonly permeated by veins at different levels of scale ( primary and secondary ) , whose distribution is known to have important role in distinguishing plant species @xcite .",
    "this work proposed to apply the discrete schroedinger transform to provide descriptors of grey - level texture images .",
    "the obtained features were employed to classify three classical databases of textures and outperformed other texture descriptors in the literature , such as lbp+var , mr8 and others .",
    "a similar test was accomplished to assess the influence of random noise over the images and again the proposed features presented the best performance .",
    "such good result was expected from the individual operation of schroedinger transform . while this transform can act as a conventional multiscale operator , at the same time it also highlights particular edges making the images less sensitive to noises and artifacts , and quantifying the degree of homogeneity within a range of scales in the transformed image .",
    "more than the numerical advantage , the high percentage of images correctly classified in so large and heterogeneous databases suggests more attention to the schroedinger transform as an auxiliary operation for the extraction of image descriptors and encourages its application in real - world problems where a precise description of texture images plays important role .",
