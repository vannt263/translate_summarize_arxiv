    "spin clusters with predominantly antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions exhibit steps in the equilibrium magnetization as a function of magnetic field . these magnetization steps ( mst s ) arise from energy - level crossings which change the ground state .",
    "they are observed at very low temperatures when only the ground state contributes to the magnetization @xmath0 . in recent years",

    "an overall review of mst s was published recently.@xcite for recent reviews of the magnetic properties of molecular clusters , including mst s , see ref .  .",
    "in a molecular crystal the af clusters are normally all of one type .",
    "the mst s then give values of exchange constants and anisotropy parameters for that cluster type .",
    "a diluted magnetic material , on the other hand , contains numerous types of spin clusters .",
    "different cluster types give rise to different series of mst s .",
    "in addition to exchange constants and anisotropy parameters , the mst s also give information concerning the populations of the different cluster types .",
    "the populations are related to the magnitudes of the mst s in the different series .",
    "the results for the cluster populations can be used to check if the distribution of the magnetic ions is random .",
    "most previous studies of mst s in diluted magnetic crystals were on three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials,@xcite although some quantum wells were also studied.@xcite the present paper , however , is devoted to mst s from a diluted af heisenberg chain ( 1d ) .",

    "the space between the combined @xmath31 chains is occupied by tetramethylammonium groups .",
    "the strongest magnetic interaction in tmmc is the isotropic exchange between nearest neighbor ( nn ) @xmath29 ions in the chain .",
    "the nn exchange constant , obtained from various experiments ( e.g. , ref .  ) , is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "other intrachain exchange constants are believed to be much smaller , and are usually neglected .",
    "the exchange interaction between different chains is orders of magnitude smaller than the intrachain interaction , but is responsible for the long - range af order below the nel temperature @xmath34 .",
    "the anisotropy in tmmc is mainly due to the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it is of the easy - plane type , and is two orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant exchange interaction.@xcite    at room temperature both tmmc and its cd analog [ , known as tmcc ] have isomorphous hexagonal structures ( space group @xmath35 ) .",
    "crystallographic phase transitions at lower temperatures result in a lower symmetry , and in small structural differences between tmmc and tmcc.@xcite these differences are often assumed to be unimportant , although it is conceivable that even small changes in the crystal structure have some effect on the magnetic behavior , especially on spin relaxation at low temperatures .",

    "it is assumed that the spin system is in thermal equilibrium with a constant - temperature heat reservoir .",
    "this equilibrium theory is suitable for interpreting the data that were obtained in the slowly - varying magnetic fields ( `` dc fields '' ) of the superconducting magnets .",

    "the second largest peak , near @xmath235 is the first mst from quartets .",
    "it is predicted to occur at a field which is @xmath258 times that of the first peak for pairs .",
    "the second @xmath19 peak from quartets should be at a field which is @xmath171 higher than the first peak from pairs .",
    "the structure of the peak near @xmath204 is possibly due to a superposition of these two mst s , although it is much wider than @xmath171 .    in the ihf scenario the field at the first mst for finite chains with even @xmath7",
    "can be estimated from the energy levels given in ref .  .",
    "for @xmath7 between @xmath175 and @xmath247 , this field is nearly proportional to @xmath259 .",
    "a similar approximate dependence on @xmath7 holds for af rings ( closed chains).@xcite on this basis the small sharp peak near @xmath248 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) is due to octets or sextets .",
    "there is also an indication of a small peak near @xmath260 , which would be attributed to larger clusters .",
    "although the ihf scenario accounts for the fields of many of the observed mst s , this scenario is very questionable for this mn concentration . assuming that the mn cations are randomly distributed , the number of quartets for @xmath261 is smaller than the number of pairs by a factor of @xmath262 . for sextets and",
    "octets the factors are @xmath263 and @xmath264 , respectively .",
    "therefore , unless the deviations from random distribution are extremely large , it should not have been possible to observe mst s from sextets or octets if the behavior followed the ihf scenario .",
    "the first mst from quartets might have been detectable , but it should have been very small compared to the mst from pairs .",
    "this was not the case in the pulse field experiments ( figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] ) . as predicted , the equilibrium data in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , for nearly the same @xmath3 , indicate that the first mst from quartets is much less pronounced than the first mst from pairs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) the first mst from pairs stands out clearly but the second mst from pairs is barely visible , and the third is totally absent .",
    "these results also are not well understood within the ihf scenario , although some indication of such a behavior appeared in simulations by nakano and miyashita for iron clusters with ring structure.@xcite    in the cr scenario the mst s in figs .",
    "[ fig12](b ) and [ fig13 ] ( both for decreasing b ) are interpreted as follows .",
    "the peak just below @xmath204 is the first fundamental peak @xmath145 , with some contributions from @xmath265 , @xmath266 , etc .",
    "the peak at @xmath235 is the second harmonic peak @xmath144 .",
    "the small peak at @xmath248 is the third - harmonic peak @xmath267 or the fourth - harmonic peak @xmath268 .",
    "the broad peak near @xmath269 is possibly @xmath150 . because this interpretation uses only pairs and singles,@xcite it is not open to objections based on the low populations of quartets and larger clusters .",
    "the cr scenario also accounts for some features of the up trace in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) .",
    "the large peak near @xmath235 is attributed to the cr process of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , except that the directions of both spin flips are reversed .",
    "this process allows the singles to relax toward a state with a higher magnetization .",
    "the magnetization of the pairs also increases by this process .    the process in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) involves only one single and one pair , and is the simplest cr process between singles and pairs .",
    "it accounts for the @xmath144 .",
    "more complicated cr processes can lead to other `` harmonic peaks , '' such as @xmath267 , @xmath150 , @xmath270 .",
    "these peaks are expected to be smaller than @xmath144 .",
    "the peak @xmath267 may involve processes such as a cr between a pair and two singles , or between a pair and a single which undergoes a double spin flip .",
    "the peak @xmath150 may involve a spin flip in a single and spin flips in two pairs , etc . in the up trace the observed peak at @xmath271 , and the small peaks at @xmath272 , and",
    "@xmath273 may correspond to the @xmath267 , @xmath150 and @xmath270 harmonics .",
    "the peak observed near @xmath204 is a superposition of the first fundamental peak from pairs , @xmath274 , and the harmonics @xmath265 , @xmath266 , etc .",
    "as already noted , in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) the second mst from pairs is barely visible , and the third is totally absent .",
    "these results suggest that for @xmath231 , the spin relaxation for pairs in fields above @xmath215 is very slow compared to a millisecond .",
    "as @xmath5 sweeps through a region where a mst from pairs should have occurred , the pairs are unable to relax towards the new ground state .",
    "we speculate that the slow spin relaxation for pairs is mainly due to a reduction of cr between pairs and singles , and that this reduction is related to the saturation of the singles in fields above @xmath215 .",
    "cr between different pairs , or between pairs and larger clusters , is expected to become slower as @xmath3 decreases.@xcite among the three samples , such cr processes should be least efficient for @xmath231 .",
    "non - equilibrium behavior is also evident for @xmath230 .",
    "the large low - field hysteresis for this mn concentration , in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) , is somewhat similar to the hysteresis in fig .",
    "[ fig12](a ) for @xmath231 . in the up trace ,",
    "the large peak near @xmath275 is identified as the @xmath144 peak , and is attributed to the cross relaxation process in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , with the arrows reversed .    the down trace in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) exhibits large peaks near @xmath276 and @xmath277 approximately , and a small peak near @xmath278 .",
    "the widths at half height of these peaks , @xmath279 , @xmath250 , and @xmath280 , respectively , are all much smaller than thermal width of @xmath252 at @xmath129 .",
    "these widths , which are similar to those for @xmath231 , indicate non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "the largest peak in fig .  [ fig11](b ) , at @xmath276 , is undoubtedly the first fundamental peak from pairs , @xmath145 .",
    "the second fundamental peak @xmath146 is also observed near @xmath184 .",
    "the cr scenario predicts large second - harmonic peaks @xmath144 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 at @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 , respectively .",
    "these fields are close to @xmath284 , @xmath282 , and @xmath285 , of large peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) .",
    "the peak observed near @xmath278 is consistent with @xmath268 .",
    "it is possible , but far from certain , that the small peaks at @xmath286 and @xmath287 are @xmath150 and @xmath288 .",
    "the main difference between @xmath230 and @xmath231 is that for the higher mn concentration there are still prominent mst s above @xmath204 . for @xmath229 the second and third mst s from pairs",
    "are even more pronounced [ see fig . [ fig10](a ) ] .",
    "these results suggest that at these fields the spin relaxation rate for pairs increases rapidly with mn concentration .",
    "we tentatively attribute this trend to the expected increase with @xmath3 of the efficacy of cr processes involving pairs , and pairs and larger clusters .      a definitive interpretation of the observed non - equilibrium behavior in pulsed fields is still lacking .",
    "however , it appears that for @xmath229 the non - equilibrium behavior is better explained by the ihf scenario . for @xmath231 and @xmath230 the data are better explained by spin flips associated with cr and with level crossings .",
    "the data suggest that at the high magnetic fields where the magnetization of singles is saturated , the spin relaxation rate for pairs increases rapidly with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this increase is tentatively attributed to the @xmath3-dependence of cr processes involving pairs .",
