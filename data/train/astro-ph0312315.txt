    "it has been known since the early 1970 s that the otherwise indistinguishable members of any given galactic globular cluster ( gc ) exhibit significant star - to - star variations in surface abundances of certain light elements ( most notably c and n , as well as o , and often na , al , and mg ) cen and m22 , both of which appear to have experienced some degree of self - enrichment . ] . however , while the abundance patterns commonly observed point to an origin in proton capture nucleosynthesis @xcite , identification of the specific reaction site(s ) and a full theoretical description of the abundance modifying process(es ) remain uncertain . as has been pointed out in numerous reviews",

    "* ) two possibilities exist :    first , the present day cluster stars may have modified their own surface compositions through some mixing process not included in standard models ( i.e. , an `` in situ '' scenario ) . by far the most promising candidate site in this regard is the region above the h - burning shell after first dredge - up in evolving cluster giants , where conditions for partial cn and possibly on - cycle reactions exist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for one of the earliest treatments ) .",
    "subsequent circulation of this material into the stellar envelope via meridional currents or turbulent diffusion ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will result in decreasing c abundances and increasing n with evolutionary state as has been observed along the red giant branches ( rgb ) of several metal - poor clusters ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for classic examples ) .",
    "moreover , the operation of such a mechanism can at least qualitatively explain the o and mg versus na and al anticorrelations found among the most luminous red giants in several clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "common to all models of this process is the prohibition of `` extra mixing '' by the molecular weight gradient left behind by the inward excursion of the convective envelope during first dredge - up .",
    "only after the molecular weight discontinuity has been destroyed by the outward moving h - burning shell , an event marked by the rgb luminosity function ( lf ) bump , is mixing expected to take place .",
    "this theoretical prediction appears to be borne out by observations of decreased li abundances following the lf bump in ngc 6752 and similar drops in @xmath2c@xmath3c  seen by @xcite in ngc 6528 and m4",
    ".    however , this can not be the entire picture . as early as 1978 ,",
    "it was noted by @xcite that the subgiant branch ( sgb ) and likely the main - sequence ( ms ) stars of 47 tuc also possessed star - to - star differences in ch and cn band strengths .",
    "this has been most recently followed in 47 tuc to @xmath4 mag below the ms turn - off ( msto ) by @xcite .",
    "an analysis of their observed cn and ch band strengths yields factors of 10 variations in n anticorrelated with factors of 3 differences in c @xcite , matching those found among the more evolved members .",
    "such cn and ch ( n and c ) variations have also been shown to exist among the ms , msto , or sgb stars of ngc 6752 , m71 , and m5 @xcite moreover , star - to - star variations in na , al , o , and mg , similar to those found among the luminous cluster stars , have been identified among the sgb and msto stars of 47 tuc @xcite , ngc 6752 , m71 @xcite , and m5 @xcite .",
    "although the various correlations and anticorrelations among these elements suggest the presence of material exposed to proton - capture reactions , such stars lie well below the lf bump and , particularly in the case of the ms stars , no mechanism is known for circulating significant quantities of cn(o ) nucleosynthesized material to their surfaces .",
    "thus the second possible origin of the gc abundance variations - they have been set in place before rgb ascent and are due to the operation of some mechanism early in the cluster history ( sometimes referred to as a `` primordial '' scenario ) .",
    "a number of possibilities exist as are discussed extensively by @xcite , including : that the proto - cluster gas was inhomogeneous in these elements ( a true primordial origin ) , that there was an extended period of star formation of sufficient duration to allow some low - mass stars to form with material ejected from more massive already - evolved cluster asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , or that the present day cluster stars have accreted agb ejecta onto their surfaces after their formation .",
    "the appeal of agb stars as sites of the proton capture nucelosynthesis lies in their ability to modify the cluster gas in light elements ( including c , n , o , al , na , and mg - see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while not altering the abundances of heavy elements",
    ".    as the reader has likely noted , observational evidence exists for both mixing and early contamination scenarios , which has led many investigators to conclude that the compositions of the cluster stars we observe today are not the result of one or the other scenario exclusively , but rather both .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to difficulties in disentangling the contributions of each process among the more luminous cluster stars - a problem that can only be reconciled by exploring the compositions of a cluster s stars to the msto and below .",
    "clearly , abundance trends found among a cluster s ms stars reflect the original makeup of the bright giants , while deviations from this `` baseline '' composition are likely the result of mixing .",
    "this was recently demonstrated in the case of m13 by @xcite ( hereafter bcs02 ) - that a large spread in c abundances exists among the sgb stars of m13 , which presumably reflects star - to - star variations in c abundances set early in the cluster history . however , the sgb c abundances also appear larger than those found by other investigators among the more luminous m13 stars , implying the operation of a mixing mechanism on the rgb which has reduced surface c abundances .    in the present paper ,",
    "we return to m13 and extend our sample more than two magnitudes fainter to include ms stars .",
    "in addition , we have also obtained spectra of m13 bright giants observed in earlier studies to verify our abundance scale .",
    "our results confirm those of bcs02 - that a primordial spread in the distribution of light elements exists in m13 which has further been modified during rgb ascent .",
    "measurements of the 3360  nh bands also were obtained for a handful of the more luminous stars in our sample .",
    "n abundances calculated from these bands suggest a c versus n anticorrelation at the level of the msto .",
    "the initial sample of stars in m13 was aimed to produce subgiants at the base of the rgb .",
    "it consisted of those stars from the photometric database ( described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) located more than 150 arcsec from the center of m13 ( to avoid crowding ) with @xmath5 and with @xmath6 mag . a slitmask with 0.7 arcsec wide slitlets , narrower than normal to enhance the spectral resolution and minimize contributions from adjacent stars in these crowded fields , was designed using jgc s software from this sample and used in may 2001 with lris @xcite at keck . for this slitmask , as for all those used for the m13 stars , the red side of lris was set to include the nad lines and h@xmath7 .",
    "we used the highest possible dispersion , 0.64 / pixel ( 29 km  s@xmath8/pixel ) or 1.9 / spectral resolution element there , to facilitate radial velocity confirmation of cluster membership . given that the radial velocity of m13 is 246 km  s@xmath8",
    ", distinguishing field stars from cluster members is then straightforward .",
    "the blue side of lris @xcite was used with the 600 line / mm grism blazed at 5000   . the detector for lris - b at that time was a 2048x2048 ccd not optimized for uv response .",
    "the spectra covered the range from @xmath93400 to 5000   , thus including the strongest cn band at 3885  and the g band of ch at 4300 , with a resolution of @xmath94    ( 1.0   / pixel ) .",
    "two additional slitmasks were defined from this sample and used in may 2002 during less than ideal weather conditions for 6 exposures of 4800 sec each .",
    "the spectra were dithered by moving the stars along the length of the slitlets by 2 arcsec between exposures .",
    "these spectra are part of those presented in bcs02 .    because of the crowded fields , in addition to the intended stars some slitlets contained additional stars bright enough to provide suitable spectra , and these were utilized as well . as might be expected from the luminosity function , most of the secondary sample consists of stars at or just below the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "hence subtraction of sequential exposures was not possible , and they were reduced individually using figaro @xcite scripts , then the 1d spectra for each object were summed .    based on the serendipitous main sequence stars found in the 2002 observations ( see the plots in bcs02 ) , we decided to try to reach main sequence stars well below the turnoff in m13 , sufficiently faint to be cool enough to have detectable ch bands .",
    "the criteria used to define the sample from the photometric database were 19.3 @xmath10 i @xmath10 19.7 ,",
    "v - i within 0.06 mag of the main sequence of m13 , taken as 1.26 + 0.28(i-19.4 ) , and located more than 200 arcsec from the center of m13 .",
    "a single slitmask with 0.8 arcsec wide slitlets was designed and used at keck with lris june 26 , 2003 .",
    "the blue spectra cover the full range from the atmospheric cutoff to 5000   , with 1.0   / pixel and a spectral resolution of @xmath9 4   .",
    "four exposures totalling 4200 sec were obtained . the new very high quantum efficiency detector for lris - b consisting of two 2kx4k marconi ccds , with 15 @xmath11  pixels and a readout noise of 4.0 e@xmath12 ,",
    "was completed and installed into lris in june 2002 , and so was available for these observations .",
    "the high uv throughput of lris - b with this new sensitive detector for the first time enabled us to reach the nh bands in the brighter of these stars with some precision .",
    "the locations of the faint program stars on the m13 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) are shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "there are published surveys @xcite in which ch indices have been used to determine [ c / fe ]  values for large samples of the highest luminosity giants in m13 .",
    "however , our keck / lris sample of low luminosity stars in m13 has no overlap with these earlier works . to ensure that the merger of our data for faint stars in m13 with these published datasets for ch band strengths in m13 giants is valid , we need to verify the consistency of the different measurements of the ch indices and resulting abundances . to demonstrate this",
    ", we obtained new blue spectra of a small sample of bright giants with published ch band strengths from earlier studies , and remeasured their ch indices with the same procedures used for the lower luminosity m13 stars of our main sample ( as described below ) .",
    "these spectra were taken in april and may , 2003 at the hale telescope on palomar mountain during observing runs intended primarily for other projects .",
    "the blue channel of the double spectrograph @xcite was used with a 1200 line / mm grating and a loral 512x2788 15@xmath11  pixel ccd , giving 0.55   / pixel with a spectral resolution of 1.9    for a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "our analysis essentially repeats that of bcs02 and is fully described in @xcite ( hereafter bc01 ) and the reader is referred to these works for details . to summarize : strengths of the 4350   ch ( g ) bands of our program stars",
    "were measured via the i(ch ) index of @xcite - an index which compares the flux removed by the g - band to the adjacent continuum on both sides .",
    "the resulting indices , calculated using bandpasses corrected for the radial velocity of m13 , are plotted for the sample of faint stars as a function of i magnitude in figure [ fig_2 ] . the decrease in ch band strengths near i",
    "@xmath0 18 is due to the higher temperatures of the msto stars ( as pointed out by bc01 ) .",
    "however , among the fainter ms stars in the sample ( near i @xmath0 19.5 ) , the surface temperatures have dropped by roughly 300k and again a large and significant scatter in ch band strengths is apparent .",
    "the one sigma error bars plotted for the present sample have been determined entirely from poisson statistics in the molecular - band and continuum spectral windows .    in a similar manner , the strength of absorption by the 3350  nh band was measured in spectra of the more luminous members of the keck ms / msto sample using the double sided logarithmic @xmath13 index as defined in @xcite . the resulting indices ( and one sigma poisson error bars )",
    "are also plotted in figure [ fig_2 ] .",
    "this marks the first time nh bands have been observed among such faint stars in a globular cluster .",
    "spectra of two msto stars exhibiting differing nh band strengths , and two ms stars with differing ch band strengths are shown in figure [ fig_3 ] .    in order to relate the observed indices to the underlying [ c / fe ] , we employ a series of synthetic spectra based on marcs model atmospheres .",
    "our models are those used in bc01 and bcs02 and based on the 16 gyr @xmath14 $ ] = @xmath151.48 o - enhanced isochrone grid of @xcite .",
    "the locations of the model points on the m13 i , v@xmath15i cmd are shown in figure [ fig_1 ] assuming @xmath16 = 14.43 and a reddening of e(b@xmath15v ) = 0.02 as in bc01 and bcs02 .    from each model and a given set of c / n / o abundances ,",
    "synthetic spectra were computed using the ssg program ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the line list of @xcite at a step size of 0.02  ( see bc01 for further details ) assuming the average heavy element compositions of @xcite .",
    "the result was then convolved with a gaussian kernel to match the resolution of the observed spectra and i(ch ) and @xmath13 indices were measured .",
    "the model indices for i(ch ) are illustrated in figure [ fig_2 ] for four c abundances ( as in bcs02 ) : [ c / fe ]  = @xmath150.85 and [ c / fe ]  = @xmath151.1 , which roughly match the observed compositions of m13 s cn - weak and strong bright giants respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and [ c / fe ]  = 0.0 and [ c / fe ]  = @xmath150.5 .",
    "also plotted in figure [ fig_2 ] are @xmath13 indices for a variety of [ n / fe ]  values .",
    "note that among these relatively warm ms / msto stars , there is little sensitivity in the ch ( nh ) band strengths to changes in n , o ( c , o ) abundances ( as opposed to the cool giants where molecular equilibrium must be considered , particularly with regard to o ) . as a check of this , table [ tbl-1 ] shows the sensitivity of i(ch ) and @xmath13 to such changes in a cool ms model ( t@xmath17=5601 , log g=4.66 , corresponding to an m13 ms star with @xmath18=19.60 ) .",
    "following bcs02 , we have applied the method of @xcite to convert the observed indices to corresponding c and n abundances : the model isoabundance curves were interpolated to the @xmath19 of each program star , and the observed index converted into the corresponding abundance based on the synthetic index at that @xmath19 .",
    "resulting c and n abundances are plotted in figures [ fig_4 ] and [ fig_5 ] . note that the large error bars which accompany the stars of figure [ fig_4 ] near i=19 and the stars of low [ c / fe ]  ( @xmath20 ) are due to the overall weakness of the ch bands  small errors in i(ch ) therefore result in large changes in [ c / fe ] .",
    "likewise , a similar situation exists among the msto stars with measured nh band strengths .      as with the faint stars",
    ", the i(ch ) index was measured from the spectra of the six bright m13 giants . for each star",
    "this value was compared to synthetic indices generated from model atmospheres whose stellar parameters were taken from the high resolution analyses of @xcite , and @xcite , including their heavy element and [ o / fe ] abundances .",
    "where available , [ n / fe ]  values from @xcite were also used . for two stars ( k188 and iii-7 ) ,",
    "n abundances were not available from the literature , and a value of + 1.0 was assumed . for star iii-7 ,",
    "an [ o / fe ] of 0.0 was used .",
    "the model parameters and the resulting [ c / fe ]  abundance which matched the observed i(ch ) indices are listed in table [ tbl-2 ] along with the c abundances from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the four bright giants in common with @xcite , we find an average offset of 0.03(@xmath1 0.14 ) dex in [ c / fe ]  ( present @xmath15 smith ) .",
    "we therefore consider our c abundances to be essentially on the same scale , as might be expected considering the similar analysis tools used .",
    "the difference between our results and those of @xcite are somewhat larger : 0.25(@xmath10.23 ) .",
    "however , almost half of this offset is driven by the result for ii-76 . excluding this star reduces the average difference to 0.14(@xmath10.07 ) .",
    "note that ii-76 has both a high [ o / fe ] and a lower [ n / fe ]  abundance as might be expected from a star with a lesser amount of cn(o)-cycle material in its atmosphere .",
    "the source of this discrepancy is likely the cooler model used for ii-76 by suntzeff ( t@xmath17 = 4220k versus the 4350k used here ) , as well as the lower o abundance ( [ o / fe ] = 0.0 ) and higher microturbulent velocity ( 2.5 km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "repeating our analysis with the values used by suntzeff reduces our resulting [ c / fe ]  by 0.32 dex to @xmath150.96 .",
    "the luminous stars of suntzeff plotted in figure [ fig_4 ] have therefore been shifted by 0.14 in [ c / fe ]  to place them on our abundance scale .",
    "given the use of the same modeling codes , line lists , and ch indices throughout our analysis , we presume the resulting c abundances from both the faint and bright star samples , as well as those of @xcite and @xcite ( with the appropriate shift ) , to be on the same abundance scale .",
    "any systematic differences due to different telescope / spectrograph systems will be minimized by the use of the i(ch ) index which uses continuum bands both blueward and redward of the ch feature to remove slope differences due to variations in instrumental response .",
    "there are several points to be made about the present results , which are given in tabular form in tables [ tbl - a1 ] and [ tbl - a2 ] of appendix a. first , as can be seen in figure [ fig_2 ] , significant differences in [ c / fe ]  exist among stars at least 1.5 mag fainter than the msto in m13 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of approximately 0.66 @xmath21 using the isochrone of figure [ fig_1 ] . among these old ms stars ,",
    "cn(o)-cycle reactions are entirely confined to the central core ( see for example figures 4 and 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as has been pointed out by numerous investigators , ms stars such as these are not thought to possess a mechanism that connects their surface with regions of energy generation ( namely the core ) . indeed , should such mixing take place , the subsequent paths of the stars in the cmd would be radically altered by the infusion of fresh h into the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one must conclude the source of the observed differences in [ c / fe ]  is likely not the stars themselves .",
    "moreover , the values of [ c / fe ]  among the ms stars are consistent with those found by bcs02 among the m13 sgb stars ( see figure [ fig_4 ] ) and imply little change in composition has occurred from the ms to at least the base of the sgb .",
    "figure [ fig_4 ] also includes the [ c / fe ]  values of @xcite and @xcite ( shifted upwards by 0.14 dex ) .",
    "as discussed in bcs02 , there appears to be a marked decline in [ c / fe ]  towards higher luminosities among the m13 giants .",
    "clearly an evolutionary change such as this can be best interpreted as the result of a mixing process bringing up c - depleted material from a region in which at least cn - cycle reactions are operating ( see bcs02 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig_4 ] is the location of the lf bump in m13 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the event which marks the destruction of the molecular weight gradient thought to inhibit deep mixing .",
    "unfortunately , the luminosity at which the onset of c depletion begins is uncertain due to the gap in the available data ( from 15 @xmath10 v @xmath10 17 ) .",
    "however , since an extrapolation of the trend in giant - branch [ c / fe ] abundance faintward intersects the magnitude of the lf bump at the average abundance of the fainter stars , it is reasonable to infer that the abundance decline begins near that event ; neither a significant decrease nor a significant increase in carbon abundance with a subsequent recovery to the original value hidden within the gap in our data is reasonably to be expected .",
    "the [ n / fe ]  values determined from the nh band strengths of the msto stars are plotted in figure [ fig_5 ] .",
    "although the error bars are admittedly larger than one would like owing to the weaknesses of the ch and nh bands among the warmer msto stars , a general anticorrelation between [ c / fe ]  and [ n / fe ]  is suggested .",
    "note that these abundances do not suffer from the inherent tendency towards c / n anticorrelations of analyses based on ch and cn band strengths .",
    "of course an overall c / n anticorrelation is known to be present among the evolved m13 stars and the values for the bright rgb stars of @xcite are also shown in figure [ fig_5 ] .",
    "immediately apparent is the shift of the rgb stars towards lower [ c / fe ] , as is expected from figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "if c - poor / n - rich material is indeed being circulated into the stellar envelopes during rgb ascent , the lack of near solar [ n / fe ]  rgb stars is also explained ( although the error bars on the two lower [ n / fe ]  msto stars severely limit the weight which can be placed on this statement ) . that higher n abundances do not appear to be found among the rgb stars under these circumstances",
    "is perhaps not a surprise if these stars are already leaving the msto with large [ n / fe ]  overabundances : an m13 msto star with [ c / fe ]  = @xmath150.4 and [ n / fe ]  = 1.0 which undergoes a mixing episode reducing [ c / fe ]  to @xmath151.2 will experience a rise in [ n / fe ]  of only 0.05 dex  in essence , the n abundances are already so large , the addition of freshly minted n via the cn - cycle results in only a small fractional change in [ n / fe ] .",
    "thus , while the error bars in figure [ fig_5 ] are large , we can at least claim it is not inconsistent with the assertion that we are seeing substantial star - to - star variations in c ( and n ) set early in the cluster history , which are further being modified by mixing during rgb ascent .",
    "the possibility of also mixing on - cycle material to the surface is more difficult to assess because of the large n variations among the msto stars . in the example above , an additional reduction in [ o / fe ] from + 0.45 to @xmath22 would increase [ n / fe ]  by 0.46 dex  and among the bright giants , even larger o depletions ( as much as [ o / fe ] = @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) have been noted .",
    "starting with an even larger n overabundance of + 1.4 reduces the change in [ n / fe ] to + 0.25 .",
    "however , at least from the small sample of figure [ fig_5 ] , it appears that none of the bright rgb stars possess larger n abundances than their msto counterparts , which in turn suggests the envelopes of at least the initially n - rich stars may not be cycled through a region of on - cycle reactions while on the rgb .",
    "clearly knowledge of the o abundances of the m13 msto stars would help settle this question .",
    "a similar result was noted in the more metal - poor clusters m92 and m15 by @xcite and @xcite ( respectively )  that substantial n overabundances are present from the sgb to agb that are not necessarily correlated with c abundances .",
    "indeed , an analogous situation can been seen in the present results and those of @xcite for m5 ( see figures [ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] ) : the `` higher '' [ c / fe ]  msto stars ( at @xmath25 ) span almost a dex in [ n / fe ] .",
    "it is clear that if we are to ascribe the same mechanism to the origin of the sgb / msto inhomogeneities in these clusters , it must be operating at the msto or earlier .",
    "that significant and correlated star - to - star differences in c and n , as well as o , na , al , and mg have been found among the sgb , msto , and ms stars of several clusters ( see references above ) , implies the operation of some process external to the present stars , presumably having taken place early in the cluster history .",
    "the discussion of @xcite includes a comprehensive look at various possibilities .",
    "it is worth while however , to revisit a few of the more critical constraints on any theory of the origin of the abundance variations .",
    "first , whatever mechanism has altered the light - element compositions of the cluster stars has left the heavy elements essentially untouched , at least to the limits of our ability to determine them  the analysis of m5 by @xcite is an excellent example .",
    "this alone would seem to exclude the possibility of the light - element variations arising from the merger of two distinct proto - cluster clouds ( as has been pointed out by numerous authors ) .",
    "second , these abundance variations appear to be almost ubiquitous among the population of galactic globular clusters . to highlight this ,",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fig_6 ] the [ c / fe ]   and [ n / fe ]  values for the present sample of m13 msto stars , the 47 tuc ms stars of @xcite , the m5 sgb stars of @xcite , and the msto stars of m71 from bc01 .",
    "note that bc01 did not directly extract c and n abundances from their observed indices  we have converted them here following the procedure outlined in @xcite and using the indices and models presented in bc01 ; the values are given in appendix a , table [ tbl - a3 ] .",
    "third , the elements which are observed to vary are associated with proton capture nucleosynthesis under conditions of cn and on - cycling .",
    "the source / site must process these cno - group elements and return this material to the cluster to be incorporated into the present population of low mass stars either before , during , or after their formation .",
    "a popular model which fits these constraints is the incorporation of ejecta from intermediate mass ( 3 - 6@xmath21 ) agb stars undergoing hot bottom burning and third dredge - up ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although difficulties such as the establishment of an o - na anti - correlation remain ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "however , as is discussed in @xcite and bcs02 , the quantities of material required to produce the observed star - to - star differences among the low luminosity stars ( most notably extreme c depletions ) , which are clearly not diluted as the convective envelopes deepen during rgb ascent , rules out any sort of simple accretion model . indeed , for the present m13 stars , roughly 70% of a c - poor ms star s total mass must be captured ejecta if the accreted matter is completely free of c ( see bcs02 ) .",
    "it is of course unclear how such an enormous amount of material can be returned to the cluster without appealing to a shallow initial mass function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor how the present stars can sweep up the necessary mass of ejecta .",
    "we note in figure [ fig_6 ] that the depletions in c do appear smaller in the more metal - rich clusters m71 and 47 tuc in accord with the prediction the of agb ejecta models of @xcite . yet at the same time , if one presumes the highest [ c / fe ]  sgb / msto stars in m13 and m5 to represent the original ( accretion free ) c abundance of the cluster stars , they are still some 0.4 dex more c - poor than their 47 tuc / m71 counterparts , implying either truly primordial ( i.e. , pre - accretion ) differences in at least c or that nearly all the present stars in m13 and m5 have undergone at least some accretion of c - poor material . however",
    ", the spread in [ n / fe ]  is essentially identical among all four clusters . clearly ,",
    "knowledge of the patterns of [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] among the present stars would help constrain the agb ejecta theories .",
    "an interesting counterpoint to this model is the scenario suggested by @xcite and @xcite to explain similar results among m92 and m15 sgb stars  that the stars of these clusters were inhomogeneously `` polluted '' by an injection of raw c from intermediate mass agb stars which is subsequently converted into n in the present stars before sgb evolution thereby explaining both the c deficiencies and large n enhancements as well as star - to - star differences in ( c+n ) .",
    "this has the additional advantage of requiring considerably more modest composition modifications ( a factor of 4 or so in c from star to star ) , which in turn lowers the mass of captured ejecta required .",
    "however , to explain the large c depletions already in place by the msto , significant processing of the envelope through a region of cn - cycling must have taken place while the stars occupied the ms .",
    "one then returns to the difficulty of mixing in such stars discussed above .",
    "another site of the proton - capture reactions has recently been suggested by @xcite , who note that the high mass ( 250 - 300 @xmath21 ) zero metallicity models of @xcite tend to mix he and he - burning products into their h - burning shells during the later stages of he - burning .",
    "this fresh c , n , o is partially processed into n while at the same time , the stars expand into red supergiants .",
    "if mass loss also occurs at this point , the cluster could be seeded with freshly produced c / o - poor , n - rich material .",
    "such a scenario is presented within the context of the cluster formation history of  that the gcs formed from primordial material ( zero - metal ) that was subsequently enriched by the supernovae of massive stars before low mass stars could form .",
    "however , the problem remains that the production / seeding and mixing of the heavy - elements must be decoupled from that of the light - elements in order to explain the remarkable homogeneity of fe , ti , ca , etc . within the gcs . in the context of gc formation in a well mixed supershell ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this is difficult to explain if the cno - modified material is ejected prior to the driving supernovae and subsequent supershell expansion / mixing .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "we also wish to express our thanks to roger bell whose ssg code was instrumental in this project and the anonymous referee for their suggestions .",
