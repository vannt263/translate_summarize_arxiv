    "some very famous results of one dimensional dynamics state that a continuous map of the interval which has a periodic point of period 3 has periodic points of all other periods @xcite and positive topological entropy @xcite .",
    "these results are certainly not true in higher dimensions ; a rotation by @xmath3 in the disc @xmath1 has periodic points of period 3 and 1 only and topological entropy zero .",
    "in fact the period alone is not enough to specify a periodic orbit of a surface s homeomorphism @xmath0 in order to get information about the structure of the set of periodic points of @xmath0 .",

    "this idea has since been formalized by boyland @xcite who introduced the ` braid type ' of a periodic orbit .",

    "recently several authors @xcite have characterized all the braid types which appear for diffeomorphisms of genus zero surfaces with topological entropy zero .",
    "more recently , gambaudo , van strien and tresser @xcite have given an example of a braid type of period 3 in the disc which imply all other periods and positive topological entropy , which is the exact analogue of the result in one dimensional dynamics stated previously .",
    "in this paper we show that this is a quite general result , namely :    [ main_theorem ] if @xmath0 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the disc @xmath1 which has a periodic point @xmath13 of period 3 , then either @xmath0 is isotopic to a homeomorphism @xmath2 which is conjugate to a rotation by @xmath3 or @xmath4 or @xmath0 has periodic points of least period @xmath6 for each @xmath7 .    in short terms",
