    "the compelling evidence for non - baryonic dark matter has motivated a vast literature on possible dark matter candidates .",
    "successful models must lead to the correct relic density , as required , for example , by the observed rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "however , depending on what other phenomena one wishes to explain by the presence of dark matter , the details of viable scenarios can differ substantially from model to model . in the present work ,",
    "the phenomena we will attribute to the presence of dark matter is the striking rise in the cosmic ray positron fraction , from approximately @xmath0 to @xmath1  gev observed in the pamela experiment  @xcite and the apparent excess in the total electron and positron flux , up to about @xmath2  tev , as measured by fermi - lat  @xcite and h.e.s.s .  @xcite .",
    "while the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predicted backgrounds might have a purely astrophysical origin ( for example , if nearby pulsars are present  @xcite ) , dark matter annihilation  @xcite or decays  @xcite can also provide a source for the excess electron and positron flux .",
    "( a recent review of the literature can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in models with dark matter that is not exactly stable , fits to the data suggest that the dark matter must decay primarily to leptons and have a lifetime of @xmath3  s.    among the many interesting proposals for dark matter candidates in the recent literature is one in which a pseudo - majoron is identified as the dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "the majoron is a goldstone boson of spontaneously broken lepton number and the pseudo - majoron is the pseudo - goldstone boson that is obtained when the same spontaneously broken global symmetry is also explicitly broken by a small amount . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the explicit breaking is accomplished via soft terms in the scalar potential , and the sense in which this breaking is small is that the mass scale of these terms is much smaller than the scale at which lepton number is spontaneously broken .",
    "although the majoron can decay to standard model neutrinos , the lifetime is extremely long , due to the high - scale associated with the breaking of the global symmetry .",
    "while we will argue that the soft symmetry - breaking terms assumed in the original pseudo - majoron proposal do not lead to a viable model , we also show how this difficulty can be overcome .",
    "hence , the majoron can serve as a dark matter candidate and perhaps also provide detectable signals in neutrino telescopes .    the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , is not one which can account for the cosmic ray electron and positron excess . here",
    ", we will show that it is possible to construct a similar model in which the dark matter candidate is also the pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken approximate global symmetry , but one which leads to couplings of the dark matter candidate to charged leptons rather than neutrinos . unlike lepton number ( which treats all generations of leptons identically )",
    "our global symmetry will not .",
    "hence , the dark matter candidate that we propose here is technically a pseudo - familon , at least as far as the lepton sector is concerned .",
    "the model we discuss in the next sections provides an existence proof that pseudo - familon dark matter is a viable possibility that can accommodate the cosmic ray data .",
    "we assume the existence of global symmetry @xmath4 that acts nontrivially in lepton generation space .",
    "the charge assignments of the fields are summarized in table  [ table : one ] .",
    ".charge assignments under the u(1 ) global symmetry .",
    "the superscripts indicated generation number . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that the global symmetry distinguishes charged leptons of the third generation from those of the other two .",
    "the complex scalar field @xmath5 has charge @xmath6 and its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) completely breaks the symmetry @xmath7 the standard model higgs doublet @xmath8 is neutral under @xmath9 and plays its conventional role in electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of fermion masses .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry leads to a goldstone boson @xmath10 , which we shall identify via the conventional nonlinear field redefinition @xmath11 \\,\\,\\ ,   , \\label{eq : nonlin}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",
    "we will show that when one includes an appropriate set of terms that softly break @xmath9 , the familon @xmath10 becomes massive and can annihilate via couplings that are not suppressed by the scale @xmath13 ; regions of the model parameter space exist where the familon is sufficiently long lived and has the necessary relic density to be a viable dark matter candidate .    before proceeding to evaluate the model that we have just defined ,",
    "it is worth clarifying some of the underlying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume the existence of a global symmetry .",
    "while such symmetries can be violated by generic quantum gravitational effects , it is also true that they can arise accidentally in low - energy effective theories as a consequence of the gauge symmetries in an ultraviolet completion .",
    "hence , as in the majoron model of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is reasonable to consider the consequences of relatively simple global symmetries below the planck scale that lead to interesting phenomenology .",
    "secondly , we employ the term familon since our global symmetry @xmath9 acts nontrivially in lepton generation space .",
    "this does not imply , however , that @xmath9 is intended to provide a complete understanding of fermion yukawa textures by itself .",
    "instead , we require that @xmath9 not restrict the lepton yukawa textures too severely , so that the present construction is compatible with a wide range of possible flavor models ; these may introduce additional symmetries in generation space . finally , the model we present is non - supersymmetric , as a matter of convenience .",
    "possible solutions to the problem of fine - tuning in theories with fundamental scalars are well known , but are largely independent of the issues that we consider here . depending on what we learn from the large hadron collider , one can modify the model accordingly .",
    "the symmetry @xmath9 partly restricts the lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "the charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath14 , defined by @xmath15 indicates that @xmath14 must have the global charges @xmath16 the entries with non - vanishing charges arise via higher - dimension operators , so that at lowest order @xmath17 where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coefficients that are at most @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the lepton flavor scale , the scale at which the higher - dimension operators are generated .",
    "this form clearly can parametrically accommodate the charged lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "however , one can do better : the breaking of additional symmetries can provide an explanation for the charged lepton mass hierarchy .",
    "for example , consider a @xmath22 flavor symmetry under which the three generations of right - handed charged leptons transform as @xmath23 , for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "then given a flavon field @xmath26 , one would find instead @xmath27 assuming @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is of order the cabibbo angle , one obtains the viable charged lepton yukawa texture @xmath30 and the @xmath31 coupling @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "note that the vanishing entries in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmatrix ] ) are not corrected at higher order . since the diagonal blocks of eq .",
    "( [ eq : texture ] ) are neutral under @xmath9 , any higher - order corrections to these entries that involve @xmath5 must do so via the product @xmath34 , which is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "note also that the matrices in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : texture ] ) and ( [ eq : cmatrix ] ) are not proportional to each other and can not be diagonalized simultaneously . due to the extreme smallness of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 rotation angles required to diagonalize @xmath14 ,",
    "one finds that the largest entries of the familon coupling matrix are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmatrix ] ) , though generally with different order - one coefficients . in the mass eigenstate basis",
    ", one finds @xmath37 where we have only retained order - one coefficients @xmath38 for the non - negligible terms .",
    "the @xmath10 decays are lepton flavor violating ; the leading decay channels are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the dark matter lifetime of @xmath43  s is obtained when the operator coefficient satisfies @xmath44 which implies @xmath45  gev , up to order one uncertainty .",
    "we will take @xmath46 , the reduced planck mass , henceforth .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the scale @xmath21 could arise via renormalizable physics , for example , the integrating - out of vector - like fermions with masses just below @xmath47 .    in the pseudo - majoron dark matter model",
    ", the majoron decay amplitude is proportional to neutrino masses , which accounts for the longevity of the dark matter candidate .",
    "one might naively expect that a generic familon in the charged lepton sector would decay too quickly , due to the much larger charged lepton masses , to be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "the crucial feature of the model we have presented is that our familon couplings are proportional to _ off - diagonal _ elements of the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "these elements can be arbitrarily small , leading to the long dark matter lifetime required by the cosmic ray data .",
    "neutrino masses in the model arise via the see - saw mechanism .",
    "the dirac and majorana mass terms are defined by @xmath48 the entries of @xmath49 have the global charges @xmath50 and hence arise all at the same order @xmath51 ; we may therefore write @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an arbitrary matrix with order - one entries . the matrix @xmath54 is not restricted at all by @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the flavor structure of the neutrino sector is largely unconstrained and can be chosen to accommodate the data .",
    "on the other hand , the overall light neutrino mass scale , @xmath55 , follows from the seesaw formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 characterizes the right - handed neutrino mass scale .",
    "choosing @xmath58 ( which is compatible with the data on atmospheric neutrino oscillations  @xcite ) , one finds @xmath59  tev . this scale is high enough so that the see - saw formula is an accurate approximation and the heavy , right - handed neutrino mass eigenstates present no phenomenological problems",
    "let us first consider the u(1 ) invariant portion of the scalar sector of the theory .",
    "imagine we employ the linear decomposition @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the massless degree of freedom .",
    "let @xmath8 represent the standard model higgs doublet , and @xmath62 the higgs boson . in the pseudo - majoron model of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the coupling @xmath63 leads to interactions of the form @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 . since these are the standard higgs portal couplings for a scalar dark matter candidate , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the appropriate relic density could readily be achieved .",
    "this argument , however , is not correct . using the nonlinear redefinition of @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlin ] ) , one notices that the u(1 ) invariant @xmath34 is independent of the goldstone mode @xmath10 ; hence , one concludes using this representation that there are _ no _ couplings of @xmath10 to @xmath62 that are unsuppressed by the scale @xmath13 . both the linear and non - linear representations of the goldstone boson , however , should lead to the same physical results .",
    "this puzzle can be resolved in the linear theory by carefully evaluating the scalar couplings in the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "for example , one finds couplings of the form @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is ( mostly ) a super - heavy scalar state with mass of order @xmath13 .",
    "one can not simply neglect the coupling to @xmath69 : there is mixing between @xmath62 and @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the higgs mass eigenstate .",
    "thus , one finds _ two _ contributions to the @xmath73 vertex , each with a coefficient of @xmath74 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that they cancel , up to corrections of @xmath75 .",
    "the absence of couplings that are unsuppressed by the high scale @xmath13 implies that one can not achieve a sufficient annihilation cross section via the couplings in the u(1 ) invariant sector of the theory .",
    "the previous observations suggest that the desired higgs - portal couplings must arise in the soft - symmetry breaking sector of the theory . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the global symmetry is an approximate one due to the existence of renormalizable interactions with mass dimension three or less that explicitly break the symmetry .",
    "such interactions must provide for an adequate dark matter mass and annihilation cross section , while not leading to rapid dark matter decays . to obtain the dark matter mass scale that is suggested by the cosmic - ray data , we take the new dimensionful couplings to be tev - scale in size .",
    "the familon @xmath10 is nonetheless correctly categorized as a pseudo - goldstone boson since the ratio of the scales of explicit to spontaneous symmetry breaking is small , @xmath76 .",
    "the simplest way to allow for unsuppressed couplings that lead to dark matter annihilation is to introduce a real scalar singlet @xmath77 and the cp - invariant symmetry - breaking terms @xmath78 one may consistently impose a @xmath79 symmetry that eliminates soft terms that are odd in @xmath5 , while allowing all the other lagrangian terms that we have considered thus far .",
    "note that @xmath80 can always be made real by a global u(1 ) rotation , while @xmath81 is taken real as a parameter choice ; this satisfies ",
    "t hooft s criterion for technical naturalness since the scalar sector then has an enhanced symmetry , namely a @xmath79 where @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that the scalar - sector interactions involve only even powers of pseudo - goldstone boson field and therefore do not introduce an avenue for rapid decays   couplings which violate this @xmath79 .",
    "however , these decays can be neglected since their branching fractions are loop suppressed relative to the leading modes discussed earlier . ] .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath81 includes the interaction @xmath83 , where @xmath84 represents the fluctuation of the singlet about its vev .",
    "provided that the necessary tunings of dimensionful couplings are employed so that the scalar @xmath84 and the higgs field @xmath62 are light , then the low - energy effective theory will contain the terms @xmath85 where the dimensionful parameters shown are tev - scale in size .",
    "generically , @xmath84 and @xmath62 will mix , so that the familon can annihilate to standard model particles via the @xmath86-channel exchanges of both mass eigenstates .",
    "a complete study of the allowed parameters space that yields the correct relic density is beyond the scope of his letter ( a detailed study of a similar sector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we will focus on a well motivated limit : for a higgs boson that is very similar to that of the standard model , the @xmath62-@xmath84 mixing should be small . if the singlet is an order of magnitude heavier than the higgs ( _ i.e. _ , similar in mass to the familon ) , then we would expect this to be a reasonable approximation . with mixing effects neglected",
    ", one sees that the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effv ] ) nonetheless lead to the dark matter annihilation channel @xmath87 , via @xmath86-channel exchanges of the singlet @xmath84 .",
    "the annihilation cross section is given by @xmath88^{1/2 } \\frac{m_2 ^ 2 \\",

    "this example demonstrates that there are regions of the full parameters space of the model where the appropriate dark matter relic density can easily be obtained .",
    "the branching fractions for the leading familon decay channels are determined by the couplings @xmath102 and @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmbasis ] ) , i.e. , @xmath104 + \\mbox { h.c . }   \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , and are given by @xmath106 since the total must sum to one , we can parameterize eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfs ] ) in terms of the branching fraction to @xmath41 : @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",
    "hence the dark matter mass @xmath110 , lifetime @xmath111 and the value of the parameter @xmath112 determines the contribution from dark matter decays to the cosmic ray spectra .",
    "we compute the energy distribution of cosmic ray electrons or positrons using pythia 6.4  @xcite ; when more than one decay channel is possible @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the energy spectrum obtained given the primary decay @xmath115 , with the subscript indicating lepton flavor .",
    "the energy spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : totenspec ] ) is then input into a standard diffusive model for propagation of electrons and positrons through the interstellar medium .",
    "this analysis is now standard to the literature on decaying dark matter and the details , including our assumptions on background fluxes , are identical to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we refer the reader to this reference for a detailed discussion .",
    "an example of typical results that can be obtained in the model are shown in fig .",

    "we have shown that the breaking of a global symmetry that acts nontrivially in lepton generation space can lead to a viable dark matter candidate that does decay primarily to charged leptons .",
    "the long lifetime of the pseudo - familon dark matter candidate in the model we have proposed is related to the smallness of off - diagonal entries in the charged lepton yukawa matrices ; no phenomenological consideration prevents these entries from being small , an outcome that is realized due to the symmetries , charge assignments and the choice of mass scales in our model .",
    "we have argued that unsuppressed higgs - portal couplings can arise via soft symmetry - breaking terms involving a gauge singlet scalar , so that the correct pseudo - familon relic density can be achieved .",
