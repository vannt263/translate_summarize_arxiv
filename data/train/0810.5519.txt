    "already in early days of the tunneling spectroscopy it has been shown that magnetic field @xmath1 ( which couples to spin of the charge carriers ) is in superconductors responsible for splitting the square root singularities of the tunneling conductance @xcite by the zeeman energy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bohr magneton .",
    "this meservey - tedrow - fulde ( mtf ) effect has been observed experimentally in the thin superconducting aluminum films applying parallel magnetic field so that orbital diamagnetic effects could be avoided .",
    "similar qualitative results have been recently noticed in the measurements of @xmath4-axis tunneling for the layered high temperature superconducting compounds @xcite .",
    "we argue that the mtf effect should be also feasible in various nanostructures consisting of a quantum dot ( qd ) placed between one metallic and one superconducting electrode .",
    "zero - dimensional character of qds in a natural way eliminates the influence of orbital effects therefore magnetic field would affect the charge transport only through the zeeman term .",
    "this can in turn manifest itself in the differential conductance .",
    "roughly speaking , the charge current flows if an external bias @xmath5 exceeds the energy gap @xmath6 ( necessary to break the cooper pairs into individual electrons ) thereof the resulting conductance has a low voltage onset near the gap edges @xmath7 . in presence of a magnetic field",
    "these gap edge singularities are going to split ( see section iii ) .",
    "more detailed analysis of the charge tunneling @xcite involves however also the additional ( anomalous ) channels due to mixing of the particle and hole excitations in superconductors . in particular , even at subgap voltages @xmath8 the mechanism of andreev reflections provides a finite contribution to the conductance .",
    "since the andreev mechanism is very sensitive to location of the in - gap qd states @xcite and the on - dot correlations @xcite we shall explore the influence of magnetic field on such subgap conductance . in section",
    "iv we discuss a hyperfine structure for the andreev conductance neglecting the correlations . in the next section",
    "v we extend our study taking into account a finite value of the on - dot repulsion @xmath9 .",
    "we show that appearance of the low temperature kondo resonance enhances the zero bias conductance and this feature undergoes the zeeman splitting when magnetic field is applied .    as concerns some practical aspects ,",
    "there have been considered the proposals for using the magnetic field tuned andreev scattering as an efficient cooling mechanism in two dimensional electron gas - superconductor nanostructure @xcite . there is also considered a possibility to use the , so called , andreev quantum dot as a magnetic flux detector @xcite .",
    "for a general description of transport phenomena through a nanoscopic island placed between external leads one should consider a quantized multilevel structure of qd @xcite . however , in the case when a level spacing is smaller in comparison to qd hybridization with the electrodes one can restrict to a simplified picture of the anderson model @xcite @xmath10 operators @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) denote the annihilation ( creation ) of electron whose energy level is @xmath13 and @xmath9 is the on - dot coulomb repulsion between opposite spin electrons .",

    "tanaka and coworkers @xcite were able to rigorously prove that the selfenergy @xmath83 must have a diagonal structure due to invariance of @xmath84 term on the bogoliubov - valatin transformation .    in the remaining part of this section we shall focus on the subgap andreev current transmitted through the correlated qd .",

    "the latter one is related to screening of the quantum dot spin by itinerant electrons of the metallic lead . in the case",
    "when energy level @xmath55 is located slightly below @xmath92 the hybridization @xmath93 induces effectively antiferromagnetic interaction between the qd and metallic lead . in consequence",
    "the bound singlet state can be formed giving rise to the resonance at @xmath94 for temperatures @xmath95 . magnetic field eventually splits this resonance as illustrated in figure [ kondo_peak ] .",
    "any features present in the qd spectrum are further showing up in the measurable differential conductance .",
    "this is also valid for the kondo resonance .",
    "since it forms near the chemical potential @xmath92 therefore its signatures appear predominantly in the low voltage current .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that kondo resonance enhances at low temperatures the zero bias andreev conductance @xcite , however its magnitude remains much smaller than the unitary limit value @xmath96 typical for n - qd - n systems in the kondo regime . in the present context we emphasize that magnetic field enforces the zeeman splitting of the zero bias andreev anomaly in much the same way as it affects the zero bias anomaly for the qd coupled to both metallic leads @xcite .    the zero bias enhancement of the andreev conductance is a feature whose presence might be difficult to notice @xcite unless some stringent requirements are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "it turns out that optimal conditions for the low temperature enhancement of @xmath97 take place when @xmath64 is comparable to @xmath71 ( see figure [ opt_conditions ] ) and @xmath55 is located slightly below the energy gap center . for an increasing asymmetry between the hybridizations @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath64 the magnitude of low voltage andreev conductance diminishes ( similarly as we have been shown in section iv upon neglecting the correlations ) . on the other hand , for @xmath55 moving far aside from the superconductor s gap center",
    "the proximity effect becomes weakened and the overall andreev conductance is again suppressed .",
    "in general it seems that an interplay between the on - dot pairing ( absorbed from the superconducting electrode ) and the kondo state ( due to screening of qd spin by the metallic lead electrons ) has the same character as a competition of superconductivity versus magnetism in the solid state physics .",
    "since this is outside the main scope of the present topic we shall discuss it separately @xcite .",
    "a combination of the kondo physics , superconductivity and the zeeman polarization is a complex problem and to our knowledge only few papers have so far attempted to address this challenging issue @xcite .",
    "we have explored the effect of magnetic field on charge transport through the quantum dot attached to one normal and one superconducting electrode . for a bias voltage @xmath98",
    "we find the zeeman splitting of the square root singularities in the differential conductance .",
    "this resembles the experimental result of meservey , tedrow and fulde observed in the n - i - s junction @xcite which for the n - qd - s structures it seems rather easy to achieve .",
    "we have extended our study also on the in - gap andreev current . due to the proximity effect",
    "the particles and holes of the quantum dot get mixed and effectively the spectrum acquires the bcs - like structure ( [ rho_ingap ] ) .",
    "differential conductance @xmath99 of the in - gap current indirectly probes such structure of the bound andreev states .",
    "we have shown that magnetic field leads to appearance of four peaks via the combined particle - hole and zeeman splittings .",
    "we hope that this result might stimulate a search for the experimental detection of above mentioned structures .",
    "moreover , we have explored influence of the on - dot coulomb interactions on the subgap andreev current assuming the extreme limit @xmath80 . in general , the on - dot correlations contribute to the qd spectrum : ( i ) appearance of the coulomb satellite near @xmath100 ( charging effect ) , and ( ii ) at sufficiently low temperatures can produce the narrow kondo resonance at the chemical potential @xmath92 .",
    "magnetic field imposes the hyperfine splitting onto such spectrum in a similar way as has been observed in n - qd - n junctions @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect alone is exemplified in the zero bias andreev conductance where under appropriate conditions @xcite a low temperature enhancement can be seen if @xmath101 and the gate voltage tunes @xmath55 nearly to the energy gap center .",
    "it would be of interest to use some more sophisticated methods for treating the on - dot interaction @xmath9 in order to check whether there exist a minimal magnetic field necessary for splitting the kondo peak ( as theoretically predicted for n - qd - n junctions @xcite ) observable in the andreev conductance .",
    "one can also study qd coupled with @xmath102-wave superconductor , where the square root singularities are replaced by weaker kinks .",
    "we think that the meservey - tedrow - fulde effect would be observable there too ( but in a less pronounced manner ) whereas the subgap conductance might qualitatively change .",
