    "absorption spectra of interstellar clouds contain wellknown molecular bands of simple polar radicals , ch , cn , ch@xmath1 which have been discovered and identified long ago @xcite . for a long period",
    "they were believed to be the only possible interstellar molecules . in 1970-ties small homonuclear molecules ( h@xmath2 , c@xmath2 )",
    "were also found . at the same time",
    ", rotational emission features revealed the presence ( specifically in the dense ism , mostly in starforming regions ) of many complex molecules with a dipole momentum ; the full list of these polar species ( mostly carbonbearing ) currently counts more than 190 entries , clearly demonstrating that a rich chemistry , mostly carbonbased , takes place in interstellar clouds .",
    "some of these species have recently been observed in the middle and far infrared by the space telescope herschel .",
    "the largest currently known interstellar molecules are the fullerenes c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 @xcite . yet",
    "unknown ( unidentified ) molecular species are believed to be the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) : these make up the longest standing unsolved problem in astronomical spectroscopy .",
    "the first two dibs were discovered in 1921 by @xcite . until 1970 the list of dibs was very short  only 9 entries .",
    "the application of solid state detectors and more powerful telescopes to dib observations led to the progressive discovery of many additional weak features , almost all of them in the range from the nearuv to the nearir .",
    "the current lists of known dibs contain over 400 entries @xcite , the majority of them is very shallow .",
    "some of the weaker features are not unambiguously detected and classified as dibs in all surveys , e.g. @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , fine structures  reminiscent in some cases of the unresolved rotational envelopes of bands of polyatomic molecules  have been resolved in some dibs @xcite .",
    "nearly all conceivable forms of matter , from the hydrogen anion to color centres in dust grains , have already been proposed as dib carriers .",
    "all of them have been rejected , with very few still tentative exceptions .",
    "recently @xcite found a very weak dib which coincides with an electronic , gasphase band of hc@xmath5h@xmath1 , supporting the molecular dib origin .",
    "another coincidence between a lifetimebroadened absorption spectrum recorded through a hydrocarbon plasma and a strong dib at 545  nm was reported by @xcite , but an unambiguous identification of the carrier has not yet been possible .",
    "lc@xmath6h@xmath2 was initially proposed by @xcite but this identification would imply this species to be surprisingly abundant in the ism ; moreover , another broad dib , initially interpreted as a second lc@xmath6h@xmath2 feature ( from the same level ) near 4883 , clearly has a different origin @xcite .",
    "two strong dibs in the nearir were tentatively attributed to c@xmath7 by @xcite on the basis of laboratory spectra measured in solid raregas matrices , but this was disputed by @xcite and @xcite . despite the recent detection of the vibrational spectrum of c@xmath7 @xcite , its identification or rejection as dib carrier still awaits gasphase laboratory spectra , as yet unavailable .",
    "similarly , @xcite recently claimed the identification of electronic transitions of gasphase singly charged naphthalene , the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) in the spectra of cernis  52 and , more recently , of hd  125241 .",
    "in cernis  52 a welldefined band is firmly detected , which is consistent with the strongest band of c@xmath8h@xmath9 .",
    "other , weaker bands are compatible with observations , but their presence is not as firmly established , mainly due to stellar line contamination . in the case of hd  125241 , the authors may have been misled by the fact that the spectrum of this star is populated with many stellar emission lines , possibly of circumstellar origin .",
    "one of them , centered at 6701.2    and due to siiv , is very broad . setting the continuum over the red wing of this emission",
    "can easily have created a broad depression as an artifact , where the authors identify the strongest naphthalene band .",
    "this was never confirmed in any other sources , nor any other features of this molecule have been firmly identified yet on the same source , being at best weak features superimposed on stronger stellar features contaminating them . @xcite also claimed the identification of a band of the anthracene cation ( c@xmath10h@xmath11 ) in the spectrum of cernis  52 .",
    "however , this one band is obtained after subtraction of a stronger , very close , overlapping stellar feature , and no other bands of c@xmath10h@xmath11 were detected .",
    "it was furthermore rebutted by @xcite , so that this claimed identification must be regarded as tentative .",
    "no other specific pah features were found , despite several dedicated efforts ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",

    "the redshift of the dibs at 4502 , 5705 , 5780 , 6284 , and 7224    observed in hd  37022 can be interpreted in two different ways : either the peculiar physical conditions along , or around , hd  37022 produce _ intrinsically _ different dib profiles , broader and peaking at a different position , or the observed dibs are produced by doppler structure , as possibly hinted by all shifted dibs sharing ( or compatible with ) the same redshift and broadening in velocity scale .    to test the feasibility of this latter hypothesis , we attempted a conditioned leastsquares fit of the redshifted 5780 and 6284    dibs in hd  37022 with a superposition of two `` template '' dibs , namely the ones observed in hd  24398 . therefore , the dib as observed in hd  24398 was assumed as the `` intrinsic '' profile , and several copies of it with different scalings and doppler shifts were used to fit the profile observed in hd  37022 .",
    "the fit was constrained to only two doppler components , one fixed at the doppler velocity of the nai lines , the other free to vary .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are therefore only three ( for each dib ) : the two intensities of the components ( constrained to be positive ) and the doppler velocity of the redshifted component .",
    "we used the wellknown levembergmarquardt method @xcite , as implemented in the mpfit package @xcite for idl .",
    "this algorithm strives to numerically reduce the @xmath12 computed between model and data , iteratively modifying an initial guess for the values of the free parameters , until a minimum is found .",
    "it is therefore possible to fall into local minima , especially with noisy data , and the solution found will in this case depend on the initial starting point .",
    "when several minima exist , they will normally have different @xmath12 values , and some may be rejected on the sole basis of this .",
    "however , it may happen that more than one solution has an acceptable @xmath12 value ; in this case , some of these may be rejected because the residual ( difference between model and data ) is clearly not white noise , i.  e. with the model falling systematically below the data in some section of the spectrum and above it in another .",
    "this indeed happens with our fit here , with several solutions being in principle acceptable on the basis of @xmath12 alone , but with only the best one ( i.e. the one with the absolute minimum @xmath12 value ) producing a residual of white noise , with uncorrelated adjacent values . to make the determination of the acceptable fit more robust and less subjective",
    ", we filtered both the hd  37022 and the template dibs with a mild smoothing filter ( fourier 5 points filter as implemented in the dech data reduction suite ) .",
    "this is justified by the fact that harpsn spectra are oversampled and the dibs being fitted are intrinsically rather broad .",
    "when using the filtered data , only one acceptable solution is found , which corresponds to the absolute minimum of @xmath12 , while the unphysical ones are not even local minima any more .",
    "the resulting , very satisfactory best fits for the 5780 and the 6284    dibs are shown in figs .",
    "[ fit5780 ] and [ fit6284 ] .        .",
    "the radial velocity difference is the same , namely 35  km / s . ]    , for the 6284    dib .",
    "the radial velocity difference between the two components is the same , namely 35  km / s .",
    "note the presence , only in hd  24398 , of the narrow 6287 dib . ]    .",
    "the radial velocity difference is the same , namely 35  km / s . ]    in both cases , the residual between the fit and the original spectrum is essentially white noise , except for the obvious absence of the narrow dib at 6287    in hd  37022 , which is instead present in the reference hd  24398 spectrum and thus appears as an artifact in the residual in fig .",
    "[ fit6284 ] .",
    "when slightly smoothed spectra are used for the fit , the solution is very robust for both the 5780 and 6284    dibs , and in both cases the additional fitted component results to be redshifted with respect to interstellar sodium by 34  km / s  @xmath13  40  km / s , the best solution being @xmath035  km / s . when the same fitting procedure is applied to the 5780 and 6284    dibs in hd  37020 , due to lower s",
    "/ n the solution is not unique even after smoothing , but all acceptable solutions yield nonetheless 34  km / s  @xmath13  40  km / s for the radial velocity of the additional component , consistent with what was found for hd  37022 .",
    "these results can be compared to the radial velocity shifts listed in table  [ rv_shifts ] . however , since the latter were determined by correlation with a template consisting of a single component , for a meaningful comparison one must compare them with the weighted average of the radial velocities of the two components of the fit performed here , the weights being their relative intensities .",
    "this results in very nearly the same numbers of table  [ rv_shifts ] for the dibs at 5780 and 6284   .",
    "the noise in the other dibs in hd  37022 and hd  37020 is so high that the fits are not robust ( i.  e. many equivalently acceptable fit solutions are found ) but they are compatible with the results found for the 5780 and 6284    dibs ( i.  e. @xmath14  km / s is always one of the acceptable solutions of the fit ) .",
    "therefore , while of course we do not claim that this is the only possible interpretation of the data , we do find it to be possible and selfconsistent .",
    "of course , this then raises more questions : what is producing the redshifted component of the dibs ? some residual , still infalling material of the young , newlyformed , very earlytype stars ? or do they arise in the evaporating layer of the pdr , at the edge of the hii region ? and why is this additional doppler component not detected in atomic lines ? upon comparing the doppler structures of the nai and caii lines in fig .",
    "[ atom_doppler ] and table  [ atomic_radvel_table ] , there appears to be a temperature gradient with increasing radial velocities , whereby nai lines decrease while caii increases , and the highest velocity component is detected only in caii , but weaker .",
    "there may therefore be another , more redshifted component with a still higher temperature , in which thus sodium and singly ionized calcium are absent , but this is a long stretch with the available data .",
    "observations with a substantially higher s / n ratio would enable us to perform a robust fit on the other three redshifted dibs :",
    "it is clear that if 5 different dibs were _ robustly _ consistent with _ the same _ doppler structure , yielding the same radial velocity as the only acceptable fit for the additional component of all of them , this would provide rather solid evidence for this interpretation .",
    "conversely , if each dib were found to require a different radial velocity structure , this would make this interpretation just a pointless mathematical exercise .",
    "furthermore , a substantially higher s / n ratio might also enable us to detect either additional doppler components in sodium and calcium lines , or weak molecular features ( ch , ch@xmath1 , cn ) , which are below the detection limit in current data . this would be extremely interesting also because there is some observational evidence that e.  g. ch , ch@xmath1 and cn features do not always show all the same doppler components , with ch@xmath1 features sometimes shifted with respect to the other species and to atomic lines ( see e.  g. * ? ? ? * ) .    as to the other possible interpretation , i.  e. different intrinsic profiles of the redshifted dibs in hd  37022 ,",
    "this is tempting in the light of the recent observations in herschel  36 @xcite . in this extremely peculiar line of sight , ch and ch@xmath1",
    "were observed to have an anomalously high rotational temperature , and some dibs were simultaneously found to be anomalously broad ( much more than what we observe here ) , with a very wide red wing , and the peaks of some of them slightly redshifted ( less than what we observe here ) .",
    "this has been tentatively interpreted as unresolved rotational envelopes of molecular bands , which in herschel  36 appear to have an anomalously high rotational excitation .",
    "if this were the correct interpretation for hd  37022 , then this would be an intermediate case between the `` standard '' excitation conditions of the cold neutral ism , where `` normal '' dibs arise , and those prevailing in herschel 36 .",
    "however , the dib at 5797    is prominent , and prominently broadened , in herschel  36 , and instead is undetectable in hd  37022 ; also , the 6196    dib is one of the broadened ones in herschel  36 , while no such effect is evident in our data of hd  37022 ( but _ some limited _ broadening might be consistent with our observations , hidden by the noise ) .",
    "also , the 6284    dib is broadened but not redshifted in herschel  36 , while it _ is _ redshifted in hd  37022 . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "again it would be useful to obtain deeper observations with higher s / n , to detect ch , ch@xmath1 and cn features , determine their rotational temperatures in hd  37022 and explore their relations with the observed profiles and positions of redshifted dibs .",
    "we remark that hd  37022 and herschel  36 also have rather peculiar extinction curves @xcite , hinting that dust properties are also unusual .",
    "actually , herschel  36 appears to be a tight triple system @xcite .",
    "@xcite give for it the spectral classification of the third , most luminous , o  7.5  v type star of the system , which certainly dominates the iue spectrum they used to derive the extinction .",
    "the spectrum in the visible , in which the peculiar dibs were observed , contains nonnegligible contributions from all three unresolved stars . in any case ,",
    "the extinction curve and dibs are very likely to be extremely similar for all three stars of such a close system , unless circumstellar material makes a large contribution to them .",

    "figure  [ extinctioncurvesref ] , for comparison , shows the extinction curve of hd  23180 ( @xmath16  per ) , the closest proxy of hd  24398 ( @xmath17  per ) available in the sample of @xcite , and the average galactic one .",
    "the macroscopic dust component appears to be very similar for all the three stars in fig .",
    "[ extinctioncurves ] , all very different from the reference ones in fig .",
    "[ extinctioncurvesref ] . upon examining tables  4 and 5 in @xcite",
    ", one sees that in all three cases , upon comparison with the galactic average and hd  23180 , the dust population is dominated by large silicatic grains , covered by a thick mantle of heavily processed ( entirely , or almost entirely , aromatic ) carbonaceous material .",
    "pahs are very underabundant in all of them with respect to the reference ones , similar to the galactic average . in the evolutionary scenario put forward by @xcite ,",
    "all three lines of sight appear to be composed of `` old '' , heavily processed dust .",
    "it is unclear whether both dibs and the extinction curves are made peculiar by some common physical cause related to the environment , or if dibs may be altered due to particular dust properties .",
    "red shift and broadening in molecular electronic bands are commonly caused by attachment of molecules to a solid substrate ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "in an environment apparently devoid of small dust particles and pahs @xcite , in which apparently smaller nanograins and macromolecules are either destroyed or coalesce onto larger ones , possibly some dib carriers can also partially attach to grain surfaces , producing what we observe in hd  37022 .",
    "clearly a strategy to pursue to try to find the cause of the red shift of some dibs in hd  37022 , besides obtaining better observations of hd  37022 and valid regardless of the interpretation , would be to find other similar cases , in order to understand what they have in common and thus what makes them different from the `` standard '' ones .",
    "selecting lines of sight for further dib observations choosing the ones with peculiar extinction curves similar to that of hd  37022 @xcite might be a key in this respect .",

    "<S> the wavelength displacement of the diffuse interstellar bands at 4502 , 5705 , 5780 , 6284 , and 7224    with respect to the well known , narrow atomic / molecular interstellar lines ( of caii and nai ) have been measured in the spectra of the 2 orion trapezium stars hd  37022 and hd  37020 , using the harpsn spectrograph , fed with the 3.5  m telescopio nazionale galileo , and the boes spectrograph , fed with the 1.8 m korean telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift is @xmath025  km / s for all these dibs . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the various possible origins of this very peculiar wavelength shift in the light of the particular physical conditions in the orion trapezium . </S>",
    "<S> the above mentioned shift is seemingly absent in the dibs at 6196 and 6993   .    </S>",
