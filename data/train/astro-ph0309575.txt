    "phase - referencing has become a standard technique in very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) to measure accurate relative positions of radio sources .",
    "the concept of phase - referencing is based on the assumption that the phase errors of two sources with a small angular separation on the sky are similar .",
    "one observes a target source between two scans on a calibrator .",
    "then one can interpolate the calibration between the two scans and apply this interpolated phase corrections to the phase of the target source .",
    "the phase - referenced difference phase contains information only about the target source structure and its position relative to the calibrator and contains noise from interpolation errors .",
    "one major problem of phase - referencing vlbi observations is the unknown tropospheric zenith delay at each antenna .",
    "the vlba correlator model uses a seasonally averaged and latitude - dependent atmospheric model  ( niell 1996 ) , which can misestimate the zenith delay by a few centimeters . the excess path length caused by the dry troposphere to a radio signal from a source with zenith angle @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total pressure at the surface ( see equation 13.41 in thompson , moran , & swenson 2001 )",
    ". this excess path length will be different for the calibrator and the target source since both sources usually have different zenith angles .",
    "hence , a residual error will remain after phase - referencing .",
    "these residual errors degrade the quality of the phase - referenced image and limit the achievable astrometric accuracy ( e.g. , beasley & conway 1995 ) .",
    "if the correlator model misestimates the zenith delay @xmath4 by 3 cm ( @xmath5 ns ) , one would expect after phase - referencing delay errors of 0.2 cm for zenith angles of @xmath6 and source separations of @xmath7 .",
    "however , these errors can be corrected if the true zenith delay at each antenna is known .",
    "the fringe - phase of the target source after phase - referencing is mainly a sum of the position offset and the effects of the zenith delay error if the source structure is negligible .",
    "the phase induced by the position offset shows a simple 24 hour cosine behavior , while the phase errors from the zenith delay error follow a more complex dependence on the zenith angle according to equation 1 . because of the different behavior of the two contributions , it is possible to separate both effects and to estimate the position offset as well as the zenith delay error .    one can compute a model phase with a position offset ( two parameters ) and a zenith delay error at each antenna ( one parameter for each antenna ) and perform a least - squares fit to the phase data",
    "this method has been applied successfully by reid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to measure the proper motion of sgr a@xmath8 . in brunthaler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we applied this method to phase - referencing observations of extragalactic h@xmath9o masers in ic10 with respect to the background quasar j0027 + 5958 and achieved an astrometric accuracy of @xmath10as .",
    ".positions offsets of ic10 in right ascension ( @xmath11 ) and declination ( @xmath12 ) relative to the phase center from the model fit to the phase data ( a ) , the corrected map using the phase data ( b ) and the corrected map using the geodetic - like observations ( c ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the fit values of the zenith delay and clock offsets can also be used to correct the _",
    "a corrected image is seen in figure  1  ( c ) and the peak - to - noise ratio is 100 .",
    "the positions of the maser feature in the corrected maps are given in table  1  ( c ) .",
    "they are also consistent with the positions of the fit to the phases .",
    "we have presented a technique to correct phase - referencing observations for inaccurate zenith delays in the vlba correlator model .",
    "the quality of the atmosphere - corrected phase - referenced images can be improved by this technique .",
    "the peak - to - noise ratio in the corrected images increases by @xmath13 . by using this technique , an astrometric accuracy of 10 @xmath0as can be achieved .",
    "two independent methods were presented to estimate the zenith delay offsets at each antenna .",
    "the images obtained from the correction with the zenith delay offsets from the fit to the phases ( fig.1  ( b ) ) and from the geodetic - like observations ( fig.1  ( c ) ) are very similar and the positions measured from these images are consistent .",
    "this is a proof of concept for our technique .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of this technique enables us to detect significant proper motions of galaxies in the local group out to a distance of 800 kpc within a few years .",
    "one needs at least three epochs of observations to make reliable statements about measured proper motions .",
    "further observations are underway and the results will be presented elsewhere .",
