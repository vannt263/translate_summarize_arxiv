    "measurements of the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite involve an extrapolation of @xmath4 for @xmath5 , which is usually performed by fitting a regge - motivated form @xmath6 to the experimental data points with the lowest @xmath1-values .",
    "this procedure can be problematic , since these data points are usually taken at a relatively low scale of @xmath7 , whereas the overall sum rule is evaluated at the average @xmath0 of the experiment , which is typically between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in the recent past , various authors have attempted to calculate the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath10 ( see for example ref .",

    "a non  perturbative calculation @xcite of the flavour singlet contribution to @xmath4 shows good agreement with @xmath12 at small @xmath1 , but it should be noted that the normalisation of this non  perturbative contribution is highly sensitive to the only approximately known value of the vacuum quark condensate .",
    "the experimental discrepancy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the small-@xmath1 region seems to contradict the above result .",
    "as the singlet distribution is identical for both targets , this discrepancy indicates a sizeable valence - quark contribution in this region .    with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "perturbative corrections become more and more important .",
    "these corrections affect both the valence and the singlet contributions ( @xmath14 ) to @xmath4 and give rise to an evolution of the corresponding parton densities @xcite @xmath15 without determining the densities themselves .",
    "these enter the above equation in the form of the initial distributions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which form the boundary conditions for the solution .    in experimental measurements ,",
    "these perturbative corrections are incorporated by rescaling the value of @xmath4 to the average @xmath0 of the experiment .",
    "this rescaling procedure relies on the assumption that the asymmetry @xmath19 satisfies exact bjorken scaling , i.e. that the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath4 coincides with that of @xmath20 .",
    "although this assumption is consistent with the present data ( which cover only a small range of @xmath0 values at fixed @xmath1 ) , there is no theoretical justification for it .",

    "while both the dotted and the dashed lines are computed with @xmath125 , the dot - dashed curve corresponds to full splitting function evolution for @xmath126 , i.e. a softer large-@xmath1 distribution . evidently there is a significant sensitivity to the behaviour at large @xmath1 even for @xmath1 values as small as @xmath127 .",
    "this casts doubt on the idea of using data on the evolution of the small-@xmath1 structure functions alone to determine the gluon distribution .    for the singlet quark distribution ( fig .",

    "this is readily understood from the behaviour of the corresponding @xmath99 and @xmath86 functions in fig .  2 , both of which are systematically more positive for the leading - pole splitting functions .",
    "in fact we see that for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the full evolution gives a negative singlet distribution at small @xmath1 , whereas the leading pole splitting functions give a positive distribution .",
    "notice also that the evolution is less sensitive to the large-@xmath1 behaviour ( compare the dashed and dot - dashed curves which correspond to @xmath130 respectively ) than for the gluon distribution . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the @xmath124 approximation is quite reasonable , and certainly better than the leading - pole approximation .",
    "however the opposite is true when both @xmath122 are close to @xmath109 .    finally , fig .",
    "4(c ) compares the valence quark evolution in the various approximations .",
    "this depends only on @xmath132 , and so the behaviour here is a direct reflection of the corresponding @xmath99 shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath133 the @xmath124 approximation is very good , while the leading - pole approximation overestimates the evolution at all @xmath1 values shown . for less singular small-@xmath1 behaviour ( @xmath128 ) , however , both approximations reproduce the full evolution , the leading - pole approximation showing slightly better convergence for @xmath134 .    in practice ,",
    "the normalisations of the singlet quark and gluon distribution , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , will not be the same .",

    "more drastic effects of a change in the relative normalisation can be expected for the quark singlet distribution , as contributions from quark - to - quark and gluon - to - quark splitting have the same magnitude but opposite signs ( cf .  fig .",

    "this simply reflects an increased impact of the gluon - to - gluon splitting .",
    "in this letter we have studied the feasibility of two different analytic approaches to the evolution of polarised parton densities at small @xmath1 , finding that none of these approaches is able to give reliable predictions for the whole theoretically allowed range of boundary conditions in the small-@xmath1 region . in the leading - pole expansion @xcite , the full splitting functions @xmath138 are replaced by the leading terms of their laurent series around @xmath33 . as this approach correctly reproduces all terms proprotional to @xmath139 generated in the evolution ,",

    ", this approach still converges towards the full solution , but its predictions are far away from the full solution for any realistic experimental value of @xmath1 .",
    "we have also shown that the evolution of the polarised gluon distribution is sensitive to the shape of this distribution in the large-@xmath1 region .",
    "this observation raises doubts on the possibility of determining the gluon polarisation from the evolution of @xmath4 in the small-@xmath1 region .",
    "it furthermore demonstrates the need for complementary measurements of @xmath87 ( e.g. from @xmath141-production or direct-@xmath142 measurements ) .",
    "we have seen that the effects of the evolution on the quark distributions in the small-@xmath1 region are rather small , as the quark - to - quark and the gluon - to - quark splitting contribute with opposite signs .",
    "the gluon distribution is indeed rising with increasing @xmath0 , but only contributes to @xmath4 at order @xmath143 .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath144 contributes with a negative coefficient function to @xmath4 , one expects that @xmath4 will become negative at small @xmath1 for asymptotic values of @xmath0 , due to the gluonic contribution and the negative sea polarisation generated from @xmath145 splitting .    in general , the effects of the evolution on the polarised parton densities will be more moderate than the effects on the unpolarised densities .",
    "the assumption of approximate scaling for @xmath146 in the small-@xmath1 region is therefore rather doubtful .",
