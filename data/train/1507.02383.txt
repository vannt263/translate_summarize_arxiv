    "ever since the publication of the luria - delbrck model on bacterial resistance due to pre - existing mutants @xcite computational approaches to the dynamics of biological cells have contributed significantly to the advance of quantitative intracellular and cell population dynamics .",
    "apart from the luria - delbrck model and its modifications @xcite , the facilitated diffusion model has become a key to the understanding of genetic regulation in prokaryotes .",
    "following the observation of riggs and co - workers @xcite that _ in vitro _",
    "lac repressors  one specific regulatory dna binding protein commonly called transcription factors ( tfs)find their specific target sequence ( operator ) on e. coli dna at a surprisingly high rate , scientists have examined the properties of the search of tfs for their target sequence .",
    "early studies of richter and eigen @xcite were extended in the seminal work by berg , winter and von  hippel @xcite .",
    "their facilitated diffusion model explained the high association rates of tfs as a result of repeated rounds of diffusion in the bulk solution and intermittent sliding along the dna .",

    "the active role of spatial dna conformations was unveiled both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . finally , the fact that genes , that interact via local tfs , are statistically proximate along the prokaryotic genome ( colocalisation ) was argued to be due to the increased interaction rates ( rapid search hypothesis ) @xcite . in line with the increasing knowledge of the microscopic details of gene regulation many computational studies appeared that go beyond the typical idealisations @xcite .    motivated by recent experiments showing that on encounter the target operator is not detected with certainty by a tf sliding along the dna @xcite , we here combine theoretical and simulations analyses to quantify the sliding motion of a tf along the real nucleotide sequence of a common e.  coli strain in the presence of crowding proteins on the dna",

    "apart from simulations data consistent with the theoretical lines a second branch of results appears with target detection times nearly two orders of magnitude longer than expected .",
    "this effect can be rationalised by the presence of the auxiliary operator @xmath6 in the target region .",

    "however , at @xmath6 this is particularly severe since it has a rather strong binding energy ( see fig .",

    "[ fig:1 ] : in these cases even the probability to detect @xmath3 is rather small .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced for the considerably weaker @xmath6 .",
    "however , when such tfs change to the recognition state at the auxiliary operator , they will spend more time there than particles with a larger @xmath22 , since these face a larger barrier to be crossed ( eq .  ) .",
    "as not all target regions of size @xmath60 contain the auxiliary operator , the lower branch of results still coexists . here",
    "the conditional target detection time increases with @xmath26 but levels off to a plateau .",
    "conversely , for rather volatile searchers ( red data points ) in regions comprising both operators , for @xmath61 $ ] there is a slight tendency that the mean search time decreases with @xmath26 .",
    "this results from the fact that these regions , which are only marginally longer than the distance between the two operators , by definition have both operators near the boundaries .",
    "this yields longer search times , similar to the case of shorter target regions , for which the dashed lines are always above the corresponding full lines in eq .",

    "we consider the influence of the location of the operators with respect to the non - specific blockers in more detail in the following paragraph .      in the hypothetical situation of two equally strong operators in the target region ,",

    "the @xmath63 values range between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , positive values corresponding to a favourable position of @xmath3 .",
    "as expected , since @xmath3 is the stronger operator , most of the data points are positive .",
    "for small @xmath22 values ( cyan and green in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) it is more probable to detect @xmath3 first , but the relative positions of the two operators are not significant . increasing the volatility from @xmath32 to @xmath70 leads to a monotonic increase in the accuracy of discrimination between the two operators . for even larger values of @xmath22",
    "this accuracy decreases , since now the particle checks for the target often enough to detect the auxiliary operator with sufficient probability .",
    "then , geometric effects become more important , as seen from the increasing slope of the black dotted line for @xmath35 and the red dot - dashed line for @xmath71 . in the latter case ,",
    "some negative values of the preference are observed , indicating that a volatile tf is more likely to detect the auxiliary operator first , if its position is much closer to the centre of the target region .",

    "to the loop initiation time we add a time lag , since after landing with its second half in the target region , the tf has to actually detect the main operator .",
    "the latter is obtained from a simulation as defined in _",
    "simulation scheme_. the same process is possible the other way round : starting from binding to the main operator and , before switching to the search mode , closing a loop with one of the auxiliary operators . to simplify matters",

    "of particular biological interest are the time spans @xmath89 during which the operator is unoccupied , as in these intervals rna polymerase can bind to the promoter and start transcription .",
    "we start with a conformation in which looping is precluded by blocking both auxiliary operators with non - specific binders . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the distribution of @xmath89 is shown for four values of the volatility parameter @xmath22 .    in all cases",
    "we obtain two distinct peaks separating a short and a long time scale . for increasing values of @xmath22",
    "the first peak , located at around @xmath90 time units , grows relative to the second one , located at around @xmath91 time units .",
    "since the total simulation time was fixed , the total number of events grows as well : the peak at short times is due to events when a tf , after switching from the recognition to the search mode , performs just a few sliding steps before returning to the recognition state at the target .",
    "conversely , the long time peak corresponds to events when a tf dissociates , possibly multiple times , from dna and loses correlation with the unbinding position , and thus leads to long time spans , in which the target operator is vacant . that the first peak gains in importance for larger values of @xmath22 is due to the fact that , as seen above , the individual target detection probability is higher in that case .",
    "we note that to initiate transcription , rna polymerase must bind the promoter while the tf is not at the operator . if the repressor rebinds to the operator before an rna polymerase manages to find the promoter , the cell does not `` feel '' these quick occupancy fluctuations and experiences only a single effective binding event of the repressor , and no transcription takes place ( compare ref .",

    "given that the loop initiation time in this case is @xmath98 , these events can be self - consistently interpreted as return events to the target due to looping : the dna was looped between the main and an auxiliary operator , dissociates from the main operator and reestablishes the loop .     in systems where looping is possible involving @xmath5 ( black lines ) and both @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( red lines ) .",

[ fig:5],width=453 ]    that the peak for fast rebinding events has a reduced size is due to the fact that our looping algorithm counts all fast fluctuations of the occupancy during which the loop still exists as a single long - lived event . in the simulations without looping",
    "these events appeared explicitly ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the remaining events in the reduced first peak correspond to target rebinding without an existing loop to an auxiliary operator . given that fast rebinding has no biological meaning , looping introduces a new intermediate time scale , and typical return times to the operator are greatly reduced , resulting in improved repression .",
    "this agrees with the observations of choi and co - workers according to which dna looping enables the cell to regulate gene expression on many time scales via distinct forms of dissociation events @xcite . comparing this behaviour to the black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , when both 3d excursions and looping take around ten times longer , shows that both the looping peak and the rightmost peak are shifted to larger times underlining the physicality of our interpretation .",

    "three peaks are observed , and increase of @xmath72 and @xmath87 shifts the peaks  apart from the @xmath72-independent fast rebinding peak  to the right .",
    "there is one major difference between the two settings : when both auxiliary operators are accessible , the size of the third peak is nearly as large as the second one . thus , very long return times occur more often when both auxiliary operators are present .",
    "the significant changes of the target search times in the presence of the auxiliary operators are our other central result .",
    "one - dimensional sliding of a tf along the dna is a vital ingredient of the facilitated diffusion model . sliding is indispensable in the final step of the search for the specific binding site by the tf , namely , the recognition of the binding sequence . for a real bacterial dna sequence",
    "we here analyse in detail the dynamics of the tf sliding in a region around the main operator in the presence of roadblocks , e.g. , proteins like h - ns or hu @xcite . for a minimal set of parameters we unveil the role of the density of the roadblocks and the dna sequence on the detection speed of the target sequence .",
    "our results underline the special role played by auxiliary tf operators .",
    "these auxiliary operators act as a funnel for the tf to facilitate the target search in the nucleotide sequence .    more specifically , combining a simplified theoretical model and simulations we follow a tf moving in a region around the main operator delimited by two non - specifically bound roadblocks while switching between a search mode , in which it shuttles along the dna while being blind to the target , and a recognition mode , in which it can not move along dna but which is essential to detect the target .",
    "the interconversion rates depend on the underlying sequence .",
    "motivated by recent experiments showing that not every target encounter leads to detection of the target sequence @xcite , we interpolated between the extreme cases of nearly blind switching between the modes and an induced fit situation , in which the energetic barrier to be crossed changes as much as the specific binding energy .",
    "numerical results for the probability to detect the target before dissociation and for the mean detection time demonstrate impressive agreement with our theoretical model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and upper branch in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , as long as no further binding sites of similar strength are present .",
    "if an auxiliary operator is within the target region , an intermediate rate of checking for the target yielded the highest accuracy in discrimination between main and auxiliary operators .",
    "however , while auxiliary binding sites act as traps in the simplified model , in the more realistic situation when dna looping is allowed , they can be seeding points for the formation of loops joining two operators . in the second part we therefore included looping in the simulation . for our parameters , this leads to quick rebinding events to the main operator and thus increases significantly the local effective tf density , in accordance with classical observations .",
    "this approach can be easily transferred to other tfs with known binding motif .",
    "given the fairly large number of the parameters involved and the complexity of the dynamics conveyed by the broad range of apparent time scales , definite quantitative statements of this problem are hard to give .",
    "furthermore , the target search here was modelled for a single tf , while in a living bacteria cell approximately a dozen lac repressors perform this task simultaneously .",
    "additionally , other tfs could partially block the specific binding site of the tf under consideration , and could impede the establishment of the lac specific loop . as recent studies showed ( for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the effects of additional binders are not always obvious and require careful analysis",
    ". since the binding to the operator(s ) is rather strong , it is questionable to assume that the tfs are independent and we face a multi - body problem .",
    "however , the concentration effects and the expression output in terms of the occupancy of all three operators were successfully studied in terms of thermodynamic models @xcite using similar language .",
    "as our simplified theoretical model for events in the target region yields such a good agreement with the numerical simulations and given that more and more quantitative experimental results appear , it seems to be a logical extension to equip thermodynamic models with rates obtained from our model presented herein .",
    "moreover , the accessibility of the three operators could be modulated in time to mimic the mobility of nonspecific binders which can block the operators . in this spirit",
    "we believe that the results reported herein represent an important step forward toward the quantitative understanding of gene regulation in living prokaryotic cells , and form the basis for future , more detailed models .",
    "here we describe the simulations method and the calculations for the above results .",
    "the tf is present in either the loosely bound search state or tightly bound recognition state . in the search state at position",
    "@xmath15 the tf can either slide to the neighbouring sites @xmath103 or @xmath104 while remaining in the search state , it can dissociate or switch to the recognition state at the same position ( fig .  [ s_scheme ] ) .",
    "such a switching event at the target site ( the operator @xmath3 ) corresponds to detecting the target .",
    "this differs from the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a further target detection step was used after changing to the recognition state at the target site . if the particle is next to a blocker and tries to move onto the excluded site , the move is cancelled .",
    "the standard gillespie algorithm is used to draw the rates for the above events .",
    "a central role is played by the energetic barriers which need to be crossed , measured in units of @xmath27 with respect to the unbound state of zero reference energy ( similar to refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the recognition state",
    "we assume the tf to be immobile . in the first version of the model without looping the tf can only return to the search state .",
    "generally when going from state @xmath105 with energy @xmath106 to state @xmath107 with energy @xmath108 , separated by an energetic barrier @xmath109 , the rate , @xmath110 for this step is given by @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "in absence of a barrier ( @xmath113 ) and when the energy of the final state is smaller than that of the initial state ( @xmath114 ) the reaction is assumed to occur with attempt rate @xmath10 , which is the inverse of the elementary time step in which all times are measured . to convert our results to real times , this time step can be related to the known 1d diffusion coefficient of a given tf .",
    "we note that our approach differs from the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the specific binding barrier has to be crossed each time the tf slides to a neighbouring position .",
    "we fix the energy difference between the specific binding energy at the main operator @xmath3 and the energy in the search state as @xmath115 @xcite . with the choice @xmath30 applied in the main text this implies @xmath116 ( fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath117 can be determined once all values of the score matrix are known via the above mentioned demand @xmath118 @xcite .    [ [ sec : scorematrix ] ] score matrix + + + + + + + + + + + +    the score matrix is obtained from standard methods and calculated for both orientations in which the tf can bind : the pwm score @xmath119 of a putative in the most general form is written as @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath9 denotes the length of the binding motif , @xmath121 the nucleotide at position @xmath122 in the input sequence , @xmath123 the background frequency of base @xmath107 , @xmath124 the number of known binding sites , and @xmath125 a pseudo - count function .    in the following we stick to the convention used by vilar @xcite , namely , @xmath126 ( where @xmath94 is euler s number ) , @xmath127 for all @xmath121 ( all nucleotides appear with equal probability ) and @xmath128 for all @xmath107 ( we use the same pseudo - count function for all four types of nucleotides ) .",
    "given that there are @xmath129 known operators to which the repressor binds ( commonly denoted by o1 , o2 and o3 ) , this yields @xmath130 for the three known operator sites the scores are @xcite : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "a histogram of the energy values in the recognition state for the 10,001 binding positions surrounding the @xmath3 operator is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , where @xmath28 and @xmath21 ( a proportionality constant translating score differences into energetic differences ) were chosen such that @xmath134 . at the lower end of the energy spectrum the three operators can be recognised .",
    "note that there is an energetic gap to all other binding sites , see the discussion of such a gapped situation in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the simplified theoretical model includes @xmath26 possible binding positions , @xmath26 being an odd number .",
    "this way a central node exists , but an analogous calculation can be done for even @xmath26 . applying the scheme of possible reactions we have the following differential equations for the probability density @xmath135 of tfs in the search state at base pair @xmath122 at time @xmath136 and the corresponding probability density @xmath137 of tfs in the recognition state , when the tf is at bp @xmath42 , @xmath138\\notag\\\\ \\nonumber & & -k_\\mathrm{off}c_{n , j}-[k_\\mathrm{sr}+\\delta_{j , m}(k_\\mathrm{st}-k_\\mathrm{sr } ) ] c_{n , j}\\\\ & & + k_\\mathrm{rs}(1-\\delta_{j , m})p_{n , j } , \\label{si_4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath139 c _ { n , j}\\\\ & & -k_\\mathrm{rs}(1-\\delta_{j , m})p_{n , j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this set of equations is more conveniently treated in laplace space with respect to time , where we denote the variable conjugate to @xmath136 by @xmath140 and the corresponding functions with a tilde . for convenience",
