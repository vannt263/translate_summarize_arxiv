    "close to the magnetic axis in tokamaks , where the radial gradients of plasma parameters are too weak to destabilize microinstabilities @xcite , the transport of highly charged impurities is dominated by neoclassical processes @xcite . for typical density and temperature profiles",
    "this leads to an accumulation of impurities in the deep core .",
    "the accumulation not only reduces the fusion performance by diluting the plasma , but can lead to radiative cooling and trigger magnetohydrodynamic activity @xcite .",
    "tungsten excursions and radiative events are observed in recent experiments operating with tungsten plasma facing components @xcite .",
    "the possibility of accumulation of highly charged impurities in the core of reactor relevant tokamak plasmas , such as in iter , is a serious issue @xcite .",
    "therefore significant effort has been dedicated to find scenarios or active methods to reduce core impurity accumulation .",
    "auxiliary radio frequency ( rf ) heating in the ion- and electron cyclotron frequency ranges has been demonstrated as a possibility of reducing impurity accumulation @xcite .",
    "however the physical processes responsible for changing impurity transport are not fully understood . in the region very close to the axis where turbulence is not the dominant transport channel , changes in neoclassical transport or magnetohydrodynamic activity may be candidates @xcite .",
    "a bit further out from the center , changes in the turbulence properties can also play an important role .",
    "recent studies pointed towards a possible role of poloidal asymmetries which can be generated in rf heated plasmas @xcite . in plasmas lacking strong toroidal rotation the densities of the different species",
    "are usually assumed to be approximately flux functions .",
    "however a temperature anisotropy of the heated species can lead to a poloidal variation of the density of that species , which generates a poloidally varying electrostatic field @xcite .",
    "this field may be weak to leave the dynamics of the main species practically unaffected , but the response of a highly charged impurity species to these fields can be significant",
    ". the distribution of impurities on the flux surface can develop significant poloidal asymmetries , and their @xmath1 drift in the poloidally varying electrostatic field can compete with the magnetic drifts @xcite , which has important consequences on the turbulent impurity transport .",
    "the local value of the steady state radial logarithmic impurity density gradient ( referred to as the _ impurity peaking factor _ ) , is determined by the local turbulent transport . on the one hand , impurity transport in the plasma edge",
    "provides a boundary condition for the impurity density profile , thus affecting impurity accumulation in the core . on the other hand",
    ", a relatively high impurity concentration may be necessary in the edge for reactor relevant devices to reduce localized heat loads on plasma facing components through radiation .",
    "it is therefore of interest to know the impurity transport in the edge .",
    "it would be an unreasonably large undertaking to give a complete description of the edge impurity transport in one paper given the complex nature of the problem .",
    "instead , we will consider certain aspects of the problem related to poloidal asymmetries .",
    "there are experimental observations of strong poloidal in - out asymmetries in the impurity density in the edge plasma @xcite , especially in the strong gradient regions of edge transport barriers ( henceforth , we refer to the inboard / outboard impurity accumulation as in - out / out - in density asymmetry ) . in the same time",
    ", neoclassical theory also predicts poloidal impurity density asymmetries@xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that the poloidal asymmetries experimentally observed in the pedestal can be several times larger @xcite than what the theory described in refs .  @xcite predicts . this may partly be due to the simplified magnetic geometries considered , but more likely the reason is that kinetic effects associated with finite ion orbit width @xcite in the pedestal are not accounted for .    in the present paper",
    "we first give an overview of research done on turbulent impurity transport in the presence of poloidal asymmetries generated by ion cyclotron resonance heating ( icrh ) .",
    "then we consider the effect of edge asymmetries due to neoclassical effects .",
    "we use a global numerical tool for neoclassical calculations in the pedestal perfect ( pedestal & edge radially global fokker - planck evaluation of collisional transport ) @xcite , and a combination of gyrokinetic simulations and semi - analytical modeling to study the turbulent transport in the presence of poloidal asymmetries and strong radial electric fields .",

    "in numerical icrh simulations the non - maxwellian part of the distribution function of the heated ion species ( denoted by subscript @xmath2 , as minority ) is often found to exhibit velocity space structures that can be well approximated by the ansatz @xcite @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are radially varying parameters representing the perpendicular and parallel temperatures , respectively ( note that the temperature anisotropy @xmath8 due to the icrh heating ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field strength @xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 where the icrh absorption is the largest on the flux surface .",
    "the density moment of this distribution function yields a poloidally varying minority density with a maximum close to the poloidal angle @xmath11 where @xmath12 , which reflects that the heated particles tend to get trapped due to the heating with their banana tips close to the icrh resonance location .",
    "in particular , when the @xmath13 surface is tangential to the studied flux surface from the low magnetic field side ( this is the situation considered unless stated otherwise ) , the density of the heated minority species has a maximum at the outboard mid - plane ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the corresponding poloidally varying electrostatic potential @xmath15 , that sets up to sustain quasineutrality , has a minimum on the inboard side .",
    "consequently the impurities accumulate in that region .    in a large aspect ratio circular cross section plasma",
    "the poloidal variation of the impurity density is approximately sinusoidal @xmath16 \\approx n_{z0}(r)\\exp[k \\cos(\\theta-\\bar{\\theta})],$ ] where @xmath17 ( sometimes referred to as the pseudo density ) is a flux function , @xmath18 is the impurity charge number , and @xmath19 denotes the temperature of species @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore @xmath21 corresponds to the poloidal location of the maximum of the impurity density .",
    "the asymmetry strength @xmath22 can be approximated as @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24/[b_c+\\alpha_t(1-b_c)]$ ] @xcite .",

    "we assume @xmath30 and that the poloidal variations of the main ion and electron densities  @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively  are negligible",
    ".    in the edge , where the plasma parameter profiles may be sharp due to transport barriers there can be various effects which give rise to poloidal asymmetries in the impurity density . in the parallel impurity momentum equation normally the electric field and the pressure gradient terms balance , @xmath33 , leading to a boltzmann response of the impurities ( assuming @xmath30 to be a flux function ) .",
    "this means that even if the impurities are not too collisional , there is a possibility to develop poloidal impurity density asymmetries , since parallel electric fields can be present due to poloidal asymmetries in the main ion density .",
    "these asymmetries naturally arise when the main ions are in the plateau or pfirsch - schlter regime of collisionality even in the presence of weaker gradients .",
    "the form of this density variation is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "when the gradients and the collisionality are sufficiently high , so that the impurity - ion friction becomes comparable to the parallel pressure gradient term in the parallel momentum balance equation , that can also lead to poloidal impurity density variations . in this case , if the main ions are either in the banana or in the pfirsch - schlter regimes , the impurities are pushed to the inboard side @xcite , whereas in the plateau regime , there can be in - out or out - in impurity density asymmetry depending on the ratio of the density and temperature scale lengths , the strength of the impurity ion friction , and the impurity concentration @xcite .",
    "finite mach number effects can also modify the poloidal density variation and the neoclassical transport of impurities @xcite .",
    "neoclassical calculations and simulation codes normally assume that the orbit width of particles ( which , in general , is comparable to their poloidal larmor radius @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the poloidal magnetic field ) is much smaller than the radial scale length of plasma parameters . in this case",
    "a local analysis ( i.e. considering a single flux surface ) is sufficient . in very sharp pedestals",
    "this assumption may break down , first for the main ions ( and low charge number impurities ) .",
    "if the ion temperature scale length @xmath37^{-1}$ ] becomes comparable with @xmath38 , then the distribution function may not remain close to a maxwellian anymore , which requires a global , nonlinear description .",
    "however , if only the electron density and temperature scale lengths ( @xmath39^{-1}$ ] and @xmath40^{-1}$ ] ) are comparable to @xmath38 , although a global description is still necessary , the distribution function can be expanded about a maxwellian , and the linear drift - kinetic equation may be employed @xcite .",
    "this limit , apart from being convenient for theoretical studies , has physical relevance as well ; the ion temperature scale length often appears to be much larger than the density scale length in pedestals of diii - d @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in very large aspect ratio @xmath41 , the scale separation between the ion orbit width @xmath42 and @xmath38 allows for simplifications making an analytical treatment possible @xcite . in pedestals with realistic aspect ratio further poloidal asymmetries in the main ion flow",

    "on the other hand , magnetic drifts are very important , especially the radial part of the drift which is proportional to the magnetic shear that is high at the edge .",
    "the @xmath200 term is always positive , and it exhibits a weak dependence on @xmath194 due to the weak broadening of the eigenfunction with this parameter . the magnitude of the contribution of @xmath201 to the impurity peaking is comparable to that of the magnetic drifts , as expected since @xmath205 . in the in - out asymmetric case of @xmath174",
    "the @xmath201 term acts to cancel the effect of the magnetic drifts , reducing the impurity peaking factor to almost zero . in",
    "the out - in asymmetric case of @xmath180 the @xmath201 term adds to the effect of the magnetic drifts leading to a substantial positive peaking factor at higher values of @xmath194 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the contribution from the magnetic drift is higher at @xmath174 than at @xmath180 .",
    "the reason is that the radial part of the magnetic drift is @xmath206 , thus it is weighted towards the inboard side . in the expression for the peaking factor",
    "this function is multiplied by the poloidally varying impurity density which , in this case , also peaks at the inboard side .",
    "this shows that the poloidal variation of @xmath207 in combination with the magnetic drifts do not necessarily lead to a reduction of the peaking factor , especially for high magnetic shear .",
    "this observation is consistent with the trend seen in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .    for lower wave numbers @xmath208 , where usually the nonlinear flux spectra peaks",
    ", the variation of the drift terms with @xmath209 is very weak .",
    "however , both the @xmath210 and the @xmath211 terms of ( [ peak1 ] ) are inversely proportional to @xmath209 , thus they can be non - negligible for long wavelengths . at @xmath174 ( fig .",
    "[ alnzfig]a ) @xmath212 , and the contribution from the @xmath118 term is negligibly small , the positive contribution from @xmath203 around @xmath213 comes from the @xmath119 term and is a result of the small but finite up - down asymmetry . at @xmath180 ( fig .",
    "[ alnzfig]b ) @xmath214 , and although the @xmath118 term is non - negligible anymore it is still the @xmath119 term that dominates the contribution from @xmath203 . when @xmath215\\ll{\\rm re}[\\phi(\\theta)/\\phi(0)]$ ] , the @xmath119 term is approximately proportional to @xmath216 that becomes large around @xmath217 ( see fig .",
    "[ gyrores]b ) .",
    "this trend , combined with the @xmath218 dependence of the @xmath119 term , makes this term much bigger than all the other terms for small @xmath194 .",
    "accordingly , results below @xmath219 are not shown in fig .",
    "[ alnzfig]b , as the perturbative treatment of the @xmath119 term breaks down .    as a comparison",
    ", we also show the impurity peaking factors for the same plasma parameters , but without the effects of the radial and poloidal electric fields ; see the corresponding dotted curves ( total w / o @xmath15 ) in figs .",
    "[ alnzfig]a - b .",
    "in general , this curve is close to , but do not exactly coincide with the magnetic drift contribution ( dashed curves ) .",
    "most of the difference is not due to the parallel compressibility term , but rather the fact that in the presence of @xmath15 , such as for the @xmath200 curve , the weighting factor @xmath207 has a poloidal variation .",
    "notice , that the peaking factor without poloidal asymmetries is smaller than the magnetic drift term with poloidal asymmetries when the impurity density is peaked on the inboard side , and _",
    "vice versa _",
    ", again , in accordance with the poloidal variation of @xmath207 and the @xmath220 geometric factor .",
    "the general observation is that the peaking factor can be significantly modified when effects of the background electric field are taken into account ; as seen comparing the solid and the dotted lines of figs .",
    "[ alnzfig]a - b .",
    "we have derived an expression for the impurity density peaking factor with corrections relevant in a steep density pedestal with subsonic ion flows . based on realistic edge density and temperature profiles of a pedestal and a shaped magnetic geometry",
    "we calculate the electric field corresponding to the neoclassical poloidal variation of the main ion density .",
    "we use a global neoclassical solver called perfect that accounts for finite orbit width effects .",
    "these effects arise in a pedestal due to the sharp profile variations and strong radial electric fields .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of the poloidal and radial electric fields on the impurity peaking due to turbulence .",
    "we find that the poloidal location of the maximum impurity density can vary on a short radial scale in the vicinity of the pedestal . in the innermost radius of the simulation domain",
    ", there is an up - down asymmetry that transits to an in - out asymmetry , which flips to an out - in asymmetry in the strong density gradient region , then back to an in - out asymmetry again , just inside the last closed flux surface .",
    "the exact variation of the poloidal potential found here is not expected to be a universal feature , it depends on the plasma parameter profiles .",
    "however , non - negligible poloidal electric fields and their rapid variation radially may be expected in sufficiently sharp pedestals .",
    "we find that neoclassical asymmetries in the edge can be strong enough to significantly modify the turbulent impurity peaking , even though the profiles used here for the neoclassical calculation are not specifically chosen to maximize this effect . due to the high safety factor and magnetic shear close to the lcfs , the effect of parallel compressibility is negligibly small compared to that of the magnetic- , and the radial @xmath57 drifts .",
    "the latter can reduce or enhance the peaking factor depending on whether the poloidally varying potential is such that the impurity density peaks in the inboard or the outboard side .",
    "due to the high magnetic shear close to the lcfs the radial part of magnetic drifts is more important than the poloidal part .",
    "when the contribution of the @xmath57 drift to the poloidal motion of the ions is non - negligible compared to that of the parallel streaming ( @xmath185 ) , as in the pedestal studied here , additional terms become important in the expression for the impurity peaking factor ( [ peak1 ] ) .",
    "one of them is @xmath211 and it is finite when there is some up - down variation of the long wavelength potential @xmath15 . the other one is formally similar to the parallel compressibility term , but larger by a factor @xmath221 . in our case study , even though the up - down component of the asymmetry is small at the studied radii , the @xmath211 term has a significant contribution to the impurity peaking factor , especially at small values of @xmath194 .",
    "we note that we neglected impurity - ion friction effects in the neoclassical calculation which may also modify the poloidal variation of the impurity density .",
    "while a sharp density pedestal can be handled by the neoclassical simulation code used here , the code relies on the assumption of a slow ion temperature variation .",
    "this simplifying assumption could only be relaxed in a nonlinear , full-@xmath222 kinetic code .",
