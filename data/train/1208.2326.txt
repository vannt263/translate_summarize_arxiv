    "adiabatic passage techniques are an efficient approach to design a control pulse which drives a quantum system from an initial state to a specific target state ( for recent overviews , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such processes have found a large variety of applications ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and quantum information to atomic and molecular excitations @xcite .",
    "adiabatic methods are usually achieved by using a series of intense pulses which can be frequency chirped , the frequencies and the chirped being chosen with respect to the structure of the energy levels of the quantum system .",
    "the modification of the shape of the pulse envelope and the chirping rate must be sufficiently slow so as to fulfill adiabatic conditions . in this paper",
    ", we will consider one of the most well - known adiabatic processes , the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) excitation @xcite , which involves a counterintuitive sequence of two pulses in a three - level quantum system .",
    "this approach , which allows a complete population transfer between two energy levels , is also robust in the sense that it is not sensitive to small variations of the field parameters .",
    "the adiabatic methods have however some major drawbacks , which can be roughly summarized in a high pulse energy and a long control duration .",
    "such constraints can be problematic , e.g. , if other concurrent physical or chemical processes with the same time scale occur during the control .",
    "this statement can be expressed by saying that adiabatic fields are not able to reach the physical limits of the best possible performance of the system in terms of duration or energy of the pulse .",
    "these limits can be established by using optimal control theory @xcite , which has been introduced in the eighties in the quantum control community .",
    "an optimal control problem can be solved either from geometric and analytic tools @xcite for systems of low dimensions or from numerical algorithms in the case of large dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the two approaches are based on the application of the pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) @xcite , which transforms the control problem into an hamiltonian one . in this framework ,",
    "the computation of the optimal solution is replaced by the determination of an hamiltonian trajectory satisfying given boundary conditions .",
    "a general problem with optimal solutions is their lack of robustness against variations of the system parameters and of the control field .",
    "note that a method based on the simultaneous control of different systems can be used to improve this latter property ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but this purely numerical approach does not give any insight into the robustness nature of the optimal solutions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the relationship between adiabatic and optimal pulses in the case of a three - level quantum system where the stirap solution can be used .",
    "this question has been analyzed in different works over the past few years but not directly from a geometric optimal control perspective .",
    "this work complements therefore several earlier numerical @xcite and analytical studies @xcite on this relation . to summarize some previous results , we mention that the authors of @xcite argue that the stirap technique can not be expressed as an optimal control solution .",
    "the counterintuitive sequence of stirap was recovered numerically in @xcite by considering as cost functional the population of the intermediate level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a tracking technique aiming at minimizing the population into the intermediate state was proposed to recover the adiabatic solution , but no insight into the relation between the adiabatic pulse and the optimal one was given . in @xcite ,",
    "the hamilton - jacobi bellman theorem was used to solve the optimal control problem .    in this work ,",
    "we first consider the energy minimization control problem .",
    "using the hamiltonian structure derived from the pmp , we show that the stirap solution can be associated to a peculiar singularity of this system .",
    "however , in this case , the adiabatic pulse can be viewed as a singular limit solution of the hamiltonian system which can not be approached smoothly by an optimal control field . in a second step ,",
    "we show that the stirap pulse is solution of an optimal control problem corresponding to a specific cost functional , that we call _ stirap cost_. using this geometric analysis , we extend this approach to the case of a four - level quantum system @xcite .",

    "the system is described by a pure state @xmath1 belonging to a three - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 spanned by the basis @xmath3 .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it is then straightforward to see that only the coordinates @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are coupled to each other .",

    "this corresponds to the passage for @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "this transfer can be realized by a standard stirap strategy in which the pulses are applied in a counterintuitive order , i.e. the stokes pulse precedes the pump pulse .",
    "we propose to revisit in the next section this control problem by using the pmp .",
    "we first analyze the optimal control of this three - level system with the constraint of minimizing the energy of the laser fields .",

    "this optimal control problem with no dissipation , i.e. @xmath39 , has been already solved in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the optimal solution is associated to an intuitive order of the stokes and pump pulses . here",
    ", we consider the same analysis by adding a dissipative term on the intermediate state which forces the control to not populate this level , mimicking thus the adiabatic trajectory .",
    "since there is no constraint on the control fields , these latter can be computed explicitly from the maximization condition which leads to : @xmath40 in the regular case where @xmath36 can be normalized to @xmath41 , one deduces that the optimal controls are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . plugging the expressions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 into the first equation of ( [ eq7 ] )",
    ", it is straightforward to check that the hamiltonian @xmath44 reads : @xmath45 the corresponding hamiltonian dynamics encodes all the information about the optimal trajectories of the control problem .",
    "a global overview of these solutions can be obtained through a geometric analysis of this dynamics , which is made clearer by the introduction of the following spherical coordinates : @xmath46 the dynamical system takes then the form : @xmath47 it can be simplified by using the controls @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that : @xmath50 note that the cost @xmath33 is not modified since @xmath51 .",

    "this remark is an illustration of the well - known fact that the exactly adiabatic trajectory is singular and needs an infinite transfer time",

    "the topology of the singular torus can be of different types : a point ( for an equilibrium ) , a circle ( for a periodic orbit ) or a more complicated two - dimensional structure .",

    "<S> this work explores the relationship between optimal control theory and adiabatic passage techniques in quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the study is based on a geometric analysis of the hamiltonian dynamics constructed from the pontryagin maximum principle . in a three - level quantum system </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the stimulated raman adiabatic passage technique can be associated to a peculiar hamiltonian singularity . </S>",
    "<S> one deduces that the adiabatic pulse is solution of the optimal control problem only for a specific cost functional . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is extended to the case of a four - level quantum system . </S>"
