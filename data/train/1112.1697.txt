    "the discovery of the unusual @xmath22-ray / x - ray transient swiftj164449.3 + 573451 ( hereafter , ) , which coincided with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy at @xmath23 , has opened a new window into high - energy transient phenomena , with potential implications to our understanding of relativistic outflows in systems such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the prevailing interpretation for this event is the tidal disruption of a star by a dormant supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath24 m@xmath9 ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for alternative explanations ) .",
    "the argument for a tidal disruption origin is based on : ( i ) a positional coincidence ( @xmath25 kpc ) with the host galaxy nucleus ; ( ii ) rapid time variability in @xmath22-rays and x - rays ( @xmath26 s ) , which requires a compact source of @xmath27 au , a few times the schwarzschild radius of a @xmath28 m@xmath9 black hole ; ( iii ) high @xmath22-ray and x - ray luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath30 , which exceeds the eddington limit of a @xmath28 m@xmath9 black hole by @xmath31 orders of magnitude ; ( iv ) a lack of previous radio to @xmath22-ray activity from this source to much deeper limits than the observed outburst , pointing to a rapid onset ; and ( v ) long - term x - ray luminosity evolution following @xmath32 , as expected from the fallback of tidally disrupted material ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    equally important ,  was accompanied by bright radio synchrotron emission , with an initial peak in the millimeter band ( @xmath33 mjy ) and a steep spectral slope at lower frequencies indicative of self - absorption ( @xcite ; hereafter , zbs11 ) .",
    "the properties of the radio emission established the existence of a relativistic outflow with a lorentz factor of @xmath34 ( zbs11 , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution also demonstrated that the lack of detected optical variability required significant rest - frame extinction ( @xmath35 mag ; zbs11 , @xcite ) , and that the x - rays were produced by a distinct emission component , rather than inverse compton scattering by the radio - emitting relativistic electrons ( zbs11 ) .",
    "finally , the evolution of the radio emission on a timescale of @xmath36 d pointed to an ambient density with a radial profile of roughly @xmath37 , as well as a mild increase in the energy of the outflow ( zbs11 ) .",
    "the formation of a relativistic jet with dominant x - ray and radio emission were not predicted in standard tidal disruption models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which instead focused on the thermal optical / uv emission from the long - term accretion of the stellar debris .",
    "a signature of the latter process is a mass accretion rate that evolves as @xmath38 , presumably leading to emission with the same temporal dependence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . shortly before the discovery of",
    ", @xcite investigated the potential signature of a putative relativistic outflow , and concluded that the interaction of the outflow with the ambient medium will lead to radio emission on a timescale of @xmath39 yr ( for typical off - axis observers ) .",
    "while the mechanism for the radio emission from  is interaction with an external medium , the actual light curves differ from the off - axis prediction .",
    "to address this issue , in a follow - up paper @xcite ( hereafter , mgm11 ) reconsidered the model for a relativistic jet interacting with an ambient medium .",
    "they draw on the inferences from the early radio emission described in zbs11 to infer the properties of the environment and the jet kinetic energy , and use this information to predict the future evolution of the radio emission .",
    "this long - term radio evolution is of great interest because it can provide several critical insights :    * the integrated energy release in the relativistic outflow , including the anticipated injection from on - going accretion . * the density profile around a previously - dormant smbh on @xmath40 pc scales , which can not be otherwise probed in agn .",
    "* the potential to spatially resolve the outflow with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , and hence to measure the dynamical evolution ( expansion and potentially spreading ) of a relativistic jet .",
    "* predictions for the radio emission from tidal disruption jets as viewed by off - axis observers on timescales of months to years to decades .",
    "the energy scale and jet dynamics are of particular importance since the total energy input and the structure of the jet may also have implications for relativistic jets in grbs and agn .",
    "the ability to trace the environment on parsec scales provides a unique probe of gas inflow or outflow around an inactive smbh on scales that can not be probed outside of the milky way .",
    "finally , the long - term radio emission from  will inform future radio searches for tidal disruption events ( tdes ) that can overcome the low detection rate in @xmath22-rays / x - rays ( due to beaming ) , and obscuration due to extinction in the optical / uv ( as in the case of ) .    to extract these critical properties we are undertaking long - term monitoring of the radio emission from  using a wide range of centimeter- and millimeter - band facilities . here",
    "we present radio observations of  that extend to @xmath11 d , and use these observations to determine the evolution of the total energy and ambient density .",
    "we find that the evolution of both quantities deviates from the behavior at @xmath41 month ( presented in zbs11 ) , thereby providing crucial insight into the structure of the relativistic outflow and the ambient medium .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that will investigate the long - term radio evolution of  and the implications for relativistic jets and parsec - scale environments around supermassive black holes , including efforts to resolve the source with vlbi and to measure polarization .",
    "the current paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the radio observations in  [ sec : obs ] , and summarize the radio evolution at @xmath42 d in  [ sec : prem ] . in  [ sec : model ] we present our modeling of the radio emission , which utilizes the formulation of mgm11 .",
    "the implications for the energy scale and ambient density are discussed in  [ sec : energy ] and  [ sec : density ] , respectively , and we finally consider the implications for relativistic jets and the parsec - scale environments of smbhs in  [ sec : implic ] .",

    "the light curves at observed frequencies of 4.9 , 6.7 , 15.4 , 19 , 24 , 43 , 90 , and 230 ghz are presented in figure  [ fig : lcs ] .",
    "as described in zbs11 , the light curves at 4.9 to 24 ghz exhibit an initial rapid increase , with a flux density of @xmath68 , followed by a shallower increase , with @xmath69 . in the millimeter band ,",
    "the light curves peak on a timescale of a few days and then decline as @xmath70 .",
    "this evolution is due to a synchrotron spectrum that is optically thin in the millimeter band and optically thick in the centimeter band , with a peak frequency and flux density that decline as a function of time as @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( zbs11 ) .",
    "the properties of the spectral energy distribution , along with measurements of interstellar scintillation , established that the outflow is relativistic ( @xmath73 ) , that the density profile of the circumnuclear medium ( cnm ) is roughly @xmath74 , and that the post - shock energy increases as @xmath75 ( zbs11 ) .",
    "the most striking result from our new observations is that the millimeter flux on a timescale of @xmath76 d is significantly brighter than expected from an extrapolation of the early decline .",
    "indeed , at 90 ghz the brightness is comparable to the initial peak at @xmath77 d. a similar effect is observed at lower frequencies , where the light curves exhibit an upturn starting at @xmath78 d , with @xmath79 .",
    "the 90 ghz light curve is already in a declining ( i.e. , optically thin ) phase at @xmath80 d , while the light curves at 4.9 to 24 ghz peak at @xmath81 d ( 19 and 24 ghz ) , @xmath82 d ( 15.4 ghz ) , @xmath83 d ( 8.4 ghz ) , and @xmath84 d ( 4.9 and 6.7 ghz ) , with peak flux densities of @xmath85 mjy , @xmath86 mjy , @xmath87 mjy , and @xmath88 mjy , respectively .",
    "these observations are at odds with the light curve evolution predicted by mgm11 based on our radio data at @xmath89 d , using a model that assumes a constant energy and a steady @xmath90 cnm profile ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "the observed change in the light curve evolution at @xmath91 month requires an increase in the outflow kinetic energy and/or the cnm density .",
    "the evolution of the peak frequency , roughly @xmath92 at @xmath93 d , is slower than expected for the characteristic synchrotron frequency , @xmath94 ( see  [ sec : model ] ) . since @xmath95 only depends on the kinetic energy , @xmath96 @xcite , the observed evolution requires an increase in the energy , with @xmath97 . at the same time , the similar light curve evolution at 4.9 and 24 ghz , which straddle the self - absorption frequency ( see  [ sec : model ] ) , indicates that the density must also change . in particular , at 4.9 ghz",
    "we expect @xmath98 , while at 24 ghz we expect @xmath99 ; here @xmath100 is a fiducial density that parametrizes the cnm density , with @xmath101 . for the observed light curve evolution of @xmath79 at both frequencies , and using the inferred evolution of @xmath102 , we find that @xmath103 .",
    "thus , both the energy and density normalization appear to increase at @xmath104 d. in the next section we model the radio emission in detail to extract the temporal evolution of the energy and density .",
    "to determine the temporal evolution of the relativistic outflow and the radial density profile we use the formulation of mgm11 , which draws on the grb afterglow model of @xcite ( hereafter , gs02 ) . the mgm11 model is largely motivated by the basic properties of the outflow that were determined in our initial study of the radio emission ( zbs11 ) , as well as by the observed evolution of the x - ray emission @xcite .",

    "this is expected for fallback accretion in a tde , and is observationally motivated by the evolution of the x - ray light curve , which also indicates that @xmath111 s @xcite . as a result of the long - term injection of energy ,",
    "the expectation is that the kinetic energy will gradually increase from an initial value of @xmath112 to a final level of @xmath113 . from the initial x - ray luminosity , @xmath114 erg s@xmath30 , the expected total",
    "energy is @xmath115 erg , where @xmath116 is the efficiency of the jet in producing x - rays ( mgm11 ) , while the predicted beaming - corrected energy is @xmath117 erg .",
    "the interaction of the outflow with the cnm leads to synchrotron emission due to the acceleration of electrons and amplification of magnetic fields .",
    "based on the early radio observations , zbs11 demonstrated that the cnm density roughly follows @xmath74 ( hereafter , wind medium ) , which is the profile adopted for the analysis in mgm11 .",
    "the lorentz factor of the fluid behind the forward shock is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the circumnuclear density and @xmath120 is the density of the ejecta ( see mgm11 ) ; this relation is appropriate for the case of a newtonian reverse shock , i.e. , @xmath121 @xcite , which as we find below is appropriate for  ( table  [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "a key difference between the mgm11 model and the gs02 grb afterglow model is that the former includes a suppression of the flux density by a factor of @xmath122 due to the finite extent of the collimated outflow ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) .",
    "thus , the synchrotron emission from the relativistic outflow is determined by @xmath107 , @xmath119 , and the fractions of post - shock energy in the radiating electrons ( @xmath124 ) and the magnetic field ( @xmath125 ) .",

    "this is in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "thus , a jet with a distribution of lorentz factors of @xmath213 naturally explains the evolution of source size and the substantial increase in energy beyond the on - going input from a @xmath196 tail .",
    "in addition to the substantial increase in energy , we also find that the normalization of the density profile , @xmath214 , changes as a function of time ( figure  [ fig : params ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the radial density structure is not a simple wind profile , for which @xmath135 is by definition constant .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath135 decreases at @xmath215 d , followed by a steady increase at @xmath216 d is about a factor of 8 .",
    "the resulting radial density profile is shown in figure  [ fig : nr ] , and clearly reflects the complex evolution of @xmath135 .",
    "the density profile at @xmath217 pc is @xmath218 , followed by a uniform density at @xmath4 pc , and a slow transition back to @xmath219 by @xmath15 pc .",
    "the inferred density is @xmath220 @xmath18 at @xmath221 pc , respectively .",
    "these values scale with the choice of equipartition fractions : for @xmath185 the density is about 3 times larger , while for @xmath169 it is about 1.7 times lower .",
    "thus , the inferred density is fairly robust to large changes in the equipartition fractions .",
    "the flattening at @xmath4 pc coincides with the rapid increase in energy at @xmath222 d. this can be understood in the context of an outflow with a distribution of lorentz factors since the relative increase in density compared to the previous @xmath223 profile leads to enhanced contribution from lower lorentz factor ejecta .",
    "a similar effect has been observed in the radio emission from some core - collapse supernovae , which have a steep ejecta profile with @xmath224 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : nr ] are the inferred densities in the central parsec of the milky way galactic center from x - ray measurements @xcite .",
    "the galactic center density is similar that inferred for  at @xmath225 pc , but is about 30 times larger at @xmath226 pc .",
    "if the bulk of the gas in the central parsec is due to mass loss from massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the lower density inferred here may indicate a much smaller number of massive stars in the central parsec of the host galaxy of .",
    "although we can not investigate star formation on scales smaller than @xmath227 kpc in the host of , the overall star formation rate in this galaxy is indeed a factor of several times lower than in the milky way @xcite .",
    "regardless of the reason for the difference in density , it is quite remarkable that the radio emission from  offers as detailed a view ( or better ) of the density profile in the inner parsec around an inactive smbh at @xmath23 as available for the galactic center at a distance of only 8.5 kpc .      using the radio modeling",
    "we can also predict the optical and near - ir emission from the jet . in figure",
    "[ fig : oir ] we plot the optical @xmath156-band upper limits from @xcite , as well as their near - ir @xmath228-band measurements .",
    "the latter include the total flux from and its host galaxy since transient - free templates are not presently available .",
    "we estimate the host contribution to be about @xmath229 @xmath20jy ( @xmath230 ab mag ) by requiring that the overall shape of the @xmath228-band light curve match our predicted light curve .",
    "we note that this only affects the light curve shape at @xmath231 d since at earlier times the observed flux is dominated by the transient itself . a simple extrapolation of our model over - predicts the @xmath228-band flux density by about an order of magnitude , indicating the presence of an additional break in the spectrum between the radio and optical / near - ir band .",
    "such a break is indicative of the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath232 . to explain the @xmath228-band flux density requires @xmath233 hz .",
    "even if we include this break , the observed @xmath156-band limits are still a factor of about 70 times fainter than the model prediction .",
    "to explain this discrepancy requires host galaxy extinction of @xmath234 mag ( see also @xcite , zbs11 ) . with the addition of a cooling break and host galaxy extinction we find an excellent match between our model and the near - ir fluxes .",
    "since these data were not used in the fitting , the agreement between our model and the data provides an independent confirmation of the model .",
    "our on - going radio observations have uncovered two unexpected and critical results regarding the nature of the relativistic outflow from  and the parsec - scale environment around a previously - dormant smbh .",
    "we find that the relativistic outflow is not dominated by a single lorentz factor , as typically assumed in grb jet models .",
    "instead , the outflow has a lorentz factor distribution with @xmath235 , at least over the range of lorentz factors probed so far , @xmath236 .",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of supernova ejecta , in which the energy is a strong function of velocity , @xmath224 @xcite . in the sn case ,",
    "this coupling reflects shock acceleration through the steep density gradient in the outer envelope of the star . in the case of  we",
    "do not expect such a density gradient , suggesting instead that the ejecta structure may be an intrinsic property of relativistic jet launching , potentially through the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite . in this case , the same structure may also apply to the relativistic jets of grbs , which are generally assumed to have a single lorentz factor .    to assess this possibility we compare the ratio of event duration to the accretion disk dynamical timescale , @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the black hole schwarzschild radius . for similar ratios of @xmath239 , since @xmath240 , the dynamical timescale in  is about @xmath241 times longer than in grbs .",
    "the ratio of durations is similar , @xmath28 s for  and @xmath242 s for grbs .",
    "therefore , the ratio of duration to dynamical timescale is similar , and the jet launching mechanism may imprint a similar profile in the case of  and grbss . of course , in long grbs the jet still has to propagate through the stellar envelope , which may modify the jet structure .",
    "we next address the potential implications of the radial density profile and the flattening at @xmath4 pc .",
    "one possibility is that this scale represents the bondi radius for spherical accretion from the cnm , @xmath243 ; here @xmath244 is the sound speed in the cnm and @xmath245 is the schwarzschild radius of the smbh . for a cnm gas temperature of @xmath246 k @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath247 pc for the smbh mass of @xmath248 m@xmath9 inferred for .",
    "thus , the radius at which we infer a density enhancement is in reasonable agreement with the expected bondi radius .",
    "in addition , we note that the expected density profile inside the bondi radius , @xmath2 , matches the inferred profile for  on a scale of @xmath249 pc . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the medium outside the bondi radius is assumed to have a uniform density , while here we infer a continued decline in the density at @xmath250 pc .",
    "this may reflect the complex conditions in the inner few parsecs around the smbh in which the interstellar density profile may be mainly influenced by mass loss from stars ( as in the case of the milky way galactic center ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , from the inferred density of @xmath251 @xmath18 at @xmath252 pc , the required mass loss rate is @xmath253 m@xmath9 yr@xmath30 for a wind velocity of @xmath254 km s@xmath30 .    in particular ,",
    "in the case of the galactic center it has long been believed that the gas in the central parsec is supplied by mass loss from massive stars , with the bulk of the gas ( @xmath255 ) being thermally expelled in a wind ( @xcite , but see @xcite for an alternative interpretation of the x - ray emission ) . using a spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulation of the gas supplied by stellar winds",
    ", @xcite showed that beyond about 0.4 pc gas is mainly expelled with a resulting wind profile ( @xmath37 ) on larger scales , while on scales of @xmath256 pc the profile is roughly as expected for bondi accretion ( @xmath2 ) ; see figure  [ fig : nr ] .",
    "the profile we find here is somewhat different from this model , but this may be due to a different distribution of massive stars , or to the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry in the model .",
    "we presented radio observations of  extending to @xmath0 d and spanning a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the evolution of the radio emission changes dramatically at @xmath257 month , requiring an increase in the total energy by about an order of magnitude , a density profile of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 pc ) , and a flattening at @xmath4 pc .",
    "a comparison of the model to optical limits and near - ir detections indicates a cooling break at @xmath233 hz and host galaxy extinction of @xmath258 mag .",
    "the increase in energy can not be explained by injection from an @xmath5 tail that is expected in tidal disruption events and which matches the evolution of the x - ray emission .",
    "we conclude that a natural explanation is a structured outflow with @xmath6 . the inferred density profile and the radial scale of the density enhancement are in rough agreement with the expectation for bondi accretion from a circumnuclear medium .",
    "the jet energetics and structure , as well as the detailed density profile on @xmath259 pc scale are a testament to the important insight that can be gained from continued radio observations of . in particular ,",
    "the radial density profile is traced in greater detail than even the inner parsec of the milky way .",
    "continued radio observations will probe the environment to a scale of @xmath260 pc in the coming decade .    using the results of our analysis",
    "we can predict the future evolution of the radio emission ( modulo any future unpredictable changes in energy and/or density as we have found here ) .",
    "we use the evolution of @xmath107 and @xmath119 as inferred from the data at @xmath261 d , and assume that the density will continue to evolve as @xmath218 and that the energy will increase to a maximum beaming - corrected value of @xmath262 $ ] with @xmath263 erg .",
    "the resulting light curves at 6 and 22 ghz are shown in figure  [ fig : predlc ] .",
    "the long - term evolution is marked by a break when @xmath102 achieves its maximum value , corresponding to about @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 yr for our three choices of maximum energy . using the @xmath267 sensitivity of the evla in an observation of a few hours",
    ", we find that the emission at 22 and 6 ghz should be detectable for at least @xmath268 yr and @xmath269 yr , respectively . indeed , any significant upgrades to the evla or the construction of more sensitive radio facilities in the coming decades may extend the range of detectability to centuries .",
    "the same is true if the total energy scale is @xmath270 erg .",
    "an equally important question is whether the jet will be resolvable with vlbi in the future .",
    "the projected radius is @xmath271 , as long as the jet maintains its collimation . in figure",
    "[ fig : predrad ] we plot the predicted future evolution of @xmath156 using the prescription described above .",
    "we find that for @xmath14 and a best - case vlbi angular resolution of @xmath272 mas ( fwhm ) , the source should become resolvable at @xmath273 yr . on this timescale",
    "the 22 ghz flux density is expected to be only @xmath274 mjy ( figure  [ fig : predlc ] ) , still accessible with vlbi . while the flux density at 6 ghz is expected to be larger by about a factor of @xmath275 , the angular resolution at this frequency",
    "is poorer by about a factor of 3.7 , making it less competitive than 22 ghz .",
    "thus , we conclude that the radio emission from  may be marginally resolved in a few years . on the other hand , if the jet undergoes significant spreading on the timescale at which it becomes non - relativistic ( as expected for grb jets : e.g. , @xcite ) it is possible that it will become resolvable at @xmath276 yr when the expected 22 ghz flux density is still @xmath260 mjy .",
    "we are undertaking continued multi - frequency radio monitoring of to follow the long - term evolution of the relativistic outflow and the radial profile of the ambient medium . even in the absence of any future dramatic changes relative to the current evolution",
    ", we expect that in the next few years we may be able to determine the total energy of the relativistic outflow , measure the spreading of the jet , and study the radial density profile to a scale of @xmath260 pc .",
