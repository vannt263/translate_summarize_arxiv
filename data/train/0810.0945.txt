    "a small but significant fraction of low - luminosity radio galaxies have a pair of large low - surface - brightness lobes oriented at an angle to the high - surface - brightness ` active ' radio lobes , giving the total source an ` x ' shape .",
    "this peculiar and small subclass of extragalactic radio sources is commonly referred to as x - shaped , or ` winged ' sources .",
    "typically , both sets of lobes are symmetrically aligned through the centre of the associated elliptical host galaxy and are approximately equal in linear extent .",
    "@xcite noted that the majority of these sources are of fanaroff - riley type ii ( frii ) @xcite and the rest are either fris or have an intermediate classification .",
    "several authors have attempted to explain the unusual structure in x - shaped sources .",
    "one proposal is that these objects are produced by a central engine that has been reoriented , perhaps due to a minor merger ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", they may also result from two pairs of jets , which are associated with a pair of unresolved agns ( @xcite , 2007 ) , although this model does not as yet explain ( i ) why is there always only one pair of hotspots and ( ii ) why , when a jet is observed , is it always in the same pair of lobes ?",
    "additional models for the morphologies of the x - shaped sources include a hydrodynamic origin ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) while some authors have suggested a conical precession of the jet axis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more detailed discussion of the competing models .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,>,^,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     although the core is unclear in all our maps , the spectral index is @xmath10.08  @xmath20.01 ,",
    "@xmath10.61  @xmath20.02 at the location of the core between 1.4  ghz and 610  mhz , and 610  mhz and 240  mhz , respectively .",
    "the low frequency radio maps presented above show morphologies that are similar to the morphologies at high frequencies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . our spectral index mapping and measurement",
    "show that in general in these normal frii radio galaxies we do not find any evidence that low - surface - brightness features have flatter spectral indices than the high - surface - brightness active lobes ; this is true even of the weak ` wings ' seen in sources like 3c285 , 3c382 and 3c452 , and contrasts with the population of x - shaped sources studied by @xcite .",
    "the one exception to this trend is 3c321 , where a low - surface - brightness feature , very similar to one ` wing ' of known x - shaped sources , shows a flat spectral index between 610  mhz and 1.5  ghz as compared to the high - surface - brightness lobes . by definition ,",
    "true x - shaped sources show two symmetrical wings and the wings are of similar angular size to the ` active ' lobes ; marginal differences between two axes , _",
    "e.g. _ , in 3c192 and 3c403 , may be due to projection effects . in 3c321 ,",
    "the ` wing ' is somewhat smaller than the active lobes , but again this is possibly due to projection .",
    "the absence of a corresponding wing on the southern lobe is however harder to account for : from the 1.4 ghz data we estimate that any non - detected wing on this side must be at least 25 times fainter than the detected feature .",
    "if the ` wing ' of 3c321 s northern lobe is indeed identical to the ` wings ' seen in x - shaped radio sources , then its flat spectral index suggests that it may have something in common with the class of x - shaped sources , discussed by @xcite , in which the spectral index of the wing is flatter than that of the active lobe . in this case",
    "the @xcite model , in which the active galaxy consists of two pairs of jets that are associated with two unresolved agns , may be a possible model for 3c321 as well .",
    "consistent with this scenario , @xcite noted that the host galaxy of 3c321 and the companion galaxy are in the process of merging , and each hosts an agn that is luminous in the x - ray .",
    "however , the two agns in this system are resolved in the radio , and only one ( the one hosted by the larger galaxy ) has a radio detection , implying a current jet ; in addition , the one - sided nature of the wing in 3c321 is hard to explain in this model .",
    "other explanations are possible for the wing . @xcite",
    "have shown that the inner radio morphology of the source is atypical for an frii radio source ; a small - scale jet emerges from the nucleus of its host galaxy , produces a knot of radio emission that lies immediately to the south ( in projection ) of a smaller companion galaxy , and then flares and bends into a diffuse structure towards the north @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible that the peculiar small - scale structure is in some way related to the large - scale wing ( although evans et al",
    ".  argue that the small - scale disruption of the jet is a transient phenomenon and can not have been going on for long enough to produce the observed wing ) .",
    "although the environment of the merging host galaxy is complex and might be expected to produce disrupted lobe structures by purely hydrodynamical processes , this  as with the x - shaped sources  does not in itself explain the anomalously flat spectra found in our analysis .",
    "we have presented results from a gmrt and vla study of a sample of eight nearby frii radio galaxies that are qualitatively matched with the sample of known x - shaped radio sources in size , morphological properties and redshift .",
    "the radio measurements presented here represent most of the database that we require for rigorously testing and understanding the formation models of x - shaped radio sources .",
    "our conclusions from our new observations can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the radio morphologies of the sample sources at low radio frequencies are largely identical to the morphologies seen at high frequencies using the vla .",
    "2 .   in almost all our sample sources",
    "we find that in the hotspots and lobes there is monotonic steepening of the radio spectrum from the hotspots to the low surface brightness features , a classical spectral signature seen in almost all normal frii radio galaxies .",
    "the spectral results for frii radio sources are largely consistent with the spectral results of active lobes in x - shaped radio sources ; therefore there is something ` special ' about the wings of x - shaped sources , in the sense that they do not simply behave like the low - surface - brightness regions of more typical frii sources .",
    "4 .   for the hydrodynamic model ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to remain viable in the light of this result , the spectral flattening in the wings must be produced by some other process , such as reacceleration at internal shocks .",
    "detection of shock features in the wings might support the hydrodynamic model . the hydrodynamic model is also faced with the problem of the rotational symmetry of x - shaped radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "since the low surface brightness feature in 3c321 , a classical frii radio source , also shows unusual spectral behaviour , similar to the spectral behaviour seen in wings in some of the x - shaped sources , it seems that 3c321 may have some similarity to x - shaped sources .",
    "this similarity raises the possibility that 3c321 consists of two pairs of jets , which are associated with two agns , a possible formation model for known x - shaped sources @xcite , but this model has some difficulties ; there is no completely satisfactory explanation for the ` wing ' of 3c321 .",
