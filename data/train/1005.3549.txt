    "evolved low - mass stars show photospheric cno isotopic ratios that in many cases are not reproduced by stellar evolutionary codes . in the past years",
    "it was recognized by many authors @xcite that these chemical anomalies derive from transport mechanisms linking the envelope to zones where partial h - burning occurs .",
    "we call these phenomena `` extra - mixing '' or `` deep mixing '' throughout this report .",
    "* hereafter nbw03 ) presented a parametric study of such mixing episodes , suitable to account for the cno abundances measured in presolar grains of agb origin .",
    "the adopted formalism was based on two parameters , namely the rate of mass transport ( @xmath4 ) and the temperature ( @xmath5 ) of the deepest zones reached by the circulation .",
    "it was also demonstrated that important composition changes can occur without introducing feedbacks on the stellar luminosity , provided @xmath5 is kept low enough ( typically , @xmath6 0.08@xmath70.1 , where @xmath8 is the temperature at which the maximum energy of the h - burning shell is released ) .",
    "subsequently , physical models for extra - mixing have been explored , which avoid the difficulties previously found with rotationally - induced mechanisms @xcite .",
    "in particular , hydrodynamical models of diffusive processes induced by variations of the mean molecular weight @xmath9 @xcite , called _ thermohaline diffusion _",
    "@xcite , were presented by @xcite .",
    "they showed that @xmath3he burning into @xmath10he and two protons successfully induces the required @xmath9 inversion ( @xmath11 10@xmath12 ) , thus driving mixing episodes .",
    "complementarily , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that extra - mixing might be driven by magnetic buoyancy , in a dynamo process operating below the envelope .",
    "the model by nbw03 referred explicitly to agb stars , which are known to be the parents of most presolar grains @xcite .",
    "extra - mixing in these objects was considered as necessary by various authors @xcite .",
    "however , a recent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kcs10 ) sheds doubts on this requirement , suggesting that slow mass circulation on the rgb might be sufficient . in order to solve the above dilemma",
    ", we have to look at the observational data , asking whether there is any clear requirement for extra - mixing on the agb .",
    "our answer will be that this requirement exists and comes primarily from oxide presolar grains @xcite",
    ". then one must look for a similarly clear constraint from stars , and we find it in the carbon isotope ratios of c(n ) giants .",
    "other pieces of evidence ( from ba stars , c - enhanced metal poor stars , etc . ) , although relevant , will not be addressed here for reasons of space . in order to demonstrate all this we generalize the calculations by nbw03 , extending them to cover also rgb stages and including two more values of the initial mass . in section 2",
    "we compare our results for rgb phases with constraints coming from presolar oxide grains of group 2 . in section 3",
    "we integrate this by considering extra - mixing also in agb stages ; critical tests come again from presolar oxide grains ( of group 2 , but also of group 1 ) . the evidence from o - rich agb stars",
    "is also discussed .",
    "finally , in section 4 we comment on the information coming from c(n ) stars and we derive preliminary conclusions , also addressing the physical mechanisms necessary to drive the transport .",
    "for the sake of comparison with previous works we perform parametric calculations , using the free parameters @xmath13 and @xmath5 , as in nbw03 . we adopt the same nacre compilation for reaction rates and we compute our extra - mixing results as post - process calculations , starting from detailed stellar models by @xcite .",
    "masses in the range 1.2 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 2 for @xmath16 are considered ( only the case of a 1.5 @xmath2 star was analyzed in nbw03 ) . during rgb stages , we introduce extra - mixing after the `` bump '' of the luminosity function ( blf ) , when the h - burning shell erases the chemical discontinuity left behind by the first dredge up ( fdu ) ; hence envelope abundances do not change from fdu to this moment ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "details on the general rgb physics can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "our procedure was illustrated by @xcite and is based on the integration of a set of partial differential equations describing the abundance changes due to nucleosynthesis and to the upward and downward transport across the integration grid .",
    "the rate of mass circulation @xmath13 , defined in nbw03 , is assumed as a free parameter . in agreement with the above paper",
    "the fractional areas occupied by the upward and downward streams are assumed to be the same .    in the cases discussed here ,",
    "the results are essentially controlled by the path integral of reaction rates over the trajectory of the transport .",
    "they are shown , for the rgb phases of our three model stars , in figure [ one ] .",
    "the left panel shows our predictions for the oxygen isotopic ratios , as compared to measured values in presolar oxide grains of group 2 @xcite .",
    "these are the grains whose composition is attributed to extra - mixing phenomena , because of the extensive depletion of @xmath17o .",
    "the continuous track in the plot identifies the composition at fdu for various stellar masses .",
    "the dotted lines display the isotopic ratios obtained with efficient mixing ( @xmath13 = 10@xmath18 @xmath19yr ) continued from the blf to the rgb tip . along each line ,",
    "the displacement from the fdu composition increases for decreasing values of @xmath20 ; the points corresponding to some values of this parameter are shown with labels on the model lines .",
    "the results for @xmath21 0.10 and for very low @xmath17o/@xmath22o lay on an asymptotic trajectory with low slope pointing to a high @xmath23o/@xmath22o ratio ( 0.003 ) .",
    "this is determined by the equilibrium abundances of oxygen isotopes in cno cycling : at the low rgb temperatures ( @xmath24 k ) the concentration of @xmath23o is very high ( see nbw03 , figure 8) .",
    "it is clear that extra - mixing on the rgb alone does not account for the measurements in the most @xmath17o - poor grains .",
    "indeed , it would require a much higher content of @xmath23o than observed .",
    "the right panel of figure [ one ] adds more evidence by including the al isotopic ratio .",
    "the grid of dotted curves refers to extra - mixing calculations on the rgb for a 2 @xmath2 model : the results are however typical of the whole range of low mass stars .",
    "the curves roughly going from left to right are for @xmath13 values of 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 in units of 10@xmath18 @xmath19yr .",
    "the higher is the @xmath13 value , the larger is the @xmath17o depletion , as indicated by the labels .",
    "the almost vertical lines , instead , refer to different values of @xmath25 ( 0.2 , 0.15 , 0.1 , as indicated ) . it is clear that extra - mixing on the rgb might cover only al isotopic ratios below 10@xmath12 ; this is an irrelevant contribution , especially when considering that much more @xmath0al ( up to @xmath0al/@xmath1al @xmath26 5@xmath76@xmath2710@xmath28 ) is subsequently dredged up after thermal pulses on the agb ( even in the absence of further extra - mixing episodes on the agb itself ) .",
    "these simple comparisons make clear that deep mixing on the rgb alone is inadequate to explain the constraints coming from presolar grains of circumstellar origin .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite one can find generalities for agb stars . below their envelopes , conditions of chemical homogeneity are established when the downward envelope expansion called _ third dredge - up _",
    "( tdu ) , which follows the _ thermal pulses _ of the he shell , reaches down to the h - he discontinuity .",
    "most of the interpulse periods of agb phases are therefore suitable for the occurrence of extra - mixing , which can therefore operate for a total duration of about 10@xmath29 yr . the spread shown by presolar grains and by agb stars in the c , o and al isotopic ratios suggest that the details of the transport vary from star to star ( nbw03 ) .",
    "figure [ two ] ( left panel ) shows the oxygen isotopic ratios reachable by extra - mixing in the interpulse phases of agb stars .",
    "dashed lines show the effects of efficient mixing ( @xmath30 @xmath2/yr ) ; again the displacement from the fdu composition grows for increasing depth ( hence temperature ) reached by the transport ( @xmath25 values are indicated on the curves ) .",
    "model predictions converge to @xmath23o/@xmath22o @xmath26 0.0012 , characteristic of cno equilibrium at the moderately high temperatures found above the h - burning shell in low - mass agb stars ( @xmath31 k ) .",
    "the grain isotopic ratios cluster around this region and are well reproduced .",
    "the right panel of figure [ two ] adds the evidence provided by al isotopes .",
    "dashed lines show the region covered by models of deep mixing , if it occurs in both the rgb and the agb phases of a 2 @xmath2 star with @xmath32 .",
    "the previous activation of the same phenomenon on the rgb is considered by assuming initial isotopic abundances in the range obtained from the computations of section 2 .",
    "again , the grid of model lines shows cases with various @xmath13 values ( 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , 3 and 5 , in units of 10@xmath18 @xmath2/yr , higher @xmath13 values corresponding to higher @xmath17o consumption ) . the almost vertical lines of the grid refer to @xmath33 = 0.25 , 0.22 , 0.20 , 0.18 , 0.15 , 0.10 , 0.08 ( see the labels in the plot ) .",
    "the rgb sequences of figure 1 ( right panel ) are shown as dotted lines for comparison .",
    "the data of group 2 grains are well explained by the models , suggesting that they were formed in stars that experienced extra - mixing in both rgb and agb phases .",
    "it is well known that another mixing phenomenon occurs on the agb , for intermediate mass stars ( ims : @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is driven by the convective envelope extension down to the h - burning layers , in a process called hot bottom burning ( hbb ) .",
    "the isotopic mix of presolar oxide grains can not however be explained by this mechanism ; this was made clear in the works by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite revised the @xmath22o(p,@xmath35 ) reaction rate , essentially confirming the nacre value but reducing the uncertainty . on this basis",
    ", they found an equilibrium @xmath23o/@xmath22o ratio in their ims model of 2.52@xmath36 , incompatible with presolar grain data .",
    "they concluded that `` there is not clear evidence to date for any stellar grain origin from _ massive _ agb stars '' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) .",
    "the measurements of figure [ two ] cluster around an @xmath23o/@xmath22o ratio of 0.0012 , as typical of the shell h - burning temperatures in agb stars of masses up to about 2 @xmath2 . both lower and higher",
    "temperatures ( as found in rgb and hbb conditions , respectively ) would bring the model tracks outside the area of the measured data .",
    "this fact , when coupled with the abundances of @xmath0al in the grains , offers compelling evidence in favor of deep mixing in the agb phases of low mass stars .",
    "our results would not change significantly by adopting the reaction rate for @xmath23o+p from @xcite , as done by kcs10 : the differences in the equilibrium @xmath23o/@xmath22o values between this choice and the nacre one amount ( at maximum ) to 20% .",
    "one may further notice that , among the eight optically - visible , moderately - evolved ms and s stars observed by @xcite , four ( 50% ) have @xmath17o/@xmath22o ratios below 5@xmath2710@xmath12 , and two ( 25% ) around 2@xmath2710@xmath12 . despite the low statistics and large error bars of stellar observations ,",
    "this compares well with the family of oxide grains requiring extra - mixing .",
    "as an example , in the saint louis database ( http://presolar.wustl.edu/@xmath37pgd/ ) one finds 76 grains of group 1 and 79 grains of group 2 with @xmath17o/@xmath22o ratios lower than permitted by fdu . for 35% of the whole sample",
    "this ratio is below 5@xmath2710@xmath12 and for 17% it is below 2@xmath2710@xmath12 . among group 2",
    "grains alone these numbers become 68% and 33% , respectively .",
    "a straightforward interpretation is that visible o - rich agb stars represent an intermediate population , experiencing extra - mixing more effectively than the _ average _ of the grains , but less effectively than the _ extreme _ ( group 2 ) grains .",
    "this is encouraging . for a direct comparison",
    ", one would need oxygen isotopic ratios in evolved , extinct agb stars , which are the parents of most grains .",
    "they are however difficult to observe .",
    "conversely , stellar observations show an anti - correlation of @xmath17o/@xmath22o with c / o ratios that is reasonable to expect from agb evolution , but that can not be verified in oxide grains .",
    "extra - mixing seems therefore to be a common property of low mass agb stars ; and it must be a normal occurrence also on the rgb , as revealed by the low carbon isotope ratios of first - ascent red giants @xcite .",
    "notice , instead , that only few evolved stars are li - rich @xcite .",
    "however , producing li requires mixing at high rates , due to the short @xmath38be lifetime ; such fast mixing episodes might be found only rarely .",
    "our results indicate that extended mixing on the agb is required , when considering oxygen isotopes and @xmath0al/@xmath1al ratios in presolar grains .",
    "( in particular , the oxygen isotopes maintain their crucial role in constraining stellar physics , as early noticed by * ? ? ?",
    "stellar evidence also points to the same conclusion .",
    "this is so in particular for carbon isotopic ratios in c(n ) stars .",
    "indeed , while extra - mixing on the rgb is sufficient to explain such ratios ( averaging around 60 ) in the c(n ) star sample by @xcite , this is no longer true for the stars of @xcite .",
    "these authors agree rather well ( on average ) with @xcite for the sources in common ; however , they also identified a number of new c(n ) stars ( 25% ) with @xmath39c/@xmath40c ratios @xmath41 .",
    "mainstream sic grains provide the same evidence ( for 23% of them , in the st louis database , the carbon isotope ratio is below 40 , while the average value is around 60 , as for c(n ) stars ) .",
    "@xcite found that even assuming , at the beginning of the agb phase , @xmath39c/@xmath40c @xmath26 12 , as due to extra - mixing on the rgb , final c - isotope ratios in excess of 43 were always obtained at c / o=1 , unless new extra - mixing episodes on the agb were included .",
    "hence , c(n ) giants and sic grains confirm that extra - mixing occurs on the agb ; this is required also by their oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "the requirements from o - rich stars and grains suggest however a more extended processing than for c(n ) stars . as these last have , on average , a larger mass than ms - s giants @xcite , the extra - mixing efficiency in population",
    "i seems to decrease with increasing stellar mass . for lower metallicities ,",
    "extra - mixing effects are known to be enhanced @xcite .    in the kcs10 approach , c(n ) stars and sic grains with @xmath39c/@xmath40c ratios below about 33 ( see also their table 1 ) can not be explained , so that the constraints of sic grains and carbon stars with low carbon isotope ratios are not reproduced .",
    "note that the difference between the values found by @xcite and by @xcite for the @xmath39c/@xmath40c ratios in c - rich stars ( without extra - mixing ) is due to different choices for this same ratio at the end of the rgb phase , and for c / o .",
    "kcs10 also claim that they `` cover most of the range of observational data points '' .",
    "they refer to c stars in the galaxy and in the lmc clusters ngc1846 and ngc1978 . although their figure 2 might give this impression , this is not the case for the clusters .",
    "in fact , o - rich and c - rich stars in each cluster represent an evolutionary sequence , whose c / o and @xmath39c/@xmath40c ratios must be explained together .",
    "in contrast with this requirement , kcs10 need , for explaining c(n ) stars , initial c / o and @xmath39c/@xmath40c values of 10 and 0.32 ; for explaining o - rich agb stars they instead need 22 and 0.23 , respectively ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "kcs10 actually admit their inability at explaining the two constraints together ; this failure shows that their approach is not correct , at least for ngc 1846 .",
    "conversely , a scenario accounting for both o - rich and c - rich stars was presented by @xcite , introducing a moderate extra - mixing on the agb .",
    "these authors also suggested an increased efficiency of extra - mixing for increasing values of the envelope c / o ratio , because the bottom of the convective envelope becomes progressively closer to the h - burning shell while the star climbs the agb .",
    "for the same reason , the extra - mixing efficiency is expected to increase for agb stars of low metallicity , as the convective envelope becomes hotter for them @xcite .",
    "the situation of ngc1978 is definitely more puzzling @xcite : in that case , a fit to c - rich stars requires the concomitant absence of extra - mixing processes during both the rgb and agb phases .",
    "thus , it is hard to find a theoretical recipe suitable to reproduce the isotopic ratios of agb stars in ncg1978 ( both o - rich and c - rich ) without invoking an ad - hoc solution for this peculiar cluster ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the physical origin of extra - mixing on the agb .",
    "a popular mechanism is today thermohaline diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , it is unlikely that it occurs on the agb of population i stars , when any deep mixing has been previously active on the rgb .",
    "indeed , the envelope abundance of @xmath3he , whose burning drives the mixing through a @xmath9 inversion , would be considerably reduced .",
    "this is shown in figure [ three ] , where we plot the mean molecular weight across the radiative region in rgb and agb phases , for our 1.5 m@xmath42 star .",
    "while a @xmath9 inversion of @xmath43 ( continuous line ) is in fact driven by @xmath3he burning on the rgb , the agb cases ( dashed lines ) are more critical .",
    "they refer either to no destruction of @xmath3he on the rgb ( @xmath3he@xmath44 ) , or to a consumption by factors 3 or 10 ( this last case corresponds to the findings by kcs10 ) .",
    "it is evident that , for the masses and metallicities considered here , the @xmath9 inversion is either strongly reduced or erased if @xmath3he has been previously consumed .",
    "as extra - mixing ( hence @xmath3he consumption ) on the rgb of galactic disk stars is required by observations @xcite , the conditions for thermohaline diffusion might be suppressed in their agb stages ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "other mechanisms should therefore be looked for , including magnetic buoyancy @xcite .",
    "note that thermohaline mixing was found to occur on both the rgb and the agb ( first interpulses ) in a low - metallicity 1-@xmath2 star @xcite .",
    "this is due to the known higher inventory of @xmath45he in very low - mass stars @xcite .",

    "<S> we further show that , when extra - mixing occurs in the rgb phases of population i stars above about 1.2 @xmath2 , this consumes @xmath3he in the envelope , probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusion on the agb . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we argue that other extra - mixing mechanisms should be active in those final evolutionary phases . </S>"
