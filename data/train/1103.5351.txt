    "remarkably , most of the galaxies in the universe reside in small groups ( up to 70% in the nearby zone ; @xcite ) . nevertheless , relatively little attention has been devoted to groups with respect to their ` big brothers ' , galaxy clusters .",
    "groups , with typical masses around @xmath6 , are thus a key class of objects , containing a significant fraction of the overall universal baryon budget and being a nursery for massive ( early - type ) galaxies .",
    "galaxy groups are x - ray sources , with diffuse extended ( 50 - 500 kpc ) emission similar to that of rich clusters , but with lower luminosities , ranging from 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath3 up to several times 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath3 , with temperatures around @xmath9 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that clusters and groups do not follow the global scaling relations predicted by self - similar models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "groups are not perfect scaled down versions of clusters . if groups are sampled at sufficiently large radii , some x - ray scaling relations ( e.g. luminosity@xmath10temperature , mass@xmath10temperature ) seem similar to those followed by massive clusters ( @xcite ) , with the scatter increasing for @xmath11 kev . however , systematic differences between groups and clusters exist , with the former having clearly lower gas ( and baryon ) fractions and flatter entropy profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , groups have velocity dispersions of several hundreds km s@xmath3 , comparable to the internal velocity dispersion of individual galaxies . for this reason ,",
    "some processes are more ( merging ) or less ( ram - pressure stripping , galaxy harassment ) relevant than in clusters .",
    "the discrepancies between the observed scaling relations and the predictions of self - similar models , and especially the systematic differences between groups and clusters quoted above , can be explained by the presence of non - gravitational heating , acting during or after the gravitational collapse . in lower mass systems",
    "the same amount of energy per unit mass has a stronger effect .",
    "this is a key point for the mechanical agn feedback problem investigated here and in our previous work ( @xcite , g11 thereafter ) .    as in clusters and elliptical galaxies , many galaxy groups display the typical signatures of cooling flows ( a most notable example being ngc 5044 ) . in the center ,",
    "where the radiative cooling time is the shortest ( @xmath12 yr ) , the temperature of the intragroup medium ( igm ) drops by nearly 50% .",
    "moreover , the x - ray surface brightness is sharply peaked , with the maximum coincident with a massive elliptical galaxy .",
    "a large sample of x - ray groups is presented in @xcite .",
    "gathering 43 objects with _",
    "data , they confirmed the existence of a ` universal ' temperature profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the group profiles are slightly steeper than those of clusters for @xmath13 . in the inner cool core ,",
    "the scatter is significant : the majority presents positive gradients , while few are approaching a flat temperature profile ( a possible signature of a heating cycle ) .",
    "sun et al .",
    "produced also the entropy profiles , which retain the thermal history of the gas .",
    "they again confirmed previous important works ( @xcite ) , suggesting deviations in the entropy from the self - similar relation ( @xmath14 ) , showing a clear flat core , and an excess relative to massive clusters .",
    "one of the most striking riddles of galaxy group astrophysics concerns the so called ` cooling flow problem ' .",
    "this paper attempts to solve it , finding plausible consistent models , as has been done for galaxy clusters in g11 .",
    "the classical cooling flow ( cf ) model ( @xcite for a review ) predicts that , as the gas radiates , its entropy decreases , and thus gets compressed by the surrounding gas , causing it to subsonically flow inward .",
    "the estimated ( isobaric ) cooling rates is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 the mean molecular weight , @xmath18 the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 the proton mass .",
    "for typical luminosities of groups ( @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 ) , the relation implies cooling rates of several tens @xmath21/yr .",
    "such high predicted @xmath22 have been in contrast for years with the estimates of star formation rates and cold gas masses ( at least an order of magnitude lower ) , but the definitive observational evidence against the traditional cf model has been the spectral analysis of xmm - rgs spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) . + in the last decade the new generation _ xmm - newton _ and",
    "_ chandra _ telescopes have radically changed the panorama of the evolution of hot gas in groups and clusters .",
    "_ rosat - hri _ and , especially , _ chandra _ high resolution x - ray images show clear evidence of agn - gas interaction from giant elliptical galaxies ( ge ) to clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "evidences of such activity have also been identified in many groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fairly common presence of x - ray cavities , often coincident with lobes of radio emission connected to the core of the central galaxy by a radio jet , indicates that agn inject energy in the igm in kinetic form ( outflows ) and as relativistic particles .",
    "moreover , from dozens of giant ellipticals ( ge ) ( @xcite ) to rich clusters ( @xcite ) there is a continuous scaling relation between the agn power , associated with the cavity formation , and the core x - ray luminosity .",
    "this trend is more evident in low mass systems .",
    "although this connection is likely to be a necessary but not a sufficient requirement for a successful heating scenario , it strongly suggests that the dominant heating process manifests itself generating bubbles in the icm , through some kind of ` directional ' energy input , such as jets or collimated outflows ( rather than spherically symmetric forms ) .",
    "agn outflows seem to be a very promising mechanism to simultaneously explain the quenching of cooling flows ( and star formation ) , the deviation of scaling relations from self - similar laws and the presence of x - ray cavities and weak shocks in the intergalactic ( interstellar ) medium .",
    "as anticipated before , the impact of this type of heating is much more evident in less bounded systems , such as groups .",
    "we can therefore speculate that gentler outflows are more appropriate to regulate the thermodynamic evolution of the igm , while strong bursts should easily deform the main properties .",
    "+ regarding clusters , we can account for several variegated computations ( e.g. @xcite among others ) , but little work has been done to explore the role of agn heating on the intragroup medium , especially from a theoretical and numerical point of view . @xcite",
    "studied thermal heating ( plus conduction ) in 2d simulations , showing that this type of feedback , while very efficient in stopping the cooling process , often generates negative temperature gradients , with the total erasure of galactic cooling flows commonly observed in ge ( @xcite ) .",
    "carrying out cosmological simulations ( @xcite ) does not permit , nowadays , a detailed analysis of the feedback dynamics in the inner cool core , mainly because of the lack of resolution , and are thus more suited to study global sample - averaged properties .",
    "further , none of the above mentioned works has investigated a purely mechanical feedback . in this paper",
    "we will therefore describe , for the first time , 3d self - regulated hydrodynamical simulations of agn outflows in an exemplary galaxy group , lasting at least 7 gyr .",
    "the positive results of similar simulations for rich galaxy clusters ( g11 ) are a strong motivation for a detailed analysis of this ( mechanical ) feedback mechanism in lower mass systems .    as in g11",
    ", we assume that agn outflows are the key element in solving the cooling flow problem .",
    "the physical foundation is that the relativistic jet , produced by the active nucleus , entrains ambient gas , strongly decelerating within a scale - length of just a few kpc .",
    "such subrelativistic agn outflows have been observed in several cd galaxies in every band , thanks to blueshifted absorption lines : optical ( @xcite ) , uv and x - ray ( see @xcite for a review ) , 21-cm ( @xcite ; see also the references in g11 ) .",
    "they occur at a distance of a kpc with velocities around @xmath23 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the geometry of the bipolar outflows is still unclear , with usually narrow opening angles , and possibly some kind of precession .",
    "the timing of the feedback is also an important issue . from observations and from a ` thermostat ' assumption",
    "the duty cycle has to be similar to the cooling time , around @xmath24 yr .",
    "we will simplify the feedback self - regulation , testing hot ( bondi ) or cold accretion models with different mechanical efficiencies .",
    "fully 3d simulations are required to compute the chaotic and turbulent flow , with associated instabilities .    in summary",
    ", this work will focus on a set of heated cooling flow models with a variety of agn feedback mechanisms , aimed to answer the following key question : _ are agn outflows able to prevent the igm from cooling and at the same time preserve the observed cool core appearance for many gyr ? _",
    "in order to study the behaviour of agn outflows in galaxy groups , we carried out several simulations with a substantially modified version of flash 3.2 ( @xcite ) , a popular 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code .",
    "flash uses the message - passing interface ( mpi ) library to achieve portability and efficient scalability on a variety of different parallel high - performance computing systems .",
    "the simulations were usually run on 128 processors of ibm p575 power 6 ( sp6 ) at cineca supercomputing centre .",
    "we tested different numerical schemes to solve the hydrodynamic euler equations .",
    "as in g11 , we widely used the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) solver ( @xcite ) , particularly appropriate to describe shock fronts .",
    "it uses directional splitting to advect quantities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the instantaneous injection of the outflow not trivial , since we must manage two equal timesteps with a sweep @xmath25 and then @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we decided to also adopt other unsplit methods ( single timestep evolution ) .",
    "we tested roe and lax - friedrichs , with different slope limiters ( van leer , minmod , etc . ) .",
    "they work pretty well for smooth flows , but not for a powerful jet ignition , producing unstable results also with low courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) numbers ( @xmath27 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the hllc solver ( @xcite ) is very stable also for higher cfl numbers ( @xmath28 ) , with a good description of shocks and contact discontinuities . in the end ,",
    "results with both methods are comparable , with ppm being more accurate ( 3rd order ) , while hllc faster and more manageable . in many cases we preferred",
    "accuracy over speed .    the innovations implemented in flash reside , mainly , in several source and sink terms added to the usual hydro - equations .",
    "in conservative form : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 = \\rho\\bmath{v}\\cdot\\bmath{g}_{\\rm dm } + \\alpha \\rho_{\\ast}\\left(\\varepsilon_0 + \\frac{\\bmath{v}^2}{2}\\right ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gas density , @xmath35 the velocity , @xmath36 the specific total energy ( internal and kinetic ) , @xmath37 the pressure , @xmath38 the gravitational acceleration ( due to the dark matter halo plus the central elliptical , see below ) , and @xmath39 the adiabatic index . the temperature is computed from @xmath37 and @xmath34 using ( [ eos ] ) , with an atomic weight @xmath40 , appropriate for a totally ionized plasma with 25% he in mass .    in g11 we describe in - depth all the source and sink terms ( right hand side of the first three equations ) .",
    "here we give a summary .",
    "radiative cooling is modeled according to @xcite cooling function @xmath41 for a fully ionized plasma ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number density of electrons and ions ) . for typical groups ,",
    "the central metallicity @xmath44 is about solar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with a negative gradient at larger radii . for simplicity",
    ", we set the abundance equal to 1 z@xmath45 .    supernovae ia ( snia ) and stellar winds ( sw ) , in the central elliptical galaxy are implemented following @xcite , with a stellar mass loss rate @xmath46 dominated by stellar winds @xmath47 .    the key prescription for treating the cold gas is the dropout term ( eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) ) , proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "it removes the gas below @xmath49 k , whose physical evolution can not be properly followed by our code .",
    "because it has been proved that the total mass of cooled gas is insensitive to the presence of the dropout term or its functional form ( see @xcite ) , we can still calculate the gas cooling rate accurately .",
    "outflow source terms @xmath50 will be explained for every type of feedback in section 2.2 .",
    "injection will be done with two different methods : directly into the domain ( without a mass inflow ) or through boundary condition at @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we calculate the flow evolution for 7 gyr .",
    "local cosmological systems have very different formation times and are subject to relatively frequent mergers ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conservatively decided to run our simulations for such a long time to take into account the systems which do not undergo major mergers since @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , cool cores in massive objects may survive major mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , implying that the central agn feedback is continuously needed .",
    "note that several feedback schemes could delay excessive gas cooling for only 1 gyr before failing ( see g11 ) .",
    "thus , we stress that a few hundreds myr evolution is not sufficient to make predictions on the heating versus cooling regulation and might lead to misleading extrapolations .",
    "[ params ]    .parameters and properties of the most relevant models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we choose ngc 5044 as the template for a typical x - ray bright group of galaxies : all the results we present should be relevant for any object in this category .",
    "ngc 5044 was one of the first cool core groups observed , due to its high x - ray brightness , with low redshift 0.009 ( see @xcite , for recent chandra and xmm data ) .",
    "the estimated x - ray bolometric ( @xmath54 kev ) luminosity is around @xmath55 erg s@xmath3 , with a virial mass of @xmath56 @xmath21 .",
    "the large scale morphology is very smooth and nearly spherical , despite a little disturbance in the form of a south - eastern cold front . at the contrary",
    ", the core ( @xmath57 kpc ) has been strongly perturbed by recent outbursts from the central agn .",
    "the group presents many small radio quiet cavities with a nearly isotropic distribution and moderate mechanical power ( @xmath58 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the two biggest cavities at larger radii ( @xmath5 kpc ) are instead filled with radio emission at 235 mhz ( @xcite ) and the associated mechanical power seems to be able to balance radiative losses .",
    "the ngc 5044 x - ray image also shows several cold filaments coincident with h@xmath59 and dust emission , indicating a physical connection between the various gas phases ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gmrt observation ( 610 mhz ) reveals the presence of extended radio emission with a torus - like morphology , threaded by the largest filament ( probably cold material being uplifted from the center ) .",
    "the cooling time of the hot gas within the central 2 kpc is just @xmath60 yr . in the absence of feedback , a pure cooling flow model predicts tens of @xmath21/yr ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , while observations suggest the cooling rate is at least an order of magnitude lower , less than a few @xmath21/yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the key requirement for our computed models .",
    "this galaxy group consists of a luminous giant elliptical galaxy ( ngc 5044 ) surrounded by a cluster of @xmath61 low luminosity dwarf galaxies , mostly of early type .",
    "thus , we choose to model the elliptical galaxy with a de vaucouleurs profile ( @xcite ) with total stellar mass @xmath62 @xmath63 m@xmath45 and effective radius @xmath64 @xmath65 kpc ( @xcite ) . + we start our calculations with the hot gas in spherical hydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well generated by the total system mass .",
    "we use the observed @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xcite , see the dotted lines of fig .",
    "1 ) to calculate the total gravitational potential under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium . at the virial radius",
    "the gas fraction is @xmath68 , a reasonable value for x - ray bright groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "the computational rectangular 3d box in all of our models extends slightly beyond the group virial radius , @xmath69 .",
    "we simulate the @xmath70 half - space with symmetric boundary condition at @xmath51 , while elsewhere we set prolonged initial conditions with only outflow allowed . despite the amr capability of flash",
    ", we decided to use a number of concentric fixed grids in cartesian coordinates .",
    "this ensures a proper resolution of the waves and cavities generated in the cluster core by the agn outflows .",
    "we use a set of 10 grid levels ( basic blocks of @xmath71 points ) , with the zone linear size doubling among adjacent levels .",
    "the finest , inner grid has a resolution of 488 pc and covers a spherical region of @xmath72 kpc in radius . in general , grids of every level",
    "extend radially for about 40 cells .",
    "this simple method is the best way found to cover large spatial scales ( hundreds pc up to mpc ) and at the same time integrating the system for several gyr , using moderate computing resources .",
    "we adopt a purely mechanical agn feedback in form of nonrelativistic , collimated outflows .",
    "the implementation is similar to the galaxy cluster outflows of g11 . in considering massive slow outflows",
    ", we are implicitly assuming that the relativistic jet entrains some icm mass ( @xmath73 ) , or in a similar way , that radio jets are highly relativistic on pc scale , but rapidly decrease to subrelativistic velocities within few kpc from the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "as in g11 we show results only for models with cylindrical jets , with velocity parallel to the @xmath74axis .",
    "we have calculated few simulations with conical ( or precessing ) outflows and verified they have a similar impact on the global properties of the flow .",
    "in fact , the pressure of the surrounding gas collimates the outflows within few tens kpc . in this paper we will focus mainly on the two most successful models adopted for clusters in g11 : cold and bondi feedback .    in the cold feedback an outflow is activated only when gas cools to very low temperature within a spherical region @xmath75 kpc , and drops out from the flow .",
    "if @xmath76 is the mass cooled in the aforementioned region during a single timestep , the injected kinetic energy ( in the following timestep ) is given by : @xmath77    this energy is given to the hot gas located in a small region at the centre of the grid ( the ` active jet region ' ) , whose size is always @xmath78 cells ( @xmath791 kpc wide , 2 kpc high ) , containing a hot gas mass @xmath73 : @xmath80 we will see that the frequency and strength of the feedback events strongly depend on the mechanical efficiency @xmath81 , which has typical values @xmath82 ( see table 1 ) , almost an order lower than galaxy clusters .    in the bondi feedback the outflows are triggered by the usual prescription :",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is the volume - weighted hot gas density calculated within @xmath85 kpc , while @xmath86 is the mass - weighted sound speed in the same region .",
    "the assumed smbh has a mass of @xmath87 @xmath21 .",
    "the outflow energy is then calculated with eq .",
    "( 7 ) , using @xmath88 instead of @xmath76 .",
    "needless to say , the bondi radius , @xmath89 pc , is smaller than our resolution limit , so we refrain to attach a strict physical meaning to @xmath88 . in this sense",
    "the high mechanical efficiencies adopted for bondi models are due to the fact that the accretion should be considerably larger ( because of higher inner @xmath84 and lower @xmath86 ) .",
    "besides the two main feedback schemes , we experimented some variations in the agn generation , such as fixed intermittency , thermal feedback , direct linking between outflowing and accreting mass .",
    "these special models are often not successful and they will be briefly explained through sections 3.4 - 3.6 ( see also table 1 for a summary ) .",
    "+ for most of the presented methods we applied injection directly in the domain with @xmath73 , as stated above .",
    "in other simulations we tested also the injection of mass , momentum and energy flux through a ` nozzle ' in the grid boundary at @xmath51 .",
    "this way , the jet power is expressed as : @xmath90 with a nozzle area @xmath91 of @xmath92 cells and @xmath93 the initial central gas density .",
    "we fix the temperature of the jet to very low values , compared to the igm , in order to keep injected thermal energy on negligible levels compared to the kinetic flux .",
    "as noted also in g11 , the results do not greatly depend on the method of injection .",
    "however , the physical approach is a bit different : in the @xmath73 method we are directly modelling the entrainment , while in the nozzle injection we are specifying the properties of the ` subgrid jet ' .",
    "in this section we report the results of the various simulations , exploring different types of feedback and parameters .",
    "we have analysed in detail the long term behaviour of models similar to the most successful ones in g11 .",
    "some of the properties of unsuccessful - but pedagogical - models are covered in g11 .",
    "we stress again that the main objective of the present work is investigating the global properties of the flow , such as cooling rates and azimuthally averaged profiles ( density , temperature , etc . ) .",
    "cavities , shocks and iron abundances will be studied in - depth elsewhere through a dedicated set of simulations at higher resolution .      as a fiducial model , we ran a simulation without agn feedback , i.e. a pure cooling flow ( cf ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the flaws of the classical cooling flow model are clearly depicted in this evolution .",
    "both the density and ( mass weighted ) temperature profiles steepen considerably in the central region : the radiative losses induce a subsonic inflow of the gas , increasing the emissivity in a vicious cycle .",
    "this trend is relatively more evident and fast in the galaxy group , rather than in the cluster .",
    "after just 1 gyr the cooling rate has already approached a quasi steady state , with an asymptotic value @xmath94 @xmath21/yr .",
    "this is the clearest discrepancy with observational data and one of the main failure of the standard cooling flow scenario .",
    "the other two main observables , @xmath66 and @xmath95 , are also clearly wrong in the inner @xmath96 kpc ( see sec . 1 and 2.1 for the observational references ) .",
    "very cold gas , down to @xmath97 k ( which is soon dropped in our simulation ) , concentrate in the nucleus and generate non consistent gradients .",
    "our feedback models have to reduce this steepening , but preserving the cool core appearance at the same time . as said in sec . 1",
    ", galaxy groups present a more variable inner temperature profile respect to clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the heating must not destroy the inner structure ( see also @xcite ) , a quite demanding requirement .",
    "a typical signature of such a strong cooling flow is also the temporal increase of the bolometric x - ray luminosity : from @xmath98 erg s@xmath3 up to @xmath99 erg s@xmath3 at 7 gyr .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the global energetic budget , because the common ( misleading ) sense would probably associate the irradiated energy with , mainly , the drop in internal energy .",
    "however , the internal energy within @xmath100 decreases by @xmath101 erg ( that is , by less of @xmath102% ) , while the potential energy drops by @xmath103 erg , considering both the hot gas remaining in the grid and the cooled gas at the centre of the cluster .",
    "the kinetic energy stays always around @xmath104 erg and is therefore negligible .",
    "the conclusion is that energy is radiated away ( @xmath105 erg in 7 gyr ) mainly at the expense of the potential energy of the igm .",
    "this behaviour was less evident in the cluster , but still present .    in order to test the effect of numerical resolution on the cf results",
    ", we calculated a cf simulation with a resolution three times higher : the results are almost identical to the lower resolution run described above .",
    "therefore , with the adopted resolution our models are clearly in the convergence limit . + after placing the frame of the requirements for a successful feedback model , in the following we will describe the simulations with heating linked to agn outflows . in the next section",
    ", we will begin with the two best bondi models and then we will discuss , from higher to lower efficiencies , computations with worser results , alternating continuous and intermittent type of feedback .",
    "we begin to analyse the results of the simulations with agn feedback turned on .    the bondi accretion theory ( @xcite ) , although highly idealized with respect to the complexity expected in real accretion systems , has been widely used to estimate accretion rates on supermassive black holes , adopting eq .",
    "( [ bondi ] ) .",
    "despite our resolution is far from capturing the effective bondi radius ( tens of pc ) and despite the fact that the radiative cooling is important in the central region , we think that bondi accretion is still a useful , simple feedback prescription .",
    "in fact , the accretion rate is simply proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the entropy parameter .",
    "thus , bondi regulation is intrinsically a good ` thermostat ' : when the gas is cold and dense , the feedback is stronger , and vice versa .",
    "the first good model that we obtained is bondi accretion with efficiency @xmath109 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bondi_cont ] , second column ) , using the ` entrainment ' injection in the active region .",
    "the zone for the weighted quantities is @xmath110 kpc .",
    "the overall feedback is gentle and moderate , exactly as speculated .",
    "the mean cooling rate is well below @xmath111 of the pure cooling flow , with only a transient peak ( @xmath112 m@xmath45 yr@xmath3 ) at 1.5 gyr .",
    "an important feature for a successful continuous feedback , as seen in g11 , is stability in time .",
    "the moderate power stays around @xmath113 erg s@xmath3 , without strong variations , which allows to balance the instantaneous cooling rate in an efficient way .",
    "the mass - weighted temperature profiles are in agreement with observations in the nucleus of the group , with a smooth and almost flat curve . in the outer regions tiny acoustic oscillations",
    "are present , while between 10 - 30 kpc the continuous injection of energy tends to slightly overheat this region , especially at late times .",
    "the density profiles also show little variation from the initial observed ones , an indication that the gas is not accumulating and peaking in the core .",
    "another relevant consideration is that the bondi rate is always sub - eddington ( between @xmath114 eddington rate ) .",
    "observations of x - ray bright elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) also point towards similar values .",
    "the final injected energy is relatively low , @xmath115 erg ( @xmath116 erg for the bipolar outflow ) , compared to the total ` available ' bh energy @xmath117 erg ; roughly estimated as @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "this will be a typical feature of galaxy groups , in contrast to the high input energies of massive clusters , whose models can sometimes exceed the above quantity .",
    "furthermore , we tested several initial conditions and we concluded that the dynamics and results of our feedback models are , overall , not distorted by relatively different initial temperature and gravity profiles .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bondi_cont ] ( fourth column ) , we started the computation with an isothermal profile ( @xmath120 k ) , retrieving the density structure from a theoretical nfw plus devaucouleurs potential .",
    "after the first gyr of pure cf , the bondi feedback ( @xmath106 ) is again very effective in quenching the cooling flow and at the same time preserving the cool core appearance .",
    "a possible riddle for all continuous models remains the absence of frequent jet - inflated spherical cavities .",
    "the continuous agn activity ( mean @xmath121 km s@xmath3 ) carves a narrow tunnel of about 30 kpc in length , although its density contrast with the environment is large only for @xmath122 kpc ( and not particularly evident in the surface brightness maps ; see sec .",
    "4 ) .      in a self - regulated ( subgrid )",
    "mechanism we have to face substantially two problems .",
    "the first one is how much power to link to the feedback , while the second one is the right timing , i.e. when to turn on and off the heating machine .    in the following simulation ( figure [ fig : bondi ] , third column )",
    "we link the activation of the agn heating to the gas cooling , but use the standard bondi rate for the gas accretion onto the black hole . in other words , an outflow is generated when @xmath123 , with an energy linked to @xmath88 in the usual way .",
    "this feedback scheme tries to reproduce a self - regulated intermittency of the outflows ( ideal bondi models can only be continuous ) , with cycles of inactivity corresponding to moments of high hot gas entropy .",
    "in fact , when the gas begins to cool , it will usually start to flow towards the central black hole .",
    "this way , the temperature profiles are a bit more consistent with the observational data , especially at intermediate radii .",
    "although the jets are intermittent , their frequency is high , a condition that grants the quenching of cooling rate ( @xmath124 m@xmath45 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "the density profiles do not depart from the cool core status , without a strong steepening ( central values @xmath125 @xmath126 ) .",
    "bondi accretion rates are almost identical to bc5em2 , with the total energy injected in 7 gyr being a bit less : @xmath127 erg .",
    "the average jet power is also a factor of @xmath128 less , @xmath129 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this model clearly solves the problem of jet - inflated cavities in the igm .",
    "the ouflows duty cycle is roughly 80 - 85 per cent ( in the whole computation ) .",
    "the pattern is not very regular , in fact the cycle is more frenetic between 2 and 5 gyr , when the central gas has been heated efficiently .",
    "every time the jet ( with velocities usually of 8000 - 10000 km s@xmath3 ) turns on again , a bubble of small size ( @xmath130 kpc ) is seen in the density map .",
    "note that after a period of quiescence the subsequent injection produces a peak in the power , promoting the above mentioned cavity inflation through shock heating .",
    "the side effect consists in more evident perturbations in some @xmath131 profiles ( e.g. 3 and 7 gyr ) , however still compatible with typical galaxy group observations .    finally , during runtime we calculated , at every timestep , the efficiency ( @xmath132 ) that would have the cold feedback mechanism ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the result is striking : on average , the two schemes are almost coincident with @xmath132 around @xmath133 , except for few short timesteps , in which the cold feedback requires a 100 per cent efficiency ( because the cooled mass is almost zero ) .",
    "we begin now to describe models from higher to lower efficiencies , alternating again continuous and intermittent bondi methods .",
    "the following simulation is very computationally expensive , because the ( continuous ) outflow velocity rises often over @xmath135 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it is shown in figure 2 , third column .",
    "the cooling rate is quenched to fraction of @xmath21 yr@xmath3 after just a few gyr .",
    "the total injected energy is @xmath136 erg ( about 1.5 times greater the intermittent counterpart , next model bi1em1 ) .",
    "the consequence of this high energy deposition is a progressive steepening in the temperature gradient , with a moderate spike in the inner 4 kpc , where the jet is always active . during some timesteps the outflow reaches @xmath137 erg s@xmath3 , a quite strong power for bondi accretion .",
    "the compared efficiency analysis ( bottom panel ) shows that a cold feedback triggering could not even be possible in 20 - 30 per cent of the evolution , because it would break the unity threshold . in the other periods",
    "it would be associated with a value around @xmath138 .      the following ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bondi ] , fourth column ) is another computationally expensive model , which touches the limit of acceptability in the parameter space , for bondi models .",
    "the timing is again associated with the cold gas .",
    "the cooling rate is very similar to the precedent continuous model ( bc1em1 ) , with the reasonable range of 0.5 - 1.5 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 range , declining at late times .",
    "the density profiles are optimal , not altered from the initial data .",
    "temperatures start to feel the strong outbursts , which have sometime power in excess of @xmath139 erg s@xmath3 ( with velocity larger than @xmath140 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "in fact at later times the central gas is heated up to @xmath141 k , during some event .",
    "the associated cold efficiency has a common trend around @xmath138 , but with many oscillations after 3 gyr , reaching easily unity .",
    "notice that these moments last very few timesteps , after which @xmath132 reset to lower values ( in contrast to a first impression of the tight plot ) .",
    "when the efficiency is lowered to @xmath143 the heating provided by the feedback is considerable ( @xmath144 erg ) .",
    "this decreases the cooling rate down to at least 30 - 40 per cent of that of the pure cf ( figure [ fig : bondi_cont ] , first column ) .",
    "the profiles are close to the observed data , thanks to an always continuous outflow with velocity @xmath145 km s@xmath3 and power @xmath146 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the intermittent simulation is very similar to the continuous evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bondi ] , second column ) , except that , initially , the system is permitted to cool . without this early opposition , the outflows - with same power - can not halt the cooling so efficiently like in the previous case .",
    "the feedback finds an equilibrium only at 4 gyr , while at later times it will slowly increase , on the contrary of a reasonable self - regulated model .",
    "the associated efficiency of a @xmath147 model is near @xmath148 .",
    "in fact , we will see that the linked cold feedback model will produce an almost identical outcome , i.e. weak heating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmc ] , second column ) .      as a template for a typical weak model , a simulation with bondi efficiency of @xmath133 produce a cooling rate , which is identical to a pure cf run : @xmath150 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bondi ] , first column ) .",
    "the only clue for the presence of agn heating is that the profiles do not suffer a heavy decline with time , even if they posses a remarkable steep gradient ( @xmath131 down to @xmath151 k ) .",
    "the outflow is always continuous ( the model could be also named bc1em3 ) , with a very low velocity around 1000 km s@xmath3 and a power often under @xmath152 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "there is no possibility that this model will become intermittent at any time , due to the constant central cooling .",
    "the results presented in the previous section for the bondi accretion models suggest that , compared to galaxy clusters , groups require lower efficiencies of at least a factor of 10 . therefore , we start illustrating the cold feedback mechanism for the lowest adopted @xmath132 and then moving to more efficient outflows .    here",
    "we still use the entrainment injection method , with width and length of the active region 1 and 2 kpc ( 2 and 4 grid points ) , respectively . in g11",
    ", in fact , we concluded that the size of the jet and the type of injection do not change drastically the evolution of the feedback .",
    "as shown in the first top - left panel of figure [ fig : dmc ] , the cooling rate settles on a steady value around @xmath65 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this rate is obviously unacceptable , although reduced to the @xmath155% of the pure cf model value .",
    "with such a low efficiency , the azimuthally averaged , mass weighted temperature and density profiles are only slightly modified by the heating and do present the excessive accumulation of gas near the center , typical of the cf model . in the center",
    "the temperature is @xmath156 k and the numerical densities @xmath157 @xmath126 .",
    "the outflows , typically have a power of @xmath146 erg s@xmath3 and a velocity of @xmath158 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the total injected mechanical energy is in fact quite low , @xmath159 erg , and the outflows are almost continuous , because they are never able to stop the cooling flow .",
    "given the rare period of inactivity , the ` duty cycle ' is @xmath160 per cent .    at the end of the simulation @xmath161",
    "m@xmath45 have cooled and dropped out of the hot phase .",
    "the vast majority of gas cools at the very center .",
    "if all the cooled gas were accreted onto the central black hole , as we have simplistically assumed in this scheme , the final bh mass would result about an order of magnitude greater than the expected one . in principle , we could avoid the problem of the excessive black hole mass by assuming that only a fraction of the cooled gas actually accretes on it with a higher efficiency ( see sec .",
    "3.6 , inout models ) .",
    "as anticipated , the next step is to increase the efficiency , in order to find a more suitable heating power .    in the following model , where the efficiency increased by a factor of five , @xmath162 we obtain in fact a jet power of @xmath163 erg s@xmath3 and velocity oscillating around 5000 km s@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmc ] , second column ) .",
    "however , the cooling rate is only slightly reduced to @xmath164 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 and radial profiles tend to be similar to the ones of previous model .",
    "the difference is that now the curves decline at 6 kpc , instead of 10 kpc .",
    "evidently , the outflows deposit their energy in more inner zones .",
    "we conclude that , even if the total injected energy reaches almost @xmath165 erg , at this stage the cooling flow is not quenched in a successful manner .",
    "this is also underlined again by the almost continuous presence of the outflows .      at @xmath167",
    "we finally recover a successful heating evolution . as in previous computations , at early time ( first gyr ) the radiative cooling prevails over the outflow mechanical heating and the cooling rate reaches a peak of 4 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 .",
    "however the long term evolution presents different intriguing results . after 2 gyr",
    "the system becomes much more turbulent and chaotic , inducing a reasonable amount of mixing , that permits the gas circulation and reheating in a very efficient way , also in the 5 kpc nucleus .    as shown in the third column of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmc ] , the temperature in that region is almost constant , with values close to that observed for ngc 5044 ( @xmath168 k ; @xcite ) .",
    "this very important feature is also described by the density curves : a gradual flattening of the central profile is seen through the entire evolution .",
    "it is striking that the 7 gyr ( black ) profile is practically superposed to the initial fit . at that time",
    "( redshift = 0 ) the cooling rate is @xmath169 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 , about 7% of the pure cf run , a significant suppression which brings the value of @xmath170 in reasonable agreement with the observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shock waves generated by the outflows , with power usually between @xmath171 erg s@xmath3 , are not strong enough to significantly alter the global positive temperature gradient , although small amplitude ripples are present .",
    "these waves correspond to weak shocks associated with the jet propagation and are visible up to a distance of @xmath172 kpc .",
    "they are not so evident as in galaxy clusters because the energy involved here are two or three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "in fact the total jet energy is @xmath173 erg .",
    "the gas is typically ejected with @xmath174 km s@xmath3 .    furthermore , an important difference between clusters and groups is the duration of each event . in cluster models ,",
    "a duty cycle of 0.1 was quite usual , because the very short super - eddington bursts could stop instantly the cooling flow , with the consequence of perturbed profiles , near the ignition time . here , our estimated duty cycle is roughly 0.85 .",
    "therefore the situation is reversed : successful cold feedback models in groups require an almost continuous heating , with short pauses of tens myr .",
    "notice that the eddington luminosity , @xmath175 erg ( for a @xmath176 m@xmath45 black hole ) , is far above the regime of the current model .",
    "in fact the accretion rate oscillates between @xmath177 the eddington rate .",
    "as seen in section 3.4 , a @xmath178 jet can easily erase the cool core structure of the group .    in summary",
    ", the analysed behaviour of c5em4 seems to be similar to that the quiet bondi feedback . in the bottom panel",
    "we have calculated , at every timestep , the associated bondi accretion rate and the required @xmath179 to reproduce the same instant mechanical energy . as a striking result , a bondi efficiency of @xmath180 , especially after 2 gyr",
    ", is retrieved from this analysis . only in a few events , the cold mechanism detaches from the regular regime of bondi , because of its intrinsic impulsivity .",
    "nevertheless the similitude is quite evident and indeed , if we compare the two outcomes of both models ( especially intermittent bondi , fig .",
    "[ bondi ] , third column ) , they appear deeply connected also in a quantitative manner .      increasing the efficiency by a factor of 2 generates another positive model , with some features approaching the borderline of a violent disruptive heating .",
    "in fact , with a jet power up to @xmath139 erg s@xmath3 , the cooling flow is perfectly stifled , asymptotically decreasing to a fraction of @xmath21 yr@xmath3 after a few gyr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmc ] , fourth column ) .",
    "the beginning of the violent regime is quite evident in the averaged profiles , which now tend to oscillate in a large @xmath182 kpc region .",
    "overall , the cool core is conserved , but the temperature indicates some overheating in the nucleus at later times .    with our adopted active region , in a few outbursts , the velocity is greater than @xmath183 km s@xmath3 line , while the outflow mass rate is several tens @xmath21 yr@xmath3 , as in all previous @xmath184 models .",
    "this is a clear indication that at higher efficiencies we will approach a relativistic regime and a catastrophic heating ( we will not show here results for @xmath185 but see fig .",
    "5 of g11 for an analogous model for clusters ) .",
    "the equivalent bondi efficiency for model c1em3 is sometimes 0.5 or more , difficult to justify .",
    "the total injected energy of c1em3 is similar to the previous successful model , a sign of a good self - regulation in the global feedback process .",
    "this energy can be compared with the total energy radiated away , @xmath186 erg ( in the simulated half - space @xmath187 ) .",
    "interestingly , the present heating provides more energy than that lost by radiation ( @xmath188 erg ) .",
    "notice that , in every described model , the total outflow energy ( for the full - space system ) is about an order of magnitude lower than the available bh energy ( @xmath189 erg ) .",
    "the evolution of the energetics is very similar to the description presented by g11 .",
    "the core kinetic energy increases after every intense agn outburst , but it is soon dissipated and transformed into potential energy through the expansion of the igm .             in this series of models we want to decouple the simulation from the self - regulation engine , in order to control some important agn outbursts parameters .",
    "for example , it is interesting to fix the frequency of the outflows . in g11",
    "we found that intermittent outflows , with jet duration of 5 myr and activated every 10 myr , are very effective in inhibiting gas cooling preserving the correct temperature and density profiles in galaxy clusters .",
    "this agn activity cycle agrees with observations of acoustic ` ripples ' in perseus cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the models described in this section we do not insert an ad hoc velocity , but we retrieve its value from setting a constant power , here taken equal to @xmath191 . thus @xmath192 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we choose the ` nozzle ' injection method , therefore the velocity is constant : 7000 km s@xmath3 . note that the efficiency is irrelevant in the computation .    as a result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : extra ] , first column ) , the cooling rate is less than a few @xmath21 yr@xmath3 , for several gyr , and shows a slow increase after 4.5 gyr , up to 4 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged density profiles are almost superposed to the observations , with a slight decrease in time , becoming flatter .",
    "thus , like in bondi models , the radiative cooling is significantly reduced by the simulated heating process . using the nozzle injection ( essentially an outflow with negligible height ) produce a spike in the very few kpc , while at radii greater than 10 kpc the fluctuations from initial @xmath66 are almost zero . as expected , shock heating is more vigorous in the nucleus when the outflow is injected through the boundary , while more effective at intermediate radii , when the entrainment method is adopted .    in this type of intermittent models",
    "it is not granted that the feedback produces evident cavities .",
    "in fact with a cycle of 5 - 10 myr the head of the jet cocoon almost touches the backflow tail of the last bubble .",
    "thus , we expect that with a duty cycle greater than 50 per cent the jet becomes practically continuous .      keeping the same cycle scheme ( 5 - 10 myr ) , but increasing the power by a factor of 10 produces a typical ` exploding ' simulation ( not shown ) .",
    "the temperature profile gets a very steep negative gradient , as soon as the outflow ignites , destroying the entire cool core and generating a ` plateau ' in @xmath67 .",
    "the cooling rates are obviously zero , but with unacceptable observables .",
    "on the other hand , with a much lower power ( @xmath194 erg s@xmath3 ) @xmath195 approaches 12 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 after just 1 gyr .",
    "generated bubbles are quite stable and , being slowly inflated , show cold rims in the early phases .",
    "nevertheless , the density and temperature profiles resemble those of a classical cooling flow , with less peaked gradients .",
    "we can conclude that , even with fixed intermittency , an acceptable agn feedback model should not approach an eddington regime ( like proposed in some analytical works , e.g @xcite ) , at least in galaxy groups , where a strong burst can easily wreck the delicate thermodynamic structure of the core .      keeping a fixed jet power , as in our acceptable model int510 m , but this time varying the duration of the agn activity , leads to models that must be rejected .",
    "indeed , when every outflow event has a duration of 1 , 2.5 or 3.3 myr the intermittent feedback becomes quite ineffective in halting the inflowing cold gas : the central gas density slowly grows with time until radiative cooling prevails over heating , causing the cooling rate to surpass the threshold of acceptability .",
    "for example after just 1 gyr , with 3.3 myr duration , the cooling rate is over 7 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 and the temperature curve turns very similar to those of model cf .    on the contrary , when the jet duration exceeds 5 myr",
    "the inflated cavities disappear , because the different outbursts melt rapidly in a ten kpc zone , producing an almost continuous injection .",
    "the consequence is a steep @xmath131 gradient at the center , which can halt the cooling flow , but without self - regulation it easily overheats the system .",
    "it is worth noting that one difficulty of a pure kinetic outflow ( often called ` momentum - driven ' ) is that it can easily carve a tunnel in the surrounding igm if the ram pressure of the jet ( @xmath198 ) is much larger than the thermal pressure ( @xmath199 ) of the gas .",
    "thus a feedback with high kinetic energy will advance undisturbed in the group core , depositing its energy at intermediate radii ( @xmath200 kpc ) . at the base ,",
    "the cold gas accumulates in a torus - like manner .",
    "this is especially evident at early stages of a momentum - driven outflow .",
    "the successful models , we found , are able to quench cooling flow , because at some point the generated turbulence induces strong mixing in the gas , also in the very center",
    ". therefore the circulation inside the jet path makes shock heating very effective . in our models",
    "the turbulence is sustained only by the agn feedback .",
    "it is likely that this process dominates in the very central region of the system , although turbulent and bulk motions caused by cosmological accretion , usually very subsonic , may also contribute ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the high density gas in the torus cools efficiently and triggers the agn feedback in an almost continuous way .",
    "it is physically reasonable that a part of the jet power is converted in thermal energy , especially during the entrainment process .",
    "based on these considerations , we simulated some models with a fraction of the total injected energy in the form of thermal energy , through the nozzle .",
    "we kept the bondi prescription for the feedback method .",
    "as pedagogical purpose , we first set the fraction of @xmath201 as 99 per cent the total energy .",
    "this setup is similar to the model of @xcite with loading factor of 100 and bondi efficiency 0.1 .",
    "as expected , the first powerful outflow ( over @xmath113 erg s@xmath3 ) destroys the entire thermodynamic structure of the cool core : the produced shock ( with temperatures above @xmath202 k ) is almost spherical .",
    "this is another indication that the group necessitates a much more delicate heating compared to a cluster . lowering the efficiency to",
    "@xmath133 still generates a similar catastrophic heating .    on the other hand , keeping the above efficiency , but reducing the fraction of @xmath201 to @xmath196 or @xmath203 results in models overall similar to purely kinetic ones .",
    "one major difference are small puffs at the base of the jet , that enable more turbulence .",
    "the problem is that , in the inner @xmath204 kpc , temperature profiles show a spike , due to injected @xmath201 .",
    "another interesting effect is the enlargement of the tunnel carved by the outflow , because of the increased internal pressure , compared to the momentum - driven one .",
    "the best model seems to be eth50 ( not shown ) , with @xmath205 thermal energy and efficiency @xmath206 .",
    "the feeble jet is almost always continuous , with velocity 3000 km s@xmath3 , but the thermal energy injection generates a break - up in the jet structure , which fragments in small buoyant bubbles of size @xmath207 kpc ; a very interesting feature that is seen in ngc 5044 ( @xcite ) .    we conclude that a good fraction of thermal energy associated with the agn feedback can help the deposition of heating at very small radii , reducing the cold torus at the base of the jet and fragmenting the outflow in small size bubbles . at the same time , however , it is difficult to obtain a flat or positive ( mass - weighted ) @xmath131 profile",
    ". we will expand this analysis in a future work , with very high resolution .",
    "one problem of self - regulated feedback models is how much of the gas contributes to the growth of the black hole mass .",
    "needless to say , with a resolution of @xmath208 pc we can not consistently estimate the accretion rate onto bh .",
    "as noted in some works ( e.g. , @xcite ; g11 ) part of inflowing gas onto a black hole could be thrown back by the generated outflow , perhaps through entrainment .",
    "therefore only a fraction of the accreting mass , @xmath209 , might actually be captured by the black hole . from another perspective , we can see this as a reduced total efficiency .",
    "that being stated , we computed some models in which we attempt to track the part ( @xmath210 ) of infalling gas that really increases the bh mass .",
    "the residual fraction ( @xmath211 ) is considered the active mass of the outflow : @xmath212 note that in these models it is better to use the nozzle injection mode , in order to totally control the outflowing mass , without altering the internal domain .",
    "an interesting feature of this method is that the outflow velocity is practically constant , dependent on @xmath213 ( and @xmath81 ) .",
    "an observational constrain of the outflow velocity may thus give hints about this ratio between infalling and outflowing matter .",
    "setting @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) and efficiency @xmath133 , the outflow , coming out of the nozzle , has a velocity around 7000 km s@xmath3 . with cold accretion ,",
    "the power of the jet presents strong oscillations between @xmath152 and @xmath139 erg s@xmath3 while the cooling rate approaches in a few gyr the pure cf simulation .",
    "even with bondi accretion ( same efficiency ; fig .",
    "[ fig : extra ] , second column ) , which , in theory , is more regular , the ( high ) outflow power can not find a stable balance in time , resulting in @xmath216 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 at 7 gyr .",
    "while some accretion events reach 4 - 5 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 , the produced strong feedback does not last long enough .",
    "in fact the total injected energy is very low : @xmath217 erg .",
    "it is interesting that the radial profiles of this model ( io1 - 9 ) show a cool core , with the exception of a central negative temperature gradient .",
    "therefore , overall acceptable mean @xmath131 and @xmath218 profiles do not necessary imply that the system is not cooling .    trying to increase",
    "the efficiency is a serious problem for the inout model , because the velocity will constantly overtake 50000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we could lower @xmath210 in order to increase the jet mass , but with just 1 per cent of accreting mass ( probably unrealistic ) the velocity will still have very large values .",
    "the only solution , we have found , is to return back to the ` entrainment hypothesis ' and multiply @xmath219 by a factor @xmath220 ( like a mass loading factor ) . following this assumption , with @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    ", we could enhance the bondi efficiency ( @xmath223 ) to obtain an acceptable cooling rate , below 5 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : extra ] , third column ) , after the small bump at 1.5 gyr .",
    "now the velocity has a value of @xmath224 km s@xmath3 .",
    "with @xmath225 the average cooling rate is further reduced , asymptotically decreasing to 1 @xmath21 yr@xmath3 ( fourth column ) .",
    "both simulations generate some of the best radial profiles , which keep the cool core appearance for the entire evolution time , almost ` glued ' to the initial ( observed ) condition .",
    "this is an indication that the feedback has returned stable ( around @xmath226 erg s@xmath3 ) , gentle and continuous , very similar to successful bondi models ( sec .",
    "notice that the accretion rate is again sub - eddington .",
    "overall , a pure inout model exhibits a spasmodic behaviour , because of the intrinsic linking between accreting and outflowing matter , which can be smoothed out only by introducing a mass loading factor .",
    "however , this parameter is nowadays unknown and therefore its value is chosen ad hoc , in order to retrieve reasonable jet velocities .",
    "it is therefore simpler and cleaner to adopt the usual entrainment feedback of the main models ( sec .",
    "3.2 - 3.3 ) , seeing that the results are analogous .",

    "we will analyse physical quantities , such as gas density , and other astronomical observables , i.e. integrated emission - weighted maps .",

    "the diameter of the channel is usually 4 - 5 kpc , collimated in the inner region by the thermal pressure of the surrounding gas . at 14 kpc , where the jet ram pressure becomes comparable to the thermal pressure of the ambient gas ( @xmath231 erg @xmath126 ) , the outflow structure becomes perturbed and more turbulent k ( see also fig . [ fig:1dcut ] ) . ] .",
    "in fact , near the tunnel , instabilities are visible , a signature of further igm entrainment and turbulent mixing .",

    "the fact that the global cool core appearance is not greatly modified , is another key result .",
    "although the continuous outflow generates a tunnel , the overall initial structure is conserved . on the other hand , increasing the efficiency of bondi models leads to a wider v - shape channel , which begins to dominate the core of the group .",

    "the 1d cut through @xmath243 kpc ( fig . [ fig:1dcut ] ) clearly confirms the presence of this kind of rim , a drop of temperature ( about 40% ) coincident with the high x - ray emission ( at @xmath244 kpc ) .    in panel p",

    ". therefore , the young bubble ( panel c ) still buoys undisturbed in the igm , generating a slight asymmetry in the iron distribution along jet axis , over the more uniform background .    at this time we caught indeed the early injection phase of the outflow .",
    "a quasi cylindrical cocoon envelops the core of the jet , which has now a velocity around 3000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the injected initial velocity was over @xmath240 km s@xmath3 , meaning that the jet commonly decelerates in a rapid way after few kpc . at @xmath249 kpc",
    "the emission - weighted temperature reaches the maximum value of @xmath250 k ( panel g ) , clearly indicating the effect of shock heating . around the contact discontinuity",

    "notice that the maps of this model are very similar to those of c5em4 , another successful model , which has analogous bubbles production .",
    "this behaviour confirms further the strict relationship between ( intermittent ) bondi and cold models , as previously noted by the compared efficiency analysis .",
    "the last row of maps displays another snapshot , typical for intermittent ( self - regulated ) feedback models , like bi1em1 . the big outburst and the generated bubble",
    "have been vanished , leaving the system in the aforementioned turbulent phase , in which mixing distributes the low residual heating to the central igm . soon after this period",
    ", the gas will cool and start the inflow .",
    "the velocity field is relatively chaotic ( panel d ) , with maximum velocity of 640 km s@xmath3 , a bit lower than local speed of sound , evidently decreasing in the turbulent zones .",
    "the mixing of gas at this epoch restores the spherical symmetry of the cool core , with average temperature of @xmath253 k ( panel h ) .",
    "this is underlined also by the symmetric surface brightness map ( panel n ) and by the substantial diffusion of fe in the intermediate zone , @xmath254 kpc ( panel r ) .",
    "note that the abundance radial profile at the very center is , however , more peaked during this quiescent cooling flow phase ( @xmath255 z@xmath256 ) , compared to the agn outburst period .",
    "thus , our agn models might also explain the dichotomy of cool core and non cool core groups , having the former higher central abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature , captured at this stage ( often present after an agn outburst ) , is the sequence of very small ` bubbles ' at @xmath257 kpc , with typical diameter of a few kpc .",
    "the origin of this tiny ` bubbles ' is the fragmentation of the jet due to turbulent and chaotic motions , previously discussed . in this map",
    "they are in a very late phase , almost disappearing in the ambient medium . in this case",
    "they would be probably not detected in the x - ray ( just a 10 per cent jump in surface brightness ) . to capture their signature ,",
    "an observation should be done at an earlier evolutionary moment , after a big event , when the jet is rapidly collapsing .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that @xcite find exactly this type of configuration in ngc 5044 : few big cavities and many small ` weather - driven ' bubbles , which appear to be radio quiet ( i.e. not directly inflated by the jet ) .",
    "+ overall , we conclude that the agn outflows dynamics is particularly complex , as expected from the previous study in galaxy clusters .",
    "the main stages of evolution for the best models are : ( i ) a gentle continuous outflow , which sustains the cooling flow for the majority of time ( or always in bc models ) and which is barely observable in sb@xmath233 maps ; ( ii ) a phase of large cavity inflation , with cold rims and high density / sb@xmath233 contrast ( only for non - continuous models ) ; ( iii ) small periods of quiescence in which the turbulence and vorticity promotes mixing and tiny weather - driven ` bubbles ' .",
    "the presence of the above described features ( big and small cavities , asymmetry of fe abundance , low mach shocks , etc . ) , is consistent with several recent x - ray observations of heated systems , and demonstrates the fundamental role of agn driven outflows in the evolution of groups ( and clusters ) .",

    "in this paper we have proposed 3d numerical simulations of self - regulated agn outflows in a galaxy group environment .",
    "we have followed the long term evolution of the interaction between two main characters : radiative cooling and feedback heating .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand the general features of the feedback process to solve the cooling flow problem , i.e. quenching cooling rates , but , at the same time , preserving the global cool core structure .",
    "we tested two relevant models , which we had found to be successful in galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) : cold feedback and bondi feedback mechanisms .",
    "galaxy groups , with masses @xmath79 two order of magnitude less than big clusters are more fragile systems and the feedback must be consequently more delicate . in the following we discuss and summarize the main results obtained , along with merits and flaws of the models .      in the first set of simulations the commonly adopted bondi prescription is applied to evaluate the accretion rate onto the black hole . although the bondi scenario is quite naive , it can be treated as the template model for a typical self - regulated feedback directly linked to entropy . the efficiency , as free parameter , might just incorporate the discrepancies between the ideal bondi model and the real dynamics .",
    "overall , we found ( similarly to clusters ) that the bondi accretion models are able to satisfy our strict requirements for a plausible evolution , with a mechanical efficiency in the range @xmath1 . as expected , the accretion rates are always two to three orders of magnitude lower than eddington limit .",
    "this implies that the outflow ` touch ' is always delicate and non - explosive , with power of the order of @xmath113 erg s@xmath3 and velocity @xmath240 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these values are consistent with numerous observations of agn outflows through absorption lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the",
    "best models cooling rates are reduced below a few or fraction of @xmath21 yr@xmath3 , with a monotonic decrease in time .",
    "the density radial profiles of these models do not deviate too much from the observed ones .",
    "the same can be said of the temperature gradient , with a small overheating in the inner 4 kpc nucleus .",
    "the last feature is probably associated with the continuous nature of the feedback : the bondi formula is in fact based on the accretion of hot gas , whose reservoir never drains",
    ".    a problem for this model may be the continuous injection of energy , which carves a tunnel in the igm . however , as shown in section 4 , this channel is usually very narrow and almost disappears in the surface brightness image ( on the contrary of events associated with big bubbles ) .",
    "the important result is that a feeble continuous heating could operate , without being in contradiction with observations .",
    "the creation of cavities of tens kpc is another issue .",
    "however , we have noted that , during the increasing generation of turbulence ( due to the agn ) , the jet becomes gradually more disturbed : eventually it will fragment , producing a series of small buoyant bubbles . this phenomenon is certainly enhanced by a cosmological evolution through merging and other large scale motions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    we have also checked that slightly different initial conditions , like an initial isothermal temperature profile and a nfw dark matter profile , do not alter the behaviour of the feedback , producing similar results .      in galaxy clusters the triggering mechanism linked to the instantaneous @xmath147 induced a very powerful outburst , often super - eddington . in much less massive galaxy groups such a powerful feedback would easily destroy the thermal structure observed , producing negative temperature gradients up to 100 kpc .",
    "therefore , successful models adopt efficiencies about an order of magnitude lower with respect to those used for clusters . with @xmath132 between @xmath167 and @xmath133 cooling rates are still well below 10 per cent of the pure cf model , but now with consistent central densities and temperatures .    the model is naturally impulsive , but this time the duty cycle is very high compared to the cluster evolution shown in g11",
    "in fact , for the majority of time the outflow is continuous with moderate power , similar to the previous bondi models .",
    "the agn stays in a quiescent phase only 15 - 20 per cent of the time , after which it will ignites with outbursts up to @xmath139 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "these powerful jets are essential for creating big bubbles of 10 - 20 kpc diameter .",
    "one of such event has been analysed in section 4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "the bubble does not show high temperature within ( e.g. @xmath258 k or more ) , like in clusters ( g11 ) : it is very under - dense with respect to the ambient medium , with a relatively large contrast in the sb@xmath233 map ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "it is striking that the metal abundance is often highly asymmetric , enhanced along the outflow direction .",
    "all the previous features are commonly present in deep x - ray observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "overall , it is surprising that , in galaxy groups , models with cold feedback resemble , most of the time , simulations with bondi accretion , with the merit of adding important features like x - ray cavities and ripples at larger radii ( essentially weak shocks with mach around @xmath260 ) .",
    "this fact clearly indicates the necessary properties of the feedback process , if outflows are the main mechanism : very frequent or almost continuous and gentle .",
    "simulations using the third class of models , bi , have been carried out to test the combined effect of bondi accretion and cold triggering mode , in order to avoid bondi continuous injection ( intrinsic in the ideal case ) . in some preliminary tests ( here",
    "not shown ) , we found that a simple superposition of the two feedback schemes leads to unacceptable models , because the outcome is just a more powerful jet , which carves a larger and deeper continuous channel .",
    "therefore , we tried another way to combine both methods . keeping bondi accretion prototype ( entropy - regulated ) for the value of power , we assumed that when the gas begins to cool at the center ( i.e. the inflow initiates ) , the feedback is activated .",
    "this will prevent too peaked instantaneous outflow powers and , at the same time , the agn activity acquires a sort of duty cycle .",
    "the results are very encouraging .",
    "the required bondi efficiency for best models stays again in the range @xmath1 .",
    "assuming @xmath261 , the evolution manifests the typical flaws of a pure cf run . on the contrary , if @xmath262 the feedback becomes very explosive and easily ` burns ' the cool core .",
    "the best bi models show instead radial profiles with gradients not far detached from the initial observed state , along with very low cooling rates ( usually one or less solar masses per year ) .",
    "the look of the bi simulations has been analysed , in - depth , in section 4 .",
    "the general features are almost identical to the previous discussed models",
    ". extensive periods of a continuous bondi - like injection ( @xmath263 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath264 km s@xmath3 ) produce a narrow heating channel , alternated with dormant agn phases ( @xmath265 ) . as in the cold feedback computations",
    ", the short inactivity promotes the subsequent generation of outbursts with greater power ( 3 - 4 times more than the continuous phase ) , producing important observed features , such as tens of kpc cavities and oscillations in the flow quantities .",
    "it is relevant to note that , as in previous good cold models , only a fraction of the injected mechanical energy is used to inflate cavities ( usually under 50 per cent , panel b , is @xmath266 erg @xmath267 @xmath268 erg , while injected mechanical energy is @xmath269 erg .",
    "thus , inflation energy is just 37% of the total injected energy in that single event . ] ) .",
    "one of the main results , also pointed out in g11 for clusters , is that the success of a feedback crucially depends on how the energy is transferred to the surrounding medium , not only on the total amount of available energy .",
    "furthermore , the heated flow has a very complex dynamics , with numerous facets .",
    "after the mechanical energy is injected in the system , a part of energy inflates the bubble , but the rest generates the cocoon and weak shocks . when the jet is more continuous , the moderate energy released at intermediate radii induces a turbulence growing in time .",
    "these chaotic motions permits a more efficient circulation of the hot gas , promoting the deposition of energy through mixing at the base of the jet , where the cooling tends to dominate .",
    "furthermore , while the system becomes more turbulent , the feeble jet can be fragmented and can cyclically produce tiny ` bubbles ' , few kpc in size ( albeit very faint in the sb@xmath233 map ) .",
    "their buoyant motion may promote additional mixing and heating , helping the global feedback process .",
    "quite simple feedback models still generate an amazing variety of heating processes .    as a concluding remark for these models , the efficiency comparison underlines again the strict relationship with the cold best models , exactly around @xmath270 .",
    "we can therefore affirm that the feedback in galaxy groups , able to quench cooling flow but at the same time preserve the cool core structure , is globally only of one type : moderate , gentle , often continuous and turbulent , with very short periods of inactivity and following outbursts .",
    "it is also interesting to highlight the main features of unsuccessful models , in order to understand why some kinds of feedback do not work .",
    "first of all , while a small part of the total energy injected could be in thermal form , above a threshold fraction of @xmath271 % the center of the group becomes too hot with respect to the observations ( see also brighenti & mathews 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "injection of a modest amount of thermal energy can have the beneficial effect of disrupting the otherwise ordered structure of the outflows ( section 3.5 ) .",
    "this model intermittently eliminates the long tunnel , usually not observed in real systems .",
    "moreover , the deposition of heat in the nucleus helps preventing the formation of a cold torus .",
    "injection of thermal energy can be justified assuming that shocks heat the hot igm in the very central region .",
    "another rejected model considers the active outflowing mass directly linked to the real accreted mass onto bh ( inout feedback , section 3.6 ) .",
    "the main problem here is that , even with very low @xmath210 ( e.g. @xmath272 ) , the jet velocity often exceeds @xmath97",
    "km s@xmath3 .",
    "this unappealing result can in principle be fixed adding a mass loading factor ( @xmath273 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , this assumption will mimic entrainment , just as our standard outflow generation method described in section 2.2 .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that we recover acceptable results , similar to those described in sections 5.1 .",
    "intermittent models ( section 3.4 ) , with fixed jet power , are only partially acceptable , as was also found for galaxy clusters ( g11 ) .",
    "the most successful run has relatively weak outflows ( @xmath274 , activated every 10 myr , with a duration of 5 myr each ( model int510 m ) .",
    "we have also tested jets with eddington power ( @xmath275 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "as expected they will destroy the cool core generating systems very different from the real ones .",
    "probably the major flaw of the intermittent models is their artificial nature .",
    "cooling rates can be suppressed , compared to a pure cf model , but the temperature profiles oscillate strongly in the center .",
    "this further supports the common notion that heating _ must _ be self - regulated .",
    "finally , we have briefly investigated the effect of jet precession ( not shown ) .",
    "important parameters like inclination angles and revolution time of the jets are currently poorly known .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the behaviour of cold gas at the base of the outflow , i.e. the formation of a small cold torus , is not greatly different from non - precessing models .",
    "in fact , the heating channel will be again generated after the first episodes , getting a tilted orientation in respect to a normal @xmath228-axis cylindrical simulation .",
    "as expected , our simulations show that agn heating has a deeper impact in galaxy groups than in clusters , because the same mechanical power per particle has a greater effect for a lighter , less bounded systems .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , a jet with eddington power can easily erase the entire thermodynamic structure of the cool core .",
    "the same applies for all the self - regulated simulations with very high efficiencies ( @xmath276 for cold models ; @xmath277 for bondi ) . in g11",
    "we showed that consistent cold models commonly produced super - eddington outbursts ( @xmath278 erg s@xmath3 ) , with a very low frequency ( @xmath57 per cent ) . despite the huge power injected , the shock - heating phase could not destroy the observed density and temperature gradients , and the cluster quickly restored the usual cool core .",
    "the only marked consequences were more ripples at larger radii and cavities , which in the early phase presented high internal energy and shocked rims .    on the contrary , galaxy groups , with much less binding energy ( per particle ) , can not recover from the same strong impulsive feedback . in order to prevent such ` heating catastrophe ' , cold feedback models in galaxy groups require an efficiency at least @xmath279 times lower .",
    "the outcome is striking , because the evolution resembles that of bondi models , with low power jets ( @xmath280 erg s@xmath3 ) activated in a quasi - continuous gentle way . these outbursts occurring after short quiescence periods ( tens myr )",
    "generate @xmath65 kpc cavities surrounded by relatively cold rims in the region close to the center of the group , similar to some observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . unlike in galaxy clusters , cavities in groups",
    "present the usual low density contrast , with temperatures similar to the surrounding medium .    the best models assuming continuous bondi accretion , on the other hand , are equivalent in both clusters and groups ( except for the efficiency , lower in groups ) .",
    "accretion rates always follow a sub - eddington regime .",
    "the moderate outflows carve a narrow tunnel in the intergalactic medium ; we showed , in this paper , that it is very faint in the sb@xmath233 map and thus hard to resolve .",
    "the absence of inflated bubbles is still a riddle of this type of feedback .",
    "notice that in galaxy clusters the low - power outflows ( @xmath281 ) had more difficulty in halting the massive cooling flow ( tens @xmath21 yr@xmath3 ) , showing more peaked density profiles .",
    "therefore , in clusters , cold accretion was slightly favoured as an acceptable model .",
    "another common feature in both clusters and groups is the asymmetrical distribution of metals ( mostly iron ) produced by the snia in the central galaxy .",
    "they tend to accumulate along the jet axis , in qualitative agreement with recent observations ( see sec .",
    "4 ) . in all the consistent group models",
    "the sub - eddington outflow powers imply that the total injected energy ( a few @xmath165 erg for the full - space system ) is always an order below the total ` available ' bh energy .",
    "in fact , during the simulated evolution , the black hole mass increases at most 10 per cent in bondi models . in the cold feedback model",
    "the lower efficiencies imply a much higher @xmath282 , similarly to galaxy clusters . as noted in g11 , however , the real efficiency ( still unknown ) could just be higher , with a lower mass actually falling onto the bh .",
    "our simple approximation of the real sub - pc accretion does not allow to answer why the efficiency in groups should be a factor 5 - 10 smaller than in clusters , aside the observational requirement .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this topic with a dedicated analysis .",
    "here we summarize the main conclusions of our study .",
    "\\i ) feedback triggered by both bondi accretion and cold mode accretion ( or a combination ) lead to successful self - regulated models .",
    "these schemes are able to quench cooling flow for many gyr , preserving the observed thermal structure of relaxed groups .",
    "the required mechanical efficiencies for cold accretion models are in the range @xmath0 , while @xmath1 for the bondi scenario .",
    "+ ii ) in the galaxy group , the two main feedback schemes generate similar flows .",
    "the global evolution is dominated by almost continuous outflows , with sub - eddington power ( @xmath280 erg s@xmath3 ) and velocities around @xmath283 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these values are consistent with those based on observations of agn outflows ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ iii ) the main feature of the continuous phase is a narrow tunnel ( large a few kpc , up to 30 kpc long ) , which is almost undetectable in the sb@xmath233 map .",
    "the tunnel is periodically fragmented by the increasing agn - driven turbulence , especially when the bh is in a phase of low accretion .",
    "the products are tiny , kpc - size buoyant bubbles , which help the mixing of the igm .",
    "these faint features are very difficult to detect , but seen in a few systems , most notably ngc 5044 ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ iv ) cold and hybrid accretion models show short quiescent periods ( summing to a @xmath265 of the evolutionary time ) .",
    "each quiescent period is followed by a relatively strong outburst , with power about an order of magnitude larger than the typical value during the continuous phase .",
    "the consequence is the creation of relatively large cavities ( @xmath5 kpc ) , with high density contrast , in approximate pressure equilibrium with the ambient . the emission - weighted temperature in the cavity region , however , is not far above those of the surrounding medium .",
    "feeble rims , relatively cold in the region near the center and slightly hotter in the more distant part , with somewhat higher iron abundance , are also present .",
    "these features are again reminescent of real systems ( @xcite for a review , @xcite ) .",
    "+ v ) the asymmetrical transport of metals , along jet - axis , up to 40 kpc , is clearly visible during the active phases . in quiescent periods ,",
    "the moderate turbulence promotes metal diffusion .",
    "recent observational data confirms this behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ vi ) finally , the global point of all our computations : the only possible way to heat a galaxy group , in order to suppress the grip of the cooling flow , appears to be through a quasi - continuous ` delicate touch ' , while in massive clusters rare and explosive strokes are mildly favoured over the weaker bondi regulation .",
    "this quite different feedback evolution might explain the common observed discrepancies between the two cosmological actors .",

    "<S> agn heating , through massive subrelativistic outflows , might be the key to solve the long - lasting ` cooling flow problem ' in cosmological systems . in a previous paper </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that cold accretion feedback and , to a lesser degree , bondi self - regulated models are in fact able to quench cooling rates for several gyr , at the same time preserving the main cool core features , like observed density and temperature profiles . </S>",
    "<S> is it true also for lighter systems , such as galaxy groups ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is globally yes , although with remarkable differences . adopting a modified version of the amr code flash 3.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we found that successful 3d simulations with cold and bondi models are almost convergent in the galaxy group environment , with mechanical efficiencies in the range @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary storyline of galaxy groups is dominated by a quasi - continuous gentle injection with sub - eddington outflows ( with mechanical power @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath4 km s@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cold and hybrid accretion models present , in addition , very short quiescence periods , followed by moderate outbursts ( 10 times the previous phase ) , which generate a series of @xmath5 kpc size cavities with high density contrast , temperatures similar to the ambient medium and cold rims . </S>",
    "<S> after shock heating , a phase of turbulence promotes gas mixing and diffusion of metals , which peak along jet - axis ( up to 40 kpc ) during active phases . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel , produced by the enduring outflow ( hard to detect in the mock x - ray surface brightness maps ) , is easily fragmented , producing tiny buoyant bubbles , typically a few kpc in size . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to galaxy clusters , the agn self - regulated feedback has to be persistent , with a ` delicate touch ' , rather than rare and explosive strokes . </S>",
    "<S> this evolutionary difference dictates that galaxy groups are not scaled - down versions of clusters : agn heating might operate in different regimes , contributing to the self - similarity breaking observed .    </S>",
