    "hot x - ray emitting interstellar medium ( ism ) carries important information about the history of star formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the metals in the ism in early - type galaxies have been enriched by type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and stellar mass loss . since sne ia do not produce o or mg , abundances of these elements in the ism reflect stellar abundances .",
    "thus , the abundance pattern of the ism can play a key role in studying the origin of metals .",
    "the asca satellite first enabled us to measure the metal abundances in the ism of the early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies have about 1 solar iron abundance , employing a multi - temperature plasma model @xcite , or considering uncertainties in the fe - l atomic data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton measured the metal abundances and spatial distributions of metals in the ism of the early - type galaxies , because of their large effective area and good angular resolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular ngc  5044 , ngc  1399 , and ngc  4636 , the abundances of non - fe elements have good constraints with chandra and xmm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed abundance patterns are consistent with the solar ratio .",
    "however , o and mg abundances of relative faint x - ray galaxies still remain highly uncertain , due to a highly asymmetric energy response in the low - energy region below 1 kev and a strong instrumental al line of these missions , respectively .",
    "the suzaku xis @xcite has an improved line spread function due to a very small low - pulse - height tail below 1 kev , with a lower and more stable background level compared to the chandra acis and the xmm - newton epic .",
    "the abundance patterns in the ism of several giant elliptical galaxies , including ngc  1399 and ngc  1404 @xcite , ngc  720 @xcite , and ngc  4636 @xcite , have been revealed by recent suzaku observations .",
    "the derived fe abundances of the ism are about 1 solar , and the abundance patterns are close to that of the new solar abundance determined by @xcite . from these results ,",
    "the contribution of sne ia and stellar mass loss to the metal enrichment of the ism and intracluster medium were discussed . however , ngc  4382 is the only s0 galaxy whose ism abundance pattern has so far been derived with suzaku @xcite .",
    "the o / fe ratio of the ism in this galaxy is smaller by a factor of two as compared to than those in the four elliptical galaxies .    in terms of the cosmology dominated by cold dark",
    "matter , it is considered that at least some elliptical galaxies were formed by a hierarchical formation scenario , in which larger spheroidals were assembled relatively late through mergers of the late - type galaxies of comparable mass ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , s0 galaxies in clusters of galaxies are considered to be formed through morphological transformations , from infalling gas - rich spiral galaxies to gas - poor s0 galaxies .",
    "this is because spiral galaxies were much more common , and s0 galaxies were much rarer , in distant than nearby galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in spite of these differences",
    ", the elliptical and s0 galaxies have been treated together in most of the past studies . however , since there are possible differences in the formation scenario , we need to study the elliptical and s0 galaxies separately .",
    "the abundance pattern of stars reflects their formation history , since a longer formation time provides a higher concentration of trapped sne ia products to the stars .",
    "if the elliptical and s0 galaxies have different formation histories , their stellar metallicity and/or present sn ia rate may be different .",
    "the stellar metallicity of the early - type galaxies has often been investigated in optical observations of their central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , there may be systematic uncertainties in the assumption of the age - population of stars , and in atomic physics .",
    "also the values of solar abundances have changed enormously , considering the three - dimensional hydrostatic atmosphere and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in contrast , x - ray observations of the ism , show much simpler atomic data and temperature structures as compared to those in the optical spectra , and we can observe the entire region of each galaxy , although the metals in the ism are a mixture of those from stars and recent sne ia . considering these , further x - ray studies of s0 galaxies are thought to be important .",
    "ngc  1316 is a peculiar s0 galaxy , with numerous tidal tails .",
    "this galaxy has a surprisingly high central surface brightness , and a lower velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 = 227@xmath433 km s @xmath5 ; @xcite ) for its galaxy luminosity than other elliptical galaxies with similar luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "due to these features , ngc  1316 has been thought to have undergone a major merger relatively recently .",
    "the merger age is estimated to be @xmath63 gyr , based on the age of the bright globular clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , ngc  1316 is good target for investigation of the galaxy formation process through mergers .",
    "measurements of the absorption - line indices of the central region , or 1/10 @xmath7 of ngc  1316 , indicates a small overabundance of @xmath8-to - fe ratio of [ @xmath2]=0.15 ( @xcite ) , which is smaller than the [ @xmath2]@xmath60.3 , in center of the giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . here , @xmath7 is the effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "these line indices also indicate a somewhat younger age of 35 gyr @xcite .",
    "rosat observations of ngc  1316 detected a thermal emission component from hot ism @xcite , using chandra data of an good exposure of 25 ksec , @xcite found that the ism has a temperature in the 0.50.6 kev range and a 0.38 kev luminosity of 3.1@xmath10 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the metal abundance of the ism were reported to be 0.21.3 solar adopting the solar abundance table by @xcite .",
    "ngc  1316 hosts radio lobes , that generate inverse - compton x - rays as well as synchrotron radio emission ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "a recent suzaku observation detected the inverse - compton x - ray up to 20 kev utilizing suzaku from the west lobe @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze suzaku xis data of ngc  1316 .",
    "we use a distance of 18.6 mpc to ngc  1316 based on the hubble space telescope measurements of cepheid variables @xcite , and a redshift of 0.005871 including proper motion @xcite .",

    "this model well reproduced the spectra , with @xmath18/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath19 455/360 .",
    "however , the strength of the power - law representing the cxb was about twice as high as that of @xcite .",
    "we consider that this is due to contributions by other sources in ngc  1316 , such as the radio lobes and integrated low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the index of the power - law component from the radio - lobes is 1.68 @xcite .",
    "the integrated spectra from discrete sources in the early type galaxies are approximated with a power - law model with an index of 1.6 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we added a power - law component , `` power - law@xmath20 '' , with its index fixed at 1.6 , and then fitted the spectra with the following model ( i ) : phabs @xmath11 ( power - law@xmath21 + power - law@xmath20 + apec@xmath12 + apec@xmath13 ) + apec@xmath14 .",

    "the normalization of power - law@xmath20 was not linked between the two regions , because the number of lmxbs may increase toward the galactic center , and the brightness of the radio - lobes may be different .",
    "all the other background components were constrained to be the same between the two regions .",
    "the normalizations of the ism components in the background region were fixed at 0 .",
    "the results of these fits are summarized in figure [ figure2 ] and table [ table2 ] .",
    "several emission lines seen around 0.50.6 kev , 0.60.7 kev , @xmath6 1.3 kev , and @xmath6 1.8 kev are identified with k@xmath8 lines of o , o , mg , and si , respectively .",
    "the emission bump around 0.71 kev corresponds to fe - l complex , as well as to k - lines from ne and ne .",
    "these fits are not formally acceptable , mainly , because of discrepancies between the fi and bi spectra of the background region above 2 kev .",
    "although this discrepancy might be related to some remaining problems with the nxb subtraction , they are unlikely to affected the ism modeling . the 1 t model results in @xmath26 kev .",
    "the fit statistics shown in table [ table2 ] clearly favor the 2 t model , which gives the two temperatures as 0.48 and 0.92 kev .",
    "the abundance of fe does not depend very much on the temperature structure of the ism .",
    "adoption of the 2 t model shows , the fe abundance of the ism as 0.581.15 solar .",
    "this value is consistent with the ism metallicity of 0.42.1 solar derived from the chandra observation derived by @xcite . here",
    ", the value was converted using the solar abundance table by @xcite .    in order to examine the abundance ratios rather than their absolute values , we calculated confidence contours between the abundances of metals ( o , ne , mg , and si ) and of fe , using the 2 t model for the ism .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ figure3 ] and table [ table2 ] .",
    "the elongated shape of the confidence contours indicates that the relative values are determined more accurately than the absolute values .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] the shows metal - to - fe ratios in ngc  1316 using the 1 t and 2 t models for the ism , which were derived from the two - parameter confidence contours shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "the o / fe ratio varies from 1.7 with the 1 t model to 1.1 with the 2 t model in solar units . on the other hand ,",
    "the ne / fe ratio changes considerably , from @xmath63 solar with the 1 t model to @xmath61 solar with the 2 t case .",
    "we note that the ne abundance is not reliably determined due to an overlap with the strong and complex fe - l line emissions .",
    "the 1 t and 2 t models give similar values for the mg / fe and si / fe ratios .",
    "( , ) figure4.eps      we also tried to fit the same spectra with the three - temperature vapec model for the ism .",
    "the derived temperature of the third component has a large error , and the fe abundance increased to 1.03@xmath27 in solar units .",
    "meanwhile , the derived abundance ratios are consistent with those from the 2 t model . to examine the dependence on the power - law@xmath20 component , we fitted the spectra and allowed the index to vary freely .",
    "then , the index decreased to 1.20 , but the abundances did not change significantly . systematic uncertainty associated with the contaminants on the xis optical blocking filter",
    "is less than the statistical errors .    the derived icm component in subsection [ gal ]",
    "are including both icm and ism components .",
    "considering the point spread function of suzaku x - ray telescope , @xmath6 30 % of the icm component in the background region escaped from the ism emission in the galaxy region @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ism emission may extend up to the background region .",
    "therefore , we added another temperature component in the background spectra , and fitted the spectra again .",
    "we got almost the same values for the ism component in the galaxy region .",
    "this is because the normalization of the icm component in the galaxy region is only 10 % of that of the ism , as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .    because the fits were not formally acceptable , we explored using the c - statistic giving less biased values than @xmath18 statistic for poisson - distributed data @xcite .",
    "the results of c - statistics fitting hardly improved , @xmath18/d.o.f.=939/701 , and the parameters and their errors were almost the same .",
    "the large @xmath18 mostly comes from the systematic errors of xis . for examples , because the response matrix of xiss around the si edge has some problems , the energy range between 1.82 and 1.84 kev was also ignored in the spectral fitting @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath18/d.o.f improved to 906/691 .",

    "the large @xmath18 are almost due to systematic uncertainties in the background and calibrations of xis .",

    "convolving the response matrix of xis , the difference in the fe - l lines between apec @xcite and mekal @xcite models are typically 10% .",
    "therefore , we fitted spectra in the same way as in section [ gal ] but including 10  % systematic errors within an energy range of 0.751.2 kev .",
    "the derived parameters are summarized in table[table2 ] , and @xmath18/d.o.f became 859/692 .",
    "the error range in absolute value of each element increased , and the derived fe abundance became 0.71.8 solar .",
    "however , increases in the error ranges of the abundance ratios were smaller .",
    "furthermore , ignoring an energy range of 1.821.84 kev , and above 2 kev in the background spectra , the @xmath18/d.o.f became 605/569 .",
    "we successfully measured the abundance patterns of o , ne , mg , si , and fe in the ism of the s0 galaxy ngc  1316 with suzaku . figure [ figure4 ] summarizes the results .",
    "we used the new solar abundance table by @xcite . adopting the result of the 2 t model fit",
    ", the abundance pattern in the ism in ngc  1316 is shown to be close to that of the new solar abundance .",
    "the abundance patterns of the sn ii and sn ia yields are also plotted in figure [ figure4 ] . here",
    ", the sn ii yields by @xcite refer to an average over the salpeter initial mass function of stellar masses from 10 to 50 @xmath28 , with a progenitor metallicity of @xmath29 .",
    "the sne ia yields were taken from the w7 model @xcite . the abundance pattern in the ism of ngc  1316 lies between those of sn ii and sn ia , and is consistent with their mixing .",
    "assuming that the o / fe ratio of the sn ii yield is 3.5 solar ( @xcite ) , then @xmath670% of fe in the ism is synthesized by sne ia , and originates from present sne ia and from those trapped in stars .",
    "since the 2 t and 3 t models give the fe abundance of the ism of 0.61.6 solar , the fe abundance from sne ia would be 0.41.1 solar .",
    "the fe abundance synthesized by present sne ia in an early - type galaxy is proportional to @xmath30 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . here",
    ", @xmath31 is the fe mass synthesized in one sn ia , @xmath32 is the sn ia rate , and @xmath33 is the stellar mass loss rate .",
    "fe in the hot ism of the galaxy is mainly produced from sne ia , since sne ii synthesized far more o and mg than fe .",
    "we used the mass - loss rate from @xcite and assumed the age to be 13 gyr , which is approximated by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the age in units of 15 gyr and @xmath36 is the b - band luminosity .",
    "@xmath37 produced by one sn ia explosion is likely to be @xmath38 @xcite . adopting 0.10.5",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 as the optically observed sn ia rate ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , the resultant fe abundance is 2.914.5 solar , when considering only the sne ia contribution .",
    "therefore , the expected sne ia contribution is sufficiently high to supply the fe in the ism of this galaxy .",
    "as indicated from the optical line indices ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ngc  1316 may contain younger stellar populations . in this case , both the stellar mass loss rate and sn ia rate might be higher ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of sn ia rate is approximated by power - law model : @xmath41 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where @xmath42 is the age of stars .",
    "then , assuming an age of 3 gyr , the contribution of sne ia to the fe abundance decreases by a factor of 0.7 .",
    "since a significant proportion of stars in ngc  1316 might be older than 3 gyr , the effect of stellar age on the metal - enrichment by present sne ia would be less than a few tens of a percent .",
    "then , the difference in the abundance pattern of the ism of the early - type galaxies reflects the difference in the abundance pattern of the stars in the entire galaxy .    since a longer star - formation time - scale yields more sne ia products in stars , the differences in the @xmath8/fe ratio in stars can constrain the star - formation histories . the abundance pattern of o , ne , mg , si , and fe in the ism of ngc  1316 is close to that of the elliptical galaxies , have been obtained by chandra , xmm , and suzaku ( e.g.@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",

    "considering the expected high contribution from the present sne ia , the observed solar abundance pattern in the ism of ngc  1316 indicates an overabundance of @xmath43 $ ] in stars in the entire galaxy as in these elliptical galaxies , although optical observations indicate that stars in the central 1/10 @xmath7 region of ngc  1316 contain more sn ia products than those in the giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "suzaku observed the ism of the entire galaxy and revealed the abundance pattern in stars over the entire galaxy .",
    "the abundance pattern of the s0 galaxy , ngc  4382 was also investigated with suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  4382 is a normal s0 galaxy located on the outskirts of the virgo cluster .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] also shows that the o / fe ratio of the ism in ngc  4382 is smaller , by a factor of two , as compared to that of ngc  1316 .",
    "the different abundance patterns of these two s0 galaxies reflect a higher amount of sne ia products in the ism of ngc  4382 .",
    "measurements of optical line indices indicate that stars in the most central region ( @xmath44 ) of these two galaxies have similar @xmath43 $ ] ratios ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as shown above , the effect of stellar age on the fe abundance of the ism from the present sne ia might be small , but stars in the entire ngc  4382 may contain more sne ia products than those in the entire ngc  1316 .",
    "these results suggest differences in the metal enrichment histories and hence in the formation and evolution histories of the ism in the merger remnant , ngc  1316 , and the normal s0 galaxy , ngc  4382 .",
    "optical observations reveal that the @xmath2 ratio of the stars in the central regions of elliptical and s0 galaxies depends on the system mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature of the ism of ngc  4382 is about 0.3 kev ( @xcite ) while and those of ngc  1316 and the ellipticals are more than 0.5 kev , as shown in figure [ figure4 ] . since the temperature of the ism reflects the system mass , the differences in the abundance patterns in the ism of the two galaxies may also reflect the dependence of the @xmath2 ratio of stars in the entire galaxy on the system mass .",
    "in addition , the abundance pattern of another s0 galaxy , ngc  1332 was searched with xmm and chandra @xcite .",
    "although the temperature of the ism of ngc  1332 is @xmath45 0.5 kev , the @xmath2 has large error to compare with other s0 galaxies , as shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "further studies to obtain , more samples of the elliptical and s0 galaxies with different ism temperatures would enable us to understand the formation process of the early - type galaxies in more detail .",

    "<S> the suzaku x - ray satellite observed the nearby s0 galaxy ngc  1316 , a merger remnant aged 3 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the total good exposure time was 48.7 ksec . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were well represented by a two - temperature thermal model for the interstellar medium ( ism ) plus a power - law model . </S>",
    "<S> the cool and hot temperatures of the thermal model were 0.48@xmath0 and 0.92@xmath1 kev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent spectral sensitivity of suzaku enables for the first time to measure the metal abundances of o , ne , mg , si , and fe in the ism . the resultant abundance pattern of o , ne , mg , si , and fe is close to that of the new solar abundance determined by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured abundance pattern is compared with those of elliptical galaxies and an s0 galaxy , observed with suzaku . </S>",
    "<S> considering the metal - enrichment from present type ia supernovae , the near - solar abundance pattern of the ism in ngc  1316 indicates an enhanced @xmath2 ratio of stellar materials in the entire galaxy , like in giant elliptical galaxies . </S>"
