    "a few years ago a study of the broken symmetry phase of the 3@xmath0 z(2 ) ( ising ) class has brought compelling evidence that universality has a much wider reach than usually expected . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the ising model and the lattice regularized @xmath3 theory both exhibit a rich spectrum of massive excitations and that mass ratios coincide in the scaling region  @xcite .",
    "this result is quite far from obvious : since only the lowest mass contributes to the free energy , there is no simple reason why higher masses in the spectrum should be universal .",
    "later on , numerical evidence has been given that the same spectrum characterizes ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(2 ) gauge theory at finite temperature in the scaling region above the deconfinement temperature  @xcite .",
    "in the deconfined phase of the su(2 ) gauge theory the counterpart of the massive excitations in the broken phase of the 3@xmath0 ising model are the so - called _ screening masses _ , i.e. the inverse exponential decay lengths of correlation functions between suitably defined operators , built from the polyakov loops  @xcite",
    ".    it would be quite interesting to extend the test of the universality of the spectrum in two different directions : ( 1 ) by considering a theory with a global symmetry different from z(2 ) , which , however , presents in its phase diagram a second order critical point in the 3@xmath0 ising class ; ( 2 ) by verifying if and to what extent the universality of the spectrum holds also in the broken symmetry phase near a _ weak _ first order phase transition .",

    "if this claim is true , an important consequence would be that mass ratios in the broken phase near criticality of the 3@xmath0 3-state potts model at zero magnetic field should reproduce the corresponding ratios in the phase of broken z(3 ) symmetry of the ( 3 + 1)@xmath0 su(3 ) pure gauge theory at finite temperature .",
