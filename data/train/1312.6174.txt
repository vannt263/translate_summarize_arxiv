    "in this supplementary material we first show that the inter - particle interaction of the @xmath35 shape , used throughout the present study , appears naturally in the context of the `` rydberg - dressed '' atoms .",
    "so , it is possible to verify all the predicted physics within presently available experimental setups .",
    "next , we demonstrate how to control the number of humps and fragmentation ratio in the ground state of the bosonic system with such an inter - particle interaction trapped in simple barrier - less traps , also see ref .",
    "we also show how to distinguish fragmented systems studied here from the condensed ones , by means of the correlation functions .",
    "finally , we provide the full movies of the time - dependent evolutions in 2d and 3d setups , discussed in the main text .",
    "let us start from the issue of possible experimental realizations of the predicted physics .",
    "to observe the predicted effects the first necessary condition is that the length / range of the inter - particle interaction should be comparable with the length of trapping potentials .",
    "the second necessary condition is that the interaction should be strong enough .",
    "we expect to observe the formation of few - hump fragmented ground states in trapped ultra - cold systems made of `` rydberg - dressed '' atoms [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "let us discuss how to realize the predicted multi - hump muti - fold fragmented physics in  rydberg - dressed \" systems .",
    "the off - resonant optical coupling of ground state atoms to highly excited rydberg states [ 6 , 7 ] allows one to modify and control the shape and strength of effective two - body interactions .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that a small component of the rydberg state is admixed to the ground state of atoms , providing thereby an additional degree of manipulation of the interaction strength .",
    "the shape of the potential energy of the two many - electron atoms excited to a rydberg state depends very much on details of the electronic structure .",
    "the most common long - range behavior , however , is of a standard van der waals ( @xmath76 ) type with possible admixture of terms of other degrees , e.g. , a pure dipole interaction ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these additional contributions are responsible for the tails of the interaction potentials .",
    "the  dressing \" of two rydberg atoms with van der waals type of interaction results , see refs .",

    ", the inter - particle interaction reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the rescaled interaction strength and @xmath83 . in the present study ,",
    "we have used one- , two- and three - dimensional versions of inter - particle interactions of a similar shape @xmath84 of half - width @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "this degree of the inter - particle repulsion function corresponds to an `` intermidiate '' situation between the pure dipole - dipole and van der waals interactions .",
    "we have used it to demonstrate the generality of the observed physics , which holds for @xmath85 and @xmath86 as well .",
    "the strength @xmath2 of the inter - particle interaction depends on experimentally tunable parameters : @xmath87  a two - photon rabi frequency between the involved atomic levels , @xmath88  detunings of lasers with respect to the atomic transitions , and the external confinement @xmath33 .",
    "the  screening \" constant @xmath89 defines the critical distance , below which the interaction is constant , i.e. , originates to the blockade phenomenon [ 5 ] .",
    "this range depends on the detuning @xmath88 and on the pure spectroscopic @xmath90 coefficient governed by the electronic structure of the excited state , i.e. , it can be manipulated by a proper choice of an atomic rydberg level .",
    "what are the presently available / reachable experimental conditions for rydberg excitations ? in recent experiment , see ref .",
    "[ 8 ] , with @xmath91rb bose - einstein condensates , a few tens of rydberg atoms in a quasi-1d trap have been successfully detected .",
    "the reported blockade radii were between 5- while the radial dipole trap frequencies used were around , resulting in a radial length of order of 1- , i.e. , a ratio @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the  screening \" constant of the rb atoms .",
    "it means that the range of the interaction was larger than the the size of the trap in the transverse direction .",
    "the strength of the interaction of the dressed rydberg atoms is defined by the @xmath94 ratio and can be tuned between 0.1- , implying that in a trap the corresponding dimensionless interaction strength @xmath82 can be @xmath95 1 - 100 .",
    "so , formally , the lengths / ranges and interaction strength needed to observe the predicted multi - hump muti - fold fragmented states and their dynamics are already reachable with ultra - cold  dressed \" rydberg atoms .",
    "let us now demonstrate that ground state properties of the trapped bosonic system with a finite - range repulsive interaction can be controlled by varying either the strength of the inter - particle repulsion @xmath2 , the tightness / strength of harmonic confinement @xmath33 , or by changing the number @xmath34 of the trapped particles . for more details see ref .",

    "the time - dependent studies reported in the main text have equipped us with detailed time - dependent understanding of the above mentioned control functions .",
    "namely , the topology of a once prepared system can not be easily and smoothly changed by a simple , sudden quench of the repulsion .",
    "indeed , we have shown that attempts to bring an initially two - fold fragmented system to the super - fluid , one - hump regime via strong decrease of the interaction , or to a three - fold fragmented state via strong increase of the interaction have resulted in explosive dynamics .",
    "the systems with different number of humps have different topologies and live in different configurational ( fock ) spaces , implying that to bring one system to another one we have to `` transfer '' a macroscopic number of the particles from one fragment ( hump ) to the other fragments which is , clearly , a very non - trivial many - body task .",
    "furthermore , it is easier to realize the systems with a few humps and many particles per hump than the many - hump system with a few particles per hump . since the height of the induced barrier is proportional to the interaction strength and to the number of particles residing in the fragment , the humps with a larger number of particles are more stable with respect to exchange and loss of particles , i.e. , to the temperature .",

    "<S> let us digest the physics of the above observed dynamical regimes . in the non - violent evolutions </S>",
    "<S> , see e.g. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a , b ) for 1d and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) for 2d , the strong repulsion prevents an exchange of the particles between the sub - clouds , so they do not come to a proximity for a contact . </S>",
    "<S> the superposition of the induced time - dependent barriers and external trap results in effective potentials which are high enough to confine the sub - clouds even in the case when they are moving . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the non - violent dynamics of the trapped multi - hump , multi - fold fragmented repulsive systems appears when the manipulations exerted on the system are not strong enough to destroy or overcome the induced time - dependent barriers . </S>",
    "<S> so , the physics behind is an under - a - barrier dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> complimentary , the violent dynamics appears when the induced barriers are not high enough to keep the sub - clouds apart from each other . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](a ) for 2d , and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] for 3d , reduce the heights of the induced barriers , which are proportional to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - clouds start to leak out and eventually become delocalized over the entire trap . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath53 quench in 2d , depicted in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) , formally leads to an increase of the heights of the induced barriers , but , simultaneously , it pumps too much internal energy into the system . at this new value of the inter - particle interaction strength the ground state is three - fold fragmented and , hence , the shapes of the initial two - hump sub - clouds are no more optimal . </S>",
    "<S> it also implies that the energy per - particle of each sub - cloud is larger than the heights of the induced time - dependent barriers . during the violent evolutions </S>",
    "<S> the available energy is redistributed between the excited states which have multi - node structures and can be delocalized over the entire trap . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the density reveals the observed highly violent explosive behavior . </S>",
