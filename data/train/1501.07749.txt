    "the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) is responsible for the production of about half of the heavy element abundances beyond fe in the solar system , and of the heaviest elements like th and u. the remaining heavy element abundances are mostly made by the slow neutron capture process ( s - process , e.g. , @xcite ) . despite its relevance ,",
    "the true astrophysical origin of the r - process is still under debate . because of the larger uncertainties affecting the r - process nucleosynthesis predictions compared to the s - process in stars , the r - process isotopic contribution in the solar system has been originally identified by using the residual method , i.e. , by subtracting the s - process component from the solar isotopic distribution ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the r - process residual abundances have been shown to be consistent in first approximation with the abundance signatures in old r - process rich metal - poor stars ( at least for elements heavier than ba , see @xcite for details ) , carrying the signature of the r - process nucleosynthesis in the early galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , eu receives only a marginal contribution from the s - process ( the s - process explains only 6 per cent of the solar eu , while the remaining amount has an r - process origin , @xcite ) , and therefore it is often used as a tracer of the r - process nucleosynthesis in stellar spectroscopic observations .",
    "one possibility to test predictions from r - process nucleosynthesis is to include the r - process stellar yields in galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) simulations , and to compare the theoretical results with spectroscopic observations at different metallicities .",
    "eu is an ideal diagnostic for these studies .",
    "the purpose of this work is to illustrate the europium evolution throughout the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "we consider here the contribution from two sites ( and their frequency ) to the production of heavy r - process elements : neutron star merger ( nsm ) and  magneto - rotationally driven supernovae ",
    "( hereafter referred to as  jet - sne  ) . we will show that the combination of both sites is able to reproduce the observed europium abundance distribution of the stars of our galaxy .    neutron star - black hole ( ns - bh ) mergers might have a non - negligible contribution to the r - process inventory in the galaxy .",
    "however , their relevance as astrophysical source for the r - process is controversial , since this event has not yet been observed ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". these difficulties also result in an extreme divergence of the predicted galactic rate of such an event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noticed that a contribution from ns - bh mergers has been predicted as well ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we give an estimate of the possible effects caused by these events in section  [ conlusion and discussion ] .",
    "chemical evolution of galaxies has made strong advances since its early days .",
    "initially all approaches made use of the instantaneous recycling approximation in the sense , that the ejecta of stellar end stages were immediately utilized without delay after the initial star formation , assuming that the stellar evolution time scale is short in comparison to galactic evolution .",
    "if , in addition , the instantaneous mixing approximation was applied , i.e. , assuming that the ejecta were instantaneously mixed throughout the galaxy , the whole galaxy acts as a homogeneous box .",
    "neglecting this can explain radial gradients .",
    "further developments included infall of primordial matter into and outflow of enriched material out of the galaxy ( for a review of these early investigations see e.g. , @xcite ) . when relaxing the instantaneous recycling approximation , i.e. , taking into account that ( explosive ) stellar ejecta enter the interstellar medium ( ism ) delayed with respect to the birth of a star by the duration of its stellar evolution , detailed predictions for the evolution of element abundances can be made .",
    "based on nucleosynthesis predictions for stellar deaths , a number of detailed analyses have been performed , from light elements up to the fe - group ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such approaches have recently also been applied to understand the enrichment of heavy elements in the galaxy ( including r - process contributions ) as a function of time or metallicity [ fe / h ] ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    however , if still the instantaneous mixing approximation is applied , i.e.",
    ", such ejecta are instantaneously mixed with the global ism , no local inhomogeneities can be produced .",
    "the latter would relate to the fact that only limited amounts of the ism are polluted by / mixed with the ejecta of each event .",
    "this effect is of essential importance , especially at low metallicities , where portions of the ism are already polluted by stellar winds and supernovae , and others are not . in addition",
    ", different portions of the ism are polluted by different types of events , leading to a scatter at the same metallicity , which can in fact be utilized as a constraint for these different stellar ejecta .",
    "when , however , utilizing the instantaneous mixing approximation , this leads to a unique relation between galactic evolution time and metallicity [ fe / h ] , i.e. , any [ fe / h ] can be related to a specific time in the evolution of a galaxy ( while inhomogeneous mixing could experience similar [ fe / h ] values in different locations of the galaxy at different times ) .",
    "this is especially the case in the very early galactic evolution ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) , when locally only a few stars ( out of a whole initial mass function imf ) might have exploded and imprinted their stellar neighbourhood with their ejecta .",
    "thus , the application of chemical evolution models which utilize the instantaneous mixing approximation is questionable for the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "in addition , for each [ fe / h ] , due to the instantaneous mixing , only a mean value of [ x / fe ] ( x being the element of interest to follow in chemical evolution ) is obtained .",
    "inhomogeneous mixing , however , could produce larger ratios in strongly polluted areas and smaller values in still less polluted ones .",
    "this means that the scatter in [ x / fe ] at low metallicities , which might also be a helpful asset in pointing to the origin of element x , can not be reproduced or utilized with an homogeneous treatment . in case of rare events , which  on the other hand ",
    "produce large amounts of element x in each event , this would produce a large scatter , and ",
    "if observed  could be used as a very helpful constraint to identify the production site . for these reasons , specially for the origin of r - process elements like eu , we think that only inhomogeneous chemical evolution models should be utilized at low metallicities . the two type of rare events ( i ) jet - sne ( maybe up to 1% of all core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) ) and ( ii ) neutron star mergers , with a similar occurrence frequency of about 1% of all ccsne are considered here , while regular and more frequent core collapse supernovae might at most contribute to the lighter r - process elements .",
    "the binary merger rates are estimated by @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "the rate of jet - sne is related to the fact that about 1% of neutron stars are found with magnetic fields of the order @xmath5 gauss ( magnetars , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .    earlier inhomogeneous chem(odynam)ical evolution models for r - process elements like eu have been provided by travaglio et al .",
    "( 2001 , where the r - process yields were assumed to come from ccsn ) , @xcite and @xcite comparing neutron star mergers and core collapse supernovae , cescutti & chiappini ( 2014 , comparing nsm and jet - sne ) mennekens & vanbeveren ( with nsm and ns - bh mergers ) , and shen et al . and van de voort et al .",
    "( 2015 , only utilizing neutron star mergers ) .",
    "one of the main questions here is related to the problem of reproducing [ eu / fe ] at low(est ) metallicities .",
    "cescutti & chiappini ( 2014 ) have shown that this is possible with jet - sne .",
    "@xcite concluded that neutron star mergers can not reproduce observations at [ fe / h]@xmath4 , while @xcite and @xcite came to the opposite conclusion .",
    "the main difference between jet - sne and neutron star mergers is that in one case the immediate progenitors are massive stars and the first occurrence in chemical evolution is due to the death of massive stars . in the other case",
    "the progenitors are also massive stars , leading to two supernova explosions in a binary system , which  if not disrupted",
    " causes a binary neutron star system and a merger with a given delay time due to gravitational radiation losses .",
    "thus , one needs to consider two aspects : ( i ) the two supernova explosions and the pollution of the ism with their ejecta ( for the case of ns - bh mergers see the discussion in section  [ conlusion and discussion ] ) , and ( ii ) the delay time of the merger event after the formation of the binary neutron star system .",
    "especially aspect ( i ) can only be treated adequately with inhomogeneous evolution models , and there an additional factor is of major importance : with how much matter the supernova ejecta mix before the neutron star mergers eject their products into the same environment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ the model ] , we introduce the model used to compute the evolution of abundances . in section  [ results ] , we present the influence of the different r- and non - r - process sites on the evolution .",
    "additionally , we provide an overview why an inhomogeneous treatment of the evolution is important . in section  [ inhom ]",
    "we discuss the impact of inhomogeneities , causing and permitting a scatter of [ x / fe ] ratios at low metallicities . as a further test of the model",
    ", we discuss the fact why the large scatter of [ r / fe ] observed at low metallicities is strongly reduced for @xmath3-elements , and show how this constraints core collapse supernovae nucleosynthesis predictions , which are still not available in a self - consistent way . in section  [ conlusion and discussion ] ,",
    "our results are summarized and discussed .",
    "recent chemodynamical galactic evolution models , like e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , can model in a self - consistent way massive mergers of galactic subsystems ( causing effects like infall in simpler models ) , energy feedback from stellar explosions ( causing effects like outflows ) , radial migrations in disk galaxies , mixing and diffusion of matter / ism , and the initiation of star formation dependent on local conditions , resulting from the effects discussed above . in our present investigation we still utilize a more classical approach with a parametrized infall of primordial matter , and a schmidt law ( @xcite ) for star formation . therefore",
    ", we neglect large scale mixing effects , while we include the feedback from stellar explosions and the resulting mixing with the surrounding ism , according to a sedov - taylor blast wave . in this way",
    ", the model permits to keep track of the local inhomogeneities due to different ccsn ejecta .",
    "this approach allows to grasp the main features of the impact of the first stars / stellar deaths on the evolution of the heavy element enrichment .",
    "this approximation omits other mixing effects , e.g. , spiral arm mixing ( on time scales of the order of @xmath6 years ) .",
    "the main focus of this work is the investigation of the chemical evolution behaviour at low metallicities , where these effects should not have occured , yet , and are therefore left out in this first order approximation .",
    "we treat the galactic chemical evolution of europium ( eu ) , iron ( fe ) and @xmath3-elements ( e.g. , oxygen o ) , utilizing the established gce code  inhomogeneous chemical evolution  ( ice ) , created by @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the model can be found therein .    for the simulation",
    ", we set up a cube of @xmath7 within the galaxy which is cut in @xmath8 smaller cubes representing a @xmath9 sub cube each .",
    "the evolution is followed with time - steps of 1my .",
    "primordial matter is assumed to fall into the simulation volume , obeying the form @xmath10 which permits an initially rising and eventually exponentially declining infall rate .",
    "while @xmath11 and the total galaxy evolution time @xmath12 are fixed initially , the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be determined alternatively from @xmath15 ( the total infall mass integrated over time ) , defined by @xmath16 and the time of maximal infall @xmath17 , given by @xmath18    see @xcite for an extended discussion of the infall model and table  [ infall parameters ] for the applied parameters .    .main infall parameters .",

    ". dividing by the average stellar mass of a salpeter imf ( power @xmath21 ) provides the total number of stars per time step @xmath22 created in the overall volume of our simulation .",
    "2 .   individual cells in",
    "which stars are formed are selected randomly until @xmath22 is attained , but the probability is scaled with the density , which leads to the fact that patches of higher density , predominently close to supernova remnants , are chosen .",
    "the mass of a newly created star is chosen randomly in the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 , subject to the condition that the mass distribution of all stars follows a salpeter imf .",
    "consequently only cells which contain more than @xmath25 are selected in order to prevent a bias .",
    "4 .   the newly born star inherits the composition of the ism out of which it is formed .",
    "the age of each star is monitored , in order to determine the end of its lifetime , either to form a white dwarf or experience a supernova explosion ( see [ lms ] and [ hms ] ) .",
    "a fraction of all high mass stars ( @xmath26 ) , according to the probability ( @xmath27 ) , is chosen to undergo a magneto - rotationally driven supernova event ( see section  [ jet - sn ] ) .",
    "type ia supernova events are chosen from white dwarfs according to the discussion in [ snia ] . the treatment of neutron star mergers follows the description in [ nsm_model ] .",
    "the composition for the ejecta of all these events is chosen according to the discussion in [ nucleosynthesis sites ] .",
    "they will pollute the neighbouring ism with their nucleosynthesis products and sweep up the material in a chemically well mixed shell .",
    "we assume that an event pollutes typically @xmath28 of surrounding ism due to a sedov - taylor blast - wave of @xmath29erg ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the radius of a remnant depends strongly on the local density and the density of the surrounding cells .",
    "7 .   in the affected surrounding cells , stars are polluted by the matter of the previously exploded star and the event specific element yields .",
    "the details on the above procedure will be explained in the following .",
    "low and intermediate mass stars provide a fundamental contribution to the gce of e.g. , he , c , n , f , na and heavy s - process elements during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "for instance , most of the c and n in the solar system were made by agb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in their hydrostatic burning phase",
    ", these stars lock - up a part of the overall mass and return most of it to the ism in their agb phase by stellar winds .",
    "since the maximum radius of these winds is orders of magnitude smaller than the output range of supernova events ( e.g. , radius of crab remnant : 5.5 ly ( @xcite ) , while the diameter of the cat s eye nebula is only 0.2 ly ( @xcite ) ) , our simulation assumes that stellar winds influence the ism only in the local calculation cell .",
    "agb stars provide only a marginal s - process contribution to typical r - process elements like eu ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , for this work the s - process contribution to eu plays a negligible role and we are not considering it here .",
    "massive stars which exceed @xmath30 are considered to end their life in a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "ccsne produce most of the o and mg in the chemical inventory of the galaxy .",
    "they provide an important contribution to other @xmath3-elements ( s , ca , ti ) , to all intermediate - mass elements , the iron - group elements and to the s - process species up to the sr neutron - magic peak ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "associated to ccsne , different neutrino - driven nucleosynthesis components might be ejected and contribute to the gce ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , possibly including the r - process .",
    "we did not include regular ccsne as a major source of heavy r - process elements , as recent investigations indicate strongly that the early hopes for a high entropy neutrino wind with the right properties ( @xcite , @xcite ) did not survive advanced core collapse simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) which led to proton - rich environments in the innermost ejecta ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) , causing rather a so - called @xmath31-process ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . further investigations seem to underline this conclusion ( recently revisited by @xcite ) , although a more advanced  in medium ",
    "treatment of neutrons and protons in high density matter causes possible changes of the electron fraction ( @xmath32 ) of ejecta ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and might permit a weak r - process , including small fractions of eu .",
    "similar effects might be possible via neutrino oscillations ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we did not include regular ccsne in our gce simulations , although a weak r - process with small ( @xcite - like ) eu contributions could be responsible for a lower bound of [ eu / fe ] observations ( see fig .  [",
    "163 ] ) , explaining a non - detection of the lowest predicted [ eu / fe ] ratios .",
    "nucleosynthesis yields for hms are taken from @xcite or @xcite . assuming a typical explosion energy of @xmath29erg , the ejecta are mixed with the surrounding interstellar medium via the expansion of a sedov - taylor blast wave , which stops at a radius which contains about @xmath28 ( see section  [ iteration procedure ] for details on the iteration procedure ) .      when an ims is newly born in a binary system",
    ", there is a probability that it has a companion in the appropriate mass range leading finally to a snia , following a double- or single degenerate scenario .",
    "we follow the analytical suggestion of @xcite and reduce the numerous degeneracy parameters to one probability ( @xmath33 ) for a newly born ims to actually be born in a system fulfilling the prerequisites for a snia .",
    "once the star enters its red giant phase , we let the system perform a snia - type explosion and emit the event specific yields ( cf .",
    "@xcite , model cdd2 ) , which highly enriches the surrounding ism with iron . for this work",
    "we use the same snia yields for each metallicity , consistently with the @xcite calculations .",
    "we are aware that this choice is not optimal , since several snia yields including e.g. , mn and fe depend on the metallicity of the snia progenitor ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", this approximation does not have any impact on our analysis and our conclusions .",
    "if two newly born hms were created in a binary system , they may both undergo a ccsn individually .",
    "this could leave two gravitationally bound neutron stars (  ns  ) behind .",
    "such a system emits gravitational waves and the two ns spiral inwards towards their common center of mass with a coalescence time ( @xmath34 ) until they merge .",
    "the actual merging event is accompanied by an ejection of matter and ( r - process ) nucleosynthesis ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as all of these publications show the emergence of a strong r - process , in the mass region of eu they suffer partially from nuclear uncertainties related to fission fragment distributions ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . for our purposes we chose to utilize as total amount of r - process ejecta @xmath35 ( consistent with the @xmath36 ns collision in @xcite and @xcite ) , but distributed in solar r - process proportions , which leads for eu to a total amount of @xmath37 per merger .",
    "this value is relatively high in comparison to other investigations in the literature .",
    "observational constraints for the probability of a newly born star to undergo this procedure ( @xmath38 ) are provided by e.g. , @xcite who have found a nsm rate of @xmath39 , which corresponds to a @xmath40 .",
    "the coalescence time , @xmath38 and the event specific yields are important parameters for gce , and their influence on the gce are subject of this paper . concerning the coalescence time scale , it might be more realistic to use a distribution function ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) instead of a fixed value .",
    "we utilize this simplified procedure as a first order approach .      a fraction ( @xmath27 ) of high mass stars end their life as a  magneto - rotationally driven supernova  or magnetar , forming in the center a highly magnetized neutron star ( with fields of the order @xmath5gauss ) and ejecting r - process matter along the poles of the rotation axis ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "r - process simulations for such events were first undertaken in 3d by @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this work , we randomly choose newly born high mass stars to later form a jet - sn . at the end of their life time",
    ", they explode similar to a ccsn , however with different ejecta . based on @xcite ,",
    "we assume an amount of @xmath41 of europium ejected to the ism by such an event . in this work ,",
    "we study the influence of @xmath27 and the specific jet - sn yields on the gce .",
    "data for the observed stars to compare our simulation results with are taken from the saga ( stellar abundances for galactic archaeology ) database ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; in particular [ eu / fe ] abundance observations are mainly from e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "from the raw data , we excluded carbon enriched metal poor stars (  cemps  ) and stars with binary nature , since the surface abundances of such objects are expected to be affected by internal pollution from deeper layers or pollution from the binary companion .",
    "for a general understanding of the effects of jet - sne and nsm on gce , namely the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath34 and @xmath27 , we performed a number of simulations described in detail below .",
    "as a prerequisite , we studied the influence of both coalescence time and the probability of a binary system to become a nsm . in figure",
    "[ nfo ] , we present the evolution of [ eu / fe ] abundances when only nsm contribute to the enrichment . the results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "smaller coalescence time scale leads to an enrichment of europium at lower metallicities .",
    "larger coalescence time scale shifts this to higher metallicities .",
    "2 .   a higher nsm probability shifts towards a quantitatively higher enrichment combined with an appearence at lower metallicities .",
    "these effects can be explained in the following way .    1 .   when binary neutron star systems take longer to coalesce , the time between the ccsn of both stars and the nsm event is longer .",
    "the longer this delay time , also further nucleosynthesis events occur in the galaxy during this period , enriching the ism with metals .",
    "thus , when the nsm event finally takes place , surrounding stars have developed a higher [ fe / h ] abundance , shifting the system towards higher [ fe / h ] abundances , respectively .",
    "this implies an overall europium production shift towards higher metallicities .",
    "2 .   with more binary systems becoming nsm , the produced europium amount per time step is larger , since every event produces the same amount of r - process elements . this leads to a higher [ eu / fe ] abundance , compared to simulations with lower nsm probability . as the fraction of nsm systems is higher while the ccsn rate is constant , larger amounts of europium are produced , while the surrounding medium evolves regularly .",
    "this also leads to a higher abundance of europium at lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "these effects shift the [ eu / fe ] curve to higher values for the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "all these results are consistent with the earlier conclusions by @xcite , stating that it is extremely difficult to reproduce the observed [ eu / fe ] ratios at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath4 by nsm alone .",
    "a potential solution would be that the preceding supernovae which produced the two neutron stars of the merging system mix their ejecta with more extended amounts of the ism .",
    "we utilized the results following a sedov - taylor blast wave of @xmath29erg , which pollutes of the order @xmath28 of ism until the shock is stopped .",
    "@xcite assumed ( in their standard case ) the mixing with more than @xmath42 of ism ( @xcite utilized @xmath43 in a similar approach ) .",
    "this produces an environment with a substantially lower [ fe / h ] into which the nsm ejecta enter .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that in such a case the eu enrichment by nsm is setting in at lower metallicities .",
    "the higher resolution run shown in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite agrees with our results .",
    "thus , the major question is whether such a very much enlarged mixing with the ism by almost two orders of magnitude can be substantiated",
    ". we will discuss these aspect further in section  [ conlusion and discussion ]     years and the probability @xmath38 is set to @xmath44 .",
    "green dots illustrate the effect on the abundances if the coalescence time scale of nsm is shorter ( around @xmath19 years ) .",
    "blue dots show the abundance change if the probability of hms binaries to later merge in a nsm is increased to @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "subsection  [ nsm]).,width=317 ]      the contribution of jet - sne to the galactic eu abundance differs from that of nsm .",
    "since jet - sne explode directly from a massive star , they contribute much earlier to the chemical evolution than nsm .",
    "since the interstellar matter is distributed more inhomogeneously than in later evolution stages of the galaxy , high [ eu / fe ] abundances are possible in individual stars .",
    "this leads to a large spread in the abundances towards lower metallicities . considering jet - sne , the parameter with the highest impact on gce for such rare events , similar to nsm events but  earlier  in metallicity , is the probability of a massive star to actually become a jet - sn .",
    "a lower probability leads to a smaller overall [ eu / fe ] abundance , while a higher probability leads to larger abundances .",
    "however , we also recognize a larger spread in abundances in models with lower probability .",
    "this comes from the fact that the high yield of the event only sets an upper limit on the abundances .",
    "the rarer an event is , the more and the longer stars remain unpolluted .",
    "this results in a larger spectrum of abundances in stars and therefore in a larger spread in [ eu / fe ] ratios .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ jet - sn1 ] and fig .",
    "[ jet - sn2 ] that jet - sne might explain the abundances at low metallicities better than nsm .",
    "thus , while jet - sne alone could be an explanation for the lower metallicity observations , there is clear evidence of nsm events and therefore we have to examine the combination of both events .",

    "note that this model fails to reproduce the observed abundances at lower metallicities .",

    ", we can see how decreased event probability shifts the abundance curve down .",
    "we also remark an increase of the spread in abundances when the probability is lowered .",
    "the rarer a high yield event is , the larger is the spread in abundances.,width=317 ]      if both sites ( jet - sn and nsm ) are considered to contribute to the galactic europium abundances , their contributions overlap .",
    "therefore , parameters which lead to the observed [ eu / fe ] abundances , have to be searched for . as described in section  [ nsm ] , nsm contribute at a delayed stage to the gce and in our simulations are unable to reproduce europium abundances at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath4 , jet - sne , however , contribute europium early , but only in those regions where they occured , and cause a larger spread in the [ eu / fe ] values ( cf . section  [ jet - sn ] ) .",
    "we have to test whether it is possible to use the same parameters as in sections  [ nsm ] and [ jet - sn ] , since the full combination of both events could lead to an overproduction of elements .",
    "we can use the earlier parameter explorations to tune the simulated abundance pattern in order to match the observations . in the following ,",

    "we conclude that larger coalescence time scales and larger probabilities are necessary regarding nsm , and lower probability of jet - sne is necessary to flatten and lower the modelled abundance curve .",

    "such effects can also be seen in fig .  1 in @xcite for [ mg / fe ] , spreading by more than 1 dex , while observations seem to show a smaller spread up to @xmath68 dex .",

    "the production of heavy r - process matter in nsm is evident since many years ( see @xcite and many later investigations up to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our implementation of nsm in the inhomogeneous chemical evolution model  ice  can explain the bulk of eu ( r - process ) contributions in the galaxy for [ fe / h]@xmath70 , but have problems to explain the amount and the spread of [ eu / fe ] at lower metallicities .",
    "this is in agreement with the initial findings of @xcite .",
    "recent sph - based studies by @xcite make use of a mixing of the ejecta with @xmath71 , a further study by @xcite utilizes a mixing with @xmath72 up to @xmath73 . the mixing volume we utilize , based on the sedov - taylor blast wave approach ,",
    "would be related to a subgrid - resolution in these studies , but this treatment is essential for the outcome .",
    "mixing initially with a larger amount of matter causes smaller [ fe / h ] ratios into which the r - process material is injected .",
    "+ we have tested such differences in mixing volumes / masses also within our ice approach . fig .",
    "[ sweepup ] shows the results we obtain when changing from the sedov - taylor blast wave approach to a mixing mass of @xmath74 ( like in @xcite ) , and we can see that we essentially reproduce their results . on the other hand ,",
    "a higher resolution test in section 3.1 of @xcite is essentially in agreement with our results presented above .",
    "thus , these differences are not based on the differences in sophistication of the multi - d hydrodynamics approach , permitting to model energy feedback from supernovae , outflows and infall , they can rather be linked directly to the mixing volumes of supernova ejecta .",
    "this requires further studies in order to understand whether there exist physical processes ( on the timescale of the delay between the supernova explosions and the merger event ) which permit a mixing beyond the sedov - taylor blast wave approach .",
    "+   of ism .",
    "the dominant effect of this increased sweep up mass is to decrease the scatter of abundances and to shift the abundance curve towards lower metallicities.),width=317 ] 2 .",
    "the production of heavy r - process elements in a rare species of ccsne with fast rotation rates and high magnetic fields , causing ( fast ) jet ejection of neutron - rich matter along the poles has first been postulated by @xcite .",
    "this was followed up in rotationally symmetric 2d calculations @xcite , @xcite and the first 3d calculations by @xcite .",
    "these calculations still depend on unknown rotation velocities , and magnetic field configurations before collapse , however , they agree with the observations of magnetars and neutron stars with magnetic fields of the order @xmath5gauss which make up about @xmath75 of all observed neutron stars . further 3d calculations by @xcite and recent 2d calculations by @xcite , might indicate that not all events leading to such highly magnetized neutron stars are able to eject the heaviest r - process elements in solar proportions .",
    "thus , probably less than 1% of all ccsne end as jet - sne with a full r - process .",
    "+ when introducing jet - sne with ejecta as predicted by @xcite , they can fill in the missing eu at lower metallicities and reproduce the spread in [ eu / fe ] , in agreement with the recent findings of @xcite .",
    "we find that a fraction of @xmath76 of all ccsne which end up in this explosion channel provides the best fit .",
    "this would mean that not all but only a fraction of magnetar events which produce the highest magnetic field neutron stars are able to eject a main r - process composition of the heaviest elements , as discussed above .",
    "+ our conclusion is that both sites acting in combination provide the best scenario for understanding [ eu / fe ] observations throughout galactic history , with typical probabilities for nsm formations and ( merging ) delay times as well as probabilities for jet - sne . as a side effect",
    "we realized that present supernova nucleosynthesis yield predictions , based on induced explosions with a single explosion energy throughout the whole mass range of progenitor stars , bear a number of uncertainties .",
    "while apparently too large scatters of alpha / fe ratios can be obtained in inhomogeneous chemical evolution models , when utilizing existing nucleosynthesis predictions from artificial explosions with energies of 1 bethe , this might not be due to the chemical evolution model .",
    "such deficiencies can be cured by assuming larger mixing masses with the ism for supernovae explosions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or the introduction of an artificial floor of abundances based on imf - integrated yields of ccsne for metallicities at [ fe / h]@xmath77 , but it could in fact just be due the non - existence of self - consistent ccsn explosion models .",
    "we have shown that an explosion energy dependence on the compactness of the fe - core , related to the main sequence mass , could solve this problem as well by modifying the nucleosynthesis results . therefore , self - consistent core collapse calculations with explosion energies varying with progenitor mass and possibly other properties like rotation are highly needed .",
    "although we have obtained a good accordance with the observed eu abundances , the true origin of r - process elements might still require additional insights .",
    "the present investigation may be used to put constraints on the yields , as well as essential properties and occurrence frequencies of sites .",
    "+ there exist a number of open questions not addressed in the present paper , related ( a / b ) to production sites and ( c ) to the true chemical evolution of the galaxy",
    "as discussed in detail in section  [ hms ] , we did not include  regular  ccsne from massive stars as contributors to the main or strong r - process , producing the heaviest elements in the universe .",
    "however , as already mentioned in section  [ hms ] , there exists the chance for a weak r - process , producing even eu in a honda - style pattern in such events .",
    "this could provide the correct lower bound of [ eu / fe ] in fig .  [",
    "163 ] and would be consistent with the recent findings of @xcite .",
    "2 .   we did not include the effect of ns - bh mergers in the present paper .",
    "they would result in similar ejecta as ns - ns mergers per event ( @xcite ) , but their occurrance frequencies bear high uncertainties ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "provide a detailed account of their possible contribution and also discuss their contribution to global r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "one major difference with respect to our treatment of nsm in chemical evolution relates to the fact , that ( if the black hole formation is not causing a hypernova event but rather occurring without nucleosynthesis ejecta ) only one ccsn is polluting the ism with fe before the merger event , in comparison to two ccsne .",
    "this would lead to a smaller [ fe / h ] ratio in the ism which experiences the r - process injection , and just to an  earlier  appearance of high [ eu / fe ] ratios in galactic evolution .",
    "if we assume that bh formations are as frequent as supernova explosions , an upper limit of the effect would be that all ns - ns mergers are replaced by bh - ns mergers , moving the [ eu / fe ] features to lower metallicties by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "however , the lower main sequence mass limit for bh formation is probably of the order @xmath79 , and only a small fraction of core collapses end in black holes .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the inclusion of ns - bh mergers shifts the entries by more than @xmath80 in fig .",
    "this by itself would not be a solution in terms of making only compact ( i.e. ns - ns and ns - bh ) mergers responsible for the r - process at very low metallicities .",
    "there have been suggestions that the milky way in its present form resulted from merging subsystems with a different distribution of masses .",
    "such `` dwarf galaxies '' will experience different star formation rates .",
    "it is known that different star formation rates can shift the relation [ x / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "if the merging of such subsystems will be completed at the time when type ia supernovae start to be important , the relation [ x / fe]=f([fe / h ] ) will be uniform at and beyond [ fe / h]@xmath81 , but it can be blurred for low metallicities between the different systems , possibly leading also to a spread of the onset of high [ eu / fe ] ratios at low metallicities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the result depends on the treatment of outflows , should in principle be tested in inhomogeneous models , and also already be present in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but it surely requires further investigations to test fully the impact of nsm on the r - process production in the early galaxy .",
    "future studies will probably require a distribution of delay times for nsm events , a test of the possible contributions by bh - ns mergers , a better understanding of yields , and improvements in understanding mixing processes after supernovae explosions and during galactic evolution .",
    "testing the full set of element abundances from sne ia and ccsne as well as the two sources discussed above , in combination with extended observational data , will provide further clues to understanding the evolution of galaxies .",
