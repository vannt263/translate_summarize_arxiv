    "therefore , the finding of a powerlaw - like distribution of waiting times of solar flares has ambiguous interpretations .",
    "the situation in solar flare hard x - rays is very discordant : pearce et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and crosby ( 1994 ) report powerlaw distributions of waiting times with a very flat slope of @xmath11 , biesecker ( 1994 ) reports a near - exponential distribution after correcting for orbit effects , while wheatland et al .  ( 1998 ) finds a double - hump distribution with an overabundance of short waiting times ( @xmath12 s - 10 min ) compared with longer waiting times ( @xmath13 min ) , but is not able to reproduce the observations with a nonstationary poisson process . in this study",
    "we analyze flare catalogs from hxrbs / smm , batse / cgro and rhessi and are able to model all observed hard x - ray waiting time distributions with a unified model in terms of a nonstationary poisson process in the limit of high intermittency .",
    "we resolve also the discrepancy between exponential and powerlaw - like waiting time distributions , in terms of selected fitting ranges .",
    "the waiting time distribution @xmath14 for a _ poissonian random process _ can be approximated with an exponential distribution , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean event occurrence rate , with the probability @xmath17 normalized to unity .",
    "if the average event rate @xmath16 is time - independent , we call it a _ stationary poisson process_. if the average rate varies with time , the waiting time distribution reflects a superposition of multiple exponential distributions with different e - folding time scales , and may even ressemble a powerlaw - like distribution .",
    "the statistics of such _ inhomogeneous _ or _ nonstationary poisson processes _ can be characterized with _ bayesian statistics_.    a nonstationary poisson process may be subdivided into time intervals where the occurrence rate is constant , within the fluctuations expected from poisson statistics , so it consists of piecewise stationary processes , e.g. , @xmath18 where the occurrence rate @xmath19 is stationary during a time interval @xmath20 $ ] , but has different values in subsequent time intervals .",

    "if the rate is slowly varying , so that it can be subdivided into piecewise stationary poisson processes ( into bayesian blocks ) , then the distribution of waiting times will be @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fraction of events associated with a given rate @xmath19 in the ( piecewise ) time interval @xmath33 ( or bayesian block ) over which the constant rate @xmath19 is observed .",
    "if we make the transition from the summation over discrete time intervals @xmath33 ( eqs .  5 and 6 ) to a continuous integral function over the time interval @xmath34 $ ] , we obtain , @xmath35    when the occurrence rate @xmath22 is not a simple function , the integral eq .",

    "( 7 ) as an integral of the variable @xmath16 , @xmath40 where the denominator @xmath41 is the mean rate of flaring .",
    "let us make some examples . in fig .",
    "1 we show five cases : ( 1 ) a stationary poisson process with a constant rate @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) a two - step process with two different occurrence rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; ( 3 ) a nonstationary poisson process with piece - wise linearly increasing occurrence rates @xmath45 , varying like a triangular function for each cycle , ( 4 ) piece - wise exponential functions , and ( 5 ) piece - wise exponential function steepened by a reciprocal factor . for each case",
    "we show the time - dependent occurrence rate @xmath22 and the resulting probability distribution @xmath14 of events .",
    "we see that a stationary poisson process produces an exponential waiting time distribution , while nonstationary poisson processes with a discrete number of occurrence rates @xmath19 produce a superposition of exponential distributions , and continuous occurrence rate functions @xmath22 generate powerlaw - like waiting time distributions at the upper end .",
    "we can calculate the analytical functions for the waiting time distributions for these five cases .",
    "the first case is simply an exponential function as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) because of the constant rate @xmath46 , @xmath47    the second case follows from eq .",
    "( 5 ) and yields @xmath48    the third case can be integrated with eq .",
    "the time - dependent flare rate grows linearly with time to a maximum rate of @xmath49 over a time interval @xmath50 , with a mean rate of @xmath42 , @xmath51 defining a constant @xmath52 the integral of eq .  7 yields @xmath53 .",
    "the integral @xmath54 can be obtained from an integral table .",
    "the analytical function of the waiting time distribution for a linearly increasing occurrence rate is then @xmath55 \\ , \\ ] ] which is a flat distribution for small waiting times and approaches a powerlaw function with a slope of @xmath56 at large waiting times , i.e. , @xmath57 ( fig .  1 , third case ) .",
    "the distribution is the same for a single linear ramp or a cyclic triangular variation , because the total time spent at each rate @xmath58 $ ] is the same .",
    "the fourth case , which mimics the solar cycle , has an exponentially growing ( or decaying ) occurrence rate , i.e. , @xmath59 defined in the range of @xmath60 $ ] , and has a mean of @xmath42 .",
    "the waiting time distribution can therefore be written with eq .",
    "( 8) as @xmath61\\right ) }      d\\lambda \\ , \\ ] ] which corresponds to the integral @xmath62 using @xmath63 and thus has the solution @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 for very large waiting times @xmath66 it approaches the powerlaw limit @xmath67 ( see fig .  1 fourth panel ) .",
    "the fifth case has an exponentially growing occurrence rate , multiplied with a reciprocal factor , i.e. , @xmath68 and fulfills the normalization @xmath69 .",
    "the waiting time distribution can then be written with eq .",
    "( 8) as @xmath70\\right ) }      d\\lambda \\ , \\ ] ] which , with defining @xmath63 , corresponds to the integral @xmath71 and has the limit @xmath72 , yielding the solution @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 for very large waiting times @xmath66 it approaches the powerlaw limit @xmath75 ( see fig .",
    "1 bottom panel ) .",
    "thus we learn from the last four examples that most continuously changing occurrence rates produce powerlaw - like waiting time distributions with slopes of @xmath76 at large waiting times , despite of the intrinsic exponential distribution that is characteristic to stationary poisson processes .",
    "if the variability of the flare rate is gradual ( third and fourth case in fig .  1 ) , the powerlaw slope of the waiting time distribution is close to @xmath10 . however , if the variability of the flare rate shows spikes like @xmath77-functions ( fig .  1 , bottom ) , which is highly intermittent with short clusters of flares , the distribution of waiting times has a slope closer to @xmath78 .",
    "this phenomenon is also called clusterization and has analogs in earthquake statistics , where aftershocks appear in clusters after a main shock ( omori s law ) .",
    "thus the powerlaw slope of waiting times contains essential information whether the flare rate varies gradually or in form of intermittent clusters .",
    "we present an analysis of the waiting time distribution of solar flares observed in hard x - rays , using flare catalogs obtained from the _ ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) _ , the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , and the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) _ , and model also previously published data sets from smm ( pearce et al .",
    "1993 ) , granat ( crosby 1996 ) , and isee-3 ( wheatland 1998 ) .",
    "rhessi ( lin et al .  2002 ) was launched on february 5 , 2000 and still operates at the time of writing , for a continuous period of 8 years .",
    "the circular spacecraft orbit has a mean period of 96 min ( 1.6 hrs ) , a mean altitude of 600 km , and an inclination of @xmath79 with respect to the equator , so the observing mode is interrupted by gaps corresponding to the spacecraft night ( with a duration of about 35 percent of the orbit ) , as well as some other data gaps when flying through the _ south atlantic anomaly ( saa)_. these data gaps introduce some systematic clustering of waiting times around an orbital period ( @xmath80 hrs ) .",
    "we are using the official rhessi flare list ( which can be downloaded from the rhessi webpage _ http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessidatacenter/_ ) . we are using data from the first six years of the mission ( from february 12 , 2002 , to december 31 , 2007 ) , when a uniform threshold for flare detection was applied , while a lower threshold was applied after this period .",
    "we include all flare events that have a solar origin , in the sense that they could be imaged in the energy range of 12 to 25 kev .",
    "the complete event catalog ( sampled up to feb 1 , 2010 ) contains @xmath81 events , of which 12,379 have been confirmed to be solar .",
    "the number of confirmed solar flare events we are using from the first six years includes 11,594 events , which corresponds to a mean flare rate of @xmath82 events per day during 2002 - 2007 .",
    "a time series of the daily rhessi flare rate is shown in fig.2 ( top panel ) .",
    "the mean annual flare rate clearly drops systematically from 2002 to 2008 , but the daily fluctuations are larger than the slowly - varying mean trend .",
    "we calculate the waiting times simply from the time difference between two subsequent flare events , @xmath83 if we plot the waiting time distribution on a log - log scale ( fig .",
    "2 bottom right ) , we see that the waiting time distribution @xmath84 can approximately be fitted with a powerlaw function , i.e. , @xmath85 , with a powerlaw slope of @xmath3 . however , there is some clustering of events above one orbital period of @xmath86 hrs , as well as at the second to fourth harmonics of the orbital period ( fig .  1",
    ", bottom left ) , which are caused for several reasons .",
    "a first reason is that events that start at spacecraft night can not be detected until the spacecraft comes out of the night part of the orbit , causing some clustering after one full orbital period .",
    "a second reason is that large events that extend over more than one full orbital period are double - counted in each subsequent orbit .",
    "these instrumental biases have been modeled with monte - carlo simulations in previous waiting time studies ( e.g. , biesecker 1994 ) , but instead of correcting for these erroneous waiting times , we will just exclude the range of @xmath87 ( @xmath880.4 - 2.4 hrs ) in the fits of waiting time distributions .",
    "thus our first result is that the waiting time distribution of rhessi flares is approximately consistent with a powerlaw distribution in the time range of @xmath4 hrs , with a powerlaw slope of @xmath3 . for a nonstationary poisson process",
    "we expect powerlaw slopes in the range of @xmath89 ( fig .  1 ) , so the measured distribution is close to what the theory predicts for very intermittently varying flare rates ( fig .  1 , bottom ) .",
    "the high degree of intermittency is indeed clearly recognizable in the data ( fig .  2 ,",
    "top panel ) , where the short - term fluctuations are much faster than the long - term trend .",
    "one might subdivide the flare activity into two states , i.e. , _ `` quiescent '' _ and _ `` flare - active '' _ states , similar to the quiescent periods ( soft state ) and active periods ( hard state ) of pulses from accretion disk objects and black - hole candidates ( e.g. , cygnus x-1 ; mineshige et al .",
    "we indicate quiescent periods with waiting times @xmath90 hrs in fig .  2 ( top panel ) , where it can be seen that they occur in every month through all 8 years , but more frequently during the ( extended ) solar minimum ( 2006 - 2008 ) .",
    "thus , flare - active periods are very intermittent and not lasting contiguously over extended periods of time .",
    "the situation is also similar to earthquakes , where aftershocks appear clustered in time intervals after larger main shocks ( omori s law ) .    in a next step",
    "we investigate the effect of flux thresholds in the event definition on the distribution of waiting times , an issue that has been raised in previous studies ( e.g. , buchlin et al .",
    "2005 ; hamon et al .",
    "hamon et al .  (",
    "2002 ) finds for the olami - feder - christensen model ( olami et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is a cellular automaton model for systems with self - organized criticality , that event definitions without any threshold lead to stretched exponential waiting time distributions , while threshold - selected events produce an excess of longer waiting times .",
    "we investigate this problem simply by applying various flux thresholds to the rhessi flare catalog , e.g. , @xmath91 cts s@xmath92 , and by re - sampling the waiting times for events above these flux thresholds .",
    "the corresponding six waiting time distributions are shown in fig .  3 , which contain @xmath93 events detected without a threshold , and @xmath94 , 2038 , 781 , 271 , and 108 events for the thresholded subsets .",
    "the waiting time distributions clearly show an increasing excess of longer waiting times with progressively higher thresholds , which is expected due to the filtering out of shorter time intervals between flares with weaker fluxes below the threshold . based on the reduction in the number @xmath95 of events as a function of the flux threshold",
    ", we can make a prediction how the mean waiting time interval increases with increasing threshold , namely a reciprocal relationship , since the total duration @xmath50 of waiting times is constant , @xmath96 thus , from the number of events @xmath97 detected above a selected threshold we can predict the mean waiting time , @xmath98 using the full set of data with @xmath99 events and a mean waiting time of @xmath100 hrs ( fig .  3 , top left ) , we can predict the distributions and average waiting times for the thresholded subsets , based on their detected numbers @xmath97 using eq .  (",
    "21 ) : @xmath101 hrs .",
    "we fit our theoretical model of the waiting time distribution ( eq .  18 ) of a nonstationary poisson process and predict the distributions for the threshold datasets , using the scaling of the predicted average waiting times @xmath102 . the predicted distributions ( thick curves in fig .",
    "3 ) match the observed distributions of thresholded waiting times ( histograms with error bars in fig .",
    "3 ) quite accurately , and thus demonstrates how the waiting time distribution changes in a predictable way when flux thresholds are used in the event selection .    regarding the mean flare waiting time we have to distinguish between the theoretical model value @xmath103 and the mean detected interval @xmath104 .",
    "the theoretical value is calculated based on a complete distribution in the range of @xmath105 $ ] . for rhessi data",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath106 hrs . the observational value , which is about the total observing time span ( @xmath107 yrs ) multiplied with the spacecraft duty cycle , which is about @xmath108 for rhessi ( based on spacecraft nights with a length of 32 - 38 minutes ) , and divided by the number of observed events @xmath95 .",
    "so , we obtain a mean time interval of @xmath109 hrs .",
    "this value is about a factor of 4 longer than the theoretical value .",
    "this discrepancy results from either missing short waiting times predicted by the model ( since the observed distribution falls off at waiting times of @xmath110 hrs , i.e. , @xmath111 minute ) , or because the model overpredicts the maximum flare rate , and thus needs to be limited at the maximum flare rate or lower cutoff of waiting times .",
    "neverthelss , whatever lower cutoff of observed waiting times or what flux threshold is used , the theoretical value @xmath103 always indicates where the breaking point is in the waiting time distribution , between the powerlaw part and the rollover at short waiting times .",
    "the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) was launched on april 5 , 1991 , and de - orbited on june 4 , 2000 .",
    "the cgro spacecraft had an orbit with a period of @xmath112 hrs also , and thus is subject to similar data gaps as we discussed for rhessi , which causes a peak in the waiting time distribution around @xmath113 .",
    "we use the solar flare catalog from the _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) _ onboard cgro , which is accessible at the nasa / gsfc homepage _ http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov / batse/_. here we use a subset of the flare catalog obtained during the maximum of the solar cycle between april 19 , 1991 and november 12 , 1993 , containing 4113 events during a span of 1.75 years , yielding a mean event rate of @xmath114 events per day .",
    "batse has 8 detector modules , each one consisting of an uncollimated , shielded nai scintillation crystal with an area of 2025 @xmath115 , sensitive in the energy range of 25 kev-1.9 mev ( fishman et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the waiting time distribution obtained from batse / cgro is shown in fig .  4 ( middle right ) , which ranges from @xmath116 hrs up to @xmath117 hrs .",
    "we fit the same theoretical model of the waiting time distribution ( eq .  18 ) as for rhessi , and the powerlaw slope of @xmath118 fits equally well .",
    "since the obtained mean flare rate ( @xmath119 hrs ) is similar to rhessi ( @xmath106 hrs ) , the thresholds for selected flare events seems to be compatible .",
    "while rhessi observed during the solar cycles # 23 + 24 , cgro observed the previous cycles # 22 + 23 , and the solar maximum mission ( smm ) the previous ones # 21 + 22 , none of them overlapping with each other .",
    "smm was lauched on february 14 , 1980 and lasted until orbit decay on december 2 , 1989 .",
    "the _ hard x - ray burst spectrometer ( hxrbs ) _",
    "( orwig et al .  1980 ) is sensitive in the range of 20 - 260 kev and has a detector area of 71 @xmath120 .",
    "the orbit of smm had initially a height of 524 km and an inclination of @xmath121 , which causes similar data gaps as rhessi and cgro .",
    "hxrbs recorded a total of 12,772 flares above energies of @xmath122 kev during a life span of 9.8 years , so the average flare rate is @xmath123 flares per day , which is about half that of batse and slightly less than rhessi , which results as a combination of different instrument sensitivities , energy ranges , and flux thresholds .",
    "the waiting time distribution obtained from hxrbs / smm is shown in fig .  4 ( top right ) , which has a similar range of @xmath124 hrs as batse and rhessi .",
    "we fit the same waiting time distribution ( eq .",

    "also the orbital effects modify the observed distributions exactly the same way .",
    "thus we can interpret the distributions of waiting times for hxrbs in the same way as for batse and rhessi , in terms of a nonstationary poisson process with high intermittency .",

    "( 1993 ) , we obtain a similar fit but can not constrain the powerlaw slope for longer waiting times .",
    "a waiting time distribution of solar flares has earlier been published using watch / granat data ( crosby 1996 ) , obtained from the russian granat satellite , launched on december 1 , 1989 .",
    "granat has a highly eccentric orbit with a period of 96 hrs , a perigee of 2000 km , and an apogee of 200,000 km .",

    "( 1998 ) used a flux selection of @xmath145 photons @xmath120 s@xmath92 to obtain a near - complete sampling of bursts , which reduced the dataset to @xmath146 events .",
    "the resulting waiting time distribution extends over @xmath147 hrs and could not be fitted with a single nonstationary process , but rather exhibited an overabundance of short waiting times @xmath148 hrs ( wheatland et al .",
    "we reproduce the measured waiting time distribution of wheatland et al .",
    "( 1998 ; fig .  2 therein ) in fig .  4 ( bottom left panel ) and fit the combined waiting time distribution of a nonstationary poisson process ( eq .  18 ) and an exponential random distribution for the short waiting times ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "we find a satisfactory fit with the two waiting time constants @xmath149 hrs and @xmath150 hrs .",
    "the primary component of @xmath149 hrs ( @xmath151 min ) is much shorter than for any other dataset , which seems to correspond to a clustering of multiple hard x - ray bursts per flare , but is consistent with a stationary random process itself .",
    "the secondary component contains 45% of the hard x - ray bursts and has a waiting time scale of @xmath150 hrs .",
    "this component seems to correspond to the generic waiting time distribution we found for the other data , within a factor of two .",
    "since there are no waiting times longer than 20 hrs , the powerlaw section of the distribution is not well constrained for longer waiting times , but seems to be consistent with the other datasets .",
    "we revisited three previously published waiting time distributions of solar flares ( pearce et al .",
    "1993 ; crosby 1996 ; wheatland et al .",
    "1998 ) using data sets from hxrbs / smm , watch / granat , isee-3/ice , and analyzed three additional datasets from hxrbs / smm , batse / cgro , and rhessi . while the previously published studies arrive at three different interpretations and conclusions , we are able to reconcile all datasets and the apparent discrepancies with a unified waiting time distribution that corresponds to a nonstationary poisson process in the limit of high intermittency .",
    "our conclusions are the following :    1 .   waiting time statistics gathered over a relatively small range of waiting times , e.g. , @xmath152 decades as published by pearce et al .",
    "( 1993 ) or crosby ( 1996 ) , does not provide sufficient information to reveal the true functional form of the waiting time distribution",
    ". fits to such partial distributions were found to be consistent with a powerlaw function with a relatively flat slope of @xmath153 in the range of @xmath142 hrs , but this powerlaw slope does not extend to shorter or longer waiting times , and thus is not representative for the overall distribution of waiting times .",
    "2 .   waiting times sampled over a large range of @xmath154 decades all reveal a nonstationary waiting time distribution with a mean waiting time of @xmath155 hrs ( averaged from watch / granat , hxrbs / smm , batse / cgro , and rhessi ) and an approximate powerlaw slope of @xmath3 .",
    "this value of the powerlaw slope is consistent with a theoretical model of highly intermittently variations of the flare rate , in contrast to a more gradually changing flare rate that would produce a powerlaw slope of @xmath156 .",
    "waiting time studies with solar flares observed in soft x - rays ( goes ) reveal powerlaw slopes in the range from @xmath157 during the solar minimum to @xmath158 during the solar maximum ( wheatland and litvinenko 2002 ) , which would according to our model correspond to rather gradual variation of the flare rate with few quiescent periods during the solar maximum , but a high intermittency with long quiescent intervals during the solar minimum .",
    "the flare rate essentially rarely drops to a low background level during the solar maximum , so long waiting times are avoided and the frequency distribution is steeper due to the lack of long waiting times .",
    "3 .   for the dataset of isee-3/ice",
    "there is an overabundance of short waiting times with a mean of @xmath159 hrs ( 2 min ) , which seems to be associated with the detection of clusters of multiple hard x - ray bursts per flare ( wheatland et al .",
    "4 .   the threshold used in the detection of flare events modifies the observed waiting time distribution in a predictable way .",
    "if a first sample of @xmath160 flare events is detected with a low threshold and a second sample of @xmath161 events with a high threshold , the waiting time distributions of the form @xmath162 relate to each other with a reciprocal value for the mean waiting time , i.e. , @xmath163 .",
    "this relationship could be confirmed for the rhessi dataset for six different threshold levels .",
    "the main observational result of this study is that the waiting time distribution of solar flares is consistent with a nonstationary poisson process , with a highly fluctuating variability of the flare rate during brief active periods , separated by quiescent periods with much lower flaring variability .",
    "this behavior is similar to the quiescent periods ( soft state ) and active periods ( hard state ) of pulses from accretion disk objects and black - hole candidates ( mineshige et al .",
    "the fact that solar flares are consistent with a nonstationary poissonian process does not contradict interpretations in terms of self - organized criticality ( bak et al .",
    "1987 , 1988 ; lu and hamilton 1991 ; charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ) , except that the input rate or driver is intermittent .",
    "alternative interpretations , such as intermittent turbulence , have also been proposed to drive solar flares ( boffetta et al .",
    "1999 ; lepreti et al .",
    "2001 ) , but they have not demonstrated a theoretical model that correctly predicts the waiting time distribution over a range of five orders of magnitude , as observed here with five different spacecraft .    this work is partially supported by nasa contract nas5 - 98033 of the rhessi mission through university of california , berkeley ( subcontract sa2241 - 26308pg ) and nasa grant nnx08aj18 g .",
