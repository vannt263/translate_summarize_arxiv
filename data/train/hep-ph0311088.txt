    "the narrow 3872 mev state recently discovered by the belle collaboration @xcite , and subsequently confirmed by the cdfii collaboration @xcite , has generated a great deal of interest . the state contains a @xmath5 pair and was observed in the exclusive decay of @xmath6 .",
    "possible explanations of the state include a conventional charmonium state , hybrid state , and multi - quark molecular state @xcite .",
    "direct experimental search using @xmath7 annihilation by the bes collaboration in the bepc indicates that this state is unlikely to be a vector @xmath8 state @xcite .",
    "the 3872 state lies about 60 mev higher than the weighted average of the conventional @xmath9 charmonium state predicted by the cornell potential @xcite and the buchmller - tye potential @xcite .",
    "the identification of the 3872 state as @xmath10 would imply too large a splitting between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as the latter state has been identified with the 3770 state .",
    "furthermore , the 3872 state is seen in the @xmath12 transition to @xmath13 and only an upper bound on e1 transition to the @xmath14 state can be determined experimentally , whereas the @xmath10 state would have yielded a large partial e1 transition width , about 5 times greater than the width for the @xmath12 transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3872 state lies very near the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "the proximity of this state near the threshold and the difficulties with the @xmath10 description led the belle collaboration to suggest that the observed state may be a multi - quark ` molecular state ' studied in previous theoretical investigations @xcite",
    ".    we shall be interested in molecular states of the type @xmath0-@xmath1 where @xmath16 is a charm or bottom quark and @xmath17 is a @xmath18 or @xmath19 quark .",
    "we shall often use the simplified nomenclature of `` @xmath20 and @xmath21 '' or @xmath22 to denote mesons @xmath20 and @xmath23 or their charge conjugate @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "molecular states formed by @xmath26 and @xmath27 were predicted many years ago by t \" ornqvist @xcite who suggested that open heavy - quark pairs form deuteron - like meson - meson states , ` deusons ' , because of the strong pion exchange interaction . in the heavy meson sector ,",
    "t \" ornqvist estimated that one - pion exchange alone is strong enough to form deuteron - like composites of @xmath28 and @xmath29 bound by about 50 mev , and composites of @xmath4 and @xmath30 bound by pion exchange alone are expected near the threshold .",
    "manohar and weise have also studied another type of multi - quark systems , the @xmath31 hadronic states , in the limit where the quark mass @xmath32 of @xmath16 goes to infinity .",
    "they noted that there is a long - range binding due to the one - pion exchange between ground state @xmath33 mesons .",
    "they suggested that for two open bottom mesons , this long - range interaction may be sufficient to produce a weakly - bound two - meson state @xcite .",
    "ericson and karl discussed the physics of pion exchange and the role of tensor forces in forming such hadronic molecules @xcite .",
    "the pion - exchange model presents a reasonable description of the long - range attraction between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , as the state energy depends on the strength of the potential at short distances , the results of the pion - exchange model depends on how the long - range potential is regularized at short distances .",
    "the results may also be affected when exchanges of more mesons are included .    to describe the short - distance behavior",
    ", it is desirable to study multi - quark molecular states in a quark - based model .",
    "the phenomenological interaction between a quark and an antiquark in a single meson is reasonably well known @xcite .",
    "however , there are considerable differences and uncertainties in the description of the interaction between constituents in a baryon , as it has been given in terms of one - gluon exchange ( oge ) interactions involving color operators of the type @xmath34 @xcite , or alternatively in terms of a one - boson meson exchange ( obe ) interactions involving flavor operators of the type @xmath35 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath36 is the generator of the su(3)@xmath37 group for particle @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the generator of the su(2)@xmath40 group .",
    "the interquark interactions in the oge and obe models have very different color structures .    for the interaction between constituents of different mesons , lipkin and greenberg pointed out pathological problems involving the use of confining one - gluon exchange interactions in a quark - based model because they do not respect local color gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the underlying difficulty arises because the quark - based one - gluon exchange model represents a truncation of the basis states with the neglect of the dynamics of explicit gluon degrees of freedom . in spite of these defects ,",
    "the quark - based one - gluon exchange model with the interchange of quarks has been used successfully to study the interaction of mesons at short distances @xcite when the dynamics of the gluon degrees of freedom can be neglected .",
    "in a recent quark - based model study of molecular states using the one - gluon exchange model with constituent interchanges , swanson found that the one - gluon exchange interaction couples @xmath41 with @xmath42 , but the interaction is not attractive enough to lead to a bound molecular state @xcite .",
    "swanson then studied molecular states with the meson - based one - pion exchange model ( as in trnqvist @xcite ) and added the quark - based one - gluon exchange interaction with constituent - interchanges .",
    "the probability of the mixing of @xmath42 with @xmath41 depends on the one - pion exchange potential cut - off parameter @xmath43 , ranging from zero for the cut - off value of @xmath43 used by t \" ornqvist without the one - gluon exchange interaction @xcite to a maximum mixing of 17% at large values of @xmath43 .",
    "in such a treatment in which the interaction between quarks is superimposed on the one - pion exchange interaction between mesons , the position of the molecular state relative to the @xmath4 state and the degree of @xmath44 mixing depends on how the long - range pion exchange potential is regularized at short distances and the result may also be affected when exchanges of more mesons are included .",
    "we search for a description of the heavy - quark molecular states within a completely quark - based model .",
    "we note that the physical conditions appropriate for the molecular state of our interest have important effects on the interaction between the constituents in different mesons .",
    "the molecular state at the center of our attention has a binding energy of a few mev .",
    "for such a weakly - bound molecular state , the average separation @xmath45 between the heavy mesons is considerably greater than the average radius of heavy quark mesons @xmath46 ( see section iii for more detail ) , as was already recognized by close and page , voloshin , and braaten and kusunoki @xcite . at these large distances with @xmath47 ,",
    "the probability for the recombination of a quark of one meson with the antiquark of the other meson after a gluon exchange is highly suppressed as their quark - antiquark separation @xmath45 is much greater than their average natural meson radius @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 , far more likely after the exchange of a single gluon is the occurrence of the exchange of an additional gluon between quarks .",
    "this two - gluon emission leads to the color van der waals interaction proportional to the inverse - power of @xmath45 , as shown by applequist @xmath48 , peskin @xmath48 , bhanot @xmath48 , lipkin , greenberg , and many other authors @xcite .",
    "the color van der waals interaction can be equivalently represented in terms of effective charges of quarks and antiquarks in a qed - type interaction .",
    "there is however no experimental evidence for the color van der waals interaction of the inverse - power type between separated hadrons .",
    "as pointed out by lipkin and greenberg @xcite , it is necessary to include additional dynamics of gluons in such a quark - based model .",
    "accordingly , due to the breaking of the gluonic string at large distance , the color van der waals interaction should be screened by introducing a screening mass @xmath49 , which will modify the inverse - power color van der waals interaction at large distances .",
    "appropriate for the peculiar physical conditions of weakly bound molecular states , the concepts of effective charges and the screening mass are incorporated into the effective interquark potential which is subsequently used to explore meson - meson molecular states .",
    "nucleus - nucleus molecular states have been observed previously in the collision of light nuclei near the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "effective nucleon - nucleon interactions have been successfully applied to obtain the potential between two nuclei to study their reactions @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", effective interquark potentials can be used to obtain the potential between mesons . just as with the nucleus - nucleus potential ,",
    "the meson - meson potential can be evaluated as a sum of a direct potential and a polarization potential .",
    "the direct potential arises from the interaction of a constituent of one meson with a constituent of another meson , and the polarization potential arises when one meson polarizes the other meson in its vicinity .",
    "using gaussian wave functions for the mesons , the direct potential and the polarization potential can be obtained analytically .",
    "the knowledge of the potential between the mesons then allows one to determine the eigenstate of the four - quark system .",
    "using the effective interaction , we find many weakly - bound molecular states in @xmath50-@xmath51 systems with charm and bottom quarks , including a weakly - bound @xmath52 state near the threshold which may be qualitatively identified as the 3872 state .",
    "for the bottom meson @xmath50-@xmath51 pairs , there are weakly - bound 2s states near the threshold , in addition to 1s states with binding energies of about 150 mev .",
    "our exploratory study using effective charges and effective interactions in a non - relativistic quark model differs from those of the pion - exchange models and the multi - quark models with explicit single - gluon or single - boson exchanges .",
    "the results of molecular states obtained from different models can naturally be different .",
    "a careful comparison of these different results with experimental data will be useful to determine the importance of various mechanisms that are present in generating the molecular states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we start with the four - quark hamiltonian and partition the hamiltonian into an unperturbed part of two mesons and a residue interaction .",
