    "the korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent potential approximation ( kkr - cpa ) @xcite represents an extremely successful one - electron theory capable of describing the properties of many compositionally disordered alloy systems .",
    "in particular , in combination with density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and the korringa - kohn - rostoker method of band theory @xcite , it provides a fully first - principles description of such systems .",
    "a long history of successful applications @xcite attests to the utility and accuracy to which the method is capable .    of particular relevance to our discussion here",
    ", the kkr - cpa has been used to calculate the transport properties of such alloys . historically , the early work concerning this topic involved the use of a boltzmann equation @xcite , and although these works demonstrated remarkable agreement with experiment , they did suffer from two notable defects : namely , the requirement that well - defined energy bands exist within the alloy , and the neglect of vertex , or `` scattering - in '' , terms .",
    "the former defect limits the application of such a theory to weak - scattering alloys only , while the latter could be expected to lead to significant error in systems such as those where appreciable s - p or s - d scattering manifests itself .",
    "velicky @xcite developed a cpa theory for transport using the kubo - greenwood @xcite formalism as his starting point , which was applied to a two - level tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "although capable of yielding vertex corrections , this approach suffered from difficulties when applied to realistic systems .",
    "for example , the necessity of assuming that the wavefunctions are identical on all lattice sites , irrespective of the occupying atomic species . the seminal work of butler @xcite , resolved these issues , as he developed a kkr - cpa theory based upon the kubo - greenwood linear response formalism @xcite . as a multiple - scattering based approach , this did not require the existence of well - defined energy bands , and further , butler demonstrated how the vertex corrections arose quite naturally within his formalism . although the formal developments of this work followed velicky s quite closely , the use of a realistic single - electron muffin - tin hamiltonian allowed connection with first - principles methods to be made .",
    "the method has been applied with success to a range of alloy systems @xcite and it has also been successfully extended to the relativistic regime @xcite .    of course , all of these calculations suffer from the main drawback of the cpa ; namely that as a single - site mean - field theory , it is incapable of incorporating the effects of local - environment fluctuations in the alloy crystal potential .",
    "the cpa therefore explicitly ignores the effects of such short - range order ( sro ) effects upon the physics of disordered alloys . as discussed by gonis @xcite",
    ", these statistical fluctuations can be important .",
    "whilst in general the presence of sro is likely to diminish the resistivity there are examples , the so - called `` komplex '' k - state alloys @xcite , where the onset of sro is accompanied by an increase in the alloy residual resistivity .",
    "recently there have been some successful attempts at calculating the effects of sro upon the electronic structure of disordered alloys and they provide the means to study transport properties .",
    "mookerjee and prasad @xcite , using a tb - lmto method @xcite in conjunction with an augmented space formalism @xcite and real space recursion method @xcite described sro effects on alloy electronic densities of states and related quantities whilst saha",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite have obtained spectral functions within the same framework .",
    "recently tarafder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a formalism for the optical conductivity and reflectivity from the same basis and used it to study copper - zinc alloys .",
    "to date however it has not been possible to incorporate this technique fully within electronic density functional theory . the recent work of rowlands _ et al _ @xcite , along with biava _",
    "@xcite concern a development which is not restricted in this way .",
    "references   formulate and illustrate a successful method for incorporating the effects of sro within the framework of kkr - cpa theory , whilst implementation for realistic systems is described in references .",
    "the method can be readily combined with density functional theory to provide a first principles description of disordered alloys as demonstrated in reference .",
    "this nonlocal cpa ( nlcpa ) theory is based upon reciprocal space coarse - graining ideas introduced by jarrell and krishnamurthy @xcite originating from the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite .",
    "the kkr - nlcpa @xcite introduces an effective ( translationally invariant ) disorder term @xmath2 which represents an effective propagator that accounts for all nonlocal scattering correlations on the electronic propagation due to disorder configurations and modifies the structure constants accordingly . by coarse - graining reciprocal space ,",
    "one naturally introduces real space periodically repeating clusters . as such",
    ", the nlcpa maps an effective lattice problem to that of an impurity cluster embedded in a self - consistently determined effective medium , and thus yields a cluster generalisation of the kkr - cpa that includes non - local correlations up to the range of the cluster size .",
    "unlike other cluster approaches , such as the molecular cpa ( mcpa ) @xcite it is fully translationally invariant , that is , the effective medium has the site - to - site translational invariance of the underlying lattice .",
    "it is also computationally tractable , largely on account of the reciprocal space coarse - graining procedure employed .",
    "thus far , the nlcpa has been employed to investigate the effects of sro upon the electronic structure of a range of realistic systems , using both the muffin - tin hamiltonian @xcite , and the tight - binding approach @xcite .",
    "given its ability to address such issues successfully and its proven incorporation into an electronic density functional theory  @xcite ( dft ) for disordered systems with sro it makes sense then to extend it to the calculation of transport properties .",
    "to this end , by invoking time dependent dft  @xcite within the adiabatic approximation , in this paper we present a formalism for the determination of the residual resistivity in the kkr - nlcpa , and explicitly demonstrate the efficacy of the method through application to several realistic alloy systems .",
    "our theoretical formalism is a careful generalisation of that of butler @xcite and where appropriate we omit the steps in the derivation which can be straightforwardly obtained from this paper .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : the next section gives a short overview of the conductivity tensor and then the transport coefficients available from the kubo - greenwood formalism .",
    "this is followed by a section containing the salient points of the kkr - nlcpa formalism including its use in implementing the density functional theory .",
    "we then develop our theory for the conductivity of disordered systems with short - range order which includes the treatment of ` vertex corrections ' .",
    "the implementation strategy is outlined before calculations for the effects of sro on the resistivity of both b.c.c . @xmath1 and f.c.c .",
    "@xmath0 are presented .",
    "the kubo - greenwood @xcite linear response formalism states that , for disordered system , the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor has coefficients @xmath3 which can be determined from the evaluation of an expression of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a single - particle green s function , which is dependent upon the details of the effective one - electron potential . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are operators , and the angled brackets denote a configuration average over the distribution of the potentials .    to determine the d.c .",

    "the potentials @xmath28 vary from site to site ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 is a configuration label .    within the multiple - scattering theory , the single - particle green s function for a given configuration @xmath30 can be written as  @xcite    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the scattering path operator ( spo ) describing propagation between sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 in configuration @xmath30 , @xmath35 is the regular solution to the schrdinger / dirac equation in the cell surrounding the atom @xmath33 , and @xmath36 represents the irregular solution within the same cell ( note that there should be no confusion with the current matrix elements here ) .",

    "we now need to consider how to carry out the averaging over configurations implicit in eq.([tilde sigma ] ) .",
    "butler  @xcite showed in detail how to use the cpa to accomplish this .",
    "the single site nature of this effective medium theory means , however , that the potentials on the different lattices could only be treated as statistically independent .",

    "the particular example is to the d.c . conductivity .",
    "from the above it is clear that the kkr - nlcpa should enable an analytical configurational average of the conductivity to be carried out . to do so , some care needs to be exercised",
    "there are two distinct cases that we must consider in eq.([tilde sigma ] ) : ( i ) where the two sites under consideration , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , lie within the same nlcpa cluster , and ( ii ) when they lie in two different clusters , in which case the occupancies of the sites will be statistically independent , as the two distinct clusters will be statistically independent . this is a natural generalisation of butler s work @xcite , where he distinguishes between the two cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "hereon we use lower case letters to denote general sites in the lattice,@xmath77 ; upper case @xmath3 denotes tiles containing the clusters ; and upper case letters , with the exception of @xmath3 , denote sites within clusters .",

    "note that in writing these equations , we have utilised the translational invariance of the averaged system to remove the second sum appearing in eq.([tilde sigma ] ) .",

    "the single site quantity @xmath91 is set up depending on what kind of element occupies site @xmath63 and the one - electron potential @xmath74 that is dependent on the configuration @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , for the inter - cluster contributions to the conductivity , we can introduce the following    @xmath92    and @xmath93    where the notation is similar to before but",

    "again this is the direct generalisation of butler s approach  @xcite .",
    "we can write @xmath96 where the effective medium path spo is denoted @xmath97 as before and @xmath98 is the total scattering matrix relevant to the specific configuration .",

    "the good agreement between our nlcpa results and those from the well established cpa method for these alloys where no short - range order is present is a very satisfactory first test of the new formalism .",

    "it is also found that cold work causes little change to the resistivity suggesting that additional defects such as dislocations may already be present affecting the measurements .",
    "this may indicate the origin of our underestimate of the resistivity shown in figure 1 and figure 3 .",
    "short - range ordering and clustering dramatically affect the transport properties of many alloys . indeed resistivity measurements , which can be made easily and rapidly , provide a good way to monitor microstructural changes that occur in materials processing . in this paper",
    "we have described a way to make quantitative calculations of the resistivity of disordered systems which possess short - range order or clustering .",
    "the ab - initio theory starts from the density functional theory for these systems devised recently by rowlands et al .",
    "@xcite using the scf - kkr - nlcpa electronic structure method . our first calculations for @xmath197 and",
    "@xmath171 show the expected decrease of resistivity when short - range order is imposed whereas short - ranged clustering produces an increase .",
    "for the randomly disordered alloys the results are very similar to those that have been produced from established kkr - cpa resistivity calculations based on butler et al .",
    "work  @xcite .",
    "these first calculations have not included the effects of the short range order on the self - consistent charge densities and potentials that are available from the scf - kkr - nlcpa method .",
    "so far also short - range clustering and ordering effects over only the shortest nearest atomic neighbor range have been included .",
    "the computational development work is in progress to remove these current practical limitations .",
    "the counterintuitive behavior of the resistivities of the k - state alloys such as @xmath198,@xmath199 and @xmath200 will be ideal next systems to study .",
