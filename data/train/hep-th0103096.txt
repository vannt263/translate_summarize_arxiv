    "current - current interactions in two dimensions arise in many important physical systems , for example in non - fermi liquids , kosterlitz - thouless transitions , and disordered dirac fermions . for the generally non - integrable anisotropic cases ,",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) to low orders in perturbation theory has been one of the main tools for understanding these theories .",
    "recently , an all - orders function was proposed@xcite .",
    "some difficulties were encountered in understanding completely the consequences of these functions , due mainly to the existence of poles@xcite . in this paper",
    "we resolve some of these difficulties by using the duality pointed out in @xcite combined with some added topology in the space of couplings .",
    "we focus only on the anisotropic @xmath2 case .",
    "the @xmath3eta functions were originally computed by using the current - algebra ward identities to isolate the @xmath4 divergences at each order and summing the perturbative series .",
    "these series converge in a neighborhood of the origin which we identify as the perturbative domain .",
    "the functions turn out to be rational functions of the couplings and possess pole singularities at the boundary of this perturbative domain .",
    "we extend the functions away from this domain by analytical continuation .",
    "although simple , this ansatz is a hypothesis which may hide some dynamical effects , for example the possibility that degrees of freedom become relevant at the singularities . assuming that the proposed functions capture all perturbative contributions , the analytical continuation prescription provides a non - perturbative definition of them .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to check the consistency of the proposed functions upon analytical continuation and to decipher the consequences .",
    "it is useful to recall a few properties of the renormalization group transformations we expect , and to discuss pathologies that may be encountered .",
    "rg transformations , defined for example in the wilsonian scheme by successive integrations of the fast modes , induce a map on the space of effective actions . in this space , of a priori huge dimension , the rg transformations may be extended to arbitrarily large scales .",
    "the space of effective actions contains many irrelevant directions , corresponding to what are called stable manifolds , which are washed out in the continuum limit .",
    "the remaining directions , hopefully finite in number , label the continuous field theories if they exist . for renormalizable theories",
    "the rg transformations may be projected onto this parameter space .",
    "the renormalized coupling constants may then be viewed as the values of these parameters at the renormalization length scale . for renormalizable theories ,",
    "this then defines rg flows which may be extended to arbitrarily large or small scales as they simply correspond to space dilatations in the continuous field theories",
    ".    in perturbation theory one computes functions in some domains which may not cover all of phase space .",
    "the sizes of these domains , as well as the analytical properties of the functions , depend on renormalization prescriptions , i.e. on choices of coordinates . as a consequence",
    ", some rg trajectories can not be extended from perturbative domains to arbitrarily large scales .",
    "for example , one of the perturbative coordinates may blow up after a finite scale transformation .",
    "this signals that either some relevant degrees of freedom or some non - perturbative effects have been missed , or that the perturbative domains have to be extended .",
    "thus , as a rule we shall look for extensions of the perturbative phase spaces such that all rg trajectories can be followed up to infinitely large scales . in this situation",
    "we may call the rg phase space complete in analogy with general relativity where one looks for geodesically complete manifolds . similarly ,",
    "if the rg flows defined in this way can not be extended to small scales , but break at some ultraviolet cut - off , this may indicate the absence of a non - perturbatively defined renormalizable continuous theory .",
    "the models we consider are perturbations of the @xmath5 wzw models , the latter being conformal field theories with @xmath2 affine symmetry @xcite .",
    "let us normalize the @xmath2 level @xmath6 current algebra as follows [ 2.1 ] j_3(z ) j_3(0 ) ~ ,   j_3(z ) j^(0 ) ~ j^(0 ) ,   j^+ ( z ) j^-(0 ) ~ + j_3(0 ) and similarly for @xmath7 , and consider the anisotropic left - right current - current perturbation : [ 2.2 ] s = s_su(2)_k + @xmath8 the functions proposed in @xcite are [ 2.3 ] _",
    "g_1 & = & + _ g_2 & = & the @xmath2 invariant isotropic lines correspond to @xmath9 , and also to @xmath10 due to the @xmath2 automorphism @xmath11 which can be performed on the left - moving currents only sending @xmath12 .    by rescaling the currents @xmath13 in the isotropic case one",
    "easily sees that [ scaling ] _",
    "g = f(c_adj / k , kg ) where @xmath14 is the quadratic casimir in the adjoint representation , and @xmath15 is a function of the combinations @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath4 divergences that contribute to the function found in @xcite are linear in @xmath17 to any order in perturbation theory , which explains the simple @xmath6 dependence in ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "the manner in which @xmath4 divergences were isolated in @xcite led to no corrections which are higher powers of @xmath17 , and thus corrections to higher powers of @xmath18 , however the argument given does not constitute a proof that there are no such corrections .",
    "the work @xcite also did not deal with potential infra - red divergences . in this work",
    "we do not address these issues but simply assume the above function is correct and see if it can be made sense of .    in @xcite various regimes of behavior of the rg flows",
    "were identified .",
    "the main difficulty encountered in interpreting these flows was due to the fact that in some regimes after a finite scale transformation one flows to the poles and one can not extend the flows reliably beyond the poles numerically .",
    "another difficulty encountered in @xcite is that for some rg trajectories one of the coupling constants @xmath19 blows up after a finite scale transformation . in this paper",
    "we propose a resolution of this difficulty based on a strong - weak coupling duality of the function and some added topology of the space of couplings .",
    "consider the isotropic function for @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 ) with a double pole at @xmath22 : [ 2.4 ] _",
    "g = it exhibits a duality@xcite .",
    "define a dual coupling @xmath23 and let @xmath24 , then [ 2.6 ] ^ * ( g^ * ) = -(g g^ * ) suppose the flow starts at @xmath25 toward the pole . then at some scale @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the self - dual coupling .",
    "the duality of the function implies that a coupling @xmath29 at a scale @xmath30 flows to @xmath31 at a scale @xmath32 .",
    "thus the ultraviolet and infrared values of @xmath29 are simply related by duality .",
    "this can be seen from the analytical solution : [ 2.7 ] g - g^ * + 8 ( g / g_0 ) = 16 ( r / r_0 )    the anisotropic function also exhibits the duality ( [ 2.6 ] ) with [ 2.8 ] g_1^ * = ,   g_2^ * = if @xmath33 is a solution of the rg equations , so is @xmath34 for any @xmath26 . to simplify the notation , unless explicitly stated we rescale @xmath19 to absorb the @xmath6 dependence .",
    "the precise shape of the rg trajectories can be determined by using the rg invariant [ q ] q = it is simple to show [ qb ] _",
    "g q = 0 in consistency with the duality of the functions , one finds that @xmath35 is self - dual , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "eq.([q ] ) may be inverted to express @xmath37 as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "this gives the equations for the rg trajectories .",
    "the @xmath3eta function for @xmath38 may be written as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath35 only : @xmath39 the remaining pole at @xmath40 reflects the instability of the theory at that value of @xmath38 ; see its bosonized form ( [ 3.2 ] ) in the following section .",
    "the zeroes of @xmath41 are then found to be either on the @xmath38-axis with @xmath42 or at infinity @xmath43 .",
    "we propose to use the duality ( [ 2.8 ] ) to extend the flows through the poles .",
    "namely , if at a scale @xmath30 the couplings are @xmath33 , and the flow reaches the pole at a scale @xmath26 , then at the scale @xmath32 the couplings are given by @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure for example allows us to make sense of all trajectories in the shaded domains in figure 1 .",
    "the beta functions ( [ 2.3 ] ) are ill - defined at the self - dual points and as a consequence there are many trajectories going through these points .",
    "to resolve this paradox one has to locally change the description of the phase space .",
    "namely , points of the phase space will be described by coordinates @xmath45 with the identification ( [ q ] ) . this is a redundant description away from the self - dual points but not in the neighborhood of these points where it amounts to choosing for example @xmath46 as coordinates .",
    "this procedure , which is related to the mathematical construction known as local blowing up , changes slightly the topology of the phase space .",
    "it turns out one additional ingredient is needed for a global interpretation of the phase diagram .",
    "consider the region @xmath47 .",
    "using @xmath35 , one sees that here one is attracted to @xmath48 with @xmath49 . using duality arguments , it is easy to convince oneself that these trajectories reach @xmath50 in a finite rg time @xmath51 . without further information",
    "one can not extend the rg flows to arbitrarily large scales on the two dimensional plane with coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "since these trajectories are not flowing to a self - dual point , one can not use duality to extend the flows .",
    "however at @xmath53 , the function satisfies [ 2.9 ] ( g_1 , g_2 ) = ( g_1 , -g_2 )   when     scale transformation , one can consistently continue the flow at @xmath54 .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "thus we propose to identify the points @xmath57 which endows the coupling constant space with the topology of a cylinder .",
    "alternatively , instead of identifying the two infinities @xmath58 , one can view the procedure as gluing multiple patches of the coupling constant space together at @xmath57 , with ( [ 2.9 ] ) as a consistent gluing condition .",
    "the @xmath59 of one patch is identified with @xmath60 of the next patch . in this alternative construction the phase space",
    "will also acquire a non - trivial topology .    with the above hypotheses all rg flows can be extended to arbitrarily large or small length scales .",
    "all flows either begin on the @xmath38 axis and terminate at @xmath43 , or vice versa .",
    "since both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are simple zeroes of the functions , it takes an infinite rg time for the trajectories to reach these loci .",
    "consider the flows that originate from @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "they are attracted to the self - dual point @xmath63 , and then by duality end up at @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , the flows that originate from @xmath42 , @xmath66 end up at @xmath64 , @xmath67 . the flows that end up on the @xmath38 axis with @xmath68 originate from @xmath43 , @xmath69 by duality around the self - dual point @xmath70 .",
    "consider now the flows that originate from @xmath61 , @xmath71 .",
    "after a finite rg time @xmath51 , they are attracted to @xmath56 with @xmath49 .",
    "these flows then continue from @xmath54 of the next patch to the self - dual point @xmath72 and end up at @xmath43 , @xmath73 . again , since the flow went through a self - dual point , the couplings in the uv and ir are related by duality .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure 1 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the phase diagram is the reflection of the figure about the @xmath75 axis since @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly one phase exhibits roaming or cyclic rg trajectories .",
    "namely , flows that begin in a patch at @xmath78 , @xmath79 , flow through the poles at @xmath72 , then through the poles at @xmath80 , then off to @xmath50 , @xmath81 where they start over again at @xmath54 in the next patch .",
    "it takes a finite rg time to go from @xmath82 to @xmath83 following these trajectories .",
    "with the points @xmath50 and @xmath82 identified , these trajectories are cyclic , but in the alternative construction of the phase space by gluing multiple patches , these trajectories explore all patches .",
    "note that these flows pass by the perturbative domain , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , in which the perturbative expansions of the functions converge .",
    "if one assumes that field theories with initial couplings in the perturbative domain exist , one is naturally lead to include these rg trajectories into the phase space .    in the perturbative domain",
    "@xmath86 one observes flows toward the @xmath2 invariant isotropic line , but this line is unstable beyond the pole and the above duality arguments indicate that the @xmath2 symmetry does not continue to be restored at strong coupling .",
    "the phases above or below the isotropic line have then very different large scale asymptotics . as we describe in the next section , if the flows continued along the isotropic line , this would be inconsistent with the believed existence of a sine - gordon phase .",
    "these issues were recently addressed at one loop in @xcite .",
    "in this section we interpret the rg flows in a bosonized description .",
    "when @xmath21 , the current algebra can be bosonized as [ 3.1 ] j^= @xmath87 ,   j_3 = _ z where @xmath88 is the @xmath89-dependent part of a free massless scalar field @xmath90 .",
    "viewing the @xmath38 coupling as a perturbation of the kinetic term and rescaling the field @xmath91 one obtains the sine - gordon ( sg ) action [ 3.2 ] s = d^2 x @xmath92 where @xmath93 is to be determined . is related the conventional sine - gordon coupling @xmath3 by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 corresponds to the free - fermion point and @xmath96 is the kosterlitz - thouless point . ]",
    "when @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "since this is linear in @xmath75 , we can identify the dimension @xmath99 of @xmath100 . generally , if @xmath101 , then [ dim ] ( g ) = ( 2- ) ( g - g_c ) + .... where @xmath99 is the dimension of the perturbing operator .",
    "thus @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 we find [ 3.3 ] = ,  when   g_1 0 with this identification , the function matches the known two - loop result@xcite .",
    "since @xmath38 flows under rg , the above formula can not be valid for all @xmath29 since the exact s - matrix for the sg theory depends on an rg invariant @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "it is natural then that in general @xmath104 is a function of the rg invariant @xmath35 . matching ( [ 3.3 ] ) at @xmath42",
    "one finds [ 3.5 ] = we propose the above formula is valid for all @xmath29 .",
    "a non - trivial check is at @xmath43 where @xmath106 . again identifying @xmath107 through the dimension of @xmath100 , one finds [ 3.6 ]",
    "=  when  g_1 one sees that the expression ( [ 3.5 ] ) matches both ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) and thus has the right behavior at @xmath108 .",
    "this is of course consistent with duality ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "the flows that originate from @xmath42 , @xmath109 , have @xmath110 ; we thus identify this as a sg phase .",
    "thus we see that the very existence of a sine - gordon phase relies on the existence of the rg invariant @xmath35 .",
    "the flows that terminate at @xmath42 , @xmath68 , have @xmath111 .",
    "the operator @xmath100 is thus irrelevant and this is the massless kosterlitz - thouless phase .",
    "the other flows that originate from the @xmath38 axis correspond to a negative @xmath107 . letting @xmath112",
    ", we interpret this as a sinh - gordon phase ( shg ) with the action ( [ 3.2 ] ) where @xmath113 .",
    "this analytical continuation is compatible with the interpretation of the singularities at @xmath40 as consequences of instabilities of the kinetic term in eq.([3.2 ] ) .",
    "the region @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 whereas @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath116 , so the whole range of @xmath117 is covered .",
    "the flows all originate from the @xmath38 axis since @xmath118 is relevant for @xmath119 . repeating the above argument we find [ 3.7 ]",
    "=    consider now the roaming or cyclic rg flows of the last section",
    ". in this region @xmath35 is negative , @xmath120 .",
    "assuming it is valid in this regime , eq .",
    "( [ 3.5 ] ) implies then that @xmath107 has both real and imaginary parts so that it is neither sine - gordon nor sinh - gordon .",
    "this is actually reminiscent of zamolodchikov s staircase model@xcite .",
    "the staircase model corresponds to @xmath121 , which implies @xmath122 where @xmath123 . from ( [ 3.7 ] ) one sees that for small @xmath124 , @xmath125 , which is compatible with @xmath35 being negative .",
    "of course , more investigation is required for a better characterization of this phase .",
    "the above flows do not have non - trivial fixed points in _ both _ the uv and ir that can be compared with known results .",
    "however , by letting @xmath75 be imaginary , there are such flows .",
    "the resulting imaginary potential sine - gordon theory is known to possess both an ultra - violet and infra - red fixed point , both of which are @xmath126 gaussian conformal field theories at different radius of compactification@xcite@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic @xmath2 function precisely confirms this . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath127 .",
    "there is still a line of fixed points at @xmath61 . at small coupling @xmath128 ,",
    "thus the rg contours are circles rather than hyperbolas .",
    "this implies that flows can originate in the ultra - violet along the positive @xmath38 axis and end up at a different fixed point on the negative @xmath129 axis .",
    "the values of @xmath38 in the uv and ir can be determined from the rg invariance of @xmath35 . since @xmath130 at @xmath61 ,",
    "one finds [ imag ] = - let us express this result in terms of the anomalous dimension of the perturbation at the fixed points . as discussed above , using eq .",
    "( [ dim ] ) this gives @xmath131 at @xmath61 fixed points .",
    "using ( [ imag ] ) one finds [ uvir ] _ ir = this agrees precisely with the statements made in @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath132 relevant , @xmath133 is irrelevant as it should be .",
    "since ( [ uvir ] ) turns out to be exact , this strongly suggests there are no further corrections to the function .    for higher @xmath6 the above results",
    "are generalized to the fractional supersymmetric sine - gordon model@xcite .",
    "this serves as a mild check of the @xmath6 dependence of the function . in these models ,",
    "the interaction @xmath100 is replaced with @xmath134 where @xmath135 are @xmath136 parafermions of dimension @xmath137 .",
    "the case @xmath138 is the supersymmetric sine - gordon model .",
    "since @xmath139 when @xmath97 , repeating the above arguments we find [ fssg1 ] ^2_fssg = , g_1 0 > from the functions we find that the fractional supersymmetric sine - gordon regime corresponds to @xmath140 which corresponds to @xmath141 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this is not a strong check of the @xmath6 dependence since we have input the dimension of the parafermions by hand .",
    "in summary , by using duality and endowing the coupling constant space with some additional topological properties , we managed to interpret the rg flows at strong and weak coupling based on the functions proposed in @xcite .",
    "this supports the analytic continuation of the function to strong coupling .",
    "the cyclic or roaming rg trajectory we found needs further investigation .",
    "we point out that cyclic rg flows are ruled out under the assumptions of the c - theorem which shows that the central charge @xmath142 always decreases@xcite .",
    "though the action written in terms of currents is hermitian , the bosonized form indicates that in some domains the kinetic term can be negative .",
    "thus , presumably the assumption of positivity breaks down in the cyclic domain .",
    "we also remark that cyclic rg trajectories have previously occurred in certain problems in nuclear physics@xcite .",
    "we have extended the scheme described in this paper to the functions for the network model computed in @xcite and this will be described in a separate publication .",
