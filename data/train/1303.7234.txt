    "all that is left is the relatively blue `` quasi - continuum , '' which is likely produced by emission from many overlapping narrow lines of iron - group elements ( iges , mostly ) excited by the csm interaction , and h@xmath0  emission , which has weakened since the previous spectrum ( see below for further details ) .",
    "conspicuously , the near - infrared ( ir ) triplet , which is one of the strongest emission features in most of the late - time ptf11kx spectra , is almost completely gone by day + 680 .",

    "we find that the broader h@xmath0  component ( after removing the narrow component ) is mostly symmetric and slightly blueshifted , perhaps due to the csm being accelerated somewhat by the sn ejecta .",

    "the h@xmath0  flux also generally increases with time until a large drop is measured in the last spectrum .",

    "the factor of @xmath3  4 decrease shown by ptf11kx is larger than this prediction , but it occurs at similar epochs .",

    "the temporal evolution of the flux of these lines , along with the flux of the narrow component of h@xmath0emission , is displayed in the top panel of figure  [ f : ew_comp ] .",
    "the flux values have been scaled ( by factors of 2 , 2.5 , and 5 for [ ] @xmath163727 , [ ] @xmath165007 , and h@xmath4 , respectively ) in order to emphasize their common evolution .",

    "there may be some concern that slit losses , seeing effects , or contamination from nearby regions cause the observed variation in these lines with time .",
    "however , all observations later than 300  d past maximum brightness were taken under relatively good seeing conditions ( @xmath17 ) using a 1slit .",

    "the flux and ew of all four emission lines appear in general to decrease , remain constant for @xmath3  150  d , then perhaps increase again .",
    "however h@xmath0 , which is a recominbation line and can have a different timescale than the forbidden lines , sometimes behaves significantly differently when compared with the other lines .",
    "this could mean that the sn ejecta of ptf11kx are interacting with csm that is clumpy or perhaps composed of multiple thin shells , which is consistent with what was seen in the early - time spectra @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely to observe this behavior if the ejecta were expanding into csm with a monotonically increasing or decreasing density profile , as one might expect from a with a constant mass - loss rate .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the extreme late - time overluminosity of ptf11kx ( see  [ s : comparisons ] ) .",

    "the h@xmath0  emission is somewhat weaker in ptf11kx relative to that of sn  2010jl , but comparable to that of sn  2005gj .",
    "similarly , narrow h@xmath4  emission is detected in ptf11kx , but it is substantially weaker than h@xmath0  ( as mentioned in ",

    "the strength of the h@xmath4  feature in ptf11kx appears to be intermediate between those of sn  2010jl and sn  2005gj .",
    "higher - order balmer emission is easily seen in sn  2010jl , but completely undetected in ptf11kx and sn  2005gj .",
    "the broad peak in ptf11kx near 3900    and in ptf11kx and sn  2005gj near 8500    are almost certainly caused in part by  h&k and the near - ir triplet , respectively , and this latter feature is one of the strongest in both spectra ( with fwhm @xmath3  10,000  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "note that emission from these complexes is also seen in sne  iin and sne  ia at late times .",
    "in contrast to the + 316  d spectrum of ptf11kx shown in figure  [ f:11kx_comp ] , there is practically no emission from the near - ir triplet in the spectrum from 680  d past maximum brightness ( see fig .",
    "[ f : ptf11kx ] ) . a model for sne  ia - csm that includes",
    "a cool dense shell made up of many small fragments containing separate fe - poor and fe - rich zones predicts that emission should disappear once the two zones become fully mixed @xcite .",
    "this was seen to happen in sn  1999e at between 139 and 361  d past maximum @xcite , and we find the same behavior in ptf11kx but at a later epoch ( between 371 and 680  d past maximum ) .",
    "in all of the spectra shown in figure  [ f:11kx_comp ] , the blue flux dramatically increases shortward of @xmath3  5700   .",
    "the largest increase in flux at the blue end of the optical range appears in sn  1999aa , which comes from nebular emission lines from very iron - rich ejecta , excited by radioactivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the smallest increase in blue flux appears in sn  2010jl , where this blue `` quasi - continuum '' probably comes from numerous blended , narrow lines of iges excited by the csm interaction .",
    "ptf11kx ( as mentioned in ",
    "[ s : spectra ] ) and sn  2005gj have intermediate amounts of increased blue flux , and since we see evidence of strong csm interaction in these objects , this `` quasi - continuum '' is most likely a stronger version of what is seen in sn  2010jl and less like the nebular emission lines of more normal sne  ia ( such as sn  1999aa , also see below ) . as most of the optical flux in ptf11kx shortward of @xmath3  5700    comes from numerous ige multiplets , it is difficult to identify individual features in that wavelength range ( aside from  h&k and h@xmath4 ) , though some relatively narrow emission features can be tentatively identified .    the nearly complete lack of emission at @xmath3  7700    in ptf11kx ( as well as sn  2005gj ) leads us to believe that there is little to no oxygen present in their late - time spectra .",
    "nebular oxygen emission is a hallmark of core - collapse sne , and it appears in the spectrum of sn  2010jl presented in figure  [ f:11kx_comp ] . thus , this supports the notion that ptf11kx , and all sne  ia - csm in general , are in fact genuine sne  ia .",
    "furthermore , ptf11kx and sn  2005gj exhibit almost no ( see also  [ s : analysis ] ) , while the spectrum of sn  2010jl shows obvious emission lines from @xmath165876 and @xmath167065 .",
    "the almost total lack of oxygen and helium emission in the very late - time ptf11kx spectra imply that the broad , weak emission near 7300    is caused either by [ ] , as it likely is in sn  2010jl , or by [ ] and [ ] , which is what is seen in more typical sne  ia at these epochs .",
    "we favor the former option since ptf11kx shows no convincing evidence for strong , broad emission features due to [ ] , [ ] , or [ ] in any of the observations .",
    "these forbidden emission features from iges that are typically seen in more normal sne  ia at late times ( @xmath20  d ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may not be detected in ptf11kx since they have been diluted by broad - band continuum flux from the ongoing csm interaction .",
    "@xcite found that ptf11kx is @xmath3  16 times more luminous than typical sne  ia at @xmath3  100  d past maximum brightness , while more recent observations ( shown in fig .

    "d ) ] and the large late - time luminosity of ptf11kx are inconsistent with a csm model that includes a wind with a constant mass - loss rate ( i.e. , @xmath21 , * ? ? ?",

    "it looks quite unlike sn  1999aa , even though it closely resembled this object spectroscopically at early times @xcite .",
    "nebular spectra of other types of sne  ia were also compared with those of ptf11kx , including the overluminous sn  1991 t @xcite and the normal sn  2011fe ( bianco et al .  in prep . ) , but as with sn  1999aa , they did not provide good matches .",
    "a variety of other sne  iin were compared to ptf11kx , and in all cases they either closely resembled the spectrum of sn  2010jl presented in figure  [ f:11kx_comp ] or looked completely different from both sn  2010jl _ and _ ptf11kx .",
    "finally , we compared ptf11kx to late - time spectra of the normal type  ic sn  1994i @xcite and the grb - associated type  ic sn  1998bw @xcite ; we found that while both have a similar amounts of blue flux , the spectra of sne  1994i and 1998bw are dominated by [ ] @xmath166300 , [ ] @xmath22 , and ] @xmath164571 emission , which is in stark contrast to the nebular spectra of ptf11kx ( and the other sne  ia - csm ; e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we have presented and analyzed late - time spectra of ptf11kx ranging from 124 to 680  d past maximum brightness . while the sn shows very little overall spectral evolution during these epochs ( except for the last spectrum ) , we find that the broader ( @xmath3  2000  km  s@xmath2 ) h@xmath0emission appears to increase in strength with time for @xmath3  1  yr , after which time it decreases significantly , perhaps indicating that the sn ejecta have overtaken most of the csm .",

    "the extremely slow decline rate at late times , @xmath3  0.2  mag/(100  d ) , and the large late - time luminosity , 49  mag brighter than a typical sn  ia , are almost certainly caused by the interaction between the sn ejecta of ptf11kx and the csm .",

    "<S> ptf11kx was a type  ia supernova ( sn  ia ) that showed time - variable absorption features , including saturated  h&k lines that weakened and eventually went into emission </S>",
    "<S> . the strength of the emission component of h@xmath0  gradually increased , implying that the sn was undergoing significant interaction with its circumstellar medium ( csm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these features , and many others , were blueshifted slightly and showed a p - cygni profile , likely indicating that the csm was directly related to , and probably previously ejected by , the progenitor system itself . </S>",
    "<S> these and other observations led dilday et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2012 ) to conclude that ptf11kx came from a symbiotic nova progenitor like rs  oph . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we extend the spectral coverage of ptf11kx to 124680 rest - frame days past maximum brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the late - time spectra of ptf11kx are dominated by h@xmath0  emission ( with widths of full width at half - maximum intensity @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) , strong emission features ( @xmath3  10,000  km  s@xmath2  wide ) , and a blue `` quasi - continuum '' due to many overlapping narrow lines of . </S>",
    "<S> emission from oxygen , , and balmer lines higher than h@xmath0  is weak or completely absent at all epochs , leading to large observed h@xmath0/h@xmath4  intensity ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0  emission appears to increase in strength with time for @xmath3  1  yr , but it subsequently decreases significantly along with the emission . </S>",
    "<S> our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility of newly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the red wing of h@xmath0 . during the same epochs , multiple narrow emission features from the csm temporally </S>",
    "<S> vary in strength . </S>",
    "<S> the weakening of the h@xmath0  and emission at late times is possible evidence that the sn ejecta have overtaken the majority of the csm and agrees with models of other strongly interacting sne  ia . the varying narrow emission features , on the other hand , may indicate that the csm is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells . </S>"
