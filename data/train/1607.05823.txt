    "special attention has been devoted to polytropes since more than a century , and is continuing to be devoted at present .",
    "in fact , polytropic models are useful not only for the rough estimates of some processes in real stars , but also in the precise investigation of some matters of principle , such as the effect of increasing central condensation on nonradial pulsation models [ 26 ] , the structure of supermassive and superdense stars [ 42 ] , the collapse of stellar cores [ 17 ] , the fission and the equatorial shedding of matter due to rotation [ 24 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 19 ] , the oscillation and stability of rapidly rotating stellar models [ 38 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 32 ] , the structure of neutron stars and quark stars [ 16 ] , [ 25 ] , the expression of the total mass of a rotating configuration as a function of the central density [ 35 ] , equilibrium configurations and triaxiality in stars and stellar systems [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] . for exhaustive review and complete references , an interested reader",

    "polytropes can provide a continuous transition from null to infinite matter concentration i.e. homogeneous and roche ( mass points surrounded by vanishing atmospheres ) models , distorted by rotation and/or tidal interaction [ 24 ] , chap.ix ,  235 .    on the other hand , large - scale stellar systems ( galaxies and galaxy clusters ) appear to be made of at least two subsystems interacting only via gravitation e.g. , bulge+disk , core+halo , visible baryonic ( including leptons)+dark nonbaryonic matter .",
    "in most applications , each component is treated separately and the model is a simple superposition of the two matter distributions e.g. , [ 12 ] . to this respect ,",
    "models involving two - component polytropes make a further step in that each subsystem readjusts itself in presence of tidal interaction [ 10 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] and , in addition , both collisional and collisionless fluids can be described within the range of polytropic index , @xmath1 , [ 39 ] where @xmath3 relates to homogeneous and roche or plummer models , respectively .",
    "the current paper aims to improve and extend earlier investigation on two - component polytropes [ 10 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , mainly focusing on the following points : ( i ) formulation of the theory where due effort is devoted to the connection with one - component polytropes ; ( ii ) extension of the theory to subsystems with nonzero density on the boundary ; ( iii ) extension of the theory to subsystems with intersecting boundaries ; ( iv ) extension of the theory to collisionless fluids ; ( v ) series expansion of the solution of equilibrium equations , which can be continued up to the boundary and outside , via starting points placed at increasingly larger distance from the centre of mass ; ( vi ) detailed analysis of special cases where the solution of equilibrium equations can be expressed analytically ; ( vii ) a guidance example involving homogeneous subsystems with intersecting boundaries , where a substantially flattened component extends outside a slightly flattened one .",

    "similarly to distorted ec1 polytropes [ 13 ] , [ 15 ] , distorted ec2 polytropes [ 10 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] can be described in terms of solutions of associated ec2 equations , eqs.([eq : t0n])-([eq : t2ln ] ) and ( [ eq : t0c])-([eq : t2lc ] ) for the noncommon and the common region , respectively .",

    "it has been recognized the contrary holds for the common region , where the solution of ec2 equation and associated ec2 equations involves both subsystems instead of only one , leaving aside a few special cases .",

    "<S> with respect to earlier investigations , the theory of multi - component , concentric , copolar , axisymmetric , rigidly rotating polytropes is improved and extended , including subsystems with nonzero density on the boundary and subsystems with intersecting boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation is restricted to two subsystems for simplicity but , in principle , can be extended to @xmath0 subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium configurations are independent of the nature of the fluid i.e. collisional or collisionless , provided the polytropic index lies within the range , @xmath1 , as in one - component systems . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the equilibrium equations is expanded in power series , which can be continued up to the boundary and outside via starting points placed at increasingly larger distance from the centre of mass . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis is devoted to special cases where the solution of the equilibrium equations can be expressed analytically . finally a guidance example is shown , involving homogeneous subsystems with intersecting boundaries , where a substantially flattened component extends outside a slightly flattened one .    # 1#1    [ section ]    </S>",
