    "theoretical stellar evolution models , color transformations and bolometric corrections are essential ingredients for interpreting photometric data of resolved and unresolved stellar systems . a reliable comparison of theory with observations requires , in principle , that the element abundance distribution employed in the theoretical models closely matches the pattern in the observed stellar systems .    whereas the standard heavy element distribution generally used in stellar evolution computation is the solar one , there are cases where this assumption is not correct .",
    "a remarkable example is the galactic halo , whose stellar component ( field and globular cluster stars ) shows a ratio [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath10 ( e.g. lambert  1989 ) where @xmath0 denotes elements like o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca and ti . the effect on stellar models and isochrones of a metal ratio",

    "we wish to emphasize that here we are comparing differentially our two sets of ct transformations , using the same underlying isochron .",

    "we could have compared the ct transformation tables on a point by point basis , but with our approach we are automatically making the comparison within a parameter space typical of stars populating the galactic halo .",
    "the most important outcomes of this analysis are the qualitative differences between the cmds obtained employing the two sets of transformations .",
    "since until now all results based on theoretical @xmath0-enhanced isochrones have been obtained by employing in principle inappropriate scaled - solar ct transformations , our analysis will allow to establish what results can be trusted and the ones that can not .",

    "2000 @xmath0-enhanced isochrones ) , as long as they reasonably approximate the [ fe / h ] , surface gravity and effective temperature range of halo stars . however , the precise numerical values of the differences can be slightly dependent on the selected theoretical isochrone .",

    "we briefly notice here that the relationship between [ fe / h ] and [ m / h ] for the scaled - solar grevesse & sauval  ( 1998 ) metal distribution and [ @xmath0/fe ] values typical of the galactic halo , is well approximated by the following relationship given by salaris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : [ m / h]=[fe / h]+log(0.638  f  + 0.362 ) , where log(f)=[@xmath0/fe ] .",
    "we have first transformed the three isochrones using the @xmath3enhanced transformations ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figiso ] ) for the appropriate [ fe / h ] ( hence [ m / h ] ) .",
    "then we used scaled - solar transformations , as routinely done in the literature , although it is not usually specified how they are applied to @xmath3enhanced models .",
    "the issue is that , when employing scaled - solar transformations , one has to appropriately choose the independent variable for the interpolation among the ct transformation tables ( the same choice has to be made when comparing the corresponding transformation tables ) .",
    "there are two simple and natural choices for this .",
    "the first one is to consider the total metallicity [ m / h ] of the @xmath3enhanced models , and determine the scaled - solar transformations at the same [ m / h ] .",
    "this means that the individual metal abundances used in the transformations are different from the models , but the global metal content is the same ; in our case , the fe abundance for the scaled solar synthetic colors would be about 0.3 dex higher than the proper one .",
    "our isochrones transformed in this way are displayed as short dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figiso ] .",
    "the second possibility is to consider scaled - solar transformations with the same [ fe / h ] of the @xmath3enhanced models ; this choice assumes that it is the fe abundance ( and eventually the elements that are not enhanced with respect to fe ) that contributes mostly to the observed colors and bolometric corrections .",
    "this also means that the transformations would take into account the appropriate abundance of fe and other scaled - solar elements , while underestimating the abundance of the @xmath3elements by 0.4 dex in our case .",
    "isochrones transformed in this way are shown as long dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figiso ] .",
    "figure  [ figiso ] shows clearly that the ( m@xmath31 ) cmd , regardless of the cluster metallicity , is unaffected by the ct choice ( the same is true for metallicities below z=0.001 ) ; this holds also for ( m@xmath32 ) and other near infrared cmds included in our set of transformations .",
    "this result is hardly surprising , since in general @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 color transformations are weakly sensitive to the metal content . also @xmath38 values appear to be very weakly affected by the selected transformations .",
    "the case of bluer colors like @xmath4 and @xmath5 is quite different .",

    "there are discrepancies of a few hundredths of magnitudes in the colors ( which are reduced at lower metallicities to within @xmath390.01 mag for [ fe / h]=@xmath72 ) ; these differences increase with increasing metallicity , and are larger in @xmath5 than in @xmath4 . in general",
    ", scaled - solar color transformations selected on the basis of the isochrone [ m / h ] do produce redder @xmath4 and @xmath5 values .",
    "the color shift between the two sets of transformations is also a function of the effective temperature ; it generally increases for decreasing @xmath8 , as clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ figiso ] .",
    "the global effect is therefore also a slight change of the isochrone morphology in the ( m@xmath40 ) and ( m@xmath41 ) cmds .",
    "however , since the @xmath42 photometry is employed mainly for studying hot hb stars , which are hot enough to be unaffected by the choice of the transformations , the differences are not extremely relevant when using this color index.enhanced mixtures , that is to use scaled - solar transformations computed for the same [ @xmath0/h ] abundance of the @xmath3enhanced models . in this way",
    "one assumes that mainly the @xmath3elements affect the transformations ; the chosen metal content for the scaled - solar transformations would have in this case a fe abundance 0.4  dex higher than the proper @xmath3enhanced distribution .",
    "the data plotted in fig",
    ".  [ figiso ] , clearly show that this choice would produce the worst results , since it would correspond to a scaled - solar [ m / h ] value 0.4 dex higher than the actual one , hence yielding even redder @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors .",
    "] when considering the case of scaled - solar transformations with the same [ fe / h ] of the @xmath3enhanced mixture , the results are practically identical at [ fe / h ] of the order of @xmath72.0 and in general one obtains a better agreement with the appropriate @xmath3enhanced transformations ; however , the discrepancies are non negligible when z@xmath390.001 , increasing with both metal content and decreasing @xmath8 . at first",
    "it may appear surprising that @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors at the same [ fe / h ] are bluer in the @xmath3enhanced case , when the total metal content is higher .",
    "figure  [ figflux ] shows the differences between the flux predicted for a typical @xmath3enhanced ms model with [ fe / h]=@xmath71 , and scaled - solar models with either the same [ fe / h ] ( solid line ) or the same [ m / h ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "the @xmath3enhanced model shows a larger flux in the @xmath42 part of the spectrum with respect to the scaled - solar counterpart with the same [ fe / h ] , and a qualitative analysis of the figure shows clearly that the @xmath3enhanced @xmath5 and @xmath4 indices have to be bluer . on the other hand , colors built from passbands bluer than @xmath24 may provide different results .",
    "it is in fact evident from fig .",
    "[ figflux ] that , e.g. , around @xmath43=280 nm ( log(@xmath43)@xmath392.45 ) the @xmath3enhanced flux is definitely lower than the scaled - solar counterparts .    in order to explain the differences highlighted by fig .",
    "[ figflux ] , one needs to assess the role played by the different @xmath3elements in modifying the stellar flux with respect to a scaled - solar mixture .",
    "it is clear that , for an exhaustive analysis , one should compute a set of model atmospheres for several gravities and effective temperatures , by changing the abundance of each individual @xmath0 element at constant [ fe / h ] .",
    "this notwithstanding  prompted by the referee  we have obtained relevant preliminary results by computing selected models for the same [ fe / h ] , gravity and @xmath8 as in fig .",

    "instead , the oxygen abundance affects the flux distribution in the region of the u and v bands through the numerous oh lines lying mostly shortward of the balmer discontinuity .",
    "figure  [ figelement ] shows differences @xmath46(flux ) between the flux predicted for models with only the labeled @xmath0 element enhanced ( by 0.4 dex each ) , and the scaled solar case with the same [ fe / h]=@xmath71.0 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath46(flux ) values between the complete @xmath0-enhanced model and the scaled solar one with the same [ fe / h ] , @xmath8 and @xmath49 is also displayed .",
    "we focused our analysis on the wavelength region where the largest @xmath46(flux ) values contributing to the discrepancies in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters are found .",
    "one can notice how @xmath46(flux ) between the complete @xmath0-enhanced model and the scaled solar one is essentially due to just o , si , mg and ca . calcium contributes mainly to the absorption at @xmath50390 nm , whereas o and mg play a major role in the differences at @xmath51 nm ( apart from the ca absorption mentioned before ) . in addition , si and mg are the most important contributors to the region shortward of @xmath39350 nm .",
    "table  1 displays the @xmath5 and @xmath4 colors predicted by the same model atmospheres whose flux difference are shown in fig .  [ figelement ] ; this allows us to assess quantitatively how much these individual @xmath0 elements affect the broadband @xmath52 colors .",
    "magnesium appears to be the main responsible for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 color differences between the scaled solar mixture and the full @xmath3enhanced one ; in fact , by enhancing only mg one recovers 88% and 76% of the differences in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "oxygen has a smaller but non negligible impact on the @xmath4 color whereas the @xmath5 color is affected appreciably also by silicon .",
    "calcium and the other @xmath0 elements have only a minor impact on these two colors at this @xmath8 and gravity .    prompted by our referee , to investigate the effects due to surface gravity changes along an isochrone , we have computed additional model atmospheres by enhancing the abundance of each individual @xmath3element , at the same [ fe / h ] and effective temperature as above , but for @xmath53 .",
    "we obtain results similar to the case with @xmath48  as one could also expect by comparing the ct tables for scaled solar and full @xmath0-enhanced mixtures at these two gravities  the main difference being that , whereas at @xmath48 the most important @xmath3element for the @xmath42 flux distribution is mg , in this case the contributions provided by mg and si are comparable .    table  2 lists the differences between some relevant features of the three sets of isochrones displayed in fig .  [ figiso ] .",
    "in particular , we wish to briefly discuss the @xmath4 color of the main sequence ( ms ) at m@xmath54=6 ( @xmath55 ) , the absolute visual magnitude of the turn off ( to ) , the color difference @xmath56 between the to and the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the absolute i - cousins magnitude of the rgb tip and the absolute visual magnitude of the zahb at the level of the instability strip .",
    "these quantities are usually employed in studies about distance and age determinations of old stellar populations . in the following",
    "we will refer to the use of scaled - solar transformations with the same [ m / h ] of the @xmath3enhanced mixture , which produce the larger differences .",
    "the @xmath55 color ( taken as representative magnitude of the unevolved ms in globular clusters ) enters the ms fitting method for deriving cluster distances ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2000 , percival et al .",
    "in fact , the color shifts applied to individual subdwarfs in order to  their own metallicity to that of the considered cluster , are usually derived from theoretical isochrones , at least in the regime of globular cluster metallicities .",
    "the data listed in table  2 show that the @xmath55 difference between the metallicities displayed in fig .",
    "[ figiso ] does depend on the choice of the transformations , and are about 20% smaller when using the appropriate @xmath3enhanced transformations .",
    "this discrepancy may however have only a small impact on the derived distances as long as the subdwarfs employed in the ms - fitting have metallicities close to the cluster one , hence the color shifts applied are small .",
    "the @xmath4 color extension between to and rgb , @xmath57 , is also clearly strongly affected . following rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , here we have defined @xmath57 as the color difference between the to and a point on the rgb 2.5  mag brighter than the to .",
    "this quantity is a function of the cluster age , but it is generally used only in a differential way in order to determine relative cluster ages ( e.g. vandenberg , bolte & stetson  1990 , salaris & weiss  1998 , rosenberg et al .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath57 change by @xmath39 0.03 - 0.04 mag , depending on the metallicity ; this would cause an age variation by @xmath39 2 - 3 gyr if @xmath57 is used to estimate absolute ages . when differences of @xmath57 at varying ages are used for relative age estimates",
    ", the impact of the ct transformation choice is however almost negligible .    as for the m@xmath54 values of to and zahb at the rr lyrae instability strip  whose difference is usually employed to estimate cluster ages  they are affected by the adopted ct relation at the level of @xmath14 0.01 mag , which has a negligible impact on the age estimates .",
    "we have in addition verified that , at a fixed metallicity , the range of masses populating the rr  lyrae instability strip is basically unaffected by the choice of the transformations .",
    "also the @xmath10 magnitude of the rgb tip ( a widely used distance indicator for old stellar populations , see e.g. lee , freedman & madore  1993 , salaris & cassisi  1998 and references therein ) is unaffected by the choice of the transformations , the variation being of the order of @xmath390.01 mag , which has a negligible impact on the distance determinations .",
    "it is well known that in order to integrate the stellar structure equations , it is necessary to fix the value of the pressure and temperature at the stellar surface , usually close to the photosphere .",
    "there are basically two possibilities to determine this value .",
    "the first one is to integrate the atmospheric layers by using a @xmath12 relationship , supplemented by the hydrostatic equilibrium condition and the equation of state ; the second possibility is to obtain the required boundary conditions from precomputed non - gray model atmospheres .    the first procedure is universally used in stellar model computation ; i.e. , in our stellar evolution calculations employed above we have used the krishna - swamy  ( 1966 ) solar @xmath12 relationship . in salaris ,",
    "cassisi & weiss  ( 2002 ) we have already shown that in case of scaled - solar models , the @xmath12 integration and boundary conditions from model atmospheres ( belonging to a previous atlas  9 release ) provide rgb tracks that agree within about 50  k.    here we repeat the test on scaled - solar models and for the first time we add a corresponding test for an @xmath0-enhanced mixture , using the updated atlas  9 model grid discussed in the previous section .",
    "figure  [ figboundcon ] shows the evolutionary tracks of a 0.9@xmath13 star with a turn off age of @xmath39 10.5 gyr , from the beginning of the ms up to the rgb tip , in the log@xmath11-@xmath8 plane .",
    "four different tracks are displayed , corresponding to the pair z=0.004 , y=0.251 , for scaled solar and @xmath0-enhanced metal distributions , computed using boundary conditions from both a @xmath12 integration and non - gray model atmospheres with the appropriate metal mixture .",
    "the boundary conditions from the model atmospheres were taken at @xmath58=56 . in both scaled - solar and @xmath0-enhanced case",
    "the ms is completely insensitive to the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "the rgb part is slightly affected , at the level of at most 40  k , the model atmosphere tracks being cooler .",
    "the effect of this temperature change on the predicted colors is the following : @xmath59 mag , @xmath60 mag , @xmath61 mag .",
