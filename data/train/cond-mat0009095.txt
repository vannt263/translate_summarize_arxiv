    "in depth filtration , suspended particles in a fluid are removed during their passage through a porous medium@xcite .",
    "the basic dynamics of depth filtration is determined primarily by the pore structure of the filter , the particle size distribution , and by various physicochemical and hydrodynamic details .",
    "if the particle size is larger than the typical pore size , particles get stuck relatively quickly .",
    "the permeability of the filter decreases steadily during this process and drops to zero when clogging is reached .",
    "this process is often referred to as sieving , or straining@xcite .",
    "conversely , if particles are much smaller than the pore size and if particles are trapped only at the interfaces of the porous medium , the flow field is only slightly affected by the trapping .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a general understanding of this latter process of _ infiltration _ by microscopic network modeling .",
    "2.0 cm .4 cm    infiltration underlies many practical situations , such as underground waste disposal @xcite , gas mask design , or drinking water filters @xcite .",
    "typically , sub - micron size contaminant particles are suspended in a carrier fluid and flow through a porous material , such as a sand filter whose typical grain size is much larger than the contaminant particles , or an ion exchange filter@xcite where the contaminant size is molecular in scale . in such cases , one can neglect the change of the flow field due to particle trapping @xcite , an approximation which considerably simplifies theoretical analysis .",
    "the kinetics of infiltration is controlled by the microscopic mechanisms for the trapping of the invader particles .",
    "typically each pore can hold a limited number of particles due to a finite surface area or a finite range of the surface potential .",
    "when all the available surface area is covered by particles , subsequent invaders flow passively through the filter without being trapped .",
    "our basic goal is to understand the kinetics of this infiltration and the ultimate breakthrough of the invader , as well as the evolution of the invader and defender density profiles as functions of downstream position and time .",
    "previous work on infiltration in porous media has often been based on a macroscopic convection - diffusion equation description , with reaction terms introduced to account for particle trapping @xcite .",
    "another approach has been to use a single absorbing sphere to calculate the collection efficiency at the initial stage of filtration@xcite .",
    "while numerical simulations of these models have some predictive power , it is hard to develop a connection between this macroscopic approach and basic features of the microscopic process , such as the concentration profiles of the trapped and flowing particles .    for filtration by straining , models based on a discrete network description of the filter medium",
    "are relatively well developed @xcite . to our knowledge , however , there has been no microscopic network modeling work on infiltration . as in the case of straining",
    ", a spatial density gradient naturally arises in infiltration , since particles begin to deposit at the upstream end of the filter and advance downstream as the filter gets used up .",
    "the density gradient is experimentally observed as the time - dependent output concentration @xcite . in this paper , we will account for this basic experimental observation by using a discrete network approach .",
    "practical questions raised by infiltration are the breakthrough time , which is defined as the time for the output concentration to reach a specified threshold level , and the filter efficiency , which is related to the fraction of the filter material actually used before breakthrough . clearly , it is desirable to use as much of the filter material as possible before breakthrough occurs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ basic ] , we introduce the basic parameters that govern particle trapping and provide a qualitative picture of infiltration . in the following sections , we construct a sequence of discrete models with increasing complexity and realism to ultimately provide a lattice network description . in sec",
    ".  [ 1d ] , we discuss the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of trapping sites and in sec .",
    "[ bubble ] , we analyze infiltration in the bubble model to provide a mean - field - like description .",
    "building on these results , we then turn to simulations of infiltration on tube lattice networks in sec .",
    "[ network ] .",
    "we summarize and compare our results with experiments in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the two basic characteristics of particle trapping are the efficiency of an unoccupied trapping site and the number of trapping sites in a pore .",
    "we introduce the trapping probability @xmath0 as the probability that a particle is trapped upon encountering an open collector site .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 thus represents the strength of the particle - collector interaction and accounts for the possibility that contact between particles and the filter grains may not necessarily lead to deposition @xcite .",
    "while this simplifies the complicated adsorption mechanism , later we show that the basic feature such as the invasion front propagation velocity ( fig.[fig1 ] ) is independent of the interaction details .",
    "next we introduce the capacity @xmath1 as the number of particles a pore at position @xmath2 can hold at time @xmath3 . in the case of non - coagulating particles",
    "which can not get trapped on top of an already adsorbed particle , the initial capacity is proportional to the inner surface area of the pore and then decreases as the pore surface is covered by particles . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore multiple trapping on an already occupied collector site as well as particle re - launching .",
    "the key factors which determine the dynamic behavior of the system are geometric , such as the capacity of a clean filter and the pore size distribution , and kinematic , such as the particle concentration and the flow rate .",
    "more refined models for particle trapping can be incorporated within our basic modeling .",
    "consider a generic infiltration process based on the above concepts .",
    "initially a layer in the clean filter has a total capacity @xmath4 independent of the downstream position . at @xmath5 , a fluid which contains",
    "a mixture of invader and non - reacting tracer particles enters the filter whose flow rate is determined by the steady - state solution of darcy s law .",
    "tracer particles passively follow the fluid motion and advance with the average flow velocity @xmath6 . the width of the tracer density profile spreads as @xmath7 due to hydrodynamic dispersion ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "invader particles first encounter clean collector sites . because each such encounter leads to deposition with probability @xmath0 , the survival probability of the particles in this leading invaded region decreases exponentially with downstream position as illustrated in fig .",
    "as particles advance and get trapped , the pore capacity decreases and subsequent particles are more likely to survive , giving rise to an advancing invasion front with a velocity @xmath8 . in principle , the propagation velocity and shape of the front are functions of time .",
    "however , at long times these features approach steady - state values .",
    "feature is that the trailing edge of the capacity profile decays as a power of the distance @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) from the invasion front whose location is defined , _",
    "e.g. _ , as the position where @xmath11 . for large @xmath9 , any reasonable definition for the front location can be used .",
    "the existence of different propagation velocities , @xmath6 for the pure fluid and @xmath8 for the contaminant , leads to purification of the liquid .",
    "the filter can be used until the invaded region reaches the outlet end . for a filter of length @xmath12",
    ", the breakthrough time will be of the order of @xmath13 , so the amount of throughput will be approximately proportional to @xmath14",
    ".    0.25 cm .6 cm",
    "as a preliminary , we study infiltration in a one - dimensional chain of identical pores at @xmath15 .",
    "first we consider the case where each pore can accommodate only one particle and then we generalize to multiple capacity pores .",
    "we choose a time unit such that one particle is injected at each discrete time step .",
    "multiple particle injection leads to a different particle density and will affect only the overall scale factor and not change qualitative features of the system .",
    "the carrier fluid advances by one pore distance at each time step ; that is , its velocity is unity .",
    "when particle trapping occurs in a pore at @xmath16 , the capacity @xmath17 changes permanently from 1 to 0 . at time @xmath3 , a particle at pore @xmath16 gets trapped in that pore with probability @xmath0 if @xmath18 .",
    "a particle advances to the next pore in one time step with probability 1 if @xmath19 .",
    "based on these elemental steps , we introduce the following two probability densities :    * @xmath20 : the probability that a freely - moving particle is in pore @xmath16 at time @xmath3 . * @xmath21 : the probability that the pore at site @xmath16 is unoccupied ; that is @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding master equations for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 where we drop the argument @xmath3 on the right hand side for simplicity . unless there is a possibility for confusion , we will not write the argument @xmath3 in related formulae . since a particle advances to the next",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the symmetry between the invader and defender is generally responsible for the relation @xmath46 . at the inlet ,",
    "invaders are injected with velocity @xmath6 , and the invasion front advances with velocity @xmath35 , with one invader particle annihilating with one defender site . in the reference frame moving with velocity @xmath6 , the situation is reversed .",

    ". therefore the invasion front advances with velocity @xmath70 .",
    "since these two reference frames describe the system in the same way , the front velocities should be the same ; that is , @xmath71 , or @xmath46 .",
    "now we consider the case where each pore can trap @xmath72 particles , that is , the initial pore capacity is @xmath73 .",
    "we again follow the previous rules of injecting a single particle and advancing a particle by one pore ( @xmath74 ) at each time step .",
    "multiple particle injection or different injection intervals again simply changes the overall concentration and time scale . in a multiple capacity pore",
    ", the probability of encountering an open trap in a pore needs be considered , in addition to the trapping probability @xmath0 upon encounter with an open trap .",
    "generally , the encounter probability decreases as more particles get trapped , since the inner pore surface area available for trapping shrinks .",
    "when fluid mixing within a pore is weak , a particle can encounter only one trap , either open or occupied .",
    "then the encounter probability is approximately proportional to the fraction of the open surface area . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mixing is perfect , a particle encounters all the available traps in a pore before exiting .    for practically relevant situations ,",

    "[ discussion ] , we argue that this volumetric effect does not change the basic behavior of infiltration .",
    "to describe the evolution of the system , we use the same single - particle probability density @xmath20 as in the single - capacity pore system , but modify the probability density for the capacity as follows :    * @xmath78 : the probability that a pore at position @xmath16 contains @xmath75 open traps .",

    "we simplify eqs .",
    "( [ mulmep ] ) and ( [ mulmeq ] ) by introducing the _ average capacity _ of a pore at position @xmath16 , @xmath88 this gives the average number of sites still available for trapping in the pore .",
    "now by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ mulmeq ] ) by @xmath75 , summing from 1 to @xmath72 , and using @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 these are identical in form to eqs .",
    "( [ 1dmep ] ) and ( [ 1dmeq ] ) , so the same steady state analysis applies .",

    "the boundary conditions are also the same as in the case of single - capacity pores , except @xmath93 . combining these results",

    "( [ mulvw ] ) reduces to the single capacity case , while for @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "this means that there is no steady state for the case of infinite capacity pores .",
    "we can generalize the symmetry argument given in the single capacity case to find the propagation velocity in eq .",
    "( [ mulvw ] ) . at the input ,",
    "the flux of invaders moving with the carrier fluid is equal to @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , in the reference frame moving with velocity @xmath6 , the flux of defenders is @xmath99 , while the invaders are at rest . because one invader annihilates with one defender , the two particles are kinetically indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , if a particle flux of @xmath98 results in a front moving with velocity @xmath35 , the front velocity produced by a flux of @xmath99 should be @xmath100 , which , in turn , equals @xmath70 in the moving reference frame . by this equivalence , eq .",
    "( [ mulvw ] ) immediately follows .    in the limit of perfect mixing",
    ", a particle encounters all traps in the pore .",
    "the overall trapping probability with @xmath75 open traps is then @xmath101 . in the limit of small @xmath0 , @xmath102 ,",
    "thus the analysis is exactly the same as in the poor mixing case except without the factor @xmath103 in @xmath104 .",
    "the propagation velocity of the front is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ mulvw ] ) , since this velocity is independent of trapping mechanism , while the width varies as @xmath105 .",
    "notice that @xmath49 is a decreasing function of @xmath72 .",
    "this arises because a particle must survive all the traps in a pore before advancing to the next pore .",
    "finally , for a mixing mechanism which is intermediate between the two limits of perfect and poor mixing , the propagation velocity will be @xmath106 , while the width of the front will lie between the limiting values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we now study the bubble model as a logical next step towards understanding infiltration in porous media .",
    "the bubble model was introduced to account for the breaking of fibers @xcite , extremal voltages in resistor networks @xcite , and later to filtration kinetics @xcite .",
    "the bubble model consists of @xmath12 `` bubbles '' in series , each of which is a parallel bundle of @xmath49 tubes , with each tube representing a pore ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . a bubble can be viewed as a single layer of parallel bonds in a lattice with all the ends `` shorted '' .",
    "this model has multiple paths , as in real porous media , and is sufficiently simple to be amenable to analytic study .",
    "a useful feature of the bubble model is that for straining dominated filtration , this model predicts similar behavior to that of lattice networks @xcite .",

    "we assume identical tube lengths and measure downstream distance in units of the tube length , which is set equal to 1 .",
    "we also assume that the flow rate in a tube of radius @xmath111 is proportional to @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the pressure gradient along the tube and @xmath114 depends on the nature of the flow , with @xmath115 corresponding to poiseuille flow and @xmath116 to euler flow .",
    "perfect mixing is assumed at each node .",
    "a particle chooses a tube in the next downstream bubble according to _ flow induced probability _",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath118 in which the probability of choosing an outgoing tube of radius @xmath111 is proportional to the flow rate into the tube , @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "since tubes of different flow velocities give the dominant mechanism for dispersion , the radial dependence of the local flow velocity in a tube ( taylor dispersion ) is ignored .",
    "thus we assume that a particle moves with the average flow velocity @xmath120 along the tube .",
    "we now investigate the hydrodynamic dispersion of passive brownian particles which are carried by the background fluid in the bubble model , in the absence of any trapping .",
    "this will provide the concepts and tools necessary to understand infiltration in the bubble model .      in the large @xmath49 limit ,",
    "each bubble is nearly identical , and we can regard the particle motion as a directed random walk in which the average residence time @xmath121 in bubble @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) is a random variable whose distribution @xmath122 is related to the flow induced entrance probability @xmath117 and the radius distribution @xmath123 .",
    "this random walk description of the continuous particle motion introduces an additional stochasticity into the system .",
    "however , we will show below that this only modifies the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient by an overall multiplicative factor .",

( [ hydrow ] )",
    "gives a nonzero dispersion coefficient .",
    "as mentioned above , this arises from the stochasticity of the random walk picture for the particle motion . for the practically relevant case of @xmath139 , the effect of this stochasticity",
    "is only to change the dispersion coefficient by a factor of order unity .      to describe infiltration in the bubble model",

    "the capacity of a tube is proportional to its inner surface area , which is proportional to the tube radius , since all tubes have the same length .",
    "last , the overall trapping probability of a tube is equal to the microscopic trapping probability @xmath0 multiplied by the fraction of open traps in a tube ( sec .  [ 1dmulti ] ) .",
    "to simulate this process efficiently we propagate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the suspended particles rather than simulating the motion of individual particles@xcite .",
    "the pdf propagation therefore provides the exact distribution of particle positions and tube capacities for a single realization of tube radii .",
