    "@xcite ) , or a dynamical dark energy ( de ) component , that drives cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "if the de is given by a @xmath3 term , besides having a non - trivial fine - tuning problem to solve ( unless one resorts to an anthropic argument ) , one does not know why @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both of order unity today . in these years alternative routes",
    "have been followed , for example _ quintessence _",

    "@xcite ( a complete list of dark energy models can be found in the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the k - essence is characterized by a lagrangian with non - canonical kinetic term and it is inspired by earlier studies of k - inflation @xcite .",
    "some models of k - essence have solutions which tend toward dynamical attractors in the cosmic evolution so that their late - time behavior becomes insensitive to initial conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other models , besides having this property allow to avoid fine - tunning and are able to explain the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was realized that the latter models @xcite have too small a basin of attraction in the radiation era @xcite and lead to superluminal propagation of field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "an important issue is whether the dark matter clustering is influenced by the dark energy and if , when this happens , the dark energy can indirectly smooth the cusp profiles of dark matter at small radii .",
    "another hypothesis is to consider a single fluid that behaves both as dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the latter class of models has been dubbed _ unified dark matter _ ( udm ) . among several models of k - essence considered in the literature there",

    "the generalized chaplygin model can be obtained via a born - infeld - type lagrangian .",
    "this `` fluid '' has the property of behaving like dark matter at high density and like a cosmological constant at low density .",
    "the kinetic model introduced by scherrer @xcite can evolve into a fluid which describes at the same time the dark matter and cosmological constant components . in this case",
    ", perturbations do not show instabilities but , at early times , the fluid evolves like radiation , leading to a possible conflict with the constraints coming from primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , the parameters of the model have to be fine - tuned in order for the model not to exhibit finite pressure effects in the non - linear stages of structure formation @xcite .    in this paper we consider the general lagrangian of _ k - essence _ models and classify them through two variables connected to the fluid equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to find attractor solutions around which the scalar field is able to describe a mixture of dark matter and cosmological constant - like dark energy , an example being scherrer s @xcite purely kinetic model .",
    "next , we impose that the lagrangian of the scalar field is constant , i.e. that @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant , along suitable solutions of the equation of motion , and find a general class of k - essence models whose attractors directly describe a unified dark matter / dark energy fluid . while the simplest of such models , based on a neutral scalar field with canonical kinetic term , unavoidably leads to an effective speed of sound @xmath7 which equals the speed of light , thereby inhibiting the growth of matter perturbations , we find a more general class of non - canonical ( k - essence ) models which allow for the possibility that @xmath2 whenever matter dominates .",

    "<S> considering the general lagrangian of _ k - essence _ models , we study and classify them through variables connected to the fluid equation of state parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to find solutions around which the scalar field describes a mixture of dark matter and cosmological constant - like dark energy , an example being the purely kinetic model proposed by scherrer . making the stronger assumption that the scalar field lagrangian is exactly constant along solutions of the equation of motion </S>",
    "<S> , we find a general class of k - essence models whose classical trajectories directly describe a unified dark matter / dark energy ( cosmological constant ) fluid . while the simplest case of a scalar field with canonical kinetic term unavoidably leads to an effective sound speed @xmath1 , thereby inhibiting the growth of matter inhomogeneities , more general non - canonical k - essence models allow for the possibility that @xmath2 whenever matter dominates . </S>"
