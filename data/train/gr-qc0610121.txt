    "cosmology , mainly due to its modern astronomical observations , seems to have been limited to what is nowadays dubbed the cosmological concordance model ( ccm ) . in the observational cosmology",
    "this role is played by the cold dark matter model with the cosmological constant ( @xmath3cdm model ) .",
    "it offers the simplest explanation of the current universe filled with two components  dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "the former is in the form of non - relativistic dust matter contributing one third of the total energy density .",
    "the latter has negative pressure , violating the strong energy condition , and constitutes the remaining two thirds .",
    "interpretations of observational data within this model lead to the conclusion that we live in an accelerating universe which is almost spatially flat and low density @xcite .",
    "although the introduction of @xmath3 could be justified on purely geometrical ground , many authors seek a physical source of a suitably behaving matter , mimicking such a geometrical effect . in literature",
    "there are many cosmological models with dark energy which take part in the contest for the best description of the accelerating universe @xcite .    on the other hand , the very early universe , when classical physics is no longer sufficient , is not so well understood .",
    "it is believed that `` initial conditions '' for the classical evolution could be obtained from different , fundamental physics which dominates when the energy density is high enough , and which turn negligible as the universe expands . in other words ,",
    "new physics is welcome in the process of cosmological model building @xcite . in particular",
    ", one could hope for avoiding the initial singularity with a bounce of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "what we consider here are the effects of theories which predict a @xmath2-type modification to the friedmann equation , which fits the above description .",
    "although such reduction is a big simplification , we feel it is important to stress that such problems are explicitly solvable , which is often not checked before applying numerical studies in current works ; and that it is also possible to find and classify all types of evolutional scenarios which help to gain insight into more complicated models .",
    "below , we outline some recently significant possibilities of non - classical physics , and proceed to solve the resulting friedmann equation in the subsequent sections .",
    "the basic idea is that our observational universe is some four dimensional surface ( called a brane ) embedded in a more dimensional bulk spacetime , in which the gravitational field , but not the others , can freely propagate .",
    "the universe is self accelerating due to an additional term appearing in the friedmann equation when constrained to the brane ( for a pedagogical introduction into extra dimensions cosmology see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a higher dimensional cosmology in the randall - sundrum framework @xcite .",
    "then the friedmann equation assumes the following form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the four dimensional cosmological constant , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is an integration constant whose magnitude as well as sign depend on the initial conditions . the fifth term ( called dark radiation if @xmath8 ) we put equal to 0 because the third term is of the main interest in the present discussion .",
    "this @xmath2 contribution arises from the imposition of a junction condition for the scale factor of the brane .",
    "note that the @xmath2 term would decay as rapidly as @xmath9 in a matter dominated universe , thus modifying the early evolution and not being significant later on .",
    "both negative and positive @xmath10 are possible because @xmath10 corresponds to the metric signature of the extra dimension  @xcite . however , the sign of @xmath10 is crucial because models with timelike extra dimension can avoid initial singularity by the so called `` bounce '' @xcite .",
    "of course , the sign of @xmath10 remains an open question  in @xcite , the authors discuss some consequences of the choice @xmath11 .",
    "then , the presence of the @xmath2 term on the right - hand side of ( [ rs_friedmann ] ) leads a contracting universe to a bounce instead of a big bang type of curvature singularity ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "if that happens , we have a constraint on the value of brane tension @xmath14 because the bounce takes place at densities greater than during nucleosynthesis .",
    "it should also be added that string theory does not provide any reasons for an additional timelike dimension .",
    "it is , nevertheless , a mathematically viable possibility , that some authors choose to investigate .",
    "note that such modification was also recently investigated in the context of two - brane model @xcite , and such equations arise in classically constrained gravity of gabadadze and shang @xcite .",
    "the standard big bang cosmology presents us with the problem of initial conditions for the universe .",
    "what we can observe from `` the inside '' can not answer the question why particular conditions were chosen , as we are simply looking at the dynamics .",
    "unfortunately we can not look from `` the outside '' and risk any kind of statistical or other external explanation .",
    "many authors shift the problem to the planckian epoch , during which the quantum effects are important .",
    "a contraction phase preceding the present expansion , as predicted by some of these theories , seems to be one of the more attractive scenarios .",
    "it is very interesting that the geometric effects in loop quantum cosmology predict a @xmath15 modification to the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "this modification is relevant in the very early universe when its matter energy density becomes comparable with the planck density .",
    "the effective friedmann equation becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xcite , and one can distinguish classical and quantum bounces depending on the relative magnitude of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is an application of the lqg methods , where the spacetime is discrete on the quantum level , considerably affecting the large scale @xcite with nonperturbative corrections .",
    "the @xmath2 modification is shared with the braneworld model , and some comparison work can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this misleadingly dubbed concept does not in fact involve the abandonment of riemannian manifold structure , but the name has been widely used so far and we also adopt it here .",
    "the first non - riemannian cosmological models were based on the einstein - cartan theory , which is a modification of general relativity by adding the torsion of the space - time @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the effects of spin and torsion are manifested by the presence of an additional @xmath20 contribution in the friedmann equation .",
    "the main motivation for studying such models was the problem of the initial singularity which could be avoided due to the spin effects .    among various extensions of general relativity , the so called metric - affine gravity ( mag )",
    "is recently of interest .",
    "in contrast to the riemann - cartan theory , the connection is no longer metric which implies that the covariant derivative of the metric does not vanish . for a review see e.g.",
    "@xcite .",
    "this time , the friedmann equation reads @xmath21 where the new constant @xmath22 can be of both signs , and @xmath23 is an integration constant .",
    "therefore , the non - riemannian quantities of this model ( torsion and non - metricity ) will modify very early stages of evolution and are negligible at later times .",
    "we find different possible interpretations of the presence of the @xmath2 contribution in the friedmann equation .",
    "however , we must remember that cosmography which is based on the behaviour of the null geodesics maps the geometry and kinematics of the universe in terms of @xmath1 , without any reference to the source of each contribution .",
    "this happens because it measures only the average properties of the matter density , and eventually only the overall term @xmath24 is significant @xcite .",
    "interestingly , similar @xmath9 modifications have also been obtained in universes with varying constants @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the generic case , alpha varying models lead to a bouncing universe .",
    "we take the friedmann equation in the following form @xmath25 with a general @xmath2 term , and a new , real constant @xmath22 .",
    "as mentioned before , spatially flat space is assumed , although there exist curved models in which the dynamics is also solvable by means of elementary functions @xcite .",
    "we define a scale factor @xmath26 , so that it is equal to unity at time @xmath27 ( say , today ) , and accordingly , the scaling law for the ( dust ) matter density @xmath28 the main equation is now @xmath29 next , we introduce the density parameters @xmath30 @xmath31 which requires a change of the time variable @xmath32 so that the equation is simplified to a well known form @xmath33 with the condition binding the present values of densities @xmath34 note , that in our notation these @xmath30 s are all constants . finally , introducing a new dependent variable @xmath35 @xmath36{u(s)}\\ ] ] the right - hand side becomes a polynomial @xmath37 which can immediately be solved by the use of trigonometric functions only as @xmath38 +      ( \\omega_{\\lambda}-\\omega_{m,0}^2 + 4\\omega_{\\lambda}\\omega_q )      \\sinh[3\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\lambda}}(\\alpha\\pm s ) ]      }      { 4\\omega_{\\lambda}^{9/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the integration constant . obviously such a general solution is not very clear , the more so because @xmath39 is in general a complex number .",
    "that is why we simplify the main equation a bit more with another set of substitutions ( provided that @xmath40 ) @xmath41 and obtain @xmath42 or , if @xmath43 , @xmath44 upon using ( [ bind ] ) .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath3 , we have three main groups of solutions , which we proceed to describe in more detail .",
    "the curves described by equation  ( [ main ] ) in the plane @xmath46 are either two hyperbolae or straight lines , as shown in figure  ( [ hyper ] ) .",
    "if @xmath47 is negative , we have the hyperbolae situated above and below @xmath48 - they are really the same solution , only with the sign of time interchanged .",
    "the main equation always admits such a symmetry , but as we want a universe which is expanding at this moment , we choose the solution with @xmath49 .",
    "it is given by @xmath50 ,      \\label{sol_pos}\\ ] ] and shown in figure ( [ hyper_mon ] ) .",
    ", depending on the sign of @xmath47 . only the paths intersected by the @xmath51 line are admissible in a given set of the parameters .",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath52 .",
    "[ hyper],scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and @xmath53 solution .",
    "[ hyper_mon],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    when @xmath54 , we have the other two hyperbolae , but as @xmath55 and @xmath3 are both positive , @xmath56 is negative , and so only the right branch can intersect with the @xmath51 line . if @xmath57 , a bounce without singularity appears .",
    "the formula is the same as in ( [ sol_pos ] ) , and is shown in figure ( [ hyper_bounce ] ) .",
    "this is in fact the generic setup , as @xmath3 is usually assumed to be positive , and the @xmath2 contribution negative .",
    "this means that @xmath58 is negative , making @xmath59 positive .",
    "for this reason we consider bounce the generic feature here .     and @xmath54 solution .",
    "[ hyper_bounce],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    if @xmath60 , @xmath56 becomes a double root of the polynomial in the right - hand side of equation ( [ main ] ) and accordingly a possible static solution .",
    "however , it is negative in our physical setup , so the only possibility are the straight - line solutions .",
    "they are different in that they asymptotically evolve from the static solution in the infinite past , as can be seen in figure  ( [ hyper_asympt ] ) .",
    "formula  ( [ sol_pos ] ) still holds .     and @xmath60 solution .",
    "[ hyper_asympt],scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the situation is much simpler now , as shown in figure  ( [ circle ] )  the only possible curve is a circle when @xmath47 is positive .",
    "the condition ( [ bind ] ) means that the circle must intersect the @xmath51 line , unless @xmath60 , which corresponds to a stable , static solution .",
    "if @xmath62 is positive , the evolution is a singularity free oscillation .",
    "obviously only one formula is needed to describe this case @xmath63,\\ ] ] and a typical example is shown in figure ( [ circle_period ] ) .    .",
    "the circle always intersects the @xmath51 line , unless @xmath60 , and the solution reduces to the static one @xmath64 . @xmath52 .",
    "[ circle],scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and @xmath54 solution .",
    "[ circle_period],scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "finally , the simplest case with zero cosmological constant , where going back to equation ( [ zero_lambda ] ) .",
    "this time the solution is even simpler - polynomial in time @xmath65 where , as before , we determined the integration constants by assuming @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this is also a bounce , with a minimum size of @xmath68 which is only positive if @xmath69 , or equivalently @xmath70 , corresponding to a negative @xmath2 term in the friedmann equation .",
    "qualitatively the behaviour here is the same as that in figure ( [ hyper_bounce ] ) , only the expansion is not exponentially fast .",
    "we have studied the frw models with an additional @xmath0 term in the friedmann equation .",
    "astronomical measurements based on the relation @xmath1 and general dynamics of such models ignore the number and the particular type of contributions  as long as they scale the same way . among these",
    ", we described : brane theory , non - riemannian modifications and loop quantum cosmology . their combined effect ,",
    "as observed through the hubble s relation , could in theory be null , due to the indefiniteness of sign . which is not to say that they would be indistinguishable ( or null ) when other observations come into account .",
    "assuming the non - zero term @xmath9 , it is still possible to find exact solutions , and classify all possible evolutional paths .",
    "it was shown that exact solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary functions and depending on the sign of @xmath3 we have three main families ( with the exact formulas provided in the respective sections ) .    for @xmath43 ( section v )",
    "we obtain a simple algebraic solution which is a bounce , and for a negative @xmath2 contribution the minimal value of the scale factor is positive . qualitatively it is the same as the one presented in figure [ hyper_bounce ] .    when @xmath61 ( section iv ) , we have a periodic behaviour ( figure [ circle_period ] ) of the scale factor , but as above , the minima are not necessarily positive .",
    "finally , taking @xmath45 ( section iii ) , we obtain a universe which expand exponentially , but which could have followed three different paths in the past .",
    "it could have bounced ( figure [ hyper_bounce ] ) , it could have been expanding all the time from minus infinity ( figure [ hyper_mon ] ) or asymptotically from the static solution ( figure [ hyper_asympt ] ) .",
    "of course , the last two scenarios , would have to be considered as singular and expanding from the @xmath71 singularity .",
    "the generic feature seems to be the replacement of the initial singularity by a bounce .",
    "however , the effects might influence also the late evolution if one considers a phantom fluid , and are a possibility of avoiding the so called big rip singularity @xcite .    as mentioned before , similar exact solutions of the friedmann equation",
    "were found for brane scenarios by setare @xcite .",
    "such solutions are among the simplest possible , where the left hand side of the equation is a polynomial of degree 2 , or can be reduced to such a polynomial .",
    "usually this can be done by either introducing a new `` conformal '' time , or choosing a new scale factor which some power of @xmath72 . for polynomials of greater degrees such",
    "reduction is , in general , impossible and elliptic functions have to be used @xcite .",
