    "coherent states ( cs ) are an essential tool of modern physics . the original ( or  standard \" ) coherent states of a harmonic oscillator are quasi - classical wavepackets following closely the classical oscillating trajectories with minimal uncertainty in their position and momentum .",
    "mathematically , they are obtained by acting with a displacement operator @xmath4 on the ground state , with @xmath5 a complex number indexing the cs .",
    "this definition can be generalized to other systems , in particular if the hilbert space @xmath6 of the physical system under consideration is an irreducible representation space for a particular lie group @xmath7 indexed by a continuous label @xmath8 .",
    "following @xcite , generalized cs are then obtained by acting with all elements of the group on some reference state @xmath9 in @xmath6 .",
    "the operators @xmath10 generalize the displacement operators introduced above .",
    "the group structure ensures that the family of generalized cs generated in this way is closed .",
    "when the group is @xmath11 and the representation space the fock space with @xmath2 particles in two modes ( which describes , for instance , an ensemble of @xmath2 two - level atoms or spin @xmath12 particles ) , this construction leads to the well - known @xmath11 cs , sometimes simply called `` spin coherent states '' .",
    "spin cs are used extensively in fields as diverse as quantum optics @xcite or magnetism @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can introduce @xmath0 cs to describe the collective state of @xmath2 three - level atoms @xcite or spin 1 lattice models of magnetic materials ( _ e_.g .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this article , we apply the @xmath0 cs formalism to the study of the equilibrium properties of a spin @xmath13 bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature , where the three modes are the three zeeman states with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath14 along a given quantization axis @xmath15 .",
    "we assume the validity of the single - mode approximation ( sma ) , which considers that all atoms condense in the same spatial mode @xcite . within the sma ,",
    "the resulting formalism allows one to describe an arbitrary collective spin state of @xmath2 bosons in the same spatial mode , and is sufficiently simple to yield explicit analytic predictions that can be used to analyze experimental results .",
    "we discuss in detail the expected thermal equilibrium for the situation of current experimental relevance , where @xmath2 is large and where the magnetization of the system is conserved @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the method by calculating the first moments of the @xmath16 population as well as its probability density function in various cases of experimental interest . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17",
    ", the theory reduces to the usual mean - field treatment @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 is large but finite ( as in typical experiments , where @xmath3 ) , we find that fluctuations of the collective spin can be pronounced and experimentally observable .",
    "in order to establish notations , we start by considering a single spin 1 particle . an arbitrary pure state @xmath18 can be obtained by applying a @xmath0 transformation @xmath19 to the maximally polarized state .",
    "we find convenient to express @xmath20 as @xmath21 the global phase is chosen such that the @xmath16 component is real .",
    "physically , @xmath22 $ ] corresponds to the reduced population in @xmath16 and @xmath23 $ ] to the reduced longitudinal magnetization , both normalized to the total particle number ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have also introduced two relative phases , @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 the argument of the component @xmath28 .",
    "the phase @xmath29 can be related to the orientation in the @xmath30 plane of the average transverse spin vector @xmath31 , and the phase @xmath32 to the magnitude of @xmath33 , @xmath34    we now turn to the case of @xmath2 bosons .",
    "the fock space for @xmath2 bosons with three possible internal states remains a representation space for @xmath0 , and we can generate a family of states @xmath35 by a @xmath0 transformation acting on the maximally polarized state @xmath36 @xcite . the states @xmath37 , explicitly given by @xmath38 in second quantized notation , describe an ensemble of @xmath2 bosons condensing simultaneously in the same spin state @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is a vector notation for the annihilation operators in each zeeman substate , and @xmath41 is the vacuum state .",
    "the @xmath0 cs @xmath37 are generalized cs in the sense described in the introduction .",
    "they provide a resolution of the identity operator @xcite , @xmath42 , with the measure @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 cs form a basis of fock space , which is overcomplete since cs are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "operators acting in fock space can be represented as diagonal operators in the cs basis @xcite .",
    "the main interest of using the basis of coherent states is the simplicity of the resulting theory in the large @xmath2 limit , as discussed in details by yaffe @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion focusing on bose - einstein condensates ) . in this limit ,",
    "the scalar product @xmath45 becomes very peaked around @xmath46 due to the large @xmath2 power .",
    "this allows one to perform the approximation @xmath47 with @xmath48 a normalization coefficient .",
    "the function @xmath49 is normalized to unity with the measure @xmath50 and vanishes very quickly ( on a typical scale @xmath51 in each generalized coordinate ) when @xmath52 moves away from @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", @xmath49 tends to a dirac distribution @xmath54 when @xmath17 .",
    "the normalization of the cs implies the relation @xmath55 ^ 2=1 $ ] , which can be used to evaluate the normalization coefficient .    in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "the quasi - orthogonality between two cs expressed in eq.([eq : scalarprod ] ) greatly simplifies the computation of expectation values . in the cs states basis ,",
    "a @xmath56body normally ordered operator @xmath57 with @xmath58 can be approximated as @xmath59 as a result , the expectation value in a cs of a product of two ( few - body ) operators obeys a simple rule , @xmath60 .",
    "this property allows one to compute thermodynamic averages in a thermal state described by a density operator @xmath61 using the intuitively appealing formula , @xmath62 effectively , @xmath63 plays the role of a classical distribution function in @xmath53 space . for the canonical ensemble , for instance",
    ", we have @xmath64 with @xmath65 the partition function and with @xmath66 the inverse temperature .    in this article , we consider particle numbers @xmath2 which are large but finite , so that the orthogonality relation between two coherent states holds only approximately . in the following ,",
    "we use systematically the large @xmath2 limit , which should thus be understood as the dominant power of @xmath2 in a @xmath67 expansion .",
    "we now apply this formalism to the description of the low temperature properties of a trapped gas of ultracold spin 1 bosons . as indicated in the introduction , we assume that all atoms occupy the same spatial mode @xmath68 ( but not necessarily the same spin state ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the spin dynamics is then @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the spin interaction energy per atom , @xmath71 is the quadratic zeeman energy , @xmath72 is the total spin operator , and @xmath73 is the number operator for the zeeman state @xmath74 .    in most experiments with spinor gases ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the system is prepared with a prior distribution that depends on the particular experimental sequence , noted @xmath75 ( @xmath76 being the eigenvalues of @xmath77 ) .",
    "typically , @xmath75 is peaked around the average value @xmath78 . because @xmath77 commutes with the interaction hamiltonian",
    ", the prior distribution is essentially preserved by binary collisions driving the gas towards kinetic equilibrium . in order to account for the experimental situation",
    ", we use a generalized statistical ensemble , where the energy and the populations @xmath75 are conserved on average . maximizing the entropy following the standard gibbs procedure leads to the density matrix @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the projector on the subspace @xmath76 and where the @xmath81 s are lagrange multipliers introduced to enforce the conservation of the probabilities @xmath82 .",
    "although this procedure would be the most rigorous one , it leads to a rather complicated formalism , where @xmath2 constants of motion are required to describe the ensemble . instead of constraining the full distribution , we choose in the following to constrain only the first two moments @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we expect that the differences from the more rigorous formalism will not be significant as long as only few - body observables are computed .",
    "constraining the first two moments of @xmath1 leads to a density matrix @xmath85 where @xmath86 are two lagrange multipliers .    in the large @xmath2 limit , the partition function is determined by the free energy @xmath87 .",
    "using eqs.([eq : sperp],[eq : h ] ) and the properties of cs , we rewrite @xmath88 as @xmath89 we have introduced two dimensionless parameters @xmath90 as well as two new lagrange multipliers @xmath91 and @xmath92 determined by the two constraints @xmath93 and @xmath94 . the parameter @xmath95 is approximately equal to the average magnetization ( but not exactly , unless @xmath96 ) . in the natural energy unit of @xmath97 , the parameter @xmath98 can be interpreted as the inverse of a longitudinal pseudo - temperature characterizing the fluctuations of @xmath77 in the prior distribution defining our generalized ensemble . in comparison ,",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath99 characterizes the fluctuations of the transverse components @xmath100 .",
    "a purely thermal prior distribution of @xmath1 is characterized by @xmath101 , a narrow prior distribution by @xmath102 and a broad one by @xmath103 .",
    "the two dimensionless parameters @xmath104 and @xmath99 allow us to specify the thermodynamic state completely given the two constraints on @xmath83 and @xmath105 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath104 and @xmath99 are both proportional to the total atom number @xmath2 , which reflects the fact that we are dealing with fluctuations of a collective variable .    in principle",
    ", the set of equations above can be used to characterize the collective thermodynamic state for any values of the parameters , @xmath106 . in the following",
    ", we will illustrate the usefulness of the @xmath0 cs approach in particular regimes , where analytical results can be obtained : the mean field regime ( where differences from the @xmath107 mean field theory are small ) , the regime of small @xmath108 for antiferromagnetic interactions , and the regime of strong spin fluctuations when @xmath96 . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the experimentally relevant case where the distribution of @xmath1 fulfills @xmath109 ( @xmath83 can be chosen arbitrarily ) . to reduce the number of varying parameters",

    "( so that @xmath99 is constant ) .",
    "we vary the quadratic zeeman energy ( or equivalently @xmath104 ) and the average magnetization .",
    "the thermodynamics is controlled by the behavior of the free energy @xmath88 . for all choices of the parameters",

    "the atoms condense in that minimum @xcite , which determines the phase diagram @xcite . for @xmath113 ( ferromagnetic interactions ) ,",
    "the minimum is obtained for @xmath114 and a certain value @xmath115 which maximizes the magnitude of the transverse spin . for @xmath116 ( antiferromagnetic interactions ) ,",
    "the minimum is obtained for @xmath117 and the value @xmath118 which minimizes @xmath119 . differently from the ferromagnetic case , @xmath118 is zero until a critical value @xmath120 above which it becomes positive .",
    "one normally expects that for sufficiently low temperatures , the system only explores the vicinity of the minimum .",
    "the free energy then equals its value @xmath121 at the minimum plus small additional terms , corresponding to gaussian fluctuations around the minimum with a typical spread @xmath122 ( up to coefficients depending on @xmath123 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "this describes well the case of ferromagnetic systems , where the finite @xmath110 solution is always close to the zero temperature one as shown in figure  [ fig : results_ferro_constrained ] .",
    "the small differences are due to the combined effects of fluctuations and of the spread of @xmath1 , which are included in the finite @xmath110 calculation but not in the @xmath107 one .",
