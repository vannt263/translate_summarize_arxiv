    "in conventional superconductors ( s ) , pairing occurs between electrons with opposite spins , and thus , the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism may lead to a variety of interesting effects in superconducting and proximity structures .",

    "the potential impurities are supposed to be sufficiently strong to bring the electronic motion to the diffusive regime . on top of this diffusive motion ,",

    "we further assume that this magnetic disorder is much weaker than the potential one , in terms of the characteristic scattering rates",

    "therefore we expect that the same form of the spin - flip term remains valid also near the minigap edge .",
    "the problem with the perturbative expansion at the minigap edge is due to the fact that the minigap itself depends on the spin - flip rate,@xcite which leads to a non - analytic shift of the saddle point of the action ( [ action - full ] ) as a function of the disorder @xmath145 . a correct way to include",

    "we have obtained exact expressions for the effective spin - flip rate , under the assumption of a gaussian magnetic disorder .",
    "while the exact expressions for the effective spin - flip rate are probably of mainly academic interest , we believe that our results will be helpful for estimating the spin - flip effects induced by inhomogeneities in various experimental setups . as an example of such an application , we consider the experiments on sfs @xmath0-junctions , where the spin flip plays an important role@xcite ( it manifests itself in the difference between the length scales involved in the decay and oscillations of the critical current as a function of the junction thickness ) .",

    "note that this correlation scale is of the order of the length scales associated with the uniform component @xmath137 of the magnetic field and with the resulting spin - flip rate , thus , this example is at the borderline of applicability of our theory .",
    "the estimated size of inhomogeneities is apparently too small for domains ( in recent experiments on cuni films similar to those used in the @xmath0-junctions , domains of size about 100  nm have been reported@xcite ) .",
    "however , our estimates are consistent with earlier indications of clusters of magnetic ni atoms in such alloys@xcite ( inhomogeneities inside the domains ) .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on comparison between the effective spin - flip rates due to two cases of inhomogeneous magnetization : disordered and periodic ones .",
    "the disordered case is considered in the present paper , while specific realizations of periodic magnetic structures were studied before in refs .  .",
    "the obtained results for the spin - flip rate are all of the same order of magnitude , differing only by numerical factors .",
