    "the knowledge of the precise value of the @xmath4 coupling is a crucial issue : not only in nuclear physics where it is a fundamental constant , but also in particle physics where it is of great importance for the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "its experimental error is the main obstacle in the accurate testing of the corrections to the goldberger - treiman relation as predicted from chiral symmetry breaking . with the latest value for the axial coupling constant , @xmath5  @xcite",
    ", this relation would lead to @xmath6 , if it were exact , which is not expected .",
    "the uncertainty , here of about @xmath7 , comes from the experimental error in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if we know how to calculate the corrections perfectly we can clearly make good use of a precision of 1% in @xmath10 .    in the 1980 s ,",
    "the @xmath0 coupling constant was believed to be well known .",
    "koch and pietarinen  @xcite determined a value of the charged pion coupling constant , @xmath11 , from @xmath12 scattering data .",
    "kroll  @xcite found the neutral pion coupling constant to be @xmath13 , analysing @xmath14 data with forward dispersion relations . in the early 1990 s the nijmegen group  @xcite determined smaller values on the basis of energy - dependent partial - wave analyses ( pwa ) of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) scattering data .",
    "they obtained @xmath16 and@xmath17 .",
    "similar values around @xmath18 , have also been found by the virginia tech group  @xcite from analysis of both @xmath19 and @xmath15 data .",
    "these results have stimulated an intense debate , and it has become urgent to determine @xmath10 to high precision , convincingly and model - independently  @xcite .    in the analysis by the nijmegen group  @xcite the determination of the coupling",
    "constant seems not to be very sensitive to the backward @xmath1 cross section . in our work at 162  mev  @xcite",
    ", we have shown the contrary using ` pseudodata ' built from models in common use , including the nijmegen potential  @xcite .",
    "the experimental normalization of the cross section is crucial and this has been a well known problem in the past .",
    "most energy - dependent pwa s have therefore chosen to let the normalization of data float more or less freely .",
    "the direct sensitivity to the @xmath1 cross section is then lost , and the coupling constant can depend diffusely on many observables .",
    "we believe that precision data of the backward @xmath1 cross section should be one of the best places in the @xmath15 sector to determine the charged coupling constant .",
    "we have demonstrated recently  @xcite , that it is both the _ shape _ of the angular distribution at the most backward angles , and the _ absolute normalization _ of the data , that are of decisive importance in this context . before analysing the new 162 mev data we shall illustrate the possible consequences of the relativly large spread of the values of the @xmath4 coupling constant on the quark mass ratio @xmath20 .",
    "we shall then describe the extrapolation to the pion pole and give some conclusions .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the dashen - weinstein sum rule  @xcite for deviations from the goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation allows a possible determination of @xmath21 .",
    "this sum rule is obtained by considering the matrix elements of the non - strange charged axial vector current at @xmath22 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the strange ones between @xmath24 and @xmath25 and between @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "the hypothesis of partial conservation of the current leads at @xmath22 to equations between the deviations of the gt relations , the @xmath4 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 couplings , the axial form factors and the pseudoscalar meson decay constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "expanding matrix elements of the pseudoscalar densities in terms of the quark masses and using the @xmath31 symmetry invariance in the chiral limit , lead then to the sum rule .",
    "it expresses the ratio @xmath21 in terms of experimental quantities .",
    "so far one knows only an upper limit of 7 for the @xmath28 coupling . from the present knowledge for the other constants ,",
    "the sum rule leads then to a maximum value of @xmath21 as a function of the @xmath4 coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "some corresponding numbers are summarized in table  [ tab : sumrule ] . if our previously obtained high value of @xmath32  @xcite is confirmed , then a value of @xmath21 of 25 , as required by a large value of quark condensate , will be excluded .",
    "however , lower @xmath32 allow this value .",
    "these conclusions are dependent on the precise experimental determination not only of the @xmath4 couplings but also of the @xmath33 and @xmath28 couplings . on the theoretical side , the evaluation of corrections of the order of @xmath34 , to the sum rule , should also be performed .",

    "it is very striking that the @xmath1 unpolarized charge exchange cross sections in a very large range of energies from about 100 mev to several gev , have similar shape and normalization ( in the laboratory system ) .",
    "these data contain essentially the same physical information as far as the extrapolation to the pion pole is concerned .",
    "here we shall concentrate our analysis to new precise data at 162 mev  @xcite consisting of an extension from @xmath36 to @xmath37 of our previous backward measurement  @xcite .",
    "this allows to improve the absolute normalization to about @xmath38 .",
    "a study of the present @xmath1 data base  @xcite , shows that there are two main families with respect to the angular shape .",
    "the first one is dominated by the bonner _",
    "data  @xcite , which have a flattish angular distribution at backward angles .",

    "we have chosen the regularized pion born amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite with the r - space @xmath46-function subtracted .",
    "this ensures a non - zero cross section at @xmath47 . the different components for this born pion terms , and for the more realistic paris potential",
    ", are then displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : ope]a and [ fig : ope]b , respectively .",
    "the combination @xmath48 , which contains the entire pion pole term , is for the paris potential remarkably close to that of the born term , particularly at small @xmath45 .",
    "the term @xmath49 is very small in both cases and the more important @xmath50 terms are again very similar",
    ". the simple structure of the term which contains the pion pole gives considerable confidence that the extrapolation can be achieved realistically .",
    "the basic idea to extrapolate to the pion pole is to construct a smooth physical function , the chew function  @xcite ,    @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the square of the total energy and @xmath53 . at the pion pole @xmath54 , the chew function gives @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the pseudoscalar coupling constant related to the pseudovector coupling by @xmath57 .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 is a reference scale for the coupling chosen for convenience .",
    "the model - independent extrapolation requires accurate data with absolute normalization of the differential cross section .",
    "if the differential cross section is incorrectly normalized by a factor @xmath59 , the extrapolation determines @xmath60 .",
    "the difference method , which we introduced to obtain a substantial improvement  @xcite , is based on the chew function , but it recognizes that a major part in the cross section behaviour is described by models with exactly known values for the coupling constant .",
    "it applies the chew method to the _ difference _ between the function @xmath61 obtained from a model and from the experimental data , i.e. , @xmath62 with @xmath63 of eq .",
    "[ eq : chew ] replaced by the model value @xmath64 . at the pole @xmath65 .",
    "this should diminish systematic extrapolation errors and remove a substantial part of the irrelevant information at large momentum transfers .    in our work",
    "we have explicitly shown , using ` pseudodata ' generated from models in common use including the nijmegen potential  @xcite , that we can reproduce the input coupling constants of the models to a precision less than 1% .",
    "we have grouped the data into a `` reduced range '' , @xmath66 with 31 data points and a `` full range '' , @xmath67 with 54 data points .",
    "the reduced range is the range of the data available for the analysis in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "this allows to check the sensitivity and stability of the extrapolation to a particular cut in momentum transfer and to verify that it is the small @xmath45 region that carries most of the pion pole information .",
    "the difference method requires only a few terms in the polynomial expansion in favorable cases , and this gives a small , statistical extrapolation error .",
    "the similarity between the angular distributions from models and the experimental data is exploited , particularly for large @xmath45 .",
    "this incorporates substantial additional physical information without introducing any model dependence .",
    "we apply the method using three comparison models : the nijmegen potential  @xcite , the nijmegen energy - dependent pwa ni93  @xcite as well as the virginia sm95 energy - dependent pwa  @xcite .",
    "the result , for this last case , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] for the reduced and full ranges of data . in all cases",
    "the extrapolation to the pole can be made easily and already a visual extrapolation gives a good result .",
    "the polynomial fits cause no problem as long as the data are not overparametrized .",
    "the resulting @xmath68 is consistent with our previous finding  @xcite .",
    "subsequent to our first publication  @xcite arndt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite subjected a major part of the @xmath1 charge exchange cross section data to an analysis using the difference method at energies from 0.1 to 1 gev .",
    "they found an average value 13.75 using sm95 as comparison model .",
    "their individual results show a considerable scatter of approximately @xmath69 .",
    "this appears to come from the quality of the data . in particular , the deduced @xmath10 shows systematic trends with energy as can be seen in fig .  3 for the bonner data leading to an increase of @xmath10 with energy .",
    "note that for energies above 400 mev the slope of the data at large angle is as steep as that of the uppsala data .",
    "we have seen that there exists a spread of 7 % for the value of the @xmath4 coupling constant which can have important consequences on our present understanding of qcd .",
    "here we have shown that using the most accurate extrapolation method , the difference method , on high precision @xmath1 differential cross section measurements at 162  mev in the angular range @xmath70 one can obtain a precise value of this coupling , namely @xmath71 with a systematic error of about @xmath72 and a normalization uncertainty of @xmath73 .",
    "we have no difficulty in reproducing the input coupling constants of models using equivalent pseudo - data .",
    "the practical usefulness of the method , its precision and its relative insensitivity to systematics appear to be in hand without serious problems .",
    "the data were normalized using the total @xmath1 cross section , which is one of the most accurately known cross sections in nuclear physics , together with a novel approach , in which the differential cross section measurement was considered as a simultaneous measurement of a fraction of the total cross section .",
    "it was found that , in the angular region @xmath2 , our data are steeper than those of the large data set of bonner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite below about 400  mev .",
    "this steeper behaviour , leading to a high value of @xmath10 , should be confirmed and a dedicated @xmath1 charge exchange precision experiment at 200 mev with a tagged neutron , to allow an absolute measurement , is going to be performed at iucf .",
