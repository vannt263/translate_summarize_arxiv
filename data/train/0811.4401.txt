    "collision experiments of heavy nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( bnl ) , the large hadron collider ( cern ) and future experiments at the fair facility ( gsi ) involve far - from - equilibrium dynamics for strongly interacting matter described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "available data from rhic reveals remarkable , unexpected properties such as rapid apparent thermalization with robust collective phenomena .",
    "there seems to be a good description of a wide range of data using hydrodynamical models with near - perfect fluidity , provided one assumes that suitable initial conditions form in about @xmath0@xmath1 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "the explanation of these findings from qcd provides a challenge for theory .",
    "strong interactions can play an important role for qcd at accessible energies . however , there are theoretical indications that essential nonequilibrium dynamics could affect the picture dramatically .",
    "complete local thermal equilibrium may not be necessary for the application of hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently high energy densities nonequilibrium instabilities in anisotropic plasmas have been identified as the parametrically fastest processes , which may help to explain a rapid isotropization of the equation of state relevant for near - perfect fluid descriptions  @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium instabilities may also play an important role for the process of thermalization in the early universe after inflation  @xcite . in inflationary cosmology ,",
    "the universe at early times expands quasi - exponentially in a vacuum - like state . during this stage of inflation , all",
    "energy is contained in a slowly evolving inflaton field .",
    "eventually the inflaton field decays and transfers all of its energy to particles , thereby starting the thermal history of the hot friedmann cosmology . in chaotic inflationary models for a wide range of couplings",
    "the particle production from a coherently oscillating inflaton occurs in the nonperturbative regime of a parametric - resonance instability .",
    "this picture , with variation in its details , extends to other inflationary models .",
    "though heavy - ion collisions and inflationary cosmology involve energy scales many orders of magnitude apart , their description requires similar quantum field theoretical techniques and certain universal aspects can even quantitatively agree .",
    "instabilities lead to exponential growth of occupation numbers in long wavelength modes on time scales much shorter than the asymptotic thermal equilibration time .",
    "though the underlying mechanisms are very different for qcd and for scalar inflaton dynamics , the subsequent evolution after an instability follows similar patterns : after a fast initial period of exponential growth the dynamics slows down considerably .",
    "the system is still far from equilibrium at this stage and the subsequent slow evolution is characterized by power - law distributions . a new class of infrared scaling solutions , where a characteristic large correlation length leads to independence of long - distance properties from details of the underlying microscopic theory ,",
    "has recently been found in the context of early - universe reheating dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the signatures can be dramatic .",
    "nonthermal scaling solutions can exhibit strongly enhanced low - momentum fluctuations @xmath2 , as compared to a thermal high - temperature distribution @xmath3 .",
    "this long - distance behavior is distinct from scaling associated to ( weak ) turbulence , such as @xmath4 , which is relevant for characteristic properties at shorter distances  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the same high - momentum scaling exponents known from inflaton dynamics have recently also been found to describe gluonic properties within lattice qcd in the classical - statistical gauge theory limit  @xcite .",
    "research concerning quantitative agreements of far - from - equilibrium properties in heavy - ion collision experiments and early universe dynamics is still in its infancies .",
    "this article highlights some known aspects and important open questions .",
    "a wide range of experimental rhic data , including elliptic flow measurements for momenta of less than about @xmath5-@xmath1 gev , can be described using hydrodynamical models with near - perfect fluidity  @xcite .",
    "the essential assumption of ideal hydrodynamic descriptions is the presence of an almost constant equation of state @xmath6 , which relates energy density @xmath7 to pressure @xmath8 given by a nearly diagonal stress tensor @xmath9 in the local fluid rest frame .",
    "this is needed to close the system of equations obtained from the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "relation ( [ eq : isotropy ] ) is true for isotropic systems if typical relativistic excitations have random directions , even if their energy distribution is far from thermal .",
    "let `` @xmath10 '' denote the characteristic momentum of typical excitations out of equilibrium , which may be identified with the saturation scale @xmath11 at time @xmath12 in the saturation scenario  @xcite .",
    "the relevant dephasing time which is required to obtain an almost constant or `` prethermalized '' equation of state for isotropic systems is @xmath13  @xcite . for sufficiently weakly coupled theories",
    "this time scale is much faster than the inverse relaxation rate of arbitrarily small departures from equilibrium given by @xmath14 which is associated to large - angle scattering or near - collinear splitting processes among quarks and gluons in qcd with gauge coupling @xmath15  @xcite . for anisotropic systems",
    "this relaxation time would characterize the time for isotropization in the absence of nonequilibrium instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , in qcd nonabelian weibel instabilities can drive local isotropization on a time scale , which is faster than ordinary perturbative scattering processes  @xcite . for sufficiently weak coupling and order - one anisotropy",
    "the inverse instability growth rate @xmath16 is parametrically faster than the inverse relaxation rate ( [ eq : trelax ] )  @xcite .",
    "consequently , understanding when a hydrodynamic description can first provide a good approximation is the same question as understanding the fastest characteristic process driving isotropization .",
    "most quantitative estimates of these processes rely on a separation of scales between suitably defined soft and hard momenta for sufficiently small characteristic running gauge coupling  @xcite . in this case",
    "the gluon degrees of freedom are described as classical fields for soft and classical particles for hard scales .",
    "the respective hard - loop effective theory of soft excitations is a nonabelian version of the linearized vlasov equations of traditional plasma physics , which are based on collisionless kinetic theory for hard particles coupled to a soft classical field .",
    "this approach neglects quantum corrections and may also be considered as an approximation of the classical - statistical field theory limit of the respective quantum gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "classical - statistical lattice gauge theory provides a quantitative description in the presence of sufficiently large energy density or occupation numbers per mode .",
    "the simulations are done by numerical integration of the classical lattice equations of motion and monte carlo sampling of initial conditions . in the following we concentrate on classical - statistical lattice gauge theory simulations of ref .",
    "the different approximations agree to a large extent in their predictions for characteristic growth rates at early times .",
    "they apparently disagree , in particular , concerning subsequent evolutions to turbulent flow which is described below .",
    "collisions of heavy nuclei leave behind a plasma of quarks and mostly gluons in a nearly flat region of space because of lorentz contraction along the beam- or @xmath17-axis .",
    "if the quarks and gluons stream freely into the surrounding space , then the distribution of particles would become locally highly anisotropic . in this case",
    "the stress tensor quickly acquires an oblate form with @xmath18 .",
    "the fastest growing mode of plasma instabilities then has its wavevector along the normal direction and generates a prolate contribution to the stress , which pushes the system towards greater isotropy .",
    "theoretical discussions of thermalization typically start from the saturation picture of high - energy heavy - ion collisions , where there is initially a nonperturbatively large phase - space density @xmath19 of gluons with momentum of order the saturation scale @xmath11  @xcite .",
