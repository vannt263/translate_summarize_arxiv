    "a wireless relay network is one in which a set of relay nodes assist a source node transmit information to a destination node . practically the wireless nodes can only support half - duplex communication @xcite , i.e. , no nodes can receive and transmit information simultaneously on the same frequency band . different cooperative transmission schemes for systems with half - duplex nodes have been proposed in the literature .",
    "fundamentally , these schemes consist of two basic steps .",
    "first , the source transmits to the destination , and the relay listens and `` captures '' @xcite the transmission from the source at the same time .",
    "next , the relays send processed source information to the destination while the source may still transmit to the destination directly .",
    "variants of these techniques have been proposed and have been shown to yield good performance under different circumstances @xcite .    assuming channel state information ( csi ) at the nodes , an opportunistic decode - and - forward ( df ) protocol for half - duplex relay channels is proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present routing algorithms to optimize the rate from a source to a destination , based on the df technique that uses regular block markov encoding and windowed decoding @xcite , for the gaussian full - duplex multiple - relay channel",
    ". the achievable rate of @xcite for the gaussian physically degraded full - duplex multi - relay channel has been established as the capacity of this channel in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the cut - set bound on the capacity of the gaussian single source - multiple relay - single destination mesh network can be achieved using the compress - and - forward ( cf ) method , as the relay powers go to infinity .",
    "some simpler cooperative diversity methods based on network path selection have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "these selection methods include : ( i ) the max - min selection method @xcite , wherein the relay node with the maximum of the minimum of the source - relay and relay - destination channel gains is selected ; ( ii ) the harmonic mean selection method @xcite , wherein the relay node with the highest harmonic mean of the source - relay and relay - destination channel gains is selected ; and ( iii ) the selection scheme of @xcite , in which the relay that can correctly decode the information from the source and has the best relay - destination channel is selected .",
    "these methods achieve a dmt of @xmath0 for an @xmath1 node relay network and multiplexing gain @xmath2 .",
    "this is close to what the distributed space - time coding protocol @xcite achieves , when @xmath1 is large .",
    "unfortunately , these network selection protocols perform poorly in high - rate scenarios ( @xmath3 ) .    we have proposed a cooperative diversity design based on a flow optimization approach for a three - node network in @xcite . in this design , the source node broadcasts two distinct flows to the destination and the relay node respectively during the relay s listen period .",
    "then the relay forwards this information using the df approach while the source may also send another flow of information to the destination during the relay s transmit period .",
    "this scheme is shown to achieve the optimal diversity order for the three - node relay channel and yield performance very close to optimal full - duplex relaying in both low- and high - rate situations .    here",
    ", we apply this cooperative transmission design to a general relay network , wherein wireless links are present between each pair of nodes in the network . as in @xcite , assuming csi is available at all nodes we use broadcasting ( bc ) , multiple access ( ma ) and time sharing ( ts ) techniques to formulate a flow theoretic convex optimization problem based on the channel conditions . instead of considering a total power constraint for all the transmitting nodes as in  @xcite , we subject each node to a maximum transmit power constraint .",
    "this yields a more reasonable system model for a general wireless relay network , especially when the number of nodes in the relay network is large .",
    "the resulting relaying protocol will be referred to as the flow - optimized ( fo ) protocol . to obtain a more practical cooperative design we develop a generalized - link selection ( gls ) protocol , in which we select the best relay node out of the available ones to form an equivalent three - node relay network to transmit the information from the source to the destination .",
    "the benefit of this , over other network path selection strategies , becomes evident when the rate requirement is high .",
    "it is shown that the simple gls protocol is optimal in terms of the dmt @xcite and yields acceptable performance even when the rate requirement is high .",
    "recently , in  @xcite , the authors have shown that compress - and - forward ( cf ) relaying achieves the optimal dmt for the three - node , half - duplex network , and that df relaying can achieve the optimal dmt of the four - node full - duplex network . in this work ,",
    "we show that the optimal dmt can be achieved for a general @xmath1-node ( @xmath4 ) half - duplex network using the fo or gls protocols . here",
    ", it should be clarified that we consider that the wireless links between each node - pair experience independent rayleigh fading , and this corresponds to the definition of _ non - clustered _ networks in  @xcite .",
    "the performances of the fo and gls protocols are evaluated numerically in terms of their outage probabilities for four- and five - node relay networks for uniform and non - uniform average power gains .",
    "the numerical results motivate the use of the gls protocol for situations where computation complexity is an issue and show a remarkable improvement over the max - min selection method of @xcite .",
    "the proposed designs , based on bc and ma alone , are sub - optimal in general . for a fair appraisal of the proposed protocols ,",
    "we compare the proposed protocols to an upper bound on the maximum rate , derived using the max - flow - min - cut theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.10.1 ) .",
    "we consider an @xmath1-node wireless relay network with a link joining each pair of nodes .",
    "each such wireless link is described by a bandpass gaussian channel with bandwidth @xmath5 and one - sided noise spectral density @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the power gain of the link from node @xmath7 to node @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "the link power gains are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) exponential random variables with unit mean .",
    "this corresponds to the case of independent rayleigh fading channels with unit average power gains .",
    "moreover , we assume that each node has a maximum power limit of @xmath10 and can only support half - duplex transmission .",
    "note that this model can be easily generalized to the case where channels may have non - uniform average power gains ( for which numerical examples are presented in section  [ sec : num_ex ] ) , and where different nodes may have different maximum power constraints . more specifically , the latter case can be converted into the uniform maximum power constraints case by absorbing the non - uniformity in the transmit powers into the average power gains of the corresponding links . in the sequel , we characterize the system in terms of the transmit signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , @xmath11 , at the input of the links .",
    "time is divided into unit intervals , and bc and ma are applied with a ts strategy that is optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency ( which we call `` rate '' hereafter for convenience ) . to avoid interference between concurrent transmissions",
    ", a time interval is divided into slots :    * during the first slot , the source may bc to all the other nodes in the network .",
    "* during the subsequent slots , a relay may bc to all other nodes ( except the source node ) , or it may receive flows from all other nodes ( except from the destination ) through ma . * during the very last slot , the source and the relays may send information flows to the destination using ma .    note that the forwarding of information by the relays is based on the df approach . for practicality consideration , it is assumed that the phases of the simultaneously transmitted signals from different nodes are not synchronized . in general , for the above transmission protocol , there would be a maximum of @xmath12 time slots of lengths @xmath13 respectively .",
    "next , we describe the optimization problem using a graph - theoretic formulation . define a graph @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the set of nodes , @xmath16 is the set of all links joining the nodes in the graph , and associate the vector @xmath17 to represent the flow rates associated with each link in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the number of elements in @xmath17 equals the cardinality of @xmath16 . for convenience ,",
    "we write @xmath18 .",
    "now denote the source by @xmath19 , the destination by @xmath20 , and the relay nodes by @xmath21 .",
    "the slotting of a unit time interval , as described above , yields simpler graphs for each time slot , that we call _ basic graphs_. a basic graph is either one in which a particular node may bc to several nodes , or in which several nodes transmit via ma to a particular node .",
    "thus for a basic graph , we need to include only the links between the nodes that may participate during the concerned time slot .",
    "for example , assume that the relay @xmath22 broadcasts to all nodes other than the source , during the @xmath7-th time slot . the basic graph is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the flow from node @xmath26 to node @xmath27 during the @xmath7-th time slot .",
    "in general , the proposed design involves ts between the basic graphs to yield the following equivalent graph @xmath28 corresponding to a unit interval ( see @xcite for a similar idea ) : @xmath29 where the number of elements in each vector @xmath30 is extended to @xmath31 by inserting zeros appropriately . the second equality in ( [ eqn : g_equiv ] )",
    "implies that @xmath28 can be viewed as a linear combination of the basic graphs @xmath32s , with the equivalent set of edges given by the union of the sets @xmath33 , and the equivalent flow rate vector given by the linear combination of the individual flow rate vectors @xmath30 . to maximize the data rate from the source to the destination through the relay network , we need to consider each cut that partitions @xmath15 into sets @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , there can be @xmath38 such possible cuts for the @xmath1-node relay network .",
    "let these cuts and the corresponding cut sets be denoted by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively , for @xmath42 .",
    "further , for the graph @xmath28 , for any two nodes @xmath43 and @xmath44 , there exists a _",
    "cut edge _ @xmath45 that crosses the cut . denote the total flow through cut edge @xmath45 in a unit time interval by @xmath46 .",
    "now recall from network flow theory  @xcite that the maximum flow rate from the source to the destination is specified by the minimal cut of the equivalent graph ( [ eqn : g_equiv ] ) .",
    "consequently , we arrive at the following convex flow optimization problem that can be solved using standard optimization techniques : @xmath47 over all flow allocations @xmath25 and all time slot lengths @xmath48 , subject to    * the _ non - negativity constraints _ : @xmath25 , @xmath49 for all cut edges @xmath45 and @xmath50 , * the _ total - time constraint _ : @xmath51 , * the _ power ( capacity ) constraints _ : * * for a bc slot the flow rates should lie in the capacity region of the bc channel with the transmitting node having a power constraint of @xmath10 , * * for an ma slot the flow rates should lie in the capacity region of the ma channel with a maximum power constraint @xmath10 for each transmitting node , * the _ flow constraints _ : considering steady state operation , the total information flow out of a relay should equal the flow into the relay in each unit time interval .    note that the dependence of the objective function on the channel gains and the time slot lengths is implicitly expressed through the capacity constraints . denote the cut separating @xmath19 from all the other nodes and the cut separating @xmath20 from all nodes as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "then we observe that the cost function in ( [ eqn : main_opt_prob1 ] ) above can be further simplified to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the total flows across the above - mentioned cuts @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . to see this , consider the cut @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for some @xmath59 . the total flow across this cut",
    "is given by @xmath60    now , consider node @xmath7 for @xmath61 . according to the flow constraint for node @xmath7 , @xmath62 summing ( [ eqn : node_i_flow ] ) over all @xmath61",
    "we get @xmath63 since @xmath64 , combining ( [ eqn : bc_cut ] ) , ( [ eqn : flow_thru_c ] ) and ( [ eqn : nodes_i2l_flow ] ) gives @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath66 .",
    "thus the cost function in ( [ eqn : main_opt_prob1 ] ) reduces to the above - mentioned form .",
    "in this section , we present the gls protocol and establish the optimality of the fo and gls protocols in terms of the dmt .",
    "this is accomplished in three steps .",
    "first , we apply the fo protocol to the three - node relay network .",
    "next , we propose the gls protocol based on a selection strategy that is sub - optimal to the fo protocol of section  [ sec : gdesgn ] . finally , the optimality of the gls protocol , and thereby , that of the fo protocol , is established .",
    "the three - node relay network consists of a source ( @xmath19 ) , a relay ( @xmath67 ) , and a destination ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we specialize the general design described in the previous section to this three - node relay network .",
    "a unit time interval is divided into two time slots of lengths @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 . during the first time slot",
    ", @xmath19 sends ( via bc ) two flows of rates @xmath71 and @xmath72 to @xmath20 and @xmath67 , respectively , resulting in the basic graph @xmath73 . during the second time slot ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath19 send ( via ma ) two flows of rates @xmath74 and @xmath75 to @xmath20 , respectively , resulting in the basic graph @xmath76 . combining the two basic graphs yields the equivalent graph as @xmath77 .",
    "note that the information flow of rate @xmath78 sent by @xmath67 during the ma time slot is from the flow of rate @xmath79 it received during the bc time slot .",
    "thus , we have the flow constraint @xmath80 .",
    "the rate for this network is specified by the min - cut which is clearly @xmath81 .",
    "hence , the flow optimization problem is given by : @xmath82 over flow allocations @xmath83 , and time slot lengths @xmath84 , subject to    * _ non - negativity constraints : _ @xmath85 , * _ total - time constraint : _ @xmath86 , * _ power constraints : _ @xmath87 for the bc slot , + @xmath88 for the ma slot , * _ flow constraint : _",
    "@xmath89 ,    where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , the minimum snr required for the source to broadcast at rates @xmath92 and @xmath79 to the destination and the relay , respectively , in the first time slot with @xmath93 , is given by ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) for proof ) @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "note that for the bc slot , the last two constraints are redundant when @xmath97 , and complements the first constraint when @xmath95 .    the solution of this flow optimization problem is given in appendix  [ app : opt_soln ] . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the above optimization problem formulation is different from that in  @xcite wherein the sum of the source and relay powers , required to achieve a certain data rate , is minimized . more specifically ,",
    "when considering individual power constraints for each node , we can not use part @xmath98 of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) to describe the power constraints for the ma slot .",
    "this is because doing so would restrict the flows @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that the sum of powers expended at @xmath19 and @xmath67 is minimized . on the other hand , in the present problem , the power constraints only dictate that the flow - rates should lie in the ma capacity region specified by the maximum power available at each transmitting node , for the particular fading state . with this modification in the constraint for the ma slot , the solution approach to the above problem needs to be markedly different from that in  @xcite as shown in appendix  [ app : opt_soln ] . the maximum information rate from the source @xmath19 to the destination @xmath20 for different cases",
    "is summarized below :    \\a ) @xmath101 : the maximum rate is @xmath102 with direct transmission from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",

    "thus for a given power limit ( i.e. a given @xmath107 ) at the nodes , relaying is advantageous only when @xmath103 .",
    "further , the optimal solution always allocates a non - zero flow to the direct link . also , the relay - destination link gain @xmath108 does not influence the strategy of transmission ( i.e. whether to use only the direct link or both the relay and direct links ) , but only the amount of information through the relay link .      for the general @xmath1-node relay network",
    ", the flow optimization solution can be computationally demanding even for moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "the gls protocol described below provides a simple sub - optimal design to address this complexity issue .",
    "in essence , the gls protocol identifies the _ best _ relay path out of the possible @xmath109 relay paths and considers only the chosen relay along with the source and destination to form a three - node relay network , which we call a _ generalized - link _ from the source to the destination , for information transmission . in other words , the aim is to choose the best relay such that the equivalent three - node relay network obtained ( containing the source , destination and the chosen relay ) gives the maximum rate over all possible equivalent three - node networks containing the source and destination .",
    "more precisely , we need to consider the following possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath110 for all @xmath111 : from the results of the optimization problem ( [ eqn:3node_opt ] ) , it is clear that the maximum rate would be @xmath112 with direct transmission of all data from the source to the destination without using any relay . 2 .",
    "there exists a @xmath113 such that @xmath114 : let the set of all such node indices be @xmath115 and for all @xmath116 , @xmath110 . for this case , choose the node @xmath117 as the relay such that @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the maximum rate for the three - node relay network with the source @xmath19 , the relay @xmath120 and destination @xmath20 .    in terms of the worst - case computational complexities for the fo and gls protocols",
    ", it can be seen that , for an @xmath1-node relay network with @xmath121 , the fo protocol involves a max - min optimization over @xmath122 variables ( all possible flows and time slot lengths ) , subject to @xmath123 non - linear and @xmath124 linear constraints , whereas the gls protocol involves a maximum of @xmath109 maximizations of a non - linear concave function over two variables , subject to two linear constraints , followed by finding the maximum of @xmath109 real numbers with a worst - case complexity of @xmath125 . moreover , for @xmath121 , for the fo protocol , the bc slots potentially involve @xmath126- and @xmath127-level superposition coding ( spc ) or dirty paper coding ( dpc ) implementations for @xmath19 and the relays respectively , while the ma slots at the relays and @xmath20 may involve a maximum of @xmath128 and @xmath127 interference cancelation ( ic ) operations respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the gls protocol involves a maximum of @xmath98-level spc / dpc and one ic operation for the bc and ma slots respectively , for any @xmath121 .",
    "as in @xcite , the multiplexing gain @xmath129 where @xmath107 is the snr and @xmath130 is the rate at an snr level of @xmath107 . following @xcite , we parameterize the system , in terms of the snr @xmath107 and the multiplexing gain , @xmath131 , with the rate increasing with the snr as @xmath132 . with the parameterization @xmath133 , the diversity order achieved by the transmission scheme",
    "is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the average probability of error when the snr is @xmath107 and multiplexing gain @xmath136 .",
    "the following theorem , whose proof is outlined in appendix  [ app : pf_dm_sub_opt ] , establishes the optimality of the the gls protocol ( and hence the fo protocol ) in terms of the dmt :    [ thm : dm_sub_opt ] the gls and fo protocols achieve the optimal dmt @xmath137 for all @xmath131 , for the @xmath1-node half - duplex wireless relay network .",
    "using the outage probability as the performance metric , we compare the fo and gls protocols against the max - min selection method of @xcite , as it provides the best performance amongst previously proposed path selection methods , and an outage probability lower bound derived using the max - flow - min - cut theorem of ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.10.1 ) .",
    "for the four - node relay network , there can be 6 possible time slots in the fo protocol as shown in fig .",

    ", we use max - flow - min - cut type bounds for half - duplex communication .",
    "there are four possible time slots as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4_node_lb ] , with the first bc slot and the last ma slot at the destination same as in the fo protocol , but now , the source and a relay may transmit simultaneously to the other relay and the destination during each of the intermediate slots over interference channels .",
    "we use the max - flow - min - cut theorem to upper bound the maximum information flow in these two time slots .",
    "for the five - node relay network , there can be 8 possible time slots in the fo protocol - four bc slots for the source and the three relays to transmit information , and four ma slots for the three relays and the destination to receive information respectively .",
    "similar to the four - node relay network case , for the max - flow - min - cut bound , there are @xmath138 possible time slots with the first bc slot and the last ma slot at the destination being the same as for the fo protocol , and multi - source - multi - destination transmissions during the six intermediate slots .    with the above division of time slots ,",
    "the formalization of the problem is done as in the previous sections , and we use the optimization routine of @xcite to obtain the maximum achievable rates and upper bounds for different values of required rates . in figs .",

    "[ fig:5node_case_1u_r1 ] and [ fig:5node_case_6u_r6 ] present the same for the five - node relay network . when compared to the fo protocol",

    "moreover , for the four - node relay network , the fo protocol is within @xmath148db ( when @xmath149bit / s / hz ) to within @xmath150db ( when @xmath147bits / s / hz ) of the lower bound on the outage probability when the outage probability is @xmath144 . for the five - node relay network ,",

    "a , the source - relay links are , on average , better than the direct link , and one relay node is , on average , a better candidate to forward the information to @xmath20 . on the other hand , in case b , no one relay has very good source - relay and relay - destination links , whereas the inter - relay link is , on average , very good .",
    "this promotes increased inter - relay flows when using the fo protocol , and thereby highlights the limitations of the gls protocol .",
    "the differences between the outage performances of the fo and gls protocols , at an outage probability of @xmath144 , are @xmath153db or @xmath142db , and @xmath154db or @xmath155db ( when @xmath149bits / s / hz or @xmath147bits / s / hz ) , for cases a and b respectively .",

    "the difference between the outage performance of the fo protocol and the lower bound increases from @xmath143db to @xmath156db , and from @xmath157db to @xmath158db as the required rate increases from @xmath140bit / s / hz to @xmath141bits / s / hz , for cases a and b respectively .",
    "overall , these results demonstrate trends similar to the uniform average power gain case , and confirm the generality of the proposed protocols .",
    "we proposed a cooperative transmission design for a general multi - node half - duplex wireless relay network .",
    "it is based on optimizing information flows , using the basic components of bc and ma , to maximize the transmission rate from the source to the destination , subject to maximum power constraints at individual nodes .",
    "we also proposed the simpler gls protocol , that combines relay selection , and flow optimization for a three - node relay network .",
    "these protocols were shown to achieve the optimal dmt for a general relay network .",
    "simulation results for the four- and five - node relay networks for uniform and non - uniform average power gains demonstrate that the performance of the much simpler gls protocol is close to that of the fo protocol .",
    "this suggests that the gls protocol can be used in systems with low - complexity requirements .",
    "we also note that the proposed fo and gls protocols can be used in wireless networks with topologies more complicated that the wireless relay network considered here .",
    "for example , application of similar ideas to a parallel relay network in which there is no direct connection between the source and the destination is considered in @xcite .",
    "we consider two cases with regard to the link gains : ( a ) @xmath101 , and ( b ) @xmath159 .",
    "for both cases , we solve the optimization problem in two stages : first , we fix @xmath160 such that @xmath86 and find the optimal flows @xmath161 in terms of @xmath84 , and then , find the optimal values for @xmath84 to maximize the objective function .      to obtain an analytical solution to the optimization problem and better insight into the nature of the solution to the flow optimization problem , we modify the representation of the bc slot power constraint from that in   to the one that is more conventionally used to describe the capacity region of the gaussian bc channel , as presented in  . using the flow constraint in ( [ eqn:3node_opt ] ) , we first solve   for fixed @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath162 @xmath163 here , @xmath164 $ ] is the fraction of total power spent at the source to transmit @xmath165 directly to the destination during the bc slot , and @xmath166 .",
    "although , this modification of the bc slot power constraint apparently makes the optimization problem non - convex owing to the non - convexity in @xmath167 , as we shall see in the sequel , this issue can be handled easily by utilizing the monotonicity of the logarithm function .",
    "denote the optimal solution by @xmath168 and the corresponding maximum rate by @xmath169 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath170 .",
    "suppose that @xmath171 . since @xmath172 is a decreasing function of @xmath167 , we can increase @xmath167 from @xmath173 to @xmath174 such that @xmath175 and @xmath176 . thus the objective function becomes @xmath177 at @xmath174 .",
    "this contradicts the optimality of @xmath178 . as a consequence",
