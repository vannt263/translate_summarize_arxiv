    "roughly 20 years ago , an exciting new set of methods has been introduced into game theory : an underlying game @xmath0 , such as the minority game , played by a large ensemble of players , can be analyzed and often solved using methods from statistical physics . for comprehensive overviews on the development of this subject ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the analysis exhibits critical points where phase transitions appear in the thermodynamic limit of many players and it provides models for the emergence of mutual cooperation .",
    "the evolution of a large set of agents with prescribed strategies or learning mechanisms have been studied as dynamical systems e.g. in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "+ in this article , we want to focus on the influence of a large ensemble of agents on the game theory of a given game @xmath0 , including game matrix and nash equilibria . in the model we study",
    ", the game @xmath0 is embedded into a hierarchy of automata / agents , that pass decisions by majority votes .",
    "the top of the hierarchy remains a set of new active / deciding players , which now play a new transformed game @xmath1 .",
    "we then wish to understand how the game theory of @xmath1 compared to @xmath0 changes , depending on the given intermediate hierarchy .",
    "this has been solved by the first author as part of her diploma thesis @xcite .",
    "+ more specifically , in section 2 we suppose that we are given a weighted directed graph @xmath2 and a game @xmath3 played by a subset of the vertices @xmath4 of @xmath2 called _ executive players _ @xmath5 . we define a transformed game @xmath6 with new players @xmath7 .",
    "the graph hereby is imagined as a hierarchy of agents with executive players @xmath8 at the bottom of the hierarchy , while new _ deciding players _ @xmath9 at the top of the hierarchy successively control the behaviour of the agents according to their influence .",
    "conversely , the _ payoff of @xmath0 _ for all executive players @xmath8 is finally collected by the deciding players according to the natural bargaining process in this situation ( shapely value ) .",
    "other payoff mechanisms are possible and got discussed in @xcite as well .",
    "+ the main example for this model we have in mind is the stock market , where the deciding players @xmath9 send instructions through a graph that represents the structure of the mutual ownerships of the companies .",
    "finally , some executive companies @xmath8 play a executive game @xmath0 in `` reality '' , such as prisoner s dilemma or minority game .",
    "so we ask , how the stock market and mutual ownerships of the intermediate agents / companies have altered the game @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "+ to solve @xmath1 thermodynamically , we need more than a partition function summing over all possible strategies as done e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "rather , the conditional probabilities of one agent s decision influencing another one have to be calculated .",
    "they correspond physically to @xmath10-point correlation functions ( see definition [ def_k - point ] ) and especially for @xmath11 ( no deciding players ) the overall expression reduces to the partition function . + in section 3 , we recognize that for treelike hierarchy graphs our @xmath10-point correlation functions coincide with a generalized ising model on the graph @xmath2 .",
    "this enables us in principle to write down the game matrix , nash equilibria and phase transitions of the game @xmath1 for a given game @xmath0 whenever the ising model for @xmath2 is accessible .",
    "of particular interest to us is the case where @xmath2 is a random graph , which has been solved in @xcite .",
    "+ in section 4 we demonstrate the approach and methods developed in this article .",
    "we solve and thoroughly analyse an example of an executive prisoners dilemma @xmath0 being transformed to a hierarchical game @xmath1 with again two deciding players , but with a certain hierarchy of agents between deciders and executive @xmath0-players .",
    "+ especially , we can establish a phase transition in the game @xmath1 , if the branching factor of the tree is sufficiently high ( otherwise we get only a tipping point ) as the mutual influence approaches a critical threshold . the phase transition in @xmath1",
    "separates a phase with the ( defecting ) nash equilibrium in @xmath0 from a phase corresponding to the ( cooperating ) pareto - efficient outcome .",
    "roughly spoken , if the mutual dependency in decision making gets high , egoistic strategies become unstable and mutual cooperation emerges .",
    "in the following we suppose to be given a weighted directed graph @xmath2 , whose vertices contain among others executive players @xmath8 playing a game @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose @xmath0 to have only two moves . the graph should be imagined as a hierarchy with executive players @xmath8 at the bottom of the hierarchy .",
    "the key notion of this article is then a transformed game @xmath12 with new deciding players @xmath9 at the top of the hierarchy , who successively control the behaviour of the agents and collect the @xmath0-payoff according to their influence .",

    "roughly we find that if the mutual dependency in decision making gets high , egoistic strategies become unstable and mutual cooperation emerges .",

    "we nevertheless propose in complete analogy to statistical mechanics to assign in such a situation the conditional probabilities , which clearly reduce to the previous expression when no directed cycle is present :    @xmath79 with the following now nontrivial normalization constant called partition function @xmath80    this expression can be justified by a random experiment as follows : let the probability space be @xmath81 with product measure @xmath82 take as events @xmath83 to be the event that holds @xmath84 and analogously for @xmath85 .",

    "so how is this payoff collected finally by the executive players in @xmath9 ?",

    "an example for this payoff collecting mechanism is the paying of dividends proportional to the amount of stocks held by an owner .",
    "however , in the following we will restrict ourselves to the natural result of a bargaining process between the deciding players @xmath9 according to their influence - the payoff is hence determined by the shapely value @xcite of the obvious coalition function : @xmath97 this particular choice for a payoff collection mechanism has moreover the nice property to only depend on the conditional influences @xmath57 .",
