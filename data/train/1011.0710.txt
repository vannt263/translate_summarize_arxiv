    "the bright and unusual radio continuum sources in the central few hundred pc of the galaxy provide an opportunity to observe the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen in absorption .",
    "previous hi absorption studies toward the galactic center ( gc ) have been crucial in the understanding of galactic structure and rotation and the nature of atomic gas in the inner parts of the galaxy ( e.g. , schwarz , shaver & ekers 1977 ; radhakrishnan & sarma 1980 ; schwarz , ekers & goss 1982 ; liszt et al .",

    "there are several well - known hi components in the direction of the gc ( cohen & davies 1979 ) : ( 1 ) the expanding 3 kpc arm appears at v=@xmath253 km s@xmath1 and is thought to be @xmath05.5 kpc from the sun , ( 2 ) hi components near v=+135 km s@xmath1  are thought to be beyond the gc by distances of a few hundred parsecs to 2 kpc , and ( 3 ) the `` nuclear disk '' and `` molecular ring '' components appearing at velocities of @xmath2160 to @xmath2200 km s@xmath1 and @xmath2135 km s@xmath1 are located within a few hundred parsecs of the gc .    in the inner galaxy , atomic gas is most often associated with regions of molecular gas where it serves to shield the molecular gas against photodissociation ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , hi absorption features not described above may be identified with known gc molecular emission features using correlations in velocity structure .",
    "the co survey carried out by oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using the nobeyama 45-m telescope provides the most favorable resolution , velocity , and spatial coverage of any survey of molecular gas within the central galaxy .",
    "in addition , the multitude of `` forbidden '' ( e.g. sign opposite to galactic rotation ) velocity components in the gc region are thought to represent the response of the molecular gas in the gc to the galaxy s strong stellar bar ( binney et al .",
    "1991 ; bally et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the co survey data of oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) illustrated that the molecular gas traced by co emission in the central 200 pc is organized into filamentary and shell - like features .",
    "this morphology and kinetic structure indicates that violent kinetic activity ( such as supernova explosions and stellar winds from wolf - rayet type stars ) plays an important role in shaping the ism .",
    "in addition to the radio arc region ( where the quintuplet and arches clusters are located ) , the gc region is filled with sites where compact thermal radio and mid - infrared sources have been observed ( e.g. sgr b , sgr c , and at many positions along the galactic plane ; e.g. , larosa et al .",
    "2000 ; egan et al .",
    "1998 ) and it is likely that massive stars are either forming or have formed in these regions . in addition , the spectrum of diffuse x - ray emission in this region suggests that the ism is being strongly influenced by massive star - forming activities ( wang , gotthelf & lang 2002 ; wang , dong & lang 2006 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) ) , a complete hi absorption study is missing from the growing canon of gc surveys .",
    "therefore , we have carried out an hi absorption survey of the central 100  @xmath450  ( 250 x 125 pc ) of the gc in order ( 1 ) to understand the physical _ arrangement _ and _ interactions _ between the stellar and interstellar components , ( 2 ) to place constraints on distances to radio continuum features in the field of view , and ( 3 ) to make detailed images and estimates of the hi opacity toward well - studied gc sources .",

    "the continuum mosaic was imaged using _ mosmem _ , and each plane of the hi absorption cube was cleaned to a uniform rms level using _ mossdi _ in miriad .",
    "the final spatial resolution of both the continuum and hi absorption line images is 15 .",
    "the integration time was 8 hours for the set of five fields in each configuration ( i.e. , approximately 2.5 hours on each field ) which resulted in an rms level of 3 - 4 mjy beam@xmath1 in the continuum image .",
    "the zero level in the continuum image is within 1@xmath6 ( 10 mjy ) of zero , and the image has also been corrected for the variable system temperature with frequency in the presence of hi emission .",

    "the change in hi absorption across the ntf ( from @xmath8@xmath12=0.45 to 0.15 from part a to part b ) indicates that the atomic and molecular material may be located partially in front of the ntf as the continuum brightness of the ntf does not vary substantially across these regions .",

    "figure 36 ( right ) and figure 37 show the hi absorption toward three hii regions adjacent to sgr c : fir 4 , source c and d. due to the low surface brightness of fir 4 in the 1.4 ghz continuum , the hi absorption data has low signal to noise ( figure 36 ( right ) ) .",
