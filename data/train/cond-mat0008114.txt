    "the traditional approach to determining the number fluctuations in a given quantum state relies on the statistical description of the system based on the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) . for bosons ,",
    "if @xmath1 is the average occupancy of a single orbital @xmath2 , then the mean - square fluctuation in gce is given by  @xcite @xmath3 .",
    "as the temperature @xmath4 for the boson system , however , there is macroscopic occupancy in the ground state , with the result that the relative fluctuation @xmath5 .",
    "this is clearly absurd , since at @xmath0 , none of the bosons ( in the noninteracting case ) should be in the excited orbitals , so the fluctuation should vanish . this problem , first discussed by fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite , is of topical interest with the discovery of bose - einstein condensation in a dilute gas of alkali atoms confined in a trap  @xcite .",
    "the problem of number fluctuation from the ground state of a system of confined fermions is also of interest due to the recent developments in the field of quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the fluctuation in bose - einstein systems has been addressed in a series of papers@xcite both in micro - canonical and canonical ensemble framework .",
    "a clear and unambiguous definition of the fluctuation has been given for calculating the ground state occupation number fluctuation by grossman and holthaus@xcite through the `` microcanonical entropy '' of an n - particle bose system .",
    "detailed comparisons between the two methods for noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap have been made by holthaus and kalinowski  @xcite , where analytical expressions for the two are also given using a modified saddle - point approximation .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the exact calculation of the ground state fluctuation for a small number of fermions confined in a trap . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding calculations are also done for bosons . to this end , a combinatorial method based on microcanonical counting is developed in sect.(ii ) , and calculations are made for particles in one and two - dimensional harmonic traps .",
    "these exact results are then compared with the corresponding canonical ensemble calculations .",
    "the two methods yield substantially different , though qualitatively similar results .",
    "as explained later , we expect this deficiency of the canonical ensemble averaging method to persist for fermions at low excitation , even when the fermion number in the trap is large . in sect.(iii ) we show that even though the canonical entropies for noninteracting bosons and fermions in a one - dimensional harmonic trap are identical , the number fluctuations in the ground state are vastly different . the numerical results are discussed in sect.(iv ) .",
    "we assume an independent particle model where the one particle partition function is given analytically , or may be computed . we first give the well - known recipe of calculating the @xmath6- particle quantum canonical partition system from this . at zero temperature",
    "all the particles are in the ground state . at a finite temperature ,",
    "however , the excitation energy may be shared in many different ways amongst the particles , with the result that the population in the original ground state is not fixed , although the total number , @xmath6 , is still the same .",
    "our objective here is to define and calculate this fluctuation in the ground state occupation as a function of excitation energy or , equivalently , temperature .",
    "the canonical partition function for bosons and fermions in any space dimension may be written as @xmath7^{n_j}}{n_j ! } , \\label{master}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the single particle partition function , @xmath9 is the inverse temperature and the upper and lower signs refer to bosons and fermions respectively .",
    "the sum over the set of integers @xmath10 is constrained by the relation @xmath11 the above formula allows us to write a general recursion relationship for the canonical partition function @xmath12 for bosons @xmath13 and fermions @xmath14 .",
    "we note that in the above recursion relation @xmath15 is formally taken to be unity for consistency .    in order to perform explicit calculations , we specialise to the case of a harmonic oscillator in d - dimensions . the single particle partition function is given by , @xmath16^d\\ ] ] where @xmath17    the canonical partition function for a system with @xmath6 particles is then computed using eq.([master ] ) and is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a polynomial in x which depends on the dimension and the statistics of the system .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath20 and @xmath21 for bosons and fermions where necessary .",
    "the polynomial may be calculated using the recursion relation in eq.([recursion ] ) @xmath22 the recursion relation above should be used with the condition @xmath23 for both bosons and fermions .",
    "we further note that in one - dimension @xmath24 for bosons and @xmath25 for fermions .",
    "they are however more complicated in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we first define the fluctuation in particle number from the ground state at a given excitation energy through a set of counting rules .",
    "again we first write down the general formulae for a given a set of discrete energy levels , and then specialize to the harmonic trap .",
    "the single particle partition function may be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the single particle energies .",
    "it is understood that @xmath9 in the exponent defining @xmath29 has been multiplied by a characteristic energy scale of the system , and similarly @xmath30 has been divided by the same , which we put to unity for convenience . for the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "this energy scale is @xmath31 , and @xmath29 is given by eq.([kala ] ) . substituting this into eq.([master ] ) , and expressing @xmath32 in a power series in @xmath29 , we obtain  @xcite @xmath33 where the @xmath6-particle eigen - energies @xmath34 form an ordered set , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 denoting the ground state energy and the excitation energy with respect to the ground state respectively . the expansion coefficient @xmath37 denotes the number of possible ways of distributing the excitation energy @xmath36 in utmost n particles@xcite .",
    "furthermore we may write @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the number of possible ways of distributing the excitation energy @xmath36 amongst _ exactly _ @xmath41 particles .",
    "hence the probability of exciting exactly @xmath41 particles from an @xmath6-particle system at an excitation energy @xmath36 is given by @xmath42 by definition this probability is properly normalised .",
    "further the probability has the following properties : @xmath43    the number fluctuation in the ground state of the system may now be defined in terms of the moments of the probability distribution given above .",
    "we first define the moments : @xmath44 and the number fluctuation from the ground state is given by , @xmath45 since @xmath46 .",
    "few remarks are in order here : the above definitions apply equally well to bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "the fluctuation in the number of particles from the ground state is expressed here as a function of the excitation energy with respect to the ground state . in the case of bosons",
    "this is just the fluctuation from the lowest energy single - particle state , where as for fermions it is the number fluctuation across the ( zero temperature ) fermi energy .",
    "formally the above expressions complete the necessary basic definitions for further analysis .",
    "in actual practice the counting of the number of possibilities to which a system may be excited is non - trivial . in the following , we give an example of bosons and fermions in a harmonic oscillator potential for the explicit calculation of @xmath47 . henceforth , we consider the excitation energy from the ground state to be @xmath48 , and denote the corresponding microcanonical multiplicity to be @xmath49 .",
    "+ ( a ) bosons in a @xmath50-dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "+ in the case of a harmonic oscillator trap , all the single particle energy levels in a given shell have the same energy",
    ". the shell may be characterised by the index @xmath51 with energy @xmath52 , and degeneracy @xmath53 .",
    "when the excitation energy is zero ( equivalently at zero temperature ) all the @xmath6 particles are in the ground state .",
    "now consider exciting @xmath41 particles from this ground state that share @xmath54 quanta of energy .",
    "let there be @xmath55 bosons with 1 quantum of excitation energy , @xmath56 bosons with 2 quanta of excitation , and so on .",
    "we then have @xmath57 and @xmath58 this is just a way of partitioning an integer @xmath54 into exactly @xmath41 partitions with @xmath59 denoting the number of times an integer @xmath2 appears in a partition ( it is taken to be zero if some integer between 1 and @xmath60 does not appear in the partition ) .",
    "all the @xmath59 bosons occupy the state @xmath61 , since @xmath62 is the ground state .",
    "the number of ways these @xmath59 bosons are distributed in the state @xmath61 is given by the counting rule @xmath63 the set @xmath64 denotes the set of all partitions of n for a given @xmath41 .",
    "the microcanonical distribution @xmath65 is then given by @xmath66 the formula for @xmath65 is especially simple in one dimension since there is no degeneracy , @xmath67 for all @xmath51 .",
    "we have , @xmath68 and the number of possibilities are determined by the number of ways an integer @xmath54 can be partitioned into @xmath41 integers , that is the number of ways we can write , @xmath69 once the @xmath65 s are known the probability distribution may be calculated using the eq.([probability ] ) and hence the fluctuations as a function of the excitation energy . in order to express this as a function of temperature , one may use the relation between excitation energy above the ground state and the temperature to be discussed presently ( see eq.([extotemp ] ) .",
    "we , however , prefer to present all results as a function of the excitation energy only .",
    "since @xmath70 always , we can give an alternative expression for @xmath65 as  @xcite @xmath71 while this allows an alternative and probably a simpler way of calculating probability distribution , it is valid only for bosons ( see the discussion following eq.([mushkil ] ) given later ) .",
    "+ ( b ) fermions in a harmonic - oscillator ( closed shell ) .",
    "+ for simplicity , the fermions are taken to be spinless , and filling an integral number of shells in the ground state .",
    "the determination of microcanonical distribution @xmath72 is more involved than in the case of bosons .",
    "the combinatoric rules depend on the space dimension . using the same notation for the harmonic oscillator single particle energies in a given shell",
    ", we calculate the number of possibilities by which @xmath41 particles can be excited from the ground state . note that removing @xmath41 fermions from the ground state leaves as many holes in ground state . as a result",
    "the @xmath65 depends not only on the distribution of fermions in the excited states ( as in the case of bosons ) , but also on how the holes are distributed in the ground state . for simplicity",
    "we choose a completely closed shell system , the rules may be appropriately modified for open shells .",
    "we assume that n - fermions form a closed - shell system at @xmath0 with shells up to @xmath51 ( corresponding to fermi energy @xmath73 ) filled . thus @xmath41 holes are distributed in states from @xmath62 up to @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the number of holes in the state @xmath2 such that @xmath76 the number of ways @xmath75 holes may be created in the @xmath2th state is given by @xmath77 .",
    "hence the number of ways in which @xmath41 holes may be created in the ground state is given by the product over the number of ways in which the holes may be distributed in the @xmath51 orbitals , i.e. , @xmath78 now consider exciting @xmath41 particles from this ground state sharing @xmath54 quanta of energy .",
    "an allowed configuration is one in which each and every one of these @xmath41 particles is found in states above the fermi energy , with the shell indices ranging from @xmath79 up to @xmath80 , such that their excitation energies add up to yield the total @xmath81 . this complicates the counting rules for fermions as compared to bosons .",
    "we shall denote the occupancy of orbitals for the excited particles by @xmath59 , where @xmath82 .",
    "the number of ways the @xmath59 femions are distributed in the state @xmath83 is then given by the counting rule @xmath84 the microcanonical distribution @xmath65 is then given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 , and the microcanonical multiplicity @xmath65 is obtained by summing over all the allowed possibilities such that the sum total of the excited quanta is exactly @xmath54 .",
    "once the @xmath65 s are known the probability distribution may be calculated using the eq.([probability ] ) and hence the fluctuation as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "we compare these results with the fluctuations obtained by the canonical ensemble averaging method of parvan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite as detailed below .",
    "it is our objective to see how close are the results for the ground state fluctuations calculated by the two methods .      in statistical thermodynamics , a macro - state at a given energy",
    "may be built up by many combinatorial ways from the micro - states , and this is denoted by the term multiplicity of the macro - state . as we saw in the preceding sect.(ii a ) , the multiplicity @xmath87 was defined by eq.([omega ] ) through this counting method . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", we may alternately define @xmath88~=\\exp[(u - f)/t]~=x^{-u } z_n(x)~.   \\label{thermalomega}\\ ] ] in the above , the internal energy @xmath89 is determined as usual from the canonical partition function , and excitation energy at any temperature is given by @xmath90 we may therefore compare the calculated quantities from the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles as a function of the excitation energy .    comparing @xmath91 given by eq.([thermalomega ] ) from the canonical ensemble with the series ( [ series ] ) , we see that it is as if only one term from this series is picked in the ensemble averaging .",
    "this is realized for a large number of particles , since the multiplicity @xmath87 increases rapidly with the excitation energy , where as the factor @xmath92 decreases exponentially . in this paper , we focus on systems where @xmath6 is not large , specially for fermions .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the differences in the results of the calculation made by the two methods .",
    "once the multiplicity @xmath93 is obtained , the fluctuations may be defined through a temperature dependent probability distribution@xcite , @xmath94 note that @xmath95 is determined by the canonical partition function of @xmath41 particles by replacing @xmath6 by @xmath41 in eq.([thermalomega ] ) . for bosons ,",
    "the ground state of every such system consists of a single level , and the definition given by eq.([mushkil ] ) is correct .",
    "for fermions , however , the fermi energy of a system defined by @xmath41 particles is less than the fermi energy of the full system with @xmath6 particles .",
    "the fluctuations are defined with respect to the ground state with the fermi energy corresponding to the full system .",
    "therefore eq.([mushkil ] ) can not be applied to fermions .",
    "a consistent definition of ground state fluctuations applicable to both fermions and bosons , and which coincides for the bosonic calculation with the probability definition ( [ mushkil ] ) , may however be given by the ensemble averaging method  @xcite .",
    "we summarise the method below .    the canonical partition function in eq.([series ] )",
    "may be written in the occupation number representation as@xcite @xmath96 where we have used the fact that the energy of the @xmath6- particle system for a given set of occupancies @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 .",
    "the occupancy @xmath99 for fermions and may take any value up to @xmath6 for bosons . at finite temperatures , using the recursion relation in eq.([recursion ] ) , and some nontrivial algebra , the ensemble - averaged moments of the occupancy @xmath100 may be written as  @xcite @xmath101 where the upper and lower signs refer to bosons and fermions respectively .",
    "the ground state fluctuation is now given by , @xmath102 the sum runs through all the allowed @xmath51 values in the ground state defined at zero temperature .",
    "note that the moments of occupancy are defined without any reference to the ground state .",
    "the fluctuation is then obtained by summing over the single particle states occupied at zero temperature . in the counting method as outlined earlier , the fluctuations necessarily refer to the ground state .    applying the above equations to a system of bosons in a harmonic trap , we get @xmath103 the ground state fluctuation",
    "is given by eq.([thermalfluct ] ) , @xmath104    similarly , the thermodynamic expression for the ground state fluctuations for the fermionic system in a harmonic oscillator is obtained from eq.([avnkx ] ) and eq.([avnksx ] ) : @xmath105 where @xmath106 refers to the degeneracy factor of the the state @xmath107 . for the n - fermion system that forms a closed shell system at @xmath0 with filled shells up to @xmath51 , with fermi energy @xmath73",
    ", the ground state fluctuation is given by eq.([thermalfluct ] ) : @xmath108    before using these formulae for the calculation of ground state occupancy and fluctuations , we discuss below the specially interesting case of the one - dimensional harmonic confinement where the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles yield vastly different results .",
    "the one - dimensional harmonic trap is specially interesting because even though the canonical entropies for bosons and fermions are identical , the number fluctuations from the ground state are very different .",
    "this may be seen by writing the canonical @xmath6-particle partition function as @xmath109 with @xmath110 for bosons , and @xmath111 for fermions .",
    "actually , for other positive values of @xmath112 , the above form is the exact partition function for the so - called calogero - sutherland model  @xcite , where the @xmath6 particles interact pair - wise by a potential @xmath113 . for bosons ,",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath112 is in the range @xmath114 , while for fermions @xmath115 .",
    "the special values @xmath116 give noninteracting fermions ( bosons ) .",
    "the effect of interaction has only been to shift the energy of every state by the same amount , which is absorbed in the prefactor .",
    "it follows from eqs.([series],[chacha ] ) that we may write @xmath117 and that @xmath118 is independent of the parameter @xmath112 , and is the same for bosons and fermions .",
    "since it is the logarithm of @xmath118 that determines the canonical entropy of the system at an excitation energy of @xmath54 quanta , it follows that the entropy is independent of @xmath112 .",
    "the same result is true if one calculates the ensemble averaged entropy at a given temperature .",
    "this may be easily verified by using the relation @xmath119 for the free energy , and then calculating the entropy @xmath120 .    for the microcanonical calculation of the fluctuation ,",
    "we need to calculate the microcanonical multiplicity @xmath72 , which is the number of ways of distributing the @xmath54 excitation quanta amongst exactly @xmath41 particles .",
    "although the relation @xmath121 is obeyed both by fermions and bosons , and the lhs of the above equation is the same for both , the microcanonical counting of @xmath65 s are very different for the two cases . in the appendix",
    ", this is illustrated explicitly for @xmath122 .",
    "thus the fluctuations for the bosonic and fermionic cases differ substantially when the exact counting method is used . as is to be expected , the fermionic fluctuation is considerably suppressed compared to the bosonic system .",
    "the same qualitative conclusion may also be reached by using eqs.([bavnksx ] , [ favnksx ] ) based on canonical ensemble averaging rather than exact counting . in the next section , we display these results , as well as the results for the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "in fig.(1 ) , we display ( a ) the ground state occupancy @xmath123 and ( b ) the relative fluctuation @xmath124 for @xmath125 noninteracting particles in a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the canonical and the exact microcanonical results are compared as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "the canonical method gives results in close agreement with counting for the ground state occupancy @xmath123 , but overestimates the relative fluctuation substantially .",
    "in one dimension , the number of microcanonical possibilities @xmath72 is very restricted at low excitations due to the non- degeneracy in the single - particle energy levels and the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this results in ( i)@xmath123 for fermions getting depleted more slowly than bosons , and ( ii ) reduced fluctuation . in fig.(2 ) , the same quantities are displayed for particles in a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential . it is well known from previous work@xcite that there is a peak in the relative fluctuation somewhat below the critical temperature for bosons . for fermions ,",
    "such peaking is absent , specially in the exact calculation .",
    "we thus see that the presence or absence of a peak in the number fluctuation of the ground state may signal phase transition , or its absence .    the microcanonical method of exact counting for fermions is computationally very time - consuming because , unlike bosons , eq.([mushkil ] ) can not be used .",
    "we have therefore restricted the fermionic calculations to only up to @xmath125 particles . as we see from figs ( 1 - 2 ) ,",
    "there is considerable difference in the results for the relative fluctuations for small particle numbers . for fermions",
    ", we expect this difference to persist at low excitations even when @xmath6 is large .",
    "this is because at low excitations , only a small fraction of the fermions near the fermi sea can be excited , so the effective number of fermions contributing to the number fluctuation remains small even when the system is large . for bosons ,",
    "there is no difficulty in performing the microcanonical calculation for a large number of particles . in fig.(3 ) , we show the bosonic occupancy and the relative fluctuation as a function of the number of excitation quanta for @xmath126 .",
    "we note that the occupancy @xmath123 from the canonical and exact microcanonical methods is practically identical , although the ground state fluctuation continue to differ .",
    "we have made the comparison between the microcanonical and canonical results as functions of the excitation energy , rather than temperature . in the microcanonical method ,",
    "the counting of the possibilities is done for a given excitation energy , the latter being the natural variable . in the canonical formalism , of course",
    ", a mapping from the excitation energy to temperature can be done using eq.([extotemp ] ) .",
    "we may also note that starting from the canonical eq.([thermalomega ] ) and using eq.([mushkil ] ) for bosons , one can obtain the analytical expression for the low temperature dependence of the fluctuation , as , for example , given by eq.(14 ) of @xcite .",
    "it remains a challenging problem to obtain similar microcanonical relations for fermions .",
