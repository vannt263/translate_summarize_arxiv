    "quantum communication exploits the quantum properties of its information carriers for communication purposes such as the distribution of secure cryptographic keys in quantum cryptography @xcite and the communication between distant quantum computers in a network @xcite .",
    "a central problem of quantum communication is how to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel @xcite .",
    "while information is sent through such a channel ( for example an optical fiber ) , the carriers of the information interact with the channel , which gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence and absorbtion ; an initially pure quantum state becomes a mixed state when it leaves the channel . for quantum communication purposes , it is however necessary that the transmitted qubits retain their genuine quantum properties , for example in form of an entanglement with qubits on the other side of the channel",
    ".    in quantum cryptography , noise in the communication channel plays a crucial role : in the worst - case scenario , all noise in the channel is attributed to an eavesdropper , who manipulates the qubits in order to gain as much information on their state as possible , while introducing only a moderate level of noise .    to deal with this situation , two different techniques have been developed : _ classical privacy amplification _ allows the eavesdropper to have partial knowledge about the raw key built up between the communicating parties alice and bob . from the raw key ,",
    "a shorter key is `` distilled '' about which eve has vanishing ( exponentially small in some chosen security parameter ) knowledge . despite of the simple idea , proofs taking into account all eavesdropping attacks allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics have shown to be technically involved @xcite .",
    "recently , shor and preskill @xcite have given a simpler physical proof relating the ideas in @xcite to quantum error correcting codes @xcite and , equivalently , to one - way entanglement purification protocols .",
    "_ quantum privacy amplification _ ( qpa )",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , employs a two - way entanglement purification recurrence protocol @xcite that eliminates any entanglement with an eavesdropper by creating a few perfect epr pairs out of many imperfect ( or impure ) epr pairs .",
    "the perfect epr pairs can then be used for secure key distribution in entanglement - based quantum cryptography @xcite . in principle",
    ", this method guarantees security against any eavesdropping attack .",
    "however , the problem is that the qpa protocol assumes ideal quantum operations . in reality",
    ", these operations are themselves subject to noise .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there is an upper bound @xmath0 for the achievable fidelity of epr pairs which can be distilled using noisy apparatus . _",
    "a priori _ , there is no way to be sure that there is no residual entanglement with an eavesdropper .",
    "this problem could be solved if alice and bob had fault tolerant quantum computers at their disposal , which could then be used to reduce the noise of the apparatus to any desired level .",

    "@xcite , with some minor modifications to accomodate certain security aspects as discussed below , can be used to efficiently establish a _ perfectly private quantum channel _ , even when both the physical channel connecting the parties and the local apparatus used by alice and bob are noisy .    in section [ sec : qrandqpa ]",
    "we will briefly review the concepts of entanglement purification .",
    "section [ sec : fact_of_eve ] will give the main result of our work : we prove that it is possible to _ factor out _ an eavesdropper using epp , even when the apparatus used by alice and bob is noisy .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion in section [ sec : dicussion ] .",
    "[ sec : ent_purification ] as two - way entanglement purification protocols ( 2epp ) play an important role in this paper , we will briefly review one example of a a recurrence protocol which was described in @xcite , and called _ quantum privacy amplification _ ( qpa ) by the authors .",
    "it is important to note that we distinguish the entanglement purification _ protocol _ from the distillation _ process _ :",
    "the first consists of probabilistic local operations ( unitary rotations and measurements ) , where two pairs of qubits are combined , and either one or zero pairs are kept , depending on the measurement outcomes . the latter , on the other hand , is the procedure where the purification protocol is applied to large ensemble of pairs recursively ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : ep_prot_and_proc ] ) ) .     the entanglement purification protocol ( a ) and the entanglement distillation process ( b ) . ]    in the quantum privacy amplification 2epp , two pairs of qubits , shared by alice and bob , are considered to be in the state @xmath1 . without loss of generality ( see later ) , we may assume that the state of the pairs is of the bell - diagonal form , @xmath2 following @xcite , the protocol consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "alice applies to her qubits a @xmath3 rotation , @xmath4 , bob a @xmath5 rotation about the @xmath6 axis , @xmath7 .",
    "alice and bob perform the bi - lateral cnot operation @xmath8 on the four qubits .",
    "alice and bob measure both qubits of the target pair @xmath9 of the bcnot operation in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "if the measurement results coincide , the source pair @xmath11 is kept , otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the target pair is always discarded , as it is projected onto a product state by the bilateal measurement .    by a straigtforward calculation",
    ", one gets the result that the state of the remaining pair is still a bell diagonal state , with the diagonal coefficients @xcite @xmath12 and the normalization coefficient @xmath13 , which is the probability that alice s and bob s measurement results in step 3 coincide .",
    "note that , up to the normalization , these recurrence relations are a quadratic form in the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these relations allow for the following interpretation ( which can be used to obtain the relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) in the first place ) : as all pairs are in the bell diagonal state ( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) , one can interpret @xmath16 and @xmath15 as the relative frequencies in the ensemble of all pairs of the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . by looking at ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) one",
    "finds that the result of combining two @xmath19 or two @xmath20 pairs is a @xmath19 pair , combining a @xmath21 and a @xmath18 ( or vice versa ) yields a @xmath20 pair , and so on .",
    "combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath15 that do not occur in ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) , namely @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are `` filtered out '' , they give different measurement results for the bilateral measurement in step 3 of the protocol .",
    "we will use this way of calculating recurrence relations for more complicated situations later .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite and , later , an analytical investigation @xcite have shown that for all initial states ( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) with @xmath26 , the recurrence relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) approach the fixpoint @xmath27 ; this means that given a sufficiently large number of initial pairs , alice and bob can distill asymptotically pure epr pairs .",
    "in the previous section it has been assumed that alice and bob have perfect apparatus at their disposal , which they use to execute the protocol . for the following security analysis",
    ", we shall consider a more general scenario where this assumption is abandoned .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there is an upper bound @xmath28 for the attainable fidelity of the distilled pairs , when the apparatus used by alice and bob is noisy @xcite . for quantum cryptography the question arises : can these imperfect pairs still be used for secure key distribution ?    in this section we will show that 2epp with noisy apparatus is sufficient to factor out eve in the hilbertspace of alice , bob , their labs and eve . for the proof , we will first introduce the concept of the lab demon as a simple model of noise",
    ". then we will consider the special case of binary pairs , where we have obtained analytical results .",
    "using the same techniques , we generalize the result to the case of bell diagonal ensembles .",
    "the most general case of correlated non bell - diagonal can be reduced to the case of bell diagonal states @xcite .      in this section",
    "we will answer the following question : what is the effect of an error , introduced by some noisy operation at a given point of the distillation process ? to keep the argument transparent ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the following type of noise :    * it acts locally , noise does not introduce correlations between remote quantum systems . * noise is memoryless , on a timescale imposed by the sequence of steps in a given protocol , there are no correlations between the `` errors '' that occur at different times",
    ".    the action of noisy apparatus on a quantum system in state @xmath29 can be formally described by some trace conserving , completely positive map .",
    "any such map can be written in the operator - sum representation @xcite , @xmath30 with linear operators @xmath31 , that fulfill the normalization condition @xmath32 .",
    "the operators @xmath31 are the so - called _ kraus operators _ @xcite .    as we have seen above , in the purification protocol the cnot operation , which acts on two qubits @xmath33 and @xmath34 , plays an important role .",
    "for that reason , it is necessary to consider noise which acts on a two - qubit hilbert space @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : operator_sum ] ) describes the most general non - selective operation that can , in principle , be implemented . for technical reasons , however , we restrict our attention to the case that the kraus operators are proportional to products of pauli matrices .",
    "the reason for this choice is that pauli operators map bell states onto bell states , which will allow us to introduce the very useful concept of _ error flags _ later .",
    "( [ eq : operator_sum ] ) can then be written as @xmath36 with the normalization condition @xmath37 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_model ] ) includes , for an appropriate choice of the coefficients @xmath38 , the one- and two - qubit depolarizing channel and combinations thereof , as studied in @xcite ; but it is more general .",
    "below , we will refer to these special kraus operators as _",
    "error operators_.    the coefficients @xmath38 can be interpreted as the joint probability that the pauli rotations @xmath39 and @xmath40 occur on qubits @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . for pedagogic purposes we employ the following interpretation of ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) :",
    "imagine that there is a ( ficticious ) little demon in alice s laboratory  the `` lab demon ''  which applies in each step of the distillation process randomly , according to the probability distribution @xmath38 , the pauli rotation @xmath39 and @xmath40 to the qubits @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the lab demon summarizes all relevant aspects of the lab degrees of freedom involved in the noise process .",
    "noise in bob s laboratory , can , as long as we restrict ourselves to bell diagonal ensembles , be attributed to noise introduced by alice s lab demon , without loss of generality .",
    "it is also possible to think of a second lab demon in bob s lab who acts similarly to alice s lab demon .",
    "this would , however , not affect the arguments employed in this paper .",
    "the lab demon does not only apply rotations randomly , he also maintains a list in which he keeps track of which rotation he has applied to which qubit pair in which step of the distillation process .",
    "what we will show in the following section is that , from the mere content of this list , the lab demon will be able to extract  in the asymptotic limit  full information about the state of each residual pair of the ensemble .",
    "this will then imply that , given the lab demons knowledge about the flags , the state of the distilled ensemble is a tensor product of pure bell states .",
    "eve can not not have information on the specific sequence of bell pairs ( in addition to their relative frequencies )  otherwise she would also be able to learn , to some extent , at which stage the lab demon has applied which rotation .    from that it follows that eve is factored out , alice and bob describe their pairs with the state @xmath41    it remains to be shown that the same argument applies to a realistic scenario where the lab demon is replaced by some `` real '' noise source . to be specific , in the following argument",
    "we show that _ all _ quantum or classical devices that share the same noise characteristics are equally secure .",
    "first we note that a communication protocol is secure if and only if there exists no eavesdropping strategy ; this fact can , in priciple , be determined by cooperating communication parties . on the other hand , all devices with identical noise caracteristics are quantum mechanically described by the same completely positive trace conserving map , so that a initial state @xmath42 is mapped onto a final state @xmath43 , independend from the physical realization of the map .",
    "this means that there is no way do distinguish the devices by only looking at the input and output states . for the case of noisy apparatus that is used for entanglement purification",
    "we get thus the following result : a device the implements ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) with a lab demon can not be distinguished from any device that introduces noise due to some `` real '' noise source ; in particular , the devices must lead to the same level of security ( regardless whether or not error flags are measured or calculated by anybody ) : otherwise they would be distinguishable .    in order to separate conceptual from technical considerations and to obtain analytical results ,",
    "we will first concentrate on the special case of binary pairs and a simplified error model .",
    "after that , we generalize the results to ensembles which are diagonal in the bell basis .      in this section we restrict our attention to pairs in the state @xmath44 and to errors of the form [ sec : any_initial_state ] @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( [ eq : binary_noise ] ) describes a _ two - bit correlated spin - flip channel_. the indices 1 and 2 indicate the source and target bit of the bilateral cnot ( bcnot ) operation , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , using this error model in the 2epp , binary pairs will be mapped onto binary pairs .    at the beginning of the distillation process ,",
    "alice and bob share an ensemble of pairs described by ( [ eq : binary_pairs ] ) .",
    "let us imagine that the lab demon attaches one classical bit to each pair , which he will use for book - keeping purposes . at this stage , all of these bits , which we call `` error flags '' ,",
    "are set to zero .",
    "this reflects the fact that the lab demon has the same _ a priori _ knowledge about the state of the ensemble as alice and bob .    in each purification step ,",
    "two of the pairs are combined .",
    "the lab demon first simulates the noise channel ( [ eq : binary_noise ] ) on each pair of pairs by the process described . whenever he applies a @xmath48 operation to a qubit",
    ", he inverts the error flag of the corresponding pair .",
    "alice and bob then apply the 2epp to each pair of pairs ; if the measurement results in the last step of the protocol coincide , the source pair will be kept .",
    "obviously , the error flag of that remaining pair will also depend on the error flag of the the target pair , the error flag of the remaining pair is a function of the error flags of both `` parent '' pairs , which we call the _ flag update function_. since for binary pairs the error flag consists of one bit , there are 16 different flag update functions in total . from these ,",
    "the lab demon chooses the logical and function as the flag update function , the error flag of the remaining pair is set to `` 1 '' if and only if both parent s error flags had the value `` 1 '' .",
    "after each purification step , the lab demon divides all pairs into two subensembles , according to the value of their error flags . by a straightforward calculation",
    ", one finds for the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath49 , which completely describe the state of the pairs in the subensemble @xmath50 , the following recurrence relations :    @xmath51    with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    for the case of uncorrelated noise ,",
    "@xmath54 , we find an analytical expression for the relevant fixpoint of the map ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) : @xmath55    note that , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : binary_pairs_fixpoint ] ) gives a fixpoint of ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) for @xmath56 , this does not imply that this fixpoint is an attractor .",
    "in order to investigate the attractor properties , we calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix of first derivatives , @xmath57    we found that the modulus of the eigenvalues of this matrix is smaller than unity for @xmath58 , which means that in this interval , the fixpoint ( [ eq : binary_pairs_fixpoint ] ) is also an attractor .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with a numerical evaluation of ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) , where we found that @xmath59 .    we also evaluated ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) numerically in order to investigate correlated noise ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : binary_data ] ) . like in the case of uncorrelated noise",
    ", we found that the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 reach , during the distillation process , some finite value , while the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 decrease exponentially fast , whenever the noise level is moderate .",
    "in other words , both subensembles , characterized by the value of the respective error flags , approach a pure state asymptotically .",
    "the pairs in the ensemble with error flag `` 0 '' are in the state @xmath19 , while those in the ensemble with error flag `` 1 '' are in the state @xmath21 .     the evolution of the four parameters @xmath64 , and @xmath61 .",
    "note that both @xmath62 and @xmath63 decrease exponentially fast in the number of steps . ]    to conclude this section , we summarize : for a large region @xmath65 the 2epp purifies and at the same time any eavesdropper is factored out . for a small region",
    "@xmath66 , close to the threshold of the purification protocol , the conditional fidelity does not reach unity , while the protocol is in the purification regime . even though the region is small and of little practical relevance ( in this regime we are already out of the repeater regime @xcite and purification is very inefficient )",
    ", its existence shows that the process of factorization is an independent phenomenon and not trivially connected to epp .",
    "a more exhaustive description of the intermediate regime will be published elsewhere .",
    "now we want to show that the same result is true for arbitrary bell diagonal states ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) ) and for noise of the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) .",
    "the procedure is the same as in the case of binary pairs ; however , a few modifications are required .    in order to keep track of the four different error operators @xmath39 in ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) , the lab demon has to attach two classical bits to each pair ; let us call them the phase error bit and amplitude error bit .",
    "whenever a @xmath48 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) error occurs , the lab demon inverts the error amplitude bit ( error phase bit , both error bits ) . to update these error flags",
    ", he uses the update function given in tab .  [ tab : error_flags ] ) .",
    "the physical reason for the choice of the flag update function will be given in the next section .",

    "are described by a bell diagonal density operator , like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) , which now depends on the subensemble .",
    "that means , in order to completely specify the state of all four subensembles , there are 16 real numbers @xmath69 with @xmath70 required , for which one obtaines recurrence relations of the form @xmath71 these generalize the recurrence relations ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) for the case of binary pairs , and the relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) for the case of noiseless apparatus .    like the recurrence relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) and ( [ eq : recursion_binary ] ) ,",
    "respectively , these relations are ( modulo normalization ) quadratic forms in the 16 state variables @xmath72 , with coefficients that depend on the error parameters @xmath38 only . in other words , ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) can be written in the more compact form @xmath73 where , for each @xmath74 , @xmath75 is a real @xmath76-matrix whose coefficients are polynomials in the noise parameters @xmath38 .      the 16 recurrence relations ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) imply a reduced set of 4 recurrence relations for the quantities @xmath77 which describe the evolution of the total ensemble ( that is , the _ blend _",
