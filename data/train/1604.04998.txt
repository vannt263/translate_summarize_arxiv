    "the dynamics of evolution of systems towards equilibrium has always been a challenging problem in statistical mechanics .",
    "the difficulty lies in prescribing a form of interaction at the microscopic level that will give rise to equilibration .",
    "it has been evaded by proposing the so called _ h - theorem _ which states that a system attains equilibrium when the entropy function is maximized over the accessible states of the system .",
    "although this has proved to be a very efficient way to calculate and work with equilibrium states , the heart of the problem remains unsolved .",
    "so we look at this thermodynamic problem from a quantum mechanical perspective .",
    "this is where quantum thermodynamics comes in .",
    "moreover , the concepts and laws of thermodynamics are presumably valid only in macroscopic regime . to see how the laws and definitions of thermodynamic quantities viz heat , work , etc behave in microscopic regime is another incentive that can be achieved through quantum thermodynamics .",
    "there has been a number of works @xcite where the problem of equilibration is looked at from a quantum mechanical perspective . for example , linden et al .",
    "@xcite looked into the problem of smallest possible quantum refrigerator . in the process , they considered a two - qubit system as a refrigerator in which one qubit acts as the system to be cooled while the other works as the coil of the refrigerator by extracting heat from the body ( to be cooled ) , and releasing it to the environment .",
    "the two - qubit refrigerator is derived from the steady state solution of a three - qubit master equation which the authors provided phenomenologically . instead of following this phenomenological approach , our aim is to identify a microscopic derivation of a master equation for the refrigeration . to proceed , we consider the notion of _ thermalizing hamiltonians _ for the individual qubits together with the three - qubit interaction hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately this , in general , is a formidable task .",
    "the solution may become tractable if one can come up with a thermalizing hamiltonian for the individual qubits where the thermalizing process maybe simulated through action of a few ancilla qubits .",
    "now , although master equations for a system to equilibrate are available , it remains a task to prescribe a hamiltonian that will give rise to equilibration . here",
    ", in this paper , we work out a thermalizing hamiltonian @xmath1 for the quantum - optical master equation @xcite which gives rise to thermal equilibration of a qubit .",
    "we find that a single - qubit ancilla is sufficient for such a system .",
    "moreover , we took two qubits each of which is already in contact with a separate single - qubit ancilla through @xmath1 and the qubits themselves are under the action of an interaction hamiltonian which is taken here ( for simplicity ) to be of the form @xmath1 .",
    "it is seen that the there exist cases where equlibration results in cooling of both the qubits or one of the qubits . by cooling , we mean a decrease in their thermal state temperatures .",
    "another model of thermalization ( for spin-@xmath6 systems ) has been developed by kleinbolting and klesse @xcite . in this work",
    ", they used the swap operation between system and bath to give rise to thermalization .",
    "but a drawback of this method is that the system is fully thermalized after a finite time interval , which is an unrealistic model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we first describe the thermalizing process of a qubit as a pin map .",
    "we then look at the optical master equation for a qubit to find out its time dependent solutions .",
    "the affine transformation relating the initial state and the time - evolved state is then described .",
    "this affine transformation is then parametrized to find out the thermalizing hamiltonian @xmath1 with a single - qubit ancilla simulating the heat bath . in section iii , we consider the total hamiltonian for four qubits  two qubits as ancilla and two system qubits which are also interacting via @xmath1 .",
    "considering the initial states of the ancilla qubits to be thermal states ( at different temperatures , in general ) , and considering different initial states of the system qubits , we then look at the time - evolved states of the system qubits for large enough time ( until the system qubits equilibrate ) .",
    "we then numerically look at the final steady state temperatures of the system qubits with different initial temperatures of the ancilla qubits , and consequently obtain different phase diagrams . in section",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "the starting point for our work is realising that thermalization can be achieved through several ways , one of which being markovian master equations .",
    "therefore , we take a markovian master equation , the quantum optical master equation , where a qubit ( two levels of an atom ) is in contact with a bath ( a radiation field ) .",
    "given the fact that all markovian master equations give rise to equilibration to _ thermal states _ @xmath7",
    "we try to figure out a hamiltonian which will do the same .",
    "this hamiltonian , which will henceforth be called as thermalizing hamiltonian @xmath1 will give rise to a unitary process where the system ( two levels of the atom ) will eventually reach a constant thermal state .    to calculate the thermalizing hamiltonian @xmath1",
    ", we find the affine transformation on the bloch vector of the system qubit that will give rise to the same evolution as the quantum optical master equation .",
    "on doing so , we realize that the affine transformation is a special case of generalized amplitude damping channel @xcite .",
    "we then refer to a result by narang and arvind @xcite where it is shown that it is enough for certain qubit channels to have a single - qubit mixed state ancilla .",
    "terhal et al @xcite have shown that certain single - qubit channels can only be simulated through qutrit mixed state environments .",
    "our affine transformation fits into the criterion for single - qubit ancilla as in narang et al @xcite and we find a two - qubit hamiltonian that simulates the evolution of the system qubit via the quantum optical master equation .    given below are the details of the aforesaid thermalzation process .",
    "we will be working in the computational basis unless mentioned otherwise .      before we introduce markovian master equations we look for the most general way a qubit can lead to thermalization  a qubit channel  a completely positive trace preserving map @xmath8 such that @xmath9 for all single - qubit @xmath10 .",
    "such a map is called _ pin _ map . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the set of all bounded linear operators @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath13 the kraus operator for @xmath14 are : @xmath15    @xmath16      we choose the following quantum optical master equation which corresponds to a qubit interacting with a bosonic thermal bath under markovian conditions .",
    "@xmath17    here , @xmath18 is the planck distribution .",
    "@xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 is temperature and @xmath21 is the energy at frequency @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the spontaneous emission rate of the bath and @xmath24 is the total emission rate ( including thermally induced emission and absorption processes ) .",
    "here we have neglected the free evolution part . for more details , refer to @xcite .",
    "if the initial system qubit state is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , the master equation can be readily solved by choosing the time - evolved state to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we find : @xmath29 here @xmath30 and also , @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "@xmath32 gives us a measure of the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "it can be easily seen that , higher the value of @xmath32 , lower the temperature and vice versa . specifically , @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . the steady state solution for the system is a thermal state as expected , and corresponds to the bloch vector @xmath37 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath38      any single - qubit channel can be written as an affine transformation of the form @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can express the corresponding affine transformation for our solution as a @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 and a column matrix @xmath42 :    @xmath43    @xmath44    here , we notice that this affine transformation is a special kind of generalized amplitude damping channel .",
    "amplitude damping channels describe the effect of energy dissipation to environment at finite temperature .",
    "the affine transformation for a generalized amplitude damping channel has two positive parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "it is given by : @xmath47 @xmath48    we can see that our thermalization process is a generalized amplitude damping channel with the parameter @xmath49",
    ".      in @xcite , narang and arvind used a single - qubit mixed state ancilla to parametrize the affine transformation of a single - qubit channel .",
    "we follow their technique to simulate our dynamical process for thermalization . to do so , we consider a single - qubit mixed state ancilla of the form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the maximally mixed state and @xmath52 is a general pure state given by , @xmath53    if @xmath54 act as a bath state for a single - qubit system then evolution through the most general two - qubit unitary @xmath55 will result in the following affine transformation for the system qubit .",
    "thus , the class of single - qubit channels which can be simulated by a single - qubit mixed state ancilla is a six parameter family ( @xmath56 ) of affine transformations :    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    one may notice a discrepancy with our closed form expressions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( given in equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ c ] ) ) and those given by equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in @xcite .",
    "this is because there seems to be slight error in the latter s calculation",
    ". please refer to appendix a for details of our calculation .",
    "it is also important to note here that by using the ancilla qubit , we are only simulating the dynamics of the system qubit leading to the infinite time thermalization .",
    "more specifically we do not have the ancilla state remaining static , as is the case for the bosonic bath",
    ". the ancilla state does in fact change .",
    "the next step is to compare the parametrized forms of m and c in equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ c ] ) respectively to the affine transformation of quantum optical master equation in ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "it is a fairly straightforward exercise and we get two sets of conditions on the parameters . corresponding to these , we get two separate joint unitaries giving rise to thermalization . but here , we consider only one of them ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "one can check that the unitary does indeed lead to thermalization in the infinite time limit .",
    "equivalently , this can also be seen by calculating the kraus operators for the system qubit from the joint unitary operator and then applying infinite time limit .",
    "@xmath60 now , the thermalizing hamiltonian can be found by using the following expression , @xmath61 the derivation of the above expession can be found in appendix b. @xmath1 takes the following form    @xmath62    where , @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "+ for more details of this calculation please refer to the appendix b.",
    "now that we have _ a _ thermalizing hamiltonian for a single - qubit , we can ask the question , what happens when two such qubits ( each being attached with its own mixed state ancilla qubit ) interact with each other ? what is the respective thermal behavior of the system qubits ?",
    "thus , instead of a three qubit system  as taken by linden _",
    "@xcite we consider the thermalization of a two - qubit interacting system to make things simpler . to look into this in more detail",
    ", we present the following scenario .    as depicted in the fig .",
    "1 , consider two qubits @xmath65 and @xmath45 interacting with their own respective single - qubit mixed state ancillae @xmath66 and @xmath67 through thermalizing hamiltonians @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also have the two qubits @xmath65 and @xmath45 interacting with each other through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath70 . as we see in appendix a",
    ", the bath qubits are initially in thermal states themselves . here , we choose @xmath71 and @xmath72 as the bloch vectors for the bath qubits @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively . as mentioned earlier , @xmath73 s are functions of their respective temperatures .",
    "thus , the initial states of bath qubits @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the following thermal states , @xmath74     and @xmath45 , which are associated with their individual bath qubits @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are interacting within themselves . ]",
    "is @xmath75 . ]",
    "the thermalizing hamiltonians @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given by , @xmath76 @xmath77 where , @xmath78 @xmath79 we consider a simple interaction hamiltonian @xmath70 and choose it in the same functional form as the thermalizing hamiltonian : @xmath80    where ,    @xmath81    so , now the total hamitonian is : @xmath82 here on , we will drop the subscript and simply refer to the total hamiltonian as @xmath83 .",
    "the time evolution operator is , @xmath84     is the maximally entangled state @xmath85 @xmath86 . ]     is a state slightly shifted from @xmath85 @xmath87 . ]",
    "are thermal states with @xmath88 . ]",
    "are thermal states with @xmath89 . ]",
    "are thermal states with @xmath90 . ]",
    "where , @xmath91 .    in order to calculate the explicit form of the time evolution operator , we need to diagonalize @xmath92 which is a @xmath93 matrix .",
    "it turns out that it is a sparse matrix of rank 12 .",
    "so we can project out the 4 dimensional null space such that we get the @xmath94 matrix instead .",
    "but even with this simplification , we end up having trouble to calculate the unitary matrix analytically .",
    "we therefore turn to numerical simulations .",
    "we write a program that allows us to plot the regions in which the system qubits @xmath65 and @xmath45 get heated or cooled as the initial bath temperatures are varied . here",
    ", heating / cooling is defined as the increase / decrease in the final qubit temperature as compared to their initial temperature , respectively . here",
    ", we use the fact that to any single - qubit state , we can always assign a temperature since every single - qubit state can be associated to an equivalent thermal state .    in the program ,",
    "we fix the initial state of the system qubits as joint pure states , thermal states , etc .",
    "then , for some fixed initial bath temperatures we evolve the four - qubit system under the unitary evolution to find the final state , typically for a time t=1000 @xcite , when equilibriation has occurred . then by assigning temperatures to the final qubit states , and thereby comparing with their corresponding initial temperatures ,",
    "we decipher whether heating or cooling has taken place and plotted accordingly .",
    "now , the bath temperatures are changed and the process is repeated .",
    "we see that , in principle , one or both of @xmath65 and @xmath45 can cool down to temperatures close to zero .",
    "finally , in the plots we have shown different regions of heating / cooling of the system qubits for different initial states of @xmath65 and @xmath45 ( with the x and y axes as the bath temperatures of @xmath67 and @xmath66 , respectively ) .",
    "also the interaction parameter @xmath95 is fixed for all the plots .",
    "parametric representation used for two - qubit pure states in the plots is :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "in this paper , we look at a markovian master equation of a qubit that leads to thermalization and simulate it through a unitary process , replacing the bath with a single - qubit mixed state ancilla .",
    "this enables us to take two such interacting single - qubit systems in contact with their respective baths .",
    "we see different phases of cooling and heating of the two systems .",
    "although , a markovian model of thermalization has been used here , there are nonmarkovian models too .",
    "these models need not necessarily be simulatable through a single - qubit ancilla ( mixed or pure ) . for example , we consider the case of post - markovian master equation as in @xcite and find that a single - qubit ancilla is not sufficient to simulate the thermalization process .",
    "note that not all non - markovian dynamics give rise to thermalization .",
    "for example , when qubit @xmath65 interacts with qubit @xmath45 under a hamiltonian of the form @xmath100 , the reduced dynamics of @xmath65 is non - markovian but it does not give rise to thermalization ( see appendix c ) . on the other hand , the thermalization process of maniscalco and petruccione @xcite is non - markovian .",
    "we expect that our result will stimulate further interest in finding out the fundamental dynamics that leads to thermalization ( for example , studying adiabaticity in open quantum systems ) . as an extension to this work , we hope to look into more general thermalization models ( even non - markovian ) which require two - qubit ancillae .",
    "also , finding similar thermalizing hamiltonian models for leaking cavity modes of radiation fields is an intriguing future project .",
    "* acknowledgement : * we would like to thank manik banik , arindam mallick , and george thomas for their valuable inputs .",
    "in this appendix , we will discuss the explicit calculations involved in parametrizing @xmath41 and @xmath42 matrices ( appeared in equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ c ] ) ) of the single - qubit channels simulatable through a single - qubit mixed state ancilla .      now recalling the form of the mixed state ancilla @xmath54 from equation ( [ rhoe ] ) and using an arbitrary initial state for the system qubit @xmath103",
    ", we can define the composite initial state , @xmath104 to find the final evolved state of the system qubit , we apply the unitary and then trace out the environment , @xmath105.\\ ] ]    now we can find out the components of @xmath106 in the basis @xmath107 by computing tr@xmath108 $ ] .",
    "thereby , we can read out the elements of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for example , consider @xmath109 , we get : @xmath110 = m_{31}n_1+m_{32}n_2+m_{33}n_3+c_3.\\ ] ] finally , after somewhat lengthy calculations we end up with the parametrized matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 given in the main paper . as mentioned earlier , these matrices differ slightly from those given in equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in reference @xcite .",
    "to find the thermalizing hamiltonian , we first need to find the values of the parameters that match our particular case . for this , we compare the affine transformation for the quantum optical case in equations ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) with the parametrized matrices in equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ c ] ) respectively .",
    "it can be easily seen that there exist , two sets of parameters that will work",
    ". we will consider just one of them for illustration : @xmath111 where @xmath112 can be arbitrary .",
    "so finally , we get the mixed state ancilla as the following thermal state , @xmath113    putting the values from equation ( [ set1 ] ) in the form of unitary given in equation ( [ ud ] ) , we get the unitary for the thermalization process . note that we now have a time dependent unitary , @xmath114 from here , we can calculate @xmath1 easily as follows .",
