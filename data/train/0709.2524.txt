    "the parametric dependence of an eigenvector of an operator often exhibits anholonomy in its phase  @xcite .",
    "a simple demonstration of the phase anholonomy in an eigenvector of a hamiltonian is shown by berry  @xcite : prepare the system to be in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , whose energy spectrum is assumed to be discrete and nondegenerate . during the adiabatic change of the parameters of the hamiltonian , which is kept to be nondegenerate along the change",
    ", the system continuously remains to be in an eigenstate of the instantaneous hamiltonian , according to the adiabatic theorem  @xcite .",
    "when the parameter returns to its initial value , after the adiabatic change along a closed path in the parameter space , the difference between the initial and the final state vectors is only in its phase , which is composed by two ingredients : one is called a dynamical phase that is determined by the accumulation of the eigenenergy along the adiabatic time evolution .",
    "the other is called a geometric phase , or the phase anholonomy that reflects the geometric structure of the family of eigenvectors in the parameter space .",
    "there is a non - abelian generalization of the phase anholonomy : this was pointed out by wilczek and zee in the parametric change of an eigenspace of a hamiltonian that has a spectral degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "the phase anholonomy appears in various fields of physics , besides quantum mechanics , and brings profound consequences  @xcite .",
    "recently , cheon found exotic anholonomies , which are completely different from the conventional phase anholonomy , in a family of systems with generalized pointlike potentials  @xcite .",
    "cheon s anholonomies appear , surprisingly , both in eigenenergies and eigenvectors : the trail of an eigenenergy along a change of parameters on a closed path that encircles a singularity does not draw a closed curve but , instead , a spiral .",
    "since the initial and the final eigenenergies in the closed path are different eigenvalues of a hermite operator , the corresponding eigenvectors must be orthogonal .",
    "hence the eigenenergy anholonomy induces another anholonomy in the direction of eigenvectors .",
    "the origin of cheon s anholonomies in the family of systems with the generalized pointlike potentials is identified with the geometrical structure of the family s parameter space  @xcite .    in order to distinguish cheon s anholonomy in the directions of eigenvectors from wilczek - zee s phase anholonomy , which requires a degenerate spectrum and transports an eigenvector into its nonorthogonal direction in general along adiabatic changes on closed paths",
    ", we will call the former an _ eigenspace anholonomy _ :",
    "wilczek - zee s phase anholonomy concerns the change of an eigenvector within a single and degenerate eigenspace and cheon s eigenspace anholonomy , which do not require spectral degeneracies , concerns the journey of an eigenvector from one eigenspace into another eigenspace .",
    "we can easily expect that cheon s anholonomies would bring profound consequences in various fields of physics , as is done by the phase anholonomy .",
    "for example , in the adiabatic ( sometimes referred to as born - oppenheimer  @xcite ) approximation  @xcite , it has been considered to be legitimate to assume that an adiabatic potential surface , which is an eigenvalue of an electronic hamiltonian with a frozen nuclear configuration , is a single - valued function of the nuclear configuration .",
    "the single - valuedness would be broken if cheon s eigenenergy anholonomy emerged .",
    "a similar question may be raised in the bloch theory in solid state physics  @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "cheon s anholonomies may be applied to manipulate quantum systems to transfer a quantum state adiabatically into another state , as is suggested by cheon  @xcite .",
    "the last point will be discussed more precisely in this paper .",
    "however , all known examples of the eigenenergy anholonomy , up to now , require an exotic connection condition around a singular potential  @xcite . hence it is still worth to find systems that exhibit cheon s anholonomies .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show cheon s anholonomies in periodically driven systems .",
    "more precisely , we will discuss quasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies with respect to floquet operators that describe unit time evolutions of the periodically driven systems .",
    "first , we provide an instance of a quantum map , i.e. , a quantum system under a periodically pulsed perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the floquet operators of quantum maps allows us a thorough analysis . in order to prepare it , the parametric dependence , induced by the change of the strength of the perturbation , of eigenvectors of the floquet operators of quantum maps is reviewed in section  [ sec : adiabatictransport ] . in section  [ sec : rank1 ] , a quantum map that is perturbed by a rank-@xmath0 operator is introduced .",
    "the details of its properties are explained in appendices  [ sec : normalform ] and  [ sec : cyclicity ] . in section  [ sec : existance ] , it is shown that the rank-@xmath0 perturbation , with respect to the original floquet operator , enables us to introduce a family of floquet operators to realize cheon s anholonomies .",
    "several examples are shown in section[sec : examples ] .",
    "second , the stability of the anholonomies is examined .",
    "a geometrical analysis , which is shown in section  [ sec : abundance ] , of the family of floquet operators elucidates that the appearance of cheon s anholonomies is not restricted in the periodically pulsed systems and is also possible in periodically driven systems in general .",
    "furthermore , we may claim that cheon s anholonomies are abundant in systems whose time evolutions are described by floquet operators . among possible consequences and applications of our result , section  [ sec : manipulation ] provides a discussion on a design principle on quantum state manipulations along adiabatic passages .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] provides a discussion and a summary .",
    "a part of the present result was briefly announced in ref .",
    "to prepare our analysis of quantum maps , we review the parametric motions of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of floquet operators and the adiabatic theorem for periodically driven systems .",
    "let us consider a periodically pulsed driven system ( with a period @xmath1 ) described by the `` kicked '' hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe the `` free '' motion and the pulsed perturbation , respectively , and @xmath5 is the strength of the perturbation . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the stroboscopic description of the state vector @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath6 is described by the quantum map @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a floquet operator  @xcite . in the following , we set @xmath10 . in order to show a simple example of the parametric motions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors",
    ", we assume that the spectrum of @xmath11 contains only discrete components and has no degeneracy .",
    "at the same time , in order to avoid subtle issues that are brought from the infinite dimensionality of the hilbert space @xmath12  @xcite , we assume that @xmath13 is finite .",
    "this assumption does no harm to the descriptions of many systems where an appropriate introduction of the truncation of the hilbert space is feasible .    since @xmath11 ( [ eq : defulambda ] )",
    "is unitary , its eigenvalues @xmath14 are complex and on the unit circle , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the phase of @xmath16 indicates the increment of the dynamical phase during the unit time evolution whose initial state is the corresponding eigenstate @xmath17 .",
    "the time - average of the dynamical phase determines a quasienergy @xmath18 $ ] ( or , @xmath19 ) .",
    "note that the value of quasienergy has an ambiguity because of the period @xmath20 in the quasienergy space .",
    "we remark that the eigenvalue equation @xmath21 determines the eigenvalue and the eigenvector only pointwise in @xmath5 . by assuming the continuity about @xmath5",
    ", we obtain the derivatives of @xmath22 and @xmath17  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath17 is assumed to be normalized and @xmath24 is a geometric gauge potential  @xcite .",
    "these derivatives compose a set of equations of motion for a virtual time @xmath5  @xcite . with a given `` initial condition '' of @xmath25 , at @xmath26",
    ", we may integrate the equations of motion  ( [ eq : leveldynamics ] ) and ( [ eq : vectordynamics ] ) .",
    "note that , under the presence of anholonomy  @xcite , the single - valuedness of the solution @xmath25 generally holds only locally in the parameter space of @xmath5 .",
    "the adiabatic theorem  @xcite for periodically driven systems  @xcite provides a physical significance of the geometry ( i.e. , @xmath5-dependence ) of @xmath17 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath5 , which is supposed to be slowly changed , is the strength of the perturbation that is applied periodically : @xmath5 will be changed from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , during the @xmath29 steps , where the corresponding time interval is @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the value of @xmath5 at the @xmath32-th step ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in particular @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the slowness of the change of the parameter is expressed by the condition @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "we start with an initial condition that , at @xmath38 , the system is in an eigenstate @xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "the final state @xmath41 is @xmath42     { |{}\\xi_n({\\lambda_{\\rm i}}){}\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 represents a time - orderd ( or , equivalently , path - orderd ) product .",
    "according to the adiabatic theorem , the final state will converge to @xmath44 as @xmath37 , except its phase . in the following",
    ", we will evaluate the phase of the final state . from the equation of motion  ( [ eq : vectordynamics ] ) , we have @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "according to the adiabatic theorem  @xcite , we need only the first term above for the evaluation of the phase .",
    "hence we have @xmath47 as @xmath37 .",
    "the first and the second terms in the phase factor correspond to the dynamical and geometric phases , respectively  @xcite .",
    "in order to demonstrate the simplest example of cheon s anholonomies in quantum maps , we employ a rank-@xmath0 perturbation @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defulambda ] ) with a normalized vector @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath4 satisfies @xmath50 , the quantum map  ( [ eq : defulambda ] ) has a periodicity about @xmath5 .",
    "this is shown by an expansion of @xmath11 in @xmath4 , @xmath51 which has a @xmath52 periodicity in @xmath5 .",
    "hence the parameter space of @xmath5 is identified with a circle @xmath53 .",
    "we will discuss the parametric motion of quasienergies and eigenvectors of @xmath11 , along the changes of @xmath5 on @xmath53 .",
    "two kinds of `` trivial '' eigenvectors of @xmath11 are shown in order to simplify the later analysis on cheon s anholonomies .",
    "for the first kind , we suppose that an eigenvector @xmath54 of @xmath55 is orthogonal to @xmath49 and the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath56 .",
    "then , this implies that @xmath54 is also an eigenvector of @xmath11 for all @xmath5 and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath57 where we used @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : normalform ] , we will show that such trivial eigenvectors  ( [ eq : orthotriviall ] ) are created by a spectral degeneracy of @xmath11 .",
    "for the second kind , we suppose that @xmath49 is an eigenvector of @xmath55 and the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath56 .",
    "if this is the case , all the eigenvectors of @xmath55 , except @xmath49 , are orthogonal to @xmath49 , and accordingly become trivial eigenvectors of the first kind mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , @xmath49 is also a trivial one in the sense that @xmath49 is an eigenvector of @xmath11 for all @xmath5 .",
    "this is because @xmath60 where the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath61 depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of the two kinds of trivial eigenvectors are completed .    in the following ,",
    "we assume the absence of these trivial eigenvectors since they are irrelevant to the later argument to look for cheon s anholonomies . a systematic procedure to reduce a hilbert space by excluding these trivial eigenvectors of @xmath11",
    "is explained in appendix  [ sec : normalform ] .",
    "on the reduced hilbert space @xmath12 , it is assured that the spectrum of @xmath11 has no degeneracies for all @xmath5 . in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath49 , this assumption turns out to be equivalent to the following two conditions .",
    "( i ) the spectrum of @xmath62 is nondegenerate .",
    "note that we have already introduced another assumption that the spectrum of @xmath62 contains only discrete and a finite number of components to assure the smoothness of the parametric dependence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors on @xmath5 in section  [ sec : adiabatictransport ] .",
    "( ii ) @xmath49 is not orthogonal to any eigenvector of @xmath62 , otherwise the reduction is not complete .",
    "note that ( ii ) implies that @xmath49 is not any eigenvector of @xmath62 .",
    "thus the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) guarantee , for all @xmath5 , @xmath63 where either the lower or the upper bound of the equalities would hold if any trivial eigenvector remains .",
    "the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are further paraphrased with the help of the notion _ cyclicity _",
    "@xcite , when we restrict ourselves to the dimensionality of the hilbert space @xmath12 being finite . if @xmath62 and @xmath49 satisfy @xmath64  @xcite , @xmath49 is called a cyclic vector for @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "it is shown in appendix  [ sec : cyclicity ] , the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are equivalent to ( i ) @xmath62 has a cyclic vector and ( ii ) @xmath49 is a cyclic vector for @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "we will discuss the case that these assumptions are broken in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "what happens to the quasienergies and the eigenvectors when we adiabatically increase @xmath5 by @xmath52 , the period of the floquet operator  ( [ eq : expandulambda ] ) , and its spectrum , starting from @xmath65 ?",
    "the argument above suggests that we may have a conventional ( abelian ) phase anholonomy that appears only in the phase of the eigenvectors .",
    "however , the following argument will elucidate that we meet cheon s anholonomies in quasienergies as well as in eigenspaces .",
    "first , we examine quasienergies @xmath22 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "note that we have @xmath67 cases to choose `` the ground quasienergy '' due to the periodicity in the quasienergy space .",
    "once we choose a ground state , whose quantum number is assigned to @xmath68 , the quantum number @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is assigned so that @xmath22 increases as @xmath69 increases . more precisely , in order to remove ambiguities due to the periodicity in the quasienergies , we choose the branch of the quasienergies , at @xmath65 , as @xmath71 holds , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to the same eigenvalue @xmath74 . for brevity",
    ", we identify a quantum number @xmath69 with @xmath75 .",

    ". since @xmath4 satisfies @xmath50 , the eigenvalues of @xmath4 are only @xmath68 and @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly we have @xmath85 . however , the equalities for the minimum and the maximum can not hold because of @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_xi ] ) ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath88 and accordingly @xmath89 this imposes a restriction @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantizedde0 ] ) .",
    "in particular , neither @xmath91 nor @xmath67 is possible .",
    "namely , the quasienergy @xmath80 arrives at @xmath81 ( @xmath90 ) , instead of @xmath76 , as @xmath83 .",
    "this is nothing but a manifestation of cheon s anholonomy in quasienergy .    if the system is two - level ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , the above argument immediately implies @xmath93 .",
    "hence it is straightforward to show that @xmath94 holds for all @xmath95 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : quasienergyanholonomyrank1 ] ) remains true for @xmath96 .",
    "its justification requires one to examine a sum rule on @xmath97 : @xmath98 where we used @xmath99 for @xmath48 with normalized @xmath49 .",
    "the sum rule  ( [ eq : sumrulerank1 ] ) implies that eq .",

    "actually , if we assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq : quasienergyanholonomyrank1 ] ) is broken for some @xmath69 , e.g. , @xmath102 with @xmath103 , this contradicts with the sum rule  ( [ eq : sumrulerank1 ] ) .",
    "thus the quasienergy anholonomy  ( [ eq : quasienergyanholonomyrank1 ] ) for @xmath67-level quantum maps under the rank-1 perturbation is revealed completely .",
    "the quasienergy anholonomy  ( [ eq : quasienergyanholonomyrank1 ] ) induces an eigenspace anholonomy , which is expressed by projectors : @xmath104 note that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are orthogonal , since the corresponding eigenvalues are different .",
    "finally , we show an anholonomy in a state vector as a result of the adiabatic increment of @xmath5 by the period @xmath52 from @xmath65 .",
    "when the initial state is prepared to be an eigenstate @xmath107 , the corresponding final state is @xmath108 if we keep the adiabatic increment of @xmath5 , the state vector will become parallel with the eigenvector @xmath109 of @xmath55 after the completion of the @xmath82-th iteration of the periodic increment and return to the initial eigenstate at the end of the @xmath67-th iteration .",

    "as an application of the quasienergy anholonomy , a design principle of systems that achieve manipulations of quantum states with adiabatic passages is proposed . before describing our argument , we mention that the conventional works on the application of adiabatic passages to the manipulation of quantum states are the textbook results  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", there are interesting proposals on quantum circuits whose elementary operations are composed by adiabatic processes  @xcite .",
    "the reason why the adiabatic processes are employed is that the operations governed by the adiabatic processes are expected to be stable . on the other hand ,",
    "the manipulation that involves the phase anholonomy is expected to be stable under the perturbation , due to its topological nature .",
    "our scheme proposed here also relies on the adiabatic processes and employs nonconventional , cheon s anholonomies in quantum maps .",
    "the aim is to evolve a quantum state ( `` the initial target '' ) into another state ( `` the final target '' ) .",
    "what we need to carry it out is twofold : one is an `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian @xmath3 , whose eigenstates must contain the two target states .",
    "the other is a normalized vector @xmath49 , which must have nonzero overlappings between the two target states . under the influence of a periodically pulsed perturbation @xmath157 with its period @xmath1 and strength @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is described by the kicked hamiltonian @xmath158  ( [ eq : kickedhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the use of the quasienergy anholonomy of the corresponding floquet operator @xmath11  ( [ eq : defulambda ] ) is straightforward if @xmath3 is bounded and contains only discrete eigenenergies and @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the difference between the maximum and the minimum eigenenergies of @xmath3 . otherwise , we need to achieve these conditions effectively , by adjusting @xmath49 .",

    "we remark that an application of the present procedure to anholonomic adiabatic quantum computation is described in a separate publication  @xcite .    the strongest limitations of the present scheme , in our opinion ,",
    "is that the target states for the manipulation must be eigenstates of @xmath3 .",
    "superpositions of the eigenstates of @xmath3 can not be the targets due to the presence of dynamical phases that generally diverge in adiabatic processes .",
    "note that , however , there is no obstacle to handle `` superposed states '' when they are eigenstates of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , if we could introduce cheon s anholonomies to the systems whose quasienergy are degenerate , it may be possible to carry out a coherent manipulation within a degenerate eigenspace .",
    "this motivates us to seek an extension of the eigenspace anholonomy for degenerate eigenspace , i.e. , cheon s anholonomies  la wilczek and zee .",
    "we have discussed cheon s anholonomies in a family of quantum map  ( [ eq : expandulambda ] ) with a rank - one projection @xmath4 .",
    "although our geometrical argument in section  [ sec : abundance ] assures the abundance of the systems that exhibit the anholonomies , we still do not have any systematic way to find such systems , except the quantum map  ( [ eq : expandulambda ] ) . in order to suggest exploring other examples of the anholonomies , we summarize conditions to find the anholonomies . two ingredients in our floquet operator  ( [ eq : expandulambda ] ) facilitate us to find the anholonomies : ( a ) the periodicity of the floquet operator for the parameter @xmath5 enforces the periodicity of the spectrum ; and ( b ) the positivity of the perturbation assures the monotonic increment of each quasienergy for the increment of @xmath5 .",
    "these two facts imply that @xmath22 arrives at a higher excited quasienergy @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) after an increment of @xmath5 by the period @xmath52 .",
    "to realize the first condition , @xmath4 needs not to be a projection operator . for the floquet operator  ( [ eq : defulambda ] ) , the condition for the periodicity is @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the period . in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath166 of @xmath4 ,",
    "this condition is that @xmath167 is an integer for all @xmath69 .",

    "the value of @xmath168 could be determined by the geometric argument shown in section  [ sec : abundance ] .",

    "first , we introduce @xmath172 , which is a subspace of @xmath170 and orthogonal to @xmath49 : @xmath173 we exclude @xmath172 , since this is a trivial eigenspace of @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : orthotriviall ] ) ) .",
    "if the remainder @xmath174 is not @xmath175 , @xmath176 is a one - dimensional eigenspace of @xmath55 .",

    "then we examine the spectrum of @xmath11 on the resultant hilbert space @xmath177 . on @xmath12",
    ", @xmath55 has a pure point and nondegenerate spectrum . at the same time",
    ", all of the eigenvector @xmath54 of @xmath55 satisfies @xmath178 for general @xmath5 , we assume that @xmath11 also has a pure point spectrum .",
    "namely , we exclude the case that @xmath11 has a continuous spectrum , which emerges under some combinations of @xmath55 and @xmath49 in an infinite dimensional @xmath12  @xcite . as a result of the reduction of @xmath12 , any eigenvector @xmath54 of @xmath11",
    "also satisfies the inequality  ( [ eq : v_phi ] ) .",
    "hence we proved the inequality  ( [ eq : v_xi ] ) in the main text .",
    "when a hilbert space @xmath179 , which is induced by a vector @xmath49 and an operator @xmath180 , agrees with the whole hilbert space , @xmath49 is called a cyclic vector of @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "the notion of the cyclicity is useful to discuss how we choose @xmath49 in the quantum map  ( [ eq : expandulambda ] ) to find cheon s anholonomies , as is explained in sections  [ sec : rank1 ] to  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "hence a review of the cyclicity is shown below , where we assume that the spectrum of @xmath180 has only discrete and finite components .",
    "a characterization of the cyclic vector @xmath49 for @xmath180 is explained : any ( normalizable ) eigenvector @xmath54 of @xmath180 satisfies @xmath181 . to show this ,",
    "let @xmath171 be the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath54 .",
    "due to the cyclicity , @xmath54 is a linear combination of @xmath182 , i.e. , @xmath183 with appropriate coefficients @xmath184 .",
    "hence we have @xmath185 .",
    "since @xmath186 is nonzero and @xmath187 is finite , we conclude @xmath188 .",

    "next , we show that the inverse holds , i.e. , the condition ( ii ) implies the condition ( ii ) when the spectrum of @xmath180 is nondegenerate .",
    "more precisely , when all eigenvectors @xmath54 of @xmath180 satisfy @xmath189 , @xmath49 is a cyclic vector for @xmath180 . to show this , we prove that @xmath190 are linearly independent , where @xmath67 is the number of the eigenvalues .",

    "let @xmath194 and @xmath195 denote an eigenvalue of @xmath180 and the corresponding eigenvector , respectively ( @xmath196 ) . from eq .",

    "accordingly we encounter a vandermonde determinant @xmath204 and we have @xmath205 due to the absence of spectrum degeneracy of @xmath180 .",
    "hence we have @xmath193 .",
    "we can now examine the condition when @xmath180 has a cyclic vector to see the correspondence between the conditions ( i ) and ( i ) in section  [ sec : rank1 ] . if the spectrum of @xmath180 is nondegenerate , @xmath180 has a cyclic vector , e.g. , @xmath206 , from the above discussion .",
    "furthermore , @xmath180 has a cyclic vector only when @xmath180 has no degenerate eigenvalue . to show the latter , we examine its contraposition",
    "hence we assume that @xmath180 has a degenerate eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath207 .",

    "accordingly , with any vector @xmath49 , we have @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath214 is linearly dependent and any @xmath49 can not be a cyclic vector for @xmath180 .",
    "thus the degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath180 leads to an absence of its cyclic vector .    to summarize this appendix",
