    "one of the most favored candidates for the dark matter ( dm ) , that constitutes roughly a quarter of the mass - energy density of the universe  @xcite , is some kind of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with masses typically between a few gev and a few tev .",
    "such particles are predicted in many models of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics such as models involving supersymmetry or higher ( spatial ) dimensional theories  @xcite .",
    "owing to their weak interactions , such particles would  freeze out \" in the early universe at a characteristic temperature scale of @xmath0 mev , and would be present in the universe today as ` cold ' dark matter with a calculable abundance that can naturally explain the measured average cosmological density of dark matter in the universe .",
    "also , the measured rotation curves of spiral galaxies , such as that of our own , the milky way , out to and beyond their visible edges , can be explained naturally under the hypothesis that the visible galaxies are embedded in much larger , roughly spherical , dark matter `` halos '' .",
    "the true extents and the masses of such halos are , however , unknown .    following early suggestions  @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) , several experiments worldwide are currently engaged in attempts to directly detect these hypothetical wimp dm particles comprising the dm halo of the milky way ( the galaxy , hereafter ) in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "these direct detection experiments attempt to detect nuclear recoils resulting from interaction of wimps with a suitably chosen target material in underground laboratory detectors with low backgrounds .",
    "the dama / nai  @xcite and dama / libra  @xcite experiments ( hereafter together simply referred to as the  dama \" collaboration ) have reported an annual modulation signal in their event rate at a confidence level of @xmath3 based on their combined data  @xcite .",
    "they interpret this as evidence for wimps , ascribing the modulation to the periodic variation of the flux of wimps passing through the detector on earth caused by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "the cdms - ii collaboration  @xcite has also reported two candidate events in their  signal region \" with an estimated probability of @xmath0 23% of observing 2 or more background events in that region , for the estimated level of the background .",
    "several other experiments such as cresst  @xcite , xenon10  @xcite , coupp  @xcite and picasso  @xcite , for example , have reported only null results so far .",
    "these results provide important constraints on the wimp mass and wimp - nucleon interaction cross section .",
    "the question of compatibility of the dama results  @xcite with the negative results from other experiments has also been the subject of several recent studies which include the earlier overlooked effect of  ion channeling \" ( see below ) on the analysis of the dama results  @xcite .    in order to derive constraints on ( or to determine ) the mass and interaction cross section of the unknown wimp dm particles from the results of these direct detection experiments ,",
    "one requires the density and velocity distribution of the wimps in the solar neighborhood as crucial input parameters .",
    "these parameters are _ a priori _ unknown . in the customary analysis the dm halo of the galaxy",
    "is assumed to be described by a single component isothermal sphere  @xcite with a maxwellian velocity distribution in the galactic rest frame given by f(,)d^3=4()^v^2 dv .",
    "[ eq : maxwellian ] here @xmath4 ,   @xmath5 is the density at the location @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "the justification for this maxwellian form comes from the work of lynden - bell  @xcite who argued that evolution of systems of collisionless particles ( such as wimps ) under the process of gravitational collapse is governed by the process of `` violent relaxation '' whereby the observationally relevant ` coarse - grained ' phase space distribution function ( df ) of the system rapidly relaxes , due to collective effects , to a quasi - maxwellian stationary state which is a steady - state solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation .    the dm density in the solar neighborhood is usually taken to be @xmath8 , following the analysis of the observed velocity distribution of stars transverse to the galactic disk near the sun , as suggested by oort  @xcite and extended by bahcall  @xcite . a recent  model - independent \" analytical study  @xcite quotes @xmath9 . also , a recent attempt to directly extract this density from the results of cosmological large n - body simulations yields a value of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the last reference also finds a dm particle velocity distribution that can in general be called ",
    "quasi - maxwellian \" , albeit with significant deviation from the pure maxwellian form especially at the high velocity end where it drops off more sharply compared to the pure maxwellian .",
    "the value of the velocity dispersion , @xmath7 , the single parameter that characterizes the maxwellian velocity distribution ( [ eq : maxwellian ] ) of the dm particles , is usually determined from the relation  @xcite , @xmath11 , between the velocity dispersion of the particles constituting a single - component self - gravitating isothermal sphere and the asymptotic value of the circular rotation speed , @xmath12 , of a test particle in the gravitational field of the isothermal sphere .",
    "neglecting the effect of the visible matter on the dm halo , and assuming @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the measured value of the circular rotation velocity of the galaxy in the solar neighborhood , one gets @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite , which would imply a correspondingly higher value of @xmath16 .",
    "] this isothermal sphere model of the dm halo with a value of the dm velocity dispersion @xmath17 and local value of the dm density @xmath18 is what is often referred to as the _ standard halo model _ ( shm ) .",
    "this shm is generally taken as a sort of benchmark model of the dm halo of the galaxy , and the results of various wimp dm search experiments are mostly analyzed within the context of this shm .    whereas the shm would suffice for the initial design of the experiments , it is necessary to consider improved models to analyze the results of the experiments , which are becoming progressively more sophisticated .",
    "the reasons for this are many : ( 1 )  it is well - known that the isothermal sphere has a mass that linearly increases with its radius @xmath19 and tends to @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , such a system can not represent a realistic dm halo of finite physical size .",
    "( 2 )  the rotational speed in the isothermal sphere model increases linearly for small @xmath19 , has an oscillatory dependence on @xmath19 for intermediate @xmath19 , and tends to a constant only asymptotically as @xmath22 .",
    "thus there is no strict reason why @xmath12 should be equal to @xmath14 .",
    "( 3 )  more importantly , the presence of the visible matter further complicates the situation ; it contributes significantly to balancing the centrifugal forces of rotation at the solar circle .",
    "the density profile of an isothermal sphere is obtained as the solution to a second - order non - linear differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions at the origin .",
    "thus the presence of a significant amount of visible matter within the solar circle will substantially change the nature of the solutions .",
    "( 4 )  it is a common practice , in the context of the phenomenology of dm direct detection experiments , to truncate the speed distribution ( [ eq : maxwellian ] ) at some chosen value of the local ( solar neighborhood ) escape speed @xmath23 ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is not in general a self - consistent procedure because the resulting  truncated maxwellian \" speed distribution will not necessarily be a solution of the steady - state collisionless boltzmann equation appropriate for a finite physical system . in addition , since the rotation curve for such a truncated maxwellian will not in general be asymptotically flat , the relation @xmath11 used to determine the value of @xmath7 in the maxwellian speed distribution of the isothermal sphere , as done in the shm , will not be valid .",
    "however , there are indeed well understood procedures that allow truncation of the dm halo at a finite radius and the velocity distribution at appropriate limits in a self - consistent manner .    in this paper",
    "we construct a self - consistent model of the phase - space structure of the finite - size dm halo of the galaxy , and study its implications for the analysis of the results of the direct detection experiments .",
    "the model is based on describing the phase - space df of the dm particles in the halo by the so - called  lowered \" ( or truncated ) isothermal models ( often called  king models \" )  @xcite , which are proper self - consistent solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation representing nearly isothermal systems of finite physical size and mass . at every location @xmath6 within the system",
    "a dm particle can have speeds up to a maximum speed @xmath24 , which is self - consistently determined by the model itself .",
    "a particle of velocity @xmath24 at @xmath6 within the system can just reach its outer boundary , generally called the truncation radius , where the dm density by construction vanishes .",
    "note that this maximum speed @xmath25 is not the same as the escape speed @xmath23 , which is defined as the speed required for a particle to escape from the given location out to infinity .",
    "the escape speed is always larger than the maximum speed . for a king model dm halo of finite size ,",
    "it is the maximum speed and not the escape speed that is relevant in considerations of direct detection experiments .",
    "as we shall see below , the speed distribution of the particles constituting a lowered isothermal model can be described as  quasi - maxwellian \" not unlike what is seen in recent simulations  @xcite . apart from taking into account the finite size of the dm halo ,",
    "we also explicitly account for the mutual gravitational interaction between the visible matter and the dm , as this interaction influences both the density profile and the velocity distribution of the dark matter particles .",
    "when the visible matter density is set to zero and the truncation radius is set to infinity , our halo model becomes identical to that of a single - component isothermal sphere used in the shm .",
    "the model we develop here is along the lines described in earlier formulations   which included the effects of the gravitation of the visible matter on the dark matter in a self - consistent manner .",
    "stated simply , these models account for the fact that the dm particles move in a gravitational potential to which both the visible matter and the dark matter make contributions . as the distribution of the visible matter",
    "may be fixed from observations , the parameters of the self - consistent velocity distribution function of the dm particles in presence of the visible matter can be determined by comparing the theoretically derived rotation curve with the observed rotation curve of the galaxy .",
    "the velocity distribution function so determined is then used in the calculation of the direct detection rates .    of particular interest in this context",
    "is the rotation curve recently reported by xue et al  @xcite , which extends up to a galactocentric distance of @xmath26 .",
    "this rotation curve is derived from the kinematics of a sample of @xmath0 2400 blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) stars taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr6",
    "@xcite database .",
    "a noticeable feature of this rotation curve is that it gently falls from the adopted value at the sun s location , @xmath27 , to @xmath28 at @xmath26 .",
    "it is of considerable interest to study the implications of such a rotation curve for the direct detection experiments . in this paper , therefore , we use this new rotation curve for determining the parameters of our halo model .    for the isothermal sphere model of the dm halo , the main effect of the gravitational influence of the visible matter on the structure of the dm halo",
    "is to shrink its ` core radius '  @xcite , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the central density  .",
    "this is because the dm is  pulled in \" by the visible matter , increasing its effective central density .",
    "thus the characteristic core radius of an isothermal dm distribution in presence of the visible matter is less than that of an isolated isothermal sphere whose properties are determined by its own gravity alone . the same , as we show below , is true for the lowered isothermal models .",
    "a related effect is the relative enhancement of the dm density near the plane of the disk due to additional gravitational influence of the disk .",
    "these effects are further discussed in the following section .",
    "we find that , for our best - fit halo model with parameter values @xmath31 and truncation radius @xmath32 , that provides the best fit to the rotation curve data of ref .",
    "@xcite , the null result of the cdms - ii experiment  @xcite , for example , gives a 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the wimp - nucleon spin - independent ( si ) cross section of @xmath33 for a wimp mass of @xmath0 71 gev .",
    "we also study the issue of compatability of the claimed positive signal reported by the dama collaboration with the null results from the other experiments using , for illustration , the dama collaboration s original 2-bin annual modulation amplitude data . we find that for our best - fit halo model , there exists a region of the wimp mass ( @xmath34 ) vs.  wimp - nucleon spin - independent ( si ) cross section ( @xmath35 ) parameter space bounded by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , within which the dama s claimed modulation signal is compatible with the null results of other experiments . similar  dama - compatible \" regions of small wimp masses obtain also for spin - dependent interactions . we , however , recognize that a more rigorous analysis using dama bins over smaller intervals should be able to better constrain the dama region within the context of our halo model , a task that we will take up in a subsequent work .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sec : kingmodel ] we describe our model of the dark halo of the galaxy that includes in a self - consistent manner the gravitational effect of the observed visible matter on the structure of dark matter halo .",
    "the parameters of the model are determined by fitting the theoretically calculated rotation curves to a recently determined extended rotation curve of the galaxy up to @xmath38 .",
    "the shapes of the dark matter density and mass profiles and the velocity distribution function of the dm particles are also derived .",
    "the implications of our model for the analysis of the results of wimp direct detection experiments including the question of compatibility of dama s claimed positive signal with the null results of other experiments , are studied in section [ sec : dd_implications ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary_conclusions ] summarizes the main results of this paper and concludes .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to only elastic scattering of wimps from nuclei due to spin - independent ( si ) as well as spin - dependent ( sd ) wimp - nucleus interactions .",
    "the maxwellian velocity distribution ( [ eq : maxwellian ] ) used in the shm is simply related to the phase - space df of the isothermal sphere  @xcite , f_is ( , ) = f(e ) = , [ eq : iso_df ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the total energy ( per unit mass ) of the dm particle , @xmath41 being the total gravitational potential with the boundary condition @xmath42 , so that the density at any point @xmath6 is _ is()=f_is ( , ) d^3= _ 0 , [ eq : rhoeq ] where @xmath30 is the central density .",
    "the isothermal sphere described by df ( [ eq : iso_df ] ) is infinite in extent with a divergent total mass , and is characterized by two parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath30 .    to describe  nearly isothermal \" systems of finite size and finite total mass",
    ", one must have , in addition to the above two parameters of the isothermal sphere , a parameter that characterizes the finite size of the system .",
    "this is accomplished in king models by taking the df to be of the following form  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the so - called  relative energy \" and @xmath46 the  relative potential \"  @xcite .",
    "the three ( constant ) parameters of the system are @xmath47 ( with dimension of density ) , @xmath43 ( with dimension of velocity ) and the new parameter @xmath48 ( with dimension of potential or squared velocity ) which is related to the finite size of the system ( see below ) .    the density at any position @xmath6 is obtained by integrating @xmath49 over all velocities giving _ k ( ) & = & _ 0^ dv 4v^2 + & = & _ 1 , [ eq : king_density ] which satisfies the poisson equation ^2 ( ) = - ^2 ( ) = 4 g _ k ( ) .",

    "the king models approach the isothermal sphere solution at small radii @xmath51 , but have density profiles that fall off faster than that of the isothermal sphere at large radii ( which makes the total mass finite )",
    ". indeed , the density vanishes at @xmath52 , the truncation radius where @xmath53 , representing the outer edge of the system .",
    "this is ensured by choosing = ( r_t ) , ( r_t)=-(r_t ) + = 0 .",
    "[ eq : rt_mathcalc_reln ] as evident from equation ( [ eq : rt_mathcalc_reln ] ) , the parameter @xmath48 fixes the finite size ( @xmath54 ) of the system .",
    "actually , the king models form a sequence , each model being parametrized by the value of the  concentration parameter \" @xmath55 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the sequence of king models goes over into the isothermal sphere in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "note that the usual escape speed , @xmath23 , defined as @xmath57 $ ] is related to the maximum speed @xmath24 defined by equation ( [ eq : vmax ] ) through the relation ^2()&=2()=2 + & = ^2 ( ) - 2m()/ , [ eq : vescp_vmax_reln ] where @xmath58 is the mass contained within @xmath59 , with , so that @xmath60 is a non - zero positive constant . ]",
    "@xmath61 $ ] .",
    "note also that , unlike in the case of the ( infinite ) isothermal sphere , the parameter @xmath43 in the king models is _ not _ equal to the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the particles constituting the system ; the latter can be calculated for the df given above and is a function of @xmath19 , vanishing at @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , unlike in the case of the maxwellian df for which the velocity dispersion is linearly related to the most probable speed of the particles of the system , there is no simple relation between the velocity dispersion and the most probable speed of the particles of the system described by a skewed velocity distribution such as that described by the king df ( [ eq : king_df ] ) , and as such , the velocity dispersion has no special significance and does not uniquely specify the full df of the king model .    in the subsequent discussions we shall take the king model df ( [ eq : king_df ] ) as the df of the dm particles constituting the finite - size dm halo of the galaxy , _ in the rest frame of the galaxy _",
    "( the subscript k will be dropped for convenience ) .    for a  pure \" dm halo of finite size represented by the df ( [ eq : king_df ] ) without including the gravitational influence of the visible matter embedded within the halo , the gravitational potential @xmath62 in the above equations",
    "can be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the spherically symmetric self - gravitational potential of the pure dm halo represented by the df ( [ eq : king_df ] ) .",
    "in reality , however , a test particle sees the total gravitational potential of both the dm and the visible matter embedded within the dm halo .",
    "thus , we should write ( ) = ( ) + ( ) , [ eq : phitotal ] where now @xmath65 represents the contribution of the dm component to the total gravitational potential _ in presence of the visible matter _ , and @xmath66 is the gravitational potential of the observed visible matter of the galaxy .",
    "these potentials satisfy their respective poisson equations ^2()=4 g ( ) , ^2()=4 g ( ) , [ eq : poisson_eqns ] where the dm density is ( ) = _ 1 , [ eq : rhodm_eqn ] with ( ) = - , [ eq : psi_eqn ] using ( [ eq : rt_mathcalc_reln ] ) , and @xmath67 is the known visible matter density of the galaxy .",
    "note that in presence of the visible matter , whose spatial distribution is non - spherically symmetric , the dm spatial distribution and hence its gravitational potential will also be non - spherically symmetric in general .",
    "however , for large enough values of the truncation radius ( @xmath54 ) of the halo ( more specifically , for @xmath54 large compared to the visible matter disk s scale length  the latter being @xmath0 few kpc ; see below ) , both @xmath65 and @xmath66 become close to spherically symmetric at @xmath68 , which we also see in our numerical calculations described below . on the other hand , as already mentioned in footnote 3 in section [ sec : intro ] , the velocity distribution will be assumed to remain isotropic .",
    "the visible matter distribution @xmath69 ( and hence the potential @xmath70 ) being known from various observational data and modeling , solutions of equations ( [ eq : poisson_eqns ] ) , ( [ eq : rhodm_eqn ] ) , ( [ eq : psi_eqn ] ) with appropriate boundary conditions , which we choose as ( 0)=(0)=0 , and ( ) _ ||=0 = ( ) _ ||=0 = 0 , [ eq : boundary_cond ] give us a three - parameter family of self - consistent solutions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for chosen values of the parameters ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "for a given solution , the rotation curve of the galaxy , @xmath74 , i.e. , the circular rotation velocities in the equatorial plane of the galaxy as a function of the galactocentric distance ( @xmath75 ) on the equatorial plane , can be calculated from @xmath76 =   r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\big[\\phidm(r , z=0)+\\phivis(r , z=0)\\big]\\ , ,    \\label{eq : v_c_def}\\ ] ] @xmath77 being the distance normal to the equatorial plane .",

    "very recently , the cogent collaboration  @xcite has also reported an excess of low ( nuclear recoil ) energy events , which may also be pointing towards a low - mass wimp dm candidate .",
    "we shall discuss these issues within the context of our self - consistent model of the galaxy s dark halo in a work now in progress .",
