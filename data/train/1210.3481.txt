    "layered compounds of transition - metal elements frequently show interesting and novel electrical and magnetic properties and have been studied extensively . among them , la@xmath0cuo@xmath2 @xcite and lafeaso @xcite as the representatives are widely known because of their superconductivity with high critical temperatures after doping or under high pressures , in which the cuo@xmath0 square planar layers and the feas tetrahedral layers play a substantial role respectively .",
    "now another class of layered compounds built from alternatively stacking special octahedral layers m@xmath0q@xmath0o ( m = fe or ti ; q = as , sb , s , or se ) with otherwise layers are attracting much attention.@xcite here an m@xmath0q@xmath0o layer includes an anti - cuo@xmath0-type m@xmath0o square planar layer with two q atoms respectively located above and below the center of each m@xmath0o square unit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figa ] , the m@xmath0q@xmath0o layer is in an octahedral layer structure , bridging or a combination of the cuo@xmath0 square planar layer and the feas tetrahedral layer structures , which is thus expected to show distinct electronic and magnetic properties and possibly superconductivity by doping or under pressure .",
    "fe@xmath0q@xmath0o layer - based ( q = s or se ) oxychalcogenides were first synthesized in 1992 @xcite and recently characterized to be antiferromagnetic insulators with a magnetic moment of @xmath3 on each fe ion experimentally@xcite and with strong correlation effects suggested theoretically.@xcite to our knowledge , there has been no any structural distortion found experimentally in these compounds .",
    "ti@xmath0q@xmath0o layer - based ( q = as or sb ) oxypnictides have been also studied for a quite long time .",
    "compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0q@xmath0o were first synthesized in 1990,@xcite which subsequently have been intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite the temperature - dependent powder neutron diffraction measurement showed that there is a structural distortion in the ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o layer at a temperature of about 120k,@xcite which corresponds well to the observed anomalies in the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements.@xcite however , no neutron scattering due to magnetic spin ordering was detected .",
    "meanwhile , the measurement further found that the bond distance ratio of o - ti - o / sb - ti - sb increases below the transition temperature , but the crystal space group symmetry remains unchanged after the structural distortion.@xcite this is different from the tetragonal - orthorhombic structural distortions observed in the iron pnictides.@xcite    recently another new ti@xmath0as@xmath0o layer - based oxypnictide bati@xmath0as@xmath0o was successfully synthesized,@xcite which shows the similar characteristics as na@xmath0ti@xmath0q@xmath0o , namely there are anomalies observed as well in the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility , resistivity , and heat capacity measurements at a temperature of about 200k.@xcite considering that the similar anomalies are observed in the iron pnictides , in which the superconductivity takes place when the anomaly is suppressed , one thus speculates that the ti@xmath0q@xmath0o layer - based oxypnictides may also be another parent compounds for the high t@xmath4 superconductivity . in the iron pnictides , those anomalies are ascribed to the tetragonal - orthorhombic structural transitions accompanied by the collinear antiferromagnetic ordering.@xcite the underlying mechanism is still in debate , either the as - bridged antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions between fluctuating fe local moments @xcite or spin density wave instability induced by the fermi surface nesting.@xcite there are now more and more evidences in favor of the fluctuating fe local moment picture .",
    "especially , the neutron inelastic scattering experiments have shown that the low - energy magnetic excitations can be well described by the spin waves based on the quantum heisenberg model.@xcite    likewise , the scenario in ti@xmath0q@xmath0o layer - based oxypnictides is very confusing .",
    "the experimentally observed anomalies suggest that there is an antiferromagnetic transition , but no magnetic ordering has been detected .",
    "theoretically , no ordered magnetic state has been either found in the first - principles electronic structure calculations,@xcite which however show that there is a fermi surface nesting .",
    "it was thus suggested that the observed anomalies would be due to charge density wave or spin density wave instability induced by such a fermi surface nesting.@xcite    in order to clarify the issue , we performed the thorough first - principles electronic structure calculations upon compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0q@xmath0o ( q = as , sb ) .",
    "we find that the ground state of na@xmath0ti@xmath0as@xmath0o is a blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic semiconductor , in contrast , the ground state of na@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o is a bi - collinear antiferromagnetic semimetal . and",
    "we verify that these two antiferromagnetic states both are indeed induced by the fermi surface nesting rather than based on local magnetic moments .",

    "[ figg ] , we plot the calculated total and atomic orbital - resolved partial density of states for na@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o in the nonmagnetic state , which are overall similar to the ones of na@xmath0ti@xmath0as@xmath0o ( fig .",

    "this is easily understandable because the sb @xmath40-orbitals are more diffusive and extended than the as @xmath25-orbitals .",

[ fige ] , which clearly reflects the two dimensional character of the electronic structures by the nearly @xmath41-dispersionless fermi surface sheets , being consistent with the layered crystal structure . as we see , the fermi surfaces in these two compounds are very similar in shape to each other .",
    "there are now six fermi surface sheets for each fermi surface , among which there are the two nearly degenerate square - box - like fermi - surface sheets centered around x contributed from the hole - type bands in conjugation with another two similar fermi surface sheets centered around m but from the electron - type bands .",

    "nevertheless the neutron diffractions indeed found a commensurate structural distortion but without the space group symmetry breakdown .",
    "right now we still can not exclude any weak magnetic ordering just based on the powder neutron diffraction because of its low resolution .",
    "the issue that we meet here is still whether or not there exists a magnetic long - range order related to the structural distortion , based on either local moments formed around ti atoms or spin - density wave induced by the fermi surface nesting ; otherwise , whether or not there exists a spin - unpolarized charge - density wave related to the structural distortion , induced still by the fermi surface nesting . in order to clarify this issue ,",
    "we have carried out the systematical and extensive calculations on compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o by constructing a wide variety of unit cells and magnetic orders .",
    "we first performed the spin - unpolarized calculations with different unit cells and possible distortions , especially by elaborately constructing new unit cells in consideration of the nesting vector between x and m points in the brillouin zone .",
    "it turns out that all the distortions and structures different from the original one are unstable .",
    "we thus exclude spin - unpolarized charge - density waves in compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o .",
    "we then investigated whether or not any magnetic order exists , based on local moments around ti atoms .",
    "if there are local moments formed around ti atoms , the exchange interactions between these local moments would be either pn - bridged or o - bridged superexchange interaction with the direct exchange interaction between the nearest neighbor ti atoms .",
    "there would be a variety of stable or metastable magnetic orders resulting from the competition among these exchange interactions , such as the ferromagnetic , checkerboard antiferromagnetic , and collinear antiferromagnetic orders , all of which were found to be stable or metatable in fe - based superconducting parent compounds.@xcite our spin - polarized calculations show that none of these magnetic orders is stable or metastable in compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o , similar to the previous calculations that show no magnetic ordering found in na@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o.@xcite we thus exclude magnetic orders based on local moments .    to the end",
    ", we came to study possible magnetic orders based on spin - density waves induced by the fermi surface nesting .",
    "as presented above , there are two independent and orthogonal but equivalent nesting vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "a possible spin density wave will oscillate as @xmath46 on the ti - ti square lattice ( @xmath47 being a lattice site vector and @xmath48 magnetization vector ) , with a wave vector @xmath49 equal to a commensurate linear combination of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , namely @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 being integers ) .",
    "we elaborately constructed several kinds of magnetic orders with magnetic unit cells based on such wave vectors @xmath49 . through the calculations , we eventually find two stable peculiar magnetic orders with wave vectors @xmath55 and @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) respectively , called as blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order and bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order respectively .",

    "the large blue circles represent the projected sites of pn atom into the ti@xmath0o plane , the dark olive circles represent the o atoms , the small black circles with arrows represent ti atoms and the green and red arrows indicate the two opposite directions of ti moments .",
    "the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order ( a ) and the bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order ( b ) are shown . here a small blue dashed square represents an @xmath56 unit in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the large blue dashed square @xmath57 unit in ( a ) , and the blue dashed rectangle @xmath58 unit in ( b ) correspond to a magnetic unit cell in the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order and bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order respectively . for the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order ,",
    "the ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o layer is divided into square blocks denoted by gray dash - dotted lines .",
    "the four ti moments in a block are in the same direction and those between two nearest neighbor blocks have opposite directions.,width=283 ]    figure [ fig8-two - order](a ) schematically shows the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order , in which the ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o ( pn = as , sb ) layer is divided into @xmath59-squares represented by the dash - dotted thin lines .",
    "each square is a magnetic block with the moments of four ti atoms being parallel . between the nearest neighbor blocks , the block moments are in anti - parallel .",
    "but the magnetic unit cell is a @xmath60 square .",
    "it should be emphasized that in each magnetic block the four ti moments are centered around a pn atom rather than o atom . for the latter case ,",
    "the calculations show that it is unstable or energetically unfavorable .",
    "thus in the blocked checkerboard anitferromagnetic order any pair of the next nearest neighbor ti moments bridged by an o atom is always in anti - parallel .",
    "this is also consistent with the o - bridged superexchange effect being more stronger than the pn - bridged superexchange effect , even though this magnetic order is induced by the fermi surface nesting .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8-two - order](b ) , we schematically show the bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order , in which the ti moments align in parallel along a diagonal direction and in anti - parallel along the other diagonal direction on the ti - ti square lattice .",
    "in other words , if the ti - ti square lattice is divided into two square sublattices @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the ti moments on each sublattice take their own collinear antiferromagnetic order . here",
    "the magnetic unit cell is a @xmath63 rectangle . unlike in the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order , here half of pairs of the next nearest neighbor ti moments bridged by o atoms are in parallel while the other half are in anti - parallel , likewise with pn atoms .    for compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o the moment around each ti atom",
    "is found to be about @xmath64 in both blocked checkerboard and bi - collinear antiferromagnetic orders .",
    "this is consistent with the spin density wave mechanism , in which the moment should be small since its formation is only attributed to those states nearby the fermi energy .",
    "considering there is a large amount of antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuation in low dimensional systems , the effective ordering moment around each ti atom will be further much reduced .",
    "this is likely the reason why no magnetic ordering in compounds na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o has so far been detected by the powder neutron diffraction.@xcite    a bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order was first introduced in the study of fe - based superconductors to describe the ground state of @xmath65-fete,@xcite very interestingly as a strong evidence to against the view of spin density waves in the fe - based superconducting parent compounds , since there is no any fermi surface nesting vector to correspond to such a magnetic order , moreover there is a large magnetic moment of about 2.5@xmath1 formed on each fe atom .",
    "the substantial difference between the two cases lies in the fact that there is only one electron in 3@xmath66-orbital for a ti@xmath67 ion , in contrast there are five electrons in 3@xmath66-orbital for an fe@xmath68 ion .",
    "accordingly it is not expected that there is strong electronic correlation effect in na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o .",

    "<S> from the first - principles calculations , we have studied the electronic and magnetic structures of compound na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o ( pn = as or sb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the ground state na@xmath0ti@xmath0as@xmath0o is a blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic semiconductor with a small band gap of about 0.15 ev , in contrast , na@xmath0ti@xmath0sb@xmath0o is a bi - collinear antiferromagnetic semimetal , both with a small moment of about 0.5@xmath1 around each ti atom . we show that there is a strong fermi surface nesting in na@xmath0ti@xmath0pn@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> and we verify that the blocked checkerboard and bi - collinear antiferromagnetic states both are the spin density waves induced by the fermi surface nesting . </S>",
    "<S> a tetramer structural distortion is found in company with the formation of a blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order , in good agreement with the experimentally observed commensurate structural distortion but with space group symmetry retained after the anomaly happening . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis and discussion in connection with experimental observations are given as well . </S>"
