    "one of the major goals in hypernuclear physics is to obtain information on baryon - baryon interactions in a unified way .",
    "however , due to the limitation of hyperon ( @xmath11 ) nucleon ( @xmath12 ) scattering data , the @xmath13 potential models proposed so far , such as the nijmegen models , have a large degree of ambiguity .",
    "therefore , quantitative analyses of light @xmath2 hypernuclei , where the features of @xmath8 interactions appear rather clearly in observed level structures are indispensable . for this purpose ,",
    "accurate measurements of @xmath14-ray spectra @xcite and high resolution @xmath15 reaction experiment @xcite have been performed systematically .",
    "these experiments are source of invaluable information about spin - dependent components of @xmath8 interaction .",
    "useful constraints on the @xmath13 interaction components have been provided by shell model @xcite and few - body cluster @xcite calculations . among the @xmath13 spin - dependent components , spin - orbit terms are important , since they are intimately related to modeling the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "for example , it is well known that the antisymmetric spin - orbit ( als ) forces come out qualitatively different in one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models @xcite and in quark models @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the als force based on quark model @xcite is as strong as to cancel the symmetric spin - orbit ( sls ) force , while the als force of nijmegen potentials @xcite is of a smaller strength . to extract information on these spin - orbit forces ,",
    "specific @xmath14-ray experiments @xcite and @xmath16 reaction experiments @xcite have been performed . in the @xmath14-ray experiments ,",
    "spin - orbit dominated energy splittings of @xmath17 kev for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 doublet of levels in @xmath20be @xcite and @xmath21 kev for the @xmath22 doublet in @xmath3c @xcite were measured .",
    "considerably larger energy splittings of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 mev were reported from the analysis of the @xmath0-orbit , @xmath26-orbit and @xmath27-orbit peaks , respectively , observed in the @xmath28y spectrum of the @xmath16 reaction @xcite .",
    "however , these splittings are most likely caused by core - excited configurations and have little to do with the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit forces was studied within few - body @xcite and shell model calculations @xcite of @xmath20be and @xmath3c .",
    "reasonable strengths were introduced to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that small energy splittings for @xmath20be and @xmath3c were predicted by hiyama et al .",
    "@xcite using als forces based on a quark model .",
    "on the other hand , it was pointed out in the shell - model calculation by millener @xcite that a @xmath8 tensor contribution was as important as spin - orbit for these energy splittings .",
    "more information about spin - orbit interaction in other @xmath2 hypernuclei is certainly needed . for this purpose ,",
    "it is planned to explore the level structure of some medium heavy @xmath2 hypernuclei at jlab .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to study the spin - orbit doublet states @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath2 hypernuclei built on @xmath31 nuclear cores .",
    "it is expected that the spin - spin and tensor terms of the @xmath8 interaction are not effective as a consequence of the @xmath32-cluster dominating structure , and we can thus safely assess @xmath13 spin - orbit forces .",
    "however , if @xmath32 clusters in these hypernuclei are broken , the spin - spin and the tensor interactions might contribute to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 energy splitting as well . in this paper",
    ", we investigate spin - spin and spin - orbit contributions to this energy splitting and give qualitative predictions of the splittings in @xmath3c , @xmath4o , @xmath5ne , @xmath6si and @xmath7ca . for this aim",
    "we apply the esc08c potential , which has been recently proposed by nijmegen group , using a mean field approach based on realistic baryon interactions @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe our method .",
    "selected results are presented and discussed in the third section , and a summary is given in the final section .",
    "we calculate spectra of single @xmath2 hypernuclei using a hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the kinetic term , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denotes interaction among nucleons ( @xmath2 and nucleons ) and @xmath37 is a center of mass term . in our calculations",
    "we use a realistic @xmath8 interaction and a realistic @xmath38 interaction corrected by the density dependent term which simulates @xmath39 force .",
    "if we introduce the creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) for nucleons and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for @xmath2 , we can express the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) in the formalism of second quantization @xmath44 with the kinetic matrix elements @xmath45 antisymmetrized @xmath38 interaction matrix elements @xmath46 and @xmath8 interaction matrix elements @xmath47 all expressed in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the harmonic oscillator basis depends on one parameter @xmath48 which defines the oscillator lengths @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the wave functions of nucleons and @xmath2 , respectively , due to the relations @xmath51 in basis which is large enough the physical results do not depend on @xmath48 . in our calculations we use @xmath52 and @xmath53 mev .",
    "the mean field is constructed in our model as follows .",
    "first we solve the nuclear part of hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) @xmath54 within the hartree - fock approximation . as a result",
    "we obtain the wave function @xmath55 as well as the nuclear density @xmath56 of the nuclear core of a hypernucleus .",
    "then we calculate the single - particle energies @xmath57 by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath58 where @xmath59 assuming that the @xmath2 hyperon interacts with the mean field of the core nucleus .",
    "the hypernuclear wave function at the level of mean - field approximation is defined as latexmath:[$|i\\rangle = c^{\\dagger}_i      in our model , we used the realistic @xmath38 interaction nnlo@xmath61  @xcite .",
    "it is a chiral next - to - next - to leading order potential with parameters optimized to minimize the effect of three - body interactions ( their effect , however , still remains relatively important ) , which makes this force useful for many - body calculations ( for more details about the optimization procedure see @xcite ) .",
    "matrix elements of this interaction were generated by the cens code @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of three - body forces is still not negligible . if we perform the calculations purely with the two - body @xmath38 interactions we do not obtain correct distribution of the nuclear density .",
    "the nuclear density distribution is more compressed which leads to much smaller nuclear rms radii than are the experimental values . in general , this has influence on the single particle energies of @xmath2 , particularly on the splitting between the @xmath62 and @xmath63 states as can be deduced from the bertlmann - martin inequalities @xcite .",
    "for this reason we add a corrective density dependent ( dd ) term of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the coupling constant and @xmath66 is the spin exchange operator .",
    "this density dependent interaction term was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that it gives the same contribution to the hartree - fock energy as the contact three - body interaction @xmath67 the term ( [ ddterm ] ) is necessary for reasonable description of correct nuclear single particle spectra within the mean field calculations with realistic @xmath38 interactions @xcite and improves significantly the description of the nuclear density distributions and radii @xcite . in this paper",
    "we fix the values of @xmath65 for each hypernucleus independently to get the realistic values of nuclear radii as well as nuclear densities with respect to the available experimental data @xcite and the calculations within the rmf model @xcite .",
    "our future goal is to implement directly the chiral @xmath68 interaction instead of the density dependent term ( [ ddterm ] ) . in this case",
    "we would not need to fit any independent parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath8 interaction implemented in our model is the yng force derived from the nijmegen model esc08 @xcite , namely its version esc08c @xcite .",
    "it is represented in a three - range gaussian form : @xmath69 for more details including the values of the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath70 , @xmath43 , @xmath71 see  @xcite .",
    "we represent the @xmath8 interaction ( [ gaussian ] ) in the form of the interaction elements of eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that there are no tensor terms in the esc08c version @xcite used in this work .",
    "the @xmath8 interaction depends explicitly on the fermi momentum @xmath72 .",
    "we can either consider @xmath72 as a free parameter of our model and fit its value to the observed hypernuclear spectra or we can fix the value of @xmath72 within the thomas - fermi approximation through the relation @xmath73 the average density @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ thomasfermi ] ) can be expressed within the average density approximation ( ada ) by the following prescription @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the density of the nuclear core and @xmath77 is the density of @xmath2 in the hypernucleus . note that we have to perform the hypernuclear calculation to obtain @xmath77 and determine the value of fermi momentum @xmath72 . in other words",
    "the value of @xmath72 has to be evaluated self - consistently because the equation ( [ avrho ] ) depends on the result of a calculation which itself depends on @xmath72 .",
    "the symmetric ( sls ) and antisymmetric ( als ) spin - orbit terms in the @xmath8 potential are included within the scheerbaum approximation @xcite . due to this approximation",
    "we include the effect of the sls and als terms directly at the mean field level .",
    "we add the following contribution into the matrix ( [ u_field ] ) : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 the value of @xmath81 in ( [ sls ] ) is set to 0.7 @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the form of the function @xmath83 in ( [ sls ] ) is identical for the sls and als terms , they only differ by the values of the input parameters . it should be noted that the @xmath8-@xmath84 coupling term in esc08c is renormalized into the @xmath8-@xmath8 part of g - matrix interaction , giving rise to an important part of the density dependence @xcite .    in the rmf approach ,",
    "the strong interactions among point - like hadrons are mediated by _ effective _ mesonic degrees of freedom .",

    "in this section , we present selected results of our calculations of the hypernuclei @xmath3c , @xmath4o , @xmath5ne , @xmath6si and @xmath7ca . in the hypernuclei with the doubly magic nuclear core - @xmath4o and @xmath7ca -",
    "the calculations within hartree - fock method are straightforward .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath3c , @xmath5ne and @xmath6si , the ground states of the corresponding core nuclei have more complex structure  @xcite and it is necessary to take into account configuration mixing and perform calculations within a deformed basis in order to describe their structure properly .",
    "nevertheless , even calculations within the spherical ho basis could provide interesting information about these hypernuclei if we consider various configurations of the corresponding nuclear cores . in this work , we performed calculations for the following configurations : @xmath95 and @xmath96 in @xmath97c ; @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 in @xmath101ne ; @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in @xmath105si .",

    "it is also to be pointed out that in the cases when the states @xmath30 and @xmath29 are close to be degenerate in the column a , the energy splitting @xmath130 comes almost entirely from the sls and als spin - orbit interaction terms .     the functions @xmath157 ( sls , solid line ) and @xmath158 ( -als , dashed line ) defined by eq .",

    "this appeared important also in the calculations of hypernuclear spectra since the esc08c @xmath8 interaction depends explicitly on the fermi momentum @xmath72 which was determined using the averaged density approximation .",
    "reasonable description of the density distributions in the studied ( hyper)nuclear systems is thus crucial .",
    "the main objective of the present calculations is to study the influence of sls and als spin orbit terms on the energy splitting @xmath130 of the @xmath2 levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath130 splittings in @xmath4o and @xmath7ca , calculated within the mean field model based on realistic baryon interactions and the rmf model nl - sh are very close to each other . in the case of @xmath3c , @xmath5ne and @xmath6si",
    "it is desirable to perform calculations within deformed basis and take into account configuration mixing of the nuclear core wave function .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations in the spherical ho basis , which considered several configurations of the nuclear core of these hypernuclei yielded valuable insight into the issue of the spin dependence of the @xmath169 interaction and the @xmath2 spin - orbit splitting in these open - shell hypernuclei .",
    "we found that the energy splittings of the @xmath2 levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 calculated using realistic @xmath38 and @xmath8 interactions depend strongly on the chosen configuration of the nuclear core , unlike the rmf approach .",
    "for the configurations which give the energy splitting close to zero when the @xmath8 spin - orbit interaction is switched off , the @xmath130 splitting is almost entirely due to the als and sls terms and is in rough agreement with the rmf values . by comparing the results for the esc08c model shown in columns b and c in table 2",
    "we conclude that the magnitude of the als term which acts in an opposite way to the sls term is about 2/3 of the sls magnitude .",
    "our results demonstrate that it is highly desirable to explore further the energy splitting of the @xmath2 @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels in @xmath0- and @xmath1-shell hypernuclei , both experimentally and theoretically , in order to extract important information about the spin - dependence of the @xmath8 interaction , as well as the inner structure of the hypernuclei under study .",
    "there are several issues left for further improvements of the present calculations .",
    "first , we intend to develop the code which will allow to perform calculations within an axially symmetric single particle basis and allow for configuration mixing in the nuclear core wave function . in this case",
    "we would be able to calculate open - shell hypernuclei ( such as @xmath5ne or @xmath6si ) more precisely .",
    "second , we intend to implement directly the 3-body @xmath68 forces instead of the 2-body density dependent term in our hamiltonian .",
    "third , it is desirable to incorporate the @xmath8 tensor terms and explore their contribution to the energy splitting .",
    "another extension is to include the core polarization effects .",
    "we intend to develop a scheme which couples @xmath2 single - particle states with one - phonon or possibly multi - phonon excitations of the core nucleus within an equation of motion phonon model ( empm ) @xcite treating nuclear excitations in multiphonon basis . in this method the tamm - dancoff phonon operators @xmath170",
    "are used to build hilbert space spanned by one- , two- and three - phonon configurations . in this way",
    "we will get rather complex description of hypernuclei which includes not only core polarization effects but also beyond mean field correlations .",
    "this work was partly supported by the gacr grant p203/15/04301s .",
    "highly appreciated was the access to computing and storage facilities provided by the metacentrum under the program lm2010005 and the cerit - sc under the program center cerit scientific cloud , part of the operational program research and development for innovations , reg .",
