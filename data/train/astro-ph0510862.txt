    "information is just noise if we do not know it exists , or how to use it .",
    "the smithsonian / nasa astrophysics data system , in collaboration with astronomy s data centers and publishers , has been working for somewhat more than a decade towards making the information of astronomy increasingly discoverable , available , and useful .",
    "the test of an organization which provides its users with information is whether it has provided the information which the users need , and at what cost .",
    "a cost benefit analysis of the information system in astronomy , consisting of the ads , the cds , and the journals ( the data archives were not included in the analysis ) shows a benefit of about 7%  of the total cost of the entire discipline can be ascribed to the joint effors of these organizations in creating the current on - line system , compared with the paper system of a decade ago ( kurtz , et al , 2005 ) .",
    "this ten times the total cost of running these organizations , and about a factor of 100 times the differential cost of making the services on - line .",
    "astronomy is currently creating another layer of on - line information services , beginning with the archives , as opposed to the journals .",
    "this effort , known as the  virtual observatory ,  has likely much in common with the efforts which preceeded it , and which now collaborate with it .",
    "the greatest lesson to be learned from the recent past is that massive success is possible ; however it is not inevitable .",
    "concentrated , complex organized information is the basis of intellegence .",
    "before an information system can provide sophisticated tools to facilitate the search and retrieval of complex information , it must actually have sufficient information about the information ( meta - data ) to allow the information to be organized with a degree of sophistication equal to the capabilities of the search",
    ".    from its inception the ads has put a substantial fraction of its total resources toward the task of collecting , creating , and organizing meta - data .",
    "grant , et al ( 2000 ) list hundreds of sources of these data ; this is but a partial list . very often a single source can require several years of patient negotiation with different entities ( e.g. the copyright holder and the publisher ) .",
    "collecting data from existing data providers consumes substantial effort .",
    "there is no widely used standard for meta - data transmission ; the oai - pmh system ( www.openarchives.org ) , while promising in concept , actually is only used by a fraction ( @xmath0 ) of our sources , and even with these each individual provider has unique extensions .",
    "this means that the responsibility for parsing the meta - data and putting it into a standard format rests with the ads staff .",
    "this is different than for some other information services , where the data sources are required to adhere to a standard format .",
    "examples are citeseer ( citeseer.ist.psu.edu ) and citebase ( www.citebase.org ) .",
    "the difference resulting from the two approches is large .",
    "ads has been a mature research tool since its inception ; researchers have been able to count on it to be up to date and complete for the past decade .",
    "the services which require provider compliance are still quite incomplete ; they function primarily as research tools for computer scientists interested in text retrieval.a754-1.ps    this is also different than for google scholar ( scholar.google.com ) which , like ads , negotiates access to meta - data from providers , but unlike ads is not able to devote the resources to understanding , and individually parsing , the peculiarities of each individual source . for the areas ads covers its abilities far exceed those of google scholar .",
    "there is a lesson here for other information services : just do it ! waiting for all the information to be included in the service to be available in just the right form delays the full implementation of the service by a substantial factor .",
    "if a service is valuable enough to offer , it is valuable enough for the service provider to make work .",
    "this is not a totally overwhelming task ; the three major data services in astronomy today , ads , cds , and ned all function with relativly small staffs ( the ads staff size is six ) , and all are able to put substantial effort into data ingest .",
    "information retrieval is successful if you find the information you need , not , as mick jagger might say , the information you want .",
    "it is also important that this be able to be done quickly , as the most valuable commodity in any research endevour is the time of the best researchers .",
    "there are many different techniques for achieving this , some as simple as making the send button on the web site a bright color .    the ads has been developing and implementing these techniques , often in advance of any other group , throughout its entire history , begining with our use of combination of evidence ( belkin , et al 1995 ) ; partial match , natural language techniques , astronomy specific ontologies , and hyperlinks from the outset ( kurtz , et al 1993 ) . the connection with cds / simbad ( grant , et al 1993 , wenger , et al 2000 ) was another early achievement .    linking directly to data",
    "has been a feature of the ads since its inception , with links to the _ a&a _ data tables ( ochsenbein & lequeux 1995 ) and to the archival data - sets in the adil ( plante , et al 1996 ) being early examples .",
    "much of the talk at the conference described the ir advances made by ads , the interested reader is referred to kurtz , et al ( 2000 ) and kurtz , et al ( 2005 ) for historical summaries .",
    "second order database operators ( kurtz , 1992 ) are database functions which , instead of returning the data corresponding to a query , performs some function on data associated with those data .",
    "for example a query might return a list of papers concerning redshift surveys ; these papers have lists of papers they reference .",
    "a @xmath1 order operator could take these lists , collate and sort them , then return a list of those papers which are most cited by papers concerning redshift suveys .",
    "kurtz , et al ( 2002 , 2005 ) discuss how using these operators within ads one can obtain the most recent , most popular , most useful , and most educational papers on a complex topic of interest .    here",
    "we demonstrate how to use ads , and @xmath1 order queries , to discovery the most useful on - line data sets for a particular topic .",
    "we begin , in figure 1 , by asking for all articles with linked data - sets ( this requirement is not shown , it is futher down the form ) on the x - ray properties of the nearby cluster of galaxies abell 754 .",
    "the result of this simple ads / simbad query is shown in figure 2 , there are 79 articles which meet this description .    b    now we are ready to use a @xmath1a754 - 1.ps order operator .",
    "we assert that , on average , people who have read the articles in the list in figure 2 are people interested in data about the x - ray properties of abell 754 .",
    "the articles these people read the most , will , on average , be important to us , as we are interested in data concerning the x - ray properties of abell 754 .",
    "next we go to the bottom of that list , shown in figure 3 , we select all 79 articles from the list , and request the also - read articles for that group .    the result of that query is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the top five articles are compendium articles on the x - ray properties of nearby clusters from the chandra , rosat , xmm , asca , and einstein satellites , including abell 754 .",
    "this confirms our assertion above .",
    "if we follow the  d ",
    "link for the top article , we go to the associated page in the chandra archive , shown in figure 5 . from here one can download a substantial fraction of the chandra data on nearby x - ray clusters , and one can also access the software tools necessary to reduce and analyze it .",
    "the basic data used by this service is currently being created by the archives , establishing links between data in the archives and published papers .",
    "recently the astrophysical journal has established a method of doing this directly by authors .",
    "since late 2003 ( kurtz , et al 2003 ) the ads has provided a notification service , myads , which uses the @xmath1 order operators to give our users a sophisticated and powerful means of keeping abreast of the current literature in their sub fields of astronomy and physics .",
    "beginning in the spring of 2005 we have extended this service with the collaboration of the arxiv ( www.arxiv.org ) to include the arxiv e - print service .",
    "we now have three different , complimentary services : myads - astronomy , myads - physics , and myads - arxiv .",
    "myads - arxiv is facilitated by a tight collaboration between ads and arxiv , this includes sharing of readership information , parsing the reference lists , and merging the preprints with the journal articles for the same article .",
    "once an article appears in the final published source ads adopts that version as definitive .",
    "myads - arxiv is a fully customized ( to each individual user ) , open access virtual journal covering the most important papers of the past week in physics and astronomy . between a fifth and a quarter of",
    "all working astronomers already subscribe to myads .",
    "figure 6 shows the custom version belonging to the first author , for the week preceeding the conference .",
    "it is also possible to make a myads page which is not associated with an individual ; for example the link http://adsabs.harvard.edu/myads/cache/278851069@xmath2pre.html points to a myads - arxiv page covering virtual observatory matters .",
    "this can be viewed as an automatically generated newsletter .    )",
    "szalay ( 2005 ) has presented the challenges and goals of a mode of astronomy based on very large , homogeneous data - sets , such as the sdss , or in the future the lsst .",
    "the scientific case for these developments is exciting and compelling .",
    "it seems likely , however , that for at least the next twenty years most of the money and effort of astronomy will be devoted to pointed observations with very large and expensive instruments .",
    "currently hst , xmm , keck , vlt , vla and many other large pointeed instruments dominate top level astronomy . in the future ,",
    "in addition to the mega survey instruments , owl , gmt , celt , con - x , jwst , alma and other very costly pointed instruments will play a major role .    with the cost of dark time on a $ 1,000,000,000 telescope running around $ 50,000 per hour the re - use of data in the telescope archives would seem a highly cost effective means of doing research , as is now the case with many current archives .    in order for astronomers to be able to find relevant data - sets from pointed observations the ads will index the abstracts of observing proposals , and will point to the page in the archive devoted to that project .",
    "we have begun by indexing the proposals from several leading archives ."
