    "many cosmological models driven by dark energy have been proposed in the literature for explaining the discovered cosmic acceleration of the universe @xcite . at present , the preferred scenario is provided by the so - called @xmath4cdm model @xcite . however",
    ", this model is plagued with the cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) @xcite .",
    "such a problem occurs because the value of the cosmological constant ( cc ) suggested by the recent observations is incredibly small as compared to simple estimates from quantum theory of fields ( about 120 orders of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "decaying vacuum cosmologies or @xmath4(t)-cosmologies @xcite is a possibility to alleviate this problem .",
    "this kind of models try to explain the ccp through the hypothesis that @xmath4 couples with matter in such a way that it decays with time .",
    "qualitatively , this means that the value of @xmath4 is very small today because the universe is too old .",
    "@xmath4(t)-cosmologies are defined by some direct ( or indirect ) phenomenological time dependence of @xmath4 whose free parameters must be constrained by the cosmological tests .",
    "one of these tests is the age of the universe at high redshifts @xcite . since the universe must be older than any object contained in it , the basic idea of this test is to compare the age of the universe at a given redshift with the estimated age of the oldest objects at the same redshift .    in this paper ,",
    "the age test is applied for two classes of @xmath4(t)-cosmologies .",
    "the first one generalizes the chen and wu model @xcite by considering a cosmological term scaling as @xmath13 .",
    "the second class is the one recently proposed by wang and meng @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the energy density of the cdm component scales as @xmath14 .",
    "the prediction of both models are confronted to the old quasar apm 08279 + 5255 at redshift z = 3.91 , whose age was recently estimated trough its iron abundance @xcite .",
    "in 1990 , by using dimensional arguments , chen and wu @xcite proposed the following functional form for the cosmological term :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath17 is the scale factor of the frw type geometries .",
    "the power @xmath5 was fixed by considering that gravity is described by a classical field after the planck age . in what follows , by assuming that the vacuum energy density , and the cosmic acceleration at the present stage may have a quantum origin , we discuss the general @xmath0 dependence @xcite    @xmath18    an advantage of this functional form is that the chen and wu model is recovered for @xmath19 whereas , for @xmath3 , it reduces to the cosmic concordance ( @xmath4cdm ) model .",
    "now , by assuming spatial flatness as predicted by inflation and observationally suggested by the wmap experiments @xcite , the frw equation plus the energy conservation law can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the energy density for the pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) fluid , and @xmath22 is the hubble parameter .    now , let us determine the expression for @xmath23 , the age of the universe at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "first , one must integrate the energy conservation law for obtaining the @xmath21 , and inserting the result into the frw equation , it thus follow that    @xmath25.\\ ] ]    note that for @xmath3 this expression for the hubble parameter reduces to the one of the flat @xmath4cdm model , as should be expected .",
    "finally , by integrating again , we have for @xmath23 :    @xmath26^{-\\frac{1}{2}}dx,\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is a convenient integration variable .",
    "it is straightforward to find similar expressions for the logarithm solution ( @xmath28 ) , but this case will not be considered here .",
    "it can also be shown that @xmath8 can not be so large as one wishes .",
    "actually , the weak energy condition for the matter density implies an upper bound @xmath29 ( see appendix ) .",
    "more recently , a new decaying vacuum cosmology was proposed by wang and meng @xcite . unlike the common approach in the literature",
    ", they did not assume a functional form for @xmath4(t ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the decay law is deduced from its effect on the cdm evolution .",
    "qualitatively , since the vacuum is decaying into cdm particles , the created matter must dilute more slowly in comparison with the standard evolution ( @xmath30 ) . thus , assuming that the deviation from the conservation law is characterized by a positive constant @xmath10 , one may write @xmath31 where @xmath10 is a small positive constant and @xmath32 is the present value of @xmath33 . inserting the above expression in the energy conservation law , one finds @xmath34 hence , by integrating the above expression , it thus follows that    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is an integration constant which can be associated to  the ground state of vacuum \" ( note that the present vacuum energy density is @xmath37 ) .    under such conditions ,",
    "the frw equation for the wm model reads :    @xmath38,\\ ] ]    with an age - redshift relation given by    @xmath39    as should be expected , by taking @xmath40 in the above expression ( no cdm creation ) , the age - redshift relation for the @xmath4cdm model is recovered .",
    "let us now discuss some constraints by considering the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 , as a cosmic clock .",
    "such a quasar , located at @xmath41 , has an estimated age from 2 to 3 gyr , with a best fit age of 2.1 gyr @xcite .",
    "as first discussed by alcaniz and lima @xcite , the age test here is defined by the condition    @xmath42    where @xmath23 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath24 and @xmath43 is the age of the quasar at the same redshift .",
    "it just says that the universe is older than any structure that it contains .    for test both models",
    "we have used the optimal value of the matter density parameter as given by the wmap team @xcite , @xmath44 , whereas the hubble parameter is the one provided by the hst team @xcite , @xmath45 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless age parameter , @xmath46 , in such a way that for the 2.0 gyr old quasar , this value of the hubble parameter constrains it to the range @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , for a given value of @xmath49 , only models with an expanding age bigger than this value at @xmath1 will be compatible with the existence of this object . in order to assure the robustness of our analysis ,",
    "it is also necessary to adopt the lower bound for the value of the hubble parameter , @xmath50 .",
    "the results for the chen and wu model can be seen on table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the constraints on the power @xmath8 are heavily dependent on the estimated age of the quasar . by considering that the correct age is 2 gyr , the power @xmath8 has a lower limit given by @xmath51 .",
    "this minimal value increases for @xmath52 when we consider the optimal estimated age of 2.1 gyr and it is @xmath53 if the age is @xmath54 gyr . in particular , these results imply that the @xmath4cdm ( @xmath55 ) is ruled out by this analysis , if we have @xmath56 .",
    "this result agrees with the ones recently determined by some authors for the standard @xmath4cdm model using the same quasar .",
    "they found that @xmath57 in order to be compatible with the existence of this quasar @xcite .",
    "cc +   + @xmath43 & @xmath58 + ( gyr ) + 2 & 0.21 + 2.1 & 0.28 + 3 & 0.60 +    [ tab1 ]      as in the previous model , we have made use of a routine in c to perform the age test for the wm model .",
    "the main results of our analysis are displayed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "as can be seen there , the minimal value of the free parameter @xmath10 is modified when the baryonic component is included .",
    "this kind of model was recently considered by alcaniz and lima @xcite .",
    "note that the minimum value of @xmath10 varies in the range @xmath59 .",
    "ccc +   + @xmath43 & @xmath60 & @xmath60 + ( gyr ) & ( no baryons ) & ( with baryons ) + 2 & 0.115 & 0.231 + 2.1 & 0.163 & 0.296 + 3 & 0.527 & 0.910 +    [ tab2 ]    it is also interesting to know how the minimal value of @xmath10 depends on matter density parameter . in figure 2 ,",
    "the values of @xmath60 are plotted as a function of @xmath61 for the wm model with no baryons .",
    "we see that @xmath60 is heavily dependent on the values of @xmath61 .",
    "it becomes negative for @xmath62 whether the age of the quasar is 2 gyr .",
    "the lower limit is nearly @xmath63 for 3 gyr .",
    "it is worth notice that negative values of @xmath10 are thermodynamically forbidden @xcite .",
    "alcaniz and lima @xcite also analyzed the wm model using sne ia , x - ray luminosity from galaxy clusters and cmb data .",
    "a best fit of @xmath64 at 95% c.l . was established in their joint analysis .",
    "concerning the present age test , this result is not compatible with the existence of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "actually , even for an estimated age of 2.1 gyr , the best fit found on ref .",
    "@xcite , the above value disagrees from our minimal value by 3 standard deviations .",
    "naturally , if the real age is 3 gyr the situation becomes worst .",
    "although improving the determination of the critical redshift , the presence of a baryonic component worsens the scenario for the age test because it decelerates the universe thereby decreasing the age at a given redshift .",
    "the age test has been applied for two different @xmath0 cosmologies by using the old quasar apm 08279 + 5255 . for @xmath65 ( extended chen and wu model ) we found @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the cosmic concordance @xmath4cdm model ( @xmath3 ) is incompatible with the existence of this object .",
    "this result is in line with the previous analysis by alcaniz et al .",
    "however , there is an upper limit on @xmath8 from physical and observational considerations . in particular , the original cw model ( @xmath5 )",
    "is not compatible with the wmap data because it requires @xmath66 ( see also appendix ) .",
    "finally , we have established new limits to the @xmath10 parameter of the wang and meng model ( with and with no baryons ) which are more stringent than the ones recently determined by alcaniz and lima @xcite . until the present",
    ", the existence of the old quasar constrains severely all the models present in the literature .",
    "this work was supported by cnpq ( brazilian research agency ) .",
    "i would like to thank prof .",
    "j. ademir s. lima for suggesting the problem .",
    "i am also grateful to rodrigo holanda and rose santos for the encouragement and helpful discussions .",
    "in the extended cw model , the matter density reads ( see eqs .",
    "( 3)-(5 ) ) :      now , supposing @xmath68 , it is easy to see that the matter density is always positive only if @xmath69 . thus , @xmath8 should be less than @xmath9 for @xmath70 as suggested from cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "actually , at @xmath71 , the maximum value allowed for @xmath8 is @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the original cw model ( @xmath74 ) is ruled out by the wmap data .",
