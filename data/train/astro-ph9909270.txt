    "in this talk we suggest that high - mass black holes ; i.e. , black holes of several solar masses , can be formed in binaries with low - mass main - sequence companions , provided that the hydrogen envelope of the massive star is removed in common envelope evolution which begins only after the massive star has finished he core burning ( brown , lee , & bethe 1999 ) .",
    "that is , the massive star is in the supergiant stage , which lasts only @xmath0 years , so effects of mass loss by he winds are small . since the removal of the hydrogen envelope of the massive star occurs so late , it evolves essentially as a single star , rather than one in a binary .",
    "thus , we can use evolutionary calculations of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) of single stars .",
    "we find that high - mass black holes can be formed in the collapse of stars with zams mass @xmath1 .",
    "mass loss by winds in stars sufficiently massive to undergo the lbv ( luminous blue variable ) stage may seriously affect the evolution of stars of zams @xmath2 , we take the upper limit for the evolution of the so - called transient sources to be @xmath3 zams mass . both portegies zwart , verbunt & ergma ( 1997 ) and ergma & van den heuvel ( 1998 ) have suggested that roughly our chosen range of zams masses must be responsible for the transient sources .",
    "we believe that the high - mass black hole limit of zams mass @xmath4 suggested by van den heuvel & habets ( 1984 ) and later revised to @xmath5 ( kaper et al .",
    "1995 ) applies to massive stars in binaries , which undergo rlof ( roche lobe overflow ) early in their evolution .",

    "numbers in parenthesis indicate errors in the last digits . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the most copious high - mass black holes of masses",
    "@xmath6 have been found in the transient sources such as a0620 .",
    "these have low - mass companions , predominantly of @xmath7 , such as k or m  stars . in the progenitor",
    "binaries the mass ratios must have been tiny , say @xmath8 . following the evolutionary scenario for the black hole binary of de kool et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we show that the reason for this small @xmath9-value lies in the common envelope evolution of the binary .",
    "the smaller the companion mass , the greater the radius @xmath10 the giant must reach before its envelope meets the companion .",
    "this results because the orbit of a low - mass companion must shrink by a large factor in order to expel the envelope of the giant , hence the orbit must initially have a large radius .",
    "( its final radius must be just inside its roche lobe , which sets a limit to the gravitational energy it can furnish . )",
    "a large radius @xmath10 in turn means that the primary star must be in the supergiant stage .",
    "thus it will have completed its he core burning while it is still  clothed \" with hydrogen .",
    "this prevents excessive mass loss so that the primary retains essentially the full mass of its he core when it goes supernova .",
    "we believe this is why k and m  star companions of high - mass black holes are favored .",
    "we find that the black holes in transient sources can be formed from stars with zams masses in the interval @xmath11 ( brown , lee , & bethe 1999 ) .",
    "the black hole mass is only slightly smaller than the he core mass , typically @xmath12 ( bethe , brown , & lee 1999 ) .",
    "crucial to our discussion here is the fact that single stars evolve very differently from stars in binaries that lose their h - envelope either on the main sequence ( case a ) or in the giant phase ( case b ) .",
    "however , stars that transfer mass or lose mass after core he burning ( case c ) evolve , for our purposes , as single stars , because the he core is then exposed too close to its death for wind mass loss to significantly alter its fate .",
    "the core masses of single stars and binary stars are summarized in fig .",
    "single stars above a zams mass of about @xmath13 skip convective carbon burning following core he burning , with the result , as we shall explain , that their fe cores are substantially more massive than stars in binaries , in which h - envelope has been transferred or lifted off before he core burning .",
    "these latter  naked \" he stars burn @xmath14 convectively , and end up with relatively small fe cores .",
    "the reason that they do this has to do chiefly with the large mass loss rates of the  naked \" he cores , which behave like w .- r . s . in the zams mass range @xmath15 , it is clear that many , if not most , of the single stars go into high - mass black holes , whereas stars in binaries which burn  naked \" he cores go into low - mass compact objects . in this region of zams masses the use of high he - star mass loss rates does not cause large effects ( wellstein & langer 1999 ) .    the convective carbon burning phase ( when it occurs ) is extremely important in pre - supernova evolution , because this is the first phase in which a large amount of entropy can be carried off in @xmath16-pair emission , especially if this phase is of long duration .",
    "the reaction in which carbon burns is @xmath17 ( other reactions like @xmath18 would require excessive temperatures ) .",
    "the cross section of @xmath17 is still not accurately determined ; the lower this cross section the higher the temperature of the @xmath14 burning , and therefore the more intense the @xmath16 emission . with the relatively low @xmath17 rates determined both directly from nuclear reactions and from nucleosynthesis by weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) , the entropy carried off during @xmath14 burning in the stars of zams mass @xmath19 is substantial .",
    "the result is rather low - mass fe cores for these stars , which can evolve into neutron stars .",
    "note that in the literature earlier than weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) often large @xmath17 rates were used , so that the @xmath14 was converted into oxygen and the convective burning did not have time to be effective .",
    "thus its role was not widely appreciated .    of particular importance",
    "is the zams mass at which the convective carbon burning is skipped . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , this occurs at zams mass @xmath20 but with a slightly lower @xmath17 rate it might come at @xmath13 or higher . as the progenitor mass increases , it follows from general polytropic arguments that the entropy at a given burning stage increases . at the higher entropies of the more massive stars the density at which burning occurs is lower , because the temperature is almost fixed for a given fuel .",
    "lower densities decrease the rate of the triple-@xmath21 process which produces @xmath14 relative to the two - body @xmath17 which produces oxygen .",
    "therefore , at the higher entropies in the more massive stars the ratio of @xmath14 to @xmath22 at the end of he burning is lower .",
    "the star skips the long convective carbon burning and goes on to the much shorter oxygen burning .",
    "oxygen burning goes via @xmath23 giving various products , at very much higher temperature than @xmath24 and much faster .",
    "since neutrino cooling during the long carbon - burning phase gets rid of a lot of entropy of the core , skipping this phase leaves the core entropy higher and the final chandrasekhar core fatter .",
    "we believe that our above discussion indicates that single stars in the region of zams masses @xmath15 end up as high mass black holes .",
    "arguments have been given that sn 1987a with progenitor zams mass of @xmath25 evolved into a low - mass black hole ( brown & bethe 1994 ) .",
    "we believe from our above arguments that just above the zams mass of @xmath26 , single stars go into high - mass black holes without return of matter to the galaxy .",
    "thus , the region of masses for low - mass black hole formation in single stars is narrow , say @xmath27 ( although we believe it to be much larger in binaries ) .",
    "we believe that there are many main sequence stars more massive than the @xmath28 we used in our schematic evolution , which end up further away from the black hole and will fill their roche lobe during only subgiant or giant stage . from our evolution",
    ", we see that a @xmath29 main sequence star will end up about twice as far from the black hole as the @xmath30 , a @xmath31 star , three times as far , etc .",
    "two of the 9 systems in our table [ tab1 ] have subgiant donors ( v404 cyg and xn sco ) .",
    "these have the longest periods , 6.5 and 2.6 days and xn sco is suggested to have a relatively massive donor of @xmath32 .",
    "it seems clear that these donors sat inside their roche lobes until they evolved off the main sequence , and then poured matter onto the black hole once they expanded and filled their roche lobe . for a @xmath29 star ,",
    "the evolutionary time is about a percent of the main - sequence time , so the fact that we see two subgiants out of nine transient sources means that many more of these massive donors are sitting quietly well within their roche lobes .",
    "indeed , we could estimate from the relative time , that there are @xmath33 times more of these latter quiet main sequence stars in binaries .",
    "we have shown that it is likely that single stars in the range of zams masses @xmath15 evolve into high - mass black holes without return of matter to the galaxy .",
    "this results because at mass @xmath26 the convective carbon burning is skipped and this leads to substantially more massive fe cores .",
    "even with more realistic reduced mass loss rates on he stars , however , it is unlikely that stars in this mass range in binaries evolve into high - mass black holes , because the progenitor of the compact object when stripped of its hydrogen envelope in either case a ( during main sequence ) or case b ( rlof ) mass transfer will burn as a  naked \" he star , ending up as an fe core which is not sufficiently massive to form a high - mass black hole .    in the region of zams",
    "mass @xmath4 , depending sensitively on the rate of he - star wind loss , the fate of the single star or the primary in a binary may be a low - mass black hole . in our estimates we have assumed the brown & bethe ( 1994 ) estimates of @xmath34 for maximum neutron star mass and @xmath35 for the range in which low - mass black holes can result .    in our evolution of the transient sources using case c ( during he shell burning ) mass transfer , almost the entire he core will collapse into a high - mass black hole ( bethe , brown , & lee 1999 ) , explaining the more or less common black hole mass of @xmath12 for these objects , with the possible exception of v404 cygni where the mass may be greater .",
    "our evolution gives an explanation for the seemingly large gap in black - hole masses , between the @xmath36 for the black hole we believe was formed in 1987a and the @xmath37 black hole we suggest in 1700 - 37 and the @xmath12 in the transient sources .",
    "we note that following the removal of the h envelope by case c mass transfer , the collapse inwards of the he envelope into the developing black hole offers the collapsar scenario for the most energetic gamma ray bursters of macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) .",
