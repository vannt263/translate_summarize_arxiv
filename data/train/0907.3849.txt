    "microquasars are well known miniatures of quasars , with a central black hole ( bh ) , an accretion disk and two relativistic jets very similar to those found in the centers of active galaxies , only on much smaller scales ( mirabel @xmath3 rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "the typical timescales in these systems are also @xmath4 times shorter than those in quasars , thus evolutions of microquasar jets can be studied in details .",
    "therefore , microquasar systems have been considered ideal laboratories for understanding accretion process in black hole systems and might provide us a good alternative to study agn phenomena instead of observing them directly ( massi & kaufman bernad 2008 ) .    since discovered in 1992 , radio jets",
    "have been observed in a series of bh binary systems and several of them showed apparent superluminal features . in the two well known microquasars , grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel @xmath3 rodrguez 1999 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( tingay et al .",
    "1995 ; hjellming @xmath3 rupen 1995 ) , relativistic jets with actual velocities greater than 0.9@xmath5 were observed . in some other systems ,",
    "small - size  compact jets \" , e.g. cyg x-1 ( stirling et al . 2001 ) , and large scale diffuse emission , e.g. ss433 ( dubner et al . 1998 ) , were also detected .    among these microquasars ,",
    "xte j1550 - 564 is especially interesting since it was the first galactic accretion systems that a fast moving x - ray jet was detected .",
    "the large scale and long existing time of the jets have also made this source unique and valuable in jet studies .",
    "xte j1550 - 564 was discovered with rxte in 1998 during its strong x - ray outburst on september 7 ( smith 1998 ) .",
    "it is believed to be an x - ray binary system at a distance of @xmath15.3 kpc , containing a black hole of 10.5@xmath61.0 solar masses and a low mass companion star ( orosz et al .",
    "2002 ) . soon after the discovery of the source , a jet ejection with an apparent velocity greater than 2@xmath5 was reported by vlbi team ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the period between 1998 and 2002 , the source also exhibited strong x - ray activities but no similar radio and x - ray flares were detected again during these activities ( tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with the @xmath0 satellite , corbel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found two large scale x - ray jets lying to the east and west of the central source , which were also in good alignment with the central source .",
    "the eastern jet has been detected first in 2000 at a projected distance of @xmath121 arcsec and a position angle e of n of 93.8@xmath70.9@xmath8 from the central black hole .",
    "its apparent proper motion velocity has dropped from an average of @xmath132.9 mas / day between 1998 and 2000 to @xmath121.2 mas / day during its 2000 observations ; its x - ray flux also decayed quite rapidly .",
    "two years later , it could only be seen marginally in the x - ray image , while a western counterpart became visible at @xmath122 arcsec on the other side .",
    "the corresponding radio maps are consistent with the x - ray observations ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ) .    from the year 2002 to 2003",
    ", there were altogether five observations of this source in the @xmath0 archive .",
    "the eastern jet has disappeared from the x - ray images in late 2002 , while the western jet could be seen clearly in all the five observations , although the flux decayed quickly as well . among these observations ,",
    "only the first two have been reported and discussed previously ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; wang et al .",
    "we therefore use these additional data points to better constrain the kinematic and spectral analysis for the eastern jet , and to extend the analysis to the western jet .    in this paper",
    ", we first describe the observational data obtained by @xmath0 x - ray satellite in section 2 and 3 .",
    "then we propose a model for the system and discuss the kinematic and emission process in section 4 . finally in section 5 and 6",

    "the complex behaviors found in the 1998 outburst , such as irregular light curves and multiple state transitions , were not detected in other outbursts .",
    "the two x - ray jets are also found to be aligned with the 1998 radio jets ( corbel et al .",

    "based on the above arguments , we conclude that it is reasonable to assume that both the eastern and western jets originated from the same 1998 outburst .    our calculation results are listed in table 2 .",
    "a distance of approximately 23 arcsec is obtained for the western jet with a slowly increasing value ; errors are estimated following the method described by tomsick et al .",
    "we calculate the source centroid for the central source and the x - ray jet respectively and for all the five observations , the changes of the newly calculated position with the previous results are less than 0.5 . therefore , an upper limit of 0.5is set for the error of the jet distance ( except the eastern jet in observation 6 , where a larger error of 1 arcsec was set because of the manual selection method we applied ) .",
    "we divide the net angular separation by the time interval between the neighboring observations to estimate the average proper motion for the jets , and from the results , an approximate estimate of deceleration could be seen for both jets .",

    "it is interesting to notice from this figure that although the detailed properties of the binary systems ( e.g. , the compact objects and the companion stars ) differ a lot from source to source , the normalized jet proper motions are quite consistent .",
    "this is not surprising since the jet properties are set by the compact object ( and its immediate neighborhood ) and their evolutions are mostly influenced by the surrounding environment .",
    "although the companion star provides the material which is eventually launched into the jets , and thus affects the mass transfer rate and the mass flux in the jets , it nevertheless does not seem to play significant roles for the structure and evolution of the large scale jets and cavities surrounding the microquasar .",
    "therefore the nature of accretion disk physics dominates over the nurture of the companion star , as far as the jets are concerned .",
    "thus it leads us to the attempt to generalize the microquasar jets in one consistent picture .",
    "this figure , together with other observational data concerning the motionless large scale jets ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , ss433 ) , has led us to the suggestion that all microquasar jets can be classified into roughly three groups : small scale moving jets , large scale moving jets and large scale jet relics . for the first type , the  small jets \" , only radio emissions are detected .",
    "the jets are always relatively close to the central source and dissipate very quickly .",
    "examples of this class include grs 1915 + 105 ( rodrguez & mirabel 1999 ; miller - jones et al . 2007 ) , gro j1655 - 40 ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , and cyg x-3 ( mart et al . 2001 ) .",

    "no obvious deceleration is observed before the jets become too faint .",

    "the typical jet traveling distance for this type is 0.2@xmath10.5 pc from the central engine .",
    "deceleration is clearly observed in this type of sources .",
    "the last type , the  large relics \" , is a kind of diffuse structures observed in radio , optical and x - ray band , often ring or round nebula shaped that are not moving at all . in this class , some well studied sources , cygnus x-1 ( gallo et al .",
    "2005 ) , ss433 ( dubner el al .",
    "1998 ) , circinus x-1 ( stewart et al .",
    "1993 , tudose et al . 2006 ) and grs 1915 + 105 ( kaiser et al .",
    "2004 ) are included .",
    "the typical scale for this kind is 1@xmath130 pc , an order of magnitude larger than the second type .",
    "the estimated lifetime often exceeds one million years , indicating that they are related to previous outbursts .    from these properties",
    ", it is reasonable to further suggest a consistent picture involving all the sources together .",
    "we make a conjecture that extreme low density regions , or namely , large scale cavities , exist in all microquasar systems .",
    "the  small jets \" observed right after the ejection are just traveling through these cavities . since there are few or none interactions between the jets and the surrounding gas in this region , the jets travel without obvious deceleration .",
    "the emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation by particles accelerated in the initial outburst .",
    "the emissions of jets decay very quickly and are not detectable after several tens of days . in some cases ( e.g. xte j1550 - 564 ) , the cavity has a dense ( compared to the cavity ) boundary at some radius and the interactions between the jets and the boundary gas heat the particles again and thus make the jets detectable again .",
    "those are the  large jets \" .",
    "the emission mechanism then is synchrotron radiation by the re - heated particles in the external shocks .",
    "then , after these interactions , the jets lost most of their kinematic energy into the ism gradually , causing the latter to expand to large scale structures , the  large relics \" , in a comparatively long time ( thousands to several millions of years ) and create the observed nebula - like jet - inflated bubbles .",
    "different systems are allowed to fall into more than one of the three postulated groups .",
    "for example , cygnus x-1 has small - scale ejecta ( fender et al . , 2006 ) and also has a large - scale relic ( gallo et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "also xte j1550 - 564 has small - scale ejecta ( hannikainen et al . , 2001 ) and also large - scale jets ( corbel et al . , 2002",
    "as we proposed in the above paragraph , the three observational groups are perhaps just three stages in a complete ejection evolution process : the  small jets \" observed in the outburst events will travel in dark and manifest themselves as the  large jets \" when they hit the boundary of the cavity and eventually develop into the  large relics \" gradually by the continuous interactions and energy dissipation .",
    "if this conjecture holds , then the three groups may not be actually  three \" but just three phenomena in  one \" system . the three groups identified here are probably just observational manifestations of one generic mechanism , and different sources can belong to multiple groups .",
    "if this general model of microquasars is true , properties of different jet systems could be dealt with separately in one consistent scheme .",
    "one implication is that the electrons from the  large jet \" and the  small jets \" belong to different groups of electrons , from the ejecta itself and the ism respectively , which means we could not simply use the properties of electron distributions in the  large jet \" blobs to determine the emission properties of the central source in the ejection ( xue et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "one important remaining question would be why there are such vacuous regions and how to generate them .",
    "there are several possibilities , involving previous outbursts , jets or winds activities .",
    "before we go further into these possibilities , we should first distinguish one class from the others .",
    "we have used the term  cavity \" all through our discussion , but actually there are two geometric possibilities for a cavity .",
    "one is a  cavity \" , the other is a  tunnel \" . instead of a spherical cavity , it is possible that there is only a vacuum conical path outside the central engine .",
    "it may be created by previous jet ejection events and got fully developed through a series of ejections .",
    "this could explain the collimation of the jets naturally , but it requires almost continuous jet ejections ( contrary to the episodic jet ejections discussed here ) to prevent the surrounding gas to fall back and fill up the thin path between ejections .",
    "this assumption is of great interest because it provides a possible connection between the large - scale structures and the persistent , low - power , steady jets reported in several important observations ( etc .",

    "2001 ) and grs 1915 + 105 ( dhawan et al .",
    "kaiser and alexander ( 1997 , hereafter ka97 ) has developed a model for radio galaxies in which continuous and collimated jet may clear its way out and create a hot spot at the end of its path , and the hot electrons escaped from the shocks would form a  cocoon \" outside the central compact object . if this is also the case for galactic accretion systems , as postulated for cygnus x-1 ( gallo et al . , 2005 ) , circinus x-1 ( tudose et al . , 2006 ) , and grs 1915 + 105 ( kaiser et al . , 2004",
    ") , then the vacuous regions ( tunnel and cocoon ) and the  large relics \" are perhaps both the results of the continuous jets traveling in dark .",
    "the two galactic center sources 1e1740 - 294 and grs 1958 - 258 may also belong to this case . in this frame of assumptions , the episodic outbursts are not included here : the outbursts will increase the instantaneous mass flux down the jet , however since low - mass x - ray binaries spend the majority of their time in a low - luminosity quiescent state , the outbursts will have little effect on the time - averaged jet luminosity , and thus on the long - term evolution of the relics .",
    "however , we may infer that if there are dark continuous jets and dark relics in a system like xte j1550 - 564 , a strong episodic outburst would just hit and brighten the boundary of the relic and may provide a bridge between the source and the relic .",

    "however , whether the winds are powerful enough to create such large cavities in all cases for all sources is unclear at this stage .",
    "the terminal places of the wind shells ( which determine the size of the cavity ) are determined by the wind energy and geometry , specifically , the wind velocity at the ejection place and the opening angle , and the interaction conditions between winds and the gas .",
    "these parameters are still very uncertain nowadays because of the lack of enough studies and the densities of the winds are only estimated at the foot of the ejection place .",
    "we would roughly estimate that , in order for the wind to move to large radii far from the black hole , the wind velocity should be quite close to the escape velocity at the ejection radius . from table 5 , we can see that most of the observed wind velocities are comparable to , although not as large as , the local escape velocity , with the exception of the recently discovered disk wind of about its escape velocity in grs 1915 + 105 in its soft state , with mass loss rate sufficient to suppress jet ejection ( neilsen & lee 2009 ) . therefore in the last case",
    "the accretion disk wind alone ( because no jet is expected in the soft state ) may play a significant role for forming a large scale cavity .",
    "however for other cases the winds alone may not be enough to power the cavities , due to insufficient velocities .",
    "therefore some kinds of acceleration or velocity - maintaining mechanisms may be required , in order for the winds to expand far enough ( @xmath10.1 pc to 10 pc ) .",
    "magnetic fields may play an important role here .",
    "it has been known that rotating wind - up magnetic fields can accelerate and launch jets ( see spruit 2008 and references therein ) ; therefore continuous high velocity winds can set up the favorable condition for producing continuous outflows or jets with velocities around or even exceeding the escaping velocities of these systems .",
    "once continuous high velocity outflows or jets are produced , they should be able to inflate their surrounding interstellar medium to form bubbles , as we have discussed earlier within the framework of the ka97 model .",
    "finally , we comment that it seems counter intuitive that the boundary of the cavity lies further in the western side , yet the ism density is also higher in the west . it would be a problem if the cavity is produced by the observed large scale two - sided jets with equal power .",
    "therefore this asymmetry may be used to argue against such a model . however , the asymmetric cavity may be naturally produced if the system has a non - negligible space velocity with respect to the local ism along the eastern direction . in this case",
    "additional energy is injected into the ism on the head - on side along the direction of motion of the system , in analogy to process producing the head - on bow - shock of young spin - down powered pulsars moving in ism ( e.g. , caraveo et al 2003 ) .",
    "therefore the cavity on the approaching side should be emptier ( with smaller density ) than the opposite wind or jet , unless the system moves perpendicular to the wind or jet .",
    "the system itself is also catching up with the cavity on the approaching side , placing itself closer to the boundary of the cavity on the approaching side .",
    "for example , a space velocity of 100 km / s with respect to the local ism would displace the source by 0.1 pc in less than 1000 years . in the absence of data for this system on its proper motion and the power of wind or continuous ( dark ) jets",
    ", we will not speculate further on what combination of parameters may eventually produce the observed asymmetry of the cavity .",
    "this should be tested in the future .",
    "heinz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have proposed that the microquasar s space velocity should be important and leave trails behind their moving path in the galaxy .",
    "they estimated the volume of radio plasma released by these microquasars and claimed that they should be observable at low frequencies .",
    "future observational confirmation of their prediction for xte j1550 - 564 would provide evidence for our conjecture .",
    "two large - scale x - ray jets have been observed in xte j1550 - 564 . we have analyzed the @xmath0 x - ray data for these two jets and fitted their kinematics and light curves with the external shock model in the grb afterglow model . in this model ,",
    "the interactions between the jet material and the surrounding ism slow the jets down and accelerate the jet particles to radiate the observed radio and x - ray synchrotron radiations . under such assumptions ,",
    "the number density of the ism in the surrounding regions of the central black hole is a key parameter .",
    "we found in the fitting that this number density has to be extremely low , or the strong interactions would block the jet s expansion . however on the other hand , the number density at @xmath120 arcsec has to be comparatively high ( but still lower than the typical ism ) in order to allow the jet to be decelerated quickly , as the observational data indicated .",
    "thus , a model consisting of two different regions , a cavity and its gas boundaries , is tested and shown to work well .",
    "the cavity is found to be large scale ( @xmath10.4 pc in size ) and asymmetric ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the reason of the asymmetry of the environment on the two sides is not clear from current observational data .",
    "the deceleration described in the model is quite obvious ( from @xmath48 to @xmath163 at @xmath164 days ) , thus it is the first time that we observe the whole process of the deceleration of a pair of relativistic jets .",
    "the similar analysis of h1743 - 322 also supports this jet - ism interaction scenario .",
    "large scale decelerating jets are also observed in this source and the interaction model describes the data consistently .",
    "whether a cavity exists is not clear in this case ; nevertheless the density is also found to be very low , compared to the canonical galactic value .    with these studies , a generic model of the environment of microquasars is proposed .",
    "we suggest that microquasars are located in large scale and very low density cavities .",
    "the cavity provides the space for the jets to go through freely and the interactions between the jets and the material outside the cavity provide the deceleration mechanism of the jets .",
    "the cavity is likely created by continuous high velocity outflows or jets , which are seeded by accretion disk winds that have been observed in several microquasar systems producing strong absorption lines .",
    "microquasars are powerful probes of both the central engine and their surrounding environment",
    ". more studies of the jets behaviors may give us information on the ism gas properties , as well as the ejecta components .",
    "the link between jets and wind is a key issue in current studies of accreting systems .",
    "if the general scenario we have proposed here is further confirmed , we then need to understand the mechanism producing these outflows ( winds and jets ) and the connections between them .",
    "detailed analysis of the geometry and timing properties of the ejecta in the future would be of great significance ; it will not only provide insights of the jet formation process , but also offer another approach into black hole physics and accretion flow dynamics .",

    "<S> the black hole x - ray transient xte j1550 - 564 has undergone a strong outburst in 1998 and two relativistic x - ray jets have been detected years later with the @xmath0 x - ray observatory ; the eastern jet was found previously to have decelerated after its first detection . </S>",

    "<S> the best fitted radius of the cavity is @xmath10.31 pc on the eastern side and @xmath10.44 pc on the western side , and the densities also show asymmetry , of @xmath10.034 @xmath2 on the east to @xmath10.12 @xmath2 on the west . </S>",
