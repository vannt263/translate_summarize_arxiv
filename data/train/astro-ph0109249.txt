    "exploring the era when the first stars formed by locating high redshift sources with demonstrably young cosmic ages represents the next outstanding challenge for observational cosmology ( mather & stockman 2000 ) .",
    "although luminous quasars ( zheng et al 2000 , fan et al 2000 , 2001 ) and star - forming galaxies ( dey et al 1998 , weymann et al 1998 , spinrad et al 1998 , hu et al 1999 ) have been located beyond @xmath85 , to be detected these must be spectacularly luminous and rare examples drawn from a largely unknown underlying population ( for an excellent review of attempts to find very distant galaxies , see stern & spinrad 1999 ) .",
    "gravitational magnification by foreground clusters of galaxies , whose mass distributions are constrained by arcs and multiple images of known redshift , has already provided new information on the abundance of faint background objects ( kneib et al 1996 ) .",
    "particularly high magnifications ( @xmath940 ) are expected in the _ critical regions _ which can be located precisely in well - understood clusters for sources occupying specific redshift ranges , e.g. @xmath107 .",
    "although the volumes probed in this way are smaller than those addressed in panoramic narrow band surveys ( hu et al 1998 , malhotra et al 2001 ) , intrinsically much fainter and most likely more representative sources are sampled .",
    "if the surface density of such sources is sufficient , this may be a promising route for securing the first glimpse of young cosmic sources beyond @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , we have begun a blind spectroscopic survey of the appropriate critical lines of several well - constrained lensing clusters with hubble space telescope images ( santos et al 2001 ) .",
    "briefly , our strategy involves undertaking long - slit scans of regions 7 @xmath11 120 arcsec in extent with the keck i low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al 1995 ) , using gratings that offer a spectral resolution of @xmath124   in the oh forest and @xmath126   in the blue .",
    "the typical wavelength range covered is @xmath133500 - 9350   offering the potential of seeing lensed ly @xmath0 sources in the important range 2@xmath147 . with a 1.0 arcsec slit ,",
    "the dwell at each location is normally 2 @xmath11 1000sec .    in the course of surveying the cluster abell 2218 ( @xmath1=0.18 ) on 23 april 2001 we encountered a strong emission line at @xmath157989   close to the central cd ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "astrometry associates this emission with a faint , marginally - resolved , source in the early release wfpc2 f814w image ( labelled _ a _ in figure 1 ) with @xmath16=25.9 @xmath17 0.2 .",
    "inspection of kneib et al s ( 1996 ) mass model suggests that a second image with @xmath1826.0 @xmath17 0.3 , 6 arcsec away ( _ b _ in figure 1 ) , represents a counter - image of the same highly magnified @xmath195 source .    on may 21 , 2001 we used the keck ii echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi , scheinis et al 2000 ) at a higher spectral resolution ( @xmath12 1.25   ) with a 0.75 arcsec slit aligned to include both images ( see inset panel in figure 1 ) . with 2 @xmath11 2000",
    "sec exposures , strong emission was confirmed from _ both _ images ( figure 3a ) .",
    "the spectra are identical ( to within the signal / noise ) confirming the lensing hypothesis .",
    "importantly , the magnitude difference in the emission lines ( @xmath200.2@xmath170.1 ) is comparable to that in the @xmath16 photometry .",
    "the combined flux - calibrated spectrum ( figure 3b ) reveals a single emission line with an asymmetric ( p cygni - like ) profile suggestive of gas outflow .",
    "the location and separation of the images was already suggestive of lensing of a high redshift source consistent with emission arising from ly@xmath0 at @xmath1=5.576 ( corresponding to the peak in the combined spectrum at @xmath157996   ) .",
    "were the emission to arise from @xmath21 , the images have to be a physically associated pair just behind the cluster and the absence of other emission would be puzzling given the extensive lris wavelength coverage .",
    "the most plausible alternative to ly@xmath0 for a lone emission line would be [ oii ] at @xmath1=1.14 . this can be eliminated not only by lensing arguments ( c.f . the location of the critical lines and image configurations expected in figure 1 ) , but also by the fact the [ oii ] 3726 , 3728   doublet would be readily resolved at the spectral resolution of esi .",
    "* figure 1 : *    * figure 2 : *    * figure 3 : *",
    "the remarkable features of the @xmath1=5.576 source are its faintness ( particularly considering the high magnification afforded by its proximity to the critical line ) , its small angular size in the hst image , and the apparent absence of any stellar continuum in both the lris and esi spectra .",
    "the magnification of the two images in figure 1b can be determined from the abell 2218 mass model ( kneib et al 1996 ) which has been extensively tested via spectroscopy of 18 arclets by ebbels et al ( 1999 ) . in this model ,",
    "the magnifications for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively 3.8 mag ( @xmath1133.1 ) and 3.7 mag ( @xmath1130.2 ) implying a ( unlensed ) source magnitude of @xmath1829.7 .",
    "inspection of the dithered wfpc2 image indicates that image @xmath22 is marginally resolved along the shear direction ( i.e. towards the other image ) .",
    "the appropriate half - light scales are 0.23 @xmath11 @xmath30.15 arcsec .",
    "allowing for the hst resolution and the linear magnification at this point in the cluster s gravitational field implies a physical diameter of less than 150 @xmath4 pc.=0.3 and @xmath24=0.7 througout . ]",
    "the lensing model also offers insight into the crucial question of whether we are witnessing magnification of an isolated object or a star - forming component ( e.g. a hii region ) embedded in a more extended source close to a caustic .",
    "the mass model indicates that the source that produces the pair lies 1.2 kpc from the caustic .",
    "thus any comparable emitting region ( containing line or continuum flux ) within this distance would also be highly magnified and possibly detected .",
    "together with the remarkably small physical size , this suggests the source is a truly isolated system and not , for example , a star forming sub - component of a larger luminous system ( c.f .",
    "franx et al 1997 , trager et al 1997 ) .",
    "a substantial component of the broad - band @xmath25-band flux arises from the line emission suggesting that the stellar continuum is unusually faint .",
    "if the f814w flux were produced by a single emission line at @xmath157989 , the flux density in the line would be @xmath26=1.2 @xmath17 0.2 10@xmath27 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29 .",
    "this is only 70% higher than the mean inferred from the esi spectra , corrected for extinction : @xmath30= 6.8@xmath170.7 10@xmath31 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29 .",
    "the esi line flux is consistent , within uncertainties of absolute calibration , with that inferred for @xmath22 in the lris data : @xmath32=5.6 @xmath17 0.5 10@xmath31 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29 .",
    "limits on any stellar continuum flux can be explored further in the lris wavelength region @xmath1390209297   which is relatively free from oh contamination ( figure 2 ) . including the noise across the lris slit at this location we deduce a 3@xmath33 upper limit to the continuum flux of 3.@xmath34 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29   @xmath29 . assuming a flat spectrum longward of ly@xmath0 , this upper limit integrated over the f814w bandpass would also yield a signal comparable to the emission line flux",
    ".    limited near - infrared data is available for abell 2218 from commissioning data taken with the ingrid infrared camera on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( supplied by courtesy of ian smail ) .",
    "image @xmath22 remains undetected to limits of @xmath35=22.5 and @xmath36=21.5 ( 5@xmath33 for a point source ) . at respective rest - frame wavelengths @xmath371600 and 3350   , neither filter is likely to be contaminated by a strong emission lines . these non - detections give further constraints on the continuum flux , viz .",
    "@xmath38 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29   @xmath29 and @xmath39 ergs @xmath28 sec@xmath29 @xmath29 .",
    "we summarize the properties of the source detected in abell 2218 in table  1 .",
    "although our observed line flux is comparable to those in sources seen at lower redshift in narrow band searches ( hu et al 1998 ) , when lensing is taken into account the true source flux is much fainter .",

    "we now address the interesting question of whether the source lensed by abell 2218 is being observed at a special time in its history , perhaps consistent with its first generation of stars . although the ly@xmath0 line is an unreliable guide to the ongoing star formation rate because of self - absorption , scattering and dust extinction difficulties , will argue that uncertainties arising from this diagnostic most likely strengthen our conclusions .    adopting the relationship 1 @xmath7 yr@xmath29 = 1.5 10@xmath49 ergs sec@xmath29 in ly@xmath0 ( ferland & osterbrock 1985 , kennicutt 1998 , osterbrock 1989 , ) and including a magnification of 33 with a 100% escape fraction and zero extinction , we infer a current star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.5 @xmath7 yr@xmath29 .",
    "we consider this a lower limit given the conservative assumptions above .",
    "although our physical scale of @xmath3150pc is comparable to that resolved for 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( scowen et al 1998 ) , the sfr is over an order of magnitude larger than the integrated value for energetic giant h ii regions contained within nearby star - forming galaxies ( mckee & williams 1997 ) .",
    "consistent with its isolated nature , the source appears to be a very powerful extragalactic hii region with a luminosity @xmath5010@xmath49 ergs sec@xmath29 ( c.f .",
    "melnick et al 2000 ) .    at @xmath1=5.576 , in our adopted cosmology ,",
    "the cosmic age is only 1 gyr . we ran the starburst99 code ( leitherer et al 1999 ) for a metal - poor ( @xmath51=10@xmath52 ) system with a constant sfr of 0.5 @xmath7 yr@xmath29 in order to explore at what age a detectable stellar continuum would emerge in the lris spectral window ( @xmath53=13701415   ) .",
    "ignoring dust extinction , this provides a tighter constraint than the same calculation applied to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 band limits at their longer rest wavelengths . for our",
    "adopted upper limit of @xmath5410@xmath55 ergs @xmath28   @xmath29 ( see  2 ) , the appropriate unlensed continuum luminosity , @xmath56 ergs sec@xmath29   @xmath29 , would be exceeded at the observed sfr in less than 2 myr suggesting the object could be remarkably young with a stellar mass @xmath57 .    if the sfr were higher in the past , or if the ly@xmath0 emission were subject to upward corrections due to self - absorption , the implied age for the continuum flux limit would be even shorter . although we can not yet provide any observable constraints on dust extinction , given the ly@xmath0 line is more likely to be suppressed than the adjacent continuum , this would also imply that we have _ overestimated _ the age and implied stellar mass .",
    "hierarchical models of structure formation predict a high density of systems undergoing their first era of star formation at @xmath86 ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) .",
    "our critical line survey ( santos et al 2001 ) will provide new constraints on their abundance and redshift distribution out to @xmath87 . in particular , the example discussed here could not have been detected without the lensing boost afforded by abell 2218 .",
    "its unlensed equivalent would not have been reliably detected even in the hubble deep field .",
    "the most interesting suggestion arising from our study is the possible young age inferred from our upper limit on the stellar continuum in the context of the star formation rate deduced from the ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "while there are many uncertainties in this deduction , we argue they work in the sense of strengthening the conclusion .",
    "if our upper age limit is correct , very deep infrared imaging would be needed to reliably probe the spectral energy distribution of this source longward of 1 @xmath58 m , i.e. in the rest - frame optical .",
    "depending on the star formation history , lensed 2@xmath58 m fluxes of 50 njy ( @xmath5925 ) are expected .",
    "an unlensed analog would have a flux density of only 1 njy and would clearly be challenging even for ngst .",
    "hii regions of stellar mass of order 10@xmath6 @xmath7 with star formation rates of @xmath12 1@xmath7 yr@xmath29 can be found at lower redshifts .",
    "the significance of the system in abell 2218 lies in the fact that an isolated , possibly young , low mass system has been located close to the redshift at which many now believe re - ionization may be occurring ( djorgovski et al 2001 , becker et al 2001 ) . just as with those constraints which sample a few ( possibly atypical ) sightlines to a distant quasar , so the stellar history of further examples of our star - forming source , located with the aid of strong lensing , will provide an early census of such systems beyond @xmath85 .    we thank fred chaffee , carlos frenk and hyron spinrad for their encouragement and acknowledge useful discussions with andrew benson , claus leitherer , dan stern , tommaso treu and pieter van dokkum .",

    "ian smail is thanked for access to the wht infrared observations .",
