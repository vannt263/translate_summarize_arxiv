    "n - body problem is a classical problem in mathematics and celestial mechanics . since euler s collinear solutions and lagrange s equilateral triangle solutions , any more `` clearly '' ( including the existence and the shape of the orbit ) solutions",
    "have not been found except figure - eight solution , a planer three - body orbits with equal masses , which was proved strictly by chenciner and montgomery in @xcite in 1999 .",
    "this remarkable and interesting orbit arouse many authors curiosity in studying more choreography orbits or other interesting symmetric constraints acting on the orbits of n - body problems , see , etc .",
    "furthermore , some investigations of a possible star system in real space have been performed in practice ( see @xcite ) .    among those authors studies ,",
    "the variational approach and the theory of critical points perform an important role . by minimizing the lagrangian action on a space of loops symmetry with respect to a well - chosen symmetry group , which also has some simple conditions on it ,",
    "ferrario and terracini give a fairly general condition on symmetry groups of the loop space in @xcite .",
    "but their results `` are not suitable to prove the existence of those orbits that are found as minimizers in classes of paths characterized by homotopy conditions or a mixture of symmetry and homotopy conditions '' .",
    "a further study based on @xcite is carried by shibayama to distinguish the solutions , which have been obtained by shibayama in @xcite and some of which by chen in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the figure - eight constraint carefully in section [ se3 ] , and draw a conclusion that even bodies with equivariant shift on figure - eight will collide at least on the original point , and odd bodies will not collide in a dense subset of @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "then in section [ se4 ] , we compose figure - eight from simple to double ( or more , that we do not describe in this paper ) by setting odd bodies on them reasonably . and in section [ se5 ] , it is practical to mix figure - eight with other constraints on @xmath1 in space . then along gordon and zelati s @xcite line , in section [ se6 ] ,",
    "we have proved the existence of generalized solutions and non - linear solutions for these periodic orbits .",
    "the numerical study in section [ se4 ] highly enlightens us that we can arrange many ( even or odd ) bodies on figure - eight by choosing an appropriate _",
    "phase differences_. obviously , all the study is based on figure - eight constraint , hence this paper is a continued study on chenciner and montgomery s significant work .",
    "the periodic solutions for n - body problem is described by the following second order ordinary differential equations in general : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of @xmath5th body , @xmath6 is the position of @xmath5th body in @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the number of bodies , @xmath9 is the period , and generally the singular potential function @xmath10 is @xmath11 with assumptions : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15    where @xmath16 is usually described by @xmath17 when @xmath18 in ( [ uil1 ] ) , it is called _ newton _ n - body problem . the figures , as the numerical examples to illuminate the existence of the solutions in this paper , are all coming from newton n - body problem .",
    "poincar has shown that it is impossible for @xmath19 to find an explicit expression for the general solution .",
    "so even for the three - body problem , it is impossible to describe all the solutions .",
    "then the numerical approach and/or endowing orbits with some symmetric constraints are quite reasonable directions for the study in n - body problem .",
    "no matter which direction adopted by the authors it is , the lagrangian @xmath20 @xmath21 acts an important role in their study in finding the periodic solutions for n - body problems .    in one direction , finding some symmetric orbits , chenciner and montgomery have introduced a new `` torsional '' symmetric constraint to the possible orbits for three - body problem with equal masses in 1999 .",
    "the `` torsional '' symmetry is described by the following expressions :    let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the orbit of the @xmath5-th body is @xmath24    @xmath25,\\ ] ]    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generators of the action of klein group @xmath30 on @xmath31 and on @xmath32 :    @xmath33    @xmath34    by the constraints ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) , the existence is proved in @xcite for three equal masses with the exclusion of collision .",
    "it is called simple choreography orbits , figure - eight solution . after that , many choreography / choreographies solutions are found numerically by many authors , e.g. sim , arioli , barutello and terracini @xcite etc .",
    "one of the facile development to simple choreography is considering more bodies on the same figure - eight .",
    "we can develop ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) by @xmath35 @xmath36.\\ ] ] hence , ( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) describe @xmath8 bodies on the same figure - eight with equivalent shift @xmath37 . by ( [ e3 ] )",
    ", one can deduce that @xmath38 @xmath39 when we set @xmath40 , @xmath41 it shows that @xmath42 is an odd function .",

    "it is reasonable to make a further strict assumption , a  simple \" orbits constraint , on figure - eight .",
    "we set the further _ simple _ figure - eight assumption : @xmath59 it means that the choreography orbit of @xmath60 has one and only one _ self - intersection _ on figure - eight .",

    "we consider some two choreographies orbits , the double - eight orbits , which arises from figure - eight . with this idea , one can also figure out other more choreographies orbits .",
    "we describe the following double - eight orbits as an example for n - body problem .    based on the aforementioned results , we set @xmath80 and @xmath81 are all odd in @xmath82 , and the number of bodies is @xmath83",
