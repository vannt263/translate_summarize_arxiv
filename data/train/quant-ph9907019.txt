    "the receiver is not interested in the exact message .",
    "he only wants to know if the sent message is a special one he is interested in .",
    "the authors gave a nice proof that under these constraints there are codes with doubly exponential size in the block length of the codewords .",
    "even though this was a big surprise , it is ( at least technically ) much harder to give a satisfying converse to this coding theorem .",

    "( the discussion of other interesting code models may be found in @xcite . ) + the goal of this paper is to study the i d scheme for the case of the information being transfered by a quantum channel .",
    "we give a coding theorem and a strong converse theorem for i d coding schemes that use measurements which may be used to identify every message .",
    "this means that the measurement the receiver has to perform to access the information is not allowed to depend on the message he s actually interested in .",
    "+ investigation in quantum channels started in the 1960 s ( see @xcite for a list of references ) , leading to holevo s famous upper bound ( @xcite ) which implies immediately a weak converse for the transmission problem of the memoryless quantum channel . even though it was undoubted that the appropriate coding theorem holds it was not before 1996 when people were able to prove this direct part of the coding theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "today it s also known that the strong converse holds ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and that things work for non - stationary quantum channels , too ( @xcite ) .",

    "we formulate a second code model for which there has to be one single ( simultaneous ) measurement which allows to identify every message at the same time .",
