    "in the 1970 s bass and serre developed the theory of groups acting on simplicial trees ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , they proved that if a finitely generated group @xmath1 acts on a simplicial tree non - trivially ( i.e. , without a global fixed point ) and without edge inversions , then @xmath1 splits as the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups , where vertex groups are proper subgroups of @xmath1 . since then there has been a lot of interest in establishing similar results for actions on more general ( non - simplicial ) trees .",
    "for example , gillet and shalen @xcite proved that if @xmath2 is a subgroup of @xmath0 of @xmath3-rank @xmath4 , then any finitely presented group admitting a non - trivial action without inversions on a @xmath2-tree splits ( as an amalgamated product or an hnn - extension ) over a proper subgroup .    in the case",
    "when @xmath5 , the first breakthrough was due to rips , who laid the foundation for the theory of groups acting on @xmath0-trees .",
    "in particular , he proved that if a finitely presented group @xmath1 admits a free isometric action on an @xmath0-tree then @xmath1 is isomorphic to the free product of free abelian and surface groups . even though rips never published his work on this topic , two different proofs of rips s theorem for finitely generated groups",
    "appear in the paper of bestvina and feighn @xcite and in the paper @xcite of gaboriau , levitt and paulin .",
    "in @xcite bestvina and feighn generalized rips s theory to cover non - free actions .",
    "more precisely , they proved that if a finitely presented group @xmath1 acts non - trivially and stably on some @xmath0-tree @xmath6 , then @xmath1 splits over an extension @xmath7-by - finitely generated abelian group , where @xmath7 fixes an arc of @xmath6 . here",
    "the action is called _ stable _ if every non - degenerate subtree @xmath8 of @xmath6 contains a non - degenerate subtree @xmath9 such that the pointwise stabilizer @xmath10 , of any non - degenerate subtree @xmath11 , coincides with the pointwise stabilizer @xmath12 , of @xmath13 in @xmath1 ( e.g. , this happens if for any descending chain of arcs in @xmath14 in @xmath6 , there is @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 ) .",
    "the next important contribution to this theory was made by sela @xcite .",
    "he showed that if a freely indecomposable finitely generated group @xmath1 acts non - trivially and super - stably on an @xmath0-tree @xmath6 with trivial tripod stabilizers then @xmath6 has a particular structure and @xmath1 has an associated decomposition as a fundamental group of a graph of groups ( for the definition of super - stability see @xcite ) . in a more recent work @xcite",
    ", guirardel gave an example showing that super - stability is a necessary assumption in sela s theorem ; he also generalized this result by substituting some of its assumptions with weaker ones .",
    "as the above results show , in many cases the existence of a non - trivial action of a group @xmath1 on an @xmath0-tree ( or a @xmath2-tree ) @xmath6 implies that @xmath1 has a non - trivial splitting , and thus it acts non - trivially on the simplicial bass - serre tree associated to this splitting .",
    "in fact , shalen @xcite asked whether this is true in general , i.e. , if every finitely generated group admitting a non - trivial action on an @xmath0-tree also admits a non - trivial action ( without edge inversions ) on some simplicial tree . a clear indication that the answer to this question should be negative was given by dunwoody in @xcite , who constructed an example of a finitely generated group which has a non - trivial unstable action on some @xmath0-tree with finite cyclic arc stabilizers , but can not act non - trivially on a simplicial tree with small edge stabilizers ( although , as observed in @xcite , this group does possess a non - trivial action on some simplicial tree ) .",
    "recall that a group @xmath1 is said to have serre s property ( fa ) if any simplicial action of @xmath1 on a simplicial tree ( by isometries and without edge inversions ) fixes a vertex ; similarly , @xmath1 has property ( f@xmath0 ) if it can not act non - trivially on any @xmath0-tree .",
    "clearly ( f@xmath0 ) implies ( fa ) , and shalen s question above asks whether the converse is true for finitely generated groups .",
    "the aim of this work is to produce counterexamples to this question .",
    "more precisely , our main result is the following :    [ thm : main ] there exists a finitely generated group @xmath18 which has property ( fa ) and admits a non - trivial action on some @xmath0-tree @xmath6 , such that the arc stabilizers for this action are finite .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 is not a quotient of any finitely presented group with property ( fa ) .",
    "the theorem of sela @xcite mentioned above implies that a finitely generated group which acts non - trivially on an @xmath0-tree with trivial arc stabilizers can not have ( fa ) , and guirardel s work @xcite shows that the same is true if one allows finite arc stabilizers of bounded size .",
    "in theorem [ thm : main ] the stabilizers of a nested sequence of arcs will normally form a strictly increasing sequence of finite groups , in particular the action of @xmath18 on @xmath6 is unstable .",
    "nonetheless , our construction is sufficiently flexible and allows to ensure that the finite arc stabilizers have some extra properties . for example",
    ", one can take them to be @xmath19-groups ( see theorem  [ thm : small_arc_stab ] and the discussion above lemma [ lem : k_j ] in section [ sec : m ] ) .",
    "the last claim of theorem [ thm : main ] can be compared with the fact that any finitely generated group with property ( f@xmath0 ) _ is _ a quotient of a finitely presented group with this property ( this follows from a theorem of culler and morgan @xcite establishing the compactness of the space of projective length functions for non - trivial actions of any given finitely generated group on @xmath0-trees ; different proofs of this fact , using ultralimits , were given by gromov @xcite and stalder @xcite ) .",
    "the pair @xmath20 from theorem [ thm : main ] is constructed as the limit of a strongly convergent sequence @xmath21 , where each @xmath22 is a group splitting as a free amalgamated product over a finite subgroup and @xmath23 is the bass - serre tree associated to this splitting .",
    "the morphism from @xmath23 to @xmath24 is not simplicial ( but it is a morphism of @xmath0-trees ) , as it starts with edge subdivision and then applies a sequence of edge folds ( see section [ sec : folding_seq ] ) .",
    "we analyze this morphism carefully in order to control the arc stabilizers for the resulting action of @xmath18 on @xmath6 .",
    "the construction of @xmath22 uses an auxiliary group @xmath25 satisfying certain properties ( see - below ) .",
    "the main technical content of the paper is in section [ sec : m ] , where we construct a suitable group @xmath25 using small cancellation theory over hyperbolic groups , and in section [ sec : strong_conv ] , where we prove that the corresponding sequence @xmath21 is strongly convergent ( in the sense of gillet and shalen @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] also shows that finite presentability is a necessary assumption in the result of gillet and shalen mentioned above ( when the @xmath26-rank of @xmath2 is @xmath4 ) , because the group @xmath18 can be seen to act non - trivially on a @xmath27-tree , where @xmath27 denotes the group of dyadic rationals  see remark [ rem : dyadic ] below .",
    "however , we start this paper with a short and elementary proof that finitely generated groups which have ( fa ) but do not have ( f@xmath0 ) exist , a fact first proved in our preprint @xcite with m. dunwoody ,  see section [ sec : short ] . it is based on the idea that it is possible to avoid many technicalities required for the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] if one is ready to give up the control over the limit @xmath0-tree . indeed , the amalgamated products @xmath22 and the epimorphisms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , can be constructed in a purely algebraic way starting from any finitely generated group @xmath25 with the first two properties , below , and is enough to ensure that the direct limit @xmath30 has property ( fa ) . the fact that @xmath18 acts non - trivially on some @xmath0-tree @xmath31 can be established by using the general ` existence ' result of culler and morgan @xcite mentioned above ( in contrast",
    ", the construction of the @xmath0-tree @xmath6 from theorem [ thm : main ] is quite explicit ) .",
    "this also gives an extra benefit that the auxiliary group @xmath25 is easier to construct , as it does not have to satisfy the last property ( which is needed to prove that the convergence of @xmath21 is strong ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of this approach is that we have no control over the arc stabilizers for the action of @xmath18 on the @xmath0-tree @xmath31 .",
    "* acknowledgement . *",
    "the author is grateful to gilbert levitt and yves de cornulier for their comments on the first version of this article , and to the referee for giving many useful remarks and suggestions .",
    "in this section we will present a short proof of a simplification of theorem [ thm : main ] , which gives no information about arc stabilizers :    [ thm : short ] there exists a finitely generated group @xmath18 which has property ( fa ) and admits a non - trivial action on some @xmath0-tree , i.e. , @xmath18 does not have ( f@xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 is not a quotient of any finitely presented group with property ( fa ) .    the first proof of theorem [ thm : short ] appeared in the preprint @xcite in 2012 .",
    "unfortunately this article was subsequently withdrawn from arxiv , due to a disagreement between its authors and will not be published .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : short ] given in this section is inspired by the ideas from @xcite , which were obtained in collaboration of the author with m. dunwoody .",
    "however , the construction here is quite different from the one in @xcite , as it uses a single base group @xmath25 with property ( fa ) instead of a sequence of such groups , which allows to shorten the proof of the property ( fa ) for the limit group @xmath18 .",
    "moreover our argument below is purely group - theoretic and , unlike the proof from @xcite , it does not require any familiarity with the theory of tree foldings .",
    "finally , the folding sequence employed in @xcite can not be used to produce a strong limit of simplicial trees , which is an essential ingredient in our proof of the main result ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .      given a group @xmath1 , a subset @xmath32 and elements @xmath33 , throughout the paper we will employ the notation @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we will also use @xmath36 to denote the set of natural numbers @xmath37 ( without zero ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : short ] will make use of a finitely generated group @xmath25 , containing a strictly ascending sequence of subgroups @xmath38 together with elements @xmath39 , @xmath29 , such that the following two conditions are satisfied for all @xmath29 :    * *    [ ( p1 ) ]    @xmath40 centralizes @xmath41 in @xmath25 ;    * *    [ ( p2 ) ]    @xmath42 .    for each @xmath29 ,",
    "let @xmath43 be a copy of @xmath25 with a fixed isomorphism @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the amalgamated free product of @xmath25 and @xmath43 , given by the following presentation : @xmath46      the next lemma defines an epimorphism from @xmath22 to @xmath47 and lists some of its properties .",
    "[ lem : fold_props ] for each @xmath29 there is a unique homomorphism @xmath48 such that @xmath49    moreover , the homomorphism @xmath50 has the following properties :    * the restrictions of @xmath50 to @xmath51 and to @xmath52 are injective , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; * @xmath28 is surjective ; * @xmath55 .    by the universal property of amalgamated free products ,",
    "to verify that the homomorphism @xmath50 satisfying exists , we just need to check that it is well - defined on the amalgamated subgroup @xmath56 .",
    "so , suppose that @xmath57 for some @xmath58 .",
    "then , recalling that @xmath59 in @xmath47 by definition and @xmath60 in @xmath25 by , we get @xmath61 thus @xmath62 , as required .",
    "evidently the homomorphism @xmath48 , satisfying , is unique because @xmath22 is generated by @xmath25 and @xmath43 .",
    "claim ( i ) follows immediately from the definition of @xmath50 .",
    "now , the group @xmath63 is generated by @xmath64 and @xmath65 by condition , which implies that in @xmath47 one has @xmath66 yielding claim ( ii ) . to prove claim ( iii ) , notice that @xmath67 because @xmath68 and @xmath69 by claim ( i ) .    since @xmath70 ,",
    "there is a ` nave ' epimorphism @xmath71 , which restricts to the identity map on @xmath25 and to the composition @xmath72 on @xmath43 .",
    "however , this is _ different _ from the epimorphism @xmath28 described above : for example , by claim ( i ) of lemma [ lem : fold_props ] , @xmath50 sends both @xmath25 and @xmath43 to conjugates of @xmath25 , while @xmath73 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that these ` nave ' epimorphisms are actually useless for the purposes of this paper .",

    "for @xmath74 , let @xmath75 denote the composition @xmath76 ( thus @xmath77 ) .",
    "we also define @xmath78 to be the identity map .",
    "the sequence of groups @xmath22 , equipped with the epimorphisms @xmath79 , forms a directed family which has a direct limit , denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "this means that for each @xmath29 there is an epimorphism @xmath80 such that @xmath81    in this section we will show that @xmath18 has property ( fa ) , provided the same holds for @xmath25 .",
    "so , assume that , in addition to and , the group @xmath25 satisfies    * *    [ ( p3 ) ]    @xmath25 has property ( fa ) .",

    "since the tree @xmath8 is simplicial , we can choose @xmath29 so that @xmath91 is minimal , where @xmath92 denotes the standard simplicial metric on @xmath8 .    if @xmath93 then it is fixed by both @xmath94 and @xmath95 . but @xmath18 is generated by these two subgroups , as @xmath96 and so @xmath97 where we used together with claim ( i ) of lemma [ lem : fold_props ] . hence @xmath98 .",

    "the latter is a straightforward exercise .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath121 is generated by four elements @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( see @xcite ) , defined as follows :    @xmath143    @xmath144    fix any @xmath29 .",

    "the properties and of lemma [ lem : k_j ] imply that @xmath730 is injective on @xmath731 and @xmath658 , therefore we will identify @xmath731 and its elements with their images in @xmath25 for every @xmath732 .",

    "take any @xmath555 and consider any @xmath735 in @xmath25 .",
    "then , by condition , the element @xmath671 will have infinite order in @xmath632 and the cyclic subgroup generated by this element will be contained in @xmath658 .",
    "since the epimorphism @xmath730 is injective on @xmath658 , we can conclude that @xmath736 has infinite order in @xmath25 .",
    "clearly @xmath737 , thus the subgroup @xmath738 is infinite .",
    "one can also note that the element @xmath739 is a cyclic conjugate of @xmath740 in @xmath25 .",

    "the group @xmath18 is finitely generated and acts on @xmath6 non - trivially by isometries with finite arc stabilizers by theorem  [ thm : small_arc_stab ] , since each @xmath426 is a finite group by construction ( see section  [ sec : m ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 has property ( fa ) by lemma [ lem:(fa ) ] .    finally , if @xmath168 is a finitely presented group then any epimorphism from @xmath168 to @xmath18 factors through some epimorphism @xmath742 for some @xmath29 , because @xmath18 is the direct limit of the groups @xmath22 ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) for a proof of this fact ) .",
    "therefore @xmath168 inherits from @xmath22 a non - trivial action on the bass - serre tree @xmath23 ( corresponding to the splitting of @xmath22 as an amalgamated free product ) , and thus @xmath168 does not have ( fa ) .",
    "[ rem : dyadic ] recall that , by construction , each @xmath22 acts on the simplicial @xmath0-tree @xmath23 , @xmath29 , where the length of an edge is set to be @xmath743 . since @xmath23 converge to @xmath6 strongly , it is clear that their @xmath186-skeletons converge to a @xmath744-tree @xmath8 , where @xmath745 is the group of dyadic rational numbers , and @xmath6 is the @xmath0-completion of @xmath8 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "evidently the natural action of @xmath18 on @xmath8 is still non - trivial , thus the pair @xmath746 gives an example of a finitely generated group @xmath18 which has property ( fa ) , but admits a non - trivial action , without inversions , on a @xmath27-tree @xmath8 . since the @xmath3-rank of @xmath744 is @xmath4 , this example shows that finite presentability is a necessary assumption in the results of gillet and shalen ( * ? ? ?",
