    "a quantum computer comprising many two - level systems  qubits , exhibits coherent superpositions and entanglement . quantum computing , which is based on these features , enables some computational problems to be solved faster than would ever be possible with a classical computer  @xcite , and exponentially speeds up solutions to other problems over the best known classical algorithms  @xcite , is currently attracting enormous interests . among the promising candidates for quantum computing , solid - state implementations such as spin qubits in quantum dots  @xcite and bulk silicon  @xcite , and charge qubits in bulk silicon  @xcite and in superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite , are especially attractive because of stability and expected scalability of solid - state systems ; of these competing technologies , semiconductor double quantum dots ( dqds ) are particularly important because of the combination spin and charge manipulations to take advantage of long memory times associated with spin states and at the same time to enable efficient readout and coherent manipulation of charge states .",
    "our goal is to develop a realizable architecture for semiconductor quantum computation .",
    "the qubit is manifested as a nanowire ( nw ) quantum dot pair such that each having an electron and thus the singlet and one of the triplets of two - electron states correspond to the logical state @xmath0 and the orthogonal state @xmath1 .",
    "the resonator - assisted interaction between dqds and a microwave transmission line resonator ( tlr ) is used to implement a universal set of quantum gates and readout of the qubits .    from two points ,",
    "we show the advantages of our scheme compared to the previous proposals on semiconductor quantum computation .",
    "firstly , for the previous proposals which make use of single or double quantum dots defined by a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )  @xcite , it would be difficult to implement a double - dot in a planar resonator with lateral dots , shaped in a 2deg by surface gates .",
    "the reason being is that it would be difficult to prevent absorption of microwaves in the 2deg unless one can make the electric field non - zero only in the double - dot region , which is not realistic experimentally yet .",
    "our strategy is to use the two - electron states of dqds inside nws instead of 2deg , which is more realistic for implementing quantum computing experimentally .    secondly , there are previous proposals making use of nw dqds  @xcite , in which the spin - orbit interaction is used to couple the spins and resonator .",
    "however the weak coupling between the dqd spins and resonator mode is a challenge in experiments .",
    "our strategy to enhance the interaction is to make use of the coupling between the electric dipole of charge states of dqds and resonator , which is much stronger compared to that in  @xcite .",
    "however the decoherence of charge states is another obstacle . in this work , combining the advantages of spin and charge states and avoiding the weak points of both , we propose a different mechanism , namely via resonator - assisted interaction which leads to a strong coupling between the resonator photons and effective electric dipole of the state @xmath0 and an ancillary state of dqds , while the state @xmath1 is driven by a classical field , and then eventually implements quantum control on the singlet and one of the triplet spin states .",
    "thus we encode the quantum information in spin states and the quantum control is implemented via the charge dipole transition which is driven by a tlr .     and",

    "ii and then we discuss the case where the resonator and qubit are tuned on- and off - resonance which can be used to implement a universal set of gates including single- and two - qubit gates in sec .",
    "iii a - c .",
    "the initialization of qubit states can be implemented by an adiabatic passage shown in sec .",
    "iii d. the readout of qubits can be realized via microwave irradiation of the tlr by probing the transmitted or reflected photons shown in sec .",
    "iii e. in sec .",
    "iii f , the main decoherence processes are dissipation of the tlr , charge - based relaxation and dephasing of the nw dqds occurring during gate operations and transportation of qubits , and spin dephasing limited by hyperfine interactions with nuclei . by numerical analysis",
    "we show all gate operations and measurements can be implemented within the coherent life time of qubits .",

    "<S> we show a method for implementing universal quantum computing using of a singlet and triplets of nanowire double quantum dots coupled to a one - dimensional transmission line resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this method is attractive for both quantum computing and quantum control with inhibition of spontaneous emission , enhanced spin qubit lifetime , strong coupling and quantum nondemolition measurements of spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the performance and stability of all required operations and emphasize that all techniques are feasible with current experimental technology . </S>"
