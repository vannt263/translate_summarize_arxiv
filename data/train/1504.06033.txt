    "the use of images of the earth in different wavelengths from infrared cameras on board of geostationary satellites is a powerful tool for the identification of new potential sites for astronomical observations in optical , infrared and submillimeter wavelengths ( erasmus & sarazin 2002 ; cavazzani et al . 2012 ; cavazzani & zitelli 2013 ) .",
    "sites in remote areas with complex relief and scarse or null meteorological records can be identified by previous computation of the clear sky fraction ( csf ) .",
    "as the cloud covering is a function of the height of the atmosphere , images from satellite are useful due to the detectors on board measure the emissivity of the atmosphere at different layers .",
    "several studies for the determination of the csf are found in the literature .",
    "soden & bretherton ( 1993 ) conducted an analysis of upper tropospheric humidity and clouds using goes observations , finding a correlation between humidity and cloud cover at high altitudes .",
    "erasmus & sarazin ( 2002 ) were among the first to sucesfully use long - term satellite data for csf computations for a wide range of altitudes .",
    "erasmus & van rooyen ( 2006 ) and della valle et al . ( 2010 ) reproduced with high precision the csf records of ground data at la palma with a model based on satellite data .",
    "cavazzani et al .",
    "( 2011,2012 ) found percentages of clear nights at five astronomical observatories around the world using long - term goes data .",
    "hidayat et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used 15 years of goes infrared images in 6.7 and 10.7@xmath2 m bands to compute the percentage of clear sky over a wide region in indonesia .",
    "recently , marn et al . ( 2015 ) computed the csf at high altitude sites by using a new clearance algorithm based on global meteorological models .",
    "csf values were then used for precipitable water vapour estimations at two astronomical sites in the north of chile .    even though most of the methods are based on the comparison of radiances , fluxes or temperatures at each pixel of the satellite image with threshold values previously defined",
    "there is no standard methodology for csf computations .",
    "cavazzani & zitelli ( 2013 ) used monthly thresholds defined as the maximum radiance at clear nights along the month .",
    "thresholds may also be defined by using an atmospheric model @xcite . in this study",
    ", we introduce a novel methodology involving the use of monthly thresholds of temperature at different altitudes from the surface up to the upper troposphere .",
    "our thresholds definitions were based on the altitude of the terrain , long - term records of weather stations and radiosonde data archives .",
    "the thresholds definitions are based on monthly mean records of both , air temperature at the site and vertical temperature profile between 8 and 10 km of altitude which make more precise the predictions for clear covering than those involving atmospheric models for thresholds computations .",
    "our methodology was applied in northern south america over the tropical region covering colombia , western venezuela and northern ecuador .",
    "even though the zone is far from being interesting for infrared and submilimeter astronomy due to the requirement of excellent weather conditions , many universities and institutes from those countries are planning to develope optical observatories .",
    "the countries are located within the intertropical convergence zone ( itcz ) showing complex topography and with a climate governed by a bimodal annual cycle which results of the double passage of the itcz for the region ( poveda et al .",
    "the andes affect the climate by blocking zonalflows , influencing regional wind patterns and precipitation and hosting diverse micro - climates .",
    "the main goal of this study is to seek prospective locations with middle quality csf values over the andes of those countries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the satellite data used in this study .",
    "threshold temperatures calculations are presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the methodology and validation are discussed in sections 5 and 6 while in sections 7 and 8 we present the results and the selected sites .",
    "the geostationary operational enviromental satellites goes 12 and 13 are equiped with instrumentation capable of capture images in several infrared bands . for our purposes",
    "we concentrate our attention on b3 and b4 bands centered at 6.7 and 10.7@xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "images in b4 are strongly affected by emission and absorption of water vapour found at middle altitudes ( @xmath34 km ) whereas layers of the upper trophosphere between 8 and 10 km are sensed by images in the b3 band .",
    "other bands as those centered in 13.3@xmath2 m provide information about fog and very low atmosphere characteristics .",
    "since the data extends for decades these satellites are commonly used for long - term studies .",
    "temporal domaine for this study begins on the 1th of january 2008 and ends on the 31st of december 2012 with a few missing data lower than 7% in the worst cases . goes missing data has different causes : technical troubles in goes-12 ( from december 15th 2008 to january 6th 2009 ) ; when goes-13 replaced goes-12 ( from april 14th to 28th 2010 ) ; and due to anomalies in the operational system ( from september 23th to october 18th 2012 ) .",
    "we assumed the clear sky fraction as null for the days with goes missing data .",
    "goes 12 - 13 images are freely available through an electronic library of noaa in format gvar ( goes variable format ) .",
    "we selected a region of the image to download covering a big part of colombia , the western part of venezuela and the north of ecuador .",
    "for each night we used available observed time at the three different hours 00:15:15 , 06:45:13 and 09:45:14 utc in order to cover the entire night .",
    "gvar is an instrumental radiance given in counts .",
    "we used the library of _ idl _ routines provided by the national climatic data center ( ncdc ) for converting the counts to radiance at each pixel .",
    "usual calibration of the images was done using the scaling bias and gain values available from ncdc website in order to get the radiance in @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "brightness temperatures @xmath5 at the instants @xmath6 of the night are computed from calibrated radiance values by assuming black body emission .",
    "conversion to actual temperatures is done using the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are conversion coefficients dependent on each band ( weinreb et al .",
    "1997 , rossow et al .",
    "1985 ) . reported values available from ncdc website , for goes 12 satellite are @xmath101.01 and @xmath11k for the b3 band and @xmath101.00 and @xmath12k for the b4 band .",
    "the differences between the actual and brightness values increase with decreasing temperature but usually are lower than 4% .",
    "for instance , a brightness temperature of @xmath13k corresponds to temperatures of @xmath14k and @xmath15k for the b3 and b4 bands , respectively . for most of cases",
    "those differences are negligible for the csf computations .",
    "we indicate actual temperatures in b3 and b4 bands as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the spatial resolution of goes images is 4@xmath184 km in both bands and thus a single pixel subtends only a small field of view from the ground compared with the total field of view available for an observer at ground . as the validation of our method involves comparison with log - books of the _ observatorio nacional de llano del hato _ in venezuela ( hereafter , cid ) we degraded the original resolution in order to make more real comparisons .",
    "other authors have used similar or even lower resolutions .",
    "cavazzani and zitelli ( 2012 ) computed goes temperatures for each site over a @xmath19 sub - matrix which corresponds to a linear projection of about 100@xmath18100 km centered on the coordinates observatories at ground .",
    "we used a delanuay interpolation of actual temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath17 on a grid of 51@xmath20 pixels obtaining a resolution of 28@xmath1818 km which we consider wide enough for validation with ground data .",
    "detection of mid - altitude clouds at a height of 4000 meters above a pixel location of the image in b4 band and at a fixed instant during the night requires the previous evaluation of a threshold or reference temperature . in this study",
    "we compute monthly thresholds of temperature based on long - term records of weather stations located inside the region covered by the goes b4 and b3 images .",
    "+ we used long - term records of meteorological data obtained from the _ instituto de hidrologa , meteorologa y estudios ambientales _ , hereafter ideam .",
    "the ideam data archive comprise periods from 7 to 40 years of monthly mean values of temperature and precipitation for a set of weather stations in colombia .",
    "the complete archive contains 400 records at altitudes between 400 and 4700 meters above sea level covering 25% of the country .",
    "the archive presents a high number of gaps , especially those of temperature .",
    "we considered only long - term records of temperature with a maximum of one monthly absence obtaining the reduced number of 63 weather stations irregularly distributed in a region comprising latitudes between 3@xmath1 and 7@xmath1 north , and longitudes from -76@xmath1 up to -72@xmath1 west .",
    "we will refer to this region as the control region defined by the spatial distribution of the ideam long - term historical records .",
    "the longest records of these selected stations have more than 40 yr as is shown in the right panel of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "locations are widely distributed in different altitudes with a high number of them close around bogot ( bog ) ( @xmath21=2600 meters ) as shown in the left panel of the same figure .",
    "+ the average of monthly mean records at each station for periods spanning at least 7 years is expected to be normally distributed around a central value @xmath22 being very likely that the monthly mean values are within @xmath23 of the distribution , where @xmath24 is the standard deviation .",
    "the coldest temperature at each station may be then defined as @xmath25 .",
    "however , an additional correction term must be applied since the measurements do not represent values during the night .",
    "we recall that the ideam archive consists only of mean temperatures thus we must correct them for nightime observations . the monthly threshold temperature at each station may therefore computed as : @xmath26 \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the trend of the minima records of temperature given by short - term records of weather stations indicated with a solid line in figure [ f2 ] and represents the correction for night - time observations .",
    "we note that these thresholds correlate very well with the altitude of the station as illustrated in the same figure suggesting that monthly threshold temperatures may be completely determined from the altitude of the stations . from linear fits for each month",
    "we established monthly relationships between threshold and altitude of the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants for each month with values indicated in table [ t1 ] .",
    "slight differences along the year are observed for these two parameters with slope or lapse rates variations of the order of @xmath31 @xmath1c and negligible variations in the intercepts .",
    "+      thresholds in the control region at locations where no weather stations are available require interpolation of the altitudes .",
    "we used the geostatistical method called kriging , which is a spatial interpolation method that in its simplest form allows to compute altitudes at locations with no data , based on the spatial autocorrelation .",
    "this means that two close stations have similar values of altitude whilst two stations farther apart do not . briefly ,",
    "the height at the location @xmath32 refered as @xmath33 is given by a weighted combination of the ideam all records of altitude :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the vector of kriging weights @xmath36 and @xmath21 is the vector of available samples of altitudes .",
    "our sample is defined by the altitudes of all available records of weather stations .",
    "the system of equations ( [ dos ] ) is equivalent to the matrix form @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the matrix of covariances between all sampled values and @xmath39 the vector of covariances between sampled points and the point in which the value is assessed .",
    "the vector of covariance is obtained from the semivariogram @xmath40 defined as :    @xmath41 \\label{tres}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 represents the unit distance or lag from which semivariance is determined .",
    "the two semivariograms indicated in figure [ f3 ] were computed for lags up to 200 km along two mutual perpendicular directions .",
    "both semivariograms present similar spatial variances and are well described by a spherical model ( dashed line ) with a nugget of @xmath43 , sill of @xmath44 and range of @xmath45 .",
    "the spherical model was found as the most suitable for modeling the covariances ( [ tres ] ) and for solving the weights in the system of equations ( [ dos ] ) by using gsl - gnu numerical libraries for matrix inversion .",
    "a comparison of the interpolated heights with real altitudes from all - term ideam weather stations is shown in the figure [ f4 ] .",
    "cross validation of the kriging interpolator was done by hiding each ideam data point during the computation of the weights and then comparing the prediction with the real value .",
    "differences with an ideal kriging interpolation ( solid line ) are within 3@xmath46 which we consider enough good for our purposes .    based on kriging results for altitude interpolation in the control region , we computed the monthly thresholds using the values appearing in the table [ t1 ] .",
    "results are very similar for all the months with small differences due to the bimodal annual cycle .",
    "threshold temperatures for january with resolution of 28@xmath1818 km are shown in the panel b ) of figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the coldest region ( 0 - 2)@xmath1c corresponds to the _ nevado del huila _ the highest snow peak in the central branch of the andes . thresholds between ( 2 - 7)@xmath1c are observed in the eastern andes comprising _ villa de leyva _ ( vdl ) , _ pisba _ ( pis ) and _ macaravita _ ( mac ) .",
    "warm regions with thresholds above 20@xmath1c characterize the valley of _ magdalena _ river between the central and eastern branches of the andes and the southestern regions on zero altitude zones .    for comparison purposes ,",
    "we show in panel a ) the thresholds obtained using delaunay triangulation of the 63 ideam long - term monthly records .",
    "we note that the spatial domaine is constrained in this case and defined by the triangulation of the 63 irregularly distributed long - term ideam weather stations .",
    "differences between both interpolations are significant mostly in regions surrounded by strong topographic gradients in which a better estimation of the threshold temperatures using kriging is expected .",
    "this is particularly noticed in the poor ideam sampled region centered on pis where a maximum difference of @xmath47c is observed .",
    "other regions with low number of weather stations are the south of _ bucaramanga _ ( buc ) and the south - east of _ medelln _ ( med ) . on these regions",
    "the combination of the lack of weather stations and strong gradients in altitude make the delanuay interpolation unrealistic . mean differences of @xmath48c over the eastern andes are atribuited mainly to strong gradients as the region is well sampled by the ideam data archive .",
    "thresholds obtained from altitude are more precise than those obtained by interpolation of weather station records and are used as a reference for cloud detection in the b4 band .",
    "uncertainties in the threshold temperature determination are computed using the sigma error of the kriging interpolation .",
    "the largest errors up to 6@xmath1c are observed over the sea level locations and into the valleys while errors over the andes are always below 1.5@xmath1c as shown in panel c ) of figure [ f4 ] .",
    "for the control region the thresholds are computed with an uncertainty of @xmath49c .    with the aim of computing monthly threshold temperatures over a wider region including the _ observatorio nacional de llano del hato _ where log - books of cloud cover fraction are available",
    ", we apply monthly threshold - altitude relations over what we denoted as extended region covering latitudes between 0 and 13n and longitudes between 70 and 78w .",
    "a set of @xmath50 altitudes over this region were obtained from _ google - maps _ and interpolated using the methodology discussed above .",
    "monthly threshold temperatures between @xmath51 and @xmath52c are observed across caribbean coastal regions and in the valleys of the rivers magdalena and cauca in panels of figure [ f5 ] . in the proximity to the andes ,",
    "thresholds get colder specially in the highest mountains indicated with purple in the figure such as the four highests locations over the colombian and venezuelan andes highlands with threshold temperatures below @xmath53c .",
    "uncertainties in threshold temperatures over the extended region are assumed to be equal to those obtained in the control region .",
    "interpolated threshold temperatures covering the surface of the extended region are then used in our algorithm for cloud detection in the b4 band .",
    "for a fixed instant , if the temperature obtained from the goes image at 10.7 @xmath2 m is colder than @xmath54 then the presence of a cloud above the location is inferred .",
    "clouds along the upper troposphere are detected following a similar schema , defining first a threshold temperature for high altitudes where the weighting functions of b3 shows the maximum value .",
    "we denote the altitude of the atmosphere measured from the ground with @xmath55 , different to the altitude of a weather station @xmath21 .",
    "we recall that the weighting functions depending on both , the wavelength and @xmath55 , determine the layer from which the emitted radiation originates . for the b3 band ,",
    "the median height values of the weighting functions are in the interval @xmath56 km of altitude above the ground with a maximum at 9 km ( cavazzani et al.2011 ) .",
    "threshold temperatures at upper troposphere may be obtained using different approaches .",
    "hydayat et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered the reference atmospheric model of kneizys et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which provides a vertical tropospheric profile of temperature for latitudes within @xmath57 and adopted a threshold equal to @xmath58c at the observatory location based on a @xmath59 analysis with data of sky visual inspection .",
    "our approach is based on the use of three thresholds each one at heights of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 km obtained from radiosonde upper - air measurements .",
    "we make a strong emphasis on the reliability of the temperature at upper troposphere .",
    "particularly , we are interested in finding trustworthy threshold values between 8 and 10 km .",
    "data were obtained twice a day from the freely available database of the university of wyoming which provides information of temperature , humidity , pressure and mixing ratio as a function of the altitude for two stations located inside the extended region , _",

    "upper - air temperatures of both stations exhibit similar patterns as a function of the altitude .",
    "around 60 radiosonde records were used per month adding data from both stations .",
    "altitude resolution is variable with typical values ranging from 200 up to 600 m.    we compute monthly mean temperatures by considering measurements made twice daily ( 00 and 12 utc ) during the years 2008 - 12 at each @xmath55 using linear interpolation along a uniform vertical grid of 21 points between @xmath60 and @xmath62 km . in order to follow the same approach than the one used for ground thresholds , we define the threshold temperature at the altitude @xmath55 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the monthly mean",
    "value and @xmath65 is the standard deviation .",
    "monthly thresholds as a function of the altitude are displayed in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "monthly standard deviations change with altitude and time showing yearly variations up to @xmath49c in the worst of cases . in the tropics ,",
    "the temperature anomalies at high altitudes is enhanced by the presence of moderate size clouds usually associated with shallow convection responsible for anomalies up to @xmath66c at altitudes from 5 up to 14 km ( folkins 2008 ) .",
    "this tropospheric warming has been largely observed and we suggest that is the main source of the sigma variations .    the further assumption that these thresholds describe the upper troposphere of the whole extended region in many aspects is a strong hypothesis , however the area of study is affected by atmospheric phenomena including the westerly low level _",
    "choc _ jet coming from the pacific coasts of colombia ( poveda & mesa 2000 ) and the caribbean trade winds which leads to similar daily patterns of high altitude clouds .",
    "middle and right panels in figure [ f7 ] show a typical evolution during the night of 8th of april 2009 .",
    "we see two images in b3 taken at the beginning and at the end of the night .",
    "high altitude clouds shown in green color in the left panel coming from the pacific ocean are blocked by the andes system leaving clear zones in the andes of venezuela and over the amazon zones .",
    "we note that the fact of extrapolating thresholds over all the extended region , the possible changes in the instrumentation and the differences between night and daytime observations may affect the observed temperatures and therefore introduce considerable noise in the computed thresholds . however , the monthly thresholds obtained with these two stations are in agreement with the predictions of the tropical atmospheric model of kneizys ( 1996 ) indicated with the solid line in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "we implemented an algorithm for percentage of clear sky calculation during the night through a comparison pixel to pixel of goes 12/13 interpolated temperatures with monthly threshold values obtained from long - term records of weather stations and radiosonde databases .",
    "we constructed four monthly threshold images , one for band b4 labeled as @xmath54 and three for b3 labeled as @xmath67 each one at heights @xmath68 and @xmath62 km .",
    "daily comparisons were done in both bands at 00:15:15 , 06:45:13 and 09:45:14 utc with similar approach to those described in hidayat et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and erasmus & sarazin ( 2002 ) .",
    "first we used daily radiances in the b4 band to compute brightness and actual temperatures .",
    "if the satellite derived temperature is colder than the monthly threshold at b4 the presence of middle high clouds above the pixel image at the instant @xmath69 is inferred :    @xmath70    where @xmath54 is a monthly constant depending only on the altitude of the terrain .",
    "if a pixel is classified as covered in b4 it will be also covered in the b3 band . on the contrary , if the pixel is clear in b4 we still have to verify the presence of high altitude cirrus clouds by doing a further and similar analysis using the b3 band .",
    "the pixel is classified as clear or covered in b3 at the altitude @xmath55 in the following way :    @xmath71    where @xmath64 denotes the monthly mean temperature of the upper troposphere at height @xmath55 and @xmath72 the standard deviation at that height .",
    "we compute three values of clear sky fraction at the instant @xmath69 and at each altitude @xmath55 using inequalities ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) by counting the number of clears or covered pixels .",
    "the total clear sky fraction at altitude @xmath55 is then obtained from the average of the three instants @xmath69 along the night .",
    "one value of csf is computed in this way at each altitude .",
    "the nights in the extended region are classified as spectroscopic or photometric at each altitude @xmath55 based on the values of total clear sky fraction .",
    "we define the quality of the night , at the height @xmath55 , as spectroscopic if the total clear sky fraction is larger than @xmath73 . as we computed the total csf with three values , spectroscopic nights are those with @xmath74 of the night free of clouds at least .",
    "sites that fulfill this requirement are more suitable for spectroscopic observations than for photometric ones as long as spectra can be acquired quickly in comparison with photometeric data .",
    "we note that this definition is based only on the amount of clear sky and does not involve any sky quality indicator .",
    "spectroscopic night simulations ( hereafter , sns ) provide monthly averages of clear sky fraction at three different altitudes for each pixel of the image satisfying the condition that csf is larger than 33% .",
    "nights with photometric quality on the other hand , are those with total sky fraction larger than 67% corresponding to @xmath75 of clear sky during the night at least . if this condition is fulfilled in a particular site , we argue than at the altitude @xmath55 will be possible to conduct photometric observations .",
    "photometric night simulations ( hereafter , pns ) provide monthly maps of clear sky fraction at three different altitudes for each pixel of the image with the condition that csf is larger than 67% .",
    "based on total csf values obtained with sns and pns outputs , monthly averages at altitude @xmath55 were computed .",
    "cloud cover along the upper - troposphere is sensitive to the altitude , being larger at low altitudes mostly at @xmath76 km , indicating that high cirrus does not affect considerably the net cloud fraction .",
    "we used the monthly csf averages at @xmath76 , @xmath61 and @xmath770 km to compute a weigthed mean for the three altitudes at each instant during the night .",
    "weights were computed through a comparison of the amount of clear sky fraction for photometric nights coming from our model with those obtained from daily number of observing hours reported by log - books of cid or site 2 in venezuela .",
    "site 2 is placed at 3600 meters height and enclosed by higher mountains as _ pico bolvar _ ( 4978 m ) at less than 40 km away .",
    "as the resolution is 28 km in longitude and 18 km in latitude , the threshold temperature at site 2 is highly affected by the altitude of the closest higher mountains giving colder thresholds than expected .",
    "using pns instead of sns makes more precise validation because pns output is closer to the condition of total clear night .",
    "figure [ f8 ] corresponds to the clear hours above the reference site 2 or cid as reported in the log - book . despite the bias present in the log - books and the missing data for the years 2009 - 10 ,",
    "due mainly to bad weather , we did not find considerable differences between observed and expected monthly clear sky fraction values when different weights were used .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this study , we consider sufficient to use equal weights for the three altitudes .    the validation of our code is limited due to factors such as the lack of completeness of daily log - books , tecnhical issues , high humidity , strong winds and uncertainties of our model .",
    "we used all the information available in the log books as the general description of the night done by the astronomer to compute the amount of daily clear sky fraction for each month of the years 2008 - 12 at site 2 .",
    "comparison with our monthly results using pns is displayed in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "the solid line represents no differences between predicted and measured monthly clear sky fraction values .",
    "there is a large spread during the considered years , especially for clear sky fraction values between 20 - 60% , but in general terms they are in reasonable agreement .",
    "monthly percentages of clear sky for the years 2008 - 12 over the extended region were obtained using the method described above .",
    "the main common feature is that monthly averages display maxima at the same locations along the five years .",
    "maximum monthly percentages of clear sky are observed during two periods in the years 2008 - 12 , one from december to february and another from june to july according with the bimodal annual cycle of precipitation ( poveda et al .",
    "the year 2012 stands out as the best year displaying the highest percentages during both periods .",
    "we take the year 2012 as representative of the monthly distributions of clear sky . as illustrated in figure [ f10 ] our monthly averages of csf for sns nights exhibit differences along the year with the highest csf values always located over a wide region in the central venezuelan andes with a maximum csf@xmath7880% at site 1 during both periods . for site 2 or cid corresponding to _",
    "observatorio nacional de llano del hato _ we get a csf mean value of 58.5% , lower in comparison with site 1 during both periods .    we have found two regions in colombia with similar night qualities to those observed at site 2 . the northern part of the _ sierra nevada de santamarta _ close to _ nabusimake _ ( nab ) and the central _ serrana del perij _ toward the east of _ codazzi _ ( cod ) .",
    "percentages at these two regions are in the range of 80 - 90% during the first period , 50 - 70% during the second and below 30% from march to may and between august and october .",
    "sites over this region contain the best places in colombia found in this study .",
    "somewhat low quality places are found over the north - eastern andes of colombia , over mountain systems along buc , mac and pis with clear sky fraction between 30 - 50% during both periods of 2012 .",
    "southern andes regions in the _ nudo de los pastos _ , especially those in northern ecuador display csf values below 30% from november to may and @xmath370% from june to october .",
    "very low percentages of clear sky fraction below 20% characterize central andes of colombia over the regions comprising _ popayn _ ( pop ) and bog with the exception of the region centered at the high site _ nevado del huila _",
    "( 75@xmath15512``w , 2@xmath15136''n ) at 3700 meters with a mean of 35% between december - february and june - july and 33% for the other months .",
    "regarding monthly averages of csf for pns nights , the same regions were found but with low percentages in comparison as shown in figure [ f11 ] .",
    "the absence of spectroscopic nights in central colombia from may to october confirms that november - february and june - july are marked by the largest csf percentages while march - may and august - november are characterized by lower csf values .",
    "we also observe such behaviour for other years .",
    "the existence of this bimodal behaviour with maxima during the dry season and minima during the rainy season is atributed , as we metioned already , to the double passage of the intertropical convergence zone for the extended region .",
    "therefore we conducted yearly sns and pns simulations , bringing together the months december , january , february , june , july and august into one group that we call _ dry season _ and march , april , may , september , october and november into another group denoted as _",
    "rainy season_.    sns percentages for both seasons show maxima at the same locations than those observed for the year 2012 with seasonal differences of @xmath320% with the exception of low latitude locations close to the equator where slightly smaller differences are observed .",
    "percentages for pns simulations result 10% lower in comparison to sns nights but with identical csf distribution over the extended region .",
    "annual clear sky fraction averages obtained from our sns simulations during rainy seasons for the years 2009 and 2012 are larger than for the other years .",
    "it seems to correlate with the changes in the oceanic nio index ( oni ) reported by the climate prediction center noaa .",
    "changes from positive to negative anomalies in april 2010 associated to a _ la nia _ event increase the number and intensity of tropical storms in central colombian andes thus decreasing the clear sky percentages .",
    "the _ nudo de los pastos _ and the _ sierra nevada de santamarta _ are not considerably affected by this _ el nio southern oscillation _ ( enso ) .",
    "for selection purposes we give preference to the simulations for spectroscopic nights during the dry seasons . we have selected twelve sites based on five year averages during the dry seasons that can be suitable for astronomical observations by selecting locations with csf@xmath7830% .",
    "factors such as accesibility , security , service , local humidity , atomospheric _ seeing _ were not considered and we need additional studies to confirm these locations as potential for astronomical sites .",
    "these twelve selected sites are distributed mostly along the following four zones : the central andes of venezuela comprising the states of _ mrida _ and _ trujillo _ , the north east of the _ sierra nevada de santamarta _ around sites nab and cod , the north eastern andes of colombia in the proximity of _ el espino _ ( esp ) and a wide region on the southern andes in _ nudo de los pastos _ containing two locations in ecuador .",
    "we show in figure [ f16 ] the contours of clear sky fraction for these selected zones during the dry season with a spatial pixel resolution of 28@xmath1818 km .",
    "even though the selection criteria involves only spectroscopic nights during the dry seasons , we give a total number of clear nights per year at selected sites by adding the csf five year averages for each season and then multiplying by a factor of 1.827 .",
    "tables [ tbl-2 ] and [ tbl-3 ] contain properties of the selected sites indicating the identifier , the nearest populated location , geographic coordinates of the site , altitude , yearly five year averages for the dry and rainy seasons , five year average of clear sky fraction , standard deviation and the total number of clear nights per year .",

    "monthly linear correlations between thresholds and altitude were found and extrapolated to an extended region including _ observatorio nacional de llano del hato_. threshold monthly temperatures at 8 , 9 and 10 km along the upper atmosphere were also computed based on daily radiosonde data of two stations located at sea level and at the central andes .",
    "the method differs from other cloud fraction algorithms that uses long - term records of temperature to obtain the csf .",
    "our approach gives more precise csf values as long as we have used reliable reference temperatures at the surface and at the high troposphere .",

    "<S> in this study we describe an innovative method to determine potential sites for optical and infrared astronomical observations in the andes region of northern south america . </S>",
    "<S> the method computes the clear sky fraction ( csf ) from geostationary observational environmental satellite ( goes ) data for the years 2008 - 12 through a comparison with temperatures obtained from long - term records of weather stations and atmospheric temperature profiles from radiosonde . </S>",
    "<S> criteria for sky clearance were established for two infrared goes channels in order to determine potential sites in the andes region of northern south - america . </S>",
    "<S> the method was validated using the reported observed hours at _ observatorio nacional de llano del hato _ in venezuela . </S>",
    "<S> separate csf percentages were computed for dry and rainy seasons for both , photometric and spectroscopic night qualities . </S>",
    "<S> twelve sites with five year averages of csf for spectroscopic nights larger than 30% during the dry seasons were found to be suitable for astronomical observations . </S>",
    "<S> the best site with ( 220@xmath042 ) spectroscopic clear nights per year is located in the andes of venezuela ( 70@xmath12848``w , 9@xmath1560''n ) at an altitude of 3480 meters . </S>",
    "<S> lower quality regions were found in _ </S>",
    "<S> sierra nevada de santamarta _ and _ serrana del perij _ with ( 126@xmath034 ) and ( 111@xmath027 ) clear nights per year , respectively . sites over the andes are identified in _ </S>",
    "<S> norte de santander _ with ( 107@xmath023 ) and in the north - east part of _ boyac _ with a mean of ( 94@xmath013 ) clear nights per year . </S>",
    "<S> two sites at low latitude located in ecuador with more than 100 clear nights per year and with similar seasonal csf percentages were also identified . </S>",
    "<S> five year evolution suggest a possible correlation between the lowest percentages observed during the rainy seasons of 2010 and 2011 with positive values of the southern oscillation index . </S>"
