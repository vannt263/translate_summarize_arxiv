    "we assume that the corresponding decay - width difference is zero . here , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complex constants that relate the -meson flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates , and @xmath21 is the ratio of amplitudes of the decay without mixing of a or to the final state under study .",
    "the average mistag probability describes the effect of incorrect tags , and @xmath22 is the difference between the mistag probabilities for and  mesons . the sine term in eq .  [ eq : timedist ] results from the interference between direct decay and decay after @xmath4 oscillation .",
    "a non - zero cosine term arises from the interference between decay amplitudes with different weak and strong phases ( direct violation @xmath23 ) or from violation in @xmath4 mixing ( @xmath24 ) .    in the sm ,  violation in mixing",
