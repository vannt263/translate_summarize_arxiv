    "relaxation to the equilibrium state of a system at a critical point becomes extremely slow and shows a universal behavior .",
    "recently , such dynamic critical phenomena have been receiving much interests in various fields of physics from condensed matter physics to cosmology @xcite .",
    "the dynamic critical phenomena have successfully been described by effective theories @xcite , and have been classified into several subclasses from the static universal classes according to the symmetries of the order parameters and whether there are couplings to other conserved quantities or not @xcite . in these effective theories",
    "diffusive motions are assumed for the order parameters at the tree level and then nonlinear interactions among the order parameters are included together with the interactions of the order parameters and the conserved quantities . in principle",
    "both the effective and microscopic theories should describe critical phenomena equally well , if one can take into account contributions relevant to dynamic critical phenomena in each theory .",
    "however , it is known , for instance , that the @xmath2 expansion in the standard method of the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) effective action leads to different results for the dynamic critical exponent in the effective and microscopic theories @xcite .",
    "thus , microscopic understandings of dynamic critical phenomena , in particular the generation of the diffusive mode , have not been achieved and still remain a challenge @xcite .",
    "the method of the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action @xcite has recently attracted much attention @xcite . in this method ,",
    "self - energy corrections for the two - point function are first summed up and then the expansion is carried out in terms of the _ full _ two - point function .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard method of the 1pi effective action , where the expansion is in terms of the _ free _ two - point function .",
    "the method of the 2pi effective action provides us with a way of systematic resummation of the perturbative expansion .",
    "therefore , as was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is expected to take into account the secular effects of collisions in the microscopic theory which are considered to be responsible for the diffusive behavior of the two - point function at low energies and momenta .    according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis @xcite",
    ", the inverse of the retarded two - point function at the critical point , @xmath8 , has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath0 ) is the static ( dynamic ) critical exponent and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the energy ( momentum ) .",
    "this relation implies that the mode energy scales with the momentum as @xmath13 at the critical point .    for low @xmath11 ( @xmath14 )",
    ", @xmath8 is analytic in @xmath11 ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 which constrains the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function , @xmath16 , to be @xmath17 therefore , while the static critical exponent , @xmath10 , can be read off from @xmath18 , the dynamic critical exponent , @xmath0 , can be obtained from either @xmath19 or @xmath20 together with the knowledge of @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we would like to clarify the relation between two descriptions of the dynamic critical phenomena , i.e.  in terms of the effective theory and in terms of the microscopic theory , paying special attention to the diffusive mode .",
    "thereby , we would like to resolve the confusions sometimes seen in the literature .",
    "we employ a simple time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model @xcite or model a in the classification of ref .",
    "@xcite for the effective theory and the imaginary - time formalism of the field theory at finite temperature @xcite for the microscopic theory .",
    "taking an @xmath1 scalar model as an example and carrying out the @xmath2 expansion up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the 1pi and 2pi effective actions , we compare the low - energy and low - momentum behavior of the response function in the effective theory and of the retarded green s function in the microscopic theory .",
    "we show that two descriptions are equivalent at the nlo of the 2pi @xmath2 expansion , i.e.  the self - consistent equation for the two - point function , the kadanoff - baym equation , is exactly the same in the effective and microscopic theories , while two descriptions are quite different at the nlo of the 1pi @xmath2 expansion .",
    "secondly , we would like to explore the possibility of improving the previous calculation @xcite of the dynamic critical exponent at the nlo of the @xmath2 expansion in model a. by incorporating the static 2pi correlations into the two - point function , we identify the infrared logarithmic term with respect to energy or momentum , from which we determine the critical exponent , @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in sec .  2 we explain the minimal formalism of the effective and microscopic theories .",
    "is devoted to the critical exponents with the 1pi effective action .",
    "after we review the calculation of the static critical exponent , the dynamic critical exponent in the effective theory and also in the nonrelativistic field theory for comparison , we discuss the dynamic critical exponent in the relativistic field theory",
    ". then we move on to the critical exponents with the 2pi effective action in sec .",
    "4 . again , after reviewing the calculation of the static critical exponent , we discuss the dynamic critical exponent . in sec .  5",
    "we present the results of our calculation of the dynamic critical exponent , where we incorporate the static 2pi correlations .",
    "we summarize the paper and provide some discussions in sec .",
    "as an example we consider a system in a @xmath21-dimensional space , which is in the symmetric ( disordered ) phase of the @xmath1 symmetry with a scalar order parameter . in the present paper ,",
    "some quantities , such as two - point function or self - energy , appear both in the effective and microscopic theories .",
    "we express quantities with the superscript @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) in the effective ( microscopic ) theory , but without superscript @xmath24 omit the superscripts in the relation which holds both in the effective and microscopic theories .    in the tdgl theory , the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian , @xmath25 ,",
