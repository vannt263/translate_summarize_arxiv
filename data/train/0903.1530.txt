    "negatively refracting materials have been subjected to intense interest since the first experimental demonstration of a negatively refracting isotropic dielectric  magnetic material at the turn of this century mith_prl , shelby . the enhanced scope for negative refraction in anisotropic materials u , kark , and in materials which exhibit either isotropic",
    "lvv86,tgm_motl , monzon or anisotropic ml_pre04 magnetoelectric coupling , has been widely reported upon .",
    "indeed , bianisotropy may be responsible for unexplained features in certain materials which were taken to be isotropic dielectric ",
    "magnetic materials marques .",
    "we confine ourselves here to linear passive materials .",
    "the characterization of negative refraction in anisotropic and bianisotropic materials should be expected to be much more complicated than in isotropic dielectric  magnetic materials , as the effects of directionality , magnetoelectric coupling , and two refraction wavevectors need to be considered ml_pio .",
    "however , it is often overlooked that even in an isotropic dielectric material the effects of directionality can be important if _ nonuniform _ plane waves are considered .",
    "negative phase velocity ( npv )    which means that the phase velocity of a plane wave casts a negative projection onto the time  averaged poynting vector",
    "  is commonly taken as convenient indication of the propensity for negative refraction jp , depine .",
    "for uniform plane waves in isotropic dielectric ",
    "magnetic materials , the phase velocity and time  averaged poynting vector are either parallel or antiparallel . accordingly , as regards uniform planewave propagation , _ negative refraction _ and _ npv _ are held to be effectively synonymous terms for these materials .",
    "but for nonuniform plane waves , the time  averaged poynting vector and the phase velocity vector are not necessarily parallel or antiparallel , even in isotropic dielectric materials c_chen .",
    "the introduction of anisotropy or bianisotropy further complicates the issue , with the phase velocity and time  averaged poynting vector being generally neither parallel nor antiparallel , for both uniform and nonuniform plane waves .",
    "thus , npv should not be generally assumed to be a definite signature of the capability to exhibit negative refraction .",
    "for many practical applications , the direction of energy flow , as delineated by the time  averaged poynting vector , and its deflection at the planar boundary between two different mediums may be more significant than the deflection of the wavevector .",
    "it is quite possible for the real part of a refraction wavevector and its associated time  averaged poynting",
    "vector to be oriented on opposite sides of the normal to a planar interface .",
    "this counterposition of the real part of the refraction wavevector and the time  averaged poynting vector has been theoretically demonstrated as taking place in certain anisotropic belov_motl , zfm , optik_counterposition and bianisotropic motl_counterposition materials .",
    "furthermore , counterposition can also arise for nonuniform planewave propagation in certain isotropic dielectric materials , as we describe later in this paper .",
    "very recently there have been several reports of bianisotropic materials which may possess structural chirality and exhibit a ",
    "negative index \" plum , zhang , wegener_ol , wegener_nature , including a commentary on this topic wl .",
    "the  negative index \" relates to the real part of a wavenumber ( relative to that in vacuum ) , typically corresponding to propagation in one direction only , for one polarization state only .",
    "however , the planewave responses of bianisotropic materials is not at all adequately represented that simply : different directions of propagation , different polarization states , and the relationship to the time  averaged poynting vector need to be considered too .",
    "in contrast , we note that there are some studies in which bianisotropic aspects are taken into account better varadan , tretyakov2007,ozbay . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we highlight the complications that can arise in the planewave response of such a bianisotropic material ; furthermore , we demonstrate that some of these complications can actually be exhibited by relatively simple materials , such as an isotropic dielectric material . in so doing",
    ", we report on important distinctions between negative refraction , npv , and counterposition which have not been been appreciated hitherto .",
    "let us consider the lorentz  reciprocal krowne bianisotropic material described by the constitutive relations @xmath0 wherein @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the permittivity and permeability of vacuum , respectively , and @xmath4 .",
    "these particular constitutive relations were chosen because they have been used to describe a material assembled from layers of split  ring resonators hen .",
    "this general configuration is a popular one within the negative refraction community wegener_nature , wegener_ol , ozbay , but it origins predate the current surge of interest in negative refraction ngheta_motl .",
