    "cryptography is created to satisfy the people s desire of transmitting secret messages . with the development of the quantum computation , especially the proposal of shor s algorithm@xcite , the base of the most important classic cryptographic scheme was shocked .",
    "but at the same time , the principles of quantum mechanics have also shed new light on the field of cryptography as these fundamental laws guarantee the secrecy of quantum cryptosystems .",
    "any intervention of an eavesdropper , eve , must leave some trace which can be detected by the legal users of the communication channel .",
    "all kinds of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes , such as bb84 protocol@xcite , b92 protocol@xcite , and the epr scheme@xcite have been proposed .",
    "recently , quantum cryptography with @xmath2-state systems was also introduced@xcite",
    ". experimental research on qkd is also progressing fast , for instance , the optical - fiber experiment of bb84 and b92 protocols have been realized up to 48 km@xcite , and qkd in free space for b92 scheme has been achieved over 1 km distance@xcite .    in paper@xcite , lior and",
    "lev presented a quantum cryptography based on orthogonal states firstly .",
    "then there is quantum cryptographic scheme involving truly two orthogonal states @xcite .",
    "the basic technic is to split the transfer of one - bit information into two steps , ensuring that only a fraction of the bit information is transmitted at a time .",
    "then the non - cloning theorem of orthogonal states@xcite guarantee its security .",
    "based on the impossibility of cloning nonorthogonal mixed states , the no - cloning theorem of orthogonal states says that the two ( or more ) orthogonal states @xmath3 of the system composed of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can not be cloned if the reduced density matrices of the subsystem which is available first ( say @xmath4 ) @xmath6 $ ] are nonorthogonal and nonidentical , and if the reduced density matrices of the second subsystem are nonorthogonal .",
    "it is a very surprising result since it means that entanglement is not vital for preventing cloning of orthogonal states . in the case of a composite system made of two subsystems , if the subsystem are only available one after the other , then there are various cases that orthogonal states can not be cloned",
    ".    for the multi - state systems , bennett _ et al . _",
    "have shown that there are orthogonal product pure states in the @xmath7 hilbert space and proved that these states may have some degree of nonlocality without entanglement@xcite .",
    "there was also experimental demonstration of three mutually orthogonal polarization states@xcite , where biphotons are used as multi - state systems .",
    "we propose the general conditions for the orthogonal product states of the multi - state composite systems to be used in qkd , then present a qkd scheme with the orthogonal product states of @xmath7 system which has several distinct features , such as high efficiency and great capacity .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath8-state systems , and eavesdropping is analyzed where a peculiar limitation , @xmath9 for the success probability of an efficient eavesdropping strategy is found as _  _ @xmath8 _",
    "_ becomes large enough .",
    "in the present qkd scheme with orthogonal product states in the @xmath1 hilbert space , the transmission processing is same as the qkd scheme with common orthogonal states@xcite .",
    "the information is encoded in the holistic state of the two particles , and these two particles are sent separately to ensure that any eavesdropper can not hold both particles at the same time . since only orthogonal product state are employed , operations on one subsystem have no effect to the other . there are some basic conditions for any set of orthogonal product states in the @xmath8-state composite systems to be used in the present qkd scheme : for any density matrix of any subsystem , @xmath10 there must be at least one @xmath11 which is both nonidentical and nonorthogonal to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 represents subsystem @xmath4 or @xmath5 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent different states of the set . ) then from the point of any subsystem@xcite , the standard non - cloning theorem @xcite is satisfied , this guarantees the security of the protocol .",
    "what s more , we can transmit @xmath16 bits information , double the value of existing qkd protocol with usual orthogonal states@xcite .",
    "it is evident that this is the maximal information that can be transmitted by the @xmath1 system .    for @xmath17 system , there is obviously no such orthogonal product states that satisfy the orthogonal states cryptography conditions .",
    "the reason is that if @xmath18 are nonidentical and nonorthogonal to @xmath19 , then @xmath20 can not be orthogonal to @xmath21    next , we consider the @xmath7 system .",
    "a general set of orthogonal product states in this hilbert space is as following @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 are complex number and @xmath31    this set of states has been proved to have some degree of nonlocality without entanglement , when @xmath32@xcite .",
    "for the general case , no satisfying proof for the existing of the nonlocality has been found yet .",
    "but if they satisfy the conditions mentioned above , they can still be used in this qkd scheme .",
    "the process of this qkd scheme is as follows :",
    "alice prepares two particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 randomly in one of the nine orthogonal product states shown above and sends particle @xmath4 to bob , when bob receives it , he informs alice through open classical channel .",
    "then alice sends out particle @xmath5 .",
    "when particle @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both in the hand of bob , he makes a collective orthogonal measurement under the basis of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) to determine which state the two - particle system has been prepared . after a sequence of this procedure , they can share a random bit string , which is the raw keys .",
    "2 . in order to find possible eavesdropping , alice and",
    "bob randomly compare some bits to verify whether the correlations have been destroyed .",
    "if it is true with as high probability as they require , it can be believed that there is no eavesdropper and all of the rest results can be used as cryptographic keys .",
    "otherwise , all the keys are discarded and they must be redistributed .",
    "what is vital to this scheme is that alice sends the second particle only when the first one reaches bob to eliminate the possibility of any eavesdropper to possess the two particles at the same time .",
    "this protocol has some distinct features .",
    "as all raw keys except a small portion chosen for checking eavesdroppers is usable , it is very efficient ( nearly @xmath33 ) , and it has large capacity since @xmath34 bits information is transmitted by a @xmath7 system .",
    "we first consider one efficient eavesdropping strategy . in this strategy , eve measures the first particle from alice and sends it to bob .",
    "she measures the second particle corresponding to the measurement result of the first one and sends it to bob .",
    "it has been found that with this strategy , eve has the success eavesdropping probability as high as @xmath35 for qkd with orthogonal states in the @xmath17 hilbert space@xcite .",
    "the eavesdropping is as following , eve intercepts particle @xmath4 and makes an orthogonal measurement in the basis @xmath36 .",
    "suppose particle @xmath4 is found in state @xmath37 , eve knows that the two - particle states of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is @xmath38 , @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 respectively , or @xmath41 , @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "then she sends it to bob .",
    "when particle @xmath5 comes , she intercepts it too and measures it in the basis @xmath45 and then sends it to bob . if eve sees that particle @xmath5 is in @xmath46 or @xmath47 , then obviously she knows that the two - particle state is @xmath38or @xmath39 . in this case",
    "she is lucky enough to conceal from alice and bob for the two - particle state is not disturbed . and if eve finds particle @xmath5 in state @xmath48 , then the two - particle state is @xmath41 or @xmath42 , which has collapsed to @xmath49 , then bob has the partial probability of @xmath50 or @xmath51 to find the two - particle state in @xmath41 or @xmath52 respectively .",
    "so it is clear that for the case eve measures the particle @xmath4 in the state @xmath53 , the probability for he to eavesdrop without being detected is @xmath54 analyzed in the same way , the total probability that eve eavesdrops the key information without being detected is @xmath55 then it is evident that @xmath56 gets the minimal value of @xmath57 when @xmath58 .",
    "we depict this set of states in the @xmath7 hilbert space in a visual graphical way as figure 1 shows .",
    "the four dominoes represent the four pairs of states that involve superposition of the basis states @xmath59 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "it is obvious that this figure is @xmath62-fold rotation symmetric , and we will show later that this symmetry is one of the basic requirements for there may be two symmetrical eavesdropping strategies . from this figure",
    "we can obviously see that all the states included in one row , where particle @xmath4 is in basis states , can be eavesdropped without being detected in this strategy .",
    "but for all other states , there is only certain probability , the quartic of probability amplitude of the superposition states of particle @xmath4 in the basis states , for eve s success eavesdropping .",
    "then the total probability is @xmath56 .",
    "now let s consider the case of @xmath1 system .",
    "since we only utilize orthogonal product states , and any superposition of @xmath8 basis states that covers all the grids of any row ( any column ) in the graphic depiction will surely be distinguished by eve which will have no use in the present qkd scheme .",
    "in other words , any set of states including such superposition state will violate the above conditions , then the possible superposition states can just be the ones of less than @xmath8 basis states which cover no more than @xmath63 grids of the figures .",
    "the @xmath64 system can be depicted in figure 2 .",
    "we can see that the only difference between the figures of the @xmath0 and @xmath64 systems is that there are four states in the center of the @xmath64 system , which can be eavesdropped without being detected .",
    "then generalized straightforwardly , the @xmath65 system can be analyzed in the similar way as the @xmath66 system .",
    "thus here we take the @xmath66 system for example . @xmath67 .",
    "the figure 3 depicts a set of orthogonal product states of the @xmath68 system , which is generalized straightforwardly from @xmath7 system . for any complete set of orthogonal product states , the success probability for eve to eavesdropping without being detected",
    "is @xmath69 /25,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the probability amplitude of the superposition states of particle @xmath4 in the basis states and @xmath71 for any @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath14 , and @xmath74 means that particle @xmath5 is in the basis state @xmath74 , @xmath73 denotes dominoes in line @xmath74 , @xmath75 denotes the superposition states in domino @xmath73 , and @xmath76 denotes the basis states that superposition state @xmath75 involves , @xmath56 is eve s success probability for the @xmath7 system and @xmath77 is the probability for states in row @xmath78 and @xmath79 . we know from the graph that the dominoes in column @xmath80 and @xmath81 cover @xmath62 grids in total ( if @xmath82 grids are covered , all the states in this column can be eavesdropped without being detected . ) , and we have shown that @xmath83 . it can be proved easily that @xmath84 reaches its minimal value @xmath85 when @xmath56 gets its minimal value and only one domino is in column @xmath80 or @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this corresponds to the set of states depicted in figure 3 .",
    "then for the @xmath88 system , the success probability is @xmath89 /(2n+1)^2.\\ ] ] the minimal probability can be obtained similarly : @xmath90 /(2n+1)^2=1/2+(1 + 4n)/2(2n+1)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",
    "we can deduce immediately that this value approaches @xmath92 when @xmath8 gets large enough .    of course , there are other ways of plotting the graph symmetrically .",
    "but this set of states is of the most secure .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath93 can be deduced straightforwardly from the symmetry of the plot . for any vertical domino contributes @xmath94 to this value , any state in the horizontal dominoes and the state in the center each contributes @xmath94 .",
    "due to the symmetry , there are at least @xmath95 vertical or horizontal dominoes and @xmath96 /2 $ ] states in the horizontal dominoes .    for the @xmath65 system",
    ", the same result can be reached .",
    "that is to say there is a limitation in the probability of the success eavesdropping when the hilbert space becomes large enough .",
    "and it is evident that in this strategy only particle @xmath4 may be demolished , and particle @xmath5 is not infected at all .",
    "the function of the operation to @xmath5 which is depended on the result of the measurement on @xmath4 is just to extract more information .",
    "eve may adopt the complementary eavesdropping strategy , in which eve try to eavesdrop some information by intercepting and operating only on the second particle @xmath5 , which may cause demolition to it .",
    "then for the set of states in @xmath1 systems , whose graphic depictions are @xmath62-fold rotation symmetric , the probability to eavesdrop some information without being detected is equal to that of the first strategy , i.e. , @xmath97 . but for those states without such symmetry , it can be verified that one of the success probabilities for the complementary strategies is larger than @xmath97 .",
    "so we employ the symmetric states in the present scheme .",
    "of course , there are other strategies , for example , she can hold up the first particle @xmath4 and send out a substitute particle @xmath98 to bob .",
    "when @xmath5 comes , she makes a collective measurement under the two - particle orthogonal basis , then sends out a particle @xmath99 in the state of @xmath5 . in this strategy ,",
    "eve can eavesdrop the information entirely , but the probability for she to pass the checking process is only @xmath100 , which tends to zero , for the state of particle @xmath98 is randomly chosen from a @xmath8 hilbert space .",
    "we have proposed the general conditions for the orthogonal product states to be used in qkd , then presented a qkd scheme with the orthogonal product states of @xmath7 system which has several distinct features , such as high efficiency and great capacity .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath8-state systems , and eavesdropping is analyzed where a peculiar limitation , @xmath9 for the success probability of an efficient eavesdropping strategy is found as _  _",
    "@xmath8 _",
    "_ becomes large enough ."
