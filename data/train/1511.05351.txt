    "many crop plants of major significance that produce seeded fruit display alternate bearing , in which a year of heavy crop yield , known as a mast year , is followed by a year of extremely light yield and vice versa .",
    "this causes a cascading effect throughout the ecosystem , including leading to serious health problems for human beings @xcite . the alternate bearing phenomenon is quite common , and",
    "has been observed in wild plants in forests as well as domesticated plants .",
    "understanding the dynamics of this natural phenomenon is a difficult task due to the complexities involved in the natural systems , and the limitations of experimental design and verification . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to illuminate some of the dynamical complexities of this phenomenon .",
    "various attempts have been made to determine the characteristics of the alternate bearing phenomenon , including , but not limited to , discussions in refs .",
    "however isagi @xcite were the first to attempt to study the characteristics of the phenomenon using a simple mathematical model which captures some of its key behaviors .",
    "however , even after this proposition , except for a few attempts @xcite , this system has not been studied in detail . in this work , we endeavor to study this system in detail and correlate the mathematical model with the ecological behavior .",
    "isagi @xcite proposed the following model based on the energy resource present in a plant : a constant amount of photosynthate is produced every year in individual plant .",
    "this photosynthate is used for growth and maintenance of the plant .",
    "the remaining photosynthate ( @xmath3 ) is stored within the plant body .",
    "the accumulated photosynthate stored in the plant is expressed as @xmath4 . for a particular year , if the accumulated photosynthate ( @xmath5 ) exceed a certain threshold @xmath6 , then the remaining amount @xmath7 is used for flowering , with the cost of flowering expressed as @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "these flowers are pollinated and bear fruits , the cost of which is designated as @xmath10 . usually , under relatively stable conditions , the fruiting cost is proportional to the cost of flowering , , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a proportionality constant .",
    "after flowering , the leftover accumulated photosynthate is @xmath6 .",
    "once fruiting is over , this is reduced to @xmath13 , , @xmath14 . however , in non - mast years the accumulated energy becomes @xmath15 .",
    "this phenomenon , considering @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is modeled @xcite as follows :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 represent the years and @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath12 is considered as a parameter for this model . since",
    "this model is based on energy ( photosynthate ) stored in a plant it is termed a resource budget model @xcite . here , we explore the characteristic behavior of this model , considering it significance with reference to previous discussions @xcite . in this work",
    "we explain the reason of existence of chaotic bands and their merging .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 bands chaotic attractors become @xmath1 bands when the period-@xmath0 unstable fixed points simultaneously collide with the chaotic bands .    in this model @xmath6 and @xmath3",
    "are generally considered to be constants for mature trees .",
    "however , the branches of a natural tree may sometimes be cut , or suffer some destruction , which implies that there must be some variation in @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , due to weather fluctuations or other sources of external disturbances , the yearly photosynthate production , and therefore the quantity @xmath21 , also does not remain constant . here , we examine the importance of variations in @xmath6 and @xmath21 to explore their effects on the characteristic behavior of the system , and correlation with the real - world phenomenon of alternate bearing .",
    "results show that the ratio of cost of fruiting to the cost of flowering , which occurs in multi - bands regime , does not get changed due to the yearly variations in photosynthesis ( when yearly photosynthesis exceeds certain critical value ) .",
    "however the initial distance between the chaotic bands does depend on photosynthesis .",
    "this model looks like as a tent map , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) @xcite",
    ". however , it can be seen that if @xmath22 is below @xmath23 then it does not depend on parameter @xmath12 , the slope is always one . as discussed below",
    ", this independence leads to new results compared to standard tent maps @xcite  this leads to the creation of separate chaotic bands which are useful for understanding the phenomenon of alternate bearing .",

    "[ fig : small](b ) shows another island , as shown in the inset . a period@xmath45 fixed point passes across this island .    in general , there are an infinite number of islands , which contain period-@xmath46 fixed points , created near to @xmath38 .",

    "therefore , the distance between these two fixed points is @xmath62 , , the starting separation of the chaotic bands which appear above and below the unstable fixed is dependent on @xmath3 only .",
    "therefore , similar bifurcation diagrams , as those given in figs .",
    "[ fig : bif ] and [ fig : small ] , are observed for different values @xmath21 ( figures are shown here ) .",
    "note that the upper fixed point , @xmath60 is independent of @xmath21 ; hence , irrespective of the values of @xmath21 , the fixed point remains at @xmath63 .",
    "however , the fixed point @xmath64 , which depends on @xmath21 , moves up to @xmath63 as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "ecologically , this dependency of @xmath54 on @xmath3 suggests that , if there is high value of photosynthate in a particular year ( for example , with more sunshine , or less snow fall or clouds ) then there will be a huge difference in seed output in the following years .",
    "this means that , as per the above discussion , the distance @xmath54 , and hence the separation of the upper and lower chaotic bands will be large .",
    "this simple model thus explains the important ecological phenomenon of alternate bearing , explaining origin and variation in magnitude of the effect of the alternate bearing .",
    "this also predicts that if there is a very high value of yearly photosynthesis , then one can expect alternate bearing to be observed in the next year",
    ". note that if yearly photosynthesis is less in a plant then there will be small fluctuation in @xmath4 around @xmath6 , and hence the the magnitude of variations in yields across the years will also be less .",

    "[ fig : small](a ) near to @xmath66 shows that two bands chaos are merged into a single band when the period-@xmath2 unstable fixed point collides with the two bands of chaotic attractors .",
    "this collision is termed a band - merging crisis @xcite .",
    "one method to detect such a crisis is to determine the variance in @xmath67 after @xmath46-iterations , within the regime of two bands , the trajectory visits each band alternately , while in the single merged band the trajectory may move anywhere .",
    "therefore , when a crisis occurs there is large jump in the variance of @xmath22 .",
    "this is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : d](a ) , where a clear jump can be seen at @xmath68 , when two bands merge .",
    "similarly , at @xmath69 , four bands of chaotic attractors become two bands , as the upper and lower period-2 unstable fixed points each collide with the attractor bands .",
    "also , sixteen chaotic bands become 8 bands at the point at which the period-8 unstable fixed points collide separately at lower values of @xmath42 .",
    "these band merging crises are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d](a ) .",
    "this figure is generated by finding the variance in @xmath22 after @xmath70 iterations ( for detection of crises up to the merging of @xmath53 bands ) .",
    "note that , due to the infinitely small width of these bands ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] ) , the higher order merging crisis that it is possible to detect numerically is the merging of the 32 bands containing the period-32 fixed points .",
    "this shows that , near to @xmath38 , the @xmath0 bands chaotic attractors become @xmath1 bands when the period-@xmath0 fixed points simultaneously collide with the chaotic bands . the infinite number of chaotic bands created near to @xmath38 start to merge on further increase of @xmath42 .",
    "this process of merging ends when the period-1 fixed point collides with the remaining two bands of chaos near to @xmath66 .",
    "this regime , in which collision occurs , is labeled as @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : small](a ) ,   from @xmath38 to the values of @xmath71 where the two bands of chaos become one band of chaos . in order to see how the width of the multi - band regime @xmath65 changes with @xmath21",

    "[ fig : d](b ) .",
    "the black circles and red squares correspond to the two values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively . in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : d](b ) , it can be seen that the perfect overlapping of these values shows that the variation of @xmath65 with @xmath21 is independent of @xmath63 .",
    "a fit to the these curves shows that it is a nonlinear function of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are fitting parameters .",
    "this function is shown for @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ fig : d](b ) as a dashed blue line , with fitting parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "one important observation is that at smaller values of @xmath21 @xmath80 there is drastic change in @xmath65 .",
    "however , for large values it becomes saturated around @xmath81 , , @xmath82 .",
    "note that the alternate bearing occurs when the values of @xmath12 , , ratio of cost of fruiting to the cost of flowering , is in these multi - bands regime ( for @xmath83 ) .",
    "since @xmath65 is independent of @xmath21 ( after the photosynthate , @xmath84 which is always expected ) implies that @xmath12 does not get changed due to the yearly variation in photosynthate .",
    "one remarkable observation is that this value @xmath85 is very close to the value of @xmath86 estimated from field data @xcite . therefore the present analysis explains / supports this important characteristic of ecological alternate bearing phenomenon .",
    "the slight deviation in these numerical and experimental values could be due to the external fluctuation as discussed below .",
    "note that this saturation values of @xmath12 may be different for different type of plants , and may depends on regions and climates @xcite  which needs to be probed further .",
    "natural systems are rarely free from external perturbations .",
    "therefore , in order to fully understand the dynamics of this system , we must also consider the effect of noise . here , we consider uniformly distributed random noise in @xmath22 , with values between @xmath87 $ ] and strength @xmath88 .",
    "we add this noise after each iteration of the map , eq .",

    "[ fig : noise](a ) shows the bifurcation diagram generated with noise of strength @xmath90 ( @xmath91 of signal @xmath4 ) for fixed @xmath72 and @xmath92 .",

    "[ fig : bif](a ) .",
    "the islands and the distance @xmath54 still persist under noise .    to understand the effects of the variations of @xmath3 cause by this noise ,",

    "the fits to these datasets , using the function eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , show similar trends to that without noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] ) .",
    "however , the saturation distance @xmath65 decreases for higher strength of noise .",
    "therefore , the results presented in this work reveals that , under natural conditions in which fluctuations always exist , the characteristic properties @xmath54 and @xmath65 of alternate bearing phenomenon can persist .",
    "piecewise - smooth dynamical systems , which model many natural phenomena , are well studied and found to be important to understand the systems .",
    "piecewise - linear maps have been also well studied ( see recent paper @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    ", we have studied the resource budget model which captures the phenomenon of alternate bearing in plants .",
    "however the map we considered here , eq . ( [ eq : model ] ) , is different to standard tent maps @xcite . in this model ,",
    "one side ( @xmath94 ) has a constant coefficient linear equation , while in all reported works the slopes of both sides change",
    ". therefore this work adds a new class of map to tent - type maps , and we were able to study the variations of @xmath54 and @xmath65 . from a mathematical point of view , it is important to study this new class of tent map in detail .",
    "this system shows rich bifurcation behavior , where infinite islands containing period-@xmath46 unstable orbits are observed .",
    "the islands are destroyed due to band merging crises when the unstable fixed points collide with chaotic bands .",
    "we found that the distance @xmath54 only depends on @xmath3 and independent of @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that if there is a high value of photosynthate in a year then there will be a huge difference in seed output in the next year .",
    "this variation is independent of the threshold value @xmath6 of the individual tree .",
    "therefore , this simple model demonstrates the characteristic properties of an ecological phenomenon , explaining the magnitude and variation of alternate bearing .",
    "we observe that only for smaller values of @xmath21 there is drastic change in @xmath65 .",
    "however , for large values @xmath65 is saturated at approximately @xmath95 , which is very close to estimations from real data @xcite .",
    "this shows that variations in the ratio of cost of fruiting to cost of flowering does not dependent on the amount of photosynthate .    these results",
    ", the independence of @xmath6 on @xmath54 and the saturation of regime of multi - bands , may be useful for ecological perspectives and hence its open up to new challenges for further analysis and verification in experimental situations .",
