    "random walks and diffusion processes have been the subject of constant interest in mathematics and in physics during the last century , for two main reasons ( i ) they play a central role in probability theory , and present a large number of very nice mathematical properties ( ii ) they naturally appear in a great variety of situations in physics and in biology .",
    "it is thus important to understand the effects of quenched disorder on random walks : are the usual properties of random walks stable with respect to the presence of some disorder or inhomogeneity ? if not , what are the new properties induced by disorder ? among the various types of random walks in random media that have been considered in the past ( see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) , we wish to focus here on the case of random walks in a two - dimensional self - affine random potential @xmath10 . in a continuous framework",

    ", the model is not exactly solvable , but from scaling arguments on barriers , one still expects the analogous logarithmic scaling @xcite @xmath23 however , to the best of our knowledge , this behavior has not been much tested , except in the preliminary unpublished numerical results of pettini shown on fig .",

    "[ wijnew ] @xmath95 the physical meaning of this rule is the following . the exit rate out of the position @xmath82 decays because the previous transition towards @xmath76 can lead to an immediate return towards @xmath82 . after the decimation of the position @xmath76 , this process is not considered as an exit process anymore , but as a residence process in the position @xmath82 .",
    "this point is very important to understand the meaning of the renormalization procedure : the remaining positions at a given renormalization scale are formally microscopic positions of the initial master equation ( eq . [ master ] ) , but each of these remaining microscopic position actually represents some valley in position space that takes into account all the previously decimated positions .",

    "we refer to @xcite for more detailed explanations . in practice ,",
    "the renormalized rates @xmath96 can rapidly become very small as a consequence of the multiplicative structure of the renormalization rule of eq [ wijnew ] .",

    "the barrier @xmath97 from @xmath11 to @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 and similarly the exit barrier out of position @xmath11 is defined by @xmath100 a very important advantage of this formulation in terms of the renormalized transition rates of the master equation is that the renormalized barriers take into account the true barriers of the dynamics , whatever their origin which can be either energetic or entropic .",
