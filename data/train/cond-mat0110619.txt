    "electronic raman scattering is a very useful probe in determining the symmetry of the order parameter of superconductors ( sc).@xcite they play especially important roles in the study of unconventional superconductors owing to the strong dependence of raman responses on the symmetry of superconducting order parameters . along with the discovery of high temperature superconductors ,",
    "other unconventional superconductors have been actively investigated , for example , borocarbide superconductors ( bcsc ) @xcite @xmath2 , and ruthenate superconductors@xcite @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter of high temperature sc and ruthenate sc is believed to be @xmath4-wave@xcite and @xmath5-wave@xcite , respectively .",
    "however , the symmetry of the order parameter of bcsc has not been determined unambiguously at present .",
    "nevertheless , there are growing experimental evidences for the strongly anisotropic nature of order paramter of bcsc .",
    "the band structure calculations@xcite and @xmath6 versus @xmath7 plot @xcite suggest strong electron - phonon interaction as a possible origin of bcsc . in general",
    ", the superconductivity mediated by electron - phonon interaction has an isotropic @xmath8-wave superconducting gap ( sg ) , and the nodes of gap on fermi surface ( fs ) do not exist .",
    "on the other hand , the following experiments indicate the existence of the nodes of sg : ( 1 ) the power law temperature dependence ( @xmath9 ) of nuclear relaxation rate @xcite @xmath10 suggests the existence of line nodes of the superconducting gap on fermi surface.@xcite moreover , hebel - slichter peak is not observed @xcite , which is also consistent with the existence of nodes .",
    "( 2 ) the magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) dependence of residual density of states in the vortex state@xcite was observed to be @xmath12 . according to the well - known result by volovik@xcite",
    ", the @xmath12 indicates the existence of lines of gap nodes on fs .",
    "( 3 ) v. metlushko _ et al . _",
    "reported an observation of the fourfold symmetric upper critical field.@xcite evidently , such a behavior is not compatible with the isotropic @xmath8-wave gap , and has been interpreted in terms of _ three _ dimensional @xmath4-wave superconductivity.@xcite ( 4 ) the _ direct _ measurement of sg by photoemission spectroscopy@xcite also demonstrates the existence of nodes of sg .",
    "( 5 ) the recent experiment by e. boaknin _ et al .",
    "_ on the thermal conductivity of @xmath13 shows that the magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity at low temperature is very similar to that of a heavy fermion sc with gap which has _ lines of nodes_.@xcite    the above experimental facts ( 1)-(5 ) clearly corroborate a gapless superconductivity , and the simplest of which is @xmath4-wave superconductivity .",
    "however , the following experiments for the bcsc with ni substituted by some impurity element as pt pose serious challenges for the @xmath4-wave scenario : ( 6 ) the magnetic field @xmath11 dependence of residual density of states in the vortex state@xcite changes from @xmath12 to @xmath11 upon the impurity substitution . caroli _ _ et al.__@xcite showed that the @xmath11 dependence is linear for the isotropic @xmath8-wave sc .",
    "( 7 ) the detailed plot of @xmath14 $ ] versus @xmath15 also demonstrates the change of behavior from @xmath9 to the activated one.@xcite ( 8) the photoemission experiment shows the opening of gap over the whole fs for impurity substituted compound by comparing the shapes of the spectra of pure and dirty bcsc .",
    "the experiments for the dirty bcsc ( 6)-(8 ) imply the gap symmetry can not be a simple d - wave because the introduction of impurities does not change the gap anisotropy owing to the d - wave symmetry@xcite , and only overall amplitudes decrease with the impurity concentrations . in connection with the experiments for the diry bcsc we note that the superconducting temperature of conventional @xmath8-wave sc is insensitive to the introduction of non - magnetic impurities , which is the fact known as anderson theorem@xcite , while the unconventional sc depend on them sensitively.@xcite    finally there is no experimental evidence of broken tetragonal symmetry , thus we are forced to rule out pairing interactions which violate tetragonal symmetry .    synthesizing all of the above observations , ( 1)-(5 ) , ( 6)-(8 ) , and the unbrokent tetragonal symmetry ,",
    "we are led to a proposal that the gap symmetry of bcsc should be a mixed one which respects the tetragonal symmetry . obviously , the simplest possible candidate is the @xmath0-wave gap symmetry .",
    "the gap function of the form @xmath16 is also a viable choice , but the nodes of the gap of this kind are accidental and are not enforced by symmetry . from the symmetry viewpoint , @xmath0-wave gap is more natural .",

    "[ see fig . 5 ]    we intend to understand the qualitative features of the above raman experiments based on the simplest model with @xmath0-wave gap symmetry .",
    "we adopt the weak coupling theory with separable pairing interaction . then",
    ", even if the physical origin of pairing interaction is unknown , we can deduce many physical consequences which mainly depend on the pairing symmetry not on the details of interactions .",
    "strictly speaking , the weak coupling theory is not expected to valid on a quantitative level , and indeed the band theory calculation predicts the electron - phonon interaction to lie in the strong coupling regime . nevertheless , we believe that the qualititave features might be understood with the simple weak coupling model .",
    "we find that the relative peak positions and the nature of scattering strengh below @xmath17 gap can be understood naturally , while the weak and broad @xmath1 peak features can not be explained in a simple weak coupling theory with @xmath0-wave gap symmetry .",
