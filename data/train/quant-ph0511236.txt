    "like quantum state diffusion@xcite , non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( nmqsd)@xcite was originally introduced as an exact computational method for finding the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary subsystem interacting linearly with the radiation field . in practice",
    "the evolution equation proved impossible to solve except in a few cases where exact solutions were already known@xcite .",
    "recently we reformulated nmqsd in terms of a solvable integrodifferential equation and demonstrated the use of the modified method by solving a number of example problems@xcite . here",
    "we present a detailed and general derivation of the modified equations for an arbitrary number of coupling operators .",
    "we also apply the resulting theory to intermittent fluorescence in driven @xmath0mg@xmath1 which arises due to quantum jumps between bright and dark electronic states .",
    "ion trap experiments have become an important subfield of quantum optics .",
    "theory@xcite and experiments@xcite on quantum jump phenomena in single ions are motivating further attempts to understand the measurement process@xcite .",
    "such ions have been used as models of quantum computers@xcite , and there are many interesting possibilities when optical lattices are employed@xcite . in many cases",
    "the subsystem of interest in these experiments can be modeled as a driven few level system interacting linearly with the radiation field .",
    "nmqsd is an exact dynamical theory for such systems which should in principle make theoretical analysis of such experiments a simple task .",
    "unfortunately , standard formulations of nmqsd rely on a stochastic variational - differential equation ( vde ) for dynamical evolution which can not be solved - even numerically - outside of a few special cases where solutions were already known .",
    "some approximation schemes have recently been explored@xcite , but exact numerical schemes remain an important goal .    in a recent manuscript we argued that nmqsd can be reformulated in terms of a solvable stochastic integrodifferential equation@xcite .",
    "we solved a number of example problems - some previously unsolvable - with the reformulated equations and found that accurate solutions to few level problems were readily obtainable .",
    "the efficiency of the method is partly a consequence of the availability of improved methods for solving stochastic differential equations ( sdes)@xcite . in this manuscript",
    "we apply the reformulated theory to @xmath0mg@xmath1 .",
    "our results confirm speculation that quantum jumps occur on short time scales@xcite .",
    "we show that both markovian and non - markovian quantum state diffusion predict the two peaked distribution seen in experiments .",
    "in addition both theories give the correct ratio for the areas under the peaks .",
    "we also find that the mathematical lineshape functions are very similar for both theories even though the peaks appear qualitatively different in the two cases .",
    "the derivation of the reformulated equations for nmqsd is outlined in section ii .",
    "the equations and their numerical implementation are discussed in section iii . in section",

    "we will also assume a bath temperature of 0 k and hence an initial state of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the lowest eigenstate of @xmath5 .",
    "we will first show that the reduced density @xmath6 can be rewritten as an average over diadics @xmath7.\\ ] ] to do this we will express the trace over bath modes as integrals over coherent states @xmath8 , @xmath9 for each oscillator .",

    "note that for more general hamiltonians where there are many coupling operators @xmath20 which couple to different modes of the bath it is necessary to use a appropriate generalization of the trotter product formula to separate the subsystem hamiltonian @xmath21 and coupling operators @xmath20 in separate factors .",

    "the background model function was the same as in the non - markovian case .",
    "the ratio of areas extracted was 16.8 .",
    "this minor discrepancy is likely due to lack of monte - carlo convergence .",
    "thus , we are able to verify the ratio of areas in both the markovian and non - markovian cases .",
    "the mathematical form of the histogram seems to vary little from the markovian to non - markovian cases even though the parameters and appearance of the two distributions are quite different .",
    "this is encouraging since it may be possible in future to obtain time resolved experimental histograms which could be compared to theory to see whether there is agreement of mathematical forms .",

    "the reformulated theory has been tested against exact results for a number of problems , and employed to investigate a number of problems for which exact solutions are not known@xcite .",
    "we expect that the method will prove useful for many few - level - system problems in quantum optics .",
    "in this manuscript we applied the theory to the problem of intermittent fluorescence in @xmath0mg@xmath1 .",
    "previous applications of markovian quantum state diffusion to quantum jumps in @xmath0mg@xmath1 treated all parameters as free variables@xcite , and hence can not be considered predictive .",
    "our more careful study shows that quantum jumps do indeed occur on picosecond timescales as had been speculated earlier@xcite .",
    "we also computed the probability distribution function for signal intensity and obtained the characteristic two peaks corresponding to fluorescence on and off .",
    "our results show that both markovian and non - markovian versions of nmqsd reproduce the experimental and theoretical result that the ratio of the area under the bright peak is 16 times that of the area under the dark peak .",
    "we found that while the markovian and non - markovian distribution functions looked qualitatively different , they in fact share a very similar mathematical form .",
    "this raises a number of interesting possibilities .",
    "first , if time resolved experiments are possible it may be possible to verify the shape the histogram experimentally . this would be a much stronger result than the simple ratio of areas .",
    "secondly , it raises the possibility of using the jump experiment to measure properties of the radiation field , since the qualitative shape of the histogram is sensitive to the memory function which contains quite a lot of information about the distribution of frequencies and temperature .                    see for example d.t .",
