    "<S> an alternative scenario for the observed trend could invoke modifications of the non - local shg contribution enhanced by a regular array structure . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the non - local shg was already demonstrated in a number of subwavelength - separated plasmonic nanoobjects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and phase of this non - local shg source depends on the electric field distribution , i.e. on both the pillar size @xmath15 and the periodicity @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> as such , the interference conditions between the shg sources vary for different samples , thus resulting in a strong modification of the shg output .    </S>",
    "<S> further , the apparent difference in the shape of the resonant shg output for the 4h and 6h samples ( see fig .  [ shifts ] ) is related to the anisotropic nature of sic . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal sic polytypes are known to exhibit zone - folded weak modes in the reststrahlen region @xcite originating from particular stacking of the atomic layers along the _ </S>",
    "<S> c_-axis of the crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these weakly ir - active zone - folded modes can be visualised in the reflectivity measurements at oblique incidence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although zone - folded modes exist in both 4h and 6h polytypes , different stacking of the sic atomic layers is responsible for them having different frequencies , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ analysis],c - d . </S>",
    "<S> the additional periodicity in the crystal results in folding of the large brillouin zone thus modifying the phonon dispersion and making the excitation of phonons with non - zero wavevectors ( @xmath25 ) possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ analysis],d that the zone - folded mode in the 6h - sic polytype with the reduced wavevector @xmath26 @xmath27 can be excited in the range of @xmath28  @xmath3 which is close to the typical monopole sphp resonant frequency of the sic nanopillars discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the interaction of the sphp and zone - folded mode which shifted the apparent spectral positions of the monopole sphp eigenmode in the linear response @xcite , is seen responsible for the complex structure of the resonant shg output in our experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ shifts],d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weak ir activity of the zone - folded modes is related to the large negative dielectric permittivity of sic in the reststrahlen band . as such , the out - of - plane component of the electromagnetic field @xmath10 remains small which inhibits the coupling of incident light to the zone - folded phonon mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excitation of the sphp monopole mode in the nanopillars drives a strong increase of @xmath10 , which facilitates the sphp monopole interaction with the zone - folded phonon ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ analysis],c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ analysis],a illustrates the effect of the zone - folded mode on the observed shg output . </S>",
    "<S> the open red squares ( 4h ) and blue circles ( 6h ) depict the shg intensity obtained at the sphp monopole ( resonant ) frequencies , and the dashed lines illustrate a clear correlation between the maximum shg output and the spectral position of the sphp monopole peak . </S>",
    "<S> similar trends are observed for the 4h and 6h - sic samples as long as the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode are well - separated . </S>",
    "<S> when these two resonances start to overlap , an additional enhancement of the shg output produced at the sphp monopole resonance in 6h - sic samples is observed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dependence of the shg signal at the frequency of the zone - folded mode @xmath29  @xmath3 ( green triangles ) exhibits a much faster increase when the two resonances are brought together ( dotted line ) , indicating an efficient interplay between the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the interaction of the localized sphp eigenmodes and the intrinsic excitations of the medium is a unique fingerprint of mid - ir nanophononics . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , surface plasmon excitations in metals rely on the free electron gas , which is essentially isotropic . as such , the shg output of plasmonic nanostructures is ( i ) largely determined by the metal of choice , usually au , ( ii ) exhibits only weak spectral dependence @xcite and ( iii ) is limited by robust phase relations in the likely case of multiple shg sources @xcite . on the contrary , the flexibility of the sphps is provided by the coupling of the surface phonon polariton excitations to the intrinsic bulk phonon modes . the latter can be engineered by designing artificial metamaterials based on hybrid multilayer structures @xcite , thus allowing for an effective control of their optical properties . to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed shg output enhancement associated with the excitation of the sphp eigenmodes in an array of nanopillars grown from sic of different polytypes . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest shg output is associated with the excitation of the monopole sphp mode characterized by strong localization of the normal to surface projection of the electric field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral positions of the shg peaks shift according to the geometric parameters of the nanophononic structures . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong dependence of the magnitude of the shg enhancement on the resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this experimentally observed dependence can not be quantitatively described by simply taking into account the sub - diffractional field localization and the dispersion of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of sic . </S>",
    "<S> further , we discuss the interplay of the sphps and the intrinsic crystalline anisotropy for an efficient nonlinear - optical conversion . this mechanism is supported by the shg spectral measurements on the 6h - sic nanopillars where excitation of the sphp monopole mode interacting with the weak zone - folded phonon resulted in an additional enhancement of the shg output . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of intrinsic resonances strongly alters the phase relations in their vicinity , providing a natural way for optimizing the shg response in a relatively narrow spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> our findings demonstrate high potential of mid - ir nonlinear nanophononics as a novel and promising platform for nonlinear optics and illustrate the rich opportunities it provides for efficient control over nonlinear - optical response .    </S>",
