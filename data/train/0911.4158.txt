    "it is well known that the quantum entanglement deteriorates very fast due to environmental interactions and one would like to find methods that can save or at least slow down the loss of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is also now known that quantum entanglement can die much faster than the scale over which dephasing occurs @xcite .",
    "for example the coherence of the qubit typically lasts over a time scale of the order of @xmath2 whereas the entanglement can exhibit sudden death and thus it is important to extend the techniques used for single qubits to bipartite and even multipartite systems . in this paper",
    "we examine how the pulse techniques which were developed to examine the issue of dephasing can help in saving the entanglement .",
    "the quantum dynamical decoupling @xcite uses a sequence of control pulses to be used on the system at an interval much less than the time - scale of the bath coherence time . in this way ,",
    "the coupling of the system to the bath can be time - reversed and thus canceled .",
    "such non - markovian approach has been successfully applied to two - level systems , harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "a different approach was used in @xcite where a control pulse was applied to a different transition rather than the relevant two - level transition .",
    "this technique shows that the control pulse causes destructive interference between transition amplitudes at different times which leads to inhibition of the spontaneous emission of an excited atom .",
    "similar techniques could be useful to suppress the decoherence of a qubit coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "other methods for protection against dephasing are known .",
    "these include application of fast modulations to the bath @xcite as well as decoherence free subspaces @xcite .",
    "the dynamical decoupling idea has been implemented in a few recent experiments @xcite with excitons in semiconductors , with rydberg atomic qubits , with solid state qubits and with nuclear spin qubits .",
    "more recent developments primarily due to uhrig @xcite go far beyond than what has been done earlier on dynamical decoupling .",
    "the dynamical decoupling schemes use a series of @xmath0 pulses applied at regular interval of times .",
    "the pulses reverse the evolution given by the hamiltonian describing the interaction with a dephasing environment .",
    "this is because under a @xmath0 pulse the spin operator @xmath3 reverses sign .",
    "uhrig discovered that @xmath0 pulses applied at irregular intervals of time are much more effective in controlling dephasing .",
    "the regular pulse sequence and the uhrig sequence are given by @xmath4    in this paper we focus on the utility of the sequence of pulses as discovered by uhrig in saving quantum entanglement . unlike other papers which focus on dephasing issues we concentrate on entanglement .",
    "this is important as the dynamical behavior of entanglement could be quite different than that of dephasing .",
    "we calculate the concurrence parameter @xcite which characterizes the entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "we show the net time evolution of the concurrence parameter under the action of the uhrig sequence of pulses and compare its evolution with the one given by when the uniform sequence of pulses is applied .",
    "we show the great advantage of the uhrig sequence over the uniform sequence in saving entanglement .",
    "a very recent experiment @xcite establishes the advantage of uhrig s sequence in lengthening the dephasing time of a single qubit .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec 2 we introduce the microscopic model of dephasing and calculate the relevant physical quantities under the influence of the control pulses . in sec 3",
    "we show how the coherent state techniques can be used to obtain the dynamical results . in sec 4",
    "we calculate the dynamics of entanglement and present numerical results . in sec 5",
    "we conclude with possible generalizations of our results on entanglement .",
    "let us consider two qubits in an entangled state @xcite which in general could be a mixed state . in terms of the basis states for the two qubits , we choose the initial state as @xmath5 @xmath6 the state ( [ 3 ] ) is positive and normalized if @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this state has the structure of a werner state . for @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , it represents a maximally entangled state .",
    "the amount of entanglement in the state is given by the concurrence given by @xmath11 and therefore the state is entangled as long as @xmath12 is greater than @xmath13 .",
    "now under dephasing the diagonal elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 do not change .",
    "however the coherence in the qubit decays as @xmath16 $ ] and therefore the entanglement survives as long as @xmath17-\\sqrt{ad}>0 $ ] and thus entanglement vanishes if @xmath18 .",
    "we would now examine how the action of pulses can protect the entanglement .",
    "we would calculate the time over which entanglement can be made to survive . for this purpose",
    "we need to examine the microscopic model of dephasing .",
    "we would make the reasonable assumption that each qubit interacts with its own bath .",
    "we could then examine the dynamics of the individual qubits and then obtain the evolution of the concurrence .    on a microscopic scale",
    "the dephasing can be considered to arise from the interaction of the qubit with a bath of oscillators i.e. from the hamiltonian @xmath19 where the @xmath3 is the @xmath20 component of the spin operator for the qubit and the annihilation and creation operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 represent the oscillators of the bosonic bath .",
    "the bath is taken to have a broad spectrum .",
    "in particular for an ohmic bath we take spectrum of bath as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cut off frequency .",
    "it essentially determines the correlation time of the bath .",
    "such a bath leads to dephasing i.e. the spin polarization decays at the rate @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical decoupling schemes use a series of @xmath0 pulses applied at regular interval of times whereas uhrig applies @xmath0 pulses at irregular intervals of time .",
    "such nonuniformly spaced pulses are much more effective in controlling dephasing over a time interval determined by the cut off frequency and number of pulses .",
    "the regular sequence of pulses is more effective outside this domain .",
    "the pulses reverse the evolution given by the interaction part in the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) since under a @xmath0 pulse the spin operator @xmath3 reverses sign . the regular pulse sequence and the uhrig sequence are given by equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we need to calculate the dynamical evolution of the off diagonal element of the density matrix for the qubit .",
    "we work in the interaction picture hence the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bath operator given by @xmath27    it is easy to see that the off diagonal element of the single qubit density matrix @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is over the initial bath density matrix @xmath31 and where @xmath32 this can be simplified to @xmath33 where @xmath34 thus we can write @xmath35 @xmath36    so far no approximation has been made .",
    "now we incorporate the effect of pulses in the dynamical evolution of the single qubit coherence .",
    "let us apply a sequence of @xmath0 pulses at times @xmath37 as shown in figure 1 . at each @xmath37",
    "the interaction hamiltonian changes sign .",
    "this can be easily incorporated in the dynamics and the result is @xmath38 where the step function @xmath39 if @xmath40 , if @xmath41 .",
    "it is especially instructive to use coherent state techniques to simplify the expression for @xmath42 .",
    "we do this in the next section .",
    "we now examine the calculation of the function @xmath43 . we note that the bath operator @xmath44 is such that the commutator @xmath45 $ ] is a c - number . in such a case",
    "it has been shown by glauber @xcite that the time ordering can be simplified .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath46f(\\tau_{1})f(\\tau_{2})\\}.\\ ] ] since @xmath47 is a hermitian operator , the last exponential is just a c - number phase factor and hence @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 on using the baker - hausdorff identity ( [ 18 ] ) can be further simplified to @xmath51 the thermal expectation value of @xmath42 can be easily obtained using for example the p - representation for the thermal density matrix @xcite @xmath52 thus @xmath53 which on simplification reduces to @xmath54 on using the form of @xmath55 and on introducing the spectral density of the bath oscillators , the expression ( [ 23 ] ) becomes @xmath56|f(\\omega)|^{2}\\},\\ ] ] where now @xmath57 the function @xmath58 can be simplified using the explicit form of @xmath59 : @xmath60.\\ ] ] the result ( [ 23 ] ) is equivalent to equation ( [ 8 ] ) of uhrig .",
    "we also note that results like ( 24 ) appear in the earlier literature @xcite dealing especially with nonmarkovian master equations .",
    "since we work under the assumption that each qubit interacts with its own bath , the time dependent matrix elements of the density matrix in the basis ( [ 2 ] ) can be obtained by noting that the diagonal elements do not evolve under dephasing .",
    "the off diagonal element @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined by equation ( [ 13 ] ) and its explicit form is given by equation ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath64 it can then be shown that the time dependence of the concurrence is given by @xmath65    we next discuss the dynamical behavior of the entanglement .",
    "the function @xmath66 has been evaluated by uhrig .",
    "for the pulses applied at regular intervals and for @xmath67 even we have @xmath68 whereas for the uhrig s pulse sequence @xmath69 is the bessel function .",
    "the function @xmath1 is shown in figures 2 and 3 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is a measure of the bath correlation time .",
    "these figures show that the entanglement lives much longer for uhrig sequence of pulses applied at nonuniform intervals of time provided that @xmath73 .",
    "thus entanglement can be made to live over times which could be several orders longer than the coherence time of the bath .",
    "in conclusion we have considered how the effects of dephasing on the destruction of entanglement can be considerably slowed on by applying the sequence of @xmath0 pulses applied at time intervals given by uhrig .",
    "we demonstrated this explicitly for the case of a mixed entangled state of two qubits .",
    "the sequence given by uhrig is far better in controlling the death of entanglement compared to the sequence applied at regular intervals of time .",
    "these conclusions also apply to the multiparticle entangled state like the ghz state @xmath74 would be @xmath75 under the application of @xmath0 pulses , the prefactor @xmath76 would be replaced by @xmath77 . since @xmath1 can be made close to unity for times even orders of the correlation time of the bath , the entanglement of the multiparticle ghz state would survive over a long time . note further that uhrig s work has been generalized to arbitrary relaxations @xcite .",
    "clearly these generalizations should be applicable to the considerations of entanglement .",
    "in particular we hope to examine the protection of werner state against different models of environment .",
