    "during recent years , several experimental realizations of nano - electromechanical ( nem ) resonators based on carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) or carbon nanofibers ( cnf ) have been demonstrated@xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes have established themselves as strong material candidates for use in nem - resonator systems , partly due to their favorable mechanical properties@xcite such as low mass and high elastic modulus .",
    "thus , using cnts / cnfs allows for operational frequencies of nem - resonators that reach into the ghz regime . in the most recent experiments , the long predicted high quality factors of the order of @xmath0 have finally been achieved",
    "this makes these resonators interesting from a technological point of view with application areas such as tunable rf - filters and fast low power switching elements@xcite .",
    "however , for such applications , a major drawback is the high impedance levels offered by single nanotube devices .",
    "the ensuing low power transduction@xcite makes integration of such devices with current state - of - the - art cmos technology difficult .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to construct devices based on parallel arrays . for arrays it is desirable to know how interactions betwen elements affect the operation of devices .",
    "it is for instance important to know how closely spaced array members can be placed without drastic changes in performance .",
    "apart from the technological incentive to study mem / nem arrays , the problem is also of fundamental interest .",
    "the dynamic response of coupled nem / mem - resonator systems in combination with nonlinearities is known to lead to unexpected and/or unintuitive behavior .",
    "examples are intrinsic localized modes@xcite and mode synchronization@xcite . in addition , parametric resonances in mem / nem arrays have been studied both experimentally and theoretically@xcite . in those studies",
    "parametric response was induced by applying an ac - voltage component between alternating beams in beam - arrays .",
    "parametric resonances can be narrower than fundamental resonances and finds use in for instance parametric amplifiers .",
    "in this paper we study theoretically a vertical one - dimensional regular array of cnt / cnf resonators ( see figure 1 ) . when the resonators are not too widely separated , electrostatic interactions between the tubes become important and affect the dynamical response of the system .",
    "while the system considered in this paper shares some features with previously studied systems@xcite , there are several important differences . among them",
    "two are worthy of special attention .",
    "firstly , all the tubes in the system are connected to the same voltage source , containing both a dc- and an ac - component , thereby eliminating the need for individual contacting of alternating array members .",
    "this makes the interactions between tubes repulsive , rather than attractive .",
    "secondly , in contrast to beams with rectangular cross - sections , where the characteristic vibration frequencies differ for vibrations in different directions , cnt / cnf have a circular cross - sections and motion in two dimensions plays an important role .",
    "we find that the fundamental resonance , where the tubes oscillate in unison towards the drain electrode , is not drastically affected by interactions .",
    "however , several new resonances appear including longitudinal resonances , where the tubes oscillate in the direction along the array . for small arrays ,",
    "these resonances have the form of hardening duffing type resonances which develop into a band of resonances as the array gets larger .",
    "further , two parametric resonances are present in the systems .",
    "both transverse as well as longitudinal motion may be parametrically excited , both with multiple branches and complex bifurcation structures for the larger arrays .",
    "the electrostatic coupling between tubes also affect the stability of the longitudinal motion which becomes unstable due to parametric excitation of transverse oscillations .",
    "we begin this paper by presenting , in section  [ sec : model ] , a simplified lumped electromechanical model to derive the main qualitative features of the system .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : general ] , based upon numerical integration of the equations of motion , the general features of the dynamic response of a one - dimensional cnt resonator array are discussed . to better understand the main characteristics of this response we focus on the the smallest possible array ( two tubes ) in section  [ sec : two_tubes ] .",
    "the two - tube system is treated both numerically and analytically .",
    "we derive frequency response equations and analyze stability for the various resonances using perturbation theory .",
    "these analytical results are found to work as good approximations for finding the loci of the resonances also in larger systems .",
    "this treatment is then followed up , in section  [ sec : several ] , with a discussion of how the response changes as the arrays become larger before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for an array consisting of @xmath1 tubes we denote the coordinates of the central axis of each ( undeformed ) tube by @xmath2 where @xmath3 . for the vibrations of the beams we consider only excitations of the fundamental flexural modes for which a lumped model is suitable@xcite . describing the position of the tip of the cantilevers by the coordinates",
    "@xmath4 we use the equations of motion@xcite : @xmath5 here @xmath6 are the effective masses of the tubes and @xmath7 the natural resonance frequencies . for tubes with circular cross sections these values are given by@xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cross - sectional area , @xmath11 the moment of inertia , @xmath12 the young modulus and @xmath13 the length of tube number @xmath14 .",
    "we have also introduced a viscoelastic damping term @xmath15 for each tube to account for mechanical losses . in the absence of a gaseous medium surronding the tubes",
    ", the main sources of dissipation are clamping losses and ohmic losses .    aside from elastic forces , external electrostatic forces @xmath16 act on the tubes .",
    "these forces depend on the geometry as well as the instantaneous charge distributions on the tubes . to find the exact charge distributions on the tubes",
    "is a hard problem .",
    "numerical simulations using fem and bem of electrostatically interacting tubes@xcite reveal that the charge is mainly located at the tip of the tubes .",
    "furthermore , the main contributions to the bending moments arise from forces close to the tube tips . thus to model the electrostatic forces we make the simplified assumption that the charge @xmath17 on each tube is concentrated to a conducting spherical shell located at the tip of each tube .",
    "the model we consider is one of conducting spheres , attached with springs to their equilibrium positions and being able to move in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "the drain electrode , which can be taken to be at zero potential , is modeled as an infinite conducting plane .",
    "there is also a possibility of actually having metallic grains on top the tubes . in plasma - cvd growth of cnt / cnf from ni catalysts , tip - growth results in the metallic catalysts residing at the tips of the tubes .    in general ,",
    "the full charge distribution , rather than the total charge , on each sphere is needed to find the forces .",
    "provided the intertube separation as well as the tube - drain separations are larger than the tube diameters , the dominant contribution to the electrostatic forces comes from the monopole contributions of these charge distributions . restricting attention to this case the electrostatic free energy of the system [ the tubes being biased by the common time - dependent voltage @xmath19 is @xmath20 where the electrostatic self - energy is @xmath21 and the total electrostatic interaction energy is @xmath22 here @xmath23 denote the images of @xmath24 in the plane @xmath25 .",
    "the charge distribution in the array is then found from solving the linear system @xmath26 after which the electrostatic forces may be found as @xmath27 .",
    "we consider now a uniform system with identical tubes , i.e. , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . rescaling the coordinates",
    "to dimensionless form according to @xmath32 , @xmath33 yields @xmath34 in the same way we rescale electric quantities through introducing a unit voltage @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the electrostatic charging energy @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless electrostatic free energy @xmath39 is then @xmath40    in order to study the response of the system we solve the dynamic equations  ( [ eq : dyneq ] ) numerically using a velocity - verlet algorithm . in the next section we present the main qualitative feutures of the mechanical response of the system to a harmonic driving field .",
    "a more quantitative discussion is then carried out in sections  [ sec : two_tubes ] and  [ sec : several ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:100a ] shows the response of an array with 100 tubes when it is driven with an ac - signal on the source in combination with a static dc - bias voltage @xmath41 ( dc - bias voltage @xmath42 v , ac - signal @xmath43 v ) .",
    "the tubes are each 1 @xmath44 m long with a diameter of 25 nm .",
    "the distance to the drain electrode is 150 nm .",
    "plotted are the two orthogonal components of the mechanical energy corresponding to transverse ( blue solid line ) and longitudinal vibrations ( red dashed lines ) .",
    "the energy is scaled in terms of the dimensionless units introduced above with a timescale set to @xmath45 ns .    in the top panel",
    "the spacing between the tubes is 200 nm . clearly visible is the primary transverse resonance ( blue lines ) where all the tubes oscillate in phase with each other .",
    "this mode corresponds to the resonance of a single nanotube .",
    "a band of longitudinal modes can be seen ( dashed line ) just above 100 mhz . in the middle panel",
    "the tubes are more closely spaced ( 150 nm ) and two additional resonances are present .",
    "the transverse ( around 190 mhz ) is a parametrically excited resonance where each tube oscillate with half the driving frequency . in this",
    "resonance neighboring tubes oscillate with opposing phases ( optical mode ) . above 210 mhz , is another parametric resonance in the more closely spaced arrays .",
    "this is a parametric resonance of the band of longitudinal modes of the array . in the bottom panel",
    "the spacing has been narrowed down further to 125 nm .",
    "the parametric resonances are now stronger and the primary transverse resonance has become hysteretic .",
    "the appearance of hysteresis can here be understood by considering the attractive force between a tube and the drain electrode .",
    "for widely separated tubes , each tube is attracted by its own image potential alone , while for more closely spaced tubes , the images charges from neighboring tubes contribute to this force .    in the next section",
    "we show how these resonances and their main characteristics can be understood from analyzing a two - oscillator array .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : several ] we study , numerically , how the response changes qualitatively as the size of the arrays grow larger .",
    "the parametric resonances , both the transverse and the longitudinal , show a complex behavior with multiple bifurcation points .",
    "these are not shown in the panels of figure  [ fig:100a ] but will be addressed further in section  [ sec : several ] .",
    "in this section we study the simplest case , namely an array consisting of only two cantilevers with identical physical parameters . this case can be analyzed analytically and serves to validate numerical modeling and provides insights for larger arrays .",

    "having treated the two - oscillator system in some detail we now move on to describe how the system response changes with increasing system size . for this",

    "these resonances become successively more complicated and exhibit rich behavior with several overlapping hysteresis loops , bifurcation points etc .",
    "the transverse modes are also responsible for destabilizing the longitudinal modes at high amplitudes and may lead to snap to contact . also , the parametrically excited transverse modes , show regions of irregular behavior coming from coupling between transverse and longitudinal modes .",
    "we have shown , that the features of the response of 1d - arrays can be understood qualitatively through studying the simplest possible array , a two - tube system .",
    "also quantitative predictions based on the two tube system can be used to obtain estimates of regions of instability towards parametric resonances and to estimate frequency tuning .    from a technological point of view",
    ", these estimates can help in designing array resonator systems to avoid unwanted resonances while maintaining a high packing density .",
    "utilizing parametric resonances could also be a path to further increase the operation frequency in technical applications and by tuning the bias voltages the width of the region of instability can be tuned to an arbitrarily narrow frequency domain .",
