    "the microquasar xte j1550 - 564 was discovered with the all sky monitor on board rossixte @xcite in september 1998 @xcite and to date it showed four outbursts .",
    "the compared analysis of all these outbursts allows to relate different behaviours of the source with different values of flux reached during the outburst .",
    "the outburst here analyzed is quite different from the first two and similar to the 2001 one .",
    "radio observations were reported by @xcite .",
    "a more complete analysis is described in @xcite .",
    "we analyzed spectra in a range from 3 to 150 kev from pca @xcite and hexte @xcite instruments corresponding to channels 4 - 52 for the pca and 10 - 50 for hexte .",
    "we used a model consisting of a power law with a high - energy cutoff , a smeared fe edge and a fe emission line .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed at 8.5 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and a systematic error of 0.75% was quadratically added to the data . for the first seven observations the line was not necessary while for the remaining the edge was not required .",
    "the absence of a soft thermal component may be due to the lack of data at energies lower than 3 kev .",
    "the unabsorbed 3 - 150 kev flux decreased from 1.2 @xmath2 10@xmath5 erg @xmath4 s@xmath1 to 7.1 @xmath2 10@xmath6 erg @xmath4 s@xmath1 , corresponding to a luminosity at 6 kpc of 5.0 - 0.2 @xmath2 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the values found for the power law photon index are tipical of a low / hard state .",
    "the cutoff energy decreases substantially during the observations ( from @xmath8340 kev to @xmath864 kev ) while the photon index does not increase much ( from @xmath81.4 to @xmath81.5 ) .",
    "the variability observed in the pca light curve is tipical of the low / hard state . for each observation we created a power density spectrum ( pds ) in the following way : we produced individual leahy - normalized @xcite pds from 512-second stretches with time resolution of 512 s@xmath1 from pca data ranging from channel 0 to 35 ( roughly corresponding to energies from 2 to 15 kev ) .",
    "these pds were averaged and the contribution due to poisson statistic was subtracted @xcite .",
    "the averaged pds were normalized to squared fractional rms @xcite .",
    "each pds was fitted with a model consisting of a sum of lorentzian components @xcite : we always needed only two broad lorentzian to reach good values of the chi - squared . in figure  [ powspe ] all the pds extracted are shown , together with their best fit lorentzian components .",
    "from the analysis of energy spectra we can see how the presence of a high energy cutoff in the power law component is consistent with the presence of a thermal distribution of electrons in the inner region .",
    "in such a model the decrease of the cutoff energy implies a decrease of electron temperature : since the photon index does not change correspondingly the optical depth of the comptonizing cloud must have increased at the same time .    interpreting the two lorentzian components present in the pds as l@xmath9 and l@xmath10 ( see @xcite )",
    ", we can verify how the values found are consistent with existing correlations found in other sources , like the one concerning @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath11 vs. rms@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the timing analysis results confirm that xte j1550 - 564 is in a low / hard state .",
    "the general behaviour showed by xte j1550 - 564 during this outburst is compatible with the one observed in other bhc in their low / hard state , indicating that at lower fluxes ( and therefore possibly lower accretion rates ) the source behaves like `` normal '' bhc .",

    "<S> the observed behaviour is comparable to most black - hole candidates in the low / hard state this is unlike the 1998 - 99 outburst , when it showed a much more complex feature , probably because of the higher luminosity . for each of the 11 observations we extracted energy spectra and power density spectra , finding typical features of a low / hard state . </S>",
