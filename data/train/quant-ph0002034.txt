    "the fundamental obstacle , preventing experimentalists from extending the number of qubits to @xmath1 in an individual molecule of the liquid - state nmr quantum computer , is the difficulty of distinguishing @xmath2 unique set of two - state cells . to remove this obstacle it",
    "was already proposed several models for solid - state quantum computers with both _",
    "individual _ and _ ensemble _ control of qubits .",
    "one of such potentially realizable model based on a one - dimensional cellular automaton , using an one - dimensional periodic array abcabc   of _ three types _ of two - state quantum - mechanical cells ( they may be heteronuclear system of spins @xmath0 ) with distinct resonant frequencies and local interaction between near neighbors , was first considered by s.lloyd @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interaction contains in a shift of the each cell energy levels depending on states of its neighbors .",
    "after using the resonant @xmath3pulse all cells of type a , for instance , invert their state if , and only if , the left neighbor c is in ground state and the b on its right is in excited state . in @xcite , it was represented algorithm , which was applied globally to all cells , so that there is no need to address cells individually .",
    "this model was recently developed by s.lloyd @xcite .",
    "the more general model of a solid state _ ensemble _",
    "nmr quantum computer was described in @xcite , where it was considered periodic structure of abcabcabc ",
    "type in two or three dimensions with the nuclear spins 1/2 _ only of three _ distinguish types a , b , c. it was supposed that the nuclei are embedded in a crystal lattice of some solid state compound with spinless nuclei and all spins are initialized to the ground state @xmath4 .",
    "each abc - unit of this superlattice can be used to store quantum information by setting one of spin up or down .",
    "this information can be moved around via some quantum cellular state shifting mechanism . cascading _",
    "unitary quantum _ swap operations of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 ,    is used for this process .",
    "an ancillary dopand nucleus @xmath8 with spin 1/2 in the proximity of an a - site can serve as the input / output port .",
    "a local environment region near dopand nucleus provides a large quantum system with a wealth of qubits and only three types of nuclear spins .",
    "therefore impurity doping may induce large - scale quantum automata in a single crystal and the whole crystal contains a _ huge ensemble _ of such identical nmr quantum computers  large artificial `` molecules '' .",
    "one - dimensional scheme that was based _ only on two _ different a and b types of cell in a periodic array without the ability to distinguish the left neighbor from the right was described in @xcite .",
    "each two - state cell of the scheme has ground @xmath9 and excited @xmath10 internal eigenstates and can represent any quantum superposition of these states .",
    "all cells are initially in the same ground states @xmath9 and the state of the all array is @xmath11 , similar to an one - dimensional two - sublattice ferromagnetic .",
    "each qubit of quantum information in the state is represented by four consecutive units : the qubit basis state `` 0 '' is represented by unit @xmath12 , whilst the state `` 1 '' is represented by @xmath13 .",
    "the model of array described below could be realized by using a linear artificial `` molecule '' with a and b cells alternating along its length in antiferromagnetic - type structure . as the cells in this array",
    "are used _ only identical _",
    "nuclear spins @xmath0 .",
    "the neighbor nuclear spins in the ground state of antiferromagnetic structure are _ opposite _ orientated and have distinct resonant frequencies determined by hyperfine interaction constant , by applied magnetic field value and by interaction with the left and right nuclear neighbor spins .",
    "the major advantage of this variant over the ferromagnetic structure is that the antiferromagnet does nt have the total spontaneous magnetization and the nuclear resonance frequency does nt depend on the sample shape .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested a bulk - ensemble generalization of the silicon quantum computer model proposed by kane previously @xcite . in ensemble case , unlike the individual kane s model , two - type electrodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 form a set of narrow @xmath17 and long ( several micrometers ) strips . the distance between neighbors",
    "@xmath15 gates was assumed @xmath18 . along the gates @xmath15 ,",
    "donor @xmath19 atoms @xmath20 distant from each other are placed .",
    "if exchange interaction constant for localized electronic spins along the strip gates is more than for electronic spins between neighboring strips and more than zeeman energy @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the induction of the applied magnetic field ) , it produces an artificial one - dimensional _ antiferromagnetically ordered state _ of electronic spins . at the temperatures well below the critical temperature ( neel temperature ) @xmath23 ( @xmath24  the boltzmann constant ) we will have _ a pure macroscopic _ electronic ground quantum state . due to hyperfine",
    "interaction nuclear spins will be oriented according to the electronic spin direction in the resultant field and will form array with the alternating orientation of nuclear spins .",
    "note , this state is not the true pure nuclear antiferromagnetic state so as long as the phases of distinct nuclear spins at macroscopic distances are not correlated at temperature of order or higher then critical temperature of nuclear magnetic dipole ordering , that is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , the phase correlations of near neighbor nuclear spins of course exist .",
    "the nuclear resonant frequencies @xmath26 of neighbor nuclear spins are different for each of the magnetic quasi - one - dimensional subarrays a and b in the chain and depend on the states of neighboring spins",
    ". we will take it in the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath29 is hyperfine interaction constant , ( for @xmath19 : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32  the constant of two neighbor nuclear indirect spin - spin interaction , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the magnetic quantum numbers for the left and right spins . the nonsecular part of interaction is neglected here taking in to account that @xmath35 , @xmath36 .    thus we have the one - dimensional homonuclear periodic array of nuclear spins @xmath0 , formed in the one - dimensional antiferromagnet at the applied magnetic field , owing to hyperfine interaction of nuclear spins with the electronic magnetic moments . at magnetic fields @xmath37 and at temperatures @xmath38 the nuclear spins @xmath19 have in each subarray almost 100% orientation ( 2@xmath39 , that is they are _ in ground _ state .",
    "note , that the using of dynamic methods , such as optical pumping , makes possible the high orientation of nuclear spins also at more large temperatures .",
    "we will estimate here the exchange interaction constant @xmath40 , the critical temperature @xmath41 and the nuclear spin critical temperature , that is due mainly to the suhl - nakamura indirect spin - spin interaction , @xmath42 .    here",
    "we shall use for the organization of logic operations the addressing to spin states and qubits , analogously to consideration @xcite .",
    "we shall consider at first the simple one - dimensional model of the antiferromagnet , in which each cell is represented by the magnetic atom and has one electronic and one nuclear spin 1/2 with hyperfine interaction , similar to the mentioned above artificial molecule of antiferromagnetically ordered donors @xmath43 in silicon substrate .",
    "nuclear spins of identical atoms at @xmath44 are oriented according to the electronic spin direction in the resultant field and will form a periodic ground state array of abab ",
    "type : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 marks the ground state of nuclear spin in an a - site and @xmath47  the ground state of nuclear spin in a b - site , that is we have here _ homonuclear system of spins at two distinct ground states_. each nuclear spin in a - site of this scheme , has _ two _ internal eigenstates  ground @xmath48 and excited @xmath49 and in b - site , accordingly ,  @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we take into account that the life time ( the longitudinal or spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath52 of excited states at low temperatures is very long .",
    "each qubit of quantum information in this state will be represented here , similar to @xcite , by the _",
    "four _ consecutive cells : the logical qubit basis state `` 0 '' will be represented by unit @xmath53 , whilst the state `` 1 ''  by @xmath54 .",
    "it is important here that the resonant frequencies of nuclear spins depend on neighbor spins states .",
    "the input and output of the information in the array of ground states spins could be performed at the ends of the array , where the nuclear spin ( say in a - site at the left end ) has only one neighbor spin and distinguishing resonant frequency @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding selective resonance rf @xmath57pulse inverts only one nuclear spin ( in a - site ) at the end of array and does nt influence on any ones .",
    "then the new selective rf @xmath58pulse will invert next nuclear spin ( in b - site ) , which has the opposite orientation of ground and exited neighbor nuclear spins ( @xmath59 in a - site ) and consequently the new resonant frequency , distinguished from the frequency of spins with the neighbor nuclear spin in ground states @xmath60 .",
    "thus the qubit state `` 0 '' , that is @xmath53 , is formed in the following way ( the pulses act on underlined spins ) : @xmath61    the qubit state `` 1 '' at the edge of array is formed by means of still three pulses : at first @xmath62 , then @xmath63 and @xmath58pulses :    @xmath64 @xmath65    the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 may be called as the reversed states relative to the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "note that a random inversion of only one spin will result in completely destruction of the qubit .",
    "however , to form , for example , the error of `` 0 '' @xmath70 type in the coding of stored quantum information it is essential to invert simultaneously four spins .",
    "therefore , it may be concluded that the considered way of qubit coding ensures a better fault - tolerance with respect to this type of errors .",
    "authors of @xcite have considered also another scheme of the four - spin encoding two logical qubits , which are represented by the two zero - total states of four spins , generated by the pairs respectively of the singlet and triplet states .",
    "this scheme leads in the collective decoherence conditions to the fault - tolerant implementation of quantum computations .",
    "the collective decoherence conditions can be attained in coupled spins at very low temperatures , where all collective but the longest wavelength acoustic phonon modes are quenched .    the further shift - loading of qubit states into the array is implemented by means of pulse sequence @xmath62 , @xmath71 , @xmath62 , @xmath72 , which is represented by following swap operation :    @xmath73 @xmath74 and so on .",
    "the role of the atoms at array ends can play here , as it was discussed in @xcite , also dopand nuclei d at the certain place of the array with distinct resonant frequency or a defect that modifies the resonant frequency of the nearest nuclear spin in the array .",
    "starting from the perfectly initialized states inputting the information can be performed by setting the dopant d - spin to desired state by means of pulse at his resonant frequency .",
    "the nuclear spin state of cell nearest to the dopand is created by swap operation mentioned above . after the required information is loaded , d - spin is reset to the ground state @xmath4 . upon completion of computation",
    ", the state of any qubits can be measured by moving it to the a - site nearest to d , then swapping @xmath75 and finally measuring the state of d - spin .",
    "as in @xcite , we introduce still @xmath76 and @xmath77pulses and operators u@xmath78 and u@xmath79 .",
    "the last means , that each spin in a- and b - site is subjected to a unitary transform u , which acts on spins in a- and b - sites with resonant frequency corresponding to the both neighbor nuclear spin in the _ same excited _ states ( @xmath80 , sign `` @xmath81 '' is for excited neighbor spins in b - sites @xmath51 , and sign `` @xmath82 ''  for a - sites @xmath49 , see table ) .",
    "note , that when operator @xmath83 is a simple inversion , the actions of u@xmath78 and u@xmath79 are identical to @xmath76 and @xmath77pulse .",
    "@xmath84    * table . * the @xmath3pulses for spins in a- and b - sites    @xmath85    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath85    @xmath84    let us construct now the logical gates of quantum computer .",
    "at first we shall investigate at first the scheme for one - qubit gate .",
    "the considered section of the array ( fig .",
    "1 ) contains three qubits in states `` 1 '' , `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , each being separated by number multiple four of spacer cells -nuclear spins in ground state .",
    "therefore each qubit requires a total of eight physical spins in the array ( four for the encoding plus four spacers ) ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "as it was made in @xcite , we will also introduce here _ one control unit _ , ( not to be confused with _",
    "control qubit _ in case of cnot gates ) , which is represented here by _ six _ consecutive cells in the pattern @xmath86 .",
    "the control unit ( cu ) exists only in one place along the array and is separated by odd number of spacer cells  spins ( the scheme at fig .",
    "1 has three ) .",
    "@xmath84    fig .  1 . the scheme of the swap update pulse sequence .",
    "@xmath84    the applying swap update sequence of pulses @xmath62 , @xmath71 , @xmath62 , @xmath71 , @xmath87 moves the qubits to the right and cu to the left relative to the qubits , yet the form of the qubits and the cu are _ preserved . _",
    "the cu passes through qubit in state `` 1 '' and `` 0 '' , leaving it unchanged and continues further ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "to implement the one - qubit logical gate the additional computing updates six pulse sequence @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath88 , @xmath90 , u@xmath78 is applied when cu reaches the mid - way through passing the qubit @xmath91 ( `` 1 '' or `` 0 '' , marked * and * * at fig .  1 ) .",
    "the effect of the additional sequence is to apply a unitary transform @xmath83 only to the spin representing the qubit @xmath91 : @xmath92 ( fig .  2 ) .",

    "we will have in the result the superposition of states : @xmath95    the cu and additional computing updates pulse sequence together ensure the computing operations with qubits .",
    "note , such one - qubit gate requires seventeen elementary pulses .",

    "now the cu itself is subject to a transformation : it is altered from @xmath86 to @xmath96 ( only for passing the qubit `` 0 '' ! ) and qubit `` 0 '' itself will be destroyed ( fig .",
