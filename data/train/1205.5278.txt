    "according to conventional wisdom a quasiparticle is presumed well - defined until proven not to be . the textbook picture of magnons as long - lived excitations weakly interacting with each other works very well for many magnetic materials .",
    "nevertheless , in a number of recently studied spin systems magnons neither interact weakly nor remain well - defined even at zero temperature .",
    "this is due to the so - called spontaneous quasiparticle decay , a spectacular quantum - mechanical many - body effect , which is the topic of the current colloquium .",
    "magnetic excitations have been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies since the first half of the last century .",
    "historically , the concept of spin waves was introduced by @xcite and , independently , by @xcite for the wavelike propagation of spin flips in ordered ferromagnets ; see also @xcite . already in his earliest work",
    "@xcite described spin waves as weakly interacting excitations obeying bose statistics .",
    "subsequently , @xcite introduced second quantization of spin waves in terms of bosonic operators , the approach widely used to this day .",
    "the first use of the word `` magnon , '' which concisely unifies the notions of an elementary quasiparticle and a magnetic quantum , can be traced back to @xcite , who ascribed this term to lev landau , see @xcite . although the terms `` spin waves '' and `` magnons '' are sometimes used to distinguish between long- and short - wavelength excitations , respectively , in the following we use both names interchangeably .",
    "in addition , the fundamental contribution to the theory of spin waves in magnetic insulators was made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these and subsequent studies developed a comprehensive picture of spin waves in conventional quantum ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , which can be found in various reviews and books , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . invented in the 1950s , inelastic neutron - scattering spectroscopy @xcite has quickly become a major experimental method of investigating spin waves and other magnetic excitations in solids . with a variety of specialized techniques currently used at numerous neutron facilities around the world",
    ", it remains the most powerful and versatile research tool for studies of magnetic spectra .",
    "other microscopic techniques to investigate excitations in magnetic materials are electron spin resonance @xcite and light scattering methods , such as resonant inelastic x - ray scattering @xcite .    usually , the magnon - magnon interactions play a minor role at low temperatures .",
    "for example , as @xmath1 deviation of the spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnet from its saturated value follows bloch s law @xmath2 , the result obtained by considering magnons as noninteracting bosons .",
    "interactions yield a correction to bloch s law that scales as @xmath3 , which is still smaller than the `` kinematic '' correction proportional to @xmath4 due to deviation of magnon dispersion from its parabolic form @xcite . in antiferromagnets ,",
    "effects of magnon - magnon interaction survive at zero temperature due to zero - point motion in the ground state .",
    "an estimate of their role is given by the magnitude of the quantum correction to the magnon dispersion law obtained in the harmonic , or semiclassical , approximation .",
    "even in low dimension ( 2d ) and even in the `` extreme quantum '' case of @xmath5 , such a correction for the square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet amounts to a mere @xmath6%  rescaling of the harmonic dispersion @xcite .    recently , there has been a growing body of theoretical and experimental studies showing that the conventional picture of magnons as weakly interacting quasiparticles is not always correct . the first class of systems exhibiting significant deviations from the conventional semiclassical dynamics is weakly coupled antiferromagnetic chains , for which the spin - wave approximation is not a good starting point .",
    "their high - energy spectra are well - described by propagating one - dimensional spinons , the natural basis for excitations in spin-@xmath7 chains @xcite .",
    "since the development of a quantitative theory for the 1d to 3d crossover in weakly coupled chains is still in progress , we shall not discuss this physics here .",
    "the second class is , in a sense , simpler and more puzzling at the same time .",
    "it is comprised of quantum magnets with well - ordered ground states whose dynamical properties are yet quite different from the predictions of harmonic spin - wave theory @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we focus on this second class of unconventional magnetic systems .",
    "it includes quantum magnets with noncollinear spin ordering .",
    "the key role in their unusual dynamical properties is played by cubic anharmonicities , or three - magnon processes , which originate from the noncollinearity of spins .",
    "three - magnon processes are absent in conventional collinear antiferromagnets , making their spin - wave excitations intrinsically weakly interacting .",
    "the most striking effect of three - magnon interactions is the finite lifetime of spin waves : not only at nonzero temperatures when magnon linewidth is determined by scattering off thermal excitations , but also at @xmath8 when damping is produced by _ spontaneous _ magnon decay .    in order to put the phenomenon of spontaneous",
    "magnon decays in a broader context , we note that two other subfields of condensed matter physics also deal with decays of bosonic excitations .",
    "these are anharmonic crystals @xcite and superfluid liquids and gases @xcite .",
    "cubic anharmonicities are naturally present in these systems , but their role differs both quantitatively and qualitatively from that in quantum spin systems . in crystals ,",
    "the anharmonic corrections are generally small due to small mean fluctuations of ions around equilibrium positions , the condition satisfied for the majority of solids below the debye temperature . in superfluids ,",
    "the strength of cubic interactions is determined by the condensate fraction and may again become small , as is the case of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "quantum magnets are unique in that ( i ) cubic anharmonicities may be tuned on and off by an external magnetic field or by changing the lattice geometry , and ( ii ) the existing variety of magnetic compounds provides diverse forms of the magnon dispersion law @xmath9 , which plays key role in spontaneous quasiparticle decay . still , various parallels and analogies between the three branches of condensed matter physics prove to be helpful and will be extensively used in the subsequent discussion .    the rest of the article is organized as follows .",

    "in the classical picture , the interaction between magnons is related to the amplitude of spin precession and can become arbitrarily small as the amplitude decreases .",
    "zero - point motion of spins puts a lower bound on the amplitude and leads to non - negligible interaction effects in quantum magnets .",

    "instead , we discuss the general structure of effective bosonic hamiltonians defined solely by the symmetry of the magnetic ground state and corresponding excitations .",
    "to draw an analogy between different bosonic systems we begin with the hamiltonian of a normal bose gas @xmath10 where @xmath9 is the kinetic energy , @xmath11 is the two - particle scattering amplitude , the ellipsis stands for @xmath12-particle interactions , and momentum conservation is assumed from now on for various @xmath13-summations . the interaction term in eq .",

    "( [ hfm ] ) describes the quantum heisenberg ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "although the number of quasiparticles may not be conserved , in a ferromagnet the conservation is enforced by the invariance of the ground state under an arbitrary rotation about the magnetization direction .",
    "because of this symmetry the ground state and all excitations are characterized by definite values of the @xmath14-projection of the total spin @xmath15 , from @xmath16 and down .",
    "consequently , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian vanish for states with different spin projections , resulting in the particlelike form of the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ hfm ] ) . in other words ,",
    "in the heisenberg ferromagnet every magnon has an intrinsic quantum number @xmath17 , which is conserved in magnon scattering processes .",
    "the quasiparticle - number conservation does not hold for interaction processes in quantum antiferromagnets . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the symmetry - broken antiferromagnetic ground state corresponds to a superposition of states with different values of the total spin .",
    "hence , elementary excitations can not be assigned with a definite value of spin : the spin of the spin wave ceases to exist . because of that , the effective hamiltonian of a quantum antiferromagnet contains additional interaction terms , @xmath18 that do not conserve the number of excitations ; see , for example , @xcite . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ haf ] ) describes decay and recombination processes of one magnon into three and vice versa , whereas the second , so - called source term , corresponds to creation and annihilation of four particles out of ( into ) an antiferromagnetic vacuum .",

    "are present , beginning with the lowest - order cubic terms , which couple one- and two - particle states .",
    "for instance , cubic terms represent the dominant anharmonicity for lattice vibrations @xcite",
    ". however , additional symmetry restrictions may forbid such cubic interactions in antiferromagnets .",
    "in the case of a collinear antiferromagnet , the remaining so(2 ) rotational symmetry about the nel vector direction ( @xmath14 axis ) prohibits cubic terms .",
    "although the single - magnon state is not an eigenstate of the @xmath19 operator , such a state still preserves an odd parity under the @xmath20 rotation about the @xmath14 axis .",
    "in contrast , the two - magnon states are invariant under this symmetry operation .",
    "consequently , the coupling between one- and two - particle sectors is strictly forbidden in collinear antiferromagnets and cubic terms do not occur in their effective bosonic description . in hindsight , this lack of low - degree anharmonicities explains why the spin - wave theory works quantitatively well even for spin-@xmath21 systems : magnets with collinear spin structures have excitations that are intrinsically weakly - interacting .    on the other hand",
    ", three - magnon interaction terms must be present if the spin - rotational symmetry is completely broken in the ground state , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the magnetic structure becomes noncollinear .",
    "this is realized , for example , due to spin canting in an applied magnetic field or because of competing interactions in frustrated antiferromagnets .",
    "the general form of the three - boson interaction is given by @xmath22 where the first term describes the two - particle decay and recombination processes while the second is another source term .",
    "there exists a deep analogy between the noncollinear quantum magnets and superfluid boson systems regarding the presence of cubic interactions in their effective hamiltonians .",
    "the bose gas in the normal state is invariant under the group of gauge transformations u(1 ) and is described by the hamiltonian ( [ hfm ] ) .",
    "the macroscopic occupation of the lowest - energy state @xmath23 below the superfluid transition leads to breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry and , at the same time , to the appearance of the cubic terms by virtue of the bogolyubov substitution @xmath24 in other words , the vacuum state with the bose condensate absorbs or emits an extra particle , enabling nonconserving processes between excitations .    an analogous consideration of the noncollinear magnetically ordered state is possible , leading to the same qualitative answer .",
    "in fact , it was realized a long time ago by @xcite and by @xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between breaking the so(2 ) rotational invariance about the field direction for heisenberg and planar magnets and breaking the u(1 ) gauge symmetry at the superfluid transition .",
    "noncollinear magnetic structures stabilized by competing exchange interactions in zero field belong to a different class as they spontaneously break the full so(3 ) rotational symmetry without the help of an external field .",
    "still , the absence of any remaining symmetry constraints for their elementary excitations , apart from energy and momentum conservation , permits all possible anharmonic terms including the cubic ones .",
    "it is necessary to mention that cubic anharmonicities due to the long - range dipolar interactions have been discussed already in the early works on the quantum theory of spin waves in ferromagnets @xcite where they play an important role in the low - frequency magnetization dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of cubic terms is completely negligible at higher energies because of the smallness of the dipole - dipole interaction compared to the exchange energy .",
    "in contrast , cubic anharmonicities discussed in this work are of exchange origin and have a profound effect on the magnon excitation spectra .",
    "anharmonic interactions are not restricted to cubic and quartic processes .",
    "the usual spin - wave expansion based on the holstein - primakoff transformation for spin operators produces an infinite series of interaction terms .",
    "typically , these higher - orders terms are small due to the spin - wave expansion parameter @xmath25 associated with each order of expansion .",
    "we disregard them in the following analysis as they do not alter our results , either qualitatively or quantitatively .",

    "sec : field_decays ] and [ sec : tafm ] , which requires detailed consideration of the spectrum near the decay boundary .",
    "as shown next , the presence of nonanalytic self - energy leads to dramatic qualitative changes of the magnon spectrum near the threshold .    according to the preceding discussion , the three - magnon interaction has the form @xmath364 although due to conservation of the total spin the magnon with polarization @xmath365 can decay only into magnons with different polarizations , as enforced by the antisymmetric tensor @xmath44 , this has no implications for the decays as long as the three branches remain degenerate .",
    "more important is the antisymmetric structure of the magnon vertex under the permutation of polarizations @xmath41 and @xmath320 and , consequently , under the interchange of momenta of the decay products @xmath366 .",
    "since at the decay boundary the emitted magnons have equal momenta , the three - magnon vertex ( [ decayv ] ) vanishes at the threshold @xmath367 . then the main difference from the analysis of the decay singularities in sec .  [",

    "our final example of spontaneous magnon decays concerns weakly - ordered collinear antiferromagnets , which occupy an intermediate place between quantum - disordered and well - ordered semiclassical magnets .",
    "apart from the conventional spin waves , excitation spectrum of the weakly - ordered spin system may display a longitudinal mode that corresponds to fluctuations of the magnitude of the order parameter @xcite .",

    "one may ask how the above scenario could at all agree with the conventional spin - wave picture , which accounts only for the two magnon modes .",
    "the apparent contradiction is resolved if we notice that the longitudinal mode is always unstable with respect to decay into a pair of transverse spin waves and thus has an intrinsic linewidth @xcite . farther inside the parameter domain of the ordered phase ,",

    "the pressure - induced quantum critical point is realized , for instance , in the spin - dimer antiferromagnet @xmath416 @xcite . the low critical pressure @xmath417  kbar enables the use of inelastic neutron measurements to explore the phases on both sides of the critical point .",
    "the existence of the gapped longitudinal mode in the antiferromagnetic phase of @xmath416 was demonstrated by @xcite , who concluded that such a mode is `` critically well defined '' because of its large broadening .",

    "we describe basic aspects of spontaneous magnon decays in weakly ordered collinear antiferromagnets using the example of @xmath416 .",

    "the degeneracy of the triplon bands is removed in the ordered phase .",

    "although the cubic vertex ( [ decayv ] ) may be absent in the disordered state at @xmath425 , the triplet condensation in the ordered phase always produces a three - particle interaction involving longitudinal fluctuations ; see eq .",
    "( [ condensate ] ) : @xmath426 .",
    "thus , the symmetry ensures that the longitudinal magnon can decay into a pair of transverse magnons @xmath427 .",

    "while no exhaustive list of magnets that favor quasiparticle decays can be given , the offered examples outline the principal classes of spin systems , in which the effect may occur .",
    "generally , the noncollinear spin structures in the systems where the symmetry is broken spontaneously from the high - symmetry spin hamiltonian belong to one of such classes .",
    "the gapped quantum spin liquids is yet another class and a proximity to a quantum critical point can be another common situation in which magnetic excitations may be intrinsically damped .",
    "the hallmarks of the decay - induced anomalies in magnon spectra include substantial broadening of magnon peaks in a large part of the brillouin zone , termination points , and non - lorentzian features in the structure factor , as well as strong deviations of the spectrum from the harmonic theory , especially for @xmath5 systems .",
