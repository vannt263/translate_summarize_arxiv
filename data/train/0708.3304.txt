    "decoherence of quantum states has been attracting much attention for long years @xcite .",
    "many methods have been proposed for defeating the decoherence .",
    "as compared with other methods @xcite , quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite has a great advantage of protecting against arbitrary errors if they only affect a single qubit ( two - level system ) in each _ logical _ qubit @xcite .",
    "although qec has been developed in the context of quantum computation , it is interesting and useful to apply qec to protection of the unitary time evolution ( hamiltonian evolution ) against noise .",
    "when trying to realize this , however , one encounters many physical problems , which are usually disregarded in discussions on the computational complexity @xcite .",
    "for example , some physical process may be much more difficult to realize than another , even if the number of the necessary steps for them differs ` only by polynomial steps ' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fabrication of a controlled - not gate , which is one of the elementary quantum gates , is very difficult because it requires fine tuning of the coupling constants of the interactions and high - precision switching of them , even if one employs the excellent ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite . assembling a quantum circuit from the elementary gates is even more difficult , particularly when the circuit is large and complicated .",
    "unfortunately , the circuit indeed becomes large and complicated when one tries to apply qec to the hamiltonian evolution , even for the simplest case such as the rabi oscillation @xcite .",
    "the largest and most complicated part of the circuit is the one that induces the encoded hamiltonian evolution ( such as the rabi oscillation of a logical qubit ) _ in a fault - tolerant manner _",
    "although a non - fault - tolerant circuit can be much simpler , such a circuit is too fragile to errors .",
    "it is therefore important to explore new methods , which are physically more feasible and natural , for inducing the encoded hamiltonian evolution and thereby making qec applicable .    in this paper , we propose such a new method , choosing the rabi oscillation as the hamiltonian evolution to be protected .",
    "the method utilizes effective interactions that arise naturally among physical qubits .",
    "we show that the values of the parameters in the interactions are to a great extent arbitrary .",
    "furthermore , switching of the interactions is unnecessary .",
    "therefore , a system of a logical qubit with such interactions can be prepared easily by placing several two - level systems close to each other .",
    "once such a system is prepared , it is driven spontaneously and flawlessly by the schrdinger equation .",
    "this is much easier than to drive the system by a fault - tolerant quantum circuit . on the other hand ,",
    "we argue physically that it is highly probable that unwanted interactions should also exist in such a system . while some of them are shown to be irrelevant , the others invalidate straightforward application of qec . as a resolution we present a protocol , which we call the error - correction sequence .",
    "one can realize the protected rabi oscillation by using the natural interactions ( to induce the logical rabi oscillation ) and a quantum circuit for the error - correction sequence .",
    "this is much easier than realizing it wholly with a quantum circuit , because a fault - tolerant quantum circuit for inducing the logical rabi oscillation , which is the largest and most complicated part of the full circuit , is unnecessary .",
    "we employ a two - level system as a basic element , which we call a qubit or _ physical _ qubit . we represent operators acting on a qubit in terms of the pauli operators @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) , which are not necessarily those for a physical spin .",
    "to apply qec to the rabi oscillation , @xmath2 we replace a single qubit with a _",
    "logical _ qubit which is composed of several qubits .",
    "the basis states @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 eigenstate of @xmath6 , respectively ) of a qubit correspond to @xmath7 of a logical qubit .",
    "the subspace ( of the logical qubit ) that is spanned by the latter is called the code space . for the reasons that will be described in sec.[sec : dandc ] ,",
    "we here take the shor code @xcite , in which a logical qubit is composed of nine qubits and @xmath8    we have to induce the _",
    "logical _ rabi oscillation ; @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a logical pauli operator ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , it can be induced if the hamiltonian is @xmath13 .",
    "[ here and after , we take @xmath14 . ]",
    "this is an interaction among three or more qubits , for any code that can correct all single - qubit errors ( appendix [ app:3 or more ] ) .",
    "for the shor code , @xmath10 can be represented in various ways , e.g. , as @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 acts on qubit @xmath18 . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath19    suppose that nine qubits ( such as atoms , quantum dots , and so on ) composing a logical qubit are placed close to each other as shown in fig .  [ qubits configuration ] . then , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : effectiveh ] , a three - qubit interaction proportional to @xmath10 ( @xmath20 ) would be generated as an effective interaction .",
    "[ similar three - qubit interactions were also discussed in refs .",
    "unfortunately , however , if this interaction is strong enough unwanted two - qubit interactions proportional to @xmath21 should also be strong , because otherwise the following unphysical conclusion would be drawn ; if one of qubits @xmath22 is removed the other two qubits would have no interactions .",
    "furthermore , interactions between other pairs of qubits , such as @xmath23 , would also exist in general .",

    "furthermore , since three - qubit interactions are generally weaker than two - qubit interactions ( see sec .  [",

    "using this fact , we will show later by explicit calculations that the values of @xmath29 s are irrelevant . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - qubit interactions in @xmath38 are not elements of the stabilizer , and hence drive the state out of the code space .",
    "nevertheless , we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : kk ] that the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 s are fairly arbitrary as long as @xmath39 .",

    "therefore , the values ( including signs ) of all the parameters in @xmath40 ( hence the distances between the qubits ) are to a great extent arbitrary .",
    "this makes our scheme robust to fabrication errors .",
    "once the system is thus fabricated , the law of the nature drives it flawlessly if noise is absent .",

    "we note that all terms in @xmath40 commute with each other , and that @xmath44 does not change @xmath43 because all terms in @xmath35 are elements of the stabilizer . using these facts and the relations @xmath45 , we find @xmath46 when @xmath47 , this state is out of the code space because of the last term .",
    "therefore , we can not perform qec for phase errors at an arbitrary time , because the syndrome measurement @xcite to identify the errors misidentifies the last term as a wrong term generated by a phase - flip noise ; if qec for phase errors were performed with some intervals @xmath48 the time evolution would be affected as shown in fig .",

    "one can also make @xmath236 larger by modulating spatially the magnitude of the external magnetic field .",
    "if condition ( [ eq : xi = small ] ) is satisfied by these methods , one can drop non - diagonal terms , and hence @xmath206 reduces to @xmath40 , which consists only of @xmath238 s , when considering the time evolution .    on the conditions and assumptions mentioned above , @xmath40",
    "can be derived simply by taking the diagonal matrix elements , between @xmath239 s , of the effective hamiltonian for conduction electrons , @xmath240 where @xmath241 denotes the non - interacting part , which includes the confining potential of the dots .",
    "we here present explicit results for the three qubits in the central triangle of fig .",

    "overlap of the wavefunctions of different dots is negligibly small , i.e. , @xmath246 for @xmath247 and for all @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) . using this fact , we find that the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath250 where , for @xmath251 , @xmath252 and similarly for the other @xmath253 s and @xmath254 s . here , @xmath255 is the energy difference between @xmath256 and @xmath257 , and @xmath258 and similarly for @xmath259 .",
    "in fact , one can easily verify that all the diagonal matrix elements of eq.([h3:org ] ) , between @xmath239 s , agree with those of eq.([h3:eff ] ) .",

    "generally , if @xmath261 qubits are crowded to induce an @xmath261-qubit interaction corresponding to @xmath10 , unwanted interactions among @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) qubits are also induced , as we have discussed on @xmath40 . for any code that can correct all single - qubit errors ,",

    "we have also shown that the values of @xmath29 s in @xmath44 are arbitrary .",
    "such great flexibility would not be obtained if we employed a non - degenerate code @xcite , because its stabilizer does not include two - fold tensor products of the pauli operators .",
    "for example , the steane code is a non - degenerate code and hence it has less flexibility . for these reasons ,",
    "we have employed in this paper the shor code , which is a degenerate code with @xmath270 ( because we can take @xmath271 ) and @xmath272 .",

    "a possible way of realizing this may be mixed use of an hamiltonian ( such as the one of this paper ) and simple quantum circuits .",

    "[ discrete rabi oscillation ] .",
    "we call it the discrete logical rabi oscillation ( sec .",

    "[ qubits configuration ] .",
    "the parameters of this system , such as the positions and the sizes of the dots , are to a great extent arbitrary because the proposed hamiltonian has great flexibility ( secs .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] and [ sec : kk ] ) .",
    "this makes the fabrication of the system easier .",
    "once the fabrication is finished , one can measure the coupling constants of the effective interactions , and the important parameters such as @xmath55 can be calculated from them . to protect the discrete logical rabi oscillation against noise",
    ", the ordinary qec can not be applied straightforwardly .",
    "however , we have shown that it can be protected by a new protocol , which we call the error - correction sequence ( secs .",
    "[ sec : concepts ] and [ sec : calculations ] ) . in this protocol ,",
    "qec for both phase and bit - flip errors is performed at @xmath66 s , whereas qec only for bit - flip errors is performed frequently in the interval between @xmath77 and @xmath66 for all @xmath79 .",
    "the frequency of the latter is determined by the strength of noise and the parameters of the effective interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : calculations ] ) .",
    "one can realize the protected rabi oscillation by using the natural hamiltonian ( to induce the logical rabi oscillation ) and a quantum circuit for the error - correction sequence .",
    "this is much easier than realizing it wholly with a fault - tolerant quantum circuit .",

    "( [ eq : pc ] ) is not satisfied for any value of @xmath286 .",
    "this means that such a code can not correct all single - qubit errors .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 is a three- or more - fold tensor product of the pauli operators ( which corresponds to an interaction among three or more qubits ) for any code that can correct all single - qubit errors .",
    "when two levels of a qubit have different energies , a single - qubit term , which represents the energy difference , arises in its effective hamiltonian as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : effectiveh ] .",
    "all effects of such single - qubit terms can be canceled if we do everything in the rotating frame @xcite .",
    "although this fact seems to be known widely , we here explain it in order to clarify its meaning in the context of qec .",
    "let us investigate the time evolution of a state @xmath287 by the following hamiltonian @xmath288 where @xmath289 s are real numbers .",
    "we can go to the rotating frame ( an interaction picture ) by @xmath290 , as @xmath291 .",
    "it evolves according to @xmath292=[h,\\rho^{\\text{rot}}],\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath293=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath294 undergoes the same unitary evolution as that of @xmath90 of sec .",
    "[ sec : calculations ] .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that the depolarizing channel in the rotating frame is also the same as the one in sec .  [",
    "sec : calculations ] .",
    "thus , in the presence of noise , @xmath294 evolves in the same manner as @xmath90 of sec .",
    "[ sec : calculations ] .",
    "therefore , the error correction sequence will be successful if we set the initial state @xmath295 in the code space and perform qec in the rotating frame .",
    "for example , the observables for the syndrome measurement in the rotating frame are @xmath296 , @xmath297 , and so on . in the laboratory frame ( schrdinger picture ) , they are given by @xmath298 and @xmath299 , respectively .",
    "it seems widely accepted by researchers of nmr that the non - diagonal terms , which include @xmath164 s and/or @xmath165 s , in @xmath206 are irrelevant to the time evolution if condition ( [ eq : xi = small ] ) is satisfied ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . for completeness",
    ", we here show that this is indeed true under reasonable assumptions .",
    "let us decompose @xmath206 as @xmath301 where @xmath289 is the energy difference ( that is renormalized , like eq .  ( [ eq : zeta ] ) , by interections among dots ) between @xmath227 and @xmath302 , @xmath40 is a polynomial of @xmath17 s only , and @xmath303 consists of the other terms ( such as @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and so on ) which include @xmath164 s and/or @xmath165 s .",
    "we denote a product state of @xmath227 s and @xmath226 s , such as @xmath306 , by @xmath307 . in terms of such product states ,",
    "@xmath308 and @xmath40 are diagonal , whereas @xmath303 gives the off - diagonal elements . to characterize the magnitude of the latter , we define the parameter @xmath309 by @xmath310 where @xmath230 denotes the difference of the eigenvalues of @xmath308 between @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "we also define @xmath311    consider the time evolution operator @xmath312 generated by @xmath206 .",
    "we can write it as @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath315 is the hermitian operator defined by @xmath316 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath317 if @xmath318 were large then @xmath315 would be significant , particularly when @xmath319 for all @xmath320 , for which @xmath321 . on the other hand , if @xmath318 is small enough @xmath322 is expected to be small , where @xmath323 denotes the operator norm .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath324 this assumption seems reasonable from the perturbation expansion of the time evolution operator in the interaction picture , which corresponds to @xmath325 ; @xmath326 each term of which is continuous with respect to @xmath309 .",
    "assumption 1 , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : q=0 ] ) , means that for any small positive number @xmath327 there exists a positive number @xmath328 such that @xmath329 in other words , for a given time period @xmath330 we can neglect @xmath315 , i.e. , we can regard @xmath331 , if @xmath318 is small enough .",
    "this means that the time evolution by @xmath206 takes place as if @xmath224 s ( which are eigenstates of @xmath332 ) were its eigenstates .",

    "for example , the argument in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite , where specific forms have been assumed , is essentially a special case of the present general argument .    in the above argument",
    ", we have not excluded the possibility that @xmath328 increases with increasing @xmath101 .",
