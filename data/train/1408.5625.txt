    "of particular interest here is the example of case ( 3 ) , the `` evil eye '' galaxy ngc 4826 in which the direction of rotation of the gas reverses going from the inner ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) to the outer disc ( @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ) with an inward radial accretion speed of more than @xmath4 km s@xmath2 in the transition zone , whereas the stars at all radii rotate in the same direction as the gas in the inner disc , which has a radius of @xmath5 pc ( braun et al . 1994 ; rubin 1994b ) .    on a stellar mass scale , remijan and hollis ( 2006 ) and tang et al .",

    "that is , the instability is essentially a three - dimensional instability .",

    "counter - rotating keplerian discs are unstable for azimuthal mode numbers @xmath140 , whereas for a flat rotation curve relevant to disc galaxies the unstable mode numbers are @xmath181 .",
    "we note that when there is a density change across the interface there is necessarily a corresponding change in the entropy .",
    "this changes the jump condition across the interface and leads in general to propagating unstable modes where @xmath113 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the important new term in the jump condition comes from the term @xmath184 on the right - hand side of equation ( 17 ) .",
    "the nonlinear phase of the instability will involve the mixing of co- and counter - rotating gas which will involve strong shocks , strong heating of the gas , and annihilation of the angular momenta of the two gas components .",
    "the heated gas will expand vertically and since it has zero angular momentum it will free - fall to the disc s center over the surface of the inner disc .",
    "thus the region between the co- and counter - rotating components will be rapidly emptied of gas and a gap will form . in effect the two components have a repulsive interaction .",
    "this is suggestive of the leidenfrost effect ( leidenfrost 1966 ) where a liquid droplet is levitated above a hot surface by the vapor pressure between the droplet and the surface .",
    "subsequent to the gap formation , the outer disc will spread inward and the inner disc outward due to the turbulent viscosity .",
    "consequently the gap will close after a definite period and the heating and annihilation of angular momentum will repeat .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are of course required to fully understand the nonlinear evolution of the counter - rotating discs .",
