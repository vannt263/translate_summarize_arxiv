    "variations in the vacuum structure of a quantum field give rise to what is commonly know as the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "it its simplest form it manifests itself as a net force between neutral objects @xcite .",
    "any attempt at computing the casimir energy and force for almost all geometric configurations of neutral objects necessarily leads to divergences that need to be regularized through the use of appropriate formal methods @xcite .",
    "a particular example of a configuration for which the casimir force is , generally , well defined is provided by the so - called casimir piston .",
    "the most general casimir piston can be described as consisting of two compact manifolds having a common boundary which is referred to as the piston .",
    "casimir piston configurations were first introduced in @xcite , and since then they have been the subject of intense research ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for such popularity lies in the fact that while the casimir energy might present divergences , the corresponding casimir force on the piston is well defined .",
    "it is important to point out , however , that this does not hold , in general , when the piston configuration has a non vanishing curvature @xcite .",
    "most of the research that has been performed on the casimir effect for piston configurations has been focused almost excursively on  idealized \" cases .",
    "these are cases characterized by dirichlet , neumann or hybrid ( mixed ) boundary conditions imposed at the boundary of the piston configuration , and on the piston itself . moreover , in idealized cases , the piston is always assumed to be infinitely thin .",
    "it is not very difficult to realize that the results obtained for the casimir energy and force in idealized cases are unsuitable for the description of piston configurations consisting of real materials for two main reasons : 1 ) physical properties of real materials might not be appropriately described by any of the ideal boundary conditions ( dirichlet , neumann or hybrid ) and , 2 ) real materials do have a finite thickness .",
    "an attempt at addressing the first problem can be found for instance in @xcite where the casimir effect is studied for a piston configuration endowed with general boundary conditions .",
    "a different approach was undertaken in @xcite where the ideal boundary conditions were replaced by a suitable potential function which would better describe the physical properties of real materials .",
    "the casimir effect for materials of finite thickness , instead , has been analyzed within the framework of piston configurations for instance in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to provide a more comprehensive study of the casimir effect for piston configurations in which we consider general boundary conditions and a piston of finite thickness .",
    "it is worth noting that in this approach the boundary conditions imposed on one side of the thick piston are allowed to be independent of the boundary conditions imposed on the other side .",
    "this specific setup could be very useful in describing pistons consisting of certain anisotropic materials ( those for which the anisotropy occurs along the thickness of the piston ) .",
    "in this paper we will use the spectral zeta function regularization technique in order to analyze the casimir energy and force associated with a thick piston .",
    "the spectral zeta function , @xmath0 , of the problem under consideration can be used to find the casimir energy according to the formula @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 representing a parameter with the dimensions of a mass .",
    "due to the fact that the spectral zeta function generally develops a simple pole at the point @xmath3 @xcite , the casimir energy presents divergences which are easily shown in the formula @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 denoting , respectively , the finite part and the residue .",
    "it is clear , from the previous expression , that the casimir energy becomes a well defined quantity when the residue of the spectral zeta function at @xmath3 vanishes . in the case of piston configurations ,",
    "the casimir energy depends explicitly on the position of the piston @xmath7 , and the corresponding casimir force is obtained as follows @xmath8 in order to get a casimir force on the piston devoid of meaningless divergences the residue of the zeta function appearing in ( [ 0a ] ) has to be independent of the position of the piston @xmath7 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe in details the thick piston configuration and obtain the associated spectral zeta function . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we perform the analytic continuation of the spectral zeta function and obtain an explicit expression for the casimir energy of the form indicated in ( [ 0a ] ) .",
    "plots describing how the casimir force on a thick piston varies with respect to the position of the piston itself and its thickness are provided in section [ sec4 ] for several specific examples of boundary conditions .",
    "the conclusions summarize our main results and point out further directions of research .",
    "in order to describe the geometric configuration associated with a thick piston we consider a @xmath9-dimensional product manifold of the type @xmath10\\times n$ ] where @xmath11\\subset \\mathbb{r}$ ] and @xmath12 is a @xmath13-dimensional compact riemannian manifold with or without boundary .",
    "let @xmath7 denote an arbitrary point in the interval @xmath14 , and let @xmath15 .",
    "we then define the manifolds @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be the cross - sections of @xmath18 at the point @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the cross - sections constructed above naturally divide the manifold @xmath18 in three regions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the regions @xmath24 and @xmath25\\times m$ ] will be referred to as the left , respectively right , chamber of the piston configuration while the region @xmath26\\times m$ ] will describe the piston itself of thickness @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that in order to have a proper piston configuration we need to assume that @xmath28 .",
    "it is not very difficult to realize that in the limit @xmath29 the thick piston outlined above reduces to the familiar infinitely thin casimir piston with a general cross - section ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on a massless scalar field confined on the piston @xmath18 .",
    "the propagation of the scalar field in each region of the piston configuration is described by the following differential equation @xmath30 with @xmath31 representing the laplace operator on the base manifold @xmath12 and @xmath32 . by using separation of variables the general solution to ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as a product @xmath33 where the function @xmath34 solves the equation @xmath35 while the functions @xmath36 are solutions to the second - order differential equation @xmath37 the spectral zeta function needed for the analysis of the casimir energy associated with the thick piston configuration is written as the sum @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the spectral zeta function of region @xmath40 and is defined as @xmath41 it is well known @xcite , from the general theory of spectral zeta function , that @xmath39 in ( [ 4 ] ) , and consequently @xmath0 in ( [ 3 ] ) , are analytic functions in the region of the complex plane @xmath42 .    as we have already mentioned earlier , in order to obtain the casimir energy for our piston configuration we need to analyze the behavior of the zeta function in the neighborhood of the point @xmath3 .",
    "this point , however , lies outside of the region of convergence @xmath42 .",
    "this last remark implies that it is necessary to perform the analytic continuation of @xmath0 to the region @xmath43 containing @xmath3 . to perform the desired analytic continuation we utilize a suitable integral representation of the zeta functions @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of this representation is a function which provides an implicit equation for the eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "such function can be easily found by making use of the boundary conditions .",
    "here we will impose , on the differential equation ( [ 2 ] ) , general separated boundary conditions that lead to a self - adjoint boundary value problem @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are of the form @xcite @xmath45 in region @xmath46 , @xmath47 in region @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in region @xmath50 where @xmath51 satisfying the conditions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .    in all three regions",
    "the general solution of the differential equation ( [ 2 ] ) is of the form @xmath56 where we have used the notation @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "now , we choose the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 so that the boundary condition at the left boundary in each region is automatically satisfied . in doing so",
    ", one obtains @xmath62 the above relations allow us to rewrite the solution @xmath63 as @xmath64 + \\varphi_{j}(\\lambda , x_{j})\\cos\\left[\\sqrt{\\alpha_{j}^{2}-\\lambda^{2}}(x - x_{j})\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] by imposing the remaining boundary conditions on the right boundary of each region we obtain equations that implicitly provide the eigenvalues @xmath44 . more precisely ,",
    "in region @xmath46 we have @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left(a_{2}b_{1}+a_{1}b_{2}\\right)\\cos\\left[\\sqrt{\\alpha_{i}^{2}-\\lambda^{2}}\\left(a-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right ) \\right]=0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in region @xmath48 we have @xmath66 and , finally , in region @xmath50 we obtain @xmath67\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left(d_{2}c_{1}+d_{1}c_{2}\\right)\\cos\\left[\\sqrt{\\alpha_{iii}^{2}-\\lambda^{2}}\\left(l - a-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right ) \\right]=0\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations displayed above have simple zeroes which , in general , can be both real and purely imaginary @xcite .",
    "since , here , we work under the assumption that all the eigenvalues @xmath44 are positive , we will only consider instances in which all the solutions of the equations ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , and ( [ 13 ] ) are real .",
    "these occur only for values of the parameters in the boundary conditions belonging to specific intervals of the real line ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to find these intervals",
    "it is actually more convenient to consider the equations in ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , and ( [ 13 ] ) with the variable @xmath44 replaced with @xmath68 , namely @xmath69\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left(a_{2}b_{1}+a_{1}b_{2}\\right)\\cosh\\left[\\sqrt{\\alpha_{i}^{2}+\\lambda^{2}}\\left(a-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right ) \\right]=0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 and @xmath71\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left(d_{2}c_{1}+d_{1}c_{2}\\right)\\cosh\\left[\\sqrt{\\alpha_{iii}^{2}+\\lambda^{2}}\\left(l - a-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right ) \\right]=0\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , it is not very difficult to show that ( [ 14 ] ) has no real zeroes , and hence ( [ 11 ] ) has no purely imaginary solutions , if the following conditions are satisfied @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and for @xmath75 .",
    "similar conditions apply to ( [ 16 ] ) . in fact , ( [ 13 ] ) has no purely imaginary zeroes when @xmath76 for @xmath77 @xmath78 and for @xmath79 .",
    "equation ( [ 12 ] ) , instead , has only real solutions if @xmath80 when @xmath81 @xmath82 and for @xmath83 .",
    "since , as already mentioned earlier , we are only interested in real eigenvalues @xmath44 we assume for the rest of this work that the coefficients of the boundary conditions in ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) , and ( [ 7 ] ) satisfy the above conditions .",
    "the equations in ( [ 14])-([16 ] ) play a fundamentally important role in expressing the spectral zeta function in each region in terms of a complex integral @xcite . in our case",
    "we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the laplacian @xmath31 , and the functions @xmath86 are defined as @xmath87 with @xmath88 given in ( [ 14 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) , and ( [ 16 ] ) for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "it can be proved , by analyzing the asymptoic behavior of @xmath92 as @xmath93 and as @xmath94 , that the integral representation ( [ 21 ] ) is valid in the region of the complex plane @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy , and hence the force , is obtained from the knowledge of the spectral zeta function in the neighborhood of @xmath3 .",
    "since this point does not belong to the region @xmath95 , the zeta function in ( [ 20 ] ) needs to be analytically continued to the complex semi - plane @xmath96 .    before concluding this section we would like to discuss the limit of infinitely thin pistons .",
    "according to the boundary conditions ( [ 5])-([7 ] ) the left side and the right side of the thick piston are allowed to have different types of boundary conditions . however , in the limit of a thin piston , @xmath29 , it is reasonable to assume that the boundary conditions to the left and right side of the piston must coalesce .",
    "this implies that results regarding infinitely thin pistons can not be obtained by simply taking the limit @xmath29 of the ones for thick pistons .",
    "in fact the correct thin piston limit is obtained not only by performing the limit @xmath29 but also by imposing the following relations @xmath97 and @xmath98 on the parameters describing the boundary conditions on the piston itself .",
    "the restriction @xmath99 indicated in the previous section is due to the behavior of the integrand in ( [ 21 ] ) as @xmath100 . in order to extend the spectral zeta function ( [ 20 ] ) to the region to the left of @xmath101",
    ", one needs to subtract and add an appropriate number of terms of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath102 as @xmath103 uniform in the variable @xmath104 . to obtain the desired asymptotic expansion we use the exponential form of the hyperbolic functions to write @xmath102 in region @xmath46 as @xmath105\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\ln\\left[1+\\varepsilon_{i}(\\lambda z,\\epsilon , a)\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in region @xmath48 as @xmath106\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\ln\\left[1+\\varepsilon_{ii}(\\lambda z,\\epsilon , a)\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , finally , in region @xmath50 as @xmath107\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\ln\\left[1+\\varepsilon_{iii}(\\lambda z,\\epsilon , a)\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath108 describe the exponentially small terms .",
    "the specific form of the uniform asymptotic expansion depends on the value of some of the parameters in the boundary conditions ( [ 5])-([7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , the asymptotic expansion for @xmath109 as @xmath103 uniform in @xmath104 depends on whether the coefficients @xmath110 , @xmath111 or both are either zero or different than zero .",
    "the possible combinations lead to four different forms of the uniform asymptotic expansion of @xmath109 .",
    "obviously , the same remarks hold true for @xmath112 with the parameters @xmath111 and @xmath113 , and for @xmath114 with the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath115 .",
    "a detailed description on how to obtain the uniform asymptotic expansion of @xmath102 can be found in @xcite and , for the sake of brevity , will not be repeated here .",

    "any attempt at a numerical study of the behavior of the casimir force on a thick piston as all the parameters vary simultaneously would lead to quite complex results that would not show the role that each parameter plays in the casimir force . for this reason , in order simplify the analysis , we fix some of the parameters and let the remaining ones be free to vary according to the constraints ( [ 17])-([19a ] ) . in what follows",

    "one can notice that the casimir force acting on the piston increases in absolute value as the thickness of the piston increases .",
    "in other words , the finite thickness somewhat  amplifies \" the casimir force acting on the piston .",
    "there are a few cases in which the casimir force vanishes at more than one point in the interval @xmath196 $ ] , a behavior that has been already observed for infinitely thin pistons with general boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the position of one of the two equilibrium points varies as the thickness of the piston changes . in all of the examples provided above ,",
    "there are specific values ( or a range of values ) of the parameter @xmath173 in which the force acting on a thick piston differs substantially from the force acting on the corresponding infinitely thin piston .",
    "for instance , in the dgdd case one can notice that when @xmath177 $ ] the force on the infinitely thin piston presents a point of stable equilibrium while for a piston of finite thickness the force always tend to move it towards the right end of the piston configuration .",
    "this appears to be a very interesting occurrence and shows that in certain circumstances the casimir force acting on a thick piston behaves quite differently than the force on the corresponding infinitely thin piston .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the casimir energy and force for thick piston configurations endowed with general boundary conditions these configurations are modeled by considering a product manifold @xmath11\\times n$ ] and by dividing it into three distinct regions separated by the manifolds @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the thick piston itself , of thickness @xmath27 , is represented by the region between the cross - sections @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "here we have utilized the spectral zeta function regularization technique in order to compute the casimir energy and the corresponding force .",
    "it is important to point out that the results presented in the previous sections are very general and are valid for any compact smooth riemannian base manifold @xmath12 and any separated boundary conditions that lead to a problem with positive eigenvalues .",
    "the explicit expressions for the casimir energy and force obtained in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] have been specialized in the previous section with the purpose of illustrating a series of particular examples . for the sake of simplicity , we considered cases in which only the thickness of the piston , @xmath27 , and one of the parameters describing the boundary conditions , @xmath173 , are allowed to vary .",
    "it is worth mentioning that due to the general nature of our results one could easily construct and analyze examples different than the ones considered here by imposing any combination of allowed boundary conditions and by using any allowed thickness @xmath27 .",
    "the work performed here lends itself to a number of generalizations especially with regard to the geometry of the piston configuration .",
    "for instance it would be interesting to consider thick spherical pistons with general boundary conditions ; this analysis would extend to thick pistons the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "an additional straightforward generalization consists in studying thick cylindrical pistons with general boundary conditions .",
    "the calculations needed to obtain the casimir energy and force in these cases would follow the ones presented here with the only difference arising from replacing the sine and cosine functions , obtained as solution to ( [ 2 ] ) , with the eigenfunctions of the radial equation for the sphere or cylinder . recently",
    ", some work has been focused on the effect that additional dimensions could have on the casimir force , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the results obtained here to include thick pistons with additional kaluza - klein dimensions .",
    "a particularly compelling analysis would be centered on trying to answer the question of how the extra dimensions affect the force on pistons of different thickness and general boundary conditions .",
    "perhaps one could find an ideal combination of thickness and boundary conditions that would somewhat facilitate the detection of possible extra dimensions by measuring the casimir force on a thick piston .",
