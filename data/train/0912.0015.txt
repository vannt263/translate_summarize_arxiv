    "one may complement the measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath181 with a measurement of the axion cdm velocity dispersion @xmath332 .",
    "the latter allows non - standard cosmologies to be distinguished , at least in principle .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows .    when axions start to oscillate at the temperature @xmath49 , axions from vacuum realignment and axionic string decay have momentum dispersion of order the hubble scale at @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath333 the momentum dispersion scales with the scale factor as @xmath334 . in the standard cosmology , the velocity dispersion at present is then @xmath335    in the kination cosmology , @xmath336 it is clear that if one has measured @xmath181 , a measurement of @xmath332 will give the value of @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , in the ltr cosmology , @xmath337    a difficulty in measuring @xmath332 may arise from virialization of the axion population within galactic dark halos , although it has been claimed that @xmath332 would be preserved in the phase - space evolution @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have examined the parameter regions in which the axion is 100% of the cold dark matter density in cosmologies that are non - standard before big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "we have recognized two ways in which these regions change in going from the standard cosmology to the non - standard cases .",
    "if the peccei - quinn symmetry breaks after the end of inflation ( scenario i ) , the axion cdm regions shift to different values of the axion mass @xmath181 ( or of the corresponding pq scale @xmath24 ) .",
    "if the pq symmetry breaks during inflation ( scenario ii ) , the axion cdm regions can shrink or expand according to the cosmological model .",
    "we have considered two different non - standard cosmologies that change the axion cdm regions in opposite directions . in the low temperature reheating ( ltr ) cosmology , the axion cdm regions shift to lower axion masses in scenario i and expand in scenario ii . in the kination cosmology ,",
    "the axion cdm regions shift to higher axion masses in scenario i and shrink in scenario ii .",
    "we have also commented on the possibility to distinguish standard and non - standard cosmologies using observable properties of the axion cdm population .",

    "<S> we study the parameter space of cold dark matter axions in two cosmological scenarios with non - standard thermal histories before big bang nucleosynthesis : the low temperature reheating ( ltr ) cosmology and the kination cosmology . if the peccei - quinn symmetry breaks during inflation , we find more allowed parameter space in the ltr cosmology than in the standard cosmology and less in the kination cosmology . on the contrary , if the peccei - quinn symmetry breaks after inflation , the peccei - quinn scale is orders of magnitude higher than standard in the ltr cosmology and lower in the kination cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the axion velocity dispersion may be used to distinguish some of these non - standard cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , axion cold dark matter may be a good probe of the history of the universe before big bang nucleosynthesis .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard cosmological model has been tested up to a temperature @xmath0 , or down to times as short as @xmath1 , when big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) occurred . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the bbn theory is due to its great precision in predicting the primordial abundance of light elements d , @xmath2he and @xmath3li . for the success of bbn </S>",
    "<S> , the universe must be radiation - dominated at temperatures @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to lack of data prior to bbn , the history of the universe in the pre - bbn epoch @xmath5 mev is only indirectly inferred .    in the standard cosmology </S>",
    "<S> , radiation has been dominating the energy density of the universe before bbn since the very early time at which inflation ended . how radiation was produced at the end of inflation from a state of negligible temperature </S>",
    "<S> is still a topic of active research : models include the decay of the inflaton field @xcite and parametric resonance @xcite .    in alternative cosmological models </S>",
    "<S> , inflation may have ended at times close to bbn @xcite , or there might have been a period after inflation in which the dominant energy density was not in radiation but in some other exotic form , like the energy density of a scalar field @xcite , or still more there could have been an injection of entropy into the radiation @xcite .    a good probe of the history of the universe before @xmath6 is a relic particle that has survived from that period . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> in the standard cosmology , dark matter relics like axions @xcite and weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ( see @xcite ) are produced when the universe was @xmath7 or between @xmath8 and @xmath9 old ( corresponding respectively to the age of the universe at the qcd phase transition or at the wimp freeze - out for wimp masses between 10 gev and 1 tev ) . </S>",
    "<S> these dark matter relics are therefore excellent candidates to test the cosmological history of the universe at very early epochs @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study cold dark matter ( cdm ) axions @xcite as probes of the pre - bbn epoch , assuming that axions provide the totality of the cdm observed , @xmath10 with @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the axion and cdm energy densities in units of the critical density @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two non - standard pre - bbn cosmologies : the low - temperature reheating ( ltr ) cosmology @xcite and the kination cosmology @xcite . in the ltr </S>",
    "<S> cosmology the expansion of the universe after inflation is driven by a massive scalar field @xmath17 that decays and reheats the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this stage lasts down to a temperature @xmath18 , after which standard radiation - dominated cosmology applies . in the kination cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> the energy content of the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field which evolves without entropy release down to a temperature @xmath19 , after which standard cosmology begins .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that with respect to the standard cosmology , if the peccei - quinn symmetry in the axion theory breaks during inflation , the allowed axion parameter space is enlarged in the ltr cosmology and restricted in the kination cosmology . instead , if the peccei - quinn symmetry breaks after inflation , the mass of cold dark matter axions in the ltr cosmology is orders of magnitude smaller than its standard - cosmology value , and it is orders of magnitude greater in the kination cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> past work on axions in non - standard cosmologies has examined the parameter space of hot dark matter axions in the ltr and kination cosmologies @xcite , and the cosmological bound @xmath20 for cold ( i.e.  non - thermal ) axions in the ltr cosmology assuming that the peccei - quinn symmetry breaks after inflation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our work studies axions as 100@xmath21 of the cold dark matter , allows the pq symmetry to break after or during inflation , and includes anharmonicities in the axion potential .    in section [ production_of_axion_cdm ] </S>",
    "<S> , we review the two most important mechanisms of axion production , the misalignment mechanism and axionic string decays , focusing on how to extend the standard results for these mechanisms to any non - standard cosmology . in section [ axion cdm in the standard scenario ] , we review the present axion energy density @xmath22 in the standard cosmology . in section [ axion cdm in the low temperature reheating scenario ] </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the density @xmath23 and present our results for the axion parameter space for the ltr cosmology . in section [ axion cdm in the kination scenario ] , we do the same for the kination cosmology . in section [ discussion ] </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to previous work , discuss how our results may be modified by different choices of axionic string parameters , and suggest a possibility of distinguishing non - standard pre - bbn cosmologies observationally . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] . </S>"
