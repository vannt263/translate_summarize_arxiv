    "the presence of molecules in interstellar space was predicted as early as 1930 s ( e.g. , @xcite ) , quickly followed by identification of simple diatomic species , ch , cn , ch@xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in optical absorption spectra .",
    "these early observations lead to important insights into the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the optical and uv observations are limited to diffuse or translucent clouds and applications of molecular spectroscopy to studies of the dense interstellar medium had to await the development of microwave detection techniques in the 1960s .",
    "since the first microwave detections of molecules in space @xcite , molecular spectroscopy has been a premier tool for studying interstellar gas cloud physics , from the milky way @xcite to the high - redshift universe @xcite . in order to use molecules as quantitative tracers of star - forming clouds ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the radiative and collisional processes that govern the excitation of their internal quantum states @xcite . for decades",
    ", it has been theorized that , under interstellar conditions , some molecules form via highly - exothermic reactions between ions and neutral molecules @xcite . however ,",
    "quantitative models of chemistry and of excitation have conventionally been constructed independently , on the grounds that chemical time - scales are long compared with excitation time - scales .",
    "the most abundant interstellar molecule , molecular hydrogen , is a symmetric rotor without a permanent dipole moment , which only has weak quadrupole rovibrational transitions in its ground electronic state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its uv electronic transitions can only be studied from space and the observations are limited to the relatively nearby diffuse and translucent clouds .",
    "the infrared rovibrational lines are accessible from the ground , but are only excited in warm , active environments , such as shocks or photon dominated regions .",
    "consequently , trace molecules , with rich rotational spectra in the millimeter to far - infrared wavelength range have been used as proxies of h@xmath1 , to understand the physical conditions in the star - forming gas reservoir of the milky way and external galaxies . of these ,",
    "oblate symmetric top molecules , in particular ammonia @xcite , for which the @xmath2 level is the lowest energy level in each @xmath3 ladder , are of great utility for the temperature determination .",
    "the population of these `` metastable '' levels is assumed to be thermalized at the kinetic temperature of the medium , due to the absence of allowed radiative transitions out of these levels .",
    "the hydronium ion , , is another oblate symmetric rotor , isoelectronic with ammonia , which like ammonia has the characteristic inversion splitting of its rotational levels . in the case of",
    ", however , the splitting is very large @xcite and the inversion transitions occur at far - infrared wavelengths , as opposed to centimeter wavelengths for ammonia .",
    "the far - infrared  inversion transitions , up to ( 11,11 ) , have only recently been detected for the first time by _ herschel _ , in absorption toward the central region of the milky way @xcite .",
    "earlier hifi observations of the hydronium ion toward sagittarius  b2 indicated a high rotational temperature , 500  k , at velocities corresponding to the cloud envelope .",
    "@xcite suggested that , in regions exposed to ionizing radiation , such as those at the center of the milky way , highly - excited states of the hydronium ion and ammonia are populated mainly by exoergic chemical formation processes and temperatures derived from their spectra do not represent the physical temperature of the medium .",
    "the detection of highly - excited states of the hydronium ion in nearby active galaxies , with rotational temperatures similar to that observed in sagittarius b2 @xcite , demonstrated the universality of the shape of the observed population diagrams in _ active _ environments .",
    "here we present new sensitive _ herschel _ observations of the hydronium ion on the lines of sight toward sagittarius b2(n ) and w31c ( g10.6 - 0.4 ) , which clearly demonstrate that this effect is not limited to the environments of galactic nuclei , characterized by high x - ray and cosmic ray fluxes , but is a _",
    "fundamental _ property , pervasive throughout the interstellar medium .",
    "the inversion lines of  were first discovered in absorption in the full spectral scans of sagittarius  b2(m ) and ( n ) carried out between 2010 march and 2011 april using the heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared ( hifi ; @xcite ) on the herschel space observatory @xcite , within the framework of the hexos guaranteed time key program @xcite .",
    "preliminary analysis of the sagittarius  b2(n ) data was presented by @xcite .",
    "the data presented here have been re - reduced using an improved version of the hifi pipeline , which results in significantly lower noise levels in the high - frequency heb mixer bands .",
    "the source coordinates are : sagittarius  b2(m ) @xmath4 ; sagittarius  b2(n ) @xmath5 .",
    "the line survey data have been calibrated with hipe version 10.0 @xcite and the resulting double - sideband ( dsb ) spectra were subsequently reduced using the gildas class software package .",
    "basic data reduction steps included removal of spurious features or otherwise unusable portions of the spectra .",
    "the continuum emission was then subtracted from the dsb scans by fitting a low - order ( typically 01 , in a few cases 2 ) polynomial .",
    "the continuum - subtracted dsb data were deconvolved ( sideband separation through pure @xmath6 minimization ; @xcite ) to provide a single - sideband ( ssb ) spectrum for each hifi band .",
    "the variation of the continuum intensity as a function of frequency was determined from the least - squares fit to the emission - free spectral channels across all hifi bands .",
    "the fitted continuum was subsequently folded back into the deconvolved , baseline subtracted spectra .",
    "the data reduction procedure ensures that saturated absorption features reach the zero continuum level and there are no discontinuities in the overlap regions between the various hifi bands .",
    "in addition to the full hifi spectral scans , we obtained deep follow - up integrations at the frequencies of the ( 6,6 ) and ( 9,9 ) inversion transitions of the hydronium ion toward sagittarius b2(n ) and w31c .",
    "these observations were carried out in 2012 october 417 in the framework of the special , final call for _ herschel _ observing proposals , referred to by esa as `` must - do '' programs .",
    "the source coordinates for w31c are @xmath7 and for sagittarius  b2 are the same as the earlier hexos observations .",
    "the data were taken in the double beam switching ( dbs ) mode , with the reference beams 180  away from the source , using the hifi wideband spectrometer ( wbs ) , which provides a 1.1 .",
    "mhz frequency resolution over the 2.4  ghz bandwidth of the band 7 heb receivers .",
    "three shifted lo settings were observed , which were subsequently averaged together after inspecting the spectra for possible line contamination from image sideband ( no contamination was found ) .",
    "the total observing time for each of the two sources was 53 and 56 min for the ( 6,6 ) and ( 9,9 ) lines , respectively .",
    "spectra from the hifi heb mixer bands are known to be adversely affected by standing waves originating in the signal amplification chain .",
    "this problem is particularly apparent in long integrations , such as the deep sagittarius  b2(n ) and w31c observations presented here , where the detector power levels can drift significantly , resulting in a disparity between the `` on '' and `` off '' phases of the observation . since the standing waves occur in the electrical chain , where the reflecting components have complex frequency - dependent impedance , the resulting baseline ripple has a non - sinusoidal behavior and it is difficult to remove using standard standing wave removal techniques @xcite .",
    "fortunately the standing wave phase and amplitude are stable for a given mismatch between the `` on '' and `` off '' phases .",
    "therefore , the spectra can be corrected by subtracting a standing wave profile from similarly mismatched template spectra .",
    "this approach has been applied here to the individual integrations , before they were averaged together to produce the final spectra .",

    "moreover , strong x - ray emission in iron fluorescence at 6.4  kev has been taken as evidence that the envelope of sagittarius b2 was recently illuminated by an x - ray flash , attributable to a flare from the region around the central black hole that is associated with the sagittarius a@xmath163 radio continuum source @xcite .",

    "the absorption is attributed to molecular gas in spiral arms of an ordinary galaxy at a redshift of 0.89 .",
    "explanations similar to those previously invoked to explain the high - rotational temperatures of ammonia can not easily be applied to h@xmath165o@xmath0 : if the density were high enough to thermalize the populations of highly excited rotational states at a kinetic temperature of 400 to 600  k , then molecular collisions would also raise the excitation temperatures of the high-@xmath166 inversion doublets to values higher than the brightness temperature of the continuum radiation at @xmath167  . in that case , the inversion lines could not appear in absorption as is observed .",

    "the line of sight to w31c presents a simpler test case because it lies entirely outside the central molecular zone , where conditions are extreme . for illustration , consider the low - density limit , in which collisional excitation is neglected and the rotational populations are governed entirely by the formation process and radiative transitions . let the state - specific formation rate of h@xmath165o@xmath0 be described by @xmath199 for each state of rotational quantum numbers @xmath166 , @xmath3 , and parity @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the statistical weight , @xmath202 is the energy , @xmath203 is the partition function , and @xmath204 is a parameter  the formation temperature .",
    "the populations of the vibration - rotation levels are then computed by solving the rate equations with formation , destruction , and all radiative transitions included ( equations 1215 of @xcite ) , but with all the collisional terms set to zero .",
    "the results of one example are compared with the observed population diagram in figure  4 . in this case , @xmath205 s@xmath172 ( corresponding to @xmath206 @xmath179 at @xmath207 k ) and the total column density is @xmath208 @xmath169 .",
    "the formation temperature is @xmath209 k and the molecules are exposed to an average galactic background continuum similar to that described by @xcite . at the adopted destruction rate ,",
    "@xmath210 @xmath179 s@xmath172 is required to attain a good match in column density over a total path length @xmath211 pc .",
    "this rate , in turn , would imply a rate of cosmic - ray ionization of h@xmath1 , @xmath212 s@xmath172 for a density @xmath213 @xmath169 and @xmath214",
    ". this ionization rate would be consistent with that derived by @xcite toward w51 irs2 if the h@xmath165o@xmath0 is found preferentially in regions of higher molecular fraction and higher @xmath191 than the observed oh@xmath0 .",
    "these conditions are also in harmony with photochemical models of diffuse molecular gas as discussed by @xcite",
    ".        a combined excitation - chemistry model , which includes explicitly the exothermicity of the chemical reactions leading to the formation of the hydronium ion and ammonia is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be presented separately ( j. black , in prep . )",
    "such calculations are clearly needed to demonstrate that chemistry and excitation are closely coupled in some interstellar environments and should not be treated separately and to use  as a quantitative tracer of the cosmic ray ionization rate .",
    "this aspect is of particular interest for understanding the energetics of the nuclear regions of ultraluminous , star - forming galaxies .",
    "highly - excited inversion lines of the hydronium ion have now been detected in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp  220 , as well as in ngc  4418 , which harbors a deeply buried , compact agn @xcite . in these environments , the hydronium ion absorption traces a relatively low - density molecular gas with a large filling factor , which is directly influenced by the feedback process of the central engine .",
    "the traditional explanation for these observations invokes a new phase of the interstellar medium , which would have to be heated by some combinations of x - rays , cosmic rays , shocks , or turbulence to 500 k. if the chemical formation pumping explanation is correct , this additional energy input is not required  the observations can simply be explained by chemical formation pumping in a much lower temperature medium .",
    "this relaxes the heating requirements and simplifies the physical picture of the interstellar medium in these active environments . with the improved understanding of the excitation ,",
    "the far - infrared inversion lines of the hydronium ion also provide an accurate measurement of the ionization rate in the mostly molecular gas component of high - redshift galaxies , using alma , highly complementary to the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 observations that primarily trace atomic gas , with low molecular fraction @xcite .",
    "symmetric top molecules have been proven to be some of the best tracers of the gas kinetic temperature in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "however , the results presented here suggest that they may sometimes fail as an interstellar thermometer , under specific conditions .",
    "this typically involves low - density , diffuse gas , as collisions and strong radiation field tend to drive the rotational level population to equilibrium conditions .",
    "consequently , care has to be taken when interpreting the derived rotational temperatures as physical temperatures of the medium .",
