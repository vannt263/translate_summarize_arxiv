    "a quantitative understanding of the electrostatic interactions between charged macroions in solution is fundamental to comprehend a plethora of physical phenomena spanning from biology to material science , for example the macroscopic and rheological properties of colloidal suspensions[1,2 ] .",
    "the details of such interactions are difficult to capture , as the effective interactions are determined by the interplay between the different components dissolved in solution ( macroions , counterions , salt ions ) and the solvent dielectric response[3 ] .",
    "in addition , when the system is driven out of equilibrium , for example by an external electric field causing electrophoretic flow , hydrodynamic interactions between the solvent and solute species must also be included and can alter the equilibrium electrostatic interactions .",
    "the simplest yet very useful model to describe electrolyte solutions is the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) approach[1,4 ] , which builds on a continuous description of the electrolyte , characterized in terms of the anion and cation local densities . within this framework ,",
    "it is possible to add charged macroscopic objects , with fixed surface charges , by accordingly changing the electrostatic boundary conditions of the pb equations .",
    "notwithstanding pb is a mean - field theory that defines ions as point - like and therefore neglects excluded volume effects and spatial correlation due to their finite size , it has been successfully adopted to describe various physical systems , for example to derive the electrostatic part of dlvo interparticle potential[1 ] which explains the interactions of weakly charged particles in solution at low volume fraction .    the zeta potential , @xmath0 , defined as the electrostatic potential at the colloid surface , or slippling plane , plays a central role for charged colloidal dispersions , as it indirectly provides an estimate of the magnitude of the electric field between particles that results from the combined effect of ionized charged groups sitting on the particle , counterions released into solution and salt ions .",
    "theoretically , ohshima _",
    "et al._[5 ] obtained an exact analytic expression relating the surface charge density to the zeta potential for an infinitely dilute spherical colloidal suspension by carefully approximating the non - linear pb equation .",
    "this expression is of limited use , since the infinite dilution regime is difficult to achieve .",
    "moreover , experimentally @xmath0 is normally derived out of equilibrium , from electrophoretic mobility measurements . since , _ a priori _ , the values of @xmath0 in equilibrium and at steady",
    "state will differ , an accurate description of hydrodynamics must be included in order to derive the relationship between @xmath0 and the colloid mobility .",
    "analytical results for the electrophoretic flow at finite dilution can not in general be obtained .",
    "computationally , different models have been used to describe electrophoresis[6 - 9,11 ] .",
    "_ et al._[8 ] and dnweg",
    "_ et al_[9 ] , using a lattice boltzmann[10 ] ( lb ) solver coupled to molecular dynamics of ions , calculate the particle mobility for low to zero salt concentration explicitly accounting for finite ions size , but without providing results for @xmath0 .",
    "et al._[11 ] show agreement with ohshima s results , but only for weakly charged particles at low salt concentration .",
    "cell models[12 ] are also employed to describe electrokinetics and to derive mobility versus @xmath0 curves ; however , they rely on somewhat arbitrary boundary conditions both for electrostatics and hydrodynamics .    in this paper , we compute @xmath0 using a mesoscopic model that couples a navier - stokes solver to the convection and diffusion of ions on a lattice .",
    "we will first investigate the difference between @xmath0 values at thermodynamic equilibrium and at electrophoretic steady state .",
    "we then accurately analyze the dependence of @xmath0 on colloid volume fraction , @xmath1 , and salt and counterions concentration , and compare them with predictions from pb at infinite dilution derived by ohshima _",
    "et al._[5 ] .",
    "finally , we will address how to identify the electrostatic radius of a colloid on a lattice , as it has been done previously for the hydrodynamics radius[13 ] . in the following section",
    ", we briefly introduce our model , the reference equations and results that can be obtained using pb equation for infinite dilution and at finite volume fractions .",
    "we present in section [ results ] results for @xmath0 as a function of the volume fraction , salt concentration and lattice refinement .",
    "finally , we draw our main conclusions in the last section .",
    "in order to derive a correct relation between the mobility and the zeta potential at steady state during electrophoresis , our model includes hydrodynamic interactions and electric forces due to local charge densities , @xmath2,\\ ] ] @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the diffusivities and valences of positive and negative ions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the solvent density , velocity , ideal pressure and shear viscosity , @xmath8 is the electron charge , @xmath9 is the boltzmann factor , @xmath10 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath11 the solvent permittivity .",
    ".  [ eq1 ] expresses ions mass conservation during diffusion and advection , coupling ion dynamics to solvent motion .",
    "this is in turn described by the navier - stokes equation for a viscous fluid which couples solvent dynamics to electrostatic forces due to local charge density , eq .  [ eq2 ] .",
    "finally , the poisson equation enforces the electrostatic coupling between the charged species and the embedded solid particles .",
    "we solve these electrokinetics equations combining an lb approach for the momentum dynamics with a numerical solver for the discretized convection - diffusion dynamics , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , based on link fluxes[14 ] .",
    "each lattice site is labeled as solid or fluid and we consider here a single spherical object of radius @xmath12 embedded in a cubic lattice of volume @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions . suspended particles are therefore resolved and interact with the neighbouring fluid through bounce - back[13 ] . the electrostatic potential is computed using a successive over - relaxation scheme ( sor)[16 ] .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to analyze different dynamical processes involving suspensions of charged objects[15,17,18,19 ] .      at equilibrium , using a mean - field approach that neglects excluded volume effects and correlation between ions , pb equation reads[4 ] @xmath14 where a symmetric electrolyte @xmath15 has been used for simplicity and @xmath16 , the uniform macroscopic counterion and coion number concentration far from the colloid @xmath17 , is assumed to be equal to that of an electrolyte reservoir with dissolved salt @xmath18 .",
    "an analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ pbeq ] ) for a single particle is not available , as the pb equation can be solved analytically only for a few symmetrical configurations .",
    "et al._[5 ] analyzed eq .",
    "( [ pbeq ] ) around a spherical colloid of charge @xmath19 using a perturbative approach and derived a quasi - exact analytical expression for @xmath0 , @xmath20^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the inverse of the debye length , @xmath22 the bjerrun length and @xmath23 the adimensional zeta potential .",
    "useful global information can be obtained using the debye - hckel approximation , i.e. linearizing eq .",
    "( [ pbeq ] ) . when @xmath24 , @xmath25 from which one can derive the electrostatic potential around a charged spherical colloid @xmath26 in the linear regime , a charged particle in the presence of salt develops a screened , yukawa - like electrostatic potential , with a characteristic length scale of @xmath27 and strength given by the zeta potential , @xmath0 .",
    "eq.([pbeq ] ) is strictly valid when the amounts of positive and negative charges dissolved in solution are equal , i.e. when the counterions concentration is negligible .",
    "experimentally , this can be obtained separating the colloidal particles from a bulk electrolyte solution with a semi - permeable membrane . for the experimental set - ups with non - zero concentration of counterions , eq .",
    "( [ dheq ] ) becomes @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are the reference salt and counterion concentrations in the reservoir .",
    "( [ dheq2 ] ) stresses the fact that , especially at low salt concentration @xmath30 ( low @xmath31 ) and high volume fraction @xmath32 ( high @xmath33 ) , a deviation from the theoretical debye - hckel results can be observed .",
    "our aim is to measure @xmath0 for different experimental regimes , analyze its behavior beyond the linear approximation ( when @xmath34 ) and understand how to overcome the intrinsic inaccuracies in the location of the electrostatic radius of any lattice model . in the lb approach",
    ", we will refer to @xmath0 as the average electrostatic potential between lattice points pairs ( boundary links ) @xmath35 that link a colloid and a fluid node calculated half - way between the two nodes using linear approximation , @xmath36 and will analyze when such an assumption is representative of the colloid @xmath0 .",
    "we have performed simulations for a single spherical particle of radius @xmath37 embedded in cubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions , also varying the concentration of added salt . in order to avoid finite - size effects , for a given salt concentration we use a lattice length l at least three times the corresponding debye length , @xmath27 .",
    "we have distributed uniformly the colloid charge @xmath19 on the lattice sites the colloid fills , and choose @xmath19 to correspond to the predicted value of oshima , according to eq.([ohshima ] ) .",
    "we will analyze both a magnitude of @xmath19 which lies in the linear regime , @xmath38 , and one for which the colloid is within the nonlinear regime , @xmath39 .",
    "we finally set the external electric field to @xmath40 , well within the linear regime @xmath41 .",
    "the values for @xmath0 obtained from electrophoresis are in principle different from those computed in equilibrium .",
    "this is analogous to the different measurements for the size of a solvated particle , at equilibrium or at hydrodynamic steady state ( hydrodynamic radius ) .",
    "we have therefore computed @xmath42 at thermodynamic equilibrium , i.e. with equilibrated charges and fluid at rest and dynamically , when a steady state due to the external electric field is reached . in all simulations ,",
    "our results show that the differences between the two values of @xmath0 are smaller than the statistical precision .",
    "this similarity is expected because of the small magnitude of the perturbing electric field and colloid pclet number , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the velocity of the colloid at steady state . for @xmath45",
    "the deformation of the salt cloud around the colloid induces significant deviations in the electrophoretic mobility[18 ] ; we can hence envisage a corresponding departure of the dynamic @xmath0 from its equilibrium counterpart .",
    "typically , as for simulations here , @xmath46 and particle mobility does not depend on @xmath47 , hence the measured @xmath0 values at equilibrium and steady state are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "as the only theoretical result available , @xmath48 , is valid for a single particle in equilibrium at infinite dilution , we will compare the simulation results with eq.([ohshima ] ) to assess the role of the counterion concentration at finite volume fraction .",
    "in addition , in order to analyze to which extent the midpoint stands as a proper definition for the electrostatic radius , we run a pair of simulations for each colloid charge , volume fraction and salt concentration used , changing the resolution of the colloid in the lattice from low , using colloid radius @xmath49 , to high @xmath50 , also doubling the corresponding box sizes ( e.g. from @xmath51 at low resolution to @xmath52 at high resolution for the highest volume fraction ) .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] displays @xmath42 for a weakly charged colloid ( @xmath53 ) as a function of the system size and salt concentrations , where the left(right ) panel corresponds to a low(high ) colloid resolution .",
    "the top panels show that the deviation of @xmath54 from oshima s prediction varying @xmath1 appears indirectly only through the corresponding change in the co- and counter - ion concentrations because the deviation decreases when the salt concentration is increased .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ dheq2 ] ) , we can gain understanding by analyzing the dependence of @xmath42 on the ratio between the concentration of counterions released by the particle , @xmath55 ( which decreases as @xmath1 increases ) and the concentration of salt @xmath56 dissolved in the system ( which is independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the bottom panels confirm an agreement within @xmath57 between @xmath42 and @xmath48 for @xmath58 . in addition , comparing the left and right panels , we conclude that in the linear regime the lattice resolution does not play a significant role , as for a given salt concentration @xmath42 does not differ significantly and the use of a more computationally expensive refined lattice only reduces the error bars .",
    "in addition , we note from bottom - rigth panel that discretization effects become more relevant when increasing the salt concentration .",
    "this sensitivity is associated to the reduction of @xmath27 and the corresponding loss of resolution in the electrostatic potential around the colloid .",
    "[ fig2 ] , organized analogously to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , shows results for a strongly charged colloid , @xmath59 , for which the linearized debye - hckel approximation does not hold .",
    "we observe that the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath1 enters again indirectly through the relative changes in @xmath55 , and that the convergence toward @xmath48 can only be expected for high @xmath56 .",
    "however , as opposed to the linearized regime , adding salt can lead up to a @xmath60 overestimation of @xmath42 for the highest salt concentration analyzed ( @xmath61 ) , especially when using a low resolution lattice ( left panels ) . in this strong coupling regime",
    "the electrostatic potential decays faster than @xmath27[1 ] .",
    "this strong nonlinear behavior invalidates the midpoint as the natural choice for the electrostatic radius , which develops a dependence on the system parameters even when the effects of finite @xmath1 and @xmath55 are negligible .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the measured electrostatic potential at the midpoint between a solid and fluid node , @xmath42 , together with the two extreme situations where the electrostatic potential is averaged over the solid and the fluid nodes corresponding to the boundary links .",
    "one can observe , as expected , that @xmath42 always lies in between the other two estimates of @xmath54 .",
    "the differences observed between the left and right panels indicate that the increase in resolution does not affect significantly @xmath42 , while decreases the inaccuracy in the estimate of the limiting values for @xmath54 .",
    "generically , the better resolved the colloidal particle ( and the corresponding decay of the electrostatic potential , @xmath10 ) the less spreading between the different electrostatic potential estimates .",
    "when we increase @xmath55 , oshima s prediction does no longer hold and eq .",
    "( [ ohshima ] ) can not be used to identify the electrostatic radius as can be appreciated in the rightmost values of @xmath54 in the bottom panels .",
    "however , the weak dependence of @xmath10 in the boundary fluid nodes suggests that when @xmath42 is no longer valid , we can still identify a electrostatic radius slightly larger than the one associated to @xmath42 .",
    "analogously to the hydrodynamic radius , an _ ad hoc _ calibration of the electrostatic radius at all salt concentrations must be done to perform quantitative studies of the electrokinetics of colloidal suspensions with lb .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed how to determine the electrostatic potential at the surface of a particle , or zeta potential @xmath0 , for a colloidal suspension . to this end , we have made use of a hybrid mesoscopic model which couples a discrete lattice formulation of boltzmann s kinetic equation for the solvent to a discrete solution of the convection - diffusion equation for the charged ion species dissolved in the fluid which implies treating counter- and salt ions as scalar fields at the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) level .",
    "we have found that for weakly perturbing electric fields , it is not possible to distinguish between the equilibrium and dynamic zeta potentials .",
    "we expect differences will arise when the deformation of the charge layer around the colloid becomes significant , a scenario which can be achieved , e.g. when the pclet number of the dissolved ions is not negligible .",
    "in particular , the comparison with oshima s expression for @xmath54 at infinite dilution has allowed us to carry out quantitative checks to validate the code performance .",
    "we have seen that the counterion concentration has a significant effect on @xmath54 , leading to a decrease in its magnitude both in the linear and nonlinear regimes away from oshima s result .",
    "we have shown that the ratio between counterion and salt concentration controls the departure from oshima s prediction , and that its prediction works reasonably well for @xmath62 .",
    "we have also assessed the relevance of the lattice resolution and have quantified its effects .",
    "we have seen that the mean of @xmath54 over the boundary nodes which determine the colloidal shape is in general a good estimate of the electrostatic radius .",
    "however , for highly charged colloids a more refined choice of the particle radius will be in general needed .",
    "the effective radius will be slightly larger than predicted from @xmath42 due to the nonlinear decay of the electrostatic potential around the particle . this effective electrostatic radius , which needs to be calibrated as a function of the salt concentration and particle radius , will in general differ from the particle hydrodynamic radius and requires a separate analysis .",
    "the overall dependence of the electrostatic radius both on the applied field and ion concentrations is weaker than the one observed for the hydrodynamic radius . in most situations",
    "we expect that an equilibrium calibration correcting from the finite counterion concentration will provide a quantitative estimate for the electrokinetics of colloidal suspensions .",
