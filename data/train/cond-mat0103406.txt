    "excitons in conventional band insulators are well - described by wannier theory  @xcite .",
    "a wannier exciton is a charge neutral optical excitation made of an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band , bound together by the coulomb attraction between them . in inorganic semiconductors like gaas the typical binding energy , as defined by the energy difference between the exciton and the band edge of the particle - hole continuum ,",
    "is several mev .",
    "this should be compared to the band gap itself , which is of the order of one  ev .",
    "concomitantly the typical size of a wannier exciton is of the order of 100   , which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "we note that although the total spin of an optically excited exciton is necessarily zero , it is composed of two quasiparticles carrying spin-1/2 .    in quasi one - dimensional materials like conjugated polymers  @xcite",
    "the situation is quite different . here",
    "the electron - electron interaction accounts , to a substantial degree , for the optical gap itself  @xcite as well as for the formation of excitons .",
    "the exciton binding energy in , e.g. , polydiacetylenes is found to be of the order of 0.5  ev  @xcite and is thus comparable to the optical gap of 2.4  ev in 3bcmu - polydiacetylene chains diluted in their monomer matrix  @xcite .",
    "the exciton size was estimated  @xcite to be 12     and is thus comparable to the length of the unit cell of  5   .",
    "these facts suggest that electron - electron interactions will play an important role in any theoretical description of excitons in these materials .",
    "realistic models for conjugated polymers must account for the effects of both electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions . the interplay between these makes the reliable calculation of the optical conductivity a very demanding task . as a first step it is therefore natural to investigate the effects of the two mechanisms separately  @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity for models with only electron - lattice coupling such as the celebrated su - schrieffer - heeger model has been widely analyzed in the literature  @xcite and is well established . as an extension of this approach ,",
    "electron - electron interactions have been taken into account perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "in contrast there are comparatively few reliable results for the optical spectrum in models that take account of the sizable electron - electron interaction  @xcite .",
    "the interaction drives these systems into a mott - insulating ground state  @xcite .",
    "the scarcity of results is due to the difficulties associated with the calculation of excited state properties in one - dimensional mott insulators .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable interest to develop reliable methods for the investigation of optical excitations in correlated electron systems , and to determine the optical conductivity of one - dimensional mott insulators .",
    "in this paper we focus on the calculation of the optical conductivity in models with electron - electron interactions only .",
    "we study an extended hubbard model with nearest and next - nearest neighbor density - density interactions ; the model is further specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we employ two recently developed numerical and analytical techniques to determine the real part of the optical conductivity over the full frequency range and analyze exciton properties without suffering from finite - size limitations ; for a first application to the hubbard model , see ref .  .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : dmrg ] we first test the dynamical density - matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) by applying it to the limit of large mott gaps where analytical results are available  @xcite .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between numerical and analytical results , and confirm the clear and simple physical picture of an exciton as a bound state of a double occupancy and an empty lattice site in a background of singly occupied sites .",
    "we then move on to the generic case of intermediate mott gaps and find qualitatively the same physical behavior .    in the regime of small mott gaps ,",
    "finite - size effects and finite resolution of the ddmrg start to hamper the numerical analysis .",

    "we determine the optical conductivity in the field - theory limit . here",
    ", the spin sector does not couple to the current operator so that it is sufficient to analyze the charge sector only . the exciton is then described as a bound state of a holon and an antiholon , which are the elementary charge excitations in the theory .",
    "the resulting picture for small mott gaps remains very similar to the cases of intermediate to large gaps .",
    "we even find quantitative agreement between field theory and ddmrg results for intermediate mott gaps where the applicability of field theory is not a priori expected .    in sec .",

    "hubbard excitons exist only when the intersite coulomb repulsion exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "in general , the exciton binding energy is not related in a simple way to the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we analyze a new correlation function which allows to define the size of an exciton in correlated electron systems .",

    "note that we have chosen the chemical potential in such a way that the hamiltonian explicitly exhibits a particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this hamiltonian has two other discrete symmetries which are useful for optical excitation calculations : a spin - flip symmetry and a spatial - reflection symmetry ( through the lattice center ) .",
    "therefore , each eigenstate of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has a well - defined parity under charge conjugation ( @xmath12 ) and spin flip ( @xmath13 ) , and belongs to one of the two irreducible representations , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , of a one - dimensional lattice reflection symmetry group .",

    "linear optical absorption is one of the most commonly used probes in experimental studies of the dynamical properties of a material .",

    "the use of a logarithmic scale also reveals deviations around the second exciton ( @xmath109 ) and close to the upper band edge ( @xmath110 ) , which are associated with difficulties in the numerical determination of small contributions to the optical spectrum , and remaining finite - size and boundary effects .",

    "@xmath305 decreases exponentially and we can use the analysis  ( [ howtodefineexcitonsize ] ) to determine the exciton size @xmath308 .",

    "as the binding energy @xmath268 , the exciton size @xmath308 does not depend in a simple way on the coulomb interaction strength and even displays a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath19 , first decreasing as @xmath19 increases , then sharply increasing as @xmath19 approaches the critical regime @xmath177 .",
    "as expected , @xmath308 becomes larger and seems to diverge as @xmath268 vanishes , while it diminishes when @xmath268 becomes larger if the gap @xmath55 is kept ( approximately ) constant .",
    "we note that the operator used in  ( [ exccorrelation ] ) is antisymmetric with respect to charge conjugation , as is the current operator  ( [ currentop ] ) .",

    "@xmath330    we see that this size diverges when we approach from below the coupling constant @xmath280 , at which the @xmath331-th exciton is first formed .",
    "for example , the first exciton splits off the holon - antiholon continuum at @xmath332 and its size displays a square - root divergence for @xmath333    @xmath334    the non - monotonic behavior of the exciton size as a function of the coulomb interaction strength is also observed in the small - gap regime .",
    "equation  ( [ excitonradiusfta ] ) shows that @xmath335 will decrease if the diminution of @xmath280 dominates when the lattice parameter @xmath19 increases , but becomes greater if the increase of the velocity @xmath336 and the reduction of the gap @xmath217 prevail ( see sec .",

    "the exciton sizes range from @xmath339 to @xmath123 .",
    "we have found that in all cases our numerical results fulfill the field - theory relation  ( [ excitonradiusftb ] ) within 15% if we use @xmath340 as the charge velocity .",
    "this good agreement shows that our definitions  ( [ howtodefineexcitonsize ] ) and  ( [ excitonradiusft ] ) are mutually consistent in the regime of small mott gaps .",
    "moreover , the numerical method yields reasonable estimates of the exciton size even in the regime where such calculations become laborious .",
    "we have investigated excitons in the optical conductivity spectrum of one - dimensional mott insulators using two new reliable methods , the dynamical density - matrix renormalization group and the field - theoretical form - factor bootstrap approach , supplemented by two established techniques , a strong - coupling analysis and the symmetrized dmrg .",
    "mott - hubbard excitons can be understood with the simple picture of a bound pair of spinless bosonic excitations with opposite charge , in analogy to the bound electron - hole pair of wannier exciton theory .",
    "however , the properties of mott - hubbard excitons are not as simple as those of wannier excitons because both the mott gap and the force between charged excitations originate from the coulomb repulsion between electrons and are thus interdependent .",
    "in particular , the smallness of an exciton binding energy is no indication for the strength of the coulomb repulsion in a mott insulator .",
    "we may compare our results to experiments for polydiacetylene chains in their monomer matrix .",

    "the difference can be attributed to the limitations of this simple calculation or the uncertainty of the order of 20% for the experimental values@xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that our many - body approach can be applied successfully to real polymers .",
    "although the particular model studied here is too simple to describe conjugated polymers accurately , we believe that the concept of mott - hubbard excitons is relevant for these materials as the electron - electron interaction significantly contributes to the formation of their optical gap . in any case , this approach is more realistic than the oversimplified wannier theory and other simple approaches that neglect or minimize the role of electronic correlations in conjugated polymers .",
    "the many - body methods used in this work can be applied ( and in part , have already been applied ) to more realistic models taking into account the polymer geometrical structure and the electron - phonon interaction , and possibly additional perturbations such as interchain couplings .",
