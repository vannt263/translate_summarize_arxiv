    "recently , using the radiative return method @xcite , a new state , the @xmath8 ( also named @xmath10 in the literature ) , was observed in @xmath11 with the dipion invariant mass close to the @xmath12 region , explicitly , for @xmath13 mev @xcite . later on this state",
    "was also detected at bes in the @xmath14 reaction @xcite and belle in @xmath15 @xcite . in an update of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , results on the channel @xmath16 were presented in the form of number of events as a function of the dikaon invariant mass @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this work , the cross section for @xmath17 was measured as a function of the center of mass energy up to @xmath18 and it is shown there that this reaction is dominated by events where one kaon pair comes from the decay of a @xmath19 . selecting events with a kaon pair within @xmath20 of the @xmath19 mass , an enhancement in the invariant mass of the other kaon pair close to threshold is observed and suggested to be due to the @xmath12 tail , but the low statistics and uncertainties in the @xmath21 line shape prevent the authors to present a cross section for @xmath22 using the @xmath23 final state",
    ".    inspired in the physics behind the radiative @xmath24 decay @xcite , a detailed theoretical study of @xmath25 for pions in @xmath26-wave was performed in @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath27 has been also studied in the context of nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the tree level contributions through the @xmath28 mixing are negligible and @xmath25 proceeds through the production of off - shell @xmath29 and @xmath4 pairs , the successive decay of the off - shell kaon or @xmath30 into an on - shell @xmath19 and an off - shell @xmath31 and subsequent @xmath32 scattering .",
    "the starting point was the @xmath2 lagrangian @xcite supplemented with the anomalous term for the @xmath33 interactions .",
    "the corresponding predictions , valid for low virtualities of the exchanged photon and low dipion invariant mass were improved in two respects .",
    "first , the @xmath26-wave @xmath34 amplitudes entering the loop calculations were replaced by the full @xmath34 isoscalar amplitudes as calculated in @xmath5 , which contain the scalar poles @xcite .",
    "second , the lowest order terms of the kaon form factor were replaced by the full kaon form factor as calculated in @xmath5 @xcite which describes satisfactorily the scarce data for energies around @xmath35 @xcite . likewise , the @xmath4 isoscalar transition form factor arising from @xmath2 and the anomalous term , was replaced by the transition form factors as extracted from data on @xmath36 @xcite .    the @xmath12 couples strongly to the @xmath37 system and it should contribute to the mechanisms studied in @xcite in the case of @xmath38 production .",
    "therefore it is worthy to study this channel also .",
    "as discussed above , some experimental data has been released for @xmath16 .",
    "we devote this work to the study of this reaction in the framework developed in ref .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath39 final state , the @xmath23 final state is induced at tree level in this framework .",
    "furthermore , as noticed in @xcite , the @xmath12 pole is close to the threshold for the production of the dikaon system and the loop contributions can be enhanced by this pole thus a complete analysis requires to calculate rescattering contributions . in this concern , we know that the @xmath40 meson couples strongly to the @xmath41 system but not to the @xmath42 system . therefore , in addition to the @xmath12 contributions we also expect contributions from the @xmath40 meson to the @xmath23 final state .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath40 poles lie slightly below @xmath43 , hence their complete shapes are not expected to be seen in this reaction but their respective tails could give visible effects close to the reaction threshold .",
    "contributions from intermediate vector mesons , @xmath44 , are forbidden by charge conjugation .    an important improvement with respect to the formalism used in @xcite",
    "is the more accurate characterization of the @xmath4 form factors .",
    "indeed , recently , the cross section for @xmath45 was precisely measured in the @xmath46 @xmath47 region @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath4 isoscalar and isovector transition form factors as extracted from this data in our analysis instead of the old data from @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we outline the calculation .",
    "results for the tree level contributions to @xmath16 are given in section iii .",
    "in section iv we adapt previous calculations for the rescattering effects in the @xmath48 final state to the @xmath23 final state .",
    "section v is devoted to the extraction of the @xmath4 transitions form factors from data .",
    "in section vi we analyze the different contributions .",
    "section vii is devoted to estimate the intermediate @xmath8 contribution .",
    "our summary and conclusions are given in section viii .",
    "the calculation of the cross section for the @xmath49 reaction is a non - trivial task . indeed , the leading electromagnetic contributions to this reaction are due to a single photon exchange in whose case we need to calculate the @xmath50 vertex function for a hard virtual photon ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is an energy scale far beyond the well grounded calculations based on @xmath52 , its @xmath53 saturated version @xmath54 or even the unitarized formalism , @xmath5 , which is expected to be valid up to energies of the order of @xmath55 ; therefore it is not evident that one can perform reliable calculations at the energy of the reaction .",
    "however , whatever the responsible mechanisms for the reaction be , they must leave their fingerprint at low energies , i.e. for low photon virtualities in the @xmath50 vertex function , which can be calculated using the effective theory for qcd at low energies .",
    "we use this fact to attempt a reasonable calculation of @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath50 vertex function at low photon virtualities using @xmath2 supplemented with the anomalous lagrangian for the @xmath33 interactions . as a result",
    "we obtain the electromagnetic part of the @xmath50 vertex function dominated by form factors while the pure hadronic interactions are within the scope of @xmath2 in the case of tree level contributions and involve the leading order on - shell @xmath52 meson - meson amplitudes in the case of one loop contributions .",
    "these results , valid at low energies are improved using the unitarized kaon form factors ( which account for the scarce experimental data at the energy of the reaction ) and experimental data on the @xmath4 transition form factors .",
    "similarly , the leading order on - shell meson - meson interactions are iterated following @xcite to obtain the unitarized meson - meson amplitudes containing the scalar poles .",
    "we start with the calculation of the tree level contributions to @xmath16 within @xmath2 and consider also intermediate vector meson exchange using the conventional anomalous lagrangian for @xmath33 interactions .",
