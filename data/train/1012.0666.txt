    "an important part of the uncertainties in heavy quark lqcd simulations comes from chiral extrapolations that are needed in order to extrapolate lqcd simulations , performed with larger - than - physical light quark masses , down to the physical point .",
    "recent lqcd studies of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) decay constants , both for @xmath31  @xcite and @xmath39  @xcite , have adopted the one - loop heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory ( hm@xmath4pt ) ( including its partially - quenched and staggered counterparts ) to perform chiral extrapolations .",
    "in particular , the hpqcd collaboration has used the standard continuum chiral expansions through first order but augmented by second- and third - order polynomial terms in @xmath40 where @xmath41 to leading order in @xmath4pt , arguing that the polynomial terms are required by the precision of the data .",
    "it is clear that the nlo hm@xmath4pt alone fails to describe its data .",
    "@xcite has been widely employed not only in extrapolating lqcd simulations but also in phenomenology studies and has been remarkably successful over the decades ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a partial review of early applications ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have argued that a covariant formulation of @xmath4pt may be a better choice for studying heavy - meson phenomenology and lqcd simulations .",
    "this was based on the observation that the counterpart in the su(3 ) baryon sector , heavy baryon @xmath4pt , converges very slowly and often fails to describe both phenomenology and lattice data ( particularly the latter ) , e.g. , in the description of the lattice data for the masses of the lowest - lying baryons  @xcite . on the other hand , covariant baryon @xmath4pt was shown to provide a much improved description of the same data  @xcite . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that for the scattering lengths of light pseudoscalar mesons interacting with @xmath0 mesons , recoil corrections are non - negligible . given the important role played by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in our understanding of strong - interaction physics and the importance of chiral extrapolations in lqcd simulations , it is timely to examine how covariant @xmath4pt works in conjunction with the hpqcd @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) data .    in this letter",
    "we study the light quark mass dependence of the hpqcd @xmath2 and @xmath3 results  @xcite decay constant , it has not done the same for the @xmath2 decay constant , and therefore its @xmath42 ratio remains the same but with a slightly larger uncertainty . for our purposes , it is enough to study the hpqcd 2007 data  @xcite . ] using a covariant formulation of @xmath4pt .",
    "it is not our purpose to reanalyze the raw lqcd data because the hpqcd collaboration has performed a comprehensive study .",
    "repeating such a process using a different formulation of @xmath4pt will not likely yield any significantly different results . instead",
    ", we will focus on their final results in the continuum limit as a function of @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the average of up and down quark masses and @xmath45 the strange quark mass .",
    "these results can be treated as quasi - original lattice data because , for chiral extrapolations , the hpqcd collaboration has used the nlo hm@xmath4pt result plus two polynomials of higher chiral order .",
    "therefore , any inadequacy of the nlo hm@xmath4pt should have been remedied by fine - tuning the two polynomials .",
    "accordingly the extrapolations should be reliable , apart from the fact that the connection with an order - by - order @xmath4pt analysis is lost .",
    "our present work tries to close this gap . using the hpqcd continuum limits as a benchmark instead of the raw data",
    "not only greatly simplifies our analysis but also highlights the most important point we wish to make , namely that the covariant formulation of @xmath4pt is more suitable for chiral extrapolations of lqcd data than the hm@xmath4pt , at least in the present case .",

    "we have introduced a dimensionless coefficient @xmath73 to distinguish the vector and pseudoscalar fields , which is 1 if heavy quark spin symmetry is exact .",
    "we need to stress that in our covariant formulation of @xmath4pt we do not keep track of explicit @xmath5 corrections that break heavy quark spin and flavor symmetry , instead we focus on su(3 ) breaking .",

    "the mass splitting in principle can also depend on the light quark masses but we expect that the dependence of this `` hyperfine '' splitting should be much weaker than that of the @xmath0 mass , @xmath69 , which we discuss below .    at nlo , the following lagrangian is responsible for generating su(3 ) breaking between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses  @xcite : @xmath89 which yields @xmath90 @xmath91 one may implement this mass splitting in two different ways by either using the hpqcd continuum limits on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses  @xcite to fix the three lecs : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , or taking into account only the @xmath83 mass splitting @xmath95 where we have introduced @xmath96 . in the second approach , using the experimental data for @xmath69 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , one obtains @xmath100 .",

    "before presenting the numerical results , we should make it clear that in our present formulation of @xmath4pt we have focused on su(3 ) breaking in the context of the chiral expansions but we have not utilized explicitly heavy quark symmetry that relates the couplings of the @xmath0 mesons with those of the @xmath59 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mesons .    in the present case ,",
    "we encounter three lecs : @xmath62 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . at this point ,",

    "it is clear that the covariant results ( with @xmath119=41 ) are in much better agreement with the hpqcd continuum limits than the hm@xmath4pt results ( with @xmath120 )   as defined here does not have a clear - cut physical meaning .",
    "it only reflects to what extent the chiral results agree with the hpqcd extrapolations . ] .",
    "this is not surprising because as we mentioned earlier the hpqcd collaboration has added second and third order polynomial terms in @xmath121 to perform their extrapolation .",
    "furthermore one can notice that at larger light quark masses the difference between the covariant @xmath4pt and the hm@xmath4pt results becomes larger .",
    "this highlights the importance of using a covariant formulation of @xmath4pt in order to make chiral extrapolations if lattice simulations are performed with relatively large light quark masses .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached in studying the light quark mass dependence of the lowest - lying octet and decuplet baryon masses  @xcite .",

    "the three lecs in the nnlo covariant @xmath4pt have the following values : @xmath125 mev , @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "if we had fitted the hpqcd extrapolations by neglecting the loop contributions , we would have obtained a even better agreement ( @xmath128 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we also found that the lattice baryon mass data could be fitted better with the lo ( linear in @xmath44 ) chiral extrapolation .",
    "but there we found that the nlo chiral results in fact describe the experimental data better than the lo ( linear ) chiral extrapolation .",
    "this just shows that the lattice baryon mass data behave more linearly as a function of light quark masses at large light quark masses and chiral logarithms play a more relevant role at smaller light quark masses , as one naively expects .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath3 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the black lines show the results of the nlo hm@xmath4pt and the blue lines the results of the covariant nlo chpt .",
    "the red lines are the continuum extrapolations of the hpqcd collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath129 is related to the pseudoscalar meson masses at leading chiral order through @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath45 are the physical up , down , and strange quark mass .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    , but the chiral expansions are calculated up to nnlo.[fig2 ] ]    another way of understanding the importance of chiral logarithms is to perform separate fits for lattice simulations obtained at different light quark masses .",
    "one expects that at smaller light quark masses ( e.g. , @xmath136 mev ) covariant @xmath4pt and hm @xmath4pt results should perform more or less similarly . on the other hand ,",
    "if the light quark masses are larger , covariant @xmath4pt should be a better choice . in fig .  4 , we show the fitted results obtained from fitting the hpqcd extrapolations in two different regions of light quark masses , @xmath137 ( left panel ) and @xmath138 ( right panel ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that fitting lattice data with large light quark masses using the hm@xmath4pt results may give unreliable extrapolations .",
    "here we have used the nnlo hm@xmath4pt and covariant @xmath4pt results for comparison .",
    "the difference will become even larger if the nlo @xmath4pt results are used .",
    "we should also mention that even for @xmath137 ( @xmath139 mev ) the hpqcd extrapolations are better described by covariant @xmath4pt than by hm@xmath4pt judging from the @xmath119 analysis ( although the difference is so small that it can hardly be appreciated by just looking at the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2hl ] ) .",
    "we have checked that our covariant results are stable with respect to variations of certain input parameters within reasonable ranges , e.g. , @xmath140 gev and @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the renormalization scale and @xmath106 the @xmath143 coupling defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gddstarpi ] ) . with our standard choice : @xmath144 and @xmath145 gev , we have also noticed that for the nnlo covariant @xmath4pt to produce a smaller @xmath119 than the linear chiral extrapolation , @xmath73 has to be larger than 1.23 . if we use the quenched lqcd result , @xmath146  @xcite , the fit is even better , which is compatible with the result of ref .  @xcite but with larger uncertainties . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "our results remain qualitatively the same with either @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "therefore we have presented the results obtained with @xmath147 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory not only helps extrapolating lqcd simulations to the physical light quark masses .",
    "it also benefits from this process because once the values of the relevant lecs are fixed by fitting the lqcd data , @xmath4pt predicts observables involving the same set of lecs . in the present case , assuming that the @xmath5 corrections to the values of the three lecs @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath106 are small , we can calculate the ratio of @xmath8 by making the following replacements in our nnlo covariant @xmath4pt results : @xmath149 it is found that deviations of @xmath77 and @xmath78 from those determined from the @xmath0(@xmath59 ) mesons affect the @xmath8 ratio only by small amounts .",
