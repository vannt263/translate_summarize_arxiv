    "the application of effective field theory ( eft ) techniques to the study of cosmic inflation , constitutes a powerful and systematic approach through which we can calibrate and account for our ignorance of the laws of physics relevant during the very early universe  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . without a precise knowledge of the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion in which the inflaton and its most relevant decay products ( which must at least contain the standard model ) are embedded",
    ", the eft approach allows us to study the generic predictions of such an embedding on low energy observables .",
    "these predictions take the form of specific form factors and self couplings that weight the terms in the derivative expansion of our eft for all light degrees of freedom .",
    "each set of these couplings represents an equivalence class of uv complete theories which flow to the given effective description valid below the energy scale parametrized by the cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "while it is hard to conceive that one could ever uniquely identify the fundamental theory that gave rise to inflation through the veil of cosmological observations , it is reasonable to suppose that in parametrizing our ignorance through an eft approach , one can substantially narrow down some of its essential features . with the current and upcoming observations on both the cosmic microwave background  @xcite and large scale structure  @xcite promising to provide unprecedentedly accurate data , it is important to understand how these might probe and constrain the relevance of any higher dimensional operators during inflation . as a preface to this ,",
    "it is useful to revisit the conditions under which such operators can become relevant ( if even transiently ) during effectively single field inflation , consistent with slow - roll , the consistency of the eft expansion and the presence of the very hierarchy that separates the scale of inflation from the heavy modes that one has putatively integrated out  @xcite .",
    "consider that the derivative expansion of the eft is an operator expansion weighted by powers of @xmath8 , the scale which defines the separation between heavy and light degrees of freedom .",
    "were we privy to the parent theory before we ve integrated out these heavy modes , we would notice that it is articulated in terms of additional mass scales , which will subsequently manifest in the low energy eft through the couplings that parametrize the derivative expansion .",
    "examples of such additional scales could include the riemann curvature of the target space of the parent theory , as well as those curvature scales that one can derive from the potential and its second derivatives which determine the dynamics of the inflaton .",
    "a particularly pertinent example of the latter is given by @xmath9 , the radius of curvature in field space of the inflaton trajectory in the parent theory . in constructions",
    "representative of inflation realized in a string or a supergravity theory , these additional scales can readily approach the cutoff scale @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is a relevant question to ask how the low energy theory accounts for these additional scales in the couplings that weight the derivative expansion , in a manner that is consistent with the very hierarchy that defines the validity of the derivative expansion . in other words , how do the parameters of the parent theory manifest in the eft expansion ?",
    "the most straightforward way to answer this question , is of course to actually integrate out the heavy modes in the parent theory and study the resulting eft .",
    "however in doing so , one encounters several subtleties .    in the specific context of inflationary cosmology ,",
    "our accounting of the low energy eft of inflation has to remain valid over ranges that accomplish the full 60 odd @xmath10-folds that is minimally required of inflation .",
    "this is a very tall ask , and is perhaps _ the _ challenge for inflationary model building today  @xcite . in many cases",
    ", this could translate into requiring that the eft we write down remain valid over very large excursions in field space ( in units of the planck mass @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "trans - planckian concerns notwithstanding  @xcite , in many circumstances , from the perspective of the parent theory we are forced to account for the other scales present in the system , which turn out to manifest in the low energy eft in an interesting manner .",
    "if for example in the context of single field inflation , were the inflaton trajectory to traverse a sudden in a sense that we shall make precise , if the turn is too `` sudden '' , the eft ceases to be valid  @xcite . by `` turn ''",
    "we specifically mean that the trajectory is not auto - parallel with respect to the sigma model metric , and is parametrized by the radius of curvature in field space @xmath9 , defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the derivative of the potential normal to the background trajectory , evaluated on the trajectory .",
    "] enough turn in field space , one finds that the inflaton will be forced off its adiabatic minimum , in particular cases without even interrupting slow - roll .",
    "this results in the transient strong coupling of certain operators in the eft that are sensitive to the curvature radius of the trajectory @xmath9 , and which reduces the effective speed of sound for the long wavelength quanta of the adiabatic mode @xcite .",
    "in addition to enhancing the primordial bispectrum , this transient strong coupling can imprint features in the power spectrum depending on the specific nature of the trajectory , whereas as we shall see shortly , the enhancement of the bispectrum depends on both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and @xmath9 is the radius of curvature of the background inflaton trajectory . ] .",
    "the latter phenomenon arises only after having mindfully integrated out the fast modes of the theory instead of having truncated them outright .",
    "how much the trajectory deviates off the adiabatic minimum is a function of the mass of the heavy fields which couple to the inflaton , the inflaton velocity ( which must remain consistent with slow - roll ) , and the radius of curvature , @xmath9 , of the trajectory in field space .",
    "our goal in this paper is to elucidate the general structure , to all orders in perturbations , of the eft for the adiabatic mode of a theory described by a single effective scalar minimally coupled to gravity at low energies  a situation that might be dynamically preferred  @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we have to be mindful of the fact that notions of adiabaticity have to be generalized to account for the fact that the motion of the inflaton through field space can readily force it off its adiabatic minimum , without interrupting slow - roll , even as the scale of inflation remains far below the scale of heavy physics @xmath8 , and in spite of which a low energy eft description is available and describes the physics of the light modes to the appropriate accuracy .",
    "we will show that the couplings of the eft are parametrized entirely in terms of the reduced speed of sound @xmath14 , which we compute in terms of the parameters of the parent theory . qualifying the expectation that @xmath14 can at most be a slowly varying function of time  @xcite , or that it can not become too small without violating perturbative unitarity  @xcite , we find that it is entirely consistent to have _ transiently _ small speeds of sound induced by _ transient _",
    "strong couplings of various operators in the eft expansion .",
    "these are readily generated by turns in the parent theory that cause the background inflaton to deviate off its adiabatic minimum . in spite of this , we are still able to write down an effective theory that captures the relevant physics of the adiabatic mode with the appropriate accuracy , which forces us to consider a generalized notion of adiabaticity that determines the validity of our eft .",
    "this generalization is mandated by the fact that there are two distinct ways in which the low energy description accounts for deviations of the inflaton trajectory off its adiabatic minimum in the parent theory .",
    "these can be classed from the perspective of the parent theory , as being due to either :    * _ strong turns _",
    ", where the adjective refers to the degree to which the speed of sound @xmath14 is reduced , which is commensurate with how far off the adiabatic minimum of the potential the background inflaton trajectory is forced by its evolution , or * _ sudden turns _ , where the adjective refers to the rate of change of the speed of sound @xmath15 , induced by changes in the radius of curvature of the trajectory .    from now on , all references to _ strong _ and _ sudden _ will reference these two definitions . each of these has a different scope for being realized consistently in the low energy description",
    ". sustained strong turns ( @xmath17 over several @xmath10-folds of expansion ) are difficult to maintain in tandem with a consistent derivative expansion ( without invoking additional special symmetries )  @xcite .",
    "however within certain limits that we will elaborate upon , sudden turns that are nt too strong ( @xmath18 over a fraction of an @xmath10-fold ) can readily and consistently generate transient strong ( but not too strong ) couplings in the eft  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "in addition , the nature of the turn thus classified results in identifiably distinct contributions to observables : a strong turn for example , can reduce the speed of sound of the adiabatic mode , but for a constant radius of curvature , serves to only renormalize the power spectrum whilst generating equilateral non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "sudden turns on the other hand can generate features in the power spectrum  @xcite as well various non - trivial shapes in the bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "the positive detection of these observables would allow us to infer non - trivial information about the eft in which inflation is embedded .",
    "although multi - field inflation models have been thoroughly studied during the past decade , it has only recently been realized that multi - field scenarios in which the masses of extra fields remain much larger than the rate of expansion possess a non - trivial single - field limit  @xcite beyond the standard slow - roll paradigm , the hubble factor during inflation .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an eft approach to multi - field inflation when the extra fields are light . ] . in this limit ,",
    "high frequency modes ( set by some mass scale @xmath19 ) are irrelevant and any heavy fields act as spectators that only effect the low energy dynamics by inducing non - trivial higher dimensional interactions for the inflaton , appropriately weighted by powers of @xmath8 .",
    "these higher dimensional operators have a variety of consequences such as reducing the speed of sound of adiabatic perturbations  @xcite , generating large levels of primordial non - gaussianity in the limit @xmath20  @xcite , in addition to generating features in the power spectrum that pass the threshold of being potentially observable  @xcite .",
    "in what follows we attempt to further our understanding of the structure of the single field effective theory derived from parent theories with a single light inflaton among multiple other fields with masses much larger than the scale of inflation . by analyzing the terms of the derivative expansion that emerge from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom ,",
    "we show that the speed of sound @xmath14 for the adiabatic perturbations emerges as _ the _ salient book - keeping device around which successive terms in the derivative expansion naturally organize themselves .",
    "this reduced speed of sound will be a functional of the background inflaton trajectory , itself dependent on the field geometry and the multi - field potential .",
    "specifically , we implement the integration of heavy fields through a generalization of the framework introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study cosmological perturbations in general frw backgrounds ( applied to inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the goldstone boson corresponding to broken time translational invariance is identified with the adiabatic mode of our system , now consisting of our multi - field parent theory minimally coupled to gravity . to pare down the discussion to its physical essentials",
    ", we consider the parent theory to consist of a canonical two - field system , where a hierarchy of scales between the masses of the two fields persists along the entire inflationary trajectory . as we discuss shortly ,",
    "the treatment that follows straightforwardly extends to more general parametrizations of the parent theory . by explicitly integrating out the heavy modes , we are able to deduce an effective theory valid to all orders in field perturbations , allowing us to identify the operators which become relevant enough to imprint on the cosmological observables within the threshold of observational sensitivity .",
    "it is worth emphasizing a few key points before we commence our analysis :    * as a corollary of diffeomorphism invariance , the parent multi - field theory possesses a time translational invariance that is broken on general cosmological backgrounds .",
    "it follows that all fluctuations around this background that can be gauged away by a local time reparametrization the so called adiabatic modes can thus be related to the nambu - goldstone boson ( or goldstone boson for short ) corresponding to this broken symmetry . *",
    "given that the action for the goldstone boson is forced to be invariant under shift symmetries  @xcite , one can identify the structure of the derivative expansion in the resulting effective theory . specifically ,",
    "the requirement that constant solutions exist to all orders ( even after having integrated out the heavy fields that couple to the goldstone mode ) , constrains the terms that can appear in its derivative expansion .",
    "this is the legacy of the broken time translation invariance , passed down from the parent theory to the eft .",
    "the goldstone boson of broken time translational invariance of the parent theory , in conforming with convention is denoted @xmath21 , and is readily identified with the one introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and specifically applied to inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite , after we integrate out the heavy fields that couple to it . * the relevant quantity which naturally organizes the various terms in the eft expansion order by order turns out to be the speed of sound @xmath14 of the adiabatic mode . after integrating out the heavy modes ,",
    "all relevant couplings can be expressed in terms of @xmath14 , in a manner that can be distinguished from other theories whose primary feature is a reduced speed of sound , such as dbi inflation  @xcite or general @xmath22 theories  @xcite . *",
    "contrary to the naive expectation that suggests that in the slow - roll limit @xmath23 these couplings must vary slowly in time , we show that their variation can be considerably large if the inflaton trajectory deviates from a geodesic ( i.e. turns ) sufficiently strongly or suddenly .",
    "this allows for certain operators in the eft expansion that one might have previously neglected to become transiently strongly coupled , consistent with perturbative unitarity and the consistency of our derivative expansion , in a way that can imprint features on the primordial power spectrum  @xcite due to the induced variations of the speed of sound .",
    "in particular , it is easy to infer from the eft that sufficiently rapid variation of these couplings will necessarily introduce cubic derivative interactions for the goldstone mode , implying correlated non - gaussian signatures in the primordial bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "the above realizations straightforwardly extend beyond the parametrization of the parent theory examined in this study , so long as the original theory respects diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "in particular , although we have chosen to work with a canonical two - scalar field model for the benefit of clarity , our treatment is carried out in a geometrically covariant language which allows our results to easy extend to more general setups involving more than two fields or a non - trivial sigma model metric : through field redefinitions , one can always work in a basis where one transforms away the sigma model metric at the expense of introducing derivative interactions ( and corrections to the potential ) , which are easily accounted for .",
    "we organize our investigation as follows : in section  [ minkowski ] we discuss the simple example of a two - field model in minkowski spacetime , where the scalar fields break time translation by acquiring time - dependent expectation values .",
    "this example exhibits in an uncomplicated setting , all of the essential features that are found in the more complicated setup where gravity must be accounted for . in particular , we will show how time translation symmetry of the full theory imposes strong constraints on the non - perturbative structure of the eft deduced by integrating out the heavy degree of freedom .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : multi - field ] we move on to study the more involved case of two scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "there , we derive the action for multi - field perturbations in two different gauges : the comoving gauge , where the adiabatic perturbation is readily expressed in terms of the gauge invariant field @xmath24 , and the flat gauge , where the goldstone boson @xmath25 takes the leading role in describing adiabatic perturbations . in section  [ sec : eft ] we explicitly integrate out the heavy field and deduce the efts in both gauges . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we proceed to discuss the validity of the resulting effective theories , and examine some of their salient features .",
    "we compare our results with previous work and discuss its ramifications for future observations , after which we offer our concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "it turns out that most of the essential features encountered in the context of inflationary cosmology are already present in the much simpler setup of scalar field dynamics on minkowski spacetime .",
    "although such a setup ignores gravity , many of the structures inherent to perturbation theory around inflationary backgrounds are due to symmetries that are already present on minkowski spacetimes .",
    "thus for conceptual clarity , we warm up with this example before coupling our system to gravity .",
    "but our analysis is straightforwardly extendable to include additional fields .",
    "consider the following action @xmath26 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the @xmath27-index labels the two fields .",
    "this action has the property of being invariant under space - time translations @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant vector . in other words , by defining @xmath30 , we trivially recover the same action , but with @xmath31 in place of @xmath32 .",
    "the equations of motion that result from ( [ original - action - minkowski ] ) are @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "there is a particular set of background solutions @xmath35 that preserve spatial translations but spontaneously break the time translation symmetry of the original action .",
    "these solutions are homogeneous and isotropic in the reference frame given by @xmath36 , and satisfy the following equation of motion : @xmath37 we now consider a few corollaries resulting from the time translational symmetry of the original action . assuming that we have a solution to ( [ minkowski - eq - of - motion - background ] ) of the form @xmath38 with given boundary conditions , then because the invariance of the action under finite time translations @xmath39",
    ", one can generate a family of non - trivial solutions @xmath40 out of @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant of our choice .",
    "of course , a similar relation must hold for the initial conditions , fixed at time @xmath44 : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , while it is true that @xmath47 spontaneously breaks time translational invariance , the generator of the broken symmetry can be used to produce a one parameter family of solutions @xmath48 from the base solution @xmath49 .",
    "this seemingly inane observation turns out to have far reaching consequences for the perturbative expansion of the system .      before jumping into the intricacies of perturbation theory , we briefly review some useful geometrical background identities and fix our notation . a given background solution",
    "@xmath49 defines a trajectory in field space parameterized by time @xmath50 .",
    "it is therefore natural to define the tangent vector @xmath51 to the trajectory as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rapidity of the scalar field s vacuum expectation value .",
    "differentiating @xmath54 with respect to time , we get @xmath55 , from which one obtains the projection of equation of motion of the scalar field ( [ minkowski - eq - of - motion - background ] ) along the trajectory @xmath56 where we use the notation @xmath57 . since we are dealing with a two - field system , we may also define a unit vector @xmath58 normal to the trajectory , _ i.e. _ @xmath59 . to define it in a unique manner ,",
    "it is enough to write the normal as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the totally antisymmetric @xmath62 matrix with unit entries .",
    "this choice fixes the orientation of @xmath63 with respect to the trajectory .",
    "given the pair @xmath64 and @xmath63 , we may now _ define _ an angular velocity @xmath65 for the trajectory as @xmath66 because we work in a two - dimensional field space , it is easy to show that @xmath67 moreover , by projecting the equation of motion ( [ minkowski - eq - of - motion - background ] ) along @xmath63 , it is possible to derive an identity determining @xmath65 in terms of the slope of the potential @xmath68 along the normal direction  @xcite @xmath69 this tells us that as soon as the trajectory is subject to a turn , the background scalar field deviates off the adiabatic minimum of the potential , defined by @xmath70 .",
    "the relative sign between @xmath71 and @xmath72 follows the geometrical intuition that the turning trajectory will be displaced onto the outer slope of the valley of the potential whenever a turn takes place .",
    "the background parameter @xmath73 will play an important role in what follows .",
    "t0.5        we now consider perturbations around the background solution @xmath74 .",

    "notice that @xmath25 represents deviations from @xmath74 exactly along the path defined by the background solution , whereas @xmath80 parametrizes deviations off the trajectory , but evaluated at @xmath79 . in fact , the field @xmath80 lives in the tangent space @xmath81 spanned by @xmath77 .    before determining the action for the perturbations in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath80",
    ", we can already anticipate certain features of it to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "since @xmath82 with @xmath43 an arbitrary constant is also a solution of the system ( provided that the initial conditions are set appropriately ) , it follows that there must be a non - trivial solution for the set of fields @xmath25 , @xmath80 such that @xmath83 this can be done by setting @xmath25 to be constant everywhere on some initial hypersurface with @xmath84 .",
    "given the existence of this solution , along with the spatial and rotational invariance of the background solution , one finds that the interactions of the theory written in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath80 are greatly constrained . for example",
    ", we can anticipate that the lagrangian for @xmath25 and @xmath80 is allowed to contain cubic interactions of the form @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , but can not contain interactions proportional to @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 simply because the latter do not lead to equations of motions for which ( [ particular - non - trivial - solution - mink ] ) is a solution .",
    "moreover , for the particular case of long wavelength perturbations , where spatial derivatives of @xmath25 can be ignored , we can immediately infer that one of the two linearly independent solutions to the equations of motion must be @xmath94 constant .",
    "a further corollary that follows from the existence of solution ( [ particular - non - trivial - solution - mink ] ) is relevant for when we eventually integrate out @xmath80 . if we linearize the equation of motion for @xmath95 but keep @xmath25 to all orders , on general grounds it will be of the form : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a general linear operator acting on @xmath80 which may include couplings that depend on @xmath25 . on the other hand",

    "this is because the configuration @xmath99constant and @xmath100 must be a solution of the system .",
    "therefore , if we define @xmath101 as the result of letting @xmath102 act on a constant , @xmath103 the integration of @xmath80 can be symbolically expressed ( with the provision of appropriate boundary conditions ) as @xmath104 \\pi \\left(\\pi , \\dot \\pi , \\delta\\pi\\right ) \\",

    "this expansion is only convergent at energy scales much smaller than @xmath8 , which therefore defines the cutoff scale for the resulting eft .",

    "consequently , the resulting eft for @xmath25 will inherit the property that @xmath99constant is a solution of the system , due to the original symmetry of the parent multi - field theory .",

    "@xcite the mass scales @xmath281 represent the couplings determining the expansion of the eft action in powers of @xmath284 in the comoving gauge . to compare their formalism with our results ,",
    "it is enough to expand the effective action ( [ action - goldstone - full-2 ] ) in powers of @xmath285 and subsequently identify the coefficients of the expansion with @xmath281 as : @xmath286 that is , to leading order in @xmath126 _ all of the higher dimensional operators of the effective theory are uniquely characterized by the speed of sound @xmath14_. given that for @xmath287 the perturbative expansion contains non - renormalizable terms , we must be weary of strong coupling effects that might affect the validity of eft .",
    "indeed , the strong coupling scale @xmath288 is determined by @xmath289 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on this ) and therefore we may demand that @xmath290 for comparison , we notice that in ref .  @xcite the scale of new physics @xmath291 coincides with our definition of @xmath279 .",
    "if this condition is respected , the eft is valid all the way up to energies below our reference scale @xmath279 , before entering the strong coupling regime .",
    "notice that this condition imposes restrictions on how small @xmath14 may become for a certain fixed value of the effective mass @xmath279 .",
    "because the speed of sound already depends on the effective mass ( through the relation @xmath292 ) we may alternatively write this condition as a constraint between the angular velocity @xmath65 and the @xmath279 : @xmath293    also , it is interesting to notice that ( [ m - n - eft ] ) represents a specific prediction of the present type of theories that might be contrasted with other models of effective single field inflation .",
    "for example , we observe that the mass scales @xmath294 and @xmath295 are related as @xmath296 which may be compared to the result found for dbi inflation , where these scales are related through @xmath297 equation ( [ eq : m2-m3 multi - field ] ) provides a means of discriminating the class of models we ve considered with other models of single field inflation with a lowered speed of sound for the effective action we derived agrees with that for dbi inflation . ] .",
    "it gives the main contribution to the bispectrum .",
    "if the speed of sound is suppressed , these couplings generically predict  @xcite @xmath298 where the main contributions come from the operators @xmath299 and @xmath85 which are precisely combinations of @xmath294 and @xmath295 .    finally , it is worth emphasizing that the form of the eft ( [ eft - cheung ] ) provided in ref .",
    "@xcite assumes that background quantities vary slowly compared to @xmath170 . from the multi - field point of view , however , this is not the only relevant timescale determining the evolution of the background . in particular , @xmath279 also plays a relevant role as it dictates the frequency of heavy oscillations about the flat minima offered by the scalar potential in charge of producing inflation .",
    "the fact that turns can happen suddenly without violating slow - roll , but remaining within the regime of validity offered by the adiabaticity condition ( [ adiabat - cond - speed ] ) allows for situations in which terms proportional to @xmath15 appearing in the effective theory may become relevant , and can not be disregarded  @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what happens in ( [ eft - action - pi - inflation ] ) , where couplings discarded in ( [ eft - cheung ] ) do indeed appear will be contributions of new shapes to the bispectrum .",
    "we note in this regard , the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of general non - canonical models . ] .",
    "we will discuss the consequences of this observation for the primordial bispectrum in a future report .",
    "the effective field theory approach is a powerful organizing principle whose application to inflation  @xcite is expected to become an important tool in the comparison of theoretical models with observation . in this paper",
    "we have attempted to clarify the non - perturbative structure of effective field theories resulting from the integration of heavy fields in multi - field models with a single light field , the inflaton , and a large mass hierarchy .    in the particularly simple case of two - field models",
    ", we have found that the couplings of the effective field theory are given entirely in terms of the background solution for the speed of sound @xmath130 as a function of time ( dependent on the background trajectory @xmath300 ) .",
    "this result holds to all orders in the perturbative expansion and is inheritance of the time translation invariance of the parent theory , passed down to the effective theory .",
    "as might be expected , it results in relations between the @xmath301-point functions that furthermore , are distinguishable from other models of effective single field inflation , for example dbi inflation .",
    "although the parent theory we analysed is a two - field model with canonical kinetic terms , our approach is fully covariant and we foresee no difficulty in extending the results to arbitrary sigma model metrics in field space  @xcite .",
    "other generalizations are expected to be more involved . in the case of multi - field models where more than one heavy field is integrated out",
    ", we might expect the appearance of other mass scales in the eft .",
    "for instance , the iterative relations ( [ eq : m2-m3 multi - field ] ) would not be so simple .",
    "we would like to stress that some the main features of the derived eft , such as the emergence of a reduced speed of sound and the timescales involved can be understood in a purely minkowski context , where the treatment of decoupling and the integration of the heavy degrees of freedom is much more tractable .",
    "therefore , departures to any of the aforementioned simplifications assumed in this work may first be addressed in minkowski spacetimes .",
    "we are particularly interested in the regime of validity of the eft and its ability to describe departures from the usual notions of adiabaticity that were formulated for effective theories in time independent contexts . in this respect , it is useful to distinguish between `` strong '' turns , with a reduced speed of sound that varies relatively slowly ( for instance , due to a fast but constant rate of turning ) and `` sudden '' turns with a fast changing speed of sound ( as in a sharp , sudden turn in the trajectory ) . in the case of strong turns , where the speed of sound is suppressed , we find that previous arguments constraining the validity of the eft theory apply  @xcite , and the eft remains valid and accurate as long as @xmath302 .",
    "sudden turns on the other hand , present another aspect of the departure from adiabaticity that may render the eft invalid  @xcite in particular limits . for this case",
    ", the approach from the parent theory allows for a detailed understanding of the general adiabaticity conditions that underly the validity of the eft , and are in fact less restrictive than has been previously assumed  @xcite .",
    "when these generalized adiabatic conditions are met , the eft is corrected by terms involving the rate of change of the speed of sound .",
    "these appear in the perturbative expansion at cubic order and were given in section  [ sec : eft ] .",
    "the generalized eft presented here reduces to that of ref .",
    "@xcite for a nearly constant speed of sound and incorporates the dominant corrections due to a sudden turn .",
    "our computation extends the quadratic order analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to all orders in the perturbations .",
    "the limit of strong but constant turns gives a concrete realization of the arguments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the breakdown of the eft when the speed of sound is strongly reduced , signaling new physics ( which in the present case translates in the excitation of heavy modes ) .",
