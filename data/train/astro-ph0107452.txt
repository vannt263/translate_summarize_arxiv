    "the spatial abundance of distant clusters and its redshift evolution constrain cosmological parameters . for cosmological studies ,",
    "however , sample completeness with well - defined selection functions is required .",
    "one of the cleanest way to avoid sample contamination is the selection of high redshift clusters by means of their x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray surveys are sensitive enough to detect objects at redshifts of order unity ( e.g. ms1054@xmath503 at z@xmath60.83 , gioia & luppino 1994 ; rxj1716.6 + 6708 at z@xmath60.81 , gioia et al . 1999 ; rxj0848.9 + 4452 at @xmath7 , rosati et al . 1999 ; cl j1226.9 + 3332 at @xmath8 , ebeling et al .",
    "2001 ) . at these high redshifts some evolution",
    "is expected in the look - back time that approaches half the age of the universe .",
    "today all the determinations of the cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) derived from existing surveys are in agreement for low redshifts ( @xmath9 ) and for low luminosities ( l@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ) indicating no evolution .",
    "there is no unanimous opinion yet regarding the most luminous and most distant clusters known , but results in favor of evolution are accumulating .",
    "the first evidence for negative evolution came from the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia et al . 1990a ; stocke et al . 1991 ; maccacaro et al .",
    "1994 ) and was discussed in terms of the cluster xlf ; the volume density of high redshift , high luminosity clusters is smaller than for nearby objects ( gioia et al . 1990b ; henry et al . 1992 ) . in the past",
    "several results seemed at odds with the emss evolution s claim .",
    "however , these were made without remembering that only the high luminosity end of the xlf was claimed to evolve , a regime where the supposedly contradictory studies had no data .    in this contribution",
    "i present additional evidence regarding the evolution of the cluster population based on the rosat all - sky survey observations around the north ecliptic pole region ( nep ) .",
    "i use h@xmath11  50 km s@xmath4 mpc @xmath4 and q@xmath11  0.5 throughout .",
    "the rosat nep survey covers a @xmath12 region of the deepest area of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; trmper et al . 1991 ;",
    "voges et al .",
    "1999 ) where the scan circles converge and the effective exposure time approaches @xmath13 ks .",
    "details on the rosat nep survey and the x - ray data can be found in henry et al .",
    "2001 and voges et al .",
    "the main difference between the nep survey and the existing x - ray serendipitous cluster surveys is that the nep survey is both deep ( median flux limit is f@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 ) and covers a contiguous area of sky ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus the nep rosat survey database can be used to examine large - scale structure in the distribution of clusters and other classes of extragalactic x - ray sources ( e.g. , agn ) .",
    "a concentration of 21 groups and clusters was indeed found during the analysis of the nep sources ( see mullis et al .",
    "a total of 445 x - ray sources were detected with flux determinations @xmath16 in the @xmath17 kev band using the rass - ii processing .",
    "all but two sources in the survey have been spectroscopically identified and redshifts have been measured for the extragalactic population . a complete and unbiased sample of 64 galaxy clusters has been extracted .",
    "nineteen clusters have a redshift greater than 0.3 with the highest at z@xmath60.81 .",
    "in the course of identifying sources from the x - ray nep survey , several serendipitous discoveries were made .",
    "i mention here the beautifully extended cluster rxj1716 + 67 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , one among the most distant ( z@xmath60.81 ) x@xmath5ray selected clusters so far published with a large number of spectroscopically determined cluster member velocities ( see gioia et al .",
    "the integral number counts of galaxy clusters are a well established means to verify reliability of sky coverage and completeness of identifications . in fig .",
    "3 , in addition to the nep data , the observed cumulative number counts derived from the 160 deg@xmath18 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) , the bcs ( ebeling et al . 1997 ) , the warps ( jones et al . 1998 ) , the s - sharc ( burke et al . 2001 ) , the rdcs ( rosati et al . 1998 ) , and the rass1-bs ( de grandi et al . 1999 ) are shown .",
    "the nep cluster number counts are in agreement within the errors with all the other independent determinations , giving us confidence that our sample is complete .",
    "the number of observed clusters in the nep survey has been compared to the number of expected clusters , assuming no - evolution models .",
    "the three local luminosity functions derived from the rass1 ( de grandi et al . 1999 ) , reflex ( bhringer et al . 1998 ) and",
    "bcs ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ) have been folded through the nep sky coverage and then integrated in the appropriate redshift and luminosity ranges .",
    "the ranges of integration were @xmath20 and @xmath21 in redshift , and @xmath22 erg s@xmath4 in luminosity ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "for the @xmath20 redshift range , the number of clusters expected from the three local samples and observed in the nep are consistent , with the the significance of difference equal to @xmath23 . for the @xmath21 range a value of 65.5 clusters",
    "is expected according to the rass1 , a value of 55.9 according to the reflex and a value of 44.2 according to the bcs .",
    "only 19 nep clusters are observed in the same redshift and luminosity ranges .",
    "the significance of deviation is 6.4@xmath2 , 7.2@xmath2 or 4.7@xmath2 depending on which of the three local xlf sample determinations is considered .",
    "there is a deficit of clusters at l@xmath24 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath0 compared to expectations from a non - evolving xlf ( see fig . 4 for a plot of the nep xlf and three local xlfs .",
    ") this result goes in the same direction as the evolution derived from the emss survey .",
    "the rosat nep survey detects clusters up to z@xmath60.81 .",
    "there is a deficit of clusters at high redshifts and high luminosity compared to expectations from a non - evolving xlf .",
    "five out of six surveys now find evolution .",
    "the original emss ( gioia et al . 1990b ; henry et al . 1992 ) , 160 deg@xmath18 ( vikhlinin et al . 1998 ) , sharc ( nichol et al . 1999 ) , rdcs ( rosati et al . 2000 ) and nep ( gioia et al . 2001 ) surveys are reporting negative evolution at varying levels of significance from @xmath25 1@xmath2 to greater than 5@xmath2 .",
    "the only x - ray survey that does not find negative evolution is the warps ( jones et al .",
    "2000 ; ebeling et al .",
    "evidence is thus accumulating in favor of evolution at the high luminosity end of the xlf at high redshift .",
    "the essentially complete identification rate of the nep survey gives us confidence that the deficit of clusters seen is not due to the fact that clusters have been missed . until larger and better characterized samples are available",
    ", the results presented in this contribution represent the state of the art with respect to evolution of high redshift , high x - ray luminosity clusters .",
