    "this year s cover illustration shows the boundary layer separation from a light sphere rising in quiescent water at high reynolds number . the wake structure behind the sphere is visualized with the schlieren technique .",
    "the experiment is part of a project to study wake structures behind falling and rising spherical particles in a large range of reynolds numbers .",
    "+   + in the past years extensive numerical investigations @xcite have established how the wake of a sphere held _ fixed _ in a uniform flow undergoes a series of transitions as the reynolds number @xmath0 is increased . here @xmath1 is the free stream velocity , @xmath2 the diameter of the sphere , and @xmath3 the kinematic viscosity of the water .",
    "it was found that the wake is axially symmetric up to @xmath4 . above this value a planar - symmetric wake is found that consists of two steady counter - rotating threads . at @xmath5 there is a further transition and the planar - symmetric flow becomes time - dependent : opposite - signed streamwise vortices then form a series of loops that resemble hairpin vortices . as the reynolds number",
    "is further increased , the flow gradually becomes more irregular and finally turbulent .",
    "the digital particle image velocimetry ( dpiv ) measurements by brcker @xcite and the flow visualization studies by schouveiler & provansal @xcite have confirmed most of these numerical results and have further elucidated the sequence of transitions .    for _ freely _ moving spheres the reynolds number",
    "is defined by the measured _",
    "mean _ velocity of rise or fall of the sphere @xmath6 and the corresponding ` reynolds number ' becomes @xmath7 .",
    "mean _ velocity is the time averaged velocity of the sphere , not including the acceleration of the sphere from rest .",
    "the flow looses its axial symmetry at a critical reynolds number which is not significantly affected by the density ratio @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9=211.9 for @xmath10 ( i.e. sphere held fixed ) , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "this is in good agreement with , for example , the experimental results on solid spheres @xcite , on surface - contaminated gas bubbles @xcite , and on wake visualizations in experiments with drops of tetrachloride and chlorobenzene falling in water @xcite . as pointed out by natarajan & acrivos @xcite ,",
    "these drops must have behaved effectively as solid spheres due to presence of surface - active impurities , and these visualizations have therefore often served as a basis of comparison with numerical studies on fixed spheres .",
    "what happens for _ freely _ falling or rising spheres at higher reynolds number , which is more common in multiphase flow applications ?",
    "how are the wake structures and transitions observed for the fixed sphere case modified ?",
    "is there a ( clear ) difference in wake structure between rising and falling spheres ? in this paper we present flow visualizations of the wakes behind freely moving solid spheres at large reynolds number ( @xmath15 ) for which the density ratio @xmath8 is in the range 0.50 to 2.63 .",
    "+    the flow visualizations of the sphere wakes were carried out in a transparent tank ( 0.15 x 0.15 x 0.5 m@xmath16 ) filled with decalcified water .",
    "smooth plastic spheres with diameters between 1.5 mm and 10 mm and densities between 500 kg / m@xmath16 and 2781 kg / m@xmath16 were released from rest . by means of an optical system consisting of two led - lights , pinholes , lenses and mirrors , two perpendicular images of the particle and its wake",
    "were created and recorded at 500 frames / s with a ccd - camera ( figure [ setupfig1 ] ) .",
    "hence , each image consists of two perpendicular views of the same sphere .",
    "the images are taken at a position in the transparent tank where the spheres do not accelerate anymore .",
    "the wake was visualized using the schlieren technique . to this end a small vertical temperature gradient in the water was maintained ( 1 k / cm . ) .",
    "mean _ water temperature at the measurement section was 302 k , with corresponding values of the density ( @xmath17 ) and viscosity ( @xmath18 ) of 996 kg / m@xmath16 and 0.802@xmath1910@xmath20 m@xmath21/s , respectively .",
    "hence , the reynolds number is based on the _ mean _ viscosity and is defined as @xmath22 .",
    "it turned out to be difficult to keep a constant temperature gradient .",
    "therefore the error in the _ mean _ water temperature at the measurement section is about 3 k , leading to a relative error in the viscosity of 10 % . as opposed to the fixed - sphere problem , the reynolds number for freely moving spheres is not an independent parameter . following jenny _",
    "@xcite we choose as independent dimensionless variables the ratio @xmath23 of the densities and the galileo number @xmath24 since @xmath25 can be considered as a velocity scale , @xmath26 plays a similar dynamical role as the free - stream reynolds number in the case of fixed sphere .",
    "the parameter values for which we made the flow visualizations are summarized in table 1 .",

    "<S> this paper presents results from a flow visualization study of the wake structures behind solid spheres rising or falling freely in liquids under the action of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> these show remarkable differences to the wake structures observed behind spheres held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the two parameters controlling the rise or fall velocity ( i.e. , the reynolds number ) are the density ratio between sphere and liquid and the galileo number . </S>"
