    "the spiral phase plate is an important element in modern optics because it can impart well - defined orbital angular momentum to any photon which it reflects or transmits @xcite .",
    "spiral phase plates are widely employed as mode selectors , in active cavities @xcite , as etalons @xcite and in free space @xcite ; in the rotation of microparticles @xcite and nanomechanical elements @xcite ; in microscopy @xcite ; in astronomy @xcite ; and in tests of quantum mechanics @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , a ray transfer matrix has not yet been presented for the spiral phase element .",
    "such a treatment is desirable , since , as is well known , the ray matrix provides an insightful and useful description of most basic optical elements .",
    "thus , ray matrix analyses of mirrors and lenses , of optical resonator stability , and of fiber waveguiding can be found in several optics textbooks @xcite .",
    "there is also a practical need for a spiral phase plate ray matrix , so that ray optics can be extended to systems that integrate spiral phase plates with standard optical components @xcite , without necessitating recourse to the more complicated wave - optical diffraction theory .",
    "a description of the effect of a spiral phase plate on light rays has been presented earlier @xcite , highlighting the role of orbital angular momentum transfer , but without reference to a ray transfer matrix .    in this article",
    "we derive a ray matrix which describes the reflection of light rays from a spiral phase plate carrying an azimuthal gradient as well as a radial curvature .",
    "we use the matrix to find the stability condition for a resonator made of two spiral phase plates .",
    "this spiral resonator is the rotational analog of the standard spherical mirror fabry - perot @xcite , and has been discussed earlier in the literature in the context of laser physics @xcite and optomechanics @xcite .",
    "we provide a simple analytical criterion for resonator stability , which reduces to the standard expression for a spherical mirror cavity in the absence of azimuthal structure on the phase plates .",
    "we also use the derived matrix to trace stable ray orbits in the spiral resonator .",
    "a spiral phase plate is an optical element whose thickness increases linearly with the azimuthal angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the plate is characterized by the step discontinuity of height @xmath0 , and the local pitch angle @xmath1 at the radial coordinate @xmath2 given by @xcite @xmath3 for the purpose of this study , the center of the plate will be placed on the optical axis .",
    "further , only the paraxial approximation will be considered , in which light rays make small angles to the optic axis @xcite .",
    "thus we will assume that @xmath4 in turn , this implies that @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , we will only consider rays impinging far away from the center of the spiral phase plate .",
    "in addition to the azimuthal gradient described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pitch ] ) we will also assume that the spiral phase plate has a radial gradient like an ordinary ( concave ) spherical mirror , characterized by a radius of curvature @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of this curvature is essential for ensuring the stability of the spiral phase plate resonator described below , and also allows us to relate our analysis to the standard results of ray optics theory for @xmath7",
    "to obtain the ray transfer matrix for the spiral phase plate , we begin with a wavefront aberration approach @xcite . since the plate presents a nonorthogonal optical system @xcite , the ray is represented by a four - dimensional vector .",
    "we define this vector as @xmath8 with the first two entries denoting the radial position and inclination respectively with respect to the optic @xmath9 axis , and the last two signifying the corresponding azimuthal quantities .",
    "the ray transfer matrix is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radial matrix and @xmath12 is the tangential matrix .",
    "( [ eq : rad])-([eq : tan ] ) , @xmath13 is the wave front aberration for an optical element , defined as the deviation from an arbitrary reference plane perpendicular to the optic axis @xcite . for the spiral phase plate , we find @xmath14 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mcs])-([eq : wab ] ) , we arrive at @xmath15 although the wavefront aberration formalism has been used since it is general and compact , the matrix @xmath16 can be readily derived by using geometric ray diagrams and snell s law for reflection in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 planes respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) , in the usual textbook manner .",
    "it is important to note that unlike most ray matrices described in textbooks , the matrix @xmath16 is inhomogeneous , meaning that it depends on the ray coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this dependence underlines the fact that the ray reflection from the spiral phase plate is inherently nonlinear , similar to the case of optical elements with coma or spherical aberration , for example @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous ray transfer matrices can nevertheless be useful for analyzing resonator stability , as shown for the bessel - gauss resonator @xcite , and for accurate ray - tracing @xcite .",
    "similarly , we analyze below the stability of a spiral phase plate resonator using the matrix @xmath16 and trace some of the stable ray orbits .    for the following analysis , it is convenient to transform the ray transfer matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cylcoord ] ) to cartesian coordinates . using the well known relations @xmath21 we can calculate the derivatives @xmath22 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cylcart])-([eq : diff ] ) , we transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : cylcoord ] ) to read @xmath23 where we have used @xmath24 and @xmath25 etc .",
    "the determinant of @xmath26 is one , indicating that the plate is lossless .",
    "note however that , unlike the usual non - orthogonal ray transfer matrices in the literature , the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) is not symplectic , namely , it does not satisfy the condition @xmath27 for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the identity matrix and , for the ray - vector ordering used here , @xmath30 the symplecticity condition guarantees not only the conservation of tendue , but also ensures that any incident two - parameter normal congruence of rays ( i.e. , rays that are normal to a family of wavefronts ) emerges also as a normal congruence .",
    "however , this condition as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : symplectic ] ) is only valid for homogeneous matrices @xmath31 , that is , for _ linear _ ray mappings . for more general ray mappings",
    "it is not @xmath26 that must be symplectic , but the jacobian matrix of the final ray parameters @xmath32 with respect to the initial ray parameters @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( note that , for a homogeneous ray matrix @xmath31 , this jacobian matrix does reduce to @xmath31 itself . )",
    "the jacobian matrix is symplectic if the following conditions are satisfied @xcite : @xmath36 it can be readily verified that these conditions are satisfied for the matrix @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) .",
    "we now consider , as an application of the transfer matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) , the stability of a resonator made of two spiral phase plates separated by a distance @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .    .",
    "the steps of the plates have been aligned . ]    for simplicity , we assume that the two spiral phase plates are identical .    to apply the inhomogeneous ray matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) to the spiral phase plate resonator , we consider a situation where @xmath26 becomes effectively homogeneous .",
    "this can be accomplished if @xmath19 assumes a fixed value @xmath2 , i.e. , if the rays always strike the two plates at the same distance from the optic axis .",
    "a self - consistent and stable ray optics solution can indeed be found for this case , as we now show . to calculate the resonator stability , we begin with a light ray just to the left of the plate @xmath38 , and propagate it towards @xmath39 by a distance @xmath37 using the matrix @xcite @xmath40 subsequent reflection of the ray from the plate @xmath39 at the radial point @xmath2 is modeled by the matrix @xmath26 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) ] .",
    "the light ray then travels back to plate @xmath38 , again propagated by the matrix @xmath41 finally , the ray is reflected at the radial coordinate @xmath2 , by plate @xmath38 .",
    "it is therefore multiplied by @xmath42 which can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartm ] ) .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath0 is opposite for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , although the two plates have the same winding , because they face each other .",
    "the resulting round trip matrix is defined by @xmath43 which has not been presented explicitly as it is rather complicated in structure and can be found readily using a symbolic computation package , such as _",
    "mathematica_.    to arrive at the stability condition we solve the characteristic polynomial of @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath29 is the unit matrix , for the eigenvalues @xmath46 .",
    "we find the four eigenvalues to be a twofold degenerate complex conjugate pair @xmath47 where @xmath48 we now make several observations about eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos ] ) .",
    "first , if there is no winding on the plate , i.e. for @xmath49 eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos ] ) recovers the textbook result for a spherical mirror cavity @xcite .",
    "in fact , given the complexity of the round trip matrix @xmath44 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mrt ] ) , we find it remarkable that the presence of winding results in only a single additional term .",
    "second , we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos ] ) does not change if the handedness is changed from @xmath50 , as might be expected on grounds of symmetry .",
    "third , we observe that for physically realizable parameters , @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos ] ) can be real , which is a precondition for the stability of ray trajectories in a resonator .",
    "we now quantify the criterion for stability , which is usually written as @xcite @xmath52 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cos ] ) , the left inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : costab ] ) can be shown to lead to the relation @xmath53 which is always satisfied since the left hand side of the inequality is the sum of squares of two real numbers . the right inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : costab ] ) can similarly be simplified to @xmath54 it is revealing to verify the physical consistency of this simple stability condition in various parametric limits .",
    "the standard spherical cavity result is recovered in the absence of winding @xmath55 . for a fixed length @xmath37 , the presence of winding @xmath56 , destabilizes the cavity if the step size is large @xmath57 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath37 and nonzero winding , the cavity becomes unstable both for a small radius of curvature @xmath58 as well as in the limit of a  plane \" phase plate @xmath59 the resonator is also destabilized if the ray radius is small @xmath60 while the spherical mirror resonator stability condition @xmath61 is recovered for a large ray radius @xmath62 for the parameters @xmath63 cm , @xmath64 m , and @xmath65 mm , we find the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rstab ] ) to be 1.4 , which should be a measurable shift in the stability boundary from @xmath66 .",
