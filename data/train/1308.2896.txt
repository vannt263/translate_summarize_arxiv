    "<S> for the five different values of @xmath4 , the respective multiplicities of @xmath4 in the maximizing distribution @xmath77 are @xmath78 . ]    _ conclusions and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superbound ] ) , we provide an easily evaluable bound for the normalization factor and normalization ratio of biboson composites , which can be readily applied to any composite system to clarify whether the composite boson under consideration can be treated as ideal . by deliberately leaving the realm of ideal bosons , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a transition between two well - defined regimes : when @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 , and a condensate of biboson composites can be treated as a bec of ordinary bosons with negligible substructure . for @xmath81 , however , schmidt modes with magnitude @xmath4 are macroscopically populated , the resulting _ super - condensate _ is governed by the super - bunching tendency of bibosons . in the super - condensate , not only do all composites condense in the same state @xmath66 , but on a _ subordinate _ level , also their constituents condense ! to observe this bec - bec@xmath82 transition , the macroscopic population of the schmidt modes with the highest expansion coefficients may be addressed by a suitable species - selective probe .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect super - bunching of bibosons ( see fig .  [ figcounting.pdf ] ) to facilitate the bec of composites , which may occur at lower densities and higher temperatures than for a gas of elementary bosons . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this provides an original means to probe the two - particle wave - function of the constituents non - destructively , via the statistical behavior of the composite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> composites made of two identical bosons , or of three or even more bosonic constituents will behave in an even more violently super - bosonic way : the resulting commutator of multi - boson operators ( [ commutationdibosons ] ) and the over - normalization ( [ overnormalization ] ) will be enhanced further . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a general schmidt decomposition for three - particle states @xcite , however , renders an investigation beyond the two - constituent paradigm difficult . </S>",
    "<S> an approach via entanglement measures for multipartite entanglement seems advisable @xcite , and could further tighten the connection between composite - particle physics and quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> another desideratum is the interference @xcite and the statistical behavior @xcite of biboson composites , which can be approached via the bounds presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation - dependent commutator ( [ commutationdibosons ] ) , however , makes a formal treatment difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> physical composition is a hierarchical property , and we expect a subtle interplay between the pauli principle that acts on all elementary fermions and the super - bunching induced by constituent bosons : for example , two fermions may be combined to form a composite boson , two such bosons may then be joined to another superordinate compound . depending on the resulting four - fermion - state , the emerging composite needs to be treated as a `` perfect '' boson , as a super - bosonic two - boson compound , or as a sub - bosonic four - fermion aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization ratio then indicates which description is more appropriate , and may contribute , e.g. , to the debate on @xmath1-particle condensation @xcite .    </S>",
