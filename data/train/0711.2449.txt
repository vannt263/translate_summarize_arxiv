    "the x - ray source rx j1914.4 + 2456 ( hereafter rx j1914 + 24 ) has been the subject of much debate since its discovery during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey .",
    "a number of competing models have been put forward to account for its observed properties , but all of them involve a stellar binary system . the models can be split into accretion and non - accretion models . the non - accretion model is the unipolar inductor ( ui ) model where dissipation of large electrical currents heat the magnetic white dwarf ( wu et al 2002 ) .",
    "it shares many similar observational characteristics to the x - ray source rx j0806.3 + 1527 ( hereafter rx j0806 + 15 , see cropper et al 2004a for a review ) .",
    "one of the main uncertainties to understanding the nature of rx j1914 + 24 is accurately determining its x - ray luminosity , @xmath0 . in the ui model , @xmath0 is proportional to the rate of change of the orbital period and the degree of asynchronisation between the binary orbital period and the primary star ( wu et al 2002 , dallosso et al 2007 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we know go onto to discuss the physical plausibility of the three spectral models which we have used .",
    "namely , the absorbed blackbody with an absorption component and an emission component , and the blackbody with absorption component with non - solar abundances .      isolated neutron stars ( ins ) with high magnetic fields have been found to show absorption lines which have been attributed to either a proton cyclotron line or an electron cyclotron line , see zane et al ( 2005 ) , haberl ( 2007 ) and schwope et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "the similarity between the spectral parameters of rx j1914 + 24 and some ins is quite striking .",
    "for instance , the width of the line and its equivalent width as measured in rx j1914 + 24 is very similar to that of rbs 1223 ( schwope et al 2007 ) .",
    "also the variation in the observed flux in the energy range 0.351.5kev of the ins rx j0720.43125 is 20% ( cf 17 % between the _ xmm - newton _ observations of rx j1914 + 24 ) showing that non - accreting sources can show a significant variation in their x - ray flux ( the data on rx j0720.43125 were extracted from the _ xmm - newton _ archive ) .",
    "there are , however , some very significant differences between the observed properties of rx j1914 + 24 and that of ins .",
    "the first is that their spin - periods are in the range @xmath1 sec - these are very much shorter than the period seen in rx j1914 + 24 ( 569 sec ) . the second is the luminosity difference - ins show x - ray luminosities @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 . using the inferred unabsorbed fluxes as derived using the blackbody plus gaussian absorption line , we find that rx j1914 + 24 would have to be at a distance of 20 pc to give a comparable luminosity .",
    "if rx j1914 + 24 was so close , we would expect to detect a significant proper motion which has not been observed ( israel et al 2002 ) .",
    "the third difference is the change in the period .",
    "the 569 sec period in rx j1914 + 24 has been found to be decreasing , while the period of the two ins which have been found to show a change in their period are increasing ( cropper et al 2004b , kaplan & van kerkwijk 2005a , kaplan & van kerkwijk 2005b ) .",
    "a fourth difference is the optical brightness , with ins being typically @xmath426 ( see the compilation in haberl 2007 ) , while rx j1914 + 24 is @xmath421 .",
    "we conclude rx j1914 + 24 is not an isolated neutron star . at this point ,",
    "whilst we can not rule out the presence of absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 , we do not consider it the most likely model to explain its x - ray spectrum .",
    "a blackbody with an additional broad emission line does , on first sight , seem rather contrived .",
    "however , such a feature has been claimed to be present in the relatively low resolution _ asca _",
    "spectra of a number of x - ray ultra - compact binaries with neutron star primaries ( eg juett , psaltis & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "the line center of the emission line is remarkably similar in rx j1914 + 24 and the four sources shown described in juett et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "one notable difference is that the temperature of the blackbody component in the x - ray ucbs is much hotter  several hundred ev as opposed to @xmath560 ev  and the fact that they are hard x - ray sources being detected at energies up to many 10 s of kev .",
    "this is the result of the primary being a neutron star as opposed to a white dwarf .",
    "it was claimed that this broad emission feature was due to the superposition of a number of unresolved emission lines .",
    "however , when one of the sources observed using _ asca _ was observed using the _ chandra _ low energy grating spectrometer , it failed to detect any emission features which could give rise to a broad emission feature in low resolution spectra .",
    "we now address one possible reason for this .",
    "juett et al ( 2001 ) found that good fits to _ chandra _ spectra of neutron star ucbs were obtained if the absorption model had non - solar abundances .",
    "in particular , they found a high relative abundance of neon and suggested that this over - abundance was located in the inter - binary system .",
    "however , further work ( eg juett & chakrabarty 2005 ) showed that for individual sources , the ne / o ratio showed evidence for variability from epoch to epoch , which they attributed to source variability .",
    "this implied that the abundances could not be used to determine the composition of the mass donating star .",
    "there is a clear similarity between the neutron star ucbs described by juett et al and rx j1914 + 24 . in each observation of rx j1914 + 24",
    ", there is clear evidence that the absorption component has an overabundance of neon .",
    "for the reasons outlined in",
    " [ ins ] , we rule out rx j1914 + 24 being an isolated neutron star . since all the known neutron star ucbs have x - ray emission extending up to many 10 s of kev we also rule out an accreting neutron star ucb model .",
    "we can not rule out that a neutron star is in a binary system where a secondary star was not filling its roche lobe . in this scenario ,",
    "an x - ray bright system would have to be powered by ui .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the line of sight absorption to rx j1914 + 24 has a chance enhancement of neon .",
    "it is much more likely that this overabundance is concentrated in the binary system .",
    "juett & chakrabarty ( 2005 ) noted that for some neutron star ucbs the ne / o abundance varied from epoch to epoch and hence the observations could not be used to determine the abundance of the secondary , mass - donating star , in the binary system . in the case of rx j1914 + 24",
    "there is clear evidence for a significant over - abundance of neon in the absorption component at each epoch . at this stage",
    "it is not clear if this over - abundance is due to circumbinary material left over from a previous stage in the binary formation process or can give us a direct insight into the chemical composition of the secondary star ( if accretion is occurring ) .",
    "what are the implications of our findings regarding the x - ray luminosity of rx j1914 + 24 ?",
    "steeghs et al ( 2006 ) discuss the extinction and distance estimates to rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "while the distance is rather uncertain , it is likely that it is greater than @xmath51 kpc .",
    "we can rule out the lower estimates ( @xmath6 ergs s@xmath3for a distance of 1 kpc ) which were derived using a low temperature thermal plasma model . taking the unabsorbed bolometric fluxes derived using the blackbody with absorption component with variable abundances and assuming a distance of 1 kpc we find @xmath7 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "dallosso et al ( 2007 ) made a detailed investigation of the ui model in the context of rx j1914 + 24 and rx j0806 + 15 .",
    "they predicted that for low luminosities , @xmath6 ergs s@xmath3 , the asynchronism between the orbit and the magnetic star in rx j1914 + 24 would have to be @xmath80.98 , where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the rotation frequency of the primary star and @xmath11 is the orbital frequency . unless rx j1914 + 24 was located at a distance significantly less than 1kpc , we can rule these low values of asynchronism",
    ". for high luminosities ( @xmath12 ergs s@xmath3 ) , dallosso et al ( 2007 ) predicted that an asynchronism of a few was required ( @xmath13 4 ) .",
    "for an observed period of 569 sec , @xmath14 gives a predicted period of @xmath560 - 300 sec .",
    "there is no evidence for power at these periods in the power spectra of the x - ray light curves ( ramsay et al 2006 ) .",
    "until now the nature of the emission source that powers the x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 has been far from clear . in this paper we have shown that it can be well modelled using a simple blackbody model with an absorption component which has non - solar abundances , in particular , an enhancement of neon .    since the x - ray light curves of rx j1914 + 24 and rx j0806 + 15 are practically identical , it suggests that their x - ray emission source is the same . the fact that their x - ray spectra were apparently different ( albeit both being soft ) was therefore perplexing .",
    "our result showing that the emission source is the same for both rx j1914 + 24 and rx j0806 + 15 is therefore very attractive .",
    "indeed their temperatures are virtually identical  we obtain a mean value of @xmath15 ev for rx j1914 + 24 compared to @xmath16 ev for rx j0806 + 15 ( israel et al 2003 ) .",
    "the difference between the x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 and rx j0806 + 15 is that the absorption component of rx j1914 + 24 has enhanced neon abundance .",
    "a further investigation of the optical spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 to search for neon features is strongly encouraged .",
