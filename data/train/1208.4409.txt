    "wealth exchange models , initially proposed to investigate the emergence of wealth inequality  @xcite in human societies , have recently became a subject of intense research  @xcite , following the availability of massive amounts of statistical data describing commercial exchange , as well as wealth and income distributions in different contexts  @xcite . +",
    "conservative stochastic exchange models were first used by angle  @xcite , who considered the spontaneous buildup of wealth differences among equally able agents . in angle s initial model , wealth concentration is a consequence of an explicit statistical advantage favoring richer agents . in other words ,",
    "the `` rich get richer '' phenomenon is assumed explicitely in the exchange rules .",
    "later work showed  @xcite that an explicit advantage favoring the rich is not necessary for wealth concentration to appear .",
    "wealth concentration can develop even if the poor have an explicit statistical advantage .",
    "this rather counterintuitive result , which has only recently been stressed  @xcite in the econophysics literature , arises when the amount at stake in each transaction is proportional to the poorest agent s wealth , e.g  in the so - called yard - sale ( ys ) models  @xcite .",
    "yard sale is an example of multiplicative stochastic exchange , so named because the wealth of the poorest intervening agent is multiplied by a random number after the exchange  @xcite . under ys dynamics , in the long run all wealth may end up in the hands of one lucky agent , even if each pairwise transaction is statistically biased in favor of the poorest of the two intervening agents . therefore , favoring the poor may not suffice to avoid wealth concentration , if the bias in their favor is not strong enough .",
    "interestingly , ys rules constitute a realistic ( although highly simplified ) microscopic model for the wealth exchange process occurring during commercial interaction , or trade  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the conditions for the spontaneous creation of enormous wealth differences for no reason other than luck  @xcite , are built into the commercial exchange rules , even if these rules may superficially appear to favor the poor . because of the possibility of counterintuitive properties such as this one , and because of their relevance for real world commercial exchange , it is clearly of interest to understand the phenomenology of multiplicative exchange models thoroughly .    in simple versions of ys ,",
    "pairs of agents bet for a fraction of the wealth of the poorest of them , who has a probability @xmath0 to win the bet . depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , long - term evolution can give rise either to a nontrivial equilibrium wealth distribution @xmath2 or to _ condensation _ of the whole wealth in the hands of just one agent .",
    "we call the resulting phases , respectively the wealth - sharing ( or stable ) and the wealth - appropriation ( or unstable ) phase . to date ,",
    "most results for this model concern the full - mixture ( or mean - field ) case . however , commercial exchange is often determined by geographical , social or other constraints , which are ignored in the fully mixed approximation . usually , a given agent can only exchange wealth with a reduced subset of other agents who are `` close '' to him by some measure of distance .",
    "these constraints can be described , at the simplest level , by means of a network in which nodes @xmath3 are economic agents and edges @xmath4 represent their possible interactions .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the topological properties of this network of allowed interactions to have a strong impact upon the general properties of wealth exchange processes occurring on them .",
    "recent work  @xcite explores the network of commercial interactions among nations , or `` world trade web ''  @xcite .",
    "these studies make it clear that the topology of interaction networks is strongly correlated with the dynamical and static properties of the resulting wealth exchange process taking place on those networks  @xcite .",
    "numerical investigations  @xcite of the bouchaud - mezard  @xcite model ( bmm ) on networks , find wealth distributions @xmath2 that change from lognormal to power - law when the connectivity is increased , for reasons that are easily understood .",
    "however , the bmm , while being an interesting solvable model , considers linear exchange ( the amount exchanged is proportional to wealth differences ) , which is not very realistic  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bmm includes both exchange and nonconservative processes ( such as investment ) , and it is precisely from the interplay between the two that the network s connectivity becomes important in the above studies .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze network effects for a realistic model of pure conservative commercial exchange .",
    "although real economic systems involve nonconservative wealth - modifying processes as well , it is important to first understand the properties of the individual wealth - affecting mechanisms in isolation . in this work ,",
    "we study the yard - sale ( ys ) model on networks .",
    "our network - restricted version of ys is defined as follows : at each timestep , every agent @xmath5 interacts ( exchanges wealth according to ys rules ) with another agent @xmath6 that is randomly chosen among its neighbors , i.e. among those agents @xmath6 for which a link @xmath4 exists . the interaction network is fixed in time . therefore , a pair of agents not connected by a link will never interact directly .",
    "if the coordination number @xmath7 is roughly the same for all nodes , each agent engages in two interactions per timestep , on average .",
    "we consider here one - dimensional chains and two - dimensional square lattices with nearest - neighbor links and periodic boundary conditions , as well as erds - rnyi random graphs  @xcite with variable coordination @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath8 ,",
    "the random graph becomes a complete graph , and every pair @xmath4 has the same probability to interact .",
    "this is the full - mixture case . + we focus on the identification of network - specific effects , i.e.  the extent to which the static and dynamic properties of the ys model , when implemented on a network , depart from those in full - mixture .",
    "our results show that , while the stable wealth distribution @xmath2 is mildly network - dependent , the location of the interface @xmath9 that delimits the stable phase remains the same as in the full - mixture case , for all networks considered in this work .",
    "the critical line @xmath9 is therefore universal , in the sense defined in the context of the theory of phase transitions .",
    "dynamical properties , as for example decorrelation times , on the other hand , do depend on the network . decorrelation times , which in this case are a measure of `` social mobility '' of agents , are found to diverge at the interface with the unstable phase .",
    "this divergence is used to locate the critical line with high precision .    in the unstable , or wealth - appropriation , phase , dynamical as well as long - time properties of ys",
    "are found to be strongly network - dependent .",
    "the most important difference with full - mixture is in this case that , on a network , complete condensation in the hands of one agent no longer occurs . on a network , instead , in the long run an extensive set of `` locally rich '' agents ( lra ) appears , each connected only to extremely impoverished agents .",
    "this leads to the effective cessation of all exchange activity , a phenomenon similar to dynamical freezing .",
    "this freezing onto a disordered final state is observed in the whole unstable phase .",
    "the properties of the final set of lras , and their final wealth distribution , depend on the network topology , as well as upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the connections between the appearance of a set of locally rich agents and the process of coalescence ( or coagulation ) of immobile reactants  @xcite on networks .",
    "these connections provide analytical predictions for the number of lras on random graphs , which are consistent with our own numerical results . by increasing the average connectivity @xmath7 of a network ,",
    "the number of lras onto which wealth condenses is decreased , until , in the limit @xmath10 , which is the full - mixture case , only one lra remains , i.e  full condensation is recovered .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : yard - sale - full ] recalls some results for ys in full - mixture . in section  [ sec : numer - results - stable ] ,",
    "numerical results on networks in the stable phase are presented and compared with full mixture results . in particular ,",
    "decorrelation times are used in this section to locate the interface with high precision .",
    "wealth appropriation dynamics on networks is studied in section  [ sec : numer - results - unst ] , where it is found that wealth condenses onto an extensive number of locally rich agents ( lra ) .",
    "their number and wealth distribution are analyzed in this section .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discussion - results ] offers a discussion of our results .",
    "consider wealth exchange for a pair of agents @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath11 before interaction , according to the following ys rules .",
    "the agents bet for an amount .",
    "the poorest agent ( @xmath5 ) wins the bet with probability @xmath0 , in which case @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or looses the bet with probability @xmath14 , in which case @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the wealth of the poor agent is therefore multiplied by a random factor @xmath17 , which equals @xmath18 with probability @xmath0 and @xmath19 with probability @xmath14 .",
    "long - term evolution under these rules gives rise either to a stable wealth distribution @xmath2 or to condensation , depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the location of the critical line @xmath9 below which condensation occurs can be derived as follows  @xcite .",
    "the wealth of a very poor agent undergoes a random multiplicative process  @xcite with multiplier @xmath17 at each timestep . after a large number @xmath20 of timesteps ,",
    "the appropriate central tendency estimator for @xmath21 is its geometric average * @xmath22 * , where @xmath23 if , there will be a systematic transference of wealth from poorer to richer agents .",
    "this is the wealth - appropriation , or unstable , phase . in this phase ,",
    "wealth differences among agents are amplified in time , until the whole wealth ends up in the hands of a single ( in full - mixture ) agent in the long run  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath24 , the system is in the wealth - sharing , or stable , phase .",
    "wealth is transferred from richer to poorer agents , which tends to `` iron out '' wealth fluctuations . in the long run ,",
    "the distribution of wealth reaches a nontrivial equilibrium form @xmath2 , which depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    by the heuristic argument above , the critical interface separating stable and unstable phases is given by , or @xmath25 a more rigorous analysis  @xcite , involving the master equation for @xmath2 in the full - mixture approximation , confirms ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "+ notice that the average return of the poorest agent  @xcite is positive whenever @xmath26 .",
    "there is thus a region @xmath27 where complete wealth concentration occurs , i.e.  poor agents impoverish further , despite the average return of poor agents being positive .        a dynamical characterization that is useful in the stable phase is the relaxation timescale for equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the excess wealth , where @xmath28 is the average per agent wealth , gives the amount by which the wealth @xmath29 of an agent @xmath5 departs from average at time @xmath20 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath30 at time @xmath31 , averaged over @xmath32 timesteps , is then defined as @xmath33 we use here the normalized correlation function , which equals one for @xmath34 and decays as @xmath35 for large @xmath31 .",
    "a small value of @xmath36 means that being richer or poorer than average at a given time @xmath20 has little predictive power @xmath31 timesteps later .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 measures the `` mobility '' , in the wealth scale , of a typical agent over a time horizon of @xmath31 timesteps .",
    "the timescale @xmath37 over which @xmath36 converges to zero measures the amount of time needed for full `` social mixture '' ( decorrelation from initial wealths , or loss of memory ) . in a statistical mechanics context , @xmath37 is the relaxation time needed for the decay of equilibrium wealth - fluctuations , or `` decorrelation time '' .",
    "borrowing from the theory of equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite , one expects @xmath38 to diverge as the critical interface is approached from above , as @xmath39 where the dynamical exponent @xmath40 can be a function of @xmath1 eventually .",
    "as shown later , the numerical estimation of @xmath38 allows a very precise determination of the location @xmath41 of the interface .",
    "when @xmath42 , the system is in the unstable phase , wealth differences are amplified in time and this eventually leads to condensation in the fully mixed case . in the whole unstable phase",
    ", the decorrelation time @xmath37 is infinite .",
    "therefore an agents position in the wealth scale becomes frozen , in the long run .",

    "accordingly , the transient wealth distribution is of the form @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : ginill]a compares ( [ eq:10 ] ) with numerical results .      in numerical simulations ,",
    "a practical criterion is necessary to define wealth condensation within predefined limits .",
    "we use for this purpose the ratio @xmath53 , involving the wealths of the richest and second - richest agents in the system .",
    "this ratio is one for evenly distributed wealth , and goes to zero when all wealth condenses onto a single agent .",
    "an alternative useful measure of condensation is the normalized second moment @xmath54 which is similar to the participation ratio in localization studies .",
    "@xmath55 is of order @xmath56 if wealth is more or less evenly distributed among @xmath57 agents , and goes to one upon condensation onto a single agent .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 approximates the number of economically active agents in the system , as much as the inverse participation ratio estimates the number of sites over which a normal mode , or an electron , spreads .      the timescale @xmath59 for convergence towards the condensed state is an interesting property that quantifies the dynamics in the unstable phase .",
    "this timescale can be estimated theoretically , in the full - mixture case . using ( [ eq:10 ] ) one has that , with @xmath60 from ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) , we see that .",
    "therefore , the condensation timescale @xmath61 diverges as @xmath62 on approach to the critical interface .",
    "+ simple analysis of ( [ eq:10 ] ) shows that @xmath48 attains its maximum value at time @xmath63 , and goes exponentially fast to zero afterwards for all @xmath64 .",
    "this is understood in the following terms . during the condensation process in the unstable phase , an agent with rank @xmath49 systematically extracts wealth from poorer agents ( those with @xmath65 ) and transfers some of it to richer agents ( those with @xmath66 ) .",
    "as long as the wealth of poorer agents so allows , his balance will be positive , so his wealth will at first increase .",
    "but this increase happens at the expense of poorer agents , and for times @xmath67 these will have exhausted their wealth . continued transference of wealth upwards ( to richer agents )",
    "will in turn make the agent with rank @xmath49 impoverish as well .",
    "therefore , each rank goes bankrupted at a specific timescale .",
    "poorer ranks ( of order @xmath68 ) do so at times of order @xmath69 , while richer ones ( of order one ) take time @xmath70 .",
    "the second - richest agent goes bankrupted at time @xmath71 , leaving a single rich agent to account for most of the wealth .",

    "yard - sale ( ys )  @xcite is a simple but realistic model for commercial exchange that presents two phases : a stable ( or wealth - sharing ) phase where wealth is distributed and an unstable ( or wealth - appropriation ) one where wealth concentrates in the hands of a few agents .",

    "our numerical results strongly suggest that the critical interface @xmath9 derived in the full - mixture approximation ( eq .",

    "these lras form an independent set  @xcite in the network , and therefore define a coloring of it .",
    "the final density of agents with nonzero wealth is thus finite on networks , while it is zero for full mixture . in recent related work  @xcite",

    "it is only in the limit of a complete graph , which is the fully mixed case , or , ( on any network ) in the limit @xmath148 ( i.e.  right at the interface ) , that condensation onto a single agent is observed .",
    "+ we have discussed previously unnoticed connections between wealth condensation in ys and earlier studies of annihilation  @xcite or coalescence  @xcite of immobile reactants , a related statistical problem where the distinction between network results and mean - field ones ( i.e.  zero vs nonzero final density of lras ) was first noticed  @xcite . with the help of these connections ,",

    "a good coincidence is found throughout the entire unstable phase .",
    "furthermore , by using analytical expressions for the density of remaining lras on random graphs , we were able to explain our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w2.freezing ] ) showing that on random graphs , deep inside the unstable phase . + surprisingly , the density of lras is essentially constant in the whole unstable phase , although their wealth distribution is not .",
    "their wealth distribution is roughly homogeneous , i.e.  has a relatively narrow distribution , except when extremely close to the interface . a particularity that deserves further attention is the fact that the wealth distribution of lras in the frozen state is nearly normal in one and two dimensions , but exponential on random graphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : richsdistr1d ] ) + very close to the interface that delimits the unstable phase from above , however , wealth is no longer homogeneously distributed among the lras , but develops a long right tail of the form @xmath52 until , at the interface itself , only one rich agent remains , which owns the whole systems wealth .",
    "therefore , on the interface itself , condensation onto a single agent is again observed , on any network .",
    "however , the time needed for condensation diverges in this limit , in contraposition to the full mixture case , where wealth condenses onto a single agent in finite time .",
    "+ we have found that ys models only show strongly network - dependent properties when the system s parameters @xmath81 are in the unstable phase . in the light of this result",
    ", the correlations between topological properties and wealth distributions that have been recently observed in experimental studies of global commercial networks  @xcite , may be interpreted as suggesting that the international trade system is itself in the unstable phase .",
    "in other words , that the microscopic exchange rules for international trade are such that favor systematic wealth appropriation by larger agents .",
    "other evidences of this possibility have been recently found by analyzing the distribution of per - capita gross domestic products  @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , as already said in the introduction , global wealth distributions depend on processes other than conservative exchange .",
    "the generation of wealth by endogenous processes , for example , acts as a source of wealth that would avoid freezing in the unstable phase .",
    "a system under unstable exchange , in the presence of wealth creation by endogenous processes , would reach a quasi - stationary state in which wealth is produced everywhere and then channeled towards richer agents by the exchange processes .",
