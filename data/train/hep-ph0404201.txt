    "quark matter is known or expected to have several phases , hadronic phase , quark gluon plasma phase and color superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "when the density of the quarks is small , the hadronic phase arises in low temperature owing to very strong gluonic interactions .",
    "thus , the quarks in the phase are confined@xcite in the hadrons . on the other hand",
    "when the density of the quarks is sufficiently large , the color superconducting phase is expected to arise .",
    "in such a case , gluonic interactions are small , so that attractive forces operate perturbatively between anti - triplet pair of the quarks .",
    "thus , the condensation of the pairs arises to make the superconducting phase realized .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently high , quark matter in both phases melts and forms the quark gluon plasma . among the phases only the hadronic phase is observed .",
    "although the color superconducting phase is very intriguing , present experiments could not produce the phase because large chemical potentials of the quark number such as @xmath1 gev is needed for the production of the phase .",
    "we have recently discussed@xcite a possibility of the stable color ferromagnetic states in dense quark matter .",
    "the ferromagnetic state is caused by the condensation of the color magnetic field , not by the alignment of the quark s magnetic moments .",
    "the states are realized between the hadronic state and the color superconducting state when the chemical potential is varied .",
    "thus , the phase could be observed in the present experiments .",
    "the ferromagnetic states possess a spontaneously generated color magnetic field in maximal abelian sub - algebra and also involve a quantum hall state of off - diagonal gluons .",
    "the gluons have been known to have unstable modes@xcite in the color magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "they occupy the lowest landau level with their spins pointed to the magnetic field and with their energies being imaginary .",
    "the existence of these unstable modes implies that the naive ferromagnetic state ( savvidy vacuum @xcite ) is unstable .",
    "we have recently shown@xcite that the formation of the gluon s quantum hall state ( qhs ) caused by the condensation of the unstable modes stabilizes the ferromagnetic state .",
    "in this paper we review qhs@xcite of electrons in semiconductor and chern - simons gauge theory@xcite for describing the qhs in the next section .",
    "this is because the phenomena and its theory are not popular with hadron physicists . in the section [ qhs ] ,",
    "applying the theory to the unstable gluons , we discuss the properties of qhs of the gluons ; incompressibility , laughlin quasiparticle , etc .",
    "especially , we numerically show that the energy of the laughlin quasiparticle becomes smaller as the gauge coupling constant becomes larger .",
    "since it may vanish at the infinite coupling constant , a bound state of the quasiparticle and anti - quasiparticle would be a state with zero energy even at finite coupling constant .",
    "this implies that the qhs of the gluons becomes unstable against the creation of the bound states at the coupling constant .",
    "these excitations destroy laughlin state of the gluons . as a result",
    ", the qhs decays and the ferromagnetic state also decays . instead",
    ", quark confining state would appear at such large coupling constant .",
    "in other word , at small chemical potential the hadronic phase arises instead of the ferromagnetic phase . in the section [ cf ]",
    "we show that the color superconducting state is more favored than the ferromagnetic state when the number density of the quarks is sufficiently large . in the section [ obs ] we consider phenomenological implications of the color ferromagnetic states of the quark matter . finally in the section [ dis ] we discuss that the existence of the ferromagnetic phase is a very natural consequence in the gluon and quark dynamics .",
    "qhs of electrons was discovered@xcite in 1980 by von klitzing .",
    "he has observed a plateau of hall conductivities @xmath3 as a function of magnetic field imposed on the two - dimensional quantum well fabricated in a semiconductor .",
    "it implies that @xmath3 is quantized with the unit of the fundamental constant @xmath4 at the plateau .",
    "it is called quantum hall effect .",
    "the observation indicated the existence of a specific state of two - dimensional electrons in the well under the strong magnetic field , @xmath2 , typically @xmath5 gauss . in these experiments ,",
    "electrons are trapped in two - dimensional quantum well with its width @xmath6 nm , so that their motions are restricted in two - dimensional space . in order to move in a direction perpendicular to the space ,",
    "electrons need to gain energies @xmath7 ev .",
    "thus , in experiments with low temperature @xmath8k , electrons move only in the two - dimensional space .",
    "the two - dimensional electrons in the magnetic field make cyclotron motions with their radius @xmath9 and their states are specified by landau levels .",
    "each of them has a large number of degenerate states ; the degeneracy per unit area is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the original qhs was called integer quantum hall state since the state is observed at filling factor being integer ; the filling factor is defined as @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is two - dimensional number density of electrons , typically @xmath13 . )",
    "thus , the filling factor means a fraction of electron occupation in a landau level .",
    "for example , the filling factor @xmath14 implies that electrons occupy a third of the lowest landau level .",
    "the integer filling factor implies that some of landau levels are completely occupied .",
    "integer quantum hall effect can be understood as a localization property of each two - dimensional electrons ; some of them are localized due to impurities and the others are not localized in the magnetic field in spite of the impurities . in general , all of two - dimensional electrons must be localized around impurities .",
    "this is well known as anderson localization .",
    "then , the system is an insulator because there are no carriers of electric currents ; localized electrons do not carry the currents .",
    "but the localization theorem does not hold when the magnetic field is present .",
    "we note that the effect of the impurities lifts the degeneracy of the states in a landau level .",
    "thus , the density of states has a finite width . under the circumstance , almost of all the states",
    "are still localized .",
    "but , electrons occupying the states around the center of the landau level are extended all over the system so that they can carry electric currents .",
    "this property of the localization in two dimensional electrons yields plateaus in the hall conductivity around @xmath15 integers . in this way ,",
    "integer quantum hall effects are caused by the interplay of the impurities and each electron , and many - body correlations among electrons are not important .",
    "fractional quantum hall effects were discovered@xcite in 1982 by tsui at the filling factor being fractional numbers , e.g.  @xmath16 .",
    "( he observed quantum hall plateaus at such fractional filling factors . )",
    "electrons occupy a fraction in the lowest landau level .",
    "the fractional qhss are understood to be caused by many - body effects of electrons , just like superconductivity .",
    "impurities do not play important roles in these qhss .",
    "laughlin@xcite proposed a wavefunction for this qhs , at the filling factor being @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting complex coordinate of electrons with charge @xmath20 , where we have used a symmetric gauge potential @xmath21 for the magnetic field . here",
    ", @xmath22 is an odd integer for the fermi statistics of electrons .",
    "numerical simulations show that the ground states of the electrons at the fractional filling factors are well described by the laughlin wavefunctions even if the repulsive coulomb interaction is replaced by a delta function ; the precise form of the interaction between electrons is not important for the realization of qhs .",
    "in general , a system of electrons partially occupying the lowest landau level is compressible , namely , the system has no gap ; excitation levels are distributed continuously above the ground state .",
    "however , the qhs has a gap just like the bcs state .",
    "that is , the qhs is characterized as a state with gap .",
    "we note that free electron gas has no gap , so that even with the coulomb interaction taken into account the gas does not gain the gap in general .",
    "but the bcs states are gapped states formed from fermi gas with small attractive force among electrons around fermi surface .",
    "similarly , the qhss are gapped states formed from the gas of two - dimensional electrons interacting repulsively with each other under the strong magnetic field .",
    "these gapped states arise at the fractional filling factors .",
    "the gap of the qhs is given by the energy of the bound state of the laughlin s quasiparticles .",
    "the quasiparticles were originally discussed by laughlin based on the laughlin wave functions@xcite . they were argued to possess fractional electric charges @xmath23 in the qhs with the filling factor , @xmath24 .",
    "namely , if we add an electron to the qhs , there appear @xmath22 laughlin s quasiparticles each of which possesses a fractional charge of @xmath25 . on the other hand , if we extract an electron from the state , there appear @xmath22 laughlin s anti - quasiparticles , each of which possesses a fractional charge of @xmath26 .",
    "these quasiparticles , not electrons , play the role of carrying electric currents in the fractional qhs .",
    "therefore , the hall conductivity is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the plateaus at the fractional filling factor are understood@xcite as the localization properties of these quasiparticles .",
    "the excitations on the qhs are given by bound states of the quasiparticle and anti - quasiparticle ; they attract each other because of the coulomb interaction . in this way the gap of the qhs is given by the energy of this bound state of the laughlin s quasiparticles .",
    "we have bcs theory for understanding superconducting states .",
    "but we do not have similar theory for the qhs .",
    "namely , there is no effective fermionic theory of electrons explaining the properties of the qhs , e.g. laughlin wavefunctions .",
    "we only know that numerical simulations using hamiltonian of electrons interacting with each other through the coulomb potential , confirm the validity of the wavefunctions and the gap in the state . on the other hand , there is a bosonic theory in the case of the superconductivity , which is well known as landau - ginzburg theory .",
    "similarly , there is a chern - simons gauge theory of bosonized electrons for understanding the qhs . in this section , we wish to explain it .",
    "it is well known that bcs states are described by landau - ginzburg effective lagrangian ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote cooper pair of electrons and electromagnetic fields respectively .",
    "the ground state is a condensed state of the cooper pairs , namely , @xmath31 . since the gauge symmetry , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "is spontaneously broken , vortex excitations with the magnetic flux @xmath34 arise .",
    "these are magnetic vortices penetrating superconductors .",
    "when we switch off the gauge interaction , we have an effective model of superfluids .",
    "similarly , there is a bosonic theory for the qhs of electrons .",
    "it is a theory of composite electrons with chern - simons gauge field@xcite ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes mass of electrons and @xmath37 is the coulomb interaction between electrons with background positive charges @xmath38 .",
    "the term @xmath39 denotes the external magnetic field imposed for the realization of qhs and has no kinetic term .",
    "the factor of @xmath40 should be taken as @xmath41odd integer for the boson field @xmath42 to describe fermionic electrons .",
    "the boson field @xmath42 represents composite electrons ; boson @xmath42 attached with flux of @xmath43 .",
    "that is , fermions in two - dimensional space can be described by bosons attached with a fictitious flux @xmath44 of chern - simons gauge field @xmath43 .",
    "owing to this flux , the exchange of the bosonic particles induces a phase @xmath45 in their wavefunction .",
    "thus , with the choice of @xmath46odd integer , the wavefunctions represent particles with fermi statistics .",
    "one can show that @xmath47 serves to describe the composite electrons .    using hamiltonian derived from the lagrangian",
    ", we can obtain schrdinger equation for electrons with fermi statistics . in that sense ,",
    "the lagrangian correctly describes two - dimensional system of electrons in the magnetic field .",
    "we should note that if chern - simons gauge fields are absent in the above lagrangian and @xmath42 obeys fermi statistics , the lagrangian describes ordinary electron system .",
    "we should comment that the field @xmath42 describes an electron with a particular spin component parallel to the magnetic field . in order to describe the electron with the other spin component , we need an additional boson field as well as chern - simon gauge fields .",
    "> from equations of motions derived from @xmath47 , we can see that qhss are ground - state solutions such as @xmath48 similar to the case of bcs states .",
    "these solutions can be obtained only when the relation , @xmath49 , holds .",
    "namely , the magnetic field @xmath50 is canceled by the chern - simons gauge field @xmath43 . the chern - simons flux @xmath51 can be represented by the density @xmath12 of electrons @xmath52 such as @xmath53 , an equation derived by taking variational derivative of @xmath47 in @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the solutions can be found only when the filling factor @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 . in this way",
    "we can understand that qhss are condensed states of bosonized electrons @xmath42 and are realized only at @xmath57 , etc .  for @xmath58 , etc .",
    "in order to see@xcite that the states are really qhss with appropriate hall conductivities , @xmath3 , we derive @xmath3 in the following .",
    "we introduce a gauge potential @xmath30 of electric field @xmath59 in @xmath47 ; @xmath60 . shifting the integration variable of @xmath61 in the functional integral @xmath62 such as @xmath63",
    ", we calculate electric current @xmath64 , which is given by @xmath65 in the state of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the hall conductivity is correctly given by @xmath68 . in this way",
    "we find that the condensed state of the bosonized electrons is the qhs .",
    "( one ( a.i . ) of the authors previously showed@xcite that laughlin wavefunctions can be derived from the condensed states of the field @xmath42 . )",
    "laughlin s quasiparticles are excited states of the qhs . in the picture of the bosonized electrons ,",
    "they are presented by vortex excitations on the state of @xmath69 , where u(1 ) gauge symmetry ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) is spontaneously broken and hence there are topological excitations associated with the symmetry .",
    "actually , we can find a vortex soliton such that @xmath72 with boundary conditions , @xmath73 and @xmath74 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is an azimuthal angle and @xmath22 is an integer .",
    "this vortex is similar to the magnetic vortex in the superconductor , but the former has a quantized electron number while the latter has the quantized magnetic flux .",
    "this is because the flux quantization @xmath78 implies the electron number quantization @xmath79 of the vortex solutions .",
    "thus , laughlin s quasiparticles have a fractional electric charge such as @xmath80 .",
    "this fractionality of the electric charges has been observed@xcite . in this way",
    "the theory of the composite electrons can describe the qhss as condensed states of bosons in the mean field approximation just like landau - ginzburg theory of superconducting states .",
    "( this similarity can naturally lead to a prediction of the presence of josephson effects in bilayer quantum hall systems@xcite . )",
    "up to now , we have given a brief review of the theory of qhss in the two - dimensional electron system .",
    "we , now , apply the idea to analyze a qhs of gluons , which appears in dense quark matter .",
    "we discuss su(2 ) gauge theory for simplicity .",
    "it has been known@xcite that in the gauge theory one - loop effective potential for color magnetic field has non - trivial minimum ; @xmath81 , with an appropriate renormalization of the gauge coupling @xmath82 . here",
    ", we have not included contributions from quarks . even if their contributions are included ,",
    "only change in @xmath83 is a numerical factor in the coefficient of the first term .",
    "( beyond the one - loop approximation , the presence of the nontrivial minimum in @xmath84 has been proved@xcite in general under the assumption that the running coupling constant @xmath85 becomes infinity at a finite @xmath84 . )",
    "this apparently seems to imply spontaneous generation of the color magnetic field , namely , the realization of a ferromagnetic state .",
    "but it is not so simple since the imaginary part in @xmath83 is present when @xmath86 .",
    "it means that the state with the magnetic field is unstable as well as the perturbative vacuum state with @xmath87 .",
    "actually , the unstable modes of gluons are present@xcite in the state with the magnetic field and are expected to make some stable condensed states .",
    "what kind of the stable state is formed of the unstable gluons ?",
    "we have shown@xcite that the state is a qhs of the gluons with the color magnetic field . in order to explain it , we rewrite the gluon s lagrangian with the use of the variables ,  electromagnetic field \"",
    "@xmath88 where indices @xmath89 denote color components ,    @xmath90    with @xmath91 .",
    "we have used a gauge condition , @xmath92 . using the lagrangian we can derive that the energy @xmath93 of the charged vector field @xmath94 in the magnetic field , @xmath95 , is given by @xmath96 with a gauge choice , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where we have taken the spatial direction of @xmath99 being along @xmath100 axis .",
    "@xmath101 expresses the contribution from spin components of @xmath102 .",
    "the integer @xmath103 and @xmath104 represent landau level and momentum in the direction parallel to the magnetic field , respectively",
    ".    obviously , the modes with @xmath105 are unstable modes occupying the lowest landau level and with spin parallel to @xmath99 . among them , the modes with @xmath106 are the most unstable ones , which means that they have the largest negative value of @xmath107 .",
    "thus , they are expected to play the main role of forming a stable state . here",
    "we should remember a simple model of a scalar field with a double - well potential , @xmath108 .",
    "the state @xmath109 is unstable and unstable modes @xmath110 with their energies @xmath111 arise on the state . in the case ,",
    "the most unstable uniform mode , @xmath112 , among @xmath110 , condenses to form a stable state @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the most unstable modes with @xmath106 are relevant to the formation of the true ground state also in the gauge theory .",
    "since they have no @xmath100 dependence , they are two - dimensional objects occupying the lowest landau level .",
    "the situation is quite analogous to the case in the two - dimensional electrons forming qhss just as mentioned above .",
    "the only difference is that in the gauge theory gluons are bosons , while electrons are fermions .    in order to find the stable state in the gauge theory ,",
    "we extract only the most unstable modes from the lagrangian , eq .  ( [ l ] ) , ignoring the other modes coupled with them and obtain a two - dimensional lagrangian ,    @xmath114    with @xmath115 , where the field @xmath116 denotes the unstable modes in the lowest landau level .",
    "( we used the condition that these modes occupy the lowest landau level : @xmath117 . )",
    "@xmath118 is the coherent length of the magnetic field .",
    "here we are thinking the quark matter with its length scale @xmath118 .",
    "then , a condition of @xmath119 must be satisfied for the consistency . without the condition",
    ", the states of quarks and gluons can not be specified by landau levels .",
    "we note that the field @xmath120 has a color charge associated with @xmath121 of su(2 ) algebra .",
    "this color charge is only a conserved quantity when the color magnetic field @xmath122 is generated spontaneously in the su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "this lagrangian is quite similar to the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) of the superconductivity .",
    "it apparently seems that the ground state is simply given by @xmath123 , the condensed state of the field @xmath120 .",
    "but it is impossible because the term of @xmath39 is present in the kinetic term .",
    "if this term vanishes , the term of the negative mass also vanishes so that the solution @xmath124 does not exist .",
    "physically , the lagrangian @xmath125 describes such a system that the particles of @xmath120 move in the magnetic field and interact with each other through a repulsive potential of a delta function .",
    "there is a numerical simulation@xcite that the nonrelativistic particles with such a repulsive potential can form a laughlin state even if they are bosons .",
    "thus , the gluons represented by @xmath120 may form a quantum hall state .      in order to see the qhs of the field , @xmath120 , explicitly",
    ", we introduce chern - simons gauge field to make composite gluons ; bosons attached with the chern - simons flux .",
    "then , a relevant lagrangian is given by    @xmath126    where the statistical factor @xmath40 should be taken as @xmath127integer to maintain the equivalence of the system described by @xmath128 to that of @xmath125 .",
    "this new field @xmath129 represents the composite gluons attached with the chern - simons flux @xmath43 .    the equivalence between @xmath125 and @xmath128 has been shown @xcite in the operator formalism although the equivalence had been known in the path integral formalism using the world lines of the @xmath129 particles .",
    "( in the formalism the last term in eq .  ( [ la ] ) produces a phase , @xmath130 , in wavefunctions when trajectories of two particles are interchanged . )",
    "this lagrangian corresponds to @xmath47 of composite electrons .",
    "obviously , there is the u(1 ) gauge symmetry such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 ; a nonvanishing term , @xmath133 in @xmath128 under the gauge transformation vanishes in the action integral @xmath134 with appropriate boundary conditions .    in deriving equations of motion",
    ", we need to impose a condition of the modes @xmath129 occupying the lowest landau level@xcite .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath147 .",
    "this @xmath146 represents color charge density possessed by the gluons @xmath129 .",
    "the composite gluons condense to form the qhs only when @xmath148 is equal to @xmath56 .",
    "this is quite similar to the case of the ordinary qhs mentioned above .",
    "it is easy to show that this state possesses appropriate hall conductivity @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , we understand that the condensed state @xmath150 is a qhs of gluons .",
    "it apparently seems that there are infinitely many qhss with the filling factor @xmath151 because @xmath40 can take infinitely many values such as @xmath152 with positive even integer @xmath22 . in the qhss of electrons , the states with small filling factors have low densities of electrons . in such a case electrons forming wigner crystal",
    "is energetically more stable than electrons forming the qhss . actually , such qhss with small filling factors , e.g.  @xmath153 , have not been observed .",
    "we expect that similarly in the gauge theory , wigner crystal of gluons would be realized when the filling factor is much small @xmath154 .",
    "the analysis is now in progress .    we should mention that the qhs of gluons is realized in a sector with nonzero color charge , not in the vacuum sector",
    "; the condensed state of @xmath129 possesses a color charge .",
    "such a state can arise in dense quark matter where the color charge of quarks is transmitted to the condensate .",
    "this fact leads to the minimum number density of quarks for realizing a qhs , for example , qhs with @xmath155 where the color charge density of the condensate given by @xmath156 must be supplied by the quarks . since the color charge of the quarks is a half of the gluon s , the necessary number density @xmath157 of the quarks for producing the qhs of the gluons is given by    @xmath158    with number density @xmath159 of positive ( negative ) colored quarks , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the number of flavors and colors respectively .",
    "@xmath162 denotes the fermi momentum given by @xmath163 with the quark mass @xmath164 and the chemical potential @xmath165 of the quark matter at zero temperature .",

    "we note that this value of @xmath165 is necessary , not sufficient for the realization of the state . in this way",
    ", the presence of the dense quark matter is necessary for producing the qhs of gluons . on the other hand , when we are concerned with the vacuum sector , such a qhs can not arise so that the ferromagnetic state is unstable .",
    "probably , the large fluctuation of the unstable modes may form a confining vacuum called a spaghetti vacuum @xcite .    in order to calculate the ground state energy we derive hamiltonian ,    @xmath167    thus",

    "the fact implies that the qhs becomes unstable as the coupling becomes large .",
    "this is because the energy of the ferromagnetic state ( @xmath177 ) involving the qhs becomes larger than the energy of the perturbative ground state with @xmath178 ; we have normalized the energy such that the energy of the perturbative ground state vanishes at @xmath87 .",
    "this is consistent with naive expectation that at sufficiently large @xmath179 , the hadronic state ( @xmath178 ) is realized instead of the ferromagnetic state : the hadronic or confining ground state is more stable than the perturbative ground state for such a large coupling .",
    "therefore , at large coupling constants the ferromagnetic state becomes unstable and the hadronic state would be realized .    on the other hand , @xmath180 as @xmath181 .",
    "this implies that when the coupling constant is sufficiently small , the ferromagnetic state is stable since it has much small energy .",
    "it apparently seems to be unnatural because the perturbative ground state may be realized at the small coupling .",
    "but we should mention that the qhs of the gluons is realized only in dense quark matter , not in the vacuum because for the realization of the qhs , the color charge associated with @xmath121 must be supplied from somewhere in the neutral system : the condensate of @xmath129 possesses the color charge , which must be supplied from the quark matter .",
    "therefore , even at small coupling constants , the qhs can arise as a stable state in the quark matter .",
    "( in the vacuum the perturbative ground state is realized at such small coupling since there are no color charges . )",
    "analyzing small fluctuations @xmath182 , etc .  around the solution of the ground state , we can see that the energy of the fluctuations has a real positive gap given by @xmath183 .",

    "then , we obtain @xmath184 where @xmath185 is an arbitrary function of @xmath186 and @xmath187 is defined by putting @xmath188 .",
    "we assume that the solutions are spherically symmetric , namely , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are functions only of the radial coordinate @xmath191 . then , when we take @xmath192 , it represents a solution of a vortex with vorticity being equal to @xmath22 where @xmath22 is a positive integer . for simplicity , we consider only a solution with @xmath193 .",
    "boundary conditions are such that @xmath194 ( or @xmath195 ) and @xmath196 as @xmath197 , and @xmath198 as @xmath199 for avoiding a singularity at @xmath200 .",
    "this boundary condition at @xmath201 leads to a quantization of color charges carried by the topological soliton .",
    "namely , the soliton has the flux @xmath202 where we have used the boundary condition .",
    "this means that the color charge of the soliton , which is the integral of the color charge density given in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , is given by @xmath56 .",
    "in general it is given by @xmath203 for the soliton with the vorticity of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we find that the color charge of the soliton is quantized .    taking @xmath204 with @xmath205 being function only of @xmath206 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])@xmath207([eq3 ] ) are reduced to @xmath208 the second equation can be obtained directly by inserting a solution @xmath209 of the lowest landau level condition into the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , and by taking a variational derivative in @xmath210 .",
    "we have solved the equations numerically , and obtained their configurations and energies for various coupling parameter @xmath115 and @xmath40 ; fig .",
    "1 and fig .  2 .",
    "we can see that the energy of the vortex soliton approaches zero as @xmath211 goes to infinity .",
    "we note that the typical energy scale of the solution is given by @xmath212 , which goes to zero as @xmath175 .",
    "thus , the energy of the solution goes to zero as @xmath213 .",
    "this indicates a possibility that the qhs becomes unstable at sufficiently large coupling constant of @xmath211 since the energy of the bound state of a vortex ( @xmath193 ) and an anti - vortex ( @xmath214 ) can become negative at large coupling constants .",
    "they have color charges opposite with each other and their binding energy becomes larger than the intrinsic energies of the vortices at large coupling constants .",
    "then , such excitations of the bound states are produced unlimitedly and consequently , the qhs decays : the whole space is occupied by such solitons and the condensate melts because the condensate of the gluons vanishes at the center of the vortex ; @xmath215 .",
    "this bound state corresponds to the roton excitation in the qhs of electrons .",
    "although these arguments are speculative , the instability of the qhs discussed here is consistent with the instability derived from the consideration of the qhs s energy in @xmath211 .",
    "we also mention that the energy of the vortex becomes a nonzero constant as @xmath40 goes to infinity .",
    "actually , we found that the dependence of the energy on @xmath40 or the filling factor , @xmath56 , is very small .",
    "the color - charge density of the condensate is very small at small filling factors , but the value of the field @xmath216 is never small .",
    "the energy of the soliton is governed by @xmath217 so that the energy never becomes small even as the filling factor becomes small . in this respect",
    ", we can not find any instabilities of the qhs at small filling factors @xmath56 .",
    "but as we expect , the state might be unstable at such a small filling factor because wigner crystal is energetically more stable than the qhs at such small color - charge density of gluons .",
    "we remember that the number difference of positively color - charged quarks and negatively charged quarks is also small in such a case .",
    "thus , for example , the excessive negatively charged quarks form wigner crystal . therefore",
    ", gluons with positive charges also form wigner crystal , not qhs for reducing color coulomb energy ; in the qhs the color charge distribution of the gluons is uniform . accordingly",
    ", it is natural to expect that the qhs at much small filling factor is unstable .      up to now ,",
    "we have considered the ground - state structure of gluons in two - spatial dimension .",
    "this is because the unstable modes are two - dimensional objects and they may form a stable ground state with their condensation .",
    "the unstable modes , in general , depend on all of the coordinates in three dimensions ; @xmath218 with @xmath219 .",
    "but , among them the modes with the largest amplitude as @xmath220 , @xmath221 , depend only on @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "they are two - dimensional objects and form the stable ground state , namely , the qhs of gluons as we have shown . in the derivation of the qhs we have used chern - simons gauge theory , which can be used only in two - dimensional space . in this way we have fully used two - dimensionality of the problem .",
    "we may wonder whether or not unstable modes with small , but nonvanishing @xmath104 ( @xmath224 ) contribute to the ground state structure .",
    "we have a symmetry of the rotation around the magnetic field and of the translation along it .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the ground state should be uniform in @xmath100 direction .",
    "then , the modes should not be important , otherwise their contributions make the ground state nonuniform in the direction .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that three - dimensional effects on the ground state change our main result ; the stable qhs of gluons is realized in the ferromagnetic state ( savvidy vacuum ) .",
    "we also found the gap energy , @xmath225 , above the ground - state energy based on the two - dimensional theory .",
    "the effect of @xmath100 direction is simply that the corresponding mode propagating in the direction gains the energy , @xmath226 .",
    "this is because the relativistic covariance in the direction still remains at least in the limit of infinitely large quark matter ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "we may also wonder whether or not the gap - less mode with @xmath228 exists . in order to see it",
    ", we may assume that the fluctuation @xmath229 does not have dependence on any spatial coordinates .",
    "we found that there is no such solution ; the condition of @xmath230 has been taken into account explicitly in our treatment . therefore , the qhs we have found is really the stable gapped state of the unstable gluons .",
    "until now , quarks do not play any roles for the realization of the ferromagnetic phase except for supplying color charges for the condensate of the gluons .",
    "but , quarks play important roles for the realization of the phase . here , we briefly discuss their roles .    in general , the energy density of the quarks in the magnetic field is smaller than that of the quarks without the magnetic field .",
    "( this fact is favorable to the ferromagnetic state . )",
    "the fact is easily understood intuitively in the case of strong magnetic field .",
    "when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong , all of the quarks occupy the lowest landau level ; their energy is given by @xmath231 where @xmath104 denotes the momentum parallel to the magnetic field of the quarks .",
    "hence , the energy density of the quarks in the strong magnetic field is much lower than that of the quarks without the magnetic field . on the other hand , for sufficiently large number density of the quarks , equivalently , for sufficiently weak magnetic field",
    ", the quarks occupy much higher landau levels .",
    "eventually , both energy densities ( with and without @xmath84 ) approach to each other in the limit of @xmath232 .",
    "actually , we can show that the energy density , @xmath233 , of the quarks in the magnetic field is lower than @xmath234 for any strength of the magnetic field @xmath84 .",
    "thus , both energy densities approach each other very rapidly as @xmath235 ; @xmath236 .    as has been pointed out",
    ", the energy density , @xmath237 , of the superconducting state of the quarks is also lower than @xmath234 due to the condensation of the quark s cooper pairs .",
    "that is , only the quarks in the vicinity of the fermi surface whose width may be given by a gap energy @xmath238 , gain energy @xmath238 by making cooper pairs .",
    "the decrease of the energy density is given such as @xmath239 with the fermi energy @xmath240 ; @xmath241 as @xmath232",
    ". normalizing it by @xmath242 , we find @xmath243 .",
    "thus , the decrease of the energy in the bcs state is slower than that of the energy in the ferromagnetic state when the number density of the quarks increases .",
    "therefore , when the number density of the quarks is sufficiently large , the color superconducting phase is energetically more favored@xcite than the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have also shown that the energy decrease , @xmath244 , of the quark state with the magnetic field is larger than the energy decrease , @xmath245 , of the superconducting state when the number density of the quarks is much small .",
    "thus , the ferromagnetic phase is realized .    in this way",
    ", the quarks play the role of realizing the superconducting phase for sufficiently large chemical potential , while the gluons play the main role of realizing the ferromagnetic phase for the small chemical potential .",
    "the quarks also play the role of realizing the ferromagnetic phase with chemical potential smaller than the one in the above .",
    "the qhs of gluons is realized in quark matter .",
    "the matter can be produced by heavy ion collisions .",
    "the matter produced in the collisions initially has high temperature so that it is in the phase of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "after that , it gradually loses its energy and then enters into the phase of the color ferromagnetic state with the qhs of gluons if the value of the chemical potential is appropriate .",
    "how do we detect whether or not the matter is in the phase ?",
    "we can not observe the color magnetic field , which is confined in the matter .",
    "but we show that the matter in the phase possesses a large observable magnetic moment , in other words , it produces strong observable magnetic fields outside of the matter .",
    "the point is that the difference between the number of positively color - charged quarks and that of negatively charged quarks generates a rotation of the quark matter of the ferromagnetic phase as a whole .",
    "the difference is a result of the realization of the qhs . when the quark matter is not electrically neutral , the rotation generates a magnetic moment .",
    "suppose that the quark matter is composed of up and down quarks , and that the number difference between positively and negatively color - charged quarks is identical in each flavor .",
    "we consider the qhs with @xmath155 .",
    "then , the density difference , @xmath246 , of each flavor is given by the color - charge density of gluons in the qhs ; @xmath247 . a quark with electromagnetic charge",
    "@xmath248 generates a magnetic moment ( @xmath249 ) , which is of the order of @xmath250 in the strong magnetic field @xmath251 .",
    "hence , the magnetization of the quark matter is given by    @xmath252    where we have assumed that the strength of the color - magnetic field is @xmath253 mev and the size of the quark matter is @xmath254 fm .",
    "we have taken the value of @xmath84 as a reference point based on the vacuum fluctuation of @xmath255 .",
    "the observation of this strong magnetic field can be an evidence of the presence of the ferromagnetic phase in the quark matter .",
    "in this paper we have discussed only the case of the su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "similar results hold even in the su(3 ) gauge theory although possible structures of qhss are much richer in su(3 ) case than in su(2 ) case because of the presence of more unstable modes@xcite . a particular point in the su(3 )",
    "gauge theory is the presence of a phase with coexistence of color ferromagnetism and color superconductivity ( so - called 2sc ) at large chemical potential .",
    "this is because the direction of the magnetic field in the color space is normal to the direction of the quark pair condensate .",
    "the details should be referred to our paper@xcite .",
    "quark confinement ( hadron phase ) is caused mainly by gluon s dynamics , namely , the su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "ground state structure of qcd is determined by analyzing non - perturbative dynamics of gluons in the phase .",
    "especially , we need fully dynamical treatment in the gauge theory for revealing the property of the confinement .",
    "the quarks play no dominant roles for the confinement .",
    "for example , in the large @xmath256 expansion of the su(@xmath256 ) gauge theory the confinement is realized at @xmath257-th order of the expansion , in which the quark loops do not arise .",
    "the contribution of the quarks appears in the higher order of the expansion so that the effects of the quarks can be treated perturbatively in the expansion .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of the quarks play an important role for the color superconductivity in the region of large chemical potential of the quark number .",
    "gluons simply give perturbation , an attractive force in an appropriate channel of the quarks ; it makes the fermi gas of free quarks unstable and realizes the superconducting state of the quarks .",
    "the color ferromagnetic phase is realized between the hadron phase and the color superconducting phase when the chemical potential is varied .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that both gluon and quark dynamics play important roles for the phase .",
    "as we have explained , indeed , the gluon dynamics plays the main role in leading to the stable ferromagnetic phase along with quantum hall state of gluons when the quark matter is present .",
    "in such a case , the quark dynamics plays a role of choosing the ferromagnetic phase when the chemical potential is small . on the other hand at large chemical potential",
    "the quark dynamics plays a role of leading to and of choosing the superconducting phase .",
    "in other words , the gluon dynamics plays a main role in realizing the ferromagnetic state at small chemical potential , while the quark dynamics plays a main role in realizing the color superconducting state at large chemical potential .",
