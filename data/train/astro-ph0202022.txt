    "one of the main goals of the xmm large - scale structure survey ( xmm lss ) ( @xcite ) is to map the large - scale distribution of x - ray selected galaxy clusters out to a redshift of @xmath0 and to detect the richest clusters out to a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "since the detection of faint , extended sources from x - ray data is a crucial part of the xmm lss project , an efficient and reliable source detection method must be implemented for the survey .",
    "previous investigations ( @xcite ) have invoked simplified source field setups and left out some instrumental effects , when studying the efficiency of various detection algorithms on simulated xmm images and estimating , e.g. , completeness and confusion limits . by using schematic as well as more realistic source fields and by a more complete treatment of instrumental effects through the xmm science simulator software scisim ( which mimics the performance of xmm by ray - tracing incoming photons through the mirror and detector systems ) ,",
    "we extend this earlier work and address additional questions , like    * what is the optimum energy band for distant cluster detection in xmm lss data ?",
    "* how does cluster x - ray morphology and off - axis distance influence detection and photometric reconstruction of source properties ? *",
    "how does one deal effectively with , e.g. , blending of extended and pointlike sources and removal of bright point sources ?    here",
    "we present a few simulated 10 ksec xmm epic images being used for comparing and developing source detection procedures for the xmm large scale structure survey .",
    "three types of objects are considered , agn type 1 and 2 and groups / clusters .",
    "point source ( i.e.  agn ) fluxes and object types are based on the x - ray background ( xrb ) synthesis model of @xcite , down to a limiting flux of @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 0.52 kev ) .",
    "this xrb model is consistent with the projected cumulative number density @xmath5 of sources as a function of x - ray flux @xmath6 ( the logn - logs relation ) as derived from deep xmm ( @xcite ) and chandra ( @xcite ) observations . for clusters and groups ,",
    "fluxes are provided by the assumed mass - temperature ( @xmath7 ; see below ) and luminosity - temperature ( @xmath8 ) relations down to @xmath9 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 0.52 kev ) .",
    "we have produced two sets of simulations , distinguished only by the assumed cluster properties . in the first set ,",
    "clusters are drawn from standard press - schechter ( p - s ) realizations of halos in a flat @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "they are extracted from 100 monte carlo realizations of the redshift interval @xmath14 down to a mass floor of @xmath15 m@xmath16 , assuming the @xmath7 relation of @xcite and a non - evolving ( local ) cluster @xmath8 relation of @xmath17 ( @xcite ) with no intrinsic dispersion . to incorporate the observed @xmath8 dispersion as well as the steepening of the @xmath8 relation at low @xmath18 ( @xmath19 kev ) ,",
    "cluster fluxes are `` corrected '' for these effects by assuming @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the standard deviation of a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath22 . for @xmath23 kev , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "is assumed ( consistent with results from rosat cluster surveys , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 is taken for @xmath28 kev , based on galaxy group observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster flux limit of @xmath9 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 is imposed hereafter .",
    "the second set of simulations is based on a cosmological n - body simulation , from which five fields covering @xmath29 deg@xmath30 and the redshift interval @xmath31 were extracted . except for @xmath32 ,",
    "other parameters are as above .",
    "clusters are identified among the @xmath33 dark matter particles in each field via a friends - of - friends algorithm ( where gravitationally unbound particles are removed ) and drawn from a random @xmath34 sight line through one of the fields .",
    "the @xmath8 relation , including scatter as above , is here assumed to evolve such as to mimic no evolution in an ( @xmath35 ) universe , i.e.@xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the luminosity distance in an @xmath38 universe and @xmath39 is the corresponding value in an @xmath40 cosmology .",
    "a low - redshift cut at @xmath41 is imposed for computational reasons , excluding @xmath1% and @xmath42% of the input clusters from the p - s and n - body calculations , respectively ( i.e.  in most lss fields , such nearby groups / clusters will not appear ) .",
    "agn are assumed to be pointlike , whereas cluster surface brightness distributions follow a 2-d @xmath43profile of core radius @xmath44 .",
    "since there is to some extent a degeneracy in the observational determination of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we choose to fix @xmath44 and let only @xmath43 vary . for each cluster",
    ", values of @xmath43 and the ratio @xmath45 between minor and major isophote axis are drawn from observed distributions ( @xcite ) , assuming these to be gaussians of mean 0.65 and @xmath46 ( @xmath43 ) , and mean 0.80 , @xmath47 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath44 is fixed at 1/4 of the cluster radius , which is determined through the angular diameter distance relation assuming x - ray emission out to @xmath48 . the latter is directly provided by the simulations in the n - body case , while it is calculated for the p - s clusters in the point mass approximation .",
    "groups and clusters are each represented by an ensemble of point sources spaced @xmath49 apart , i.e.  well below the on - axis psf of fwhm @xmath50 ( the in - flight measured mean value for the three x - ray telescopes at @xmath51 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "all sources are assigned a spectrum , with normalizations provided by the xrb model for point sources and by the p - s / n - body simulations for clusters .",
    "the latter are assigned an xspec - based _ mekal _ spectrum of metallicity @xmath52 , with temperature and redshift provided by the cosmological simulations . for the agn ,",
    "a power law spectrum is assumed , i.e.  @xmath53 . in consistency with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "we choose @xmath54 for agn1 , while agn2 are assigned a value @xmath55 and an intrinsic h  i column density of 10@xmath56 @xmath3 .",
    "given the spectral normalization in one band of the xrb model ( e.g.  0.5 - 2 kev ) this choice of spectra approximately reproduces the point source density predicted in the other model bands ( 2 - 10 and 5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "a uniform diffuse x - ray background is added , modeled as a sum of two power laws . from fits to xrb observations we choose @xmath57 and a normalization @xmath58 at @xmath59 kev of 9.0 kev @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 kev@xmath4 for the power law dominating the xrb spectrum above @xmath60 kev .",
    "this effectively acts in the simulations as the integrated contribution of sources fainter than our adopted flux limit . a second power law of @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "is also included , to account for the observed excess of emission at low energies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) compared to that expected from the @xmath57 power law .",
    "adding this component also ensures an overall 1 kev normalization of 10.0 kev @xmath3 s@xmath4 sr@xmath4 kev@xmath4 , consistent with most xrb measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both individual sources and the x - ray background are subjected to a uniform absorbing column density of @xmath63 @xmath3 , which is the mean value expected for the xmm lss 10 ksec pointings . on top of this",
    "the in - orbit measured particle and internal background is added , using normalizations as given in the xmm - newton users handbook and spectra roughly modeled as power laws including gaussian representations of the four and two most prominent lines for the pn and mos cameras , respectively ( see also @xcite ; a more detailed background model is soon to be implemented ) .",
    "this background component is not subject to mirror vignetting and hence not included in the input to scisim .",
    "simulated data are created for the epic mos and pn ccd s ( with thin filters ) using an exposure time of 10 ks , with all ccd s in full frame mode .",
    "spacecraft effects such as drift and jitter are neglected .",
    "the output of scisim is , in accordance with real xmm data , in the form of observation data files ( odf s ) which include photon event files for each detector and ccd chip .",
    "images and exposure maps are created from the event files using the xmm science analysis system ( xmmsas ) .    for illustration purposes a source field image",
    "is produced for each simulation .",
    "these are convolved with a @xmath64 gaussian and have image borders conforming to the field of view covered by the epic pn ccd s .",
    "in figures  [ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig1 ] and [ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig2 ] we present examples of simulated epic images . these are `` raw '' 10 ksec photon count images , produced using the latest version ( v3.0.0 ) of scisim with the xmm current calibration files as of dec 11 , 2001 , and with the p - s prescription for extended sources (  [ jrasmussen - wa3_sec : flux ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding input source field is shown in figure  [ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig3 ] . in this particular representation , most clusters are `` group - like '' , with only two of the 12 input clusters having temperatures @xmath65 kev . the brightest one , a @xmath66 kev cluster at @xmath67 with a 0.52 kev flux of @xmath68 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 , stands out in the lower left corner .",
    "based on the simulated images , we have done preliminary tests of the performance of the wavelet  based xmmsas source detection task _ ewavelet _ , using wavelet scales of 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 pixels , and a detection significance threshold of @xmath69 .",
    "this method was chosen as a starting point because it was demonstrated to work reasonably well for the simulated xmm images of @xcite , and in this case , loosely judged , achieved optimum performance with the above parameters .",
    "a result of running this specific setup of _ ewavelet _ on the 0.52 kev image of fig .",
    "[ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig1 ] is illustrated in figure  [ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig4 ] , showing the wavelet - reconstructed image .",
    "inspection of this image readily shows that four extended sources have been `` detected '' . comparing the result with the input source field in fig .",
    "[ jrasmussen - wa3_fig : fig3 ] reveals that one of these extended sources ( the most central one ) is actually two point sources blended together , whereas another results from the blending of two _ extended _ sources ( this is not surprising , as one of these blended clusters is quite faint , being just above the adopted input flux limit of @xmath9 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the brightest cluster mentioned above is safely detected , and a relatively faint ( @xmath70 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) , @xmath71 kev cluster at @xmath72 is also found .",
    "the remaining extended sources are apparently either too faint , too far off - axis ( clearly the case for at least five of them ) , or suffer too much blending with bright point sources to be detected in this case .",
    "we further note in passing that the number of point sources detected roughly corresponds to half the input number  and this will certainly improve when including the results based on the 210 kev image .",
    "the simulated 10 ksec epic images , examples of which have been shown in this paper , will provide a baseline for testing and optimizing cluster detection procedures for the xmm large scale structure survey .",
    "this will , among other things , allow us to firmly address the questions posed in the introduction .",
    "the detection of the @xmath73 cluster described above seems particularly promising with respect to achieving our goal of finding high - redshift galaxy clusters , as it suggests that at least certain , reasonably massive but distant ( @xmath74 ) clusters could be well within the reach of detection in the xmm lss survey ( and other blank field xmm exposures of similar depth ) .",
    "it should also be emphasized in this context that work still remains in order to optimize the method described here for the specific case of our simulated images .",
    "a comprehensive analysis is currently being carried out involving additional detection algorithms , and we are also testing how selected methods for image restoration ( including the publicly available version of the pixon code ; http://www.pixon.com ) prior to source detection may improve detection performance .",
    "further plans for the near future include testing source detection on deeper simulated exposures and to study how combining partially overlapping exposures will enhance detection .",
    "results of this work will be presented in a forthcoming paper ."
