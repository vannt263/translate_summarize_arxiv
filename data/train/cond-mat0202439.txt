    "it is well - known , from the study of the infra - red divergence problem in relativistic qed , that a charged particle can not be separated from its _ classical _ field @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is known also that the motion of a classical particle can not be described correctly , if the interaction with the self - generated field is not taken into account properly @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the effects induced by the self - generated _ classical _ ( _ i.e. _ coherent ) field on a stationary current flowing in a macroscopic quantum conductor . in particular we will estimate the contribution to the total energy of the system due to the _ classical _ magnetic field and to its interaction with the current .",
    "the analysis will concern explicitly two geometrically different models . in both cases",
    "we will obtain the remarkable result that the magnetic energy associated to the current is essentially negative .",
    "a completely different result would be obtained for a current due to a system of classical charged particles .",
    "such a difference descends from the fact that , in classical mechanics , the kinetic energy of a particle is expressed , in a natural way , in terms of the velocity .",
    "we remark that the velocity is essentially a classical concept . in quantum mechanics",
    "the velocity of an electron corresponds to the following operator    @xmath0 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the _ classical _ vector potential .",
    "owing to the presence of @xmath2 , which depends on the other particles of the system as well as on the external environment , the velocity @xmath3 , given by eq.(1 ) , is essentially a collective operator . on the other hand ,",
    "the canonical momentum is connected directly to the particle wave - length , which in turn is involved by a boundary condition like periodicity . for these reasons",
    "it looks more proper , in our opinion , to analyse a quantum many - body system in terms of the canonical momenta and not in terms of the velocities of the particles .",
    "as previously mentioned , in this paper we will obtain the result that the magnetic self - interaction energy of a quantum current is essentially negative .",
    "this result may have unexpected consequences concerning _",
    "e.g. _ the ground state of a system of electrons subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , as it will be discussed in the sequel , it is conceivable that , under appropriate conditions , a physical situation corresponding to a spontaneous current may be favoured with respect to a current - less situation .",
    "we recall that attempts to explain superconductivity in terms of spontaneous currents have been made long ago by heisenberg @xcite and by born and cheng @xcite .",
    "however such theories have been ruled out by a theorem by bloch @xcite , owing to the lack , in our opinion , of a proper analysis of the magnetic self - interaction .",

    "@xmath7 has been splitted into two contributions . the first one , which will be called _ canonical",

    "the spin magnetization - density has been neglected , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the _ classical _ potential @xmath1 is solution to the maxwell equation    @xmath11    with the transverse electric field given by    @xmath12    both eq.(6 ) and eq.(7 ) can be obtained , in the framework of qed , by use of the coherent - state formalism @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the interaction of the system with the _ classical _ field , neglecting any residual interaction with the quantum field ( uncoherent photon emission and reabsorption ) . in this approximation ,",
    "a simple expression for the conserved total energy of the whole system ( matter plus _ classical _ field ) can be given , in the form :    @xmath13 \\vert \\psi \\rangle + ( { \\epsilon } _ 0 / 2 ) \\int d \\bm{r } \\ , ( \\vert   { \\bm{e } } _ { \\perp c } { \\vert } ^2 + c^2 \\vert { \\bm{b } } _ c { \\vert } ^2 ) .\\ ] ]    it can be verified easily that @xmath14 is conserved .",

    "the last term can be neglected , for a finite system . by use of this result",
    "we obtain from eq.(8 )    @xmath17    we notice the absence of any contribution due to @xmath18 .",

    "the following relation    @xmath39    has been used in the derivation of eq.(14 ) .",
    "eq.(14 ) gives an expression for the flux @xmath40 in terms of @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ in terms of the total angular momentum @xmath41",
    ".    for this model the magnetic energy @xmath42 , defined in eq.(12 ) , is negative :    @xmath43",
    "now let us consider a second model , consisting of a long , thin cylindrical conductor , with a current flowing along it .",
    "let @xmath22 be the length and @xmath44 the radius , with @xmath45 .",
    "we assume an uniform stationary _ canonical _ current , flowing inside the conductor , given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the canonical momentum per electron ( in this case the total number of electrons is given by @xmath48 ) .",
    "for a very long conductor we may assume that @xmath1 is approximately oriented in the direction of the current ( z - direction ) and that it depends , approximately , on the distance @xmath49 from the axis of the cylinder only .",

    "it is independent of geometric details and coincides with the r.h.s . of eq.(17 ) obtained for the previous model .",
    "such a coincidence ascribes a sort of universality to this result . in the derivation of eq.(28 )",
    "the following identity    @xmath76    has been used .",
    "let @xmath77 be the ground - state energy for a system of electrons , in the absence of current .",
    "let @xmath78 be the variation for @xmath79 , corresponding to a translation in momentum space , assuming that such a translation is allowed by the electron state . according to eq.(12 ) , the corresponding variation for the total energy of the system",
    "is given by      since the magnetic energy @xmath42 is negative , a physical situation , in which @xmath81 is negative , is possible .",
    "in such a case the true ground state of the system would be characterized by a spontaneous current , as supposed in ref.s @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it can be demonstrated that , as a consequence of eq.(28 ) , the ground state of a system of electrons in a periodic potential , with periodic boundary conditions , is _ at least _ degenerate , up to finite - size effects .",
    "in fact , let @xmath82 be the ground state of @xmath6 and let @xmath83 be the corresponding eigenvalue",
    ". in the state @xmath84 the total canonical momentum , as well as the total current , vanish .",
    "let @xmath85 be the state obtained from @xmath84 through a rigid translation in momentum space            the possibility for @xmath89 is investigated , for the sake of simplicity , in the case of a system of bloch electrons in a conducting band .",
    "however a similar analysis could be applied , in principle , to more complicated electron states . in this simple case we have              and correspondingly @xmath94 and vanishing current . however , owing to the negative value of @xmath42 , it may happen that the solution given in eq.(35 ) is unstable , when the magnetic interaction is switched on .",
    "in fact let us consider the following distribution function      obtained from @xmath96 through a shift of the argument .",
    "we observe that the transformation of the distribution function given in eq.(36 ) represents a sort of _ energy - weighted _ translation in momentum space , not a rigid one as given in eq.(31 ) . in this case",
    "we have                        where the expression @xmath107 has been used for the fermi momentum @xmath108 .",
