    "the presence of both massive ( @xmath0 ) black holes in the centers nearby elliptical galaxies ( kormendy and richstone 1995 ) and extensive atmospheres of @xmath1 kev gas ( trinchieri , fabbiano , and canizares 1986 ) suggest that these galaxies should also possess central point x - ray sources of luminosities of @xmath2 erg sec@xmath3 associated with the accretion of gas onto the black hole . in reality",
    "these galaxies exhibit x - ray luminosities @xmath4 of this magnitude , including the contribution from the hot galactic atmosphere ( pellegrini 1999 ) .",
    "this fact has motivated the development of scenarios where accretion onto the central black hole occurs via `` advection - dominated accretion accretion flows '' ( adafs ) ( narayan and yi 1995 ; abramowicz 1995 ; dimatteo 2000 ) . by means of poor collisional coupling between very hot ions and radiatively efficient electrons , and the presumption of a coexisting wind or outflow ( blandford and begelman 1999 )",
    ", such scenarios result in accretion onto the black hole at a small fraction of the bondi ( 1952 ) rate , producing a correspondingly small x - ray luminosity .",
    "furthermore , hard power - law components ( photon index @xmath5 ) detected in the x - ray spectra of six nearby giant elliptical galaxies with radio - quiet cores have been suggested to be produced by an adaf atmosphere around their central black holes ( allen , dimatteo , and fabian 2000 , hereafter adf2000 ) .",
    "these spectra are for the entire galaxies , and although contamination from from galactic x - ray binaries is possible , adf2000 suggest that the power - laws exhibited in the spectra are significantly harder than that produced by x - ray binaries or from standard agn . if these hard power - laws really are black hole - adaf signatures , then based on the adf2000 estimates for their photon indices and normalizations they could appear as relatively strong point sources in the hri : although the adaf mechanism can supress a very large x - ray brightness , in principle it can still be detected .",
    "some of these galaxies offer circumstantial evidence of nuclear activity .",
    "the hri analysis of m87 by reynolds ( 1996 ) and harris ( 1998 ) combined with the adf2000 spectral analysis make a plausible case for the association of m87 s hard power - law tail with a massive black hole adaf ( see adf2000 ) .",
    "m87 also posesses a prominent x - ray and radio jet , thus energetic activity associated with a central source is clearly indicated .",
    "the cores of ngc 1399 , 4636 , and 4696 are much weaker in radio power than m87 ( slee 1994 ) .",
    "we consider whether the preponderance of the observed hard x - ray emission in some of the galaxies discussed in adf2000 should be attributed to a massive black hole - adaf .",
    "dimatteo ( 1999 ; hereafter d99 ) determined upper limits for three of these galaxies , ngcs 4472 , 4636 , and 4649 ; these were comparable to the fluxes in the case of ngcs 4472 and 4649 , but in the case of ngc 4636 the hri upper limit was a factor of two lower than the measurement . in this article",
    "we present analysis of hri images of additional adaf candidates from the list of the adf2000 galaxies , ngcs 1399 , 4696 , as well as ngc 4636 .",
    "we find that the upper limit for the flux of a central point x - ray source in each of these galaxies as determined by the hri data is either smaller than the predicted flux inferred from the asca spectra , or only marginally consistent .",
    "our result for ngc 4636 is comparable to that determined by d99 , , lower than the inferred flux by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if adaf sources associated with central black holes exist in these galaxies , they can only account for only a fraction of the hard power - law x - ray emission observed in the galaxies spectra .",
    "the observations were obtained from the heasarc data archive , and are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the observations were subjected to the `` dewobbling '' recipe described in the user guide ( 1998 ) in order to improve the spatial resolution of the hri image .",
    "this procedure groups the hri photons by phase bins of the telescope s @xmath7 sec wobble period , determines a separate image for each of these phase bins , and then reassembles the images to a common image centroid .",
    "we have checked whether this scheme recovers the /hri point source response function : in the case of ngcs 1399 and 4636 , point sources within a few arcmin of the hri field center appear to have a corrected fwhm of @xmath8 . therefore we have used this fwhm for the convolution of the model galactic surface brightness , including a central point source ( see  3 ) . in the case of ngc 4696 , there is no point source of sufficient strength within the hri image field to check the recovery of the hri resolution , so we have assumed a 6fwhm for model fitting .",
    "the effective observation times are calculated from the good time intervals covered by the list of wobble phases used to compose the dewobbled image .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figures 4 - 6 shows the 2 - 10 kev flux and photon index @xmath9 for the power - law components determined by adf2000 ( including 90% confidence limits on a single interesting parameter ) compared to our upper limits for the flux determined from the hri count rates for a central point source , as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "these pimms estimates are shown for the column absorption densities given by the maximum value of either stark ( 1992 ) or the best - fit values derived from analysis of pspc spectra ( davis and white    1996 ; see table 2 ) .",
    "we note that for all three galaxies the optimal values for the flux and photon index fall above our hri upper flux limits , including effects of absorption , although the large uncertainties in photon index allow for marginal consistency between the values and the upper flux limits ( ngc 1399 ) .",
    "adaf models for the hard x - ray emission component suggest a photon index of @xmath10 , and the ensemble average of results for the putative adaf power law components is @xmath11 ( adf2000 ) .",
    "our results indicate that for ngcs 1399 and 4696 photon indices @xmath12 are ruled out unless the flux from a putative adaf is a fraction ( @xmath13 ) of the power - law component . in the case of ngc 4636",
    ", our result approximately agrees with an earlier analysis by d99 , namely that at the optimal photon index the hri upper limit for the flux is significantly lower ( here a factor of @xmath6 ) than the measured flux , including the effects of measured absorption . unlike the other two galaxies , photon indices @xmath14 for the power - law component",
    "are ruled out . a `` universal '' photon index of @xmath11 to describe the bulk of the hard x - ray emission from an adaf source in all three of these galaxies is not consistent with the hri upper flux limits . in the case of ngc 4636 ,",
    "the larger photon index may be consistent with the presence of a significant contribution in the power - law component from other sources , such as binary x - ray sources .",
    "adf2000 noted that extrapolation of the @xmath15 relation of fabbiano and trinchieri ( 1985 ) measured for irregular and spiral galaxies of the power - law components of ngcs 1399 and 4636 was consistent with substantial contribution from x - ray binaries , stars , and an agn . in the case of ngc 1399",
    "there is also some indication that the hard component may be spatially distributed .",
    "jones ( 1997 ) found that the pspc spectrum for the region outside a @xmath16core of the galaxy was best fit with a @xmath17 kev and a harder @xmath18 kev two - temperature plasma model , while the core was well described by a single temperature plasma of @xmath17 kev .",
    "this outer region overlaps with the 6circular extraction region for the gis used in the analysis of this galaxy by adf2000 .",
    "adf2000 also suggest that the flat photon indices measured for these sources by are central adafs with intrinsic photon indices of @xmath10 , flattened by anomalously high absorption along the cores of these galaxies of @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "however , such an excess is not indicated from pspc observations of davis and white ( 1996 ) , nor is excess absorption is observed by the pspc in giant elliptical galaxies containing cooling inflows located at low galactic column , such as ngc 1399 ( jones 1997 ; david 1994 ) .",
    "buote ( 2000 ) has suggested a resolution of the disagreement between the and column estimates by oxygen absorption at @xmath21 kev caused by a warm component of gas in the core of ngc 1399 , associated with mass dropout in the cooling inflow .",
    "as all three of the galaxies we consider here have cooling inflows , we leave it as a possibility that this effect has supressed the brightness of their central adafs as observed by the /hri .",
    "we present the hri spatial analysis of the central regions of three nearby giant elliptical galaxies in which hard power - law components have been detected in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we find the overlap of error regions for the power - law flux and photon indices with our hri - determined 99% confidence upper flux limits for a central point source is either marginal or small for all three galaxies . thus associating the entirety of this hard x - ray component with a central x - ray source ( like an massive black - hole adaf ) is unlikely , unless anomalously high absorption , possibly related to the cooling inflows in the cores of each of these galaxies , absorbs a substantial amount of the adaf x - ray flux in the passband .",
    "otherwise , if we require that the range of possible values of @xmath9 as determined by adf2000 is consistent with our upper limits for the galaxies flux , then the flux attributed to the central source can only be a fraction of the measured flux for the observed power - law component .",
