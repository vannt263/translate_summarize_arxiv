    "absorption systems identified in quasar spectra are classified as `` quasar - associated '' or `` intervening '' absorbers based on the nature of absorbing materials .",
    "compared to the origin of intervening absorbers which are produced by absorbing materials , such as intergalactic clouds or galaxies , located far from the background quasars , the origin of quasar - associated absorbers is much more complicated .",
    "while most quasar - associated absorbers are produced by materials associated with the agn environments , a significant fraction may also be associated with agn outflows .",
    "therefore , quasar - associated absorbers uniquely trace a variety of regions in agns and their host galaxies , and their processes are closely connected to the basic physics of the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) growth and agn evolution ( hamann & sabra 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) are the most prominent quasar - associated absorbers because of their high velocities ( up to a velocity of @xmath3 ) and broad widths ( at least 2000 km  s@xmath4  wide ; see weymann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ) .",
    "bals appear in the spectra of @xmath5 of optically selected quasars , and often show absorption from a wide range of species , such as , and , to , , and ( hall et al .",
    "2002 ; tolea et al .",
    "2002 ; hewett & foltz 2003 ; reichard et al . 2003 ; trump et al . 2006",
    "; gibson et al . 2009 ; zhang et al . 2010 , 2014 ) .",
    "bals are clearly formed by gas outflows from the agn central engine .",
    "the accretion of gaseous material onto the central smbhs releases a large amount of radiative and kinetic energy to heat and expel the surrounding gas and accelerates the outflowing gas to very high velocities , producing very broad velocity profiles in the absorption lines ( see antonuccio - delogu & silk 2010 for a recent review ) . besides the high velocities and broad line profiles , bal quasars show remarkably weak soft x - ray emission ( e.g. , green & mathur 1996 ) , with @xmath6 times less soft x - ray flux than that for unabsorbed quasars ( e.g. , brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) .",
    "the apparent x - ray absorption probably implies intrinsic extinction in bals .",
    "previous statistical studies of optically selected bal quasars indicate that high - ionization bal ( hibal ) quasars as a population are not heavily reddened ( @xmath7 ) while low - ionization bal ( lobal ) quasars show a moderate level of reddening with the average color excess of @xmath8 ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; gibson et al . 2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "both hibal and lobal quasars often show intrinsic dust reddening following the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) type as do intervening quasar absorption line systems ( reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; york et al .",
    "2006 ) , unlike the milky way ( mw ) type dust reddening which possesses the remarkable and intriguing broad 2175   bump in the uv extinction curve ( stecher 1965 ) .",
    "the bump strength increases gradually from the smc type curve to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) like curve to the mw type curve ( savage & mathis 1979 ; fitzpatrick 1989 ) .",
    "detections of 2175   features in high redshift ( @xmath9 ) quasar absorption line systems were first reported by wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . since then , over 40 2175   bumps have been found in high redshift quasar metal absorption systems , such as and ( e.g. , wild et al . 2006 ; srianand et al . 2008 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 , 2014 ; zhou et al . 2010 ; jiang et al . 2010a , b ; 2011 ; wang et al .",
    "2012 ) . despite the existence of some",
    "known 2175    bumps in quasar absorption line systems , they are extremely rare ( york et al .",
    "they may be expected to be even more rare in regions near quasars because the carrier of the bump may not survive in the harsh uv environment close to the quasars . indeed , only 6 quasar - associated 2175    absorbers are found .",
    "the measurements of metal absorption lines associated with da  suggest that the dust depletion in these absorbers is similar to that measured in cold interstellar clouds of the mw ( e.g. jenkins 2009 and references therein ) , which are characterized by cold , dense and primarily molecular gas ( jiang et al .",
    "2010a , b ; zhou et al . 2010",
    "; wang et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this result could indicate that the carriers in these high redshift da  are likely the same as those responsible for the uv bumps in the mw and lmc .",
    "although the origin of the 2175   bump remains unclear 50 years after its discovery ( stecher 1965 ) , carbonaceous materials have long been proposed as a candidate ; a probable carrier is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , the suspected source of spectral features of which are abundant in the mw ( draine 2003 ; wang et al .",
    "if this is the case , then the 2175   bump can be detected in the quasar environment .",
    "for instance , the bal winds can efficiently absorb the high - energy photons from the central engine of quasars to allow survival of the pah molecules or other carriers .",
    "extreme ultraviolet and x - ray photons can easily destroy pah molecules ( voit 1992 ; murray et al .",
    "detections of the unidentified emission signatures in the mid - infrared spectra of six iron low - ionization bal ( felobal ) quasars imply that carbonaceous molecules can survive in the environments of bal quasars ( farrah et al .",
    "however , there is no previous direct evidence of the coexistence of bals and da  in quasar spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of seven possible da  in the optical spectra of bal quasars detected in the sloan digital sky survey iii ( eisenstein et al .",
    "the spectral analysis results are described in  2 , discussions about the false detections are presented in  3 and 4 and conclusions and discussions are summarized in  5 .",
    "the spectra of these seven objects were observed in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; dawson et al .",
    "2013 ) of the third stage of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 ) on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al . 2006 ) at apache point observatory ( apo ) in the sacramento mountains in southern new mexico . to constrain baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ,",
    "boss is designed to complete a spectroscopic survey of a larger volume than all of the previous spectroscopic surveys , including 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as @xmath10 with redshifts @xmath11 and more than 150,000 quasar spectra ( @xmath12 ) over the redshift range @xmath13 .",
    "the improved boss spectrographs ( smee et al . 2013 ) can observe spectra of targets two magnitudes fainter than the original sdss spectrographs .",
    "the calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region of 3,600 - 10,500   at a spectral resolution in the range of @xmath14 .",
    "the quasar - associated da  are rarely detected , and the generally steep extinction curve ( fynbo et al .",
    "2013 ; jiang et al .",
    "2013 ) makes some objects fainter .",
    "thus the bal quasars with quasar - associated da  are rarer due to the additional dust reddening in the bal clouds and their small percentage in the quasar population .",
    "nevertheless , the improved survey sensitivity of boss allows detection of fainter objects with high - redshift in a larger volume than the original sdss , offering a much larger sample of high redshift quasars to search for rare da .",
    "our initial exploration of da , among absorption line systems on quasar spectra in the sdss dr10 ( ahn et al .",
    "2014 ) , led to identification of excess broad band absorption near 2250    in seven bal quasars .",
    "searching procedure of the bump exploration has three steps , and we briefly outline it here .",
    "firstly , we construct a sample of absorbers from the sdss dr10 quasar catalog ( pris et al . 2013 ) .",
    "absorbers are identified by a semi - automatic algorithm following the method of lawther et al .",
    "absorbers have been visually inspected and some unusual absorption lines like those in hall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are removed .",
    "based on the wavelength coverage of the boss spectrographs and the color distribution of da  found by jiang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , 7950 strong absorbers with absorption redshifts of @xmath15 and relative colors of @xmath16 , are collected as the parent sample of the exploration of da .",
    "secondly , we use a quasar composite spectrum reddened by a parameterized extinction curve ( introduced in  2.2 ) to fit the observed spectra in the rest frame of absorption systems .",
    "this method is similar to the pair - method commonly used in studies of dust extinction of the mw diffuse clouds .",
    "thirdly , we perform an independent verification approach to gauge the significance of the extinction bumps using a simulation technique developed by jiang et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ; also see the last paragraph of  2.4 ) .",
    "the bumps with a significance level of @xmath17 are considered as false candidates to be rejecting . after performing a visual examination and rejecting the false signals mimicked by greatly trimmed in the sdss spectral data ,",
    "we finally obtain 225 2175   absorber candidates . among them , 25 cases are quasar - associated 2175   absorbers , and we find the absorption troughs of bals in the spectra of 7 objects .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra of these seven bal quasars , and the fitting results of bumps in bal quasars are presented in  2.3 .      in the mw",
    "ism studies , dust extinction curves of diffuse clouds are extracted by comparing a pair of stellar spectra of the same spectral type , one of which is reddened and the other unreddened ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "since our technique to extract the extinction curves from quasar spectra is similar to the pair - method , we denoted our technique the `` quasar spectrum pair method '' . in this method , the spectrum of the target is fit using the sdss dr7 quasar composite spectrum ( jiang et al .",
    "2011 ) reddened by a parameterized extinction curve ( fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ) at the optical / uv wavebands in the rest frame of the absorber of interest .",
    "the extinction curve @xmath18 is constituted by a linear background and a drude component , representing the underlying extinction and the potential 2175   bump , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is in units of inverse microns ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "two parameters ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) define the linear background .",
    "the drude profile is defined by three parameters , ( 1 ) the position ( in @xmath21 ) of the bump peak , @xmath24 ; ( 2 ) the full width at half maximum ( in @xmath21 ) of the bump , @xmath25 ; and ( 3 ) the drude profile scale factor , @xmath26 .",
    "the strength of the bump can be described by the area under the drude profile , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the bump strength defined in fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) and gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . unlike the mw ism studies",
    ", we do not know the intrinsic spectral slope and luminosity of the unreddened spectrum .",
    "we can not measure the conventional extinction parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) from the extinction curve , derived by the comparison of the quasar spectra with the composite spectrum .",
    "thus , @xmath18 is a relative extinction curve without normalization .",
    "furthermore , the linear background also accounts for the variation of the intrinsic quasar spectral slopes and fluxes , and @xmath23 could be negative if a quasar spectrum is bluer than the composite spectrum .",
    "however , the aim of this work is to unveil the extinction bump in the quasar spectra , and the features of the extinction bump will remain the same regardless of intrinsic quasar variability . more details can be found in jiang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .      in the fitting process of these seven bal quasars ,",
    "only the continuum of a quasar spectrum was fitted while the regions with strong emission lines , such as ly@xmath32 , , , and , and known strong bals ( gray curves in figure [ f1 ] ) are masked without fitting .",
    "the potential excess broad band absorption is set to have the same redshift as the quasar s emission redshift to detect the quasar - associated absorbers .",

    "are presented with the sdss - iii / boss spectrum ( black curves ) in panel ( a ) . to emphasize the requirement of a bump on the extinction curve",

    "figure [ f2 ] illustrates the distribution of the absorption feature parameters and the relative extinction curves of the seven candidates .",
    "for comparison , figure [ f2 ] also includes the bumps and the extinction curves observed in the mw ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ; green circles and curves ) and lmc ( gordon et al . 2003 ; red circles and curves ) .",
    "the peak position of the bump in the mw is nearly constant , and the bump width varies in a wide range of @xmath33 .",
    "however , 7 cases in this work present broader absorption features at smaller wavenumbers ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36  ) , and their bump strengths are much weaker than those of the mw bumps on average , but similar to those of the lmc bumps .",
    "the excess broad band absorbers are possibly related to the 2175   bump detected in our milky way and other galaxies .",
    "the different distributions are possibly attributed to variations in chemical composition of the grains ( draine 2003 ) . for convenience ,",
    "hereafter , we use the term excess broad band absorbers ( ebba ) to refer to this new class of absorbers near 2250  .      in order to confirm the existence of the ebba bumps",
    ", we perform continuum fitting by reddening the dr7 composite spectrum with different extinction curves , namely that from the smc , the lmc2 supershell ( hereafter lmc2 ) , the lmc ( gordon et al . 2003 ) and the mw ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) .",
    "the 2175   bump is absent in the smc extinction curve and gradually increases from the lmc2 extinction curve to the lmc and the mw extinction curves .",
    "there are two free parameters in the continuum fitting : @xmath31 and a normalization scale .",

    "all objects show that the fitting reddened by a parameterized extinction curve is significantly better than those reddened by the smc , lmc , lmc2 and mw extinction relations .    considering that bal quasars on average have redder continua and stronger uv and optical emission than non - bal quasars ( e.g. , boroson & meyers 1992 ; zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) , a few of the strongest and emission objects may be accidently identified as da  ( pitman et al . 2000 ) . to check the validity of the detections of the ebba  bumps , we refit the spectra with the composite spectrum of hibal quasars from reichard et al .",
    "the fitting results are shown by red lines ( solid and dashed ) in panel ( a ) of figure [ f1 ] and in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the hibal composite spectrum shows a redder continuum slope and stronger uv multiplets near the regime than the dr7 quasar composite spectrum .",
    "the derived fitting parameters are somewhat different from the results using the dr7 composite spectrum .",
    "the hibal fitting results show slightly stronger ebba  bumps for all of the targets except sdss j135734.05 + 364005.1 , confirming the detections of the bump .",
    "the maximal variability of the derived bump strengths reaches @xmath37 , indicating the level of uncertainties in the measured bump strengths due to the use of the different spectral template . nevertheless , the anomalous absorption features are still clearly present .    to measure the significance level of the detections , which can also quantitatively assess the probability of false positives , we have compared the seven bal quasar spectra with a control sample of 200 quasar spectra using the simulation technique developed by jiang et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) .",

    "this confusion could occur numerous iron absorption systems cover the same broad wavelength regime as the bump , and some lines even coincidently lie near the bump peak position . to investigate the existence of absorption , we calculated a series of models using the photoionization code cloudy ( c10.00 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) with different ionization parameters and hydrogen column densities , adopting the ionizing continuum from mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) and an electron density of @xmath139 @xmath140 .",
    "in addition , the default 16-level fe atom is used . in the top panel of figure [ f3 ] , the ionization parameter ( @xmath141 )",
    "is varied between -0.5 to -3.0 with a dex step of 0.5 , and the highest column density is chosen to be @xmath142 @xmath143 . in the bottom panel of figure [ f3 ] , the highest column density ( @xmath144 ) is set between 22 and 24 with a dex step of 1.0 , and the ionization parameter is chosen to be @xmath145 .",
    "the calculations suggest that the iron absorption troughs around 2400    ( uv 2 ) and 2600    ( uv 1 ) are the strongest and the most pervasive . in panel",
    "( f ) of figure [ f1 ] , the normalized flux of uv1 is compared with and/or bals .",
    "the influence of bals can be ruled out from visual examination due to the lack of detections of the commonly associated bals in these seven spectra .    for bals , hall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported one -dominant bal quasar ( sdss j221511.94 - 004549.9 ) and three possible candidates ( sdss j014905.28 - 011404.9 , j081024.75 + 480615.5 and j21441.43 - 000137.9 ) .",
    "absorption is produced by uv48 @xmath1462062.21,2068.90,2079.65 and uv34 @xmath1461895.46,1914.06,1926.30 .",
    "these four objects show unprecedented line ratios , e.g. , with stronger absorption in than , and felobals with weak or no but with strong , which is even stronger than .",
    "however , the troughs of uv34 , uv48 , and have the same blueshifted velocity and similar velocity structure .",
    "although the wavelength regime is coincidentally covered by the 2175   bump , the troughs of uv34 , uv48 are located well shortward of the peak position of the 2175   bump . at the same time",
    ", all objects reported in this paper do not show the strong broad absorption features except the known bals around 2000   ( e.g. , uv48 shown in panel ( e ) of figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the detected 2175   bumps are unlikely to be caused by the illusion of bals .",
    "in this paper , for the first time , we report the discovery of excess broad band absorption near 2250    in the spectra of seven bal quasars . these objects were selected from the sdss - iii boss dr10 quasar database using the same absorption identification method reported in jiang et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "these ebba features are detected at a high confidence level ( 4 - 5@xmath120 ) .",
    "they have broader widths at smaller wavenumbers , and their strengths are much weaker than those of the mw bumps on average , but similar to the lmc . the ebba feature may be related to the 2175   bump seen in the local group ( mw , lmc , smc ) and may be a counterpart of the 2175   bump under different conditions in the early universe . if true , they are the only candidates showing both bals and 2175  - related bumps in the same spectra .",
    "moreover , hibals are present in all of the seven quasar spectra while lobals appear in five objects .",
    "bals are the imprints of outflows driven by super - massive black holes residing in the centers of agns ( weymann et al .",
    "previous studies indicate that lobals may be early progenitors of normal agns and quasars ( e.g. , farrah et al . 2007 ; urrutia et al . 2009 ) , at the very end of an extreme starburst phase .",
    "the @xmath147 spectra of some felobals , the extreme subclass of lobals , have further shown significant signatures of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions ( farrah et al .",
    "previous statistical works indicate that about 15% of quasars show bals , and another @xmath215% of bal quasars have detected lobals ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; hewett & foltz 2003 ; reichard et al.2003 ; trump et al . 2006",
    "; gibson et al . 2009 ; zhang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "when we searched for da  in the sdss - iii / boss dr10 quasar spectra , we identified a total of 25 quasar - associated 2175   absorber candidates .",
    "therefore , about 28% of the quasar - associated da  show bals , of which 71% ( or five of seven ) show lobals .",
    "both fractions are substantially higher than those in the overall quasar sample , and the true fractions should be even higher because bal quasars are dimmed in the observed optical wavelengths by dust reddening in the da  and can be easily missed in a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "this situation suggests that there is a strong correlation between occurences of lobals and 2175   bumps .",
    "the discovery of bal quasars with 2175  - related bumps  may offer a new possibility to study the connection among the central engine , the outflow of a quasar , and the dust in the host galaxy .",
    "a probable global picture about the early evolution of quasars and their host galaxies appears from this study .",
    "the persistent processes of nucleosynthesis of the element carbon and formation of dust occur throughout the evolution of stars and galaxies , preparing the material that eventually produces the broad absorption near 2175  .",
    "dust grains with proper size and composition do not exist in all quasars .",
    "for the quasar - associated 2175    or 2175  - related bumps , the dusty materials are associated with the agn environments , probably the ism of the host galaxy , and/or the dusty envelope layer near the quasar nucleus . in the early stage of evolution ,",
    "the center of agns / quasars are encapsulated . when the central black holes are ignited , they release vast quantities of radiant energy , including high - energy ionizing photons ( rees et al .",
    "the radiation photoionizes and heats the surrounding gas , and drives strong outflows of gas and dust .",
    "( davidson & netzer 1979 ; weymann et al .",
    "when the line of sight to the continuum source intersects the outflow , bals are produced in the spectrum .",
    "outflows can efficiently shield the high - energy photons from the central engine and extend the survival period of dust .",
    "meanwhile , the energy feedback from outflows clears the surrounding space of the core ( silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; di matteo et al .",
    "accompanied by the large energy feedback , the dusty envelope layer is destroyed and cleared gradually . in this process",
    ", low - ionization ions are produced and survive in two regions , the dusty envelope layer and the core or the trailing end of outflows , because of the shielding by outflows .",
    "this appears to naturally explain the high fraction of lobals in the 2175   extinction quasars identified in this paper .",
