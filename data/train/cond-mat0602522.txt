    "it is well known that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are antagonistic phenomena ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "exchange interaction in ferromagnets results in ordering electron spins in one direction , whereas superconducting correlations in conventional superconductors lead to the formation of cooper pairs with opposite spins of electrons .",
    "the antagonistic character of ordering in ferromagnets ( f ) and in superconductors ( s ) is the reason for an essential difference between the proximity effects in s / n and s / f structures ( here n denotes a normal nonmagnetic metal ) .",
    "in s / n structures the condensate penetrates the normal metal n over a rather long distance which in the dirty limit ( @xmath2 @xmath3 is the elastic scattering time ) is equal to    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath6 is the mean free path . on the other hand ,",
    "the depth of the condensate penetration into a ferromagnet in s / f system is much shorter    @xmath7    if the exchange energy @xmath8 is larger than the temperature @xmath9 ( usually @xmath10 ) .",
    "the formula ( [ i2 ] ) is valid for a short mean free path ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "if the exchange field @xmath8 is strong enough ( @xmath12 ) , the condensate penetrates the ferromagnet over a distance of the order of @xmath13 ( if @xmath14 ) and oscillates with the period @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that a short length of the condensate penetration is related to the fact that cooper pairs in a conventional superconductor are formed by two electrons with opposite spins . in the case of a homogeneous magnetization",
    "the wave function @xmath16 of cooper pairs penetrating into the ferromagnet consists of two parts    @xmath17    the first function describes the singlet component .",
    "it differs from zero both in the whole superconducting region and in the ferromagnet over the length @xmath18 .",
    "the second function @xmath19 describes the triplet component with zero projection of the magnetic moment of a cooper pair on the @xmath20-axis ( the magnetization vector @xmath21 is oriented along the @xmath20-axis ) .",
    "it is not zero only in the vicinity of the s / f interface , over a distance @xmath22 in the superconductor and over the distance @xmath18 in the ferromagnet .",
    "this function is an odd function of the difference @xmath23 and therefore is equal to zero at @xmath24 this means that in the matsubara representation @xmath25 is an odd function of @xmath26 , whereas the function @xmath27 is an even function of @xmath26 .",
    "all the statements above concern only the case of a homogeneous magnetization in the f region .",
    "the situation changes qualitatively if the magnetization is not homogeneous , for example , if one has a spiral magnetic structure in the ferromagnet . in this case",
    "not only the singlet and triplet component with zero projection of magnetic moment , but also a triplet component with a nonzero projection of magnetic moment arises in the system .",
    "this type of the triplet component means that cooper pairs appear in the system that are described by the condensate function @xmath28 or @xmath29 the triplet pairing is well known in superfluid @xmath30 @xcite or in @xmath31 @xcite and is believed to be realized in compounds with heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "the condensate function @xmath32 in these materials is an odd function of momentum @xmath33 and an even function of the matsubara frequency @xmath34 the order parameter @xmath35 is a sum of @xmath32 over positive and negative @xmath26 and corresponds to a triplet pairing .",
    "this triplet component is suppressed by impurity scattering @xcite .    in s / f structures",
    "the impurity scattering is rather strong as ferromagnetic films used in these structures are thin ( typically the thickness of the f films @xmath36  is about 20 - 100 @xmath37 ) and the elastic scattering at least at the f surface is strong .",
    "therefore the conventional triplet component would be strongly suppressed .",
    "however there is a special type of the triplet component which can survive a strong impurity scattering .",
    "this triplet component is described by a condensate wave function @xmath32 that is even in momentum @xmath33 and odd in frequency @xmath34 this type of the condensate was first suggested by berezinskii in 1975 in attempt to describe the pairing mechanism in superfluid @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it turned out however that in reality the condensate function in @xmath30 is an even function of @xmath26 and an odd function of @xmath33 . later a possibility to realize the odd ( in frequency ) triplet superconductivity in solids",
    "was discussed for various models in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the odd in frequency @xmath26 and even in momentum @xmath33 triplet component in s / f structures differs *  * from that discussed in the preceding paragraph .",
    "it coexists with the singlet component and the order parameter @xmath35 is determined only by the ordinary ( bcs ) singlet component @xmath38 even in @xmath26 .",
    "the triplet component with nonzero projection of the magnetic moment of cooper pairs arises as the result of action of a rotating exchange field on electron spins .",
    "this type of the condensate penetrates the ferromagnet over a long distance of the order of @xmath39 ( see eq.([i1 ] ) ) provided the period of the magnetization rotation exceeds @xmath39 .",
    "a s / f structure with an inhomogeneous magnetization has been studied for the first time in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors considered a s / f structure with a bloch - type domain wall at the s / f interface in the limit of a short mean free path ( @xmath40 ) . in the domain wall of the thickness @xmath41 the magnetization vector",
    "was supposed to have the form @xmath42 where the @xmath43-axis is normal to the s / f interface . outside the domain wall",
    "the magnetization was constant : @xmath44 .",
    "the condensate function @xmath45 was found from the linearized usadel equation .",
    "it was established that this triplet component odd in frequency and even in momentum penetrates the magnetic domain wall over the length    @xmath46^{-1/2}\\ ] ]    it spreads outside the domain wall over distances of the order @xmath39 . at @xmath47 the vector of the magnetization is fixed so that the first term in eq.([i6 ] ) @xmath48 should be dropped .",
    "this triplet component may be called the long - range triplet component ( lrtc ) .",
    "the lrtc may cause a significant change in the conductance of the andreev interferometer consisting of ferromagnetic wires and a superconducting loop . as was shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", the conductance variation decreases with increasing temperature in a monotonic way .",
    "somewhat later the same problem was considered in the paper @xcite . in that publication",
    "a more complicated situation was discussed , namely , the case when the width of the domain wall is short compared to the mean free path . in order to find the condensate function ( quasiclassical green s function ) @xmath49 in this case",
    ", one needs to solve a more general eilenberger equation taking into account a non - homogeneous magnetization .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of ref.@xcite did not manage to solve the eilenberger equation and therefore restricted themselves with a rough estimation of the amplitude of @xmath49 .",
    "so , the problem of calculation of the odd triplet condensate function in the ballistic regime remained unsolved .    in the present paper",
    "we continue studying behavior of the triplet condensate considering new situations .",
    "to be specific , we study the lrtc in s / f junctions with a spiral magnetic structure in different limits including the quasi - ballistic one ( i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "this spiral structure may be both an intrinsic property of a ferromagnet ( for example , a helicoidal structure ; see @xcite ) or may just serve as a rough model for magnetic domains .",
    "we consider a system with a conical ferromagnet , that is , we assume that the magnetization in f rotates in @xmath51-plane and has a constant component along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "this type of spin structures is realized , for instance , in @xmath52 @xcite and what we discuss now is a generalization of the problem considered in @xcite , where the @xmath43-component of the magnetization in f was assumed to be zero .",
    "our study of the proximity effect in such a s / f system with a spiral magnetic structure is motivated also by the recent experiment performed on a @xmath53 structure @xcite .",
    "first , solving the usadel equation , we find the condensate function in the dirty limit .",
    "it turns out that the spatial variation of the lrtc has a nontrivial dependence on the cone angle @xmath1 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is small , the lrtc decays with @xmath43 exponentially over a distance of the order of @xmath54 , but at angles @xmath55 @xmath56 , the lrtc decays in a non - monotonic way .",
    "it oscillates with a period depending on @xmath1 .",
    "these oscillations lead to oscillations of the critical josephson current in sfs junction as a function of the thickness of the f film @xmath57 if the thickness @xmath57 is essentially greater than @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the josephson coupling is only due to the lrtc .",
    "we continue the investigation studying in the third section the lrtc in a s / f structure with a spiral structure in the limit when the condition @xmath58 is valid and the eilenberger equation must be solved .",
    "we analyze peculiarities of the lrtc in this case .",
    "surprisingly , this case has not been investigated previously , although it may correspond to a real situation . in many ferromagnets",
    "the exchange energy @xmath8 is very large so that the product @xmath59 can be arbitrary . in both sections we make an assumption that the proximity effect is weak , i.e. the amplitude of the condensate function in the ferromagnet @xmath60 is small",
    "this assumption is presumably valid in most cases because there is a strong reflection of electrons at the s / f interface due to a considerable mismatch in electronic parameters between the ferromagnet and superconductor @xcite . in conclusion",
    "we summarize the obtained results and discuss a possibility of experimental observations of the predicted behavior of the lrtc .",
    "note that in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper a bloch - type spiral structure is analyzed .",
    "the rotation axis was assumed to be perpendicular to the s / f interface so that the condensate decays in the ferromagnet in the direction parallel to this axis ( see fig.1 ) . in this case",
    "the lrtc *  * arises in the system .    at the same time",
    ", one can imagine another , neel - like type of a spiral structure with the magnetization vector @xmath61 that rotates in the plane of the ferromagnetic film and does not vary in the perpendicular direction .",
    "a solution for this type of the spiral structure has been found in ref .",
    "the authors considered the case of a thin f film and did not study the decay length in the direction normal to the film .",
    "the same problem for a thick ( infinite ) ferromagnetic film was analyzed by champel and eschrig in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "these authors assumed that the magnetization vector @xmath61 lies in the plane of the ferromagnetic film and rotates in this plane being constant in the perpendicular direction .",
    "surprisingly , they found that there was no lrtc in this case .",
    "as was shown later @xcite ,  the absence of lrtc is specific for this homogeneous spiral magnetic structure .",
    "in contrast , the long - range triplet component arises if the neel - type spiral structure is non - homogeneous ; for example , if the f film consists of magnetic domains separated by the neel walls . in this case",
    "the lrtc appears in domain walls and decays in domains over a long length of the order @xmath39 .",
    "another case where the lrtc arises is a spin - active s / f interface .",
    "such type of the interface leads to mixing singlet and triplet component and the triplet component may penetrate even into a half - metal ferromagnet when the conduction band consists of electrons with only one direction of spins @xcite .",
    "we consider a system shown schematically in fig .",
    "a ferromagnetic film f is attached to a superconductor s. the magnetization @xmath61 in the ferromagnet is assumed to rotate in space and the vector @xmath21 has the form        @xmath62    this form of the magnetization vector implies that the projection of the @xmath63 vector onto the @xmath43-axis @xmath64 is constant and the projection onto the @xmath51-plane @xmath65 rotates in space with the wave vector @xmath66 .",
    "we also assume that the condition    @xmath67    is fulfilled , that is , either the exchange energy @xmath8 is not large or the collision frequency @xmath68 is high enough .",
    "in addition , we assume that the proximity effect is weak , i.e. ,  the condensate function @xmath60 is small .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath60 function means the presence of a barrier at the s / f interface or a big mismatch in electronic parameters of the superconductor and ferromagnet ( the fermi momenta in f and s differ greatly ) . in this case",

    "the pauli matrices @xmath77 and @xmath78 operate in the particle - hole and spin space , respectively .",
    "the green function in the bulk of the superconductor is    @xmath79    with @xmath80 .",
    "this function describes an ordinary singlet condensate in conventional superconductors . assuming this solution to be valid up to the interface",
