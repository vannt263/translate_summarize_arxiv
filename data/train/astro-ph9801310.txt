    "the development of the unified model for seyfert galaxies has opened interesting questions regarding the nature of the optical  uv continuum in seyfert 2s .",
    "this continuum seems to be well understood only in the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 ( antonucci & miller 1985 , miller , goodrich & mathews 1991 ) , where it is attributed to a combination of a red stellar population contribution plus a blue featureless continuum scattered towards us by electrons , and in mrk477 ( heckman et al .",
    "1997 ) , where the observed blue continuum is dominated by a dusty starburst .",
    "polarimetric studies by miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) , and later by tran , miller & kay ( 1992 ) , kay ( 1994 ) and tran ( 1995a , b , c ) have revealed polarized lines and continua in a number of additional seyfert 2 s , indicating the presence of a scattered seyfert 1 component . however , the low levels of polarization ( miller & goodrich 1990 ) , lack of detectable broad lines in the direct spectra ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 , heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) , and larger polarizations in the broad lines than in the continuum ( tran 1995a , b , c ) indicate the existence of another source of continuum , not accounted for by the starlight template nor by the reflected nuclear component .",
    "the origin of `` fc2 '' , as this extra component became known ( miller 1994 , tran 1995c ) is one of the most important current issues in seyfert 2s studies . the two currently contending scenarios are free - free emission from the scattering region ( tran 1995c ) , and young - stars , as advocated by cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) and heckman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "when discussing the nature of the optical continuum in active galaxies , one must be aware of the importance of evaluating and removing the starlight `` contamination '' , particularly in seyfert 2s , where the stellar component often overwhelms the scattered flux .",
    "indeed , as emphasized by miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) , antonucci ( 1993 ) , kay ( 1994 ) and tran ( 1995a ) , the derived polarizations are very sensitive to the adopted stellar population template . the simple fact that different authors obtain very different starlight fractions for the same object ( e.g. , kay 1994 , tran 1995a ) is a clear demonstration of how critical and uncertain is the starlight removal procedure . in most polarimetric studies , as in fact in most optical spectroscopy studies of agn since koski ( 1978 ) , the stellar population template used to subtract the stellar contribution is the nuclear spectrum of an elliptical or early type galaxy . given a library of normal galaxy spectra spanning a sufficiently wide range of stellar population mixtures , this approach will certainly produce a satisfactorily agn - looking , smooth residual spectrum .",
    "however , given the non - uniqueness of the solution , one must always bear in mind that the adopted template may not correspond to the true stellar population of the host galaxy . and",
    "even if the adopted template accounts for , say , 80% of the true stellar component , the error induced by not accounting for the remaining 20% may be critical when it comes to interpreting the nature of the residual continuum .    in order to investigate the stellar populations in active galaxies using a different approach ,",
    "we ( cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann & schmitt 1997 , hereafter paper i ) have recently concluded a study where we have used long - slit optical spectroscopy of 42 galaxies to measure the variation of equivalent widths ( hereafter w ) of several stellar absorption lines , as well as continuum ratios as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "our goals were to map the stellar populations in the sample galaxies , and to obtain the stellar population characteristics right at the active nucleus via extrapolation of the properties measured in neighboring extranuclear regions .",
    "such an approach has been previously used by fosbury et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and by ourselves in previous works ( e.g. schmitt , storchi - bergmann & baldwin 1994 ; storchi - bergmann et al . 1995 , 1997a ) .",
    "in paper i we found that the presence of a featureless continuum in the nucleus of seyfert 1 galaxies was revealed by a bluening of the continuum and by a decrease of the w s of the absorption lines towards the nucleus . in galaxies with nuclear starbursts or rings of star formation",
    ", the same behavior was observed : the star - forming regions present bluer colors and smaller w s .",
    "one unexpected result was the finding that , in the majority of seyfert 2 galaxies , there is neither a dilution of the w s nor a bluening of the continuum towards the nucleus , indicating that the featureless continuum , if present at the nucleus , contributes with less than @xmath210% of the flux in the optical waveband .",
    "the only clear cases of detection of dilutions and blue continua were the seyfert 2 galaxies already known to harbor `` composite nuclei '' , with both seyfert and starburst activity , as evidenced by the emission - line ratios and/or the presence of absorption features of young stars .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure 1 , where we show the variation of w(ca ii k ) , w(g band ) , w(mg i@xmath3mgh ) and of the continuum ratio @xmath45870/@xmath44020 as a function of distance from the nuclei for the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc6814 , for the galaxy with composite nucleus ( seyfert 2 and starburst ) ngc7130 and the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk348 . while the decrease of the w s and bluening of the continuum is obvious in the two former galaxies ,",
    "they are not observed in the latter .    in this paper , we investigate the above results more closely for four seyfert 2 galaxies : mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 , as previous works have reported dilution factors up to @xmath550% for these galaxies . in paper",
    "i we have shown that our method allows the detection of dilutions larger than 510% ( which correspond to the uncertainties in the w s ) , but for these galaxies we have not detected significant dilutions in the absorption features of the stellar population up to at least @xmath5 10  from the nucleus . this behavior can be observed in fig . 1 for mrk348 and in similar plots for mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 ( figs",
    ". 17 , 21 and 25 from paper i ) .",
    "we investigate the reason for this lack of dilution and the implications for the nature of the nuclear continuum and stellar population .",
    "the data discussed here have been described in paper i. in summary , they consist of long - slit spectra obtained with the cassegrain spectrograph and reticon detector at the 4 m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "the pixel size was @xmath2 1  and the slit width 2 .",
    "for the four galaxies discussed here , the observations were obtained under photometric conditions with a seeing of @xmath2 1 .",
    "the slit was oriented along the radio axis and/or along the extended emission , but the observations were scheduled to make this angle coincide with the paralactic angle , in order to avoid the effects of differential refraction .",
    "the spectral resolution ( fwhm of the calibration lamp lines ) is @xmath2 7 .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "the spectra were reduced and flux calibrated using standard procedures in iraf , and one - dimensional spectra were extracted along the spatial direction in windows of 2@xmath62 . prior to the analysis , the spectra were corrected for the foreground milky way reddening , using the empirical selective extinction function of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the corresponding e(b - v ) values are listed in the last column of table 1 and were extracted from the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 are nearby galaxies , whose bulges have effective radii ranging from 6  to 36 , as determined by near - infrared surface photometry ( alonso - herrero , ward & kotilainen , 1996 ; heisler , de robertis & nadeau 1996 ; xanthopoulos 1996 ) . thus , the bulge is completely resolved in these galaxies , and spectra extracted at less than 6   from the nucleus will still be sampling the bulge stellar population .",
    "we believe that using a stellar population template from the bulge of the same galaxy to represent the stellar population of the nucleus is in principle a more robust approach than adopting a population template from other galaxies , as paper i shows that the stellar population varies substantially from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the smooth radial variation of the w s of absorption lines found in paper i , also supports this approach .",
    "the w s only show abrupt changes when there is evidence of the presence of a blue stellar population in the starburst galaxies or in the rings of star formation or a featureless continuum  in the seyfert 1 galaxies .    moreover ,",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , previous works usually adopt an elliptical galaxy template to represent the stellar population in seyfert nuclei , whereas recent studies ( wyse , gilmore & franx 1997 ) show that stellar populations in bulges frequently differ from that in ellipticals .",
    "jablonka , martin & arimoto ( 1996 ) show that bulges occupy regions similar to that of ellipticals in the fundamental plane , but are displaced towards smaller line strengths .",
    "balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) showed that , although bulges follow a color - magnitude relationship similar to that of ellipticals , they have a larger scatter and are bluer than ellipticals of similar luminosity .",
    "the use of an elliptical galaxy template to subtract the stellar population contribution of the bulge of an spiral or lenticular galaxy is thus likely to produce a residual blue continuum due to a `` template mismatch '' ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1992 ) .    these facts , together with the discrepant results obtained by different authors using the traditional elliptical galaxy template method , motivated us to seek for an alternative starlight evaluation technique . in this section",
    "we compare the bulge extranuclear spectra with the nuclear spectra of mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 , in order to investigate if the former can be used as stellar population templates for the latter .",
    "two criteria were used to select the windows for the extranuclear spectra : ( 1 ) to keep the smallest possible angular distance from the nucleus  always smaller than the effective radius of the bulge  in order to minimize changes in the stellar population characteristics ; ( 2 ) to ensure that the distance was large enough to avoid contamination from nuclear light due to seeing effects .",
    "the nuclear and extranuclear windows all have sizes of 2@xmath62 .",
    "in order to construct the extranuclear spectra , we have skipped the windows adjacent to the nucleus and averaged the two extractions centered at 4  at both sides of the nucleus , which include light from 3  to 5  from the nucleus .",
    "as the seeing was @xmath21  in the observations , we do not expect significant contamination by nuclear light at these windows .",
    "the corresponding average distances from the nuclei at the galaxies are 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.0 and 1.0 kpc , respectively for mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 .",
    "we compare the nuclear with the extranuclear optical ( 3500 to 6000 ) spectrum of each galaxy in figs .",
    "2 to 5 . as all galaxies present extended emission",
    ", we have chopped the emission lines from the extranuclear spectra in order to allow a more clear comparison of the absorption features .",
    "an extranuclear spectrum is considered to be an acceptable fit to the nuclear one if the nuclear w s are reproduced within 10% and the continuum within 5% . at the blue end of the spectra ,",
    "somewhat larger differences in the continua were allowed ( @xmath210% ) due to the larger noise in this spectral region .",
    "these values correspond to the maximum uncertainties in the measurements of w s and continua in paper i. the residuals in the continuum were calculated as averages of the difference spectra ( nuclear@xmath7extranuclear ) , in windows avoiding emission lines .",
    "the difference spectra are also shown in figs .",
    "25 .    in all cases ,",
    "the nuclear continuum is slightly redder than the extranuclear one ( see paper i ) .",
    "assuming that this is due to an excess reddening of the nuclear relative to the extranuclear spectra ( in agreement with the accepted scenario that the nuclear regions in seyfert 2 galaxies are dusty ) , we have reddened the extranuclear spectra by the necessary amount to make the continuum slopes to match that of the nuclear spectra .",
    "we now discuss the results for each galaxy .",
    "figure 2a shows the comparison of the nuclear with the reddened [ e(b - v)=0.03 ] extranuclear spectrum of mrk348 , after normalization of the latter to the flux of the nuclear spectrum near 5500 , as well as the residual between the two .",
    "the nuclear continuum is well reproduced ( within 5% ) by the extranuclear one after a small reddening of the latter , and , in paper i , we have also concluded that the equivalent widths of absorption lines are the same within the uncertainties ( @xmath810% ) .",
    "these results indicate that the nuclear stellar population can be reproduced by that of the extranuclear spectrum ; no extra spectral component seems to be needed within the margins of our matching criteria .",
    "we now compare our results with those obtained by tran  ( 1995a , b , c ) .",
    "tran has shown that mrk348 presents a seyfert 1 spectrum in polarized light , with a continuum polarization of 5.7% ( after starlight correction ) , increasing to more than twice this value in broad h@xmath9 .",
    "the stellar component , represented by the elliptical galaxy ngc 821 , was found to contribute 73% of the total flux at @xmath45500 , while our results suggest a much larger fraction .",
    "tran s analysis of the spectropolarimetry data also showed that fc1 ( the scattered seyfert 1 component in tran s nomenclature ) , amounts to 5% of the flux at @xmath45500 , and that it has a @xmath10  shape .",
    "unlike the starlight fraction , the fc1 strength is not strongly dependent on the choice of template , since tran s determination takes into account the strength necessary to match the polarization of the continuum to that of the broad lines .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11  shape is not critically affected by the template , as it is implicit in the polarized spectrum ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "since we know that a scattered component is present , the spectral decomposition in fig .",
    "2a is not physically acceptable , as it corresponds to 100% starlight . yet , as shown below , there is room for a small contribution from the scattered component .    adopting a f@xmath13  shape for the reflected continuum , a contribution of 5% at @xmath45500  corresponds to a decrease of @xmath25% of w(mgi+mgh ) , somewhat larger for w(g band ) , and up to @xmath210% for w(caii k ) , thus within our measurement uncertainties for the w s . in order to illustrate that both w s and continuum shape are in agreement with the presence of such a scattered nuclear continuum",
    ", we have combined the extranuclear spectrum with a f@xmath13  power - law in proportions of 95% and 5% at @xmath45500 , respectively , and compared this spectrum with the nuclear one .",
    "the best reproduction of the nuclear spectrum was obtained when , prior to the combination with the power - law component , we reddened the extranuclear spectrum by an additional e(b - v)=0.06",
    ". the result is shown in figure 2b .",
    "the essential difference between tran s results and ours is that , while he attributes the remaining 22% of the photons at 5500   to an extra continuum source ( fc2 ) , we account for the whole spectrum with either just the extranuclear stellar population template ( fig .",
    "2a ) or , more realistically , with a combination of this template plus the reflected nuclear spectrum ( fig .",
    "we remark that the slit width used in our observations ( 2 ) , is similar to that used by tran ( 2.4 ) , and the same used by kay ( 1994 ) .",
    "the 2  length of our nuclear extraction window was smaller that the typical 57  used by kay , while tran does not give this information , but it is unlikely that it is smaller than ours .",
    "we thus rule out the possibility that we have found a larger galaxy contribution due to a larger nuclear window . instead , the different starlight fractions found by tran and us stem from the different stellar population templates used .",
    "note that tran s galaxy fractions are already larger than the ones obtained by miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) for the objects in common , including mrk348 and mrk1210 .",
    "our results show that an even larger stellar contribution is possible .",
    "figure 3a shows the comparison of the nuclear spectrum of mrk573 with the reddened [ e(b - v)=0.1 ] extranuclear spectrum . in this case",
    ", we find some mismatch of the continuum between 4000 and 5000 , the reddened extranuclear spectrum having @xmath1410% less flux than the nuclear spectrum in this spectral region .",
    "mrk573 has a polarized continuum observed by kay  ( 1994 ) . allowing for a few percent contribution of such component ( represented by a f@xmath15  power - law , in analogy with mrk348 ) , we get an even worse fit in the @xmath164000 - 5000  region .    we have then tried a different stellar population template , obtained from the nuclear spectrum of the elliptical galaxy ic4889 , from our sample of paper i ( thus , observed with the same setup as mrk573 ) , combined with the same power - law component above .",
    "figure 3b shows that this template , combined with a 10% contribution of the power - law at @xmath45500 gives a better fit for the continuum , and at the same time reproduces the nuclear w values .",
    "this result is in approximate agreement with previous studies , like that of kay ( 1994 ) , who derived a stellar population contribution of 80% at @xmath44400 , while our results imply a stellar population contribution of 85% at this wavelength .    but how to understand the lack of dilution of the w s in the nucleus of this galaxy ?",
    "one possibility is that the stellar population shows a small variation with distance from the nucleus , more evident in the shape of the continuum than in the absorption lines , and that the scattered ( power - law ) component is _ extended _ , keeping the w s approximately at the same values .",
    "an extended blue continuum , probably due to scattered light , has indeed been found in near - uv images of mrk573 by pogge & de robertis ( 1993 ) along the ionization cones observed in this galaxy .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , spatially resolved spectropolarimetry should reveal a seyfert 1 spectrum up to a few arcseconds from the nucleus along the cone axis .",
    "figure 4a shows the comparison of the nuclear spectrum of ngc1358 with the reddened [ e(b - v)=0.1 ] extranuclear spectrum .",
    "the two spectra present @xmath175% differences in the continuum and @xmath18% differences in the w s , suggesting no contribution by a featureless continuum .",
    "nevertheless , kay ( 1994 ) finds a continuum polarization of 1.65% ( after starlight subtraction ) , indicating the presence of a scattered component , albeit weak .",
    "she derives a stellar population contribution of 83% at @xmath19 , while our results indicate a larger contribution , of at least 90% at the ca ii k line .",
    "allowing for a contribution of up to 10% of a f@xmath20  component in the blue , at @xmath45500 this contribution amounts only to @xmath23% .",
    "the fit we obtain for the nuclear spectrum , combining 3% of this component with 97% of extranuclear spectrum at @xmath45500  is slightly improved , as illustrated in figure 4b . at @xmath44400",
    "the stellar population contribution amounts to @xmath295% .",
    "we note that the 83% starlight fraction found by kay yields an uncomfortably low polarization for ngc 1358 as compared to the typical values expected in the unified model ( miller & goodrich 1990 ) . only for fractions above 95% , and thus within the range of the acceptable stellar population contributions according to our method , would the polarization raise above 10% .",
    "5a shows a comparison of the nuclear spectrum of mrk1210 with the extranuclear one scaled and reddened by e(b - v)=0.07 .",
    "the latter is a good reproduction of the nuclear spectrum down to the ca ii k line , with differences in the continuum @xmath175% and @xmath1710% in the w s . but bellow 3900 , there is an excess continuum in the nuclear spectrum .",
    "this continuum could be due to the balmer recombination continuum of the emitting gas , which is significant in this galaxy because of its strong emission lines .",
    "the gaseous temperature , as derived from the [ oiii]@xmath44363/5007 emission - line ratio is about 20,000k . we have then used the corresponding h@xmath21 recombination coefficient and hi continuum emission coefficient from osterbrock ( 1989 ) , and the observed h@xmath21  flux ( 5.38@xmath610@xmath22 ergs @xmath23 s@xmath24 ) to derive the contribution of the balmer continuum to the nuclear spectrum .",
    "this contribution amounts to @xmath23% of the total flux at @xmath45500 , @xmath27% at @xmath43700 and 30% for @xmath253646 .",
    "we note that a balmer continuum has also been detected in mrk477 ( heckman et .",
    "1997 , hereafter h97 ) , a galaxy in many respects similar to mrk1210 ( see below ) .",
    "mrk1210 was also observed by tran ( 1995a , b , c ) , who found a polarized continuum contribution of 6% at @xmath45500 . as for mrk348",
    ", this value is derived by tran as being the one necessary to make the polarization in the continuum to agree with that of the broad lines .",
    "tran finds a 75% stellar contribution , while the remaining 19% `` non - stellar '' continuum is attributed to fc2 .",
    "the spectral distribution of the scattered continuum is derived to be f@xmath26 .",
    "we have then combined this power - law contribution normalized to 6% at @xmath45500 , the balmer continuum described above ( 3% at @xmath45500 ) and the extranuclear spectrum normalized to 91% of the nuclear flux at @xmath45500  after applying an additional reddening of e(b - v)=0.08 .",
    "the result is the spectral distribution illustrated in fig .",
    "5b , which is an improved fit to the nuclear spectrum .",
    "again , the different stellar fractions obtained by us and previous works result from the different stellar population templates . as for mrk348",
    ", what tran ( 1995c ) calls fc2 is somehow included in our stellar population template",
    ". a close look at the nuclear emission - line spectrum shows that this galaxy seems to present a `` wolf - rayet feature '' , which can be observed in fig .",
    "we point out the similarity of the whole complex to that found in mrk477 by h97 .",
    "we identify 5 narrow emission - lines in this complex : [ feiii]@xmath44658 , heii@xmath44686 , [ ariv]@xmath164711,4740  and [ neiv]@xmath44725 , to which we have fitted narrow gaussians , constraining their fwhm to the average value of the other strong emission lines in the spectrum ( 720 km s@xmath24 ) .",
    "the subtraction of these lines leaves the residual shown in figure 6b , centered around @xmath44670 , with flux 1.22@xmath27 erg @xmath23 s@xmath24 ( and luminosity @xmath28 erg s@xmath24 ) .    following the methodology of h97",
    "we have compared our spectrum with those from wr stars ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ; conti & massey 1989 ) , in order to estimate the type of wr stars producing the emission lines .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion : that the residual of fig",
    ". 6b can be identified as broad emission from heii@xmath44686  and niii@xmath44640 , and the wr stars in mrk1210 can be classified as of subtype wn6 - 7 or later .    in a starburst , the ratio of the flux of the wolf - rayet complex to the h@xmath21 flux gives a measure of the relative importance of wr and o stars ( h97 and references therein ) .",
    "in mrk1210 , this value is @xmath220% , which is a lower limit , as the h@xmath21  flux includes contribution from ionization by the agn .",
    "this value is twice the value found for mrk477 ( h97 ) before correcting for the contribution from the agn , and indicates the presence at the nucleus of mrk1210 of a stellar burst with an age between 3 and 8 myr ( h97 , meynet 1995 ) .",
    "since we have concluded that the difference between the starlight fractions obtained here with respect to those in previous works ( particularly for mrk 348 and mrk 1210 ) is due to the different stellar population templates , it is natural to ask what do our templates have that ordinary elliptical galaxies do nt ?    in order to answer this question , we have performed a population synthesis analysis using the base of stellar clusters of bica ( 1988 ) and the method described in schmitt , bica & pastoriza ( 1996 ) . as input data we have used the w s of ca ii k , cn , g - band and mg i + mgh absorption features , as well as the continuum fluxes at 3660 , 4020 , 4570 and 6630 , all normalized to the flux at 5870 .",
    "the results of the synthesis are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the stellar population of mrk573 is represented by the elliptical template from ic4889 , in the last line of the table , while for the other galaxies the results correspond to the extranuclear templates discussed in  3 .",
    "the columns of the table show the percentage contribution of the age bins corresponding to 10 gyr ( globular clusters ) , 1 gyr , 100 myr , 10 myr and hii regions , respectively , to the spectrum at @xmath45870 . we also list , between parentheses , the corresponding fractions at @xmath44510 .    inspection of the table shows that in ngc1358 , as in the case of the elliptical galaxy template , the population is composed almost only by the 10 gyr and 1 gyr age bins . in mrk348 and mrk1210 , however , there are additional contributions from the younger age bins ( @xmath8100 myr ) , amounting to 10% and 23% , respectively . since these populations are blue , the corresponding fractions increase for shorter wavelengths , reaching 14% and 33% at 4510  respectively ( table 2 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the difference between our extranuclear templates and the more commonly used elliptical galaxy spectrum is the presence of a substantial contribution from a 0100 myr old population .",
    "a combination of a red bulge , power - law continuum , young and intermediate age components has been also found in previous works on the analysis of the optical continuum of active galaxies .",
    "tadhunter , dickinson & shaw ( 1996 ) , for example , have concluded that an intermediate age component was required in order to reproduce the optical spectrum of the nearby radio galaxy 3c321 , in addition to a power - law and an old bulge component . using a similar method as used here , storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have also found a mixture of old bulge , power - law and `` aging starburst '' components in the continuum spectrum of the inner region of cen a. cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1992 ) have also suggested that the contribution from young and intermediate age stars in seyfert 2s may have been sistematically underestimated due to a `` template mismatch '' effect .",
    "such a mismatch results from the known difficulty in determining the contribution of early type stars to the optical spectrum of agn ( see discussions in miller & goodrich 1990 and kay 1994 ) .",
    "further studies suggesting the presence of young to intermediate age stars in active galaxies are the ones about the strength of the ca ii triplet around 8500   ( terlevich , diaz & terlevich 1990 ) , and the infrared work of oliva et al .",
    "had we used an elliptical galaxy as a template for mrk348 and mrk1210 , we would inevitably obtain larger featureless continuum ( fc ) contributions .",
    "experiments using the nuclear spectrum of the elliptical galaxy ic 4889 confirm this ( see figures 7 and 8) . in order to match the nuclear spectrum of mrk 348 , a combination of 85% contribution of the elliptical template ic4889 and a 15% @xmath11 power - law contribution at @xmath45500  would be required . for mrk 1210",
    ", the proportions would be 69% of starlight and 28% of a @xmath29  power - law ( plus 3% contribution of the balmer continuum ) , in better agreement with tran s ( 1995a ) results .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the fits obtained with an elliptical galaxy are as good as those obtained with the extranuclear templates ! however , these are by no means equivalent choices , since the differences in the starlight fractions imply completely different scenarios for the nature of the residual non - stellar continuum . which leaves us with the question : how is one to decide which template to use ?",
    "whilst it is not possible to decide _ a priori _ which template suits best the true stellar population in the nucleus , we believe that a spectrum extracted from the bulge of the same galaxy , should be , in most cases , a better representation of the nuclear stellar population than a spectrum from an external galaxy , whose star formation history may differ substantially from that of the target galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the much higher fc fractions obtained above with the elliptical galaxy template would imply w and color radial gradients , if the fc is concentrated in or close to the nucleus , which should be detectable with our method , whereas we find none ( paper i ) .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1 shows that the w(ca ii k ) of ngc6814 decreases by @xmath240% at the nucleus due to the fc . in the case of mrk348 , for the 15% fc contribution at @xmath45500",
    "derived above with the nuclear stellar population represented by the elliptical galaxy template , the fc contribution at the ca ii k line is 33% , while for mrk1210 the 28% contribution at @xmath45500   corresponds to 45% at the ca ii k line .",
    "such dilutions are comparable to that observed in ngc6814 and should thus be readily observed .    the only possibility to have an elliptical galaxy template plus a fc at the nucleus and no radial dilution of the absorption lines is if the fc is _ extended _ and the fc to galaxy ratio remains constant throughout the inner regions . in this case",
    "our extranuclear spectra would not correspond to the pure stellar population component , since they would be contaminated by the fc ( be it fc1 , fc2 or both ) . testing",
    "this possibility will require further observational constraints .",
    "direct imaging in the uv could in principle reveal an extended continuum , as was observed in mrk573 ( pogge & de robertis 1993 ) .",
    "polarization maps would allow to test the presence of extended scattered light , as well as long - slit spectra obtained at several position angles .",
    "regardeless of its extension , the fc in mrk348 and mrk1210 is clearly dominated not by scattered light , but by fc2 .",
    "tran ( 1995c ) finds that 83% of the fc is due to fc2 in mrk348 and 76% in mrk1210 .",
    "the difference between the extranuclear templates of mrk348 and 1210 and an elliptical galaxy should thus be essentially due to fc2 . according to the synthesis results , this difference is due to young and intermediate age stars , which we therefore associate with fc2 .",
    "a conclusive detection of features from such stars would corroborate this idea .",
    "the wr feature in mrk1210 confirms the presence of young stars .",
    "uv spectroscopy could provide further evidence of this through the detection of siiv and civ absorptions , as found in mrk477 ( h97 ) . in the case of mrk348",
    "the evidence for young to intermediate age stars relies not on a direct detection , but on our population synthesis analysis .",
    "uv spectroscopy of this object will be crucial to test this result .",
    "uv spectropolarimetry would also be useful to test the contribution of young to intermediate age stars .",
    "while the older stellar components should contribute little to the uv emission , the young stars should extend into the uv range along with the scattered agn component .",
    "since the stellar flux is presumably unpolarized , we expect that mrk1210 ( and possibly mrk348 ) presents broad uv lines ( e.g. civ@xmath41550 and mgii@xmath42800 ) with a _ larger polarization _ than the adjacent continuum .",
    "in other words , the `` dilution by fc2 effect '' found by tran ( 1995c ) should extend into the uv .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the optical continuum and stellar population in the nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxies mrk348 , mrk573 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 using long - slit spectroscopic data .    in a previous work ( paper i ) we have found that none of these galaxies present dilutions in the nuclear equivalent widths w s of the absorption lines as compared with those of the extranuclear spectra from the bulge of the same galaxy , as it would be expected if a featureless continuum was present at the nuclei in the proportions found in previous works ( 20%50% ) .",
    "we have tested one possibility to account for this lack of dilution : that the nuclear stellar population is the same as the extranuclear one from the bulge , and the featureless continuum contribution to the nuclear spectra is smaller than 10% ( and thus not producing enough dilution in the w s to be detectable with our method ) .",
    "we conclude that this hypothesis works for mrk348 , ngc1358 and mrk1210 .",
    "a larger stellar population contribution can solve several puzzles of seyfert 2 galaxies : ( 1 ) it raises the level of intrinsic polarization , bringing it closer to the values expected in the unified model ( miller & goodrich 1990 ) ; ( 2 ) it avoids the problem of overpredicting the strengths of broad lines in the direct spectra ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1992 , 1995 , heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) ; and ( 3 ) it allows a compatibilization of the polarizations measured for the broad lines and continua .",
    "this last point is implicit in our results , since we have shown that , for mrk 348 and mrk 1210 , the nuclear spectrum can be adequately fit with a stellar component plus the scattered continuum at the strengths inferred from spectropolarimetry ( tran 1995a , b , c ) . since these are exactly the problems which lead to the idea of a second featureless continuum component ( miller 1994 ) , our results suggest that fc2 is the result of an underestimation of the stellar contribution .",
    "our population synthesis analysis indicates that the larger stellar population contribution found for mrk348 and mrk1210 relative to that found in previous works is due to the presence of young and intermediate age stars ( @xmath30  myr ) , not accounted for by the more commonly used elliptical galaxy templates . in other words , the fc2 would be due to blue stars in these two cases . for mrk1210",
    ", the apparent detection of a `` wolf - rayet '' feature confirms this result .",
    "these findings , together with results from the recent study by h97 on mrk477 , suggest that young populations may be common in markarian seyferts , being responsible for at least part of the blue continuum in these galaxies ( which were discovered precisely due to their blue continuum ) .",
    "the above results suggest that star - formation is an important piece in the agn puzzle .",
    "we speculate that , if there is a causal link between star - formation and activity , the @xmath31  myr star formation time scale identified in this paper should be comparable to the duration of the nuclear activity cycle . since 100 myr is about 1% of the hubble time , a causal link between star formation and activity would imply that about 1% of the galaxies should be active .",
    "interestingly , this value seems to agree with current estimates ( e.g. huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "population synthesis for a complete sample of nearby seyferts could help putting tighter constraints on this link .",
    "we have also tested an elliptical galaxy template , as used in previous works . for mrk573",
    ", this template gives a better match to the nuclear stellar population than the extranuclear spectrum .",
    "the lack of dilution in this case could be due to the presence of an extended scattered continuum ( observed in uv images by pogge & de robertis , 1993 ) .",
    "mrk348 and mrk1210 also present an excess blue continuum when compared with an elliptical template .",
    "according to our w s measurements , this continuum should be extended , but according to the spectropolarimetry by tran ( 1995c ) , only a small part of it is polarized , so it is unlikely that it is dominated by scattered light .",
    "this result is thus consistent with our finding of an excess blue population in these galaxies relative to an elliptical galaxy .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that , as all current fc2 indicators are critically dependent on the starlight correction procedure , unveiling the nature of fc2 will necessarily require a carefull examination of the stellar population in the central regions of agn . with this goal , in a forthcoming paper ( schmitt et al .",
    "1998 ) , we investigate the stellar content of a sample of 42 active and normal galaxies , via population synthesis as a function of distance from the nuclei , using the extensive data of paper i.    we acknowledge fruitful discussions with laura kay , andrew s. wilson and roberto terlevich , and valuable suggestions by an anonymous referee .",
