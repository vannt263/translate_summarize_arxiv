    "amorphous semiconductor materials like chalcogenide glasses present a great potential for application in technological devices , such as optical fibers , memory materials and switching devices , but their use is limited due to several factors .",
    "one of them is the difficulty in obtaining information about atomic structures , which define the short - range order ( sro ) of the alloy . in this context , the structures of amorphous ge@xmath8se@xmath9 ( _ a_-ge@xmath8se@xmath9 ) and liquid ge@xmath8se@xmath9 ( _ l_-ge@xmath8se@xmath9 ) , in particular ge@xmath10se@xmath11 ( gese@xmath12 ) , have been extensively studied by several experimental techniques , like neutron diffraction ( nd ) @xcite , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) @xcite , extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) @xcite and raman spectroscopy ( rs ) @xcite . on the theoretical side , molecular dynamics simulations ( md ) @xcite and reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulations",
    "@xcite have been carried out to understand the sro in these liquids and glasses in terms of two possible and distinct models . in the first one the distribution of bonds in the structure",
    "is purely randomic and determined by the local coordination numbers and composition . in the second one , there is a strong sro and the structure is formed by well defined structural units , e.g. , corner - sharing gese@xmath13 ( cs ) tetrahedral and edge - sharing ge@xmath12se@xmath14 ( es ) bitetrahedral units .",
    "the distribution of these units gives raise to a medium , or intermediate , range order ( iro ) , whose signature is the appearance of a first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) in the neutron @xcite or x - ray structure factors @xcite at many compositions . in particular , nd experiments performed on melt - quenched @xcite ( mq ) gese@xmath12 ( mq - gese@xmath12 ) showed a fsdp in the total structure factor @xmath15 which was associated with correlations in the range of 56   .",
    "as described in ref .  , this alloy is formed by cs and es units with heteropolar bonds but there are homopolar bonds in very small quantities",
    ". it should be noted , however , that almost all available data about _ a_-ge@xmath8se@xmath9 alloys were determined for mq samples , and the preparation method can affect the sro and iro .",
    "we have recently verified this assumption in a study about the structure of _",
    "@xcite produced by mechanical alloying ( ma ) @xcite . in our case , an unexpected large number of se - se pairs is found in the first coordination shell , suggesting that the tetrahedral units are linked by se - se  bridges \" .",
    "et al_. @xcite , by comparing the structures of _ a_-ge@xmath16se@xmath17 produced by mq and by vacuum evaporation ( ve ) techniques , and tani _",
    "et al_. @xcite studying the _ a_-gese@xmath12 produced by mechanical grinding ( mg ) of its crystalline counterpart have also found some structural differences among alloys produced by different methods .",
    "these differences are important because some physicochemical properties can be altered and improved as desired by choosing an appropriate preparation method .    in this paper , we investigated the sro and iro of an amorphous gese@xmath0 alloy produced by ma ( ma-_a_-gese@xmath0 ) starting from the elemental powders of ge and se using raman spectroscopy ( rs ) , x - ray diffraction and reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulations @xcite of its xrd @xmath15 .",
    "we were interested in studying two main points .",
    "first of all we would like to know if the alloy produced by ma contains cs or es units .",
    "besides that , even if these units are formed the sro and the iro of the alloy can be significantly altered by the high quantity of defects and disorder introduced by the ma process when compared to mq samples , for instance .",
    "therefore , the second point is to determine the local structure of the alloy itself , finding coordination numbers and interatomic distances . at our knowledge , this is the first time that such study is reported concerning an _ a_-gese@xmath0 alloy produced by ma .",

    "thus , the atomic configuration corresponding to equilibrium should be consistent with the experimental total structure factor within the experimental error . by using the @xmath45 functions",
    "the coordination numbers and interatomic distances can be calculated .",
    "in addition , the bond - angle distributions @xmath53 can also be determined .",
    "the ma-_a_-gese@xmath0 alloy was produced by considering a binary mixture of high - purity elemental powders of germanium ( alfa aesar 99.999% purity , particle size @xmath54 150 @xmath55 m ) and selenium ( alfa aesar 99.999% purity , particle size @xmath54 150 @xmath55 m ) that was sealed together with several steel balls into a cylindrical steel vial under an argon atmosphere .",
    "the ball - to - powder weight ratio was 5:1 .",
    "a spex mixer / mill model 8000 was used to perform ma at room temperature .",
    "the mixture was continuously milled for 50 h. a ventilation system was used to keep the vial temperature close to room temperature .",
    "the xrd pattern was recorded in a powder siemens diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator , using the cuk@xmath56 line ( @xmath57  ) .",
    "the total structure factor @xmath15 was computed from the xrd pattern after corrections for polarization , absorption , and inelastic scattering , following the procedure described by wagner @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 values were taken from a table compiled by sasaki @xcite .",
    "raman measurements were performed with a t64000 jobin - yvon triple monochromator coupled to a cooled ccd detector and a conventional photon counting system .",
    "the 5145    line of an argon ion laser was used as exciting light , always in backscattering geometry .",
    "the output power of the laser was kept at about 200 mw to avoid overheating the samples .",
