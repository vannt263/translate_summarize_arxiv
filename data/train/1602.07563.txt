    "sentiment analysis is a form of shallow semantic analysis of texts .",
    "its goal is to extract opinions , emotions or attitudes towards different objects of interest @xcite .",
    "for example , one might be interested in consumers opinion about products , voters attitude towards political parties , or investors expectations about stocks . from the first approaches in 2000s ,",
    "sentiment analysis gained considerable attention with massive growth of the web and social media .",
    "different forms of textual information are becoming easily accessible ( e.g. , news , blogs , reviews , facebook comments , twitter posts , etc . ) , and different approaches to sentiment analysis were developed .",
    "there are two prevailing approaches to large - scale sentiment analysis : ( i ) lexicon - based and ( ii ) machine learning . in the first case ,",
    "the sentiment in the text is computed from the set of sentiment - bearing words identified in the text . in the second case ,",
    "a sentiment classification model is constructed first , from a large set of sentiment labeled texts , and then applied to the stream of unlabelled texts .",
    "the model has the form of a function that maps features extracted from the text into sentiment labels ( which typically have discrete values : negative , neutral , or positive ) . in both approaches",
    ", one needs a considerable involvement of humans , at least initially .",
    "humans have to label their perception of the sentiment expressed either in individual words or in short texts .",
    "this sentiment labeling is language- , domain- and often even topic - specific .",
    "an example of a lexicon - based approach that involves a massive human sentiment labeling of words is described by dodds et al .",
    "they collected around 5 million human sentiment assessments of 10,000 common words , each in 10 languages and labeled 50 times .",
    "another well - known sentiment lexicon is sentiwordnet @xcite , constructed semi - automatically for over 100,000 words , but limited to english only .    in this paper",
    "we analyze a set of over 1.6 million twitter posts , in 13 european languages , labeled for sentiment by human annotators .",
    "the labeled tweets are used as training data to train sentiment classifiers for different languages .",
    "an overview of the state - of - the - art of twitter sentiment analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "a more recent overview of the lexicon - based and machine learning methods , and their combination , is in @xcite .",
    "we focus on the quantity and quality of the labeled tweets , and their impact on the performance of sentiment classifiers .",
    "the quality of the labeled tweets is estimated from the agreement between human annotators .",
    "the main hypothesis of the paper is that the annotators agreement provides an upper bound for the classifier performance .",
    "there are several more specific research questions we address : + ( 1 ) are the sentiment classes ordered ?",
    "+ ( 2 ) which evaluation measures are appropriate to quantify and compare the labeled data quality and classifiers performance ? + ( 3 ) how to estimate the quality of the training data ? + ( 4 ) how to compare and select appropriate classifiers ? + ( 5 ) what are acceptable levels of the annotators agreement ? + ( 6 ) how many labeled twitter posts are needed for training a sentiment classifier ?",
    "+ in the paper we present three lines of experiments and results .",
    "one is related to manual annotation of twitter posts and estimations of their quality and dataset properties .",
    "another is about training sentiment classifiers , their performance and comparisons .",

    "we consider their evolution through time , as new tweets get annotated , and how the performance of the classifiers varies with time .",
    "we also discuss the effects of different distributions of the training and application datasets .",
    "conclusions provide answers to the research questions addressed , and give short- and long - term directions of future research .",
    "the methods section provides all the details about the first two lines of experiments and results , specifically about the data , annotations , and sentiment classifiers .",

    "these tweets are domain - specific and provide novel insights and lessons learned when analyzed with the same methods as the language datasets .",

    "determining sentiment expressed in a tweet is not an easy task , and depends on subjective judgment of human annotators .",
    "annotators often disagree between themselves , and even an individual is not always consistent with her / himself .",
    "there are several reasons for disagreements , such as : inherent difficulty of the task ( e.g. , estimating the `` sentiment '' about the future stock movement ) , different vocabularies used in different domains ( e.g. , financial markets vs. environmental issues ) , topic drift in time ( e.g. , events which abruptly shift the topic of discussions on twitter ) , or simply a poor quality of the annotator s work . in the data we analyze ,",

    "if we remove them from the emojis set , the self - agreement increases considerably ( new @xmath0 is 0.720 ) , while the inter - annotators agreement remains almost unchanged ( new @xmath0 is 0.598 ) .",
    "this reconfirms our conclusion that low quality annotators have to be excluded and their annotations removed from the datasets .",
    "we present an analysis of over 1.6 million sentiment annotated twitter posts , by far the largest set made publicly available until now .",

    "our main conclusion is that the choice of a particular classifier type is not so important , but that the training data has a major impact on the results .",
    "there are several specific research questions we address :    \\(1 ) what is the nature and proper formalization of the sentiment classification problem , in particular , are the sentiment values ordered or not ?",
    "we show that there is strong evidence that the sentiment values , _ negative _ , _ neutral _ , and _ positive _ , are perceived as ordered by human annotators ( see subsection on ordering of sentiment values in methods ) .",

    "\\(4 ) how to select the most appropriate classifier ?",
    "our results show that there are no statistically significant differences between the top classifiers . as a consequence",
    ", one should better direct the efforts into higher training data quality .",
    "\\(5 ) what are acceptable levels of annotators agreement ? on the basis of the 17 datasets analyzed , we propose the following rule - of - thumb : for self - agreement , @xmath0@xmath10 , and for the inter - annotator agreement , @xmath0@xmath11 .",
    "\\(6 ) how many posts should be labeled with sentiment for training ? we can not provide conclusive answers here .",
    "it seems that 20,000 high - quality annotations already provide reasonable performance .",
    "the peak performance depends on the inter - annotator agreement and we estimate that around 100,000 annotations are needed .",
    "however , more important than sheer quantity is the quality , and domain- and topic - specific coverage of the posts , as demonstrated on several use - cases .",
    "this gives the following directions for the short - term future work .",
    "the annotation process has to be redesigned to allow for systematic monitoring of the annotation quality .",
    "in particular , more than one annotator per language / domain has to be engaged .",
    "we propose an increased overhead of posts to be labeled twice , from 15% to 20% , both by individuals as well as by two different annotators .",
    "the posts to be labeled multiple times could be based on their `` importance '' as measured by their retweet count @xcite , for example .",
    "the self- and the inter - annotator agreements have to be continuously monitored and warnings issued when they drop below the selected thresholds . extreme disagreements ( as measured by @xmath9 ) should be promptly directed to a `` master '' annotator who has to resolve the disagreement and issue a proper annotation together with a brief guideline .",
    "after each batch of a few thousand annotations , a classification model should be trained and its performance evaluated .",
    "this would help in monitoring the progress towards the inter - annotator agreement as well as in detecting possible abrupt topic shifts .",
    "there is a number of open research questions to be addressed .",
    "one is how to combine the lexicon - based and machine learning approaches to sentiment classification . in @xcite",
    ", authors already showed that the combination of both outperforms the individual approaches .",
    "however , sentiment lexicons are rarely available for languages other than english and require considerable efforts to construct . for several languages , one could use the data published by dodds et al .  @xcite . for the languages covered in this study",
    ", one can construct a basic sentiment lexicon from the annotated tweets , in the analogy to derivation of the emoji sentiment lexicon @xcite .",
    "another research direction , with the potential of considerable performance improvements , is the construction and selection of informative features from short twitter posts . in this study",
    "we apply a number of standard text pre - processing steps to extract just the textual features and eliminate noise in tweets .",
    "however , there is a lot of additional information on twitter to be exploited .",
    "for example , the importance of tweets ( estimated by the retweet count , for example ) , the influence and reliability of twitter users ( estimated by their followers , retweets , and correlations to the real - world events ) , and the network features ( e.g. , neighbourhood and centrality ) that can be attributed to the users , and indirectly to their tweets .",
    "we expect that proper considerations of the broader context in which the tweets are posted can provide for a major leap in quality and predictive potential of the twitter sentiment classifiers .",
    "finally , since the analysis of opinions expressed in social media is an active and evolving research area , we plan to keep up with the newest trends , such as performing entity - based sentiment analysis @xcite , applying deep learning techniques @xcite , analyzing figurative language ( e.g. , irony or sarcasm ) @xcite , and detecting different types of emotions ( e.g. , joy , sadness or anger ) @xcite .",
    "the most interesting direction seems to be a shift from the basic sentiment categories ( negative , neutral , and positive ) of the whole tweet , to the finer - grained emotions about a discussed entity or topic .",
    "the tweets were collected through the public twitter api and are subject to the twitter terms and conditions .",
    "the human annotators were engaged for the purpose of sentiment labeling , and were aware that their annotations will be used to construct the sentiment classification models , and to estimate the annotator self - agreement and the inter - annotator agreement .      in this study",
    "we analyze two corpora of data ( see table  [ tab : train - num ] ) .",
    "the first corpus is a collection of tweets , in 13 european languages , posted between april 2013 and february 2015 .",
    "the tweets , except english , were collected during a joint project with gama system ( http://www.gama-system.si ) , using their perceptionanalytics platform ( http://www.perceptionanalytics.net ) .",

    "the results depend on the evaluation measure used , but generally the top classifiers are not distinguishable .",
    "a standard statistical method for testing the significant differences between multiple classifiers @xcite is the well - known anova and its non - parametric counterpart , the friedman test @xcite . the friedman test ranks the classifiers for each dataset separately .",
    "the best performing classifier is assigned rank 1 , the second best rank 2 , etc . when there are ties , average ranks are assigned .",
