    "@xcite , soulen @xmath6 @xmath7 . successfully determined the spin polarization at the fermi energy for several metals by measuring the differential conductance of f / s metallic point contact .",
    "further calculations @xcite implied that the fermi velocity mismatch between f and s also affects ar conductance of f / s contact , and the conductance may even be enhanced in presence of spin polarization .",

    ", we propose an idea that two sources of spin polarized electrons with different orientations are injected into a superconductor , which can be achieved by a three terminal mesoscopic f / s hybrid structure shown in fig.1 . in this system ,",
    "a central quantum dot ( qd ) is coupled via tunnel barriers to two ferromagnetic electrodes ( f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 ) and a superconducting electrode ( s ) ( hereafter , the system is simply referred as to ( f@xmath0,f@xmath1)-qd - s ) .",

    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec.v .",
    "the system under consideration can be described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath12 \\;\\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\\\ h_t & = & \\sum_{k\\sigma } \\left [ t_{1\\sigma } a_{k\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_\\sigma + h.c\\right ] + \\sum_{k\\sigma } \\left [ t_{2\\sigma } b_{k\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_\\sigma + h.c\\right ] + \\sum_{p\\sigma } \\left [ t_sd_{p\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_\\sigma + h.c\\right ] \\;\\;.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the hamiltonians of f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 in the mean field approximation , with different magnetization orientations and chemical potentials . the spin bands of f@xmath0 ( f@xmath1 ) are split by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) due to the exchange energy",
    ". the magnetization orientation of f@xmath0 is set as z axis , while the orientation of f@xmath1 as z@xmath17 axis which has an angle @xmath18 with respect to z axis .",
    "the operators with the spin - quantization axis z and the operators with the spin - quantization axis z@xmath19 are related by d@xmath20 matrix as @xmath21 @xmath22 describes the quantum dot , in which only one spin degenerate level is considered and the intra - dot interaction is ignored for simplicity .",
    "@xmath23 is the hamiltonian for a bcs  superconductor with the chemical potential fixed to zero as the ground .",
    "@xmath24 depicts the tunneling between qd and f@xmath0 , f@xmath1 and s , coupling different parts of the system together .    since the current through qd can be expressed in terms of the green functions of qd , we first derive the retarded and distribution green functions by dyson equation and keldysh equation . to include the physics of andreev reflections and the spin flip processes in a unified formulation ,",
    "we introduce a 4@xmath254 matrix representation , in which the green function is defined as @xmath26    let @xmath27 denote the fourier transformed retarded green function of qd , and @xmath27 can be solved by dyson equation : @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is the retarded green function of an isolated qd and @xmath30 is the self - energy due to couplings between qd and leads .",
    "@xmath31 can be easily obtained as : @xmath32 while @xmath33 consists of three parts , @xmath34 @xmath35 is the self - energy from the coupling between qd and f@xmath0 , given by @xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the spin - dependent coupling strengths defined by @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the density of states of spin @xmath3 band of f@xmath41 @xmath42 is the self - energy from the coupling between qd and f@xmath1 , given by @xmath43 in which @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined similarly to @xmath49 and @xmath38 .",

    "let @xmath56 denote the fourier transformed distribution green function of qd , and @xmath56 can be obtained by keldysh equation : @xmath57 notice that the advanced green function and self - energy are the hermitian conjugations of the corresponding retarded green function and self - energy . and @xmath58 can be obtained by applying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to each of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 in which @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , in which @xmath75 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "then , the current flowing from f@xmath0 to the qd can be expressed in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath56 as @xmath77 _ { 11 + 33}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] in which we have used the compact notations @xmath78 ^{<}{\\bf % \\equiv a}^r{\\bf b}^{<}{\\bf + a}^{<}{\\bf b}^a$ ] and @xmath79 _ { 11 + 33}\\equiv \\left [ \\;\\;\\right ] _ { 11}+\\left [ \\;\\;\\right ] _ { 33}$ ] .",

    "similarly , one can obtain the current flowing from f@xmath1 into qd simply by exchange the index 1 and 2 .",
    "the current formula eq.(17 ) is the central result of this work , which can be applied to ferromagnetic electrodes f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 with arbitrary spin polarizations , magnetization orientations and bias voltages .    in the following numerical studies ,",
    "we assume that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 process will vanish because of the factor @xmath90 and the fermi function difference @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 process will be ruled out in two special cases : f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 are either equally biased ( section iii ) or fully but oppositely polarized ( section iv ) .",
    "we will concentrate on ar processes @xmath93 ( direct ar through f@xmath0-qd - s ) and @xmath94 ( crossed ar through ( f@xmath95,f@xmath1)-qd - s ) , and investigate several special cases to illustrate the properties of these two ars .",
    "in this section , we study the zero bias conductance by taking @xmath11 . since no bias voltage between f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 , there is no net single - particle current flowing between them . for @xmath88 , the single - particle current from f@xmath0 or f@xmath1 to s is also negligible .",
    "therefore , only ars contribute to the conductance . for simplicity ,",
    "we set @xmath96 and @xmath97 , introduce the spin polarization @xmath98 , and the spin - averaged coupling strength @xmath99 , with @xmath100 @xmath101 for f@xmath0and f@xmath1 respectively .",
    "first consider the simplest case in which @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , then the three - terminal system ( f@xmath9f@xmath1)-qd - s reduces to a two - terminal system f - qd - s , and the conductance is easily obtained from the current formula as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the ratio of the two coupling strengths .",
    "analogous to the matching condition of the fermi velocities in f / s contact ( i.e. , @xmath108 here @xmath109 ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) plays the similar role . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the matching condition can never be satisfied , so @xmath112 decreases monotonously with the increase of @xmath113 ( fig.2a)@xmath114 while for @xmath115 , it exists a certain value of @xmath113 , say @xmath116 , satisfying @xmath117 , so @xmath112 first increases with @xmath113 , reaches its maximum value @xmath118 at @xmath119 , then drops to 0 when @xmath113 approaches to 1 ( fig.2b ) .",
    "this result warns us to be careful to deduce the spin polarization of f from ar conductance of f - qd - s .",
    "next , consider the general case of the three terminal system ( f@xmath9f@xmath1)-qd - s .",
    "similar to the composition of polarized light , the total current ( or total conductance ) of f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 are equivalent to that of an effective ferromagnet f. introduce the spin polarization vectors * @xmath120*@xmath95 and * @xmath120*@xmath1 , where * @xmath120*@xmath121 has the magnitude of @xmath122 and the direction of the magnetization direction of f@xmath121 , with @xmath123 .",

    "then the conductance of f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 can be expressed by the total conductance multiplied by a sharing factor , @xmath132    fig.3 shows the curves of @xmath133 vs @xmath18 ( also can be viewed as @xmath134 vs @xmath135 or @xmath136 vs @xmath18 ) for the symmetric case , in which @xmath137 and @xmath138 . for @xmath139 ,",

    "these results are readily understood by the new matching condition @xmath146 with the effective spin polarization @xmath147 .",
    "two points are noteworthy in the above result : ( 1 ) if f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 are regarded as a whole , the effective polarization can be tuned continuously by changing the angle of the mutual orientations , which is impossible for one chosen ferromagnet . ( 2 ) for @xmath148 , the total conductance for the two ferromagnets ins anti - ferromagnetic alignment is larger than that in ferromagnetic alignment , which is completely different from the effect of gmr or tmr . to describe this new effect of magneto - resistance , define the ratio of andreev reflected magnetic resistance ( @xmath149 ) in ( f@xmath9f@xmath1)-qd - s by @xmath150 and the curves of @xmath149 vs @xmath113 for various @xmath151",
