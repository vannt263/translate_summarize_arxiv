    "a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) could be created in the early state of high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "a jet , produced by initial hard processes , is an important probe to understand the properties of the qgp , since it losses its energy when it passes through the hot partonic medium  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , so - called jet quenching , has been confirmed by many experimental observations .",
    "for example , the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 shows a strong suppression at high transverse momentum @xmath8 in central a+a collisions at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite energies .",
    "the measured elliptic anisotropy ( or elliptic  flow \" ) @xmath9 of final hadrons remains positive above @xmath1010 gev/@xmath11 in a+a collisions at the rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite energies , which discloses a path - length dependence of jet quenching  @xcite . besides these above jet measurements based on high-@xmath12 leading hadrons , the recent lhc measurements on fully reconstructed jets provide a comprehensive characterization of jet quenching .",
    "for instance , a larger dijet @xmath8 asymmetry has been observed in central pb+pb collisions than in p+p collisions at the lhc energy  @xcite , which is thought to be additional direct evidence of jet energy loss in the qgp , as important as the disappearance of the away - side peak in dihadron azimuthal correlation in central au+au collisions at the top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "the data on the elliptic anisotropy of reconstructed jets are recently released by the atlas collaboration , which show nonzero @xmath9 values for the @xmath8 range from 45 to 160 gev/@xmath11 for all centrality bins in pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with a path - length dependence of jet energy loss with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the elliptic anisotropy of reconstructed jets can be theoretically reproduced by the jewel model within a perturbative framework for jet evolution in a qgp medium  @xcite .",
    "the recent studies of higher orders of harmonic flow , especially for triangular flow @xmath13 , have deepened our understanding of many aspects of high energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to study the third order of anisotropy @xmath13 of reconstructed jets , as it serves as the jet response to the initial geometry triangularity which could provide a greater constraint on jet quenching models .",
    "the conversion efficiency @xmath4 , the ratio of jet @xmath14 over the initial spatial eccentricity , is also an important observable to learn about how the energy loss of reconstructed jets depends the initial geometry asymmetry .",

    ", the elliptic anisotropy @xmath9 and triangular anisotropy @xmath13 of reconstructed jets are investigated in pb+pb collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev within a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model , which includes both dynamical evolutions of partonic and hadronic phases . in the remaining part of this paper",
    ", we refer to `` jet '' as a fully reconstructed jet for simplicity unless otherwise noted .",
    "we find that the ampt model can well describe the experimental results about jet @xmath9 .",
    "jet @xmath14 ( n=2 and 3 ) arises owing to the strong interactions between jets and a partonic matter with different geometrical asymmetries .",
    "the other final state interactions , such as hadronization ( via coalescence ) and hadronic rescatterings , show little impact on the measured jet @xmath14 .",

    "it consists of four main stages of high - energy heavy - ion collisions : the initial condition , parton cascade , hadronization , and hadronic rescatterings . in order to increase the simulation efficiency of jets with @xmath15 gev/@xmath11 , a dijet of @xmath16 40 gev/@xmath11",
    "is triggered in the initial condition based on the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath8 primary partons evolve into jet showers full of lower virtuality partons through initial- and final- state qcd radiations . in the string melting mechanism",
    ", all excited strings and jets are fragmented into hadrons according to the lund string fragmentation  @xcite . then these hadrons are converted to quarks according to the flavor and spin structures of their valence quarks . after the melting process , the jet parton showers are converted into clusters of on - shell constituent quarks and anti - quarks , and a plasma of on - shell constituent quarks and anti - quarks is also formed .",
    "next , zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) model  @xcite automatically simulates all possible elastic partonic interactions among the medium quarks and jet shower quarks , but without including inelastic parton interactions or further radiations at present .",
    "when the quarks freeze out , they are recombined into medium hadrons or jet shower hadrons via a simple coalescence model which combines two nearest quarks into a meson and three nearest quarks into a baryon .",
    "the final - state hadronic interactions , including elastic and inelastic hadronic scatterings and resonance decays , can be described by a relativistic hadronic transport ( art ) model  @xcite . for more details on the ampt model , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "recently , the ampt model with a partonic interaction cross section of 1.5 mb has successfully given many qualitative descriptions of the experimental results about pseudorapidity and @xmath8 distributions  @xcite , harmonic flows  @xcite , and reconstructed jet observables , including @xmath17-jet @xmath8 imbalance  @xcite , dijet @xmath8 asymmetry  @xcite , jet fragmentation function  @xcite and jet shape  @xcite in pb+pb collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev .",
