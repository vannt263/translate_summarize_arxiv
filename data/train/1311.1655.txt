    "<S> here we find the increase in 1/f noise of superconducting resonators at low temperatures to be completely incompatible with the standard tunnelling model ( stm ) of two level systems ( tls ) , which has been used to describe low - frequency noise for over three decades . </S>",
    "<S> we revise the stm to include a significant tls - tls interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the new model is able to explain the temperature and power dependence of noise in our measurements , as well as recent studies of individual tls lifetimes using superconducting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were made possible by implementing an ultra - stable frequency - tracking technique used in atomic clocks and by producing a superconducting resonator insensitive to temperature fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter required an epitaxially grown nb film with a pt capping layer to minimize detrimental oxides at all interfaces .    initially introduced to explain unusual thermal properties of glasses with respect to crystals , the standard tunnelling model ( stm ) @xcite has enjoyed considerable success in describing many other phenomena in disordered systems aswell . </S>",
    "<S> the stm assumes the ability for some atoms at low temperatures to quantum mechanically tunnel between adjacent lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> the model has since been adopted to describe two - level systems ( tls ) in many other contexts : for example tls can be caused by tunnelling electrons in barriers , molecules with two quasi - stable configurations etc.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , any influence of dilute impurities on macroscopic properties of materials is often parametrized as due to a bath of non - interacting tls ; so that the stm is applicable . in particular , tls have been suggested as sources of ubiquitous 1/f noise in electronic materials@xcite and are also active at low - temperatures , where the kinetics are dominated by tunnelling @xcite . with the rapid recent progress of new devices for quantum information processing ( qip ) and detector applications , there is a renewed awareness @xcite of the deleterious effects of tls noise . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the stm fails in the extreme low - temperature , low - power limits where these new devices are typically operated and an extension of stm to include specific interactions between tls is necessary to address the shortcomings of this tried and trusted model .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of tls can be conveniently studied using thin - film high quality superconducting microwave resonators , which are important for a number of diverse applications ranging from quantum computation @xcite to submillimeter and far - infrared astronomy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here tls , mainly located at interfaces , cause 1/f noise that manifests as an instability in the centre frequency , and device performance can be severely hampered by the resulting jitter . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism can be understood by noting that the tls are associated with dipoles that couple strongly to the electric field and thus modifies the dielectric constant , causing them to be a source of noise . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason there have been a number of studies of tls noise in superconducting resonators@xcite , however the results have not been explainable with the stm . </S>",
    "<S> this has motivated the development of new models which either assume the presence of additional sources of dissipation e.g. caused by edge defects @xcite or alternatively , explain the shortcomings of the stm by re - evaluating the underlying assumptions about the nature of tls .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study 1/f noise in specially designed low noise epitaxial superconducting resonators with high temperature stability . </S>",
    "<S> we find the results to be inconsistent with the stm . to account for these results </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new model , which includes interactions between tls . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions lead to spectral diffusion which alters the properties of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as well as explaining our results , the new model also explains results of other recent studies @xcite that used phase qubits as a way to probe individual tls .    our model </S>",
    "<S> is conceptually shown in fig  [ fig : resonator ] : a resonator ( fig  [ fig : resonator]a ) with centre frequency @xmath0 couples to an ensemble of coherent tls with energy splitting @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> due to non negligible interactions with surrounding tls , the resonant tls acquire a temperature dependent width and are affected by strongly coupled slow incoherent ( `` classical '' ) fluctuators ( fig  [ fig : resonator]b ) . the latter cause an energy drift bringing the resonant tls in and out of resonance </S>",
    "<S> . one key prediction of this new model is that it results in a low frequency noise for a superconducting resonator that _ increases _ as the temperature is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this increase can be directly related to a microscopic parameter @xmath2 associated with the slight suppression of the density of tls states at low energy .    by performing a detailed study and analysis of the very low frequency noise in high quality nb resonators </S>",
    "<S> we are able to validate this model and extract values for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are performed in various microwave powers , down to average energies corresponding to @xmath4 photons in the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial feature of our measurements is the long measurement time ( @xmath5 ) leading to high statistical confidence . </S>",
    "<S> two resonators , denoted res1 and res2 are studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the resonators ( shown in fig  [ fig : resonator]a ) are made of 50  nm thick epitaxial nb film with a 5  nm pt capping layer grown by laser ablation on r - plane sapphire ( see methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonators have centre frequencies ( @xmath6 ) are between 4 - 8 ghz , and intrinsic quality factors ( @xmath7 ) above @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> further parameters can be found in table [ tab : params ] of methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed by continuously monitoring the time - varying centre frequency @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> for all measurements presented in this work , the quantity of interest is the fractional frequency spectra . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 , where , @xmath6 is the nominal centre frequency of the resonator , and @xmath11 the fourier frequency ( see methods for details ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the central result of this work can be found in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tem1 ] , which shows the level of 1/f ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tem1]a ) noise at 0.1  hz plotted for the temperature range 60 mk - 500 mk at three different microwave drive levels ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tem1]b ) . for both resonators </S>",
    "<S> we find a stronger than 1/t temperature dependence for all microwave drives . </S>",
    "<S> this data can be fit to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a power dependent constant . where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for res1 and res2 respectively . hence , both sets of measurement suggest a temperature dependence stronger than 1/t .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the 1/f level depends on the microwave drive , or more precisely , on the energy stored in the resonator ; consistent with our previous results@xcite . at the highest powers ( inset of fig  [ fig : tem1]a ) </S>",
    "<S> we see a saturation due to amplifier noise at a level consistent with other estimates@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , fig  [ fig : psd_power ] shows that as power is decreased the resonator noise increases , until it saturates in the low power limit , at a level found to be temperature dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss whether the jitter in the resonator frequency may be caused by inductance fluctuations from surface spins . </S>",
    "<S> the argument in favour of this is that both frequency jitter and inductance fluctuations @xcite exhibit a @xmath16 frequency dependence for @xmath17 which increases as the temperature is reduced in the range @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is to be noted that the details of the behaviours are very different : inductance noise acquires an approximate @xmath16 dependence only at the lowest temperatures , whilst at higher temperatures it is described by much smaller exponents@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at @xmath19 the inductance noise is almost temperature independent ; at all frequencies the temperature dependence ceases below @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the power saturation of the noise seen in our resonators ( fig  [ fig : psd_power ] ) implies that the frequency of the relevant excitation is close to the frequency of the resonator , e.g. @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies are too large for a dilute spin system with the densities consistent with direct observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed measurements in weak ( @xmath21 mt ) in - plane fields which would be expected to affect these spin system , but not the superconductor@xcite , and observe no change in the noise level .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider whether the stm could describe the jitter in the resonator frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the central assumption of the stm is that certain atoms or groups of atoms may tunnel between roughly equivalent potential energy minima separated in energy by an asymmetric splitting @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnelling coupling energy is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a parameter describing the extent of wave - function overlapping between the states in the wells . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of each tls has the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 is the tls energy splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the stm assumes that the energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 are uncorrelated and have joint probability distribution : @xmath30 in a wide ( atomic ) range of energies , with a constant @xmath31 which is material - dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> the tls interact with the external electric field @xmath32 and the strain field @xmath33 according to the hamiltonian @xmath34 \\sigma^z}$ ] where @xmath35 is the electric dipole moment and @xmath36 is the elastic dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> different tls interact between themselves via long range dipole - dipole interaction ( or phonon exchange ) with an effective strength given by the dimensionless parameter @xmath37 for electric ( elastic ) interactions , where @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the medium , @xmath39 is the density of the glass and @xmath40 is the sound velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless parameter is very small @xmath41 such that within the stm interaction between tls is assumed to be irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing and relaxation of the tls is due to their interaction with phonons ; giving a tls relaxation rate @xmath42 \\delta^2 e \\coth \\left ( e/2 k_b t\\right ) } $ ] , where @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of @xmath44 due to the distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath28 for a given @xmath45 is wide and increases very rapidly near @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermal fluctuations - absorption or emission of thermal phonons by a collection of independent tls - could cause a jitter in the resonators centre frequency ( equivalent to a fluctuating dielectric constant @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the number of activated tls is proportional to temperature and the effect of each tls is small in @xmath48 , the stm predicts@xcite a noise spectrum that vanishes quadratically for @xmath49 , in striking contrast to the results of fig  [ fig : tem1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the regime of strong applied electric field our calculations show that one should expect a very weak power dependence of the noise spectra , in disagreement with the results of fig  [ fig : psd_power]b . </S>",
    "<S> as such the stm is completely incompatible with our results .    </S>",
    "<S> other experimental studies have also found evidence for deviations from the stm . </S>",
    "<S> individual tls can be studied spectroscopically by superconducting qubits , allowing direct measurement of the relaxation time @xmath50 and the dephasing time @xmath51 of _ individual _ tls@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of these lifetimes has also been studied@xcite , finding the expected wide distribution of relaxation rates for tls , but in disagreement with stm predictions the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate is strong . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dephasing rate shows an anomalous behaviour : @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> studies of bulk ensembles of tls using high - q superconducting resonators have also found deviations from stm predictions with resonators showing a logarithmic power dependence in contrast to the square root dependence predicted by the stm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the extracted density of states of tls shows a weak power law dependence @xmath53 , with @xmath54 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with several studies in glasses where a slight suppression of the density of states at low energies : @xmath55 with @xmath56 was found @xcite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it was found that in thin oxide @xmath57 layers , dipole - dipole interactions between tls may play a key role up to 100 mk @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all of this leads us to conclude that at least for thin oxide layers the stm does not correctly describe the properties of tls . </S>",
    "<S> instead we argue that the noise originates from thermally activated slow fluctuators that are also responsible for @xmath16 charge noise in superconducting devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the resonator noise is generated by the switching of fluctuators that are located in the vicinity of quantum tls which are in resonance with the high frequency electric field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the stm , the interaction between tls is relevant for our model and the density of low - energy states is slightly non - uniform . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the non - uniform density of states is a natural consequence of strong interaction because the latter always leads to the formation of the pseudogap by efros - shklovskii mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the conclusion of the small size of the interaction is based on the assumption that tls are local objects located at distances much larger than their size which was not proven experimentally  even for conventional glasses .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show qualitatively that the assumptions of the dominant role of tls - tls interaction and the energy dependent density of states explain the present data as well as the results of phase qubit experiments@xcite .    similarly to that of optical homogeneous linewidth @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the dephasing rate of the resonant tls can be estimated by associating the dephasing process with the thermal relaxation of off - resonant tls that interact strongly with it . since for a density of states @xmath58 , </S>",
    "<S> the number of the off - resonant tls is proportional to @xmath59 , the resulting width is @xmath60 . due to this width , </S>",
    "<S> phononless relaxation processes between resonant tls become possible with rate @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this power law is expected to hold at low temperature even whilst it dominates over the direct phonon emission . from our data </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath62 , as a result we get an estimate for the dephasing rate in very good agreement with the one measured in phase qubit @xcite , associated with a value of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the wide distribution of relaxation rates implies the presence of very slow tls in the vicinity of the resonant ones . </S>",
    "<S> these very slow tls have coherence times much shorter than the tunnelling rate and thus they can be considered as classical fluctuators . </S>",
    "<S> their presence is independently revealed by charge fluctuations that display a @xmath16 power spectrum@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the classical fluctuators on the resonant quantum tls is to generate an energy drift of the tls with a @xmath16 spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this only occurs if the interaction strength between the classical and coherent tls is greater than the tls width , i.e. if the slow fluctuators are located within a distance @xmath64 from the resonant quantum tls . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of this picture is that the noise increases as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that as the width decreases with temperature the energy drift becomes more visible . as a result , with decreasing temperature the noise _ sensitivity _ increases , even if the number of thermally excited fluctuators decreases . </S>",
    "<S> analytical computations based on bloch equations formalism give the following result for the noise spectrum @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the rabi frequency and @xmath67 is the applied electric field . using the measured value of @xmath68 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : tem1 ] ) allows this equation to describe all the results reported in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the agreement of this value with that usually obtained for various glasses .    </S>",
    "<S> our model can also account for the power dependence ( see fig  [ fig : psd_power]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since @xmath69 , the saturation term becomes temperature dependent . for low powers </S>",
    "<S> the spectra has an overall strong temperature dependence proportional to @xmath70 , whereas at high power our theory predicts that the temperature dependence of the spectra is constant . </S>",
    "<S> fig  [ fig : psd_power]b is a fit to the overall temperature and power dependence of the noise at @xmath71 hz : @xmath72 . in the fit , we used the measured value of @xmath73 ; where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are sample - dependent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath76 for all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , the value of @xmath75 appears to change when the temperature is decreased below @xmath77  200  mk . for temperatures </S>",
    "<S> above 200  mk we find @xmath75  =  3.5x10@xmath78 and for temperatures below 200  mk we find @xmath75  =  2.5x10@xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> as previously explained , the model is justified at lowest temperatures , so the observed cross - over between the two regimes is not surprising . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that while saturation is seen at all temperatures in fig  [ fig : psd_power ] , the saturation at the lowest temperature is the least clear . although it should be noted that clear </S>",
    "<S> saturation in the low temperature limit has been observed elsewhere@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the relevance of the interaction between tls in thin oxide layers does not contradict the existing body of the data obtained previously on bulk amorphous materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do put forward the notion that results within literature on bulk materials may also benefit from a model including a dominant tls - tls interaction .    in conclusion , we have performed measurements of the @xmath16 noise in superconducting resonators and have found an inverse temperature dependence with @xmath80 , with @xmath2  =  0.2 - 0.4 in strong agreement with results on individual tls in phase qubits@xcite . we also find a strong scaling power dependence of the noise with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that these results are incompatible with a presence of surface spins ruled out the stm by observing of a non vanishing temperature dependence and a temperature dependent saturation power . instead , our data can be explained by assuming a relevant interaction between tls . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a suppression of density of low energy states , with a small exponent @xmath81 that is in remarkable agreement with previous measurement on glasses , and those on individual tls lifetimes .    </S>",
