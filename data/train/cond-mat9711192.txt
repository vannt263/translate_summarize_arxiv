    "multichannel kondo impurity models @xcite have recently attracted considerable attention , for several reasons .",
    "first , in the overscreened case , they provide an explicit example of a non - fermi liquid ground - state .",
    "second , these models can be studied by a variety of controlled techniques , and provide invaluable testing grounds for theoretical methods dealing with correlated electron systems .",
    "one of the most recent and fruitful development in this respect has been the conformal field - theory approach developed by affleck and ludwig @xcite . finally , multichannel models have experimental relevance to tunneling phenomena in quantum dots and two level systems @xcite , and possibly also to some heavy - fermion compounds @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a generalisation of the multi - channel kondo model , in which the spin symmetry group is extended from @xmath10 to @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the model has a @xmath1 symmetry among the @xmath11 `` channels '' ( flavours ) of conduction electrons .",
    "we focus here on spin representations which are such that the model is in the non - fermi liquid _",
    "overscreened _ regime .",
    "we shall derive in this paper several universal properties of this @xmath12 kondo model in the low - temperature regime .",
    "specifically , we obtain : the zero - temperature residual entropy , the zero - temperature impurity resistivity and t - matrix , and the critical exponents governing the leading low - temperature behaviour of the impurity specific heat , susceptibility and resistivity .",
    "these results will be obtained using two different approaches .",
    "it is one of the main motivations of this paper to compare these two approaches in some detail .",
    "first ( sec.[cftsec ] ) , we apply cft methods to study the model for general values of @xmath4 and @xmath11 . then , we study the limit of large @xmath4 and @xmath11 , with @xmath13 fixed .",
    "this limit was previously considered by cox and ruckenstein @xcite , in connection with the `` non - crossing approximation '' ( nca ) [ nca ] .",
    "there is a crucial difference between our work and that of ref.@xcite however , which is that we keep track of the quantum number specifying the spin representation of the impurity by imposing a constraint ( on the abrikosov fermions representing the impurity ) which also scales proportionally to @xmath4 . as a result",
    ", the solution of the model at large @xmath4 follows from a true saddle - point principle , with controllable fluctuations in @xmath14 .",
    "hence , a detailed quantitative comparison of the large - n limit to the cft results can be made .",
    "the saddle - point equations are coupled integral equations similar in structure to those of the nca , except for the different handling of the constraint .",
    "the @xmath9 impurity entropy and residual resistivity are obtained for the first time in analytical form in this paper from a low - energy analysis of these coupled integral equations and shown to agree with the large - n limit of the cft results .",
    "we also demonstrate that the spectral functions resulting from these equations take a universal scaling form in the limit @xmath15 , which is precisely that expected from the conformal invariance of the problem .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model considered in this paper reads : @xmath16 in this expression , @xmath17 creates an electron in the conduction band , with momentum @xmath18 , channel ( flavour ) index @xmath19 and @xmath0 spin index @xmath20 .",
    "the conduction electrons transform under the fundamental representation of the @xmath0 group , with generators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "they interact with a localised spin degree of freedom placed at the origin , @xmath23 which is assumed to transform under a given irreducible representation @xmath24 of the @xmath0 group .    in the one - channel case ( @xmath25 ) , and when @xmath24 is taken to be the fundamental representation , this is the coqblin - schrieffer model of a conduction gas interacting with a localised atomic level with angular momentum @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) @xcite . in this article , we are interested in the possible non - fermi liquid behaviour associated with the multi - channel generalisation ( @xmath3 ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "we shall mostly focus on the case where @xmath24 corresponds to antisymmetric tensors of @xmath5 indices , _",
    "i.e _ the young tableau associated with @xmath24 is made of a _ single column _ of @xmath5 indices . in that case",
    ", it is convenient to use an explicit representation of the localised spin in terms of @xmath4 species of auxiliary fermions @xmath28 ( @xmath20 ) , constrained to obey : @xmath29 so that the @xmath30 ( traceless ) components of @xmath31 can be represented as : @xmath32 . for these choices of @xmath24",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as ( after a reshuffling of indices using a fierz identity ): @xmath33 in a recent paper @xcite , the case of a _ symmetric _ representation of the impurity spin ( corresponding to a young tableau made of a single _ line _ of @xmath34 boxes ) has been considered by two of us . in that case , a transition from overscreening to underscreening is found as a function of the `` size '' @xmath34 of the impurity spin . in contrast , the antisymmetric representations considered in the present paper always lead to overscreening ( except for @xmath25 which is exactly screened ) , as shown below .",
    "as long as only the overscreened regime is considered , the analysis of the present paper applies to symmetric representations as well , up to some straightforward replacements .",
    "it is easily checked that a weak antiferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath35 ) grows under renormalisation for all @xmath11 and @xmath4 , and all representations @xmath24 of the local spin .",
    "what is needed is a physical argument in order to determine whether the r.g flow takes @xmath36 all the way to strong coupling ( underscreened or exactly screened cases ) , or whether an intermediate non - fermi liquid fixed point exists ( overscreened cases ) .",
    "following the nozieres and blandin @xcite analysis of the multichannel @xmath10 model , we consider the strong - coupling fixed point @xmath37 . in this limit , the impurity spin binds a certain number of conduction electrons ( at most @xmath38 because of the pauli principle ) .",
    "the resulting bound - state corresponds to a new spin representation @xmath39 which is dictated by the minimisation of the kondo energy . for the specific choices of @xmath24 above",
    ", we have proven that :    * in the one - channel case ( @xmath25 ) and for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath39 is the `` singlet '' representation ( of dimension @xmath40 ) .",
    "it is obtained by binding @xmath41 conduction electrons to the @xmath5 pseudo - fermions @xmath28 .",
    "the impurity spin is thus _ exactly screened _ at strong - coupling .",
    "* for all multi - channel cases ( @xmath42 , arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , the ground - state at the strong - coupling fixed point is the representation @xmath39 characterised by a rectangular young tableau with @xmath41 lines and @xmath43 columns .",
    "its dimension @xmath44 ( _ i.e _ the degeneracy of the strong - coupling bound - state ) is larger than the degeneracy at zero coupling , given by @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "the young - tableau associated with the strong - coupling state in both cases is depicted in fig.[drawsc ] .",
    "the detailed proof of these statements and the explicit construction of @xmath39 are given in appendix [ appendixstrongcoupling ] .",
    "these properties are sufficient to establish that :    * in the one - channel case , the strong coupling fixed point is stable under r.g . , and hence the impurity spin is exactly screened by the kondo effect . * in the multi - channel case , a direct r.g flow from weak to strong - coupling is impossible , thereby suggesting the existence of an intermediate coupling fixed - point ( `` overscreening '' ) .",
    "the connection between these statements and the above results on the nature and degeneracy of the strong - coupling bound - state is clear on physical grounds .",
    "indeed , it is not possible to flow under renormalisation from a fixed point with a lower ground - state degeneracy to a fixed - point with a higher one , because the effective number of degrees of freedom can only decrease under r.g .",
    "hence , no flow away from the strong - coupling fixed point is possible in the one - channel ( @xmath25 ) case since the strong - coupling state is nondegenerate .",
    "also , no direct flow from weak to strong coupling is possible for @xmath48 since @xmath49 .",
    "these statements can be made more rigorous @xcite by considering the impurity entropy defined as : @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denotes the contribution to the entropy which is proportional to the volume @xmath52 ( and is simply the contribution of the conduction electron gas ) , and care has been taken in specifying the order of the infinite - volume and zero - temperature limits . at the weak coupling",
    "fixed point @xmath53 , while @xmath54 at strong - coupling .",
    "@xmath55 must decrease under renormalisation @xcite , a property which is the analogue for boundary critical phenomena to zamolodchikov s `` c - theorem '' in the bulk .",
    "this suggests a r.g flow of the kind indicated above .",
    "this conclusion can of course be confirmed by a perturbative calculation ( in the hopping amplitude ) around the strong - coupling fixed - point @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath55 will be calculated below at the intermediate fixed - point in the overscreened case , and found to be non - integer ( as in the @xmath56 case @xcite ) .",
    "having established the existence of an intermediate fixed - point for @xmath57 , we sketch some of its properties that can be obtained from conformal field - theory ( cft ) methods .",
    "this is a straightforward extension to the @xmath0 case of affleck and ludwig s approach for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is not to present a complete conformal field - theory solution , but simply to derive those properties which will be compared with the large - n explicit solution given below .    in the cft approach ,",
    "the model ( [ ham1 ] ) is first mapped at low - energy onto a @xmath58-dimensional model of @xmath38 chiral fermions . at a fixed point",
    ", this model has a local conformal symmetry based on the kac - moody algebra @xmath59 corresponding to the spin - flavour - charge decomposition of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the free - fermion spectrum at the weak - coupling fixed point can be organised in multiplets of this symmetry algebra : to each level corresponds a primary operator in the spin , flavour and charge sectors .",
    "a major insight @xcite is then that the spectrum at the infra - red stable , intermediate coupling fixed point can be obtained from a `` fusion principle '' .",
    "specifically , the spectrum is obtained by acting , in the spin sector , on the primary operator associated with a given free - fermion state , with the primary operator of the @xmath60 algebra corresponding to the representation @xmath24 of the impurity spin ( leaving unchanged the flavour and charge sectors ) .",
    "the `` fusion rules '' of the algebra determine the new operators associated with each energy level at the intermediate fixed point .",
    "this fusion principle also relates the impurity entropy @xmath55 as defined above to the `` modular s - matrix '' @xmath61 of the @xmath62 algebra ( this is the matrix which specifies the action of a modular transformation on the irreducible characters of the algebra corresponding to a given irreducible representation @xmath24 ) .",
    "specifically , denoting by @xmath63 the trivial ( identity ) representation : @xmath64 the expression of the modular s - matrix for @xmath62 can be found in the litterature @xcite .",
    "we have found particularly useful to make use of an elegant formulation introduced by douglas @xcite , which is briefly explained in appendices [ appendixstrongcoupling ] and [ modsmatrix ] .",
    "for the representations @xmath24 associated to a single column of length @xmath5 ( corresponding to ( [ constr ] ) ) , one finds using this representation : @xmath65 it is easily checked that indeed @xmath66 for all values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "note also that this expression correctly yields @xmath67 in the exactly screened case @xmath25 ( for arbitrary @xmath68 ) .",
    "the low - temperature behaviour of various physical quantities can also be obtained from the cft approach . at the intermediate coupling fixed point",
    ", the local impurity spin acquires the scaling dimension of the primary operator of the @xmath69 algebra associated with the ( @xmath30 dimensional ) adjoint representation of @xmath0 .",
    "its conformal dimension @xmath70 ( such that @xmath71 at @xmath9 ) reads : @xmath72",
    "integrating this correlation function , this implies that the _ local susceptibility _",
    "@xmath73 ( corresponding to the coupling of an external field to the impurity spin _ only _ ) diverges at low temperature when @xmath74 , while it remains finite for @xmath75 : @xmath76 exactly at the fixed point , the singular contributions to the specific heat and _ impurity susceptibility _ @xmath77 ( defined by coupling a magnetic field to the total spin density ) vanish @xcite . indeed , the singular behaviour is controlled by the leading irrelevant operator compatible with all symmetries that can be generated .",
    "an obvious candidate for this operator is the spin , flavour and charge singlet obtained by contracting the spin current with the adjoint primary operator above , @xmath78 .",
    "it has dimension @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to a singular contribution to the impurity susceptibility ( arising from perturbation theory at _ second order _ in the irrelevant operator @xcite ) of the same nature than for @xmath80 given in ( [ chiloc ] ) : @xmath81 .",
    "another irrelevant operator can be constructed in the flavour sector in an analogous manner , namely @xmath82 .",
    "this operator has dimension @xmath83 , which is thus lower than the above operator in the spin sector when @xmath75 .",
    "this operator could a priori contribute to the low - temperature behaviour of the specific heat , which would lead to a divergent specific heat coefficient @xmath84 for both @xmath85 and @xmath75 . on the basis of the explicit large - n calculation presented below ,",
    "we believe however that this operator is _ not generated _ for model ( [ ham1 ] ) when the conduction band d.o.s is taken to be perfectly flat and the cutoff is taken to infinity ( conformal limit ) , so that the specific heat ratio has the same behaviour than the susceptibilities above : @xmath86 .",
    "if the model is extended to an impurity spin with internal flavour degrees of freedom , this operator will however show up ( leading to @xmath87 for @xmath75 ) .",
    "it also appears ( see below ) if an anderson model generalisation of model ( [ ham1 ] ) is considered away from particle - hole symmetry .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the large - n limit of this model . this will be done by setting : @xmath88 and taking the limit @xmath89 for fixed values of @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , so that the number of channels is also taken to be large . in ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , cox and ruckenstein considered this limit while holding @xmath5 fixed ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "they obtained in this limit identical results to those of the `` non - crossing approximation '' ( nca ) @xcite . here",
    ", we shall proceed in a different manner by _ taking @xmath5 to be large as well _ :",
    "@xmath93 this insures that a true saddle - point exists , with controllable fluctuations order by order in @xmath14 .",
    "it will also allow us to study the dependence on the representation @xmath24 of the local spin , parametrised by @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the approach of ref.@xcite is recovered in the limit @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) .",
    "the action corresponding to the functional integral formulation of model ( [ ham2 ] ) reads : @xmath97 in this expression , the conduction electrons have been integrated out in the bulk , keeping only degrees of freedom at the impurity site .",
    "@xmath98 is the on - site green s function associated with the conduction electron bath . in order to decouple the kondo interaction , an auxiliary bosonic field @xmath99",
    "is introduced in each channel , and the conduction electrons can be integrated out , leaving us with the effective action : @xmath100    the quartic term in this expression can be decoupled formally using two bi - local fields @xmath101 and @xmath102 conjugate to @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively , leading to the action : @xmath105 the @xmath106 and @xmath107 fields can now be integrated out to yield : @xmath108   + k \\mbox{tr } \\ln [ { { 1}\\over{j } } \\delta(\\tau-\\tau ' ) - q(\\tau',\\tau ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this final form of the action involves only the three fields @xmath5 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and scales globally as @xmath4 thanks to the scalings @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "let us note that the field @xmath125 is simply a commuting auxiliary field rather than a true boson ( its equal - time commutator vanishes ) .",
    "as a result @xmath126 is a @xmath127periodic function , but does not share the usual other properties of a bosonic green function ( in particular at high frequency ) .    finally , @xmath128 is determined by the third saddle point equation : @xmath129 these equations are identical in structure to the usual nca equations , except for the last equation ( [ eqlambda ] ) which implements the constraint and allows us to keep track of the choice of representation for the impurity spin .",
    "the analysis of the nca equations in ref.@xcite can be applied in order to find the behaviour of the green s functions in the low temperature , long time regime defined by : @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 is the kondo temperature ) . in this regime , a power - law decay of the green s functions",
    "is found : @xmath132 the scaling dimensions @xmath133 and @xmath134 can be determined explicitly by inserting this form into the above saddle - point equations and making a low - frequency analysis , as explained in appendix [ detailcalcul ] .",
    "this yields : @xmath135 the overall consistency of ( [ sp],[defsigma ] ) at large time also constrains the product of amplitudes @xmath136 ( eq.([prodamplitude ] ) in appendix [ detailcalcul ] ) and dictates the behaviour of the self - energies ( denoting by @xmath137 the conduction bath density of states at the fermi level ) : @xmath138 together with the sum rule : @xmath139 the expression ( [ exponents ] ) of the scaling dimensions @xmath140 and @xmath141 is in complete agreement with the cft result .",

    "also , the local impurity spin correlation function , given in the large - n limit by @xmath146 is found to decay as @xmath147 , with @xmath148 in agreement with the cft result ( [ spindim ] ) .    as will be shown below however",
    ", these asymptotic behaviours at @xmath9 do not provide enough information to allow for the computation of the low - temperature behaviour of the impurity free - energy and to determine the @xmath9 impurity entropy ( [ defentropy ] ) .",
    "one actually needs to determine the green s functions in the limit @xmath149 , but for an arbitrary value of the ratio @xmath150 ( _ i.e _ to analyze the low - temperature , low - frequency behaviour of ( [ sp],[defsigma ] ) keeping the ratio @xmath8 fixed @xcite ) .",
    "it is easily seen that in this limit the green s functions and their associated spectral densities @xmath151 obey a _ scaling behaviour _ :    @xmath152    @xmath153    in these expressions , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are _ universal scaling functions _ which depend only on @xmath90 and @xmath94 and _ not on the specific shape of the conduction band or the cutoff_. these scaling functions will now be found in explicit form .",

    "the expression of the scaling functions @xmath154 in that case can be easily guessed from general principles of conformal invariance .",
    "the idea is that , in the limit @xmath159 with @xmath150 fixed , the finite - temperature green s function can be obtained from the @xmath9 green s function by applying the conformal transformation @xmath160 @xcite . applying this to the @xmath9 power - law decay given by ( [ longtime ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the well - known result for the scaling functions ( @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 with the periodicity requirements @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "note that these functions satisfy the additional symmetry @xmath165 indicating that _ they can only apply to the particle - hole symmetric case _ @xmath156 .",
    "the corresponding form of the scaling functions associated with the spectral densities ( [ scalrho ] ) reads , with @xmath166 ( after a calculation detailed in appendix [ detailcalcul ] ) : @xmath167 note that the @xmath168 singularity of the @xmath9 case is now recovered for @xmath169 : @xmath170 it is an interesting calculation , performed in detail in appendix [ detailcalcul ] , to check that indeed these scaling functions do solve the large-@xmath4 equations ( [ sp],[defsigma ] ) at finite temperature in the scaling regime . that nca - like integral equations obey the finite - temperature scaling properties dictated by conformal invariance has not , to our knowledge , been pointed out in the previous litterature .",
    "let us move to the general case of representations with @xmath171 in which the particle - hole symmetry between pseudo - fermions is broken .",

    "this corresponds to the following analytic behaviour of the green s function in the complex frequency plane , as @xmath175 : @xmath176 equivalently , this means that the symmetry @xmath177 is broken , and that the scaling function @xmath178 must satisfy ( from the behaviour of its fourier transform ) : @xmath179 we have found , by an explicit analysis of the saddle - point and constraint equations in the scaling regime , which is detailed in appendix [ detailcalcul ] , that the full scaling functions for this asymmetric case are very simply related to the symmetric ones at @xmath156 , through : @xmath180 where the parameter @xmath181 is simply related to @xmath172 so as to obey ( [ asym ] ) : @xmath182 fourier transforming , this leads to the scaling functions for the spectral densities : @xmath183    the thermal scaling function for the fermionic spectral density @xmath184 and the bosonic one @xmath185 are plotted in fig.([dos ] ) for various values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath181 .",

    "the point which remains to be clarified is the explicit relation between the asymmetry parameter @xmath172 and the parameter @xmath94 specifying the representation .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .    before turning to this point , we briefly comment on the cft interpretation of the asymmetry parameter @xmath172 ( or @xmath181 ) associated with the particle - hole asymmetry of the fermionic fields .",
    "the form ( [ cftscaling ] ) of the correlation functions at finite temperature in the scaling limit can be viewed as those of the exponential of a compact bosonic field with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "let us clarify the relation between the spectral asymmetry parameter @xmath172 , and the parameter @xmath94 specifying the spin representation .",
    "that such a relation exists in universal form is a remarkable fact : indeed @xmath172 is _ a low - energy parameter _ associated with the low - frequency behaviour of the spectral density , while @xmath94 is the total pseudo - fermion number related by the constraint equation ( [ eqlambda ] ) to an integral of the spectral density _ over all frequencies_. the situation is similar to that of the friedel sum rule in impurity models , or to luttinger theorem in a fermi liquid , and indeed the derivation of the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath172 follows similar lines @xcite .",
    "it is in a sense a friedel sum rule for the quasiparticles carrying the spin degrees of freedom ( namely , the pseudofermions @xmath28 ) .",
    "we start from the constraint equation ( [ eqlambda ] ) written at zero - temperature as : @xmath192 in this expression , and below in this section , @xmath193 and @xmath194 denote the ( feynman ) @xmath9 green s functions while the retarded green s functions are denoted by @xmath195 . using analytic continuation of ( [ defsigma ] ) , we have : @xmath196 so that ( [ q01 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath197 e^{i\\omega t}\\ ] ] in this expression , the bosonic part ( which vanishes altogether ) has been included in order to transform further the terms involving derivatives of the self energy , using analyticity .",
    "this transformation is only possible if both fermionic and bosonic terms are considered .",
    "this is because the luttinger - ward functional @xcite of this model involves both green s functions .",

    "it can also be read off from the behaviour of the scaling function @xmath212 for @xmath213 .",
    "thus , from ( [ fullgreengenerales ] ) we can also read off @xmath214 : @xmath215 taking into account that @xmath216 and that @xmath217 we have @xmath218 .",

    ", we finally obtain the desired relation between @xmath94 and @xmath172 ( or @xmath181 ) : @xmath220 this , together with ( [ fullgreengenerales ] ) , fully determines the universal scaling form of the spectral functions in the low - frequency , low temperature limit .",
    "the impurity contribution to the free - energy ( per colour of spin ) @xmath221 reads , at the saddle point : @xmath222 this expression can be derived either directly from the saddle - point effective action ( in which case the last term arises from the quadratic term in @xmath5 and @xmath109 ) , or from the relation between the free - energy and the luttinger - ward functional .",
    "@xmath223 is the free energy of the conduction electrons . in ( [ free1 ] )",
    "the formulas @xmath224 are ambiguous .",
    "we must precisely define which regularisation of these sums we consider : the actual value of the sums depends on the precise definition of the functional integral . for the fermionic field , the standard procedure of adding and substracting the contribution of a free local fermion , and introducing an oscillating term to regularize",
    "the matsubara sum holds : @xmath225 the situation is somewhat less familiar for the bosonic field . as pointed out above",
    ", the latter is merely a commuting auxiliary field ( rather than a true boson ) .",

    "we conclude that @xmath241 , so that the last term in ( [ free1 ] ) does not contribute to the zero - temperature entropy in the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "let us express the remaining terms in ( [ free1 ] ) as integrals over real frequencies , using the regularisations introduced above .",

    "this is not the case however , for two reasons : i ) the argument of the green s functions appearing in ( [ free ] ) are _ not _ continuous at @xmath245 , so that a linear term in @xmath246 does appear ( as expected from the non - zero value of @xmath55 ) ii ) the green s functions have an _ intrinsic _ temperature dependence , and the full scaling functions computed above must be used in ( [ free ] ) .",
    "more precisely , when computing the difference @xmath247 , the leading term is obtained by replacing the green s function by their scaling form ( [ fullgreengenerales ] ) .",
    "these considerations lead to the following expression of the impurity entropy ( per spin colour ) @xmath248 at zero - temperature for @xmath228 : @xmath249    in this expression , @xmath250 denotes the arguments of the scaling functions , obtained from ( [ fullgreengenerales ] ) : @xmath251    from ( [ entropy ] ) , we obtain with @xmath252 @xmath253 to perform the integration , we note that @xmath254 and we obtain finally the simple expression @xmath255 this can also be rewritten , after a change of integration variable , as : @xmath256\\ ] ] with @xmath257 this coincides with the large - n limit of the cft result , eq.([entropieimpuretecft ] ) , in the particle - hole symmetric case",

    ", we thus have : @xmath262 and in particular : @xmath263 we shall directly use this equation in order to compute the residual entropy , by calculating the linear correction in @xmath246 to @xmath128 , and then integrating over @xmath94 .",
    "this method shortcuts the full low - temperature expansion of the free - energy ( as done in the previous section ) , which actually turns out to be quite a difficult task to perform correctly for @xmath227 @xcite . in order to calculate this linear correction",

    "as @xmath265 when @xmath266 we have : @xmath267 this shows that @xmath268 is the discontinuity of the derivative of @xmath269 with respect to @xmath270 at @xmath271 : @xmath272 let us define @xmath273 by : @xmath274 where @xmath181 is the spectral asymmetry parameter in eq.([relationq0theta ] ) ( at this stage we emphasize that the full finite temperature , finite cutoff , green s function @xmath275 is considered ) .",

    "( [ ansatzcasgene ] ) holds , can be reached by fixing @xmath246 and sending @xmath131 to infinity .",
    "since @xmath279 must become particle - hole symmetric in this limit , this implies that @xmath292 vanishes at small @xmath293 .",
    "hence , taking a derivative with respect to temperature , of @xmath291 we find that @xmath294 .",
    "thus we finally obtain : @xmath295 where @xmath296 is given in eq.([relationq0theta ] ) . integrating this equation over @xmath94 ( taking into account as a boundary condition",
    "the value of @xmath297 obtained above ) , we finally derive the expression of the entropy : @xmath298\\ ] ] with , as above : @xmath299 . the expression ( [ entropycft ] )",

    "a plot of the residual entropy and of the asymmetry parameter @xmath181 as a function of @xmath94 is displayed on fig.[figentropie ] .",
    "@xmath300 is maximal at @xmath156 and vanishes as @xmath95 as expected .    in this section",
    ", we have discovered that the spectral asymmetry parameter ( `` twist '' ) @xmath181 shares a fairly simple relation with the residual entropy , given by eq.([ouf ] ) .",
    "these are two universal quantities , characteristic of the fixed - point .",
    "remarkably , @xmath181 also coincides with the term proportional to @xmath246 in @xmath128 ( while @xmath128 itself is non - universal , its linear term in @xmath246 is ) .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that a deeper interpretation of these facts is still to be found .",
    "the low - temperature behaviour of the internal energy in the large-@xmath4 limit can be obtained by two different methods .",
    "we shall briefly describe both since they emphasize different and complementary aspects of the physics .    in the first method , we use the effective action in the form ( [ action1 ] ) , _ before _ the decoupling with the auxiliary bosonic field @xmath99 is made .",
    "we thus have a quartic interaction vertex between the conduction electrons at the origin and the abrikosov fermions representing the quasiparticles in the spin sector , which reads : @xmath301 one can then perform a skeleton expansion of the free - energy functional in terms of the _ interacting _ green s functions for the pseudo - fermions and the conduction electrons , @xmath302 and @xmath303 . the first - order ( hartree ) contribution to this functional vanishes because the spin operator in ( [ kondoint ] ) is written in a traceless manner .",
    "the next contribution , at second order , yields the most singular contribution at low temperature and reads : @xmath304 at the saddle - point , the interacting conduction electron green s function is @xmath305 , and hence its dominant long - time behaviour is : @xmath306 . inserting this , together with @xmath307 in ( [ energ2opt ] ) , we see that the leading low - temperature behaviour to the energy reads @xmath308 , and hence to the specific heat coefficient : @xmath309 which agrees with the cft result described above .",
    "we note that there is a quite precise connection between this calculation and the cft approach : the operator appearing in the kondo interaction ( [ kondoint ] ) acquires conformal dimension @xmath310 and has the appropriate structure of the scalar product of a spin current with the operator @xmath311 ( transforming as the adjoint ) .",
    "therefore , it is the large-@xmath4 version of the leading irrelevant operator associated with the spin sector , as described in sec.[cftsec ] .",
    "it is satisfying that the leading low-@xmath246 behaviour comes from the second - order contribution of this operator in this formalism as well .",
    "we note that for the simple kondo model ( [ ham1 ] ) , in the scaling limit , the analogous irrelevant operator in the flavour sector _ does not _ show up in the calculation of the energy in the large - n solution .",
    "we shall comment further on this point below .",
    "the second method to investigate the internal energy is to push the low - temperature expansion of the free - energy to higher orders . to this end",
    ", we need to compute higher - order terms in the expansion ( [ scalg ] ) of the green s functions in the scaling regime .",
    "this computation is detailed in appendix [ detailcalcul].3 , and leads to : @xmath312 let us emphasize that the exponents appearing in this expansion _ are not symmetric between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom_. this is because we are dealing with the kondo model for which the auxiliary field ( bosonic ) propagator has no frequency dependence in the non - interacting theory .",
    "also , the expansion given in ( [ defsndfntechelle ] ) assumes a perfectly flat conduction band in the limit of an infinite bandwith ( conformal limit ) . using this expansion into the expression ( [ free ] ) of the free - energy leads to a specific heat coefficient : @xmath313 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath314 actually vanishes , so that the behavior in ( [ specific ] ) is recovered .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath314 was clear in the first approach , where it followed from the absence of hartree terms . in the cft approach , it is associated with the fact that the leading irrelevant operator does not contribute to the free energy at first order .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath314 implies non trivial sum rules relating the scaling functions @xmath154 and @xmath315 ( which we have not attempted to check explicitly ) .",
    "we also note that this behaviour of the specific heat is modified when an anderson model version of the present model is considered ( as in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "because the non - interacting slave boson propagator has a frequency dependence , the exponents of the second - order terms as written in ( [ defsndfntechelle ] ) are only correct for @xmath316 for the anderson model . for @xmath317 , the term @xmath318 is replaced by @xmath319 , while @xmath320 is replaced by @xmath321 . as a result , one finds a diverging specific heat coefficient _ in both cases _ , with @xmath322 for @xmath316 and @xmath323 for @xmath317 .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath317 is due to the leading irrelevant operator in the flavor sector .",
    "similarly , for @xmath317 in the anderson model , the susceptibility associated with the _ flavour ( channel ) sector _",
    "@xmath324 is found to diverge @xcite , so that a finite wilson ratio can still be defined as @xmath325 for @xmath317 .      in order to discuss transport properties ,",
    "we define a scattering t - matrix for the conduction electrons in the usual manner ( for a single impurity ) : @xmath326 where @xmath209 and @xmath327 denote the interacting and non - interacting conduction - electron green s functions , respectively . taking a flat particle - hole symmetric band for the conduction electron and denoting by @xmath328 the local non - interacting density of states , this yields the local conduction electron green s function in the form :    @xmath329    following ref.@xcite , we parametrize the zero - frequency limit of the t - matrix in terms of a scattering amplitude @xmath330 as : @xmath331 so that , the zero frequency electron green s function reads : @xmath332 @xmath333 corresponds to no scattering at all , while @xmath334 corresponds to maximal unitary scattering ( _ i.e _ @xmath335 phase shift and vanishing conduction electron density of states at the impurity site ) . in the overscreened case , as noted in @xcite",

    "thus , only @xmath353 can be extracted from the scaling limit , while @xmath354 requires a more sophisticated analysis .",

    "the large - n analysis of the overscreened regime @xmath388 is essentially identical to that presented in the present paper for antisymmetric representations .",
