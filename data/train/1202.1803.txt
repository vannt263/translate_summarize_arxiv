    "soon after the discovery of the luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , whose bolometric luminosities are dominated by the infrared part of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( @xmath27@xmath2810@xmath2l@xmath23 ) ( e.g. soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) , single dish and interferometric co j=10 , 21 line observations were used to determine their total molecular gas mass and its distribution ( sanders et al .",

    "these efforts were paralleled by several investigations of the so - called @xmath4=m(h@xmath29)/@xmath30(10 ) factor and its dependance on the average ism conditions both theoretical ( dickman et al . 1988 ; maloney & black 1988 ; wolfire et al . 1993 ; sakamoto 1996 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ; wall 2007 ) and observational ( e.g. israel 1988 , 1993 , 1997 ; solomon et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; yao et al .",
    "the average molecular gas conditions in lirgs used in such studies have been typically constrained using co(21)/(10 ) and co/@xmath20co j=10 , 21 line ratios ( e.g. braine & combes 1992 ; horellou et al 1995 ; aalto et al .",
    "1995 ; papadopoulos & seaquist 1998 ) . higher - j transitions ( j=32 and higher ) were used only sporadically and mostly for star - forming galactic nuclei ( e.g. devereux et al .",

    "; yao et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this was a result of the larger difficulties such observations pose in terms of available submm receivers , their sensitivity , and the dry weather conditions needed ( especially for @xmath31@xmath25460ghz , co j=43 ) .",
    "receiver sensitivity limitations also hindered large multi - j line surveys of the much fainter lines from heavy rotor molecules such as hcn that probe higher density gas ( @xmath3210@xmath14@xmath15 ) except in nearby galactic nuclei ( jackson et al .",
    "1995 ; paglione et al .",
    "1997 ) and a few luminous ulirgs ( e.g. gracia - carpio et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "such limitations will soon be overcome after the ongoing commissioning of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is completed",
    ". then routine multi - j observations of co and heavy rotor molecules will yield unhindered view over the entire range of physical conditions in molecular clouds , from their quiescent and low - density phase ( @xmath33@xmath34(10@xmath12 - 10@xmath35)@xmath15 , @xmath36@xmath8(10 - 15)k ) to the dense and warm gas intimately associated with star formation ( @xmath37@xmath38(10@xmath14 - 10@xmath39)@xmath15 , @xmath40@xmath38(30 - 150)k ) .",
    "the power of interferometric multi - j line imaging in revealing the mass distribution of dense warm sf gas in lirgs has already been demonstrated by pioneering sma observations ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 ; wilson et al . 2009 ; iono et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , while in the grand spiral m51 co line ratio imaging at high resolution revealed agn - excited gas in its nucleus ( iono et al .",
    "the influence of the high - excitation conditions found in sf regions gas on the @xmath4 in galaxies may not necessarily be strong since dense and warm sf gas amounts to only @xmath21(0.5 - 3)% of typical giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) mass .",
    "even smaller fractions of the total molecular gas in spirals disks resides in their centers ( @xmath21(0.1 - 1)% ) where strong tidal fields , high cosmic ray energy densities and/or agn can drive a high molecular line excitation .",
    "nevertheless this may no longer be true for the merger - driven starbursts in ulirgs where a dense sf gas phase can contain the bulk of their total molecular gas mass ( e.g. solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; gao & solomon 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , cases of agn - driven mechanical and radiative feedback affecting the bulk of the molecular gas of the host galaxy and the corresponding co sleds have now been identified ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2008 ; van der werf et al .",
    "these systems along with ulirgs , yield a nearby glimpse of ism conditions that could be prevelailing in the distant  universe .    in the present work we examine the influence of the average molecular gas conditions found in lirgs ( papadopoulos et al 2011 , hereafter paperi ) on the @xmath4 factor .",
    "we do so by using the largest combined database of lirgs / co transitions for which such a study has been conducted , while discussing also the limitations and potential biases of past theoretical and observational studies .",
    "we then outline methods that could be employed in the upcoming era of alma , and the special role the herschel space observatory ( hso ) can play , towards improved total molecular gas mass estimates , especially for ulirgs ( @xmath27@xmath32@xmath41@xmath42 ) . several such galaxies whose co line ratios indicate extreme ism conditions ( see paperi ) are now studied individualy , their impact on the @xmath4 values examined in detail . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath43-dominated cosmology with @xmath44=71kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 and @xmath45=0.27 .",
    "the formal dependance of the @xmath19 factor on the average density , temperature , and kinematic state of large molecular cloud ensembles ( where the statistical notion of @xmath4 remains applicable ) is explored in several papers ( e.g. dickman et al .",
    "1986 ; young & scoville 1991 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ; solomon et al . 1997 ; papadopoulos & seaquist 1999 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; yao et al .",
    "co and @xmath20co lines can yield constraints on these ism properties , and thus on the corresponding @xmath4 , via radiative transfer models ( e.g. mao et al .",
    "2000 ; weiss et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this regard low - j co sleds ( up to j=32 ) with @xmath46@xmath47(400@xmath1510@xmath48)@xmath15 and @xmath49@xmath47(5.533)k",
    "are adequate for determining the average state of the molecular gas and thus the appropriate @xmath4 , provided that most of its mass is distributed in ordinary gmcs .",
    "the low - j co sled segment and its modeling can then in principle yield the mass normalization for the entire co or of any other molecular line sled ( e.g. of hcn ) typically emanating from much smaller mass fractions . for several ulirgs in our sample",
    "whose co sleds will be extended up to j=1312 using the hso this normalization is especially important as it allows determining the mass of the highly - excited molecular gas emitting the very high - j lines , and setting important constraints on the energy source responsible for its excitation ( van der werf et al .",
    "2010 ; rangwala et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "there are currently only three major observational studies of @xmath50 using co lines for substantial lirg samples ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; yao et al .",
    "2003 ) . for the highly turbulent molecular gas in ( u)lirgs these typically find @xmath50=(1/101/3)@xmath51 , with the low values attributed mostly to non self - gravitating gas distributions . for sf spiral disks",
    "a @xmath52@xmath53(4 - 5)@xmath54=m@xmath23 ( kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 ] remains applicable as most of their molecular gas is found in cool , low - density , self - gravitating gmcs as those in the milky way , pockmarked by sf `` spots '' of warm and dense gas with also nearly galactic @xmath50 ( e.g. young & scoville 1991 ) . in isolated spirals",
    "low @xmath50@xmath21(1/201/5)@xmath51 values can be found only in their nuclei ( 2r@xmath56100200pc ) ( regan 2000 ) , but involve only small fractions of the total molecular gas reservoirs .",
    "thus for the metal - rich environments of lirgs current observational work points to a bimodal @xmath4 distribution , with near - galactic values for all isolated spiral disks , and @xmath57@xmath38(1/4 - 1/5)@xmath58@xmath59 in the merger - driven starbursts of ulirgs . this view has even been widely adopted even for high - z star - forming lirgs where only sparse sampling of their co sleds exists ( e.g greve et al .",
    "2005 ; tacconi et al . 2006 ; dannerbauer et al .",
    "it is worth noting that the claimed bimodality of the schmidt - kennicutt star formation relations ( linking sfr and molecular gas supply ) between disks and mergers ( daddi et al .",
    "2010a ; genzel et al .",
    "2010 ) is nearly equivalent to such an @xmath50 bimodality ( narayanan et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .    nevertheless much of the aforementioned observational work contains some serious methodological limitations borne out from the limited molecular line data available per object and specific assumptions made about the radiative transfer models .",
    "these are :    * setting @xmath60=@xmath61 in the co line radiative transfer models used to constrain @xmath19 even though photoelectric , turbulent , or cosmic - ray heating can easily induce @xmath60@xmath62@xmath61 . * using a constant dv / dr ( usually 1kms@xmath11pc@xmath11 ) in the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) radiative transfer models that interpret co line ratios even if : a ) virial gas motions alone correspond to @xmath218 - 10 times higher values for the dense gas ( @xmath63@xmath6410@xmath26@xmath15 ) that may be dominant in ulirgs , and b ) stellar mass concomitant with molecular gas and/or tidally - induced velocity fields can easily yield much larger dv / dr values . * the use of empirical relations and object - specific assumptions for obtaining @xmath4 expressions that can account for the potentially significant stellar mass concomitant with the molecular gas , an issue that arises especially in ulirgs . *",
    "the molecular lines used in such studies ( low - j co lines ) are insensitive to the properties of the gas with densities @xmath65@xmath3210@xmath35@xmath15 .",
    "the last two set the most serious methodological limitations on the very influential study of @xmath19 in ulirgs by downes & solomon 1998 ( herafter ds98 ) , whose results are widely used for presumably similar systems at high redshifts . in",
    "that study models of the co j=10 , 21 interferometric images of 5 ulirgs were used to deduce @xmath19@xmath21(1/5 - 1/6)@xmath59 , attributing these low values to a continous molecular gas distribution encompassing large fractions of stellar mass and thus velocity fields determined by the total ( gas)+(stellar ) mass ( see also downes et al . 1993 ; solomon et al .",
    "the use of empirical relations ( e.g. @xmath66=200@xmath67(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 ) , and setting a @xmath68=@xmath69@xmath210.5 mass ratio of newly formed stars ( @xmath70 ) to those in an old stellar bulge ( @xmath71 ) in the pre - merger spirals make the computed @xmath19 _ specific to the few ulirgs studied _ and certainly not automatically applicable to other ulirgs in the local or the distant universe . moreover `` freezing '' dv / dr to 1kms@xmath11pc@xmath11 renders such models incapable of constraining the average dynamical state of the gas and thus exploring its effect on @xmath4 in a straightforward  way ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , while the ds98 formalism can be generalized to arbitary @xmath72 values , it remains impractical for the dusty gas - rich systems at high redshifts where stellar populations are heavily dust - enshrouded .",
    "finally an @xmath19 factor deduced solely from co j=10 , 21 line emission models may be inapplicable for a much denser gas phase ( n(h@xmath29)@xmath6410@xmath48@xmath15 ) .",
    "this will yield a small error when such a phase represents only a few% of the total mass per typical gmc ( as is the case in spiral disks ) , but to a potentially much larger error if the dense gas dominates the molecular gas mass budget .",
    "these difficulties are compounded by setting dv / dr=1kms@xmath11pc@xmath11 , which while justified by the sole co(2 - 1)/(1 - 0 ) line ratio available in the ds98 study , may be partly responsible for the contradictory results obtained for the average gas density and co line excitation .",
    "indeed while hcn and high - j co observations indicate much of the gas in some ulirgs to be very dense ( @xmath37@xmath3210@xmath48@xmath15 ) , radiative transfer models of co j=10 and j=21 interferometric images of some of the same ulirgs ( e.g. arp220 ) become incompatible with these images already for n@xmath6410@xmath73@xmath15 ( ds98 ) .",
    "velocity gradients of @xmath74@xmath621kms@xmath11pc@xmath11 ( expected for the highly turbulent gas disks of ulirgs ) and high temperatures for the dense gas can much reduce line optical depths and the emergent co line emission possibly aleviating these  discrepancies .    in summary",
    "all current observational studies of @xmath4 in lirgs , leave its range and dependance on the average density , temperature and kinematic state of the molecular gas still largely unexplored .",
    "the small lirg / co line datasets used in such studies , and the aforementioned limitations of the analysis methods , limits their applicability to other such systems in the local or the distant universe .",
    "our dataset of total co lines luminosities for a substantial sample of lirgs provides a good opportunity for exploring the @xmath4 dependance on the average ism state in vigorously star - forming systems .",
    "the average dv / dr for the gas is now a free parameter to be constrained by lvg radiative transfer models along with the density and temperature .",
    "this provides an extinction - free and straightforward method for determining the effects of stellar mass concomitant with molecular gas and/or tidal disruption of molecular clouds on @xmath4 .    to place our discussion regarding molecular gas mass estimates in lirgs in an autonomous context we reproduce the @xmath19 factor ( see appendix ) as    @xmath75    where @xmath76=0.552.4 depending on the assumed cloud density profile ( see bryant & scoville 1996 , eqs a11 , a17 ) , and @xmath33 , @xmath77 are the average gas density and co j=10 brightness temperature of the molecular cloud ensemble .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 is given by    @xmath79}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\lambda _ { co}}\\left(\\frac{n(h_2)}{10 ^ 3\\ ,   cm^{-3}}\\right)^{-1/2},\\ ] ]    ( with @xmath80/(dv / dr$ ] being one of the outputs of a typical lvg model ) , and determines the average dynamic state of the molecular gas , with @xmath81@xmath3813 for the ( mostly ) self - gravitating gmcs in the galactic disk ( and @xmath78@xmath821 corresponding to dynamically unattainable gas motions ) . for a typical value of @xmath76=1.5 equation 1",
    "becomes    @xmath83    which we use in the present work . for ordinary gmcs with @xmath33@xmath38500@xmath15 , @xmath77@xmath2110k , and @xmath84@xmath381 - 2 the latter yields @xmath19@xmath21(3 - 6)@xmath85 ( where @xmath86=@xmath87(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 ) .",
    "the optically thin limit for co j=10 line emission is often adopted to provide a lower limit on the total molecular gas mass ( e.g. bryant & scoville 1996 ; solomon et al .",
    "the availability of several co lines allows a more robust such limit without assuming lte :    @xmath88 \\left(\\frac{m_{\\odot}}{k\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^2}\\right),\\ ] ]    ( see appendix ) , which makes obvious that , unless the co line ratios become significantly larger than unity ( which they can in optically thin emission ) , most of the contributions come from the low j levels .",
    "the lte expression is :    @xmath89    \\left(\\frac{m_{\\odot}}{k\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^2}\\right),\\ ] ]    which gives a higher ( and less reliable ) lower limit since the lte partition function can be significantly larger than the non - lte one .",
    "the optically thin approximation can be used also for the realistic case of significant co line optical depths as long as large velocity gradients keep the photon escape probability local throughout the bulk of the molecular gas mass .",
    "then equation 4 is modified to    @xmath90 \\nonumber   \\rm \\left(\\frac{m_{\\odot}}{k\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^2}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath91=@xmath92/\\tau_{j+1\\,j}$ ] is the photon escape probability ( see appendix ) .",
    "the last equation provides a more robust lower limit than equation 4 , as it accounts for finite line optical depths ( computed from radiative transfer models ) .",
    "if enough line ratios are available , the estimate from equation 6 will approach that of equation 3 as long as one average gas phase dominates the emergent co line emission .    in figure 1",
    "we show the @xmath4 and @xmath93(lte ) distributions , computed from equations 3 and 5 and the results of one radiative transfer models for the co sleds and @xmath20co lines for all the lirgs in our sample ( see paperi ) .",
    "most @xmath4 values are @xmath941.5@xmath54 , with @xmath95@xmath80.60@xmath96 obtained for the main distribution ( excluding the few outliers beyond 3@xmath54 ) .",
    "the @xmath97(lte ) distribution gives similar results , indicating that most of the states compatible with the co sleds have optically thin or moderately optically thick co j=10 line ( @xmath98@xmath3813 ) .",
    "this has been noted in the past in the context of a two - phase ism model and attributed to the high temperatures of a turbulent `` envelope '' phase in molecular clouds ( aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 range obtained using our one - phase models of global co sleds is similar to that reported by ds98 and yao et al .",
    "moreover in figure 2 the distribution of @xmath99 demonstrates that unlike often stated , the effects of density and temperature do not always cancel out but are responsible for much of the @xmath19 variations over different ism environments ( compare figure 2 , with the @xmath100 distribution in figure 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless the average dynamical state of the gas ( i.e. @xmath84 ) remains the most important factor affecting the average @xmath6 .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 where the @xmath19 distributions for virial / near - virial and unbound average gas dynamical states are shown . in the merger - driven starbursts of ulirgs highly non - virial gas velocities",
    "can be caused by significant amounts of stellar mass concomitant with a continous molecular gas distribution as noted by ds98 ( see also solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , albeit without using radiative transfer models to constrain @xmath78 .",
    "strong tidal fields acting on gmc cloud envelopes and/or a diffuse intercloud molecular gas distribution whose velcity field traces the combined potential of the surviving dense gmc cores as well as stars will both raise the average @xmath101 , and further reduce the corresponding @xmath4 ( equation  3 ) .    in figure 4 the distribution of @xmath102 computed from equation 6",
    "is shown which , unlike that deduced from equation 3 , uses the co line ratios explicitely .",
    "this makes it more suitable when fully - sampled co sleds from j=10 up to high - j ( e.g. j=65 , 76 ) are available , and when the turbulent models of the hierarchical density structures of molecular clouds ( e.g. ossenkopf 2002 ) become refined enough to provide global co and @xmath20co sleds as well as the corresponding @xmath103 values per density `` sub - phase '' . for well - sampled @xmath20co sleds the @xmath104 expression ( using the appropriate @xmath105 $ ] abundance )",
    "is even more useful as @xmath106(@xmath20co)@xmath211 . in our current study using the output @xmath107 values from our one - phase models in equation 6 yields an @xmath108 distribution similar to that of @xmath4 from equation 3 .",
    "interestingly the @xmath19 distributions , while concentrated within @xmath21(0.31.5)@xmath96 , do extend out to galactic values @xmath21(2.5 - 6)@xmath96 .",
    "these are found for disk - dominated lirgs ( e.g. ngc157 and mrk1048 ) , ( u)lirgs with unexpectedly `` cold '' co ratios ( e.g. iras05189 - 2524 ) where cool ( @xmath2115k ) gas with low / modest densities ( @xmath38(10@xmath1210@xmath35)@xmath15 ) dominates their average ism state .",
    "surprisingly , _",
    "galactic @xmath16 values can be found also in some ulirgs , _ whose `` hot '' co ratios ( e.g. iras08572 + 3915 ) indicate a dominant warm ( @xmath21(100150)k ) and dense ( @xmath21(3@xmath5810@xmath4810@xmath109)@xmath15 ) phase , or other evidence ( e.g. multi - j hcn lines ) suggest a massive dense , gas phase ( e.g. mrk231 ) .",
    "thus large @xmath19 values are possible for both high and low excitation gas phases and thus can not be used as indicators of galaxy - type ism conditions in distant star forming disks ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "this also suggests that in many local ulirgs and similar systems at high redshifts _ the widely adopted @xmath110@xmath38(0.8 - 1)@xmath111 values understimate their molecular gas mass .",
    "_      recent studies of sf feedback suggest a maximum @xmath112=@xmath113@xmath38500@xmath114 for the dense and warm gas @xmath115 near sf sites in galaxies as a result of strong radiation pressure from the nascent o , b star clusters onto the concomitant dust of the accreted gas fueling these sites ( scoville 2004 ; thompson et al . 2005 ; thompson 2009 ) .",
    "thus , provided that average dust properties ( e.g. its effective radiative absorption coefficient per unit mass ) remain similar in metal - rich star - forming systems such as lirgs , a near - constant @xmath112 is expected among them .",
    "a value of @xmath116@xmath21500@xmath117 is actually measured in individual sf sites of spiral disks such as m51 and entire starbursts such as arp220 ( scoville 2003 ) , while @xmath17(@xmath118)@xmath117 is obtained for cs - bright star - forming cores in the galaxy ( shirley et al .",
    "further evidence for a near - constant @xmath119 is the tight linear @xmath120-hcn(1 - 0 ) correlation found for individual gmcs up to entire ulirgs ( wu et al .",
    "2005 ) with hcn j=10 used as a dense gas mass tracer .",
    "however the intermitency expected for galaxy - sized molecular gas reservoirs ( i.e. at any given epoch of a galaxy s evolution some dense gas regions will be forming stars while others will not ) will lower the global @xmath121 to @xmath381/3 - 1/2 of the eddington value ( andrews & thompson  2011 ) .",
    "similar @xmath122 values can be obtained without explicit use of the eddington limit ( and the detailed dust properties it entails ) , but from the typical @xmath123 in young starbursts where @xmath70 is the mass of the new stars and @xmath124 their bolometric luminosity ( @xmath21@xmath125 for the deeply dust - enshrouded sf sites ) . for @xmath126=@xmath127 $ ] as the sf efficiency of the dense gas regions where the new stars form",

    "given that @xmath165 can very greatly among lirgs , it is instructive to also obtain @xmath159 in a lirg where the relative distributions of the warm sf versus the cold sf - idle gas are well known . for the sy2 ngc1068 : @xmath257@xmath212.7kpc and @xmath258@xmath386kpc ( papadopoulos & seaquist 1999 ) , while @xmath259@xmath385 .",
    "thus @xmath260@xmath530.79 and @xmath261@xmath530.6@xmath262 , which is @xmath383x higher than @xmath263 ( that would be deduced from its global co  sled ) .",
    "highly turbulent molecular gas in the merger - driven starbursts of ulirgs , and extended , cold , sf - quiescent gas in the disks of isolated or slightly perturbed lirgs represent the two extremes where current co line studies may systematically underestimate the total molecular gas mass . in both cases",
    "global co sleds often show a low - excitation component , seen as small co j=10 , 21 line flux `` excess '' ( often with a subthermal co ( 21)/(10 ) ratio ) on top of the dominant co line emission of a warm and dense sf gas phase with high co line excitation to much higher j levels . in ulirgs",
    "such a diffuse low - excitation phase is typically unbound , warm , and contains little mass . in the disks of lirgs",
    "it consists of sf - quiescent , gravitationally bound ( or nearly so ) , galaxy - type gmcs extending beyond a central starburst . in the latter case spatially resolving the co sleds and/or dust emission of the nuclear sf region versus the extended cold disk can yield proper molecular gas mass estimates not dominated by the ( usually ) low @xmath264 of the co - bright nuclear sf region . in practice co and @xmath20co j=10 , and j=21 imaging of those sf and sf - idle areas of lirgs is adequate to determine the nature of the residing ism ( sf : @xmath265@xmath211 , @xmath266@xmath23810 - 15 , sf - quiescent : @xmath267@xmath530.40.6 , @xmath268@xmath213 - 6 , the corresponding @xmath19 values , and the areas over which they apply .    in the upcoming era of alma such spatial separations of sf and non - sf ism in lirg disks along with estimates of the corresponding molecular line ratios and @xmath19 values will be straightfoward . for ulirgs",
    "though the low - density and the high density gas components can be concomitant or very closely associated , especially if the former is the outcome of the disruption of gmc outer layers .",
    "thus high resolution co observations , even with alma , may be unable to separate their distributions and their corresponding co line ratios , leaving their @xmath19 factors still uncertain .",
    "in such galaxies , with the bulk of the molecular gas mass at n@xmath2510@xmath48@xmath15 , observations of rotational transitions of heavy rotor molecules such as hcn are of paramount importance , even without spatial information .",
    "for example a high global hcn / co j=10 brightness temperature ratio of @xmath211/4 - 1/6 would immediately indicate an unsually high @xmath269 , contrasting the @xmath2110@xmath188 lower such ratio in disk gmcs .",
    "then multi - j observations of heavy rotor molecules can be used to determine the corresponding @xmath196 , @xmath142 factors and eventually @xmath270 .",
    "high resolution interferometric imaging of at least two rotational transitions of a heavy rotor molecule ( e.g. hcn j=10 , 32 ) along with at least one of its isotopologues ( e.g. h@xmath20cn j=10 ) remains an invaluable resource for better determining the distribution and mass of the dense gas in the compact disks of ulirgs .",
    "this can be achieved using radiative transfer models of the emergent hcn line emission as a function of position within these disks , as done earlier for the co j=10 , j=21 interferometric study by ds98 .",
    "the focus will now be on the dense gas where much of the molecular gas mass resides , while its all - important average dynamical state ( i.e. the @xmath78 ) will be determined as part of the modeling .",
    "imaging of the rare isotopologues can much reduce the radiative transfer modeling degeneracies affecting @xmath271 , and yield improved constraints on the dense gas surface densities @xmath272 of the gas disks in ulirgs .",
    "their total gas mass can then be determined from integrating the resulting @xmath273 over the best - fit disk models .    here",
    "we must note that any molecular line observations that involve the @xmath274 $ ] isotope ratio such as co/@xmath20co or hcn / h@xmath20cn , while necessary for reducing lvg modeling degeneracies and better constraining @xmath78 , they involve the additional assumption of the @xmath275 $ ] abundance ratio ( which we assumed to be 50 in our lvg models ) .",
    "the latter can be particularly uncertain in ulirgs where their large co/@xmath20co line ratios have also been attributed to a higher @xmath275 $ ] abundance than in spiral disks , a result of early starburst ages and/or accretion of relatively unprocessed ( by star - formation ) molecular gas ( henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) . if enhanced @xmath275 $ ] abundances are indeed the norm in ulirgs this will have the general effect of _ increasing the various x@xmath276 , x@xmath277 factors _ since the deduced @xmath78 values per gas phase can now be lower .",
    "this will be so simply because larger @xmath275 $ ] abundances rather than low co line optical depths ( and thus high @xmath78 , see equation 11 in paper 1 ) can be also responsible for the observed high co/@xmath20co line ratios in  ulirgs .      in ulirgs a massive , warm , and dense gas phase can have a luminous co sled that remains prominent up to very high - j rotational transitions . since j=10 , 21 transitions can have significant contributions from a low - excitation diffuse gas component containing small fraction of the total molecular gas mass , this leaves only j=32 and higher - j co lines as useful probes of the bulk of the molecular gas mass and its properties .",
    "the spire / fts aboard the hso can provide access to co lines from j=43 up to j=1312 for local luminous ulirgs ( e.g. van der werf et al .",
    "2010 ; rangwala et al .",
    "2011 ) and thus yield a critical dataset for obtaining better total molecular gas mass estimates in such systems .",
    "once a fully - sampled global co sled from j=10 up to j=1312 is available , a multi - component analysis can decompose it into a series of gas components , constraining their properties , and using them to obtain the corresponding @xmath19 factors .",
    "such multi - phase models could eventually be produced by theoretical advancements in gmc - sized numerical simulations ( see 3.1.1 ) .",
    "thus hso observations of high - j co lines will allow better inventories of molecular gas mass in ulirgs since much of that mass resides in a dense , and presumably sf and warm phase .",
    "we note however that serious degeneracies will remain , especially regarding the all - important dynamical state of each gas component upon which the corresponding @xmath19 factor strongly depends .",
    "multi - j observations of the much fainter ( especially in ulirgs ) @xmath20co isotopologue lines , necessarily using the much larger mm / submm telescopes available from the ground ( and thus limited by the atmosphere up to j=65 , 76 ) are important for reducing those degeneracies , and better constraining @xmath78 , or equivalently ( for a given density and temperature ) , the escape probabilities @xmath278 per gas component that enter the expressions of the @xmath4 factors ( equations 3 and 6 ) .",
    "several ( u)lirgs in our sample merit an individual study either because a larger than average number of available co lines permits it ( see table 7 in paperi ) , and/or because very high line excitation make their co sleds irreducible to superpositions of star - forming and ( non - sf ) molecular gas ( see also paperi for a discussion on the implication about ism power sources ) .",
    "finally there are lirgs whose global co(j+1-j)/(1 - 0 ) ratios suggest the cold sf - quiescent clouds found at large galactocentric distances in the galaxy and the disk of m31 .",
    "such globally `` cold '' yet star - forming galaxies are very few , as expected for an ir - selected ( and thus sfr - selected ) lirg sample , and thus also deserve a closer look as they represent the low - excitation range in lirgs .",
    "the detailed model(s ) per galaxy and the associated discussion are in the appendix , while here we summarize the most important  findings .    the extreme range of co sleds found for the molecular gas reservoirs of lirgs discussed in paperi is now marked by individual objects . on the high end",
    "are galaxies like iras00057 + 4021 , arp299 , iras12112 + 305 and others whose extremely high co line excitation implies large amounts of very dense ( @xmath53(1 - 3)@xmath179(10@xmath48 - 10@xmath109)@xmath15 _ and _ ( often ) very warm ( @xmath40@xmath280100k ) gas .",
    "the large @xmath281=m(n@xmath2810@xmath48@xmath15)/m@xmath282(h@xmath29 ) deduced for such ( u)lirgs independently recovers , using mid / high - j co lines , a well - known result for merger - driven starbursts obtained using the hcn / co j=10 ratio as an @xmath283 proxy ( gao & solomon 2004 ) . these earlier studies ( see also gracia - carpio et al .",
    "2008 ; krips et al . 2008 ) found @xmath3810 times higher dense gas mass fractions in ulirgs than in isolated spirals .",
    "isofar as the dense molecular gas phase closely tracks the dense and warm gas associated with sf sites , the mid - j / high - j co lines of ulirgs are also expected to show clear indications of a high @xmath284 , as it is indeed found , and quite unlike what is expected from typical gmcs ( @xmath285@xmath210.02 - 0.03 ) .    furthermore , the very warm and strongly unbound ( @xmath84@xmath1320 ) states uncovered for the massive dense gas reservoirs of some lirgs can make their global co sleds surpass even those expected for sf `` hot''-spots in the orion a and b clouds . while in some distinct cases this can be due to strong agn feedback ( e.g. mrk231 ) , for all other galaxies with such extreme ism conditions ( e.g. iras00057 + 4021 , iras08572 + 3915 , iras23365 + 3604 )",
    "the cause is unclear .",
    "it remains to be explored whether the much higher sfr _ densities _ of the compact sf regions of ulirgs ( e.g. sakamoto et al . 2008 ) can create such extraordinary ism states where turbulence - injection by snrs no longer remains confined in small regions but encompasses much more molecular gas mass ( see discussion in paperi ) .",
    "this , along with crs ( also snr - generated ) may set up powerful global mechanisms that can volumetrically heat large amounts of gas , unhindered by the large dust extinctions and high average gas densities that will keep pdrs very localized around sf  sites",
    ".    on the low excitation end only a few cases of low global co line ratios are found ( e.g. iras051892524 , iras03359 + 1523 ) .",
    "this is expected for ir - selected ( and thus sfr - selected ) galaxies ( see dunne et al .",
    "2000 on the limitations of such samples in finding ( cold - ism)-dominated systems ) . in arp193 a low - excitation ism state and the lack of large amounts of dense and warm gas",
    "is actually suggested by hcn rather than co lines .",
    "indeed despite the presence of a young merger with substantial ir luminosity and a significant hcn / co j=10 line ratio , its global hcn line emission is consistent with the absence of a dense gas phase , possibly a case of strong sf feedback momentarily dispersing its dense gas supply ( papadopoulos 2007 ) .",
    "such ir - luminous/(dense - gas)-deficient galaxies will be rare ( see discussion in b.17 ) and thus valuable for studying the effects of sf feedback onto the dense ism where the initial conditions of star formation are set .",
    "the case of iras051892524 on the other hand stands out as one where a massive cold molecular gas - rich disk is implied but unlike other lirgs ( e.g. izw1 ) there are no morphological indications whatsover for the presence of such a disk in this very compact ulirg / agn system",
    ". moreover its `` warm '' co(6 - 5)/(3 - 2 ) ratio , warm ir `` colors '' , and compact size in cm , near - ir , and optical wavelengths would argue for the presence of only a warm , dense , sf gas phase , and thus this object represents a cautionary tale about such conclusions drawn for similar high - z ulirg / agn systems using only high - j co lines ( e.g. tacconi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we note that massive cold molecular gas disks are implied for other lirgs as well ( e.g. izw1 , viizw031 , ngc7469 ) but without strongly affecting their global co sleds or co/@xmath20co line ratios which remains dominated by the warm sf phase .",
    "this simply mirrors , for molecular lines , a result well - known for dust continuum emission , though in practice global co sleds are somewhat more sensitive to the presence of cold diffuse gas than the global dust seds are to the concomitant cold dust mass ( papadopoulos & allen  2000 ) .      in table 1",
    "we tabulate the total molecular gas mass estimates as produced by equations 3 , 10 , the corresponding @xmath4 factors , the minimum molecular gas mass implied for eddington - limited star formation ( section  2.3 ) , and the mass of the high - excitation ( h)-phase when a 2-component model is used to interpret the co , @xmath20co lines ( see appendix ) . a mere inspection of the third column demonstrates than in several galaxies ( @xmath5340% ) _ significantly larger @xmath16 factors than the so - called ( u)lirg values of @xmath21(0.6 - 1)@xmath111 may apply . _ for ulirgs",
    "this is due to large and even dominant fractions of their molecular gas mass being at much higher densities than in disk - dominated lirgs while for the latter because extended cold molecular disks ( with a galactic @xmath19 ) can contain much of the molecular gas mass while remaining incospicious in the global co sleds used to constrain the global @xmath4 . for ulirgs this low - mass bias includes some",
    "very well - known systems such as mrk231 and arp220 . for lower ir luminosity galaxies underestimates of their total molecular gas by the @xmath4 deduced from one - phase radiative transfer models of their co sleds can be important in disk - dominated systems ( e.g. ngc7469 ) , but also in seemingly compact star - forming galaxies that nevertheless have `` cold '' co sleds and galactic @xmath4 values ( iras051892524 ) .",
    "the computed @xmath235 and @xmath286 in table1 also make clear that in the case of ulirgs global molecular line sleds can reveal the aforementioned mass bias , provided that they include mid / high - j co and/or heavy rotor molecular lines ( e.g. hcn ) . for less ir - luminous galaxies with nuclear starbursts and cold sf - quiescent gas - rich disks global sleds can not easily identify the presence of the latter except in a few cases ( e.g. iras05189 - 2524 ) .",
    "this becomes possible only when additional spatial information ( e.g. co 1 - 0 , submm dust continuum , or cm imaging ) is available for such a disk ( e.g. ngc7469 ) . in the absence of such information even good one - phase models of global co sleds for a ( starburst)+(cold disk ) system may be unable to reveal the disk component leaving the deduced average @xmath100 dominated by the starburst phase ( e.g. iras02483 + 4302 ) . in the era of alma routine",
    "co multi - j and @xmath20co line imaging will provide much better molecular gas mass estimates for disk - dominated lirgs with strong ism excitation gradients ( see 3.4 ) .",
    "for ulirgs on the other hand multi - j observations of heavy rotor molecules ( e.g. hcn , cs ) and their rare isotopologues are necessary for confirming the high total @xmath4 and molecular gas masses implied by our results in table 1 , by constraining the all - important dynamic state of the massive dense gas phase as discused in 3.2.1 .",
    "in this work our large co , @xmath20co line survey of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) detailed in paperi ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2011 ) is used to examine the impact of the wide range of average ism conditions found for these galaxies on their total molecular gas mass estimates via the so - called @xmath19=m(h@xmath29)/@xmath287 factor .",
    "our sample includes some of the most prominent local ulirgs ( e.g. arp220 , mrk231 , iras172080014 ) , often used as templates for merger - driven starbursts at high redshifts , as well as less ir luminous disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "we find that one - phase radiative transfer models of the global co , @xmath20co line ratios yield @xmath288@xmath289(0.6@xmath2900.2)m@xmath23(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 , similar to that obtained by past studies .",
    "the average gas temperature and density strongly influence @xmath4 , but the gas average dynamical state is the most important influencing factor with unbound gas corresponding to low @xmath4 values while self - gravitating gas to higher ones .    nevertheless higher @xmath291@xmath8(2 - 6)m@xmath23(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 values are deduced for ( u)lirgs whenever adequate molecular line data exist to determine the mass contribution of gas at densities n@xmath2810@xmath48@xmath15 ( high - j co lines from our survey and/or hcn lines from the literature ) .",
    "theoretical expectations for the highly turbulent molecular gas in the merger - induced starbursts of ulirgs indicate that , with most of the gas at such high densities , the aforementioned large @xmath4 values maybe the rule rather than the exception in such systems .",
    "past observational studies were unable to determine this , yielding instead much lower @xmath19 values ( and often considered as ulirg - appropriate standard ones ) , because the molecular lines used ( mostly co j=10 , 21 ) could not constrain the properties of the dominant ( i.e. the dense ) gas phase in ulirgs .",
    "our results indicate that only high - j co lines and multi - j observations of heavy rotor molecules ( e.g. hcn , cs ) can overcome this mass bias , placing the herschel space observatory and alma front and center in the quest for improved molecular gas mass estimates in ulirgs in the local and the distant universe .",
    "of particular importance are good constraints on the dynamical state of the dense molecular gas in such systems ( self - gravitating or not ? ) since strongly unbound states for this phase seem to be the only possible way that @xmath4 in ulirgs could be much lower than a galactic value .",
    "observations of high - density tracing rare isotopologues ( e.g. high - j @xmath20co , h@xmath20cn ) will be of crucial importance in yielding such constraints .",
    "on the theoretical front , gmc - sized numerical simulations of the turbulent molecular gas with ulirg - type of boundary conditions are needed in order to obtain the dense gas mass fraction and its temporal evolution .",
    "this in turn can inform galaxy - sized simulations of merger systems which recently have included molecular gas , but can not track the dynamical state and mass of the dense gas .",
    "we also find lirgs where underestimates of their total molecular gas are the result of a massive , cold , gas - rich , disk existing beyond their central starburst .",
    "in such cases the global co sled , and the @xmath19 factor determined from it , remains dominated by the central starburst and its often low @xmath4 .",
    "spatially resolving the co , @xmath20co line and dust continuum emission of such disks in lirgs with strong ism excitation gradients is indispensible in accounting for their total molecular gas mass . in such cases ,",
    "provided that adequate resolution is employed to separate the cold gas disk from the nuclear starburst , even low - j co and @xmath20co lines ( j=10 , 21 , 32 ) are adequate to yield much improved molecular gas mass  estimates .",
    "finally our study unfolds the wide range of the global co sleds of lirgs presented in paperi over a subsample of individual systems .",
    "we find galaxies whose extreme co sleds indicate ism conditions that surpass those expected for star - forming regions and suggest ism energy sources other than photons from pdrs ( as already discussed in paperi ) . these can be agn , extreme turbulence , and/or very large cosmic ray energy densities .",
    "moreover we find lirgs where extreme sf feedback may have momentarily fully disrupted their dense molecular gas reservoirs , and lirgs where large amounts of cold sf - quiescent molecular gas are present despite the absence of an extended disk , their compact near - ir / cm emission size , and `` warm '' co ( 6 - 5)/(3 - 2 ) ratios",
    ". the latter type of objects can be particularly worrying if encountered at high redshifts where such characteristics can readily lead towards large underestimates of their total molecular gas mass .",
    "the wide range of the average ism conditions and the intriguing possibilities that may lie behind it , make our subsample of individually - studied lirgs an excellent target for future alma and noema ( for the northern objects ) molecular line imaging observations leading towards a complete picture about ism energetics , agn and sf feedback on the molecular gas in galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank the referee santiago burillo for his comments , and particularly for bringing into our attention two important issues namely , the uncertainties of [ co/@xmath20co ] abundance ratio in ulirgs , and the reliability of dynamical mass estimates , which resulted in our corresponding clarifications included in this paper .",
    "padelis p. papadopoulos would like to dedicate this long - coming work to his 10-month old son @xmath292-@xmath293 , for late night inspirations , and to his wife @xmath294 for her enduring support .",

    "<S> in this work we conclude the analysis of our co line survey of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : @xmath0@xmath110@xmath2l@xmath3 ) in the local universe ( paperi ) , by focusing on the influence of their average ism properties on the total molecular gas mass estimates via the so - called @xmath4=@xmath5 factor . </S>",
    "<S> one - phase radiative transfer models of the global co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) yield an @xmath6 distribution with : @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 over a significant range of average gas densities , temperatures and dynamical states . </S>",
    "<S> the latter emerges as the most important parameter in determining @xmath4 , with unbound states yielding low values and self - gravitating states the highest ones . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless in many ( u)lirgs where available higher - j co lines ( j=32 , 43 , and/or j=65 ) or hcn line data from the literature allow a separate assesment of the gas mass at high densities ( @xmath1310@xmath14@xmath15 ) rather than a simple one - phase analysis we find that _ near - galactic @xmath16@xmath17(3 - 6)@xmath18(kkms@xmath11pc@xmath12)@xmath11 values become possible . </S>",
    "<S> _ we further show that in the highly turbulent molecular gas in ulirgs a high - density component will be common and can be massive enough for its high @xmath4 to dominate the average value for the entire galaxy . using solely low - j co lines to constrain @xmath6 in such environments ( as it has been the practice up to now ) </S>",
    "<S> may have thus resulted to _ </S>",
    "<S> systematic underestimates of molecular gas mass in ulirgs _ as such lines are dominated by a warm , diffuse and unbound gas phase with low @xmath4 but very little mass . </S>",
    "<S> only well - sampled high - j co sleds ( j=32 and higher ) and/or multi - j observations of heavy rotor molecules ( e.g. hcn ) can circumvent such a bias , and the latter type of observations may have actually provided early evidence of it in local ulirgs . the only way that the global @xmath19 of such systems could be significantly lower than galactic is if the average dynamic state of the dense gas is strongly gravitationally unbound . </S>",
    "<S> this is an unlikely possibility that must be nevertheless examined , with lines of rare isotopologues of high gas density tracers ( e.g. h@xmath20cn , high - j @xmath20co lines ) being very valuable in yielding ( along with the lines of the main isotopes ) such constraints . for less ir luminous , disk - dominated systems , we find that the galaxy - averaged @xmath4 deduced by one - phase models of global sleds can also underestimate the total molecular gas mass when much of it lies in a sf - quiescent phase extending beyond a central star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> this is because such a phase ( and its large @xmath6 ) remain inconspicious in global co sleds . </S>",
    "<S> finally detailed studies of a subsample of galaxies finds ulirgs with large amounts ( @xmath2110@xmath22m@xmath23 ) of very warm ( @xmath24100k ) _ and _ dense gas ( @xmath2510@xmath26@xmath15 ) that could represent a serious challenge to photon - dominated regions as the main energy portals in the molecular ism of such systems . </S>"
