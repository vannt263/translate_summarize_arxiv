    "communication is subject to quantum mechanical indeterminism even when the transmitted information is entirely classical .",
    "this potentially counter - intuitive property results from the fact that information must be conveyed through a physical medium a _ communication channel_ that is unavoidably governed by quantum mechanics . from this perspective , the _ sender _ encodes information by preparing the channel into a well - defined quantum state , @xmath0 , selected from a predetermined alphabet , @xmath1 , of codewords .",
    "the _ receiver _ , following any relevant signal propagation , performs a measurement on the channel to ascertain which state was transmitted by the sender .",
    "a quantum mechanical complication arises when the states in @xmath2 are not orthogonal , as no measurement can distinguish between overlapping quantum states without some ambiguity @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty in determining the channel state translates into a non - zero probability that the receiver will misinterpret the transmitted codeword and produce a communication error . while it would seem obvious that the sender should simply adopt an alphabet of orthogonal states , it is rarely practicable to communicate under such ideal conditions @xcite",
    ". even when it is possible for the sender to transmit orthogonal codewords , inevitable imperfections in the channel including decoherence and energy dissipation quickly damage that orthogonality . in some cases , the classical information capacity of a noisy channel is actually maximized by a nonorthogonal alphabet @xcite .    when developing a communication system to operate at the highest feasible rate given fixed channel properties and a constrained capability for state preparation , the objective is to minimize the communication error by designing a `` good '' receiver .",
    "distinguishing between nonorthogonal states is a pervasive problem in quantum information theory @xcite addressed mathematically by optimizing a state - determining measurement over all positive operator valued measures ( povms ) @xcite .",
    "this general approach can be applied to communication ; however , arbitrary povms are rarely straightforward to implement in the laboratory .",
    "therefore , a `` good '' receiver must balance quantum mechanical optimality with implementability and robust performance under realistic experimental conditions .",
    "for example , the optical field produced by a laser provides a convenient quantum system for carrying information .",
    "of course , optical coherent states are not orthogonal and can not be distinguished perfectly by photodetection .",
    "while the overlap between different coherent states can be reduced by employing large amplitudes , power limitations often restrict @xmath2 to the small - amplitude regime where quantum effects dominate .",
    "this is especially true in situations ( such as optical fibers ) where the communication medium behaves nonlinearly at high power , as well as for long distance communication where signals are substantially attenuated , including deep space transmission .",
    "motivated by these experimental considerations , optimizing a communication process based on small - amplitude optical coherent states and photodetection has been an active subject since the advent of the laser @xcite .",
    "kennedy initially proposed a receiver based on simple photon counting to distinguish between two different coherent states @xcite .",
    "however , the kennedy receiver error probability lies above the quantum mechanical minimum @xcite ( or helstrom bound ) and this prompted dolinar to devise a measurement scheme capable of achieving the quantum limit @xcite .",
    "dolinar s receiver , while still based on photon counting , approximates an optimal povm by adding a local feedback signal to the channel ; but , this procedure has often been deemed impractical @xcite due to the need for real - time adjustment of the local signal following each photon arrival . as a result ,",
    "sasaki and hirota later proposed an alternative receiver that applies an open - loop unitary transformation to the incoming coherent state signals to render them more distinguishable by simple photon counting @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental advances in real - time quantum - limited feedback control @xcite suggest that the dolinar receiver may be more experimentally practical than previously believed .",
    "the opinion that feedback should be avoided in designing an optical receiver is grounded in the now - antiquated premise that real - time adaptive quantum measurements are technologically inaccessible .",
    "most arguments in favor of passive devices have been based on idealized receiver models that assume , for example , perfect photon counting efficiency .",
    "a fair comparison between open and closed - loop receivers should take detection error into account feedback generally increases the robustness of the measurement device in exchange for the added complexity .    here",
    ", we consider the relative performance of the kennedy , dolinar and sasaki - hirota receivers under _ realistic _ experimental conditions that include : ( 1 ) sub - unity quantum efficiency , where it is possible for the detector miscount incoming photons , ( 2 ) non - zero dark - counts , where the detector can register photons even in the absence of a signal , ( 3 ) non - zero dead - time , or finite detector recovery time after registering a photon arrival , ( 4 ) finite bandwidth of any signal processing necessary to implement the detector , and ( 5 ) fluctuations in the phase of the incoming optical signal .",

    "that is , the optical modulators used to adjust the phase and amplitude of the feedback signal as well as the digital signal processing technology necessary @xcite for implementing all real - time computations display finite bandwidths .",

    "[ figure::realisticscaling ] compares the error probabilities for the three receivers with the additional detector and feedback non - idealities taken into account .",
    "based on the performance data of the perkin - elmer spcm - aqr-13 si apd single photon counting module , we assumed a maximum count rate of @xmath167 photons / s , a detector dead - time of 50 ns , a dark count rate of 250 clicks / s and an after - pulsing probability of 1% . for the dolinar receiver , it was assumed that there was a 100 ns feedback delay resulting from a combination of digital processing time and amplitude / phase modulator bandwidth .",
    "the data points in fig.[figure::realisticscaling ] correspond to the error probabilities generated from 10,000 monte carlo simulations with @xmath161 .",
    "the lower dotted line indicates the appropriate helstrom bound as a function of the mean photon number , @xmath11 , for a detector with quantum efficiency , @xmath168 , and the upper curve indicates the analogous kennedy receiver error .",
    "evidentally , technical imperfections can have a large negative effect on the performance of passive detection protocols like the kennedy and sasaki - hirota receivers while the dolinar receiver is more robust .    ]",
    "unlike open - loop procedures , however , the feedback nature of the dolinar receiver additionally requires precise knowledge of the incoming signal phase , @xmath8 , so that @xmath169 can be properly applied .",
    "fluctuations in the index of refraction of the communication medium generally lead to some degree of phase noise in the incoming signal , @xmath85 . adequately setting the phase of @xmath170",
    "necessarily requires that some light from the channel be used for phase - locking the local oscillator a task that reduces the data transmission bandwidth .",
    "therefore , operating a communication system based on the dolinar receiver at the highest feasible rate requires that the number of photons diverted from the data stream to track phase variations in the channel be minimized .",
    "this optimization in turn requires knowledge of how signal phase noise propagates into the receiver error probability .",
    "figure [ figure::phaseerror ] shows the error probability , @xmath171 as a function of the phase difference , @xmath172 , between the incoming signal and the local oscillator .",
    "data points correspond to results from 10,000 monte carlo simulations per photon number and phase angle , and the solid curves reflect numerical fits to the monte carlo points .",
    "an exact comparison between the open - loop and dolinar receivers requires information regarding the specific phase - error density function for the actual communication channel being utilized .",
    "however , we do note that at @xmath165 photon , the phase of the local oscillator could be as large as @xmath173 before its error probability increased to that of the kennedy receiver .",
    "additionally , it appears that the slope of @xmath171 is zero at @xmath174 which implies that the dolinar receiver conveniently displays minimal sensitivity to small phase fluctuations in the channel .",
    "the dolinar receiver was found to be robust to the types of detector imperfections likely to exist in any real implementation of a binary communication scheme based on optical coherent state signaling and photon counting .",
    "this robustness seemingly results from the fact that the dolinar receiver can correct itself after events that cause an open - loop receiver to irreversibly misdiagnose the transmitted state .",
    "for example , imperfect detection efficiency introduces a failure mode where the probability , @xmath175 , is increased above the value set by quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations .",
    "however , the optimal structure of the dolinar receiver feedback insures that it still achieves the quantum mechanical minimum because it has control over the counting rate .",
    "that is , if the dolinar receiver selects the wrong hypothesis at some intermediate time , @xmath176 , the structure of the feedback insures that the receiver achieves the highest allowable probability for invalidating that incorrect decision during the remainder of the measurement , @xmath177 .    in the opposite situation ,",
    "where dark counts or background light produce detector clicks when there is no signal light in the channel , open - loop receivers will decide in favor of @xmath25 without any possibility for self - correction .",
    "this type of error leads to an irreparable open - loop increase in @xmath178 .",
    "but , the dolinar receiver has the potential to identify and fix such a mistake since selecting the wrong hypothesis at intermediate times increases the probability that a future click will invalidate the incorrect decision .",
    "when background light is present , poor phase coherence between stray optical fields and the signal provides no enhanced open - loop discrimination as there is no local oscillator to establish a phase reference ; a received photon is a received photon ( assuming that any spectral filtering failed to prevent the light from hitting the detector ) .",
    "the dolinar receiver is better immune to such an error since since incoherent addition of the stray field to the local oscillator will generally reduce the likelihood of a detector click , and even if so , that click will be inconsistent with the anticipated counting statistics .    despite the previous belief that the dolinar receiver is experimentally impractical due to its need for real - time feedback",
    ", we have shown that it is rather attractive for experimental implementation .",
    "particularly , quantum efficiency scales out of a comparison between the dolinar receiver error and the helstrom bound , while this is not the case for known unitary rotation protocols .",
    "these results strongly suggest that real - time feedback , previously cited as the dolinar receiver s primary drawback , in fact offers substantial robustness to many common imperfections that would be present in a realistic experimental implementation .",
    "most importantly , simulations under these realistic conditions suggest that the dolinar receiver can out - perform the kennedy receiver with currently available experimental technology , making it a viable option for small - amplitude , minimum - error optical communication .",
