    "some other experiments have been proposed or are still under construction @xcite .",
    "standard mri modes will not grow unless both the rotation period and the alfvn crossing time are shorter than the timescale for magnetic diffusion .",
    "this requires that both the magnetic reynolds number @xmath3 ( see definitions of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in fig .  [ princeton_full_scheme ] and their values in table .",

    "recent linear analyses have shown that mri - like mode could grow with much reduced magnetic reynolds number and lundquist number in the presence of a helical background magnetic field @xcite , at least for cylinders of infinite or periodic axial extent ( liu et al 2006b ) .",
    "the simulations of this paper , however , are limited to axial background fields    the experiment is complicated by the large ( @xmath16 ) reynolds number and by ekman circulation and stewartson layers @xcite , even though the princeton mri experimental apparatus has been constructed to minimize the circulation by the use of independently controlled split endcaps @xcite .",

    "the nature of saturation of mri in a couette flow is essentially different from accretion disks , in which mri is believed to saturate by turbulent reconnection @xcite . in accretion disks ,",
    "differential rotation arises from a balance between the gravitational attraction of the accreting body and centrifugal force .",
    "thermal and turbulent energies are probably small compared to orbital ones , so saturation is not likely to occur by modification of the mean flow profile . in experiments , however , differential rotation is imposed by viscous or other weak forces , so that mildly nonlinear mri might well change the mean rotation profile .    this paper is the second of a series , following @xcite .",
    "several idealizations made in that paper , notably the vertically periodic boundary conditions , are dispensed with here .",
    "we discuss the linear phase and nonlinear saturation of mri in finite cylinders with realistic fluid and magnetic boundary conditions .",

    "they are split into two sets of three in parallel , with the upper three in series and the bottom three also in series .",
    "currents @xmath26 were adjusted according to the experimental values . note that in the simulations the magnetic diffusivity @xmath5 is fixed to the experimental value @xmath27 ( table.[ta_parameter ] ) , however the kinematic viscosity is varied for the purpose of extrapolation from numerically tractable to experimentally realistic reynolds numbers .",
    "the measured current waveform is displayed in fig .",
    "[ experiment_coil ] for target currents of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the waveform displayed has an overshoot at the early stage , a linear decline and then a linear ramp where the controller tries to adjust the output voltage to reach the programmed set point .",
    "this behavior is peculiar to the high current runs ( left panel of fig .",

    "since the container is made of stainless steel , not a perfectly insulator , the radial magnetic angular momentum flux ( @xmath31 ) at the cylinders need not vanish . in principle , the magnetic coupling of the fluid to the cylinders might modify the growth of the instability@xcite .    fortunately , at the frequencies relevant to princeton mri experiment ( 100% run , @xmath32 ) the skin depth of stainless steel @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the conductivity of stainless steel , see the value in table .",
    "[ ta_parameter ] ) , which is much larger than the thickness of the steel vessel surrounding the gallium in the experiment , @xmath35 , so that the magnetic field diffuses rather easily into the boundary .",
    "if one considers axial currents , the gallium and the steel wall act as resistors in parallel ; taking into account their conductivities and radial thicknesses , one finds that the resistances of steel walls are much larger than the resistance of the liquid gallium [ @xmath36 ; see fig .",
    "[ princeton_full_scheme ] for the subscripts ] .",
    "therefore , the currents carried by the steel walls can be neglected for the toroidal field , so that the @xmath37 stress at the boundary is expected to be unimportant and an insulating boundary condition suffices .",
    "the linear growth rate and saturated final state based on partially conducting boundary condition differs slightly from the results based on perfectly insulating boundary condition with partially conducting walls , which verifies our argument .",
    "hereafter we ignore the conductivity of the stainless steel walls , but regard them as insulating materials , that is : @xmath38 .",

    "this is the desired basic state for mri to grow .",
    "however , the experimental scans find that only if we choose @xmath39=[400,53,146,40]\\;{\\rm rpm}$ ] ( 10% run , @xmath44 ) , the bulk flow profile is found to be very close to the ideal couette state with the deviation ( the boundary layer ) highly confined near both endcaps @xcite .",
    "@xcite also shows that non - magnetic quasi - keplerian flows at reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady , if the boundary effects have been properly considered .",
    "the stewartson layer at the junction of the rings may be smoothed by localized circulation and/or turbulence from these instabilities @xcite .",
    "the rotation profile to be used in the magnetized runs would be @xmath39=[2400,320,876,240]\\;{\\rm rpm}$ ] ( 60% run , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the difference of the rotation profile at the end caps between in the experiment and in the simulation could possibly be explained by the wobbling of the inner cylinder in the experimental runs due to the difficulties of aligning the inner cylinder perfectly and the gaps between the rings and cylinders @xcite . and these effects",
    "are speculated to be more important with higher reynolds number @xmath45 as in the experiment .",
    "unfortunately , the modern computers and codes can not afford a simulation with reynolds number as high as several million .",
    "although this is not experimentally realizable , the low - reynolds - number results reported in this paper without wobbling , gaps and starting from an initially ideal couette state with fully insulating magnetic boundary conditions still gives us some useful hints about what is going on in the experiment .",
    "the result maybe is even closer to what is happening in the experiment based on the purely hydrodynamic experiment ( steady flow , mostly ideal couette state in the bulk ) , although this argument needs to be proven .",
    "we are addressing the problem step by step , adding the complexity into the code one by one . to include all subtle points at one time would perplex the problem and make it difficult for us to catch the essence of the problem .",
    "the detailed study of the influence of the wobbling and gaps between the rings is on the way to investigate the discrepancies between the experimental results and simulations .",
    "also we want to point out : as demonstrated by @xcite , the viscosity of liquid metals is so small as to be almost irrelevant to mri , at least in the linear regime .",
    "thus a low - reynolds - number run would be fine , at least in this sense .",
    "most of results presented in this paper are the results of 100% run except stated explicitly .",
    "the simulation results have proved very valuable in design , operation and understanding of the experiment .",

    "the results of the nonlinear saturation of mri are discussed in sec .",

    "[ summary ] summarizes the results and presents the final conclusions .",
    "the first convincing evidence of the existence of mri is its linear growth rate ( fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_br_outside ] ) . we find this linear growth rate is reduced from @xmath46 with ideal couette state at both endcaps ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_br_outside ] , the end effect is removed completely by enforcing ideal couette state at both endcaps , thus no ekman circulation is present ) to @xmath47 with two rings just as in the real experiment ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_br_outside ] ) .",
    "this is due to the residual magnetic ekman circulation , which modifies the background flow .",
    "also as pointed out in @xcite , the linear growth rate of an absolute instability in a bounded geometry is reduced by the  absorping \" end plate , with the reduction extent proportional to @xmath48 , where the aspect ratio is @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the height of the cylinders ( see fig .",
    "[ princeton_full_scheme ] ) .",
    "interestingly the linear growth rate with ideal couette state at both endcaps ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_br_outside ] ) matches the growth rate of the fastest growing mode , which naturally is the dominant mode , got from a linear code developed by @xcite , in which vertical periodicity is assumed , but the radial equations are solved directly by finite differences with perfectly insulating boundary conditions ( table  [ princeton_compare_with_global ] ) .",
    "the agreement suggests that viscous effects are slight , since the no - slip conditions on the horizontal velocities at the endcaps differ from the periodicity imposed by the linear code .",
    "mri essentially is a weak field instability .",
    "it is characteristic of mri for a strong magnetic field to suppress this instability .",
    "our experimental facility can only allow @xmath51 .",
    "thus we need to try carefully to find one set of proper parameters under which one growing mode is present with low @xmath21 while absent with larger @xmath21 .",
    "[ suppress ] demonstrates this property for simulations in which the boundary rotation rates @xmath52 are scaled to 45% of their designed values ( table.[ta_parameter ] ) .",
    "for @xmath53 , the final state is not steady .",
    "typical time averaged flow and field patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_final_pattern ] .",
    "the poloidal flux and stream functions are defined so that @xmath54 which imply @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the divergence of the velocity field in these compressible but subsonic simulations is nonzero but small .",
    "we note that the induced toroidal field is around @xmath57 of the initial axially imposed magnetic field at this magnetic reynolds number @xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "the most striking feature is the inflowing `` jet '' centered near @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_final_pattern ] ( see also fig .  [ ring2_100_1000_vr ] ) , which is opposite to the usual ekman circulation @xcite .",
    "it seems that the rapid outflowing  jet \" found in @xcite with vertically periodic boundary condition , where the position of the  jet \" is arbitrary , is shifted to the boundary layer , near the end caps in the experiment .",
    "the inward  jet \" near the inner cylinder part is a direct consequence of mri . for mri - stable regimes ,",
    "@xcite discuss the influence of independently controlled split endcaps upon the poloidal circulation and the influence of the axial magnetic field and reynolds number upon the stewartson and ekman layers .",
    "in such regimes , an _ outflowing _ jet occurs near the inner cylinder , in our apparatus , as it does in purely hydrodynamic ekman circulation ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "however in the mri - unstable regime for the same elsasser number @xmath17 , the middle clock - wise cell enlarges both horizontally and vertically and eventually dominates the other cells , which retreat to the corners if the instability is strong enough .",
    "this leads to one inflowing  jet \" near the inner cylinder ( fig .",

    "the inflowing jet was found in simulations with the ideal couette state imposed at the end caps , to remove ekman circulation ( fig .",

    "[ princeton_couette_stream ] shows a clear inflowing jet near the inner cylinder in this case ( see also fig .",
    "[ ideal_100_1000_vr ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the poloidal circulation seen in the final state in the split - endcap cases ( fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_final_pattern ] ( b ) ) is caused solely by saturation of mri rather than ( magnetically modified ) ekman circulation .",
    "astrophysicists are interested in the angular momentum transport due to mri since mri is supposed to be the most probable mechanism to explain the fast accretion in the astrophysical disks .",

    "in contrast to the final state for vertically periodic boundary conditions @xcite , the total radial torque is not constant with radius . since our numerical scheme conserves angular momentum",
    "exactly , we can infer a vertical flux arising from exchange of angular momentum with the endcaps ( see also fig .",
    "[ princeton_ring2_integral_torque_z ] ) . in the statistical steady state",
    "( nonlinearly saturated final state ) the sum of the angular momentum flux on all boundaries should be zero , at least on time average . in this case it is fluctuating since",
    "the final state is not steady given high reynolds number . from the gradients of the radial torque , we identify four ekman circulation cells : where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , the fluid is losing ( gaining ) angular momentum at the endcaps and the boundary - layer flow is therefore radially inward ( outward ) .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion in @xcite of the poloidal circulation driven by two split rings .",
    "the radial magnetic and advective torques vanish at @xmath6 and @xmath7 because of the boundary conditions but are important at intermediate radii , especially the advective .",

    "the maximum relative error ratio , defined as the ratio of the absolute difference of the value from the simulation and the fitted value ( eq .",

    "this corresponds to the final states of the mri experiment .",

    "from these two scaling laws , _ the mri indeed enhances the angular momentum transport at saturation , though slightly _",
    "( see discussion below ) .",
    "the enhancement is far beyond the arrange of the error bar ( see the error bars on panel ( a ) of fig .  [ 100_ratio ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable for @xmath79 in both magnetized and unmagnetized cases to decrease with increasing @xmath71 since the viscous coupling to the walls scales as @xmath80 in standard unmagnetized ekman layers ( _ i.e. _ the endcaps are corotating solidly with the outer cylinder ) . in this more complicated case ( with split rings ) , we also expect a similar relationship , though the magnetized ekman and stewartson layers complicate the problem @xcite .    if eq .",
    "[ torque_scaling1 ] and eq .",
    "[ torque_scaling2 ] also work at larger reynolds numbers , so that they may safely be extrapolated to the experimental reynolds number ( @xmath81 , 100% run ) , then the total radial torque of the initial and final state at the inner cylinder may be as large as @xmath82}}\\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath83}}\\nonumber\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "thus , the ratio of the increase of the torque over the initial torque is : @xmath84 , which is quite measurable and indicates that at the experimental reynolds number mri would dominate the residual magnetic ekman circulation in the point of view of transporting the angular momentum .",
    "there are , however , reasons for caution in accepting this estimate . for example , the experimental flow may be three - dimensional and turbulent , which might result in an even higher torque in the final state , and the absolute values of both the exponents seem to decrease at larger reynolds number and the difference of these two exponents is small .",
    "these concerns all make the extrapolation of eq .",
    "[ torque_scaling1 ] and eq .",
    "[ torque_scaling2 ] to the experimental reynolds number a bit risky .",
    "nevertheless , we expect a noticeable torque enhancement in the mri - unstable regime .    from fig .",
    "[ 100_ratio ] ( b ) , we can see that : ( 1 ) at larger reynolds number , @xmath85 is increased , which means that larger part of the total angular momentum is transported vertically .",
    "( 2 ) in the mri stable regime ( @xmath86 ) , the magnetic field enhances the vertical transport of the angular momentum .",
    "this is also reasonable since the magnetic field would align the flow , thus having the cells elongating and penetrating deeper into the bulk .",
    "the size of the middle cells is increased vertically by the residual magnetic ekman circulation .",
    "these are consistent with the conclusions deduced in @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) in the mri unstable regime ( @xmath87 ) , the onset of the mri results in more angular momentum transported radially outwards and less vertically .",
