    "from the early days of quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle was one of its the most significant features , as it shows in what respect the quantum theory differs from its classical counterpart .",
    "it was manifested that the variances of the two noncommuting observables can not be simultaneously arbitrarily small .",
    "therefore , if we prepare the quantum state as an eigenstate of one observable we get the perfect knowledge about the corresponding physical quantity , however , we loose ability to predict the effect of measurement of the second , noncommuting observable . preparing a state one shall always consider some trade  off regarding the observables which will be specified in the experiment .",
    "limits for such a trade  off have been formulated as different uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "however , we shall point out that these uncertainty relations are not necessarily related to noncommuting observables , but may describe the trade  off originating from different descriptions of the same quantum state . as an example consider the entropic uncertainty relation @xcite derived for two probability distributions related to the same quantum state in position and momentum representations .    the original formulation of heisenberg @xcite of the uncertainty principle concerns the product of variances of two non - commuting observables .",

    "measuring an observable @xmath5 in each copy of this state results with the standard deviation @xmath6 , while @xmath7 denotes an analogous expression for another observable @xmath8 . according to the approach of robertson @xcite the product of these deviations",

    "if the operators @xmath5 and @xmath8 do not commute it is thus impossible to specify simultaneously precise values of both observables .",
    "uncertainty relations can also be formulated for other quantities characterizing the distributions of the measurement outcomes .",
    "one possible choice is to use entropy which leads to entropic uncertainty relations of biaynicki  birula and mycielski @xcite .",
    "this formulation can be considered as a generalization of the standard approach as it implies the relations of heisenberg .    in the case of a finite dimensional hilbert space",
    "the uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the shannon entropy .",

    "the so called _ collapse of wave function _ during the measurement is often considerd as another characteristic feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "this postulate of quantum theory implies that the measurement disturbs the quantum state subjected to the process of quantum measurement . in general ,",
    "describing a quantum operation performed on an arbitrary state one can consider a kind of trade  off relations between the efficiency of the measurement and the disturbance introduced to the measured states .",
    "even though the trade  off relations were investigated from the beginnings of quantum mechanics , this field became a subject of a considerable scientific interest in the recent decade @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ disturbance _ of a state introduced by maccone @xcite , can be related to the average fidelity between an initial state of the system and and the state after the measurement @xcite .",
    "another version of disturbance can be defined as a difference between the initial entropy of a quantum state and the coherent information between the system and the measuring apparatus @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will investigate a single measurement process described by a quantum operation : a complete positive , trace preserving linear map which acts on an input state of size @xmath1 .",
    "we attempt to compare the information loss introduced by the map ( disturbance ) with the information the receiver knows about the outgoing state before the measurement ( the information gained by the apparatus ) .",
    "the former quantity can be characterized @xcite by the entropy of a map @xmath22 , equal to the von neumann entropy of the quantum state which corresponds to the considered map by the jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity will be described by the _ singular quantum entropy _ @xmath23 of jumarie @xcite , given by the shannon entropy of the normalized vector of singular values of the superoperator matrix .",
    "we are going to show that the sum of these two entropies is bounded from below by @xmath2 .",
