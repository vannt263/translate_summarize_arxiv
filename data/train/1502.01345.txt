    "when a star orbits close to a massive black hole ( @xmath11m@xmath5 ) such that its periastron distance is @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radius and the mass of the star , respectively ) , it will be disrupted and cause what is commonly referred to as a tidal disruption event ( hill 1975 ; rees 1988 ) . a fraction ( roughly 50% ) of the stellar debris escapes while the rest is put in a highly eccentric orbit around the black hole , triggering the accretion process ( e.g. , evans & kochanek 1989 ; lodato & rossi 2011 ) .",
    "these events are unique in the sense that they provide a one - time opportunity to study the onset of accretion and the formation of accretion disks and jets , which are currently only poorly understood .    for disrupting black holes with masses @xmath15m@xmath5",
    ", the initial accretion rate can exceed their eddington limit by a factor of a few tens ( e.g. , giannios & metzger 2011 ) .",
    "numerical studies suggest that such high accretion rates should produce outflows / jets driven by strong radiative pressure forces ( e.g. , ohsuga et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although the precise jet launching mechanism is still highly debated ( see tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) , we know from x - ray and radio observations of black hole binaries and active galactic nuclei that jets and accretion are mutually dependent ( e.g. , merloni et al . 2003",
    "; falcke et al . 2004 ; plotkin et al .",
    "therefore , accretion initiated by the tidal disruption of a star is anticipated to be a natural site for producing jets .",
    "given that the black hole jet directions , are uniformly distributed over the sky , most of the jetted events will be offset from our line of sight owing to collimation .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that off - axis relativistic jets , although initially unobservable because of doppler beaming , should be detectable after a few years when the ejecta slow down to mildly relativistic speeds ( giannios & metzger 2011 ) . but",
    "recent radio follow - up studies of tidal disruption events ( tdes ) spanning 122yr after the initial disruption have detected radio emission from only @xmath16% of the sample ( see tables 1 & 2 of van velzen et al .",
    "2013 ) , suggesting that maybe only a specific subset of events  those requiring special conditions  produce relativistic jets ( bower et al . 2013 ; van velzen et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "_ swift _ j164449.3 + 573451 ( sw  j1644 + 57 , hereafter ) is the first and the best - studied relativistic tde ( one accompanied by a relativistic outflow ; e.g. , levan et al .",
    "2011 ; bloom et al . 2011 ; burrows et al . 2011 ; zauderer et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "the main observed properties of this source are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) long - lived ( @xmath17yr ) , luminous ( @xmath18ergs@xmath19 ) , rapidly variable x - ray emission with a power - law secular decline ; ( 2 ) self - absorbed radio emission indicative of relativistic ejecta ; ( 3 ) location consistent with the nucleus of a redshift @xmath20 , compact , mildly star - forming galaxy ; and ( 4 ) significant ( @xmath21% ) near - infrared ( nir ) polarization , strongly favoring an on - axis viewing angle ( wiersema et al .",
    "observations at late times ( @xmath22d ) have both reinforced and complicated this picture .",
    "the overall trend of sw  j1644 + 57 s x - ray light curve , neglecting the short - timescale variability , can be described by a more or less constant plateau stage in the first 10d ( rest frame)@xmath23 followed by a power - law decline with an index consistent with both @xmath24 and @xmath25 , corresponding to a complete and a partial disruption of the star@xmath26 , respectively ( see figure 1 of tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2014 ; see also the gray data points in the top panel of figure 1 of this paper ) .",
    "the x - ray intensity of the source drops abruptly by a factor of @xmath27 over a timescale of @xmath28 roughly a year after the disruption ( see figure 4 of zauderer et al .",
    "this has been attributed to jet turnoff when the mass accretion rate dropped below the eddington value , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the eddington luminosity , radiative efficiency , and speed of light , respectively ( zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "radio emission was detected from the source @xmath33d ( rest frame ) after its discovery in the hard x - rays ( zauderer et al .",
    "this early stage radio emission has been argued to represent relativistic jetted emission directly pointed along our line of sight ( zauderer et al .",
    "a follow - up radio campaign showed that the radio emission brightened starting about one month after discovery ( observer frame ; berger et al .",
    "berger et al . ( 2012 ) interpret this increase in energy as slower ejecta catching up with the forward shock at late times , although other explanations also exist ( e.g. , barniol duran & piran 2013 ) .",
    "sw  j1644 + 57 is an exceptional tde with signatures of a strong jet .",
    "unfortunately , its host galaxy has a large line - of - sight extinction ( levan et al .",
    "2011 ) , making it challenging to study the evolution of the accretion disk expected to be observable in the ultraviolet / optical / infrared ( uvoir ; e.g. , strubbe & quataert 2009 ; lodato & rossi 2011 ) .",
    "although we have learned a great deal from sw  j1644 + 57 , the question of what aspect makes it conducive to produce a relativistic jet still remains . to answer this question , one approach would be to build a census of sw  j1644 + 57-like sources .",
    "it has also been suggested that sw  j1644 + 57 could represent a tidal disruption of a white dwarf by a member of the long - sought intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; mass range of a few @xmath34m@xmath5 ; krolik & piran 2011 ) . with only a handful of strong cases of such black holes",
    "known thus far ( e.g. , eso hlx x-1 : farrell et al .",

    "; m82 x-1 : kaaret et al .",
    "2009 ; pasham , strohmayer , & mushotzky 2014 ) , studying such systems could provide insight into weighing and hence identifying such unique objects .",

    "j2058.4 + 0516 ( hereafter sw  j2058 + 05 ) , on 2011 may 17 ( cenko et al .",
    "2012 ; hereafter c12 ) .",
    "an early - time ( @xmath35 months since discovery ) , multiwavelength study showed a number of similarities with sw  j1644 + 57 ( c12 ) .",
    "more specifically , sw  j2058 + 05 occupied the same location in the x - ray versus optical luminosity plot as sw  j1644 + 57 , and its early - phase ( 20d after outburst ; rest frame ) radio , uvoir , and x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was similar to that of sw  j1644 + 57 ( see figures 4 & 5 of c12 ) .",
    "more importantly , strong radio emission coincident with the x - rays was detected @xmath36d after the initial trigger , suggesting relativistic ejecta ( c12 ) .",
    "unlike sw  j1644 + 57 , sw  j2058 + 05 shows no evidence for line - of - sight extinction ( c12 ) , so we can study the system at uvoir wavelengths in more detail . if it can be established that sw  j2058 + 05 behaves analogously to sw  j1644 + 57",
    ", then we can start to gain confidence that there is a class of such relativistic tdes .",
    "this paper is a follow - up work to c12 and we address the remaining questions .",
    "( 1 ) how does sw  j2058 + 05 evolve on longer timescales ?",
    "( 2 ) assuming the uvoir can be modeled with a single - temperature blackbody , how do the properties of the putative blackbody evolve on these timescales ? ( 3 ) is the emission consistent with originating from the center of the host galaxy ?",
    "( 4 ) what is the mass of the disrupting black hole ?",

    "xspecv12.8.2 _ ( arnaud 1996 ) , we then fitted this combined 0.310kev energy spectrum with a power - law model modified by absorption ( _ phabs@xmath60zwabs@xmath60pow _ in xspec ) .",
    "the galactic column density was fixed at @xmath61@xmath62 ( kalberla et al .",

    "the best - fit power - law index and intrinsic absorption column density were @xmath64 and @xmath65atoms@xmath62 , respectively ( with a reduced @xmath66 for 102 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we then used these best - fit power - law model parameters ( fixing the power - law index and the absorbing column density but keeping the power - law normalization free ) and extracted the source flux from each of the individual observations .",
    "we only considered observations with a total number of counts greater than 50 . in cases where the total number of counts was less than 50 , we averaged neighboring observations .",
    "the best - fit absorbed power - law model ( with fixed power - law index and absorbing column ) yielded a reduced @xmath67 in an acceptable range of 0.51.3 for these individual epochs .",
    "we then fitted each of the three _ xmm - newton_/epic ( both pn and mos simultaneously ) x - ray spectra of sw  j2058 + 05 using the same model as above ( _ phabs@xmath60zwabs@xmath60pow _ ) .",
    "we generated the epic response files using the @xmath68 and @xmath69 tools which are part of _ xmm - newton _ s sas software .",
    "given that each of these observations had total counts in excess of 1600 , we left all the model parameters free to vary except for the redshift and the milky way column density .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are indicated in table 4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the best - fit absorbing column densities are consistent with the value derived from the combined _ swift _ xrt data acquired at early times , the power - law indices are slightly steeper at late times .",
    "the luminosity values derived from modeling the _ xmm - newton _ spectra are indicated by the magenta squares in figure 1 .",
    "the source was not detectable in the _ chandra / acis _ images with the naked eye .",
    "nevertheless , using the ciao task _ srcflux _ , we estimated an upper limit to the 0.310kev x - ray flux for poisson statistics .",
    "in doing so , we assumed that the source spectrum is defined by an absorbed power - law model with the parameters estimated from the _ xmm - newton _ data ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the power - law index and the intrinsic absorption column density were set to 1.79 and @xmath70atoms@xmath62 , respectively ( mean of the _ xmm - newton _ values ) .",
    "the isotropic luminosity upper limits are indicated by the blue squares in figure 1 .",
    "in addition , we studied the short - term variability of the source on timescales of a few hundred to a few thousand seconds using the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "we first extracted a combined epic ( pn and mos ) light curve from each of the three _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "one such light curve ( black ) along with the background ( red ) binned with a time resolution of 500 s is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is clear that the source varies significantly , with the most drastic variation around 32,000s when the overall count rate changes by a factor of 2.5 within a timescale of @xmath71s . to further confirm the variability",
    ", we modeled the light curve with a constant .",
    "the best - fit model gave 0.073 counts s@xmath19 with a reduced @xmath67 of 2.3 ( @xmath72 for 102 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "again , this suggests that a constant count rate model is strongly disfavored .",
    "rapid x - ray variability on similar timescales has also been observed from sw  j1644 + 57 ( e.g. , krolik & piran 2011 ) and also nonrelativistic tde candidates such as sdss  j120136.02 + 300305.5 ( see figure 5 of saxton et al .",
    "2012 ) .    finally , to test for any possible coherent oscillations in the x - rays ( 0.310kev ) , we extracted a power - density spectrum using the longest _ xmm - newton _ observation ( obsid : 0694830201 ) with an effective exposure of roughly 48ks .",
    "we find that the power spectrum is flat ( white noise ) and is consistent with being featureless ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "dynamical friction within a galaxy ensures that supermassive black holes sink to the center within a few gyr after formation ( e.g. , equation 4 of miller & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , if sw  j2058 + 05 is an event caused by a supermassive black hole , it should arise from the center of the host galaxy . to constrain the ( projected ) offset between the transient emission from sw  j2058 + 05 and its underlying host , we took three approaches .",
    "first , we compared the vlba position for sw  j2058 + 05 (  2.5 ) with the host localization derived from _",
    "hst_. we used the @xmath48 image from 2014 for this purpose ( as opposed to the @xmath46 images obtained in dec .",
    "2013 ) , owing to its higher snr and smaller native pixel scale . while the vlba position for sw  j2058 + 05 is the most precise available , the dominant source of uncertainty results from alignment of the _ hst _ images onto the fk5 reference grid using common point sources from 2mass ( 60mas in each coordinate ) .",
    "after alignment , we measured a position for the host centroid in the _ hst _ images of @xmath73 , @xmath74 . as this",
    "is offset from the vlba position by 58mas , we conclude that the radio position is consistent with the host nucleus , within our uncertainties .",
    "next , we performed digital image subtraction on our @xmath46 images obtained on 2011 aug .",
    "30 ( top - left panel of figure 4 ) and 2013 dec .",
    "10 ( top - right panel of figure 4 ) to more precisely constrain the _ relative _ transient - host offset ( e.g. , levan et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting subtraction image is displayed in the bottom - left panel of figure 4 .",
    "assuming that the flux in the final epoch of imaging is dominated by the host galaxy , we measured a radial offset between the transient emission and the host centroid of 0.34 pixels ( i.e. , 22mas ) .",
    "including contributions to the relative astrometric uncertainty from image alignment ( 0.18 pixel in each coordinate ) and measurement of the host centroid ( 0.10 pixel in each coordinate ) , we find a null probability of measuring such an offset of 27% ( assuming a rayleigh distribution for the radial offset ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the transient emission is consistent with the host nucleus at this level of precision , as well .    finally , we measured the relative offset between the 2011 @xmath47 images of sw  j2058 + 05 ( dominated by transient emission ) and our 2014 @xmath48 image of the field ( presumed to be host dominated ) .",
    "we find that the centroids in the two images are offset by 10mas , while our alignment uncertainty is only 15mas in each coordinate .",
    "this method offers the most precise constraint on the relative transient - host offset , and we formally place a 90% confidence limit of @xmath75mas , corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath76pc at @xmath63 .",
    "this is comparable to the limits on the transient - host offset derived for sw  j1644 + 57 ( @xmath77pc ( 1@xmath58 ) at @xmath20 ; levan et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the uvoir sed of sw  j2058 + 05 at early times ( @xmath78yr , observer frame ) is quite blue , significantly more so than one would expect from simple forward - shock models ( e.g. , granot & sari 2002 ) . motivated by the observed seds in nonrelativistic tdes ( e.g. , gezari et al .",
    "2012 ) , we fit , wherever possible , the uvoir seds with a single - temperature blackbody . the best - fit model parameters from the six epochs are indicated in table 5 . including host - galaxy extinction as an additional free parameter in modeling these seds",
    "did not improve the fits .",
    "formally , we limit the host extinction to @xmath79 mag ( 90% confidence ) , assuming it has an extinction law similar to that in the milky way ( pei 1992 ) .    all of the seds along with the best - fit model are shown in the top panel of figure 5 .",
    "we show the evolution of the temperature and the radius of the blackbody in the bottom - left and bottom - right panels , respectively .",
    "there is clear evidence for a decrease in the blackbody temperature at late times before the x - ray flux drops off , and marginal evidence for an increase in the radius . but",
    "given the large error bars in the radii , we can not strongly rule - out the possibility that the radius remains constant throughout",
    ". we also note , however , that with reduced @xmath80 values as low as we find in several epochs , the quoted uncertainties should be treated with some degree of caution .",
    "regardless , it is clear that the emission has become much redder in our final epoch , with a largely flat sed in @xmath81 .      our highest - snr spectrum , obtained with keck / lris on 2011 aug .",
    "28 , is plotted in figure 6 .",
    "we also fit our keck / lris spectra to single - temperature blackbody models , and find @xmath82k on 2011 aug . 2 and @xmath83k on 2011 aug .",
    "28 ( solid green line in figure 6 ) .",
    "these results are largely consistent with the values derived from our broadband photometry , providing additional confidence in the above analysis .    for comparison , in figure 6",
    "we also plot the composite quasar ( qso ) spectrum from sdss ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) , and a spectrum taken near maximum light of the tde ps1 - 10jh ( gezari et al . 2012 ) . in all cases",
    "the spectra of sw  j2058 + 05 are dominated by a blue , featureless continuum .",
    "no obvious emission or absorption features are detected in any spectra , with the exception of the initial spectrum from 2011 june 1 presented in c12 , from which the redshift of @xmath84 = 1.1853 was derived from narrow and absorption lines . clearly",
    ", the strong , broad emission lines that dominate qsos in the near - uv ( e.g. , , ] , and ) are not present in our spectra of sw  j2058 + 05 .",
    "in addition to a hot ( @xmath85k ) blackbody continuum , ps1 - 10jh displayed high - ionization @xmath864686 and @xmath863203 emission lines .",
    "our keck / lris spectra do not probe sufficiently far into the rest - frame optical to cover the stronger @xmath864686 feature .",
    "we see no evidence for broad emission at this location in our xshooter spectra ; however , the snr is quite low in these data .",
    "a number of optically discovered tdes also display broad h@xmath87 emission ( arcavi et al .",
    "2014 ; holoien et al .",
    "2014 ) , although it is unclear if the presence / absence of h is due to properties of the disrupted star ( gezari et al .",
    "2012 ) or the radial extent of the newly formed accretion disk ( guillochon et al .",
    "again , we detect no evidence for broad emission lines at rest - frame h@xmath87 ( or any other balmer lines , for that matter ) , but are limited by the low snr at these wavelengths .    we can also limit the presence of narrow , nebular emission lines from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "in particular , we do not detect either [ ] @xmath863727 or h@xmath87 .",
    "if we assume unresolved emission lines at these wavelengths , we calculate limiting flux values of @xmath88 ( ) @xmath89ergs@xmath19@xmath62 and @xmath88(h@xmath87 ) @xmath90ergs@xmath19@xmath62 . using the relations from kennicutt ( 1998 ) between emission - line luminosity and star - formation rate , we limit the presence of recent star formation in the host of sw  j2058 + 05 to be @xmath91m@xmath5yr@xmath19 ( uncorrected for extinction ) .",
    "this is consistent with an estimate of the star - formation rate derived from the uv ( @xmath48 ) luminosity of the host galaxy , for which we find 0.8m@xmath5yr@xmath19 ( using the calibration from kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the detection of radio emission from sw  j2058 + 05 confirms the presence of nonthermal electrons in the circumnuclear ejecta .",
    "we can apply standard equipartition arguments ( readhead 1994 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) to place a lower limit on the size of the radio - emitting region . using the formulation valid for relativistic outflows from barniol duran et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , our vlba detection at @xmath49d ( rest frame ) implies @xmath92 cm .",
    "similarly , these observations , though not as constraining as those presented by c12 cm , @xmath93 , and @xmath94erg . ] , imply at least transrelativistic expansion ( @xmath95 ) from an energetic outflow ( @xmath96erg ) .",
    "the above limit on the physical size of the radio - emitting region corresponds to a lower limit on the angular size of @xmath97@xmath52as , where @xmath98 is the jet opening angle . for any feasible jet opening angle ,",
    "this result is consistent with the unresolved nature of the source in the vlba imaging ( @xmath99mas ) .",
    "to better understand the nature of sw  j2058 + 05 , we first consider the origin of the emission in the three regimes probed here : radio , uvoir , and x - ray .",
    "we derived a robust lower limit on the size of the radio - emitting region ( based solely on equipartition arguments in  3.5 ) , @xmath100 cm .",
    "together with more stringent limits on the bulk lorentz factor from c12 ( @xmath101 ) , we conclude that the radio emission is generated by the forward shock of a newly formed , at least mildly relativistic jet .",
    "an identical conclusion was reached by several authors ( e.g. , zauderer et al .",
    "2011 ; bloom et al . 2011 ) in the case of sw  j1644 + 57 .    the x - rays , on the other hand ,",
    "must clearly have a distinct origin .",
    "the rapid variability on a rest - frame timescale of @xmath102s require the size of the x - ray - emitting region to be @xmath103 cm .",
    "this clearly rules out a forward - shock origin .",
    "however , the tremendous peak x - ray luminosity , many orders of magnitude above eddington for any feasible black hole , suggests some association with the newly formed jet ( as does the rapid turnoff ; see below ) .",
    "one possibility is that the x - rays are generated in the base of the jet ( e.g. , bloom et al .",
    "2011 ; zauderer et al .",
    "2011 ) , though the process by which this occurs remains a mystery .",
    "again , the analogy with sw  j1644 + 57 holds well .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the uvoir data , both photometry and spectra , are well fit by a single - temperature blackbody with @xmath104 few @xmath105k . the inferred blackbody radius , which appears to remain roughly constant , is @xmath106 cm .",
    "together with the long - lived blue colors , the radius also seems to disfavor a forward - shock origin for the uvoir component .",
    "similarly , the derived blackbody spectrum severely underpredicts the observed x - ray flux .    instead , these values are consistent with spectral studies of nonrelativistic tde candidates in the literature with apparent blackbody temperatures and radii in the range of ( 110 ) @xmath105k and ( 0.120 ) @xmath107 cm , respectively ( e.g. , gezari et al . 2009b , 2012 ; armijo & de freitas pacheco 2013 ; guillochon et al .",
    "2014 ; chornock et al . 2014 ; cenko et al . 2012b ; holoien et al . 2014 ; arcavi et al .",
    "2014 ) , although there are some tde candidates that tend to show higher disk temperatures of @xmath108k accompanied by smaller emitting regions of size @xmath109 cm ( e.g. , gezari et al . 2008 ) . however , for any plausible black hole mass , the blackbody radius is orders of magnitude larger than the radius at which disruption should occur .",
    "such large radii have been attributed to reprocessing in some external region ( see , for example , the numerical simulations of guillochon et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "it is important to note here , that while sw  j1644 + 57 lacked detectable uv and optical emission , the high degree of polarization observed in the nir was attributed to jetted emission from the forward shock ( wiersema et al .",
    "2012 ) , and not from the ( presumably largely isotropic ) accretion disk .",
    "naively , unless the reprocessing region was nonisotropic , we would expect a low degree of optical polarization from sw  j2058 + 05 if this simplistic picture is correct . for future relativistic tde candidates",
    ", polarization observations would be an important test of this model .      using the best - fit blackbody luminosities and integrating the resulting light curve ( using the trapezoidal rule ) in the rest frame between epochs 5.7 and 181.4d",
    ", we estimate the total uvoir energy radiated to be @xmath110erg .",
    "similarly , we integrated the x - ray light curve ( top panel of figure 1 ) and estimate the total isotropic energy to be @xmath111erg . assuming an opening angle of @xmath112 rad , similar to what has been estimated for sw  j1644 + 57 ( zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ; metzger et al .",
    "2012 ) , we measure the total , beaming - corrected x - ray energy output to be @xmath113erg .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is , however , expected to be a factor of a few higher than the x - ray luminosity . assuming the bolometric value is a factor of 3 ( similar to that of sw  j1644 + 57 ; burrows et al . 2011 ) , one can estimate the total accreted mass onto the black hole using equation 5 of the supplemental information of burrows et al .",
    "we find this value to be @xmath112m@xmath5 , which is comparable to sw  j1644 + 57 s 0.2m@xmath5 ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ; zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ) , both appropriate for disruption of a @xmath50m@xmath5 star .      the x - ray emission from sw  j2058 + 05 drops abruptly between days 200 and 300 ( rest frame ) , consistent with what was seen for sw  1644 + 57 ( top panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "more specifically , sw  j2058 + 05 s intensity decreases by a factor of @xmath0 within a span of @xmath114 compared to sw  j1644 + 57 s factor of @xmath27 decline over a span of @xmath28 ( levan & tanvir 2012 ; sbarufatti et al . 2012 ; zauderer et al .",
    "interestingly , in both of these sources , the x - ray dimming occurs on a comparable timescale after disruption .    in the case of sw  j1644 + 57 ,",
    "zauderer et al . (",
    "2013 ) interpreted this sudden decrease in the flux as an accretion - mode transition from a super - eddington to a sub - eddington state .",
    "this is consistent with the transitioning timescale predicted from numerical simulations ( e.g. , figures 4 & 2 of evans & kochanek 1989 and de colle et al .",
    "2012 , respectively ) .",
    "assuming the same process is responsible for the abrupt flux change in sw  j2058 + 05 , we can attempt to estimate the mass of the black hole by equating the luminosity at turnoff to the eddington luminosity . from the x - ray light curve (",
    "see tables 1 & 4 ) , it is evident that the isotropic x - ray luminosity drops from @xmath115ergs@xmath19 to less than @xmath116ergs@xmath19 , suggesting an eddington value somewhere in between these two limits .",
    "using these two values and assuming radiative efficiency , beaming angle , and bolometric correction values of 0.1 , 0.1 rad , and 30% , respectively ( similar to sw  j1644 + 57 ; burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) , we constrained the black hole mass @xmath117 to be @xmath118m@xmath119m@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations suggest that the time to dropoff ( transition from super - eddington to sub - eddington ) since the disruption is shorter for more massive black holes ( see figure 2 of de colle et al .",
    "the x - ray dropoff in sw  j2058 + 05 occurs @xmath120d earlier than that in sw  j1644 + 57 , suggesting that its black hole may be more massive .    however , it is interesting to note that even the optical light curves of sw  j2058 + 05 undergo an abrupt change during an epoch roughly consistent with the x - ray dimming ( see the bottom panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "we find that the optical flux , for instance in the @xmath121 band , drops by a factor of at least 5 within a narrow span of @xmath122 .",
    "we speculate , within the context of the following simple model , that the x - rays are coming from the base of the jet and the optical originates from the reprocessed uv / soft - x - ray disk photons in the ambient medium .",
    "in such a scenario , the proposed super - eddington to sub - eddington accretion transition would presumably change the accretion - disk structure to lower its emission , thus explaining the reduction in the amount of the reprocessed light .",
    "obviously , the true situation is more complicated , with specific details about the radiative efficiency , beaming , and other factors .",
    "it can be better understood with more detailed modeling , but this is beyond the scope of the current paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "the longterm x - ray light curve of sw  j2058 + 05 does not exhibit the numerous sudden dips observed in sw  j1644 + 57 ( see figure 1 ) . in the case of sw  j1644 + 57",
    ", it has been argued that the x - ray dips originate from jet precession and nutation , which causes it to briefly to go out of our line of sight ( e.g. , saxton et al .",
    "we speculate , based on the lack of such dips in sw  j2058 + 05 , that its jet may be more stable compared to sw  j1644 + 57 .",
    "however given the poor sampling of the x - ray light curve , the current data can not completely rule - out the presence of dips in sw  j2058 + 05 .",
    "the mass limits derived above based on the x - ray turnoff are consistent with other methods of estimating @xmath123 .",
    "first , we can use the x - ray variability timescale to place an upper limit on black hole mass . equating the limit on the size of the x - ray - emitting region with a schwarzschild radius",
    "suggests a compact object of mass less than @xmath124m@xmath5 .    also , assuming that the optical flux in our final two _ hst _ epochs is dominated by the host galaxy ( and not transient emission ) , we can constrain the mass of the central supermassive black hole using the well - known bulge luminosity vs. black hole mass relations ( e.g. , lauer et al .",
    "2007 ) . neglecting for the moment k - corrections [ aside from the cosmological @xmath125 factor ] , the distance modulus at @xmath63 implies an absolute magnitude of @xmath126 from the @xmath48 observation ( approximately rest - frame @xmath127 band ) and @xmath128 from the @xmath46 observation ( approximately rest - frame @xmath129 band ) .",
    "both suggest @xmath130mag , or an inferred supermassive black hole mass of @xmath131m@xmath5 .",
    "while there is significant scatter in the bulge luminosity vs. black hole mass relation , our limits are conservative in the sense that they assume _ all _ of the observed luminosity derives from the bulge ( and none from , say , a disk ) . at the very least",
    ", we can robustly conclude that @xmath132m@xmath5 , the limit above which a nonspinning black hole can not tidally disrupt a solar mass main - sequence star ( rees 1988 ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to use multiwavelength data and study the long - term ( @xmath50yr ) behavior of candidate relativistic tde sw  j2058 + 05 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(2 ) rapid x - ray variability on a timescale @xmath6s at late times ( before the x - ray dropoff ) suggests that x - ray photons originate near the black hole and not from a forward shock .",
    "if the x - rays were to come from the forward shock , they would vary on much longer timescales .",
    "\\(3 ) based on the blackbody modeling of the optical data of sw  j2058 + 05 ( in ways not possible with sw  j1644 + 57 because of the large host - galaxy extinction ) , we find that the optical originates from farther out ( @xmath9 cm ) than the x - rays . also , the uvoir sed modeling severely underpredicts the x - ray emission .",
    "lastly , the early - time optical data did not show variability on timescales of a few 1000s , suggesting again an emission size of larger than a few 1000 light seconds .",
    "however , the x - rays originate very close to the black hole .",
    "we conclude based on these lines of evidence that the optical and the x - rays have distinct origins .",
    "\\(4 ) the size of the optically emitting region of sw  j2058 + 05 suggests that it originates from reprocessing .",
    "the fact that reprocessing is seen in x - ray - selected events ( as well as optical ones ) suggests it is a relatively common phenomenon .",
