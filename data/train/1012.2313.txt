    "the discovery of excess far - infrared emission from the nearby ( @xmath5  pc ; * ? ? ? * ) a6v - type main - sequence star @xmath0  pictoris @xcite together with optical imaging of scattered light from circumstellar dust @xcite established the `` debris disk '' paradigm where dust grains orbiting the star originate from an eroding reservoir of larger bodies ( see reviews by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nearly edge - on disk surrounding this young star ( @xmath6  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is relatively luminous ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been studied in great detail with a panoply of observational techniques .",
    "high resolution images in the optical @xcite , near - infrared @xcite and mid - infrared @xcite all show a wealth of structure , including density concentrations , an inner cavity , and asymmetries such as warps . these features , including a secondary disk of scattered light inclined by about @xmath8 @xcite ,",
    "have been variously ascribed to the gravitational influence of a giant planet or planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , a planetary mass companion at a projected distance of 8  au from the star now has been directly imaged @xcite .",
    "the emerging view of debris disks like @xmath0  pictoris postulates the presence of a planetesimal belt that produces dust with a range of sizes through collisional cascades @xcite .",
    "the stirring of the planetesimals may be due to the gravity of @xmath9  km - sized objects formed within the belt @xcite , or to the presence of planets located closer to the star @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the dynamical effects of stellar radiation create a distribution of grain sizes that depends on distance from the star , e.g. the blow - out of the smallest `` @xmath0-meteoroid '' grains .",
    "an important consequence is that images of debris disks at different wavelengths are dominated by different grain sizes and can appear remarkably different @xcite .",
    "observations at millimeter wavelengths are most sensitive to large grains that are minimally affected by radiative forces and thus have the potential to trace best the location of the dust producing parent planetesimals . the debris disk around vega , for example , shows a clumpy ring confined to radii @xmath10  au at wavelengths of 350  @xmath11 m and longward @xcite , while it appears smooth and featureless and extends to radii @xmath12  au in mid - infrared light that arises predominantly from small grains expelled by radiation @xcite . the debris disk around hr  8799 , an a - type star that harbors three directly imaged planets , shows similar morphological changes with wavelength @xcite .    for the @xmath0  pictoris debris disk , the angular resolutions of ( sub-)millimeter images have been too coarse to reveal much structure .",
    "images from several different telescopes generally show dust emission extended along a position angle of @xmath13 , consistent with the optical disk : jcmt / scuba at 850  @xmath11 m with a @xmath14 beam @xcite , apex / laboca at 870  @xmath11 m with an @xmath15 beam @xcite , sest / simba at 1200  @xmath11 m with a @xmath16 beam @xcite , and herschel / spire at 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath11 m with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 beams , respectively @xcite . a separate peak or blob of dust emission",
    "is also found @xmath20 to the southwest of the star , but the relationship of this peak to the main disk is unclear ; @xcite and @xcite have suggested it is a background galaxy with a coincidental alignment with the disk plane .",
    "millimeter interferometry offers a way to obtain higher angular resolution and more information on the largest detectable grain populations within the debris disk . in this _ letter _ , we present imaging observations of @xmath0  pictoris at 1.3  millimeters wavelength from the submillimeter array ( sma ) that reveal a belt of emission around the star centered near a radius of @xmath21  au that likely marks a reservoir of planetesimals .",
    "we used the eight element sma @xcite on mauna kea , hawaii to observe @xmath0  pictoris in the compact - north configuration ( baselines 6 - 97  m ) on 2010 august 9 , and in the extended configuration ( baselines 12 - 178  m ) on 2010 september 1 .",
    "the phase center was chosen to be @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) , about @xmath24 from the stellar position at the epoch of the observations . the @xmath0  pictoris system is a challenging target for the sma as it never rises above @xmath25 elevation . nonetheless , usable data were obtained in both configurations over the hour angle range @xmath26 .",
    "the weather conditions were good on both days , with 225  ghz atmospheric opacities 0.070.09 and stable atmospheric phase .",
    "the correlator was configured to provide the maximum 4  ghz of bandwidth in each of two sidebands centered @xmath27  ghz from a central lo frequency of 235.6  ghz ( wavelength of 1.3  millimeters ) , with a uniform spectral resolution of 0.8125  mhz . at this frequency , the primary beam size is @xmath28 ( fwhm ) .",
    "observations of the strong source 3c454.3 obtained at the start of each track were used to calibrate the passband response .",
    "observations of the quasars j0538 - 440 and j0522 - 364 were interleaved with @xmath0  pictoris in order to calibrate time dependent gain variations . the astrometric uncertainty is @xmath29 .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set with reference to observations of the standard calibrator callisto in each track and should be accurate to better than 15% .",
    "the calibration procedure was performed using the idl based mir software .",
    "subsequent imaging and deconvolution were done within the miriad package .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows a contour image of the 1.3  millimeter emission overlaying a hubble space telescope / stis coronographic image of optical scattered light from @xcite .",
    "the 1.3  millimeter image was made using natural weighting and a modest taper in the east - west direction to avoid extreme ellipticity of the synthesized beam , which is @xmath1 ( @xmath2  au ) oriented nearly north - south ( position angle @xmath30 ) .",
    "the maximum sidelobes of the dirty beam obtained with this weighting scheme are located about @xmath31 to the east and west , with amplitude 15% of the central peak .",
    "the rms noise in this image is 0.6  mjy  beam@xmath32 .",
    "the star symbol is plotted offset by @xmath33 from the phase center , within the uncertainties of the stellar position corrected for proper motion .",
    "the 1.3 millimeter emission shows two peaks at positions symmetrically offset from the stellar position by @xmath34 to the northeast and southwest , respectively .",
    "this basic morphology suggests a highly inclined ring or belt , where the peaks are due to limb brightening at the ansae ( where the column density is highest ) .",
    "while the southwest peak appears slightly brighter , the difference lies within the noise and can not be considered significant .",
    "because the sma observations are not sensitive enough to detect the stellar photosphere , the alignment of the images from the sma and hubble space telescope is limited by the absolute astrometry . even taking account of this uncertainty",
    ", it seems that the two millimeter emission peaks do not align perfectly along the @xmath35 position angle of the primary optical disk @xcite . instead ,",
    "examination of figure  [ fig : image ] suggests that the peaks align more closely with the @xmath36 position angle of the scattered light secondary disk described by @xcite .",
    "observations with better resolution and sensitivity are needed to confirm this suggestion ; the non - circular beam makes it difficult to assess small differences in orientation , and the millimeter emission structure itself may prove to be warped or more complex .",
    "the 1.3  millimeter flux in the detected structure is @xmath37  mjy , estimated by integrating over the emission in the image .",
    "this value is only approximately half of the @xmath38  mjy measured in the @xmath16 sest beam at 1.2  millimeters @xcite , a discrepancy significantly larger than expected from the mutual absolute calibration uncertainties and the spectral slope .",
    "the difference suggests the presence of an additional , extended 1.3  millimeter emission component , missed in these observations by the spatial filtering properties of the interferometer .",
    "given the shortest sma baselines , the peak brightness is diminished already by 50% for a @xmath39 ( fwhm ) gaussian source @xcite , a size scale smaller than the sest beam .",
    "judging from the partially resolved images from far - infrared and submillimeter filled aperture telescopes , this missing component is likely elongated along the disk , which extends beyond the sma field of view .",
    "the separate dust peak to the southwest is detected at @xmath40 , offset by ( @xmath41 ) from the center of the field ( not shown ) .",
    "the corresponding absolute position is @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( j2000 ) .",
    "because the primary beam correction is large and uncertain at this location beyond the half power point , it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the flux .",
    "the position is well determined , however , and shows that this peak does not lie along an extension of the optical disk .",
    "this supports previous suggestions that this feature is a background source , presumably a dusty galaxy .",
    "we constrain the basic properties of the 1.3 millimeter emission with a simple model that assumes the structure is characterized by a flat , axisymmetric belt of emission .",
    "we take the radial profile of the emission to be @xmath44 , which is physically motivated by optically thin emission for constant surface density and a temperature profile of @xmath44 due to stellar irradiation .",
    "we fix the inclination and orientation of the belt on the sky to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ; due to the limited resolution , small variations in these geometric parameters do not have significant effects on the results .",
    "this simple model has three parameters : the belt center @xmath47 , belt width @xmath48 , and flux @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate a grid of models over the parameter ranges @xmath50  au and @xmath51  au in steps of @xmath52  au , and @xmath53  mjy in steps of 0.5  mjy , and calculate @xmath54 values for each model using all of the sma visibilities .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : model ] shows the resulting @xmath54 surface ( marginalized over the parameter @xmath49 ) .",
    "the cross marks the best fit at @xmath55  au , @xmath56  au , @xmath57  mjy ; the uncertainties represent the formal @xmath58 errors .",
    "the data strongly constrain the belt center location and allow for widths up to sizes comparable to the resolution of the observations .",
    "the three left panels of figure  [ fig : model ] show the 1.3 millimeter image from figure  [ fig : image ] together with images of the best - fit model and the residuals , all made in the same way .",
    "the model reproduces the main features of the data , and the residuals are consistent with noise .",
    "if a steeper radial emissivity were assumed , then the outer edge of the emission could extend further .",
    "however , a belt with a width that encroaches much closer to the star than the best fit may be difficult to reconcile with the mid - infrared emission from the system . a proper model that considers the constraints of the full spectral energy distribution requires many more assumptions than made here , in particular about the grain composition , grain size distribution , collisional behaviors and dynamics .",
    "the new millimeter observations improve substantially on previous single dish images and start to resolve fine structure in the @xmath0  pictoris disk . since large grains can not travel far from their place of origin due to short grain - grain collisional timescales and negligible radiation effects , the emission at this long wavelength should trace the dust producing planetesimals .",
    "inspection and analysis of the resolved millimeter emission suggest a highly inclined ring or belt centered at a radius within or near @xmath21  au . aside from the nearly edge - on viewing geometry",
    ", the millimeter morphology is strikingly similar to other well - studied a - type stars with substantial circumstellar dust , in particular vega ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and fomalhaut ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the region interior to this belt in @xmath0  pictoris is clearly not empty , as evidenced by mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , but it must be relatively deficient in dust mass or millimeter - sized grains or both .",
    "the location of the millimeter emission belt corresponds closely to a prominent break in the slope of the optical scattered light , as well as a change in the optical color gradient @xcite .",
    "these properties are plausibly explained in a model with dust producing planetesimals located just interior the break , with stellar radiation ( and possibly also a stellar wind ) creating a radial gradient in grain size @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the extended halo of emission along the disk plane would be dominated by a population of small grains blown out onto highly elliptical or hyperbolic orbits , possibly with temperatures above the local blackbody values , that cover a large area on the sky and give rise to the fraction of millimeter emission missed by the interferometer .",
    "one implication of the multi - component emission structure is that the far - infrared to millimeter spectral index of @xmath59 indicated by the integrated spectrum @xcite may not be representative of any of the individual components .",
    "depending on the details , it is possible , for example , that the belt component could show a steeper spectral index that would be closer to expectations for a steady - state collisional cascade , without resorting to unusual fragmentation prescriptions or wavy grain size distributions @xcite .",
    "until multi - wavelength observations are available in this regime that clearly resolve the relevant structures , it will be problematic to use the integrated spectral index to make conclusive inferences about the grain properties and size distributions .",
    "the 1.3  millimeter image of the dust belt around @xmath0  pictoris sets the stage for much improved future observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , now under construction in chile ( and much better placed for aperture synthesis observations of this southern source ) .",
    "more detailed millimeter images have the potential to determine , e.g. if the dust belt center is offset from the star , or if the emission exhibits pericenter glow or other asymmetries that could point to dynamical perturbations from additional planets in this remarkable system ."
