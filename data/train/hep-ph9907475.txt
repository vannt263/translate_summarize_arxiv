    "although since the event of quantum chromodynamics we do have a renormalisable quantum field theory at hand to describe the interaction of quarks and gluons , we still have to face the fact that there is no rigorous analytical explanation for the confinement of those partons in hadrons . for the investigation of the properties of hadron structure we mainly rely on the information extracted from experimental data on hard scattering processes in form of distribution and fragmentation functions , which can be compared to the predictions of different models . a complete calculation of these objects from first principles , as for instance in lattice gauge theory , is not yet available .",
    "there are three fundamental quark distribution functions ( df ) contributing to a hard process at leading order in an expansion in powers of the hard scale @xmath0 : the momentum distribution @xmath1 , the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath2 , and the transversity distribution @xmath3 .",
    "whereas @xmath1 and @xmath2 are experimentally rather well measured , presently the transversity distribution @xmath3 is still completely unknown .",
    "the reason is that it is a chiral - odd object and needs to be combined with a chiral - odd partner to form a ( chiral - even ) cross section . as such",
    ", it is not measurable , for instance , in totally inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "together the three fundamental df characterize the state of quarks in the nucleon with regard to the longitudinal momentum and to its spin to leading power in @xmath0 .",
    "the inclusion of effects related to the transverse momentum of quarks inside the nucleon , and/or to subleading orders in @xmath0 , results in a larger number of df  @xcite . in particular , so called naive time - reversal odd ( for sake of brevity `` t - odd '' ) df arise , in the sense that the constraints due to time - reversal invariance can not be applied because of , e.g. , soft initial - state interactions  @xcite , or chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , or so - called gluonic poles attributed to asymptotic ( large distance ) gluon fields  @xcite .",
    "these df can describe also a polarization of quarks inside unpolarized hadrons .",
    "information on hadronic structure , complementary to the one given by the df , is contained in quark fragmentation functions ( ff ) describing the process of hadronization . to leading order ,",
    "those functions give the probabilities to find hadrons in a quark .",
    "experimentally known for some species of hadrons is only @xmath4 , the leading spin - independent ff , which is the direct analogue of @xmath1 .",
    "the basic reason for such a poor knowledge is related to the difficulty of measuring more exclusive channels in hard processes ( such as , e.g. , semi - inclusive dis ) and/or collecting data sensitive to specific degrees of freedom of the resulting hadrons ( transverse momenta , polarization , etc .. ) .",
    "however , a new generation of experiments ( including both ongoing measurements like hermes and future projects like compass or experiments at rhic or elfe ) will have a better ability in identifying final states and will allow for the determination of more subtle effects .",
    "in fact , when partially releasing the summation over final states several ff become addressable which are often related to genuine effects due to final state interactions ( fsi ) between the produced hadron and the remnants of the fragmenting quark  @xcite . in this context , `` t - odd '' ff",
    "naturally arise because the existence of fsi prevents constraints from time - reversal invariance to be applied to the fragmentation process  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of such an investigation can be demonstrated by considering the so - called collins effect  @xcite , where a specific asymmetry measurement in the leptoproduction of an unpolarized hadron from a transversely polarized target gives access to @xmath3 through the chiral - odd `` t - odd '' fragmentation function @xmath5 , which describes the probability for a transversely polarized quark to fragment into an unpolarized hadron .",
    "the presence of fsi allows that in the fragmentation process there are at least two competing channels interfering through a nonvanishing phase .",
    "however , as it will be clear in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , this is not enough to generate `` t - odd '' ff . a genuine difference in the lorentz structure of the vertices describing the fragmentation processes",
    "is needed .",
    "this poses a serious difficulty in modelling the quark fragmentation into one observed hadron because it requires the ability of modelling the fsi between the hadron itself and the rest of the jet , unless one accepts to give up the concept of factorization .",
    "moreover , it was even argued that in this situation summing over all the possible final states could average out any effect  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this article we will discuss a specific situation in the hadronization of a current quark , namely the one where two hadrons are observed within the same jet and their momenta are determined . by interference of different production channels",
    "ff emerge which are `` t - odd '' , and can be both chiral even or chiral odd .    for the case of the two hadrons being a pair of pions the resulting ff",
    "have been proposed as a tool to investigate the transverse spin dependence of fragmentation .",
    "collins and ladinsky  @xcite considered the interference of a scalar resonance with the channel of independent successive two pion production .",
    "jaffe , jin and tang  @xcite proposed the interference of @xmath6- and @xmath7-wave production channels , where the relevant phase shifts are essentially known . in the forthcoming paper  @xcite",
    ", we will adopt an extended version of the spectator model used in ref .",
    "@xcite and will estimate the ff in the case of the pair being a proton and a pion produced either through non - resonant channels or through the roper ( @xmath8 mev ) resonance .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "as an example , we demonstrate in sec .  [ sec : xsections ] that asymmetry measurements in two - hadron inclusive lepton - nucleon scattering allow for the isolation of the `` t - odd '' ff making use of the angular dependences in the leading order cross section .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "let us consider the situation of a one - hadron semi - inclusive dis , where a quark with momentum @xmath7 and carrying a fraction @xmath9 of the target momentum @xmath10 absorbes a hard photon with momentum @xmath11 and then hadronizes into a jet which contains a leading hadron with momentum @xmath12 eventually detected ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the soft parts that link the initial hard quark @xmath7 to the target and the final hard quark @xmath13 to the detected hadron @xmath12 indicate the distribution probability of the quark itself inside the target and the transition probability for its hadronization , respectively .",
    "they are described by the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that may depend also on the initial and final spin vectors @xmath16 and contain a sum over all possible residual hadronic states ( symbolized by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the soft leading hadron can undergo fsi with the sorroundings . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] three symbols represent the three possible classes of models that could describe them .",
    "the dark blob indicates mechanisms ( at leading or subleading order ) that break the factorization hypothesis .",
    "the light blob represents interactions with the residual fragments .",
    "it is clear that this second class requires non - trivial microscopic modifications of the hadron wave function , in other words it requires the ability of modelling the residual interaction between the outgoing hadron and the rest of the jet in a way that can not be effectively reabsorbed in the vertex connecting the hard and the soft part .",
    "moreover , it was also argued  @xcite that the required sum over all possible states of the fragments could average these fsi effects out .",
    "the third symbol , the dashed line originating from the space - time point @xmath17 , represents the most naive class of models , where fsi are simply described by an averaged external potential . despite its simplicistic approach ,",
    "this point of view poses serious mathematical difficulties , because the introduction of a potential in principle breaks the translational and rotational invariance of the problem .",
    "one could introduce further assumptions about the symmetry properties of the potential to keep these features , but at the price of loosing any contribution to the `` t - odd '' structure of the amplitude , as it will be clear in the following .    as a pedagogical example ,",
    "let us consider the oversimplified and unrealistic situation where the detected hadron with mass @xmath18 and energy @xmath19 is not polarized and does not interact with the rest of the jet ; therefore , it is described by the free wave function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the free dirac spinor . in momentum space eq .",
    "( [ eq : freespinor ] ) reads @xmath22 the jet itself is replaced by a spectator system which , again for sake of simplicity , is assumed to be a structureless on - shell scalar diquark with mass @xmath23 and momentum @xmath24 in order to preserve momentum conservation at the vertex .",
    "all this amounts to describe the remnants of the fragmentation process with a simple propagator line @xmath25 for the point - like on - shell scalar diquark @xmath24 . then , ignoring the inessential @xmath26 functions , the function @xmath27 of fig .",

    "hermiticity implies that all @xmath30 amplitudes be real .",
    "since the outgoing hadron is described by a free dirac spinor , time - reversal invariance also implies @xmath32 , from which the usual convention in naming this amplitude _ time - odd _ ( or `` t - odd '' ) originates . combining the two constraints gives @xmath33 in agreement with the previous result deduced just by simple algebra arguments .",
    "this result holds true if in eq .",

    "these simple arguments show that , in order to model `` t - odd '' ff in one - hadron semi - inclusive processes without giving up factorization , one needs to relate the modifications of the hadron wave function to a realistic microscopic description of the fragmenting jet .",
    "oversimplified assumptions , as in the case of symmetric , mathematically handable , external potentials , can lead to misleading results .",
    "such a hard task suggests that a more convenient way to model occurrence and properties of `` t - odd '' ff is to look at residual interactions between two hadrons in the same jet , considering the remnant of the jet as a spectator and summing over all its possible configurations .",

    "this class of ff is interesting for several reasons : obviously , being ff the `` decay - channel '' partners of the distribution functions ( df ) , they can give information on the parton structure of hadrons that are not available as targets ; they are directly related to fsi and , therefore , give access to exploration of mechanisms for residual interactions inside jets ; finally , a subset of these ff is chiral odd and represents the needed partner to isolate the quark transversity distribution , which is required to complete the picture of the quark structure of hadrons at leading order but , at the same time , is presently completely unknown due to its chiral - odd nature .",
    "the presence of fsi allows that in the fragmentation process there are at least two competing channels interfering through a nonvanishing phase .",
