    "over the last decade , observational evidence has mounted that anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) belong to the same class of objects .",
    "most publications discuss these objects in the frame work of strongly magnetized neutron stars , dubbed magnetars @xcite .",
    "alternative interpretations exist including ` normal ' magnetized neutron stars with fall - back disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even quark stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we adopt the magnetar interpretation .",
    "magnetars are rotating neutron stars with surface magnetic field strengths of @xmath9 g , well above the critical field strength of @xmath10 g at which the cyclotron energy of an electron reaches the electron rest mass energy .",
    "they have long rotation periods @xmath11 ( in the range 212 s ) and large period derivatives @xmath12 ( @xmath13 s s@xmath14 ) .",
    "their soft x - ray ( @xmath1510 kev ) luminosities of @xmath16 erg s@xmath14 exceed the available rotational energy losses ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to sgr giant flares , sgrs and axps exhibit periods of high activity wherein radiative outbursts are accompanied by numerous short bursts of typical durations a few hundred milliseconds . in the context of the magnetar twisted magnetosphere model @xcite",
    ", the energy release is due to magnetic field re - arrangement which may be triggered by crustal deformation causing a glitch in their rotational timing behaviour .",
    "a distinct feature is the high non - thermal luminosity of the persistent emission of axps above 20 kev , first esthablished by @xcite with the discovery of pulsed hard x - ray emission up to 150 kev from axp 1e 1841 - 045 in supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 73 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity spectrum exhibits two peaks , one near 1 kev and the other above 100 kev ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the soft x - ray part of the spectrum below 10 kev and the hard x - ray part above 20 kev , both exhibit luminosities exceeding the spin - down power 1 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the spectra of the first component can be empirically described by a thermal black body ( bb ) plus a soft power - law ( index 2 - 4 ) model or two bb models , and more physically with resonant cyclotron scattering models @xcite .",
    "on the origin of the hard non - thermal persistent component above @xmath17 kev , however , no concensus has been reached .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this component is persistent and within the statistical errors of about 20% stable over years , possibly as long as a decade , in both total and pulsed fluxes and spectral shapes , as well as in pulse phase / shape .",
    "most recent attempts to explain these findings in the magnetar interpretation are by @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal component above 10 kev has also been discussed in the context of the fall - back disk model @xcite . in his latest work ,",
    "@xcite discusses how a `` starquake '' can cause convective motions in the crust which twist the magnetic field anchored to the surface , after which it gradually untwists , dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation . a current carrying bundle of closed field lines ( `` j - bundle '' ) is created above the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "part of the thermal x - rays emitted by the neutron star are upscattered by the inner relativistic outflow in the quasi - steady j - bundle , producing a beam of hard x - rays .    in this context",
    ", it is therefore of great interest to study the evolution of the observational characteristics of a magnetar before and after a glitch followed by a radiative outburst ; to study the spectral variations in the persistent steady and pulsed emissions in the soft and hard x - ray bands , as well as variations in pulse profile .",
    "sofar the decay from a radiative outburst could only be studied in detail for energies below @xmath0 10 kev , e.g. for 1e2259 + 586 @xcite , sgr 0501 + 4516 @xcite , sgr j1833 - 0832 @xcite , sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , sgr1833 - 0832 @xcite and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 @xcite . in this work",
    "we present the first study in which both the temporal and spectral characteristics at both soft and hard x - ray energies before and during a radiative outburst of a magnetar , 1e1547.0 - 5408 , have been derived .",
    "the x - ray source 1e1547.0 - 5408  was discovered by @xcite in an einstein hri observation .",
    "based on its x - ray spectrum and variability , @xcite discussed this source as candidate magnetar in a candidate supernova remnant ( g327.24 - 0.13 ) .",
    "subsequently , its period was discovered in the radio band by @xcite , making it the first magnetar of which the pulsation was not discovered at x - ray energies , and the second known radio - emitting magnetar after the transient xte j1810 - 197 @xcite . with the reported period of",

    "x - ray pulsations were first detected with xmm - newton by @xcite in a period of enhanced activity in 2007 .",
    "these authors concluded that the source was recovering from an x - ray outburst in between 2006 and 2007 .    on oct .",
    "3 , 2008 ( mjd 54742 ) 1e1547.0 - 5408  started a period of strong bursting activity detected by swift @xcite , and by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite . by the latter authors the source was dubbed sgr j1550 - 5418 , motivated by the hundreds of typical soft - gamma - repeater bursts .",
    "the bursting activity was accompanied by a radiative outburst which was also detected with rxte and chandra @xcite .",
    "@xcite used swift and @xcite rxte and chandra data to study the evolution of the pulse profile shape and the phase - averaged spectrum for energies below 10 kev during the outbursting activity .    the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) reported renewed extreme bursting activity starting on jan .",

    "furthermore , @xcite monitored the 2009 outburst with chandra , xmm - newton and integral over a period of two weeks after the onset , as well as with swift over a 1.5 year interval .",
    "finally , @xcite focussed on the 2009 outburst using swift xrt observations for energies below 10 kev addressing the persistent radiative evolution and a statistical study of the burst properties .    in this work we exploited the extensive data base of observations of 1e1547.0 - 5408  with rxte , integral and swift covering the 27 months from the onset of the bursting activities in october 2008 till january 2011 .",

    "recently published works on 1e1547.0 - 5408 of which the analyses were performed in parallel to our work , focussed primarily on the evolution of the ( pulsed ) emission below 10 kev in time intervals up to @xmath0 20 days after the outbursts in oct .",
    "2008 and jan .",

    ", we revealed in addition the creation of a new transient non - thermal pulse in the pulse phase distribution after the jan .",
    "2009 glitch , and could study the simultaneous evolution of the pulsed and total high - energy emissions , the latter being dominated by an unpulsed component ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "it is striking , that the spectrum of the pulsed emission from 2 kev up to 150 kev after the glitch is very similar to the shapes of the broad - band spectra of the persistent pulsed emissions of three axps , 1e 1841 - 045 , 4u 0142 + 61 and 1rxs j1708 - 40 @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal pulsed component ( 20150 kev ) of 1e1547.0 - 5408  reaches in the time interval 15101 days after the glitch ( rxte time segment-4 ; see table [ rxte_segments ] ) a flux of @xmath235 erg/@xmath21s ( see table [ pulsed_flux_tab ] ) and an ( isotropic ) luminosity of @xmath236 erg / s adopting the distance estimate of 3.9 kpc of @xcite , which is about 1.4 times the spin - down luminosity during that time segment .",
    "there are clearly two maxima in the luminosity distribution of the pulsed spectrum , one around 100 kev and one near 1 kev ( the maximum , likely due to a bb component , is reached below our energy interval ; earlier works did not address the spectra of the _ pulsed _ emission of 1e1547.0 - 5408  below 10 kev , nor above 10 kev ) .",
    "we also see a clear phase separation of @xmath0 0.3 between the soft - spectrum pulse and the hard non - thermal pulse , similar to the case of 1rxs j1708 - 40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , also the broad - band total spectrum is reminiscent of those measured for these three persistent axps .",
    "however , for 1e1547.0 - 5408  we are dealing with a transient / variable phenomenon above ( and below ) 10 kev , while it was found that the non - thermal persistent emission of axps appeared stable within the statistical errors of @xmath0 20% over more than 10 years .",
    "the steadiness of the persistent non - thermal emission from axps led @xcite to reconsider his scenario s proposed earlier to explain the production of this non - thermal component @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , he discusses how a starquake can cause convective motions in the crust which twist the external magnetic field anchored to the surface .",
    "the magnetic twist energy is dissipated over time in the form of radiation , but the untwisting occurs in a peculiar way leading to the creation of a bundle of electric currents , the so - called j - bundle , which shrinks toward the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "the high - energy component , created by upscattering of thermal x - rays from the neutron star surface by an inner relativistic outflow in the quasi - steady j - bundle , is beamed along the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "the latter can explain the relatively narrow high - energy pulses .",
    "furthermore , his radiative - transfer simulations produce spectral shapes that get close to those observed , but with possibly too high break energies near 1 mev .",
    "it is very interesting to note that a radiative outburst accompanied by a strong glitch in the case of 1e1547.0 - 5408  indeed led to a scenario / geometry which mimics in many respects the observational characteristics of the persistent emission seen from axps .",
    "but our results on 1e1547.0 - 5408  pose several new observational constraints on this model scenario , as well as on other theoretical attempts ( none of the other models addresses the transient hard x - ray ( @xmath237 kev ) phenomenon of the persistent emission ) .",
    "a constraint on the time scale of creation of the quasi - steady narrow j - bundle , is the delay with respect to the glitch epoch of @xmath222 days , with which the high - energy pulse with non - thermal spectrum was created .",
    "another important finding is that the total non - thermal high - energy emission was present immediatly in the first integral observation starting 2 days after the glitch .",
    "this suggests that there should be a `` corona '' around the neutron star in which non - thermal unpulsed emission is produced without delay already at the start of the outburst .",
    "the model scenario of @xcite was proposed to explain the steady non - thermal emission from axps .",
    "what we find is a transient pulsed component which decays by a factor @xmath238 , becoming undetectable @xmath223 days after the glitch .",
    "however , the non - thermal total ( pulsed+unpulsed ) emission decayed only by a factor @xmath228 over more than a year , seemingly stable over the last @xmath0 100 days .",
    "a possibility is that a steady state similar to that of persistent emission of the above mentioned axps was reached after about one year , but that the pulsed non - thermal emission has become too weak to be detectable with currently operational high - energy instruments .",
    "the situation might be representative for all those axps for which no non - thermal emission has been detected ( yet ) , but all have x - ray fluxes in the transition region around 10 kev that also are weaker than detected for the axps with reported steady non - thermal persistent emission above 20 kev up to @xmath73 kev . in this respect , we like to note that 1e1547.0 - 5408  was in the field of view of integral during revolutions 470572 ( aug .",
    "21 , 2006  june 22 , 2007 ) for an effective exposure of 227.2 ks during a period in which the soft x - ray flux state increased at least @xmath239 its historical flux minimum reached in july ",
    "august 2006 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the source was then recovering from an x - ray outburst in between august 2006 and june 2007 .",
    "however , we did not find evidence for an outburst of non - thermal emission above 20 kev from 1e1547.0 - 5408  in the integral isgri sky maps .",
    "the @xmath89 upper limits to the flux measurements are at the level of the positive flux measurements in revs , 899912 ( around march 2010 ) in fig.[totspc_evol ] , but still significantly higher than the low flux upper limits from the very deep summed exposure before 2006 ( revs .",
    "46411 in fig.[totspc_evol ] ) .",
    "also in this case we can not exclude the scenario proposed by @xcite , because the total and particularly pulsed emission from axps and also from sgrs is ( too ) weak for easy detection by presently operational instruments .",
    "we noted the importance of studying the characteristics of magnetars over a broad energy interval . in the case of 1e1547.0 - 5408",
    "we concluded that discusssions based on spectral model fits to the narrow energy range 110 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads to apparent characteristics ( e.g. power - law component with spectral softening with decreasing flux ) which have to be revised when the broad energy range is considered , including the hard x - rays ( power - law component with spectral hardening with decreasing flux ) .",
    "furthermore , broad - band studies of the magnetar class are now becoming possible , as has been published by @xcite using suzaku observations of a sample of eight magnetars , including 1e1547.0 - 5408  in outburst . in that paper",
    "interesting correlations have been studied for the total emission of the hardness ratio , defined as the ratio of the flux of the hard , non - thermal component ( power - law fit ; 160 kev ) and the flux of the soft component ( a black body , a comptonized black body or a combination of the two ; 160 kev ) with derived characteristics as e.g. characteristic age and magnetic field strength .",
    "such a study ignores , however , that the origins of the actual unpulsed and pulsed emissions appear to be different ( location in the magnetosphere , production scenario ) as is evidenced by the different spectra of the pulsed and total ( pulsed+unpulsed ) emissions ( particularly above 10 kev ) , the different pulse profiles ( shape and phase ) for soft and hard pulsed components , and the different evolutions of all contributing components .",
    "theoretical modelling of the physics taking place under the extreme conditions in magnetospheres of magnetars is extremely complex .",
    "it is encouraging that the amount and detail of observational constraints is increasing significantly over the last years .",

    "<S> the magnetar 1e1547.0 - 5408  exhibited outbursts in october 2008 and january 2009 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present in great detail the evolution of the temporal and spectral characteristics of the persistent _ total _ and _ pulsed _ emission of 1e1547.0 - 5408   between @xmath01 and 300 kev starting in october 3 , 2008 , and ending in january 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed data collected with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ , the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ and the _ swift _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we report the evolution of the pulse frequency , and the measurement at the time of the onset of the january 2009 outburst of an insignificant jump in frequency , but a major frequency derivative jump @xmath1 of @xmath2 hz / s ( @xmath3 of @xmath4 ) . before this @xmath5 glitch , </S>",
    "<S> a single broad pulse is detected , mainly for energies below @xmath0 10 kev . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , @xmath0 11 days after the glitch a new transient high - energy ( up to @xmath0 150 kev ) pulse appears with a gaussian shape and width 0.23 , shifted in phase by @xmath0 0.31 compared to the low - energy pulse , which smoothly fades to undetectable levels in @xmath0 350 days . </S>",
    "<S> we report the evolution of the _ pulsed _ emission spectra . for energies </S>",
    "<S> 2.510 kev all _ pulsed _ spectra are very soft with photon indices @xmath6 between -4.6 and -3.9 . for @xmath0 10150 </S>",
    "<S> kev , after the @xmath5 glitch , we report hard non - thermal _ pulsed _ spectra , similar to what has been reported for the persistent pulsed emission of some anomalous x - ray pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> this pulsed hard x - ray emission reached maximal luminosity 70@xmath730 days after the glitch epoch , followed by a gradual decrease by more than a factor 10 over @xmath0300 days . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics differ from those of the _ total _ emission . both , the _ total _ soft x - ray ( 110 kev ) and hard x - ray ( 10150 kev ) fluxes were maximal already two days after the 2009 january outburst , and decayed by a factor of @xmath83 over @xmath0400 days . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> total _ spectra can be described with a black - body ( kt values varying in the range 0.570.74 kev ) plus a single power - law model . </S>",
    "<S> the photon index exhibited a hardening ( @xmath0 - 1.4 to @xmath0 - 0.9 ) with time , correlated with a decrease in flux in the 20300 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these findings in the framework of the magnetar model . </S>"
