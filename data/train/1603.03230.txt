    "the detector tracking system consists of the cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) and double - layer cylindrical multi - wire proportional z - chamber , both used for a trigger , and both are installed inside thin ( 0.2 @xmath14 ) superconducting solenoid with 1.3 t field .",
    "dc contains 1218 hexagonal cells and allows to measure charged particle momentum with 1.5 - 4.5@xmath15 accuracy in the 100 - 1000 mev / c range , and provides the measurement of the polar ( @xmath16 ) and azimuth ( @xmath17 ) angles with 20 mrad and 3.5 - 8.0 mrad accuracy , respectively .",

    "the energy behavior as well as the absolute value ( @xmath35 ) is predominantly due to pions polar angle selection criterion .",

    "we observe good data - mc agreement for the charged pion detection inefficiency ( @xmath53 ) , introduce no efficiency correction , and estimate uncertainty in the detection as 0.5% . by variation of corresponding selection criteria we estimate uncertainty due to the data - mc difference in the angular and momentum resolutions as 0.4% , and other selection criteria contribute 0.5% .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath54 cross section is dominated by not exact knowledge of angular acceptance of kaons . this systematic uncertainty ( 3% )",

    "unlike pions in neutral channel the charged pair of kaons have much more ionization losses and collinear configuration that leads to strong correlation in detector response to charged kaons tracks .",
