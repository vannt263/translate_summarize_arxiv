    "the baryon density of the universe and its ratio with respect to the dark matter is fixed by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite to a fraction of @xmath2 .",
    "however this ratio is smaller by a factor of 2 or 3 in galaxies and cluster of galaxies .",
    "this is known as the missing baryon problem @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the missing baryons are in intergalactic medium in diffuse warm - hot plasma which is hard to detect in x - ray or / and they are not in virialized gravitationally bound objects and resides in voids and filaments @xcite .",
    "also there is an idea that a considerable amount of missing baryon could be in cold transparent molecular clouds , which can be detected via optical scintillation method @xcite .",
    "the search for the missing baryons is one of the ambitious quests of cosmology , which will shed light on the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one of the promising cosmological probes to address this problem is the study of the galaxy clusters as the largest gravitationally bound systems .",
    "it seems that the galaxy clusters less suffer from the missing baryon problem than the other structures , however they are very valuable structures in universe to check the consistency of the universal baryon fraction @xcite",
    ". we can learn about the physics of baryons in galaxy clusters by studying the interaction of the galaxy cluster with cmb photons . although less than one percent of the cmb photons passed through the galaxy clusters but the physics of the interaction is known and under control .",
    "the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by hot intra - cluster gas of electrons change the intensity of the observed cmb .",
    "this effect is known as sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "the bulk motion of the galaxy cluster also introduce a doppler shift effect on the cmb photons known as kinetic sunyaev zeldovich ( ksz ) effect @xcite .",
    "the ksz is a physical processes of electron - photon scattering which keeps the cmb spectrum almost unchanged , while the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) is a process that changes the cmb spectrum .",
    "we should note that for a typical cluster of galaxies the thermal velocities are higher than the bulk velocity and accordingly ksz amplitude is an order of magnitude smaller than the tsz .",
    "thermal sz is observed via cmb temperature @xcite and also from individual cluster studies@xcite .",
    "the ksz is more challenging to be detected because of the smaller amplitude and also the fact that it does not change the spectrum of cmb . despite to its observational challenges , ksz is a very valuable quantity to be measured in clusters where it can be used to address some astrophysical questions like missing baryon problem @xcite and also some cosmological questions like the study of the growth of structures to constrain dark energy and modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that there is a frequency band in cmb observations @xmath3ghz where the tsz change on the cmb is almost zero . the first detection of ksz is reported by hand et al .",
    "( 2012 ) @xcite used the correlation of the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) data @xcite with the pair - wise velocity of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) spectroscopic catalogue @xcite .",
    "the ksz signal is also detected in planck and sloan data@xcite , south pole telescope and dark energy survey cross correlation as well @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we propose a novel idea to measure the baryon fraction in cluster of galaxies by using the ksz effect .",
    "the temperature change due to the ksz is proportional to the baryon fraction and the bulk velocity . in the case",
    "if we can find out the bulk velocity of the galaxy cluster then we can pin down the baryon fraction more accurately by adding the cmb - ksz information .",
    "the main idea of this work is centered on the bulk velocity measurement .",
    "the bulk velocity is usually measured by using the x - ray catalog of clusters as a complimentary probe to ksz @xcite or it is obtained via reconstructed matter density field @xcite . in this direction",
    "we suggest to use standard candles such as supernova ( sne ) type ia to measure the bulk velocity .",
    "traditionally sne ia used as a probe of cosmic bulk flow @xcite . in this work",
    "we assume that the sne resides in the brightest central galaxy of a cluster , accordingly this can be used as a probe of bulk velocity of cluster . finally adding up the two independent observations of ksz and sne ia , one can use it as a probe of baryon fraction in cluster .",
    "we also discuss the observational prospects of this proposal and the probability that this configuration can be observed .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows : in sec .",
    "( [ sec2 ] ) we discuss the theoretical framework of ksz . in sec .",
    "( [ sec3 ] ) we discuss the idea of measuring the peculiar velocity via sne type ia . in sec .",
    "( [ sec4 ] ) we discuss the observational prospects of the idea raised in this work and finally we conclude in sec.([sec5 ] ) .",
    "the temperature change in the cmb due to kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) is as below |_ksz()=- e^-()n_e(,)_e .",
    ", where @xmath4 is the mean cmb temperature , @xmath5 is the comoving distance which is a function of redshift @xmath6 , @xmath7 is thomson scattering cross section , @xmath8 is the optical depth , @xmath9 is the physical number density of free electrons , @xmath10 is the peculiar velocity of free electrons and @xmath11 is defined as the direction of the observation away from observer . note that the optical depth is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "( where @xmath13 is the physical length of the ionized patch in the sky ) . + this signal is an order of magnitude lower than the tsz and does not change the black body of cmb temperature .",
    "this signal is extracted from the cross correlation with the late time tracers of gravitational potential . in this framework the leading science is done by atacama cosmology telescope(act ) , which detect the ksz signal in correlation with the lss by correlating the ksz signal with reconstructed velocity field obtained for the galaxies from baryon acoustic oscillation sky survey ( boss)@xcite . in a standard way of thinking about the ksz effect , it seems that the signal on cmb plus our knowledge on properties of galaxy cluster can be used to obtain the peculiar velocity of the free electrons .",
    "now let us look to this problem in another point of view , if we can find the peculiar velocity of the galaxy cluster from an independent way , then we can use the ksz signal to extract the information about the baryon fraction in a cluster of galaxies .",
    "one way to reconstruct the peculiar velocity is by the linear perturbation theory , the semi - local density contrast can be used as a probe of peculiar velocity by using the euler equation @xcite .",
    "the other method is to use the standard candles like sne type ia to extract the information .",
    "we will discuss this method extensively in sec.([sec3 ] ) .",
    "+ in what follows we reexpress the ksz signal in terms of two contributions : a ) the physics of baryons , b ) the physics of peculiar velocity . with this point of view",
    "we write the physical number of electrons @xmath9 as n_e|n_e , where @xmath14 is the cosmic background number density of electrons and @xmath15 is the electron density contrast which is in order of @xmath16 for a virialized cluster . the background number density of electrons can be expressed in terms of cosmological parameters as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean gas density in redshift z , @xmath19 is the proton mass and @xmath20 is the effective number of electrons per nucleon .",
    "accordingly @xmath21 is the mean mass per electron .",
    "@xmath22 is the ionization fraction which depends on the temperature of the cluster and it is defined as @xmath23/ ( 1- y_p /2)$ ] , where @xmath24 is the primordial abundance of helium and @xmath25 is the number of ionized electrons corresponding to helium atoms .",
    "now we can relate the gas density to the baryon fraction of universe and matter density of universe as below [ eq : rhogas ] _",
    "g = f_g f_b _ m ( 1+z)^3 , where @xmath26 is the gas fraction of baryons in a cluster and @xmath27 is our crucial parameter of the study , known as baryon fraction parameter .",
    "@xmath28 is the matter density parameter and @xmath29 is the hubble parameter both defined in present time .",
    "now by assuming that the evolution of all above parameters inside a cluster is negligible and position independent , the ksz effect will become @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the size of the cluster numbered @xmath32 .",
    "the superscript @xmath32 indicate the cluster s i d . and",
    "now by using eq.([eq : nbar ] ) and eq.([eq : rhogas ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the signal can be written as @xmath34\\times   ( \\vec{\\beta}^i . \\hat{n}),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a specific parameter for each cluster , which depends on the mean redshift , the physics of intra - cluster medium and the line of sight length of the cluster as @xmath36 now @xmath35 can be written in the terms of cluster s gas fraction , ionization factor and line of sight length [ eq : ci ] c_i ( z_i ) 4 10 ^ -3 _ m h^2(1+z_i)^3 f_g .",
    "finally , we can define a parameter @xmath37 for each cluster , which encapsulates in it the physics of baryonic matter and it is related to ksz temperature change and the bulk flow of the cluster as below @xmath38 where the approximation works for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this means that by knowing the temperature change of the cmb due to the ksz effect and the peculiar velocity measurement by an independent method we can constrain the physics of free electrons and baryon fraction in a cluster . in the next section we will discuss that , how sne type ia will be a great candidate in order to calculate the bulk flow parameter .",
    "in this section we will discuss how standard candles can be used to determine the peculiar velocity of the structures .",
    "the idea is straightforward , the standard candles are used to establish a luminosity distance - redshift relation for a given background cosmology model .",
    "however the deviation from the homogenous background will change this relation .",
    "one of the important modifications is due to the peculiar velocity of the host galaxy of a sne , which affects both the luminosity and redshift of the standard candle .",
    "accordingly , we can use the deviation of the luminosity distance of the sne ia as a probe of peculiar velocity . + for this task , we assume that we are living in a perturbed frw universe with a newtonian comoving gauge chosen metric ds^2=a^2 ( ) , where @xmath45 is the conformal time and @xmath46 is the scalar metric perturbation .",
    "we assume that the general relativity ( gr ) is the correct classical theory of gravity and the universe is filled with components that have no anisotropic pressure . in this perturbed universe ,",
    "the luminosity distance of a sne ia is corrected by the change in the space - time component of the light propagation induced by amount of the matter in line of sight ( sachs wolf effect and gravitational lensing ) .",
    "the luminosity distance is also corrected due to the peculiar velocity of the source and observer .",
    "this is formulated in an equation for luminosity change @xcite d_l(z_s,)=(1+z_s)(z_s ) , where @xmath47 is the luminosity distance of a supernova in observed redshift of @xmath48 and direction @xmath11 ( note that @xmath11 is unit vector in the direction of observer toward source ) .",
    "@xmath49 is the comoving distance in frw universe in the observed redshift .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is the correction due to peculiar velocity of source .",
    "the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the lensing convergence , sachs - wolf and integrated sachs - wolf correction terms .",
    "( this terms are defined and studied extensively in @xcite ) . in the redshift range of @xmath0",
    "the most contribution to the luminosity distance change comes from the peculiar velocity @xcite [ eq : dlkappav ] d_l(z_s,)|d_l(z_s)[1-_v ] , where @xmath54 is the background luminosity distance and @xmath50 is luminosity correction due to peculiar velocity @xcite defined as [ eq : kappav ] _",
    "v= - ( 1- ) ( _ s. ) , where @xmath55 is the hubble parameter and @xmath56 where ( @xmath57 is the peculiar velocity ) . in low and intermediate redshifts ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the term in parentheses is negative , accordingly the objects moving toward us ( @xmath59 ) introduce a @xmath60 where if we replace this in eq.([eq : dlkappav ] ) we will get a dimmer sne . in the other hand",
    "when the host of a standard candle is moving away from us ( @xmath61 ) , that introduces a @xmath62 and accordingly the source become brighter .",
    "these chain of conclusions are changed in higher redshifts .",
    ", scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the main idea of this work is that we can use sne for finding the peculiar velocity ( bulk flow ) of the galaxy cluster .",
    "before proceed further , we should numerate the velocity contributions to our specific case of study .",
    "the velocities which can be assigned to a snia explosion are : +  a ) the peculiar velocity introduced from the progenitor of the snia , b ) the peculiar velocity of the host galaxy due to the gravitational potential of the cluster and c ) the peculiar velocity due to the bulk flow of the galaxy cluster . in this work",
    "we are merely interested in bulk flow , accordingly in order to extract this term , which is the source of the ksz effect , we assume , that the host galaxy of the supernova is the one which is located in the center of galaxy cluster ( known as bright central galaxy ( bcg ) ) . the central galaxy assumption is needed , as we want to assign the bulk velocity of the galaxy cluster to peculiar velocity of the bcg .",
    "this means that bulk velocity of cluster , which is represented by free electron velocity is the dominant term in host galaxy s peculiar velocity calculations .",
    "this fact comes from the idea that the central bright galaxies reside in the minimum of the potential well of cluster and the peculiar velocity with respect to the center of the mass of a cluster is smaller than the total bulk motion of the whole system .",
    "we assert that main contribution to the luminosity change of a sn in bcg is due to the peculiar velocity of the bulk motion of the cluster .",
    "this configuration is schematically shown in fig.([fig : config ] ) .",
    "however we should keep in mind that the effect of sne ia s progenitor s velocity _ may _ have a very significant velocity offset with respect to the peculiar velocity of the bcg host galaxy .",
    "this offset is included as a source of noise in our estimation . keeping this in mind we proceed by assigning the velocity corrections of luminosity distance to the bulk flow .",
    "this can be done by the idea that the progenitor velocity introduce a gaussian error to the velocity estimation with the mean and a variance related to the dynamical mass of bcg .",
    "the mean and variance can be calculated by setting the velocity of the center of mass of a snia progenitor equal to the dispersion velocity inside a typical bcg using the fundamental plane relation of elliptical galaxies @xcite , for a specific example , we express the dispersion velocity in terms of metric magnitude @xcite as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the metric magnitude . in this work we set the mean velocity to @xmath65 with @xmath66 variance .",
    "now by using eq.([eq : kappav ] ) , we can find the line of sight normalized velocity as [ vlos ] ( _ s. ) = ( 1- 10^ /5 ) / _ v , where @xmath67 is the difference of the observed distance modulus and the one predicted from background cosmology of @xmath68cdm in the specific redshift of @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is a unique term which is independent of the local physics , instead it depends on the background cosmological parameters and the redshift of the supernova .",
    "note that @xmath70 is the normalized hubble parameter to its present value .",
    "now by using eq.([vlos ] ) we can calculate the line of sight velocity of a sn , then we can assign this to the bulk velocity of the galaxy cluster which is the host of the sn @xmath71 where superscript @xmath32 represent the host of a sn .",
    "now by this identification we can use eq.([eq : xex ] ) to extract the baryon fraction .",
    "this can be done because the rhs of this equation is fixed by two independent observation . as mentioned in introduction",
    "the peculiar velocity measurement can be done in different methods like velocity reconstruction with a galaxy field@xcite and can be cross - checked with the method presented here . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the observational prospects of finding the missing baryons by the method described in this work .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the observational prospects of the idea proposed in previous sections .",
    "in the first subsection , we use the data sample of union 2.1 in order to represent the logical path of extracting the bulk flow of the clusters from the data with assuming that each snia reside in a bcg . in the second subsection",
    "we discuss the error estimation for realistic and optimistic case for finding the baryon fraction and finally in the third subsection we present an estimate for the number of events that we anticipate in future surveys which are suitable for our case of study .      in this direction",
    "first we assume that all the sne data from the known catalog are a potentially plausible candidates for our proposal .",
    "it means that we assume that they are hosted by a central galaxy of the cluster .",
    "this is just an assumption to show the procedure that how we can extract the information about baryons in a cluster .",
    "accordingly , we use the union 2.1 sne sample @xcite to show the procedure .",
    "first of all we extract the peculiar velocity with the method describe in sec.([sec3])by assuming that the standard @xmath68cdm model with best parameters fixed by supernova data @xcite describe the cosmological flat background ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "we obtain the difference of distance modulus @xmath74 versus redshift for the sample of sne .",
    "note that @xmath75 is the distance modulus from the known background cosmology .     versus redshift is plotted for union 2.1 sample of sne ia in redshift range of @xmath76 with @xmath77 error bar .",
    "the red data points shows the sne that are consistent with background @xmath68cdm prediction ( or far off from peculiar velocity correction ( see the text ) ) .",
    "the black points are in @xmath77 tension with background prediction .",
    "low amplitude blue curves are obtained from linear theory and the high amplitude green curves are set by assuming a maximum velocity of @xmath78 for a typical cluster.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig.([fig : deltamu ] ) , we plot @xmath79 versus redshift for sn ia in redshift range of @xmath76 .",
    "as it mentioned , in this redshift range the peculiar velocity correction is the dominant effect in the luminosity change of the sne ia @xcite , where we neglect the contribution of weak lensing convergence and the sachs - wolfe effect . in fig.([fig : deltamu ] ) the red data points shows the sne data that are consistent with background @xmath68cdm predictions .",
    "the blue low amplitude solid curves represent the amount of correction that we expect from the peculiar velocity in linear regime .",
    "the linear regime velocity can be obtained via linear matter spectrum @xmath80 as : v^2_p ( z ) = p(k)w^2(kr(z))dk , where @xmath81 is the average linear velocity in window function with a comoving radius @xmath82 .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is the growth rate which for standard @xmath68cdm is equal to @xmath84^ { 0.55}$ ] ( note that @xmath85 is the normalized hubble parameter to its present value ) .",
    "the blue curves shows the prediction of standard model in perturbation level .",
    "the solid high amplitude green lines are obtained by assuming a maximum line of sight velocity of @xmath78 .",
    "the black points with their @xmath77 error - bars indicate that the chosen sne ia have a tension with background prediction as @xmath79 is not zero .",
    "however they are consistent by linear perturbation prediction or with a maximum velocity of @xmath78 for a typical cluster .",
    "accordingly we neglect the sne that are out of the region of green curves with considering their error - bars ( this set of sne are also plotted in red points ) .",
    "the tension with the background can be interpreted as the effect of the first order correction to the distance modulus due the fact that cosmological model deviates from homogenous - isotropic background . accordingly",
    "the black data points of sne , potentially , can be interesting candidates in order to use them to extract the line of sight velocity of their host galaxies . in this procedure",
    "we fix the background parameters by merely using the sne ia data , however we can fix the background cosmology by complimentary observations such as cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath86 sne ia data pass the mentioned criteria . in the next step ,",
    "we assign the deviation of the distance modulus change to the peculiar velocity of the host galaxies .",
    "reasonably , the next step is to find the line of sight ( @xmath87 ) velocity of each sne .    ) is plotted versus redshift for the sne of the union sample which are in @xmath77 tension with the prediction of background cosmology .",
    "the horizontal solid black lines shows the typical maximum velocity of galaxy clusters @xmath88 .",
    "this plot is obtained for realistic and optimistic errors on sne luminosity distance measurement .",
    "the uncertainty due to the progenitors are the same in considered cases.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig.([fig : betta ] ) , we use eq.([vlos ] ) to extract the line of sight velocity .",
    "accordingly , we plot the @xmath87 of those sne that are in @xmath77 tension with background cosmological model versus redshift and are in the range of reasonable velocities .",
    "the error bars are obtained from the propagation of the error in distance modulus and also an error is added due to the velocity of sne progenitors . for this task",
    "we use a monte - carlo method to add a gaussian error with a mean of @xmath89 and a @xmath66 variance . the very interesting point to indicate here is that the sne that seems brighter ( @xmath90 ) moves away from us @xmath91 .",
    "this observation is consistent to the argument we made before for peculiar velocity effect in low redshifts . in fig.([fig : betta ] ) , we also obtained the peculiar velocity with an optimistic resolution .",
    "the blue small error - bar data come from the assumption that the _ relative _ error - bars of distance modulus in the optimistic case become half the realistic relative error that we have from the union sample @xmath92 .",
    "this plots shows that how the accuracy in snia luminosity distance measurement are important in this study .",
    "+ in order to find out about the baryon fraction , now by knowing the ksz temperature change for each galaxy cluster , we can find the baryon fraction keeping in mind that each snia galaxy host is the bright central galaxy of cluster under investigation .",
    "then with this assumption we can find the baryon fraction with the relation below : [ eq : fb ] , where @xmath93 obtained from eq.([eq : ci ] ) and @xmath94 depends on the background cosmology .",
    "we should note that eq.([eq : fb ] ) is the key equation of our proposal .",

    "( [ eq : fb ] ) , which will introduce the uncertainty in baryon fraction calculation .      in this section",
    "we show a forecast simple error calculation , in order to discuss the different error propagations in baryon fraction calculation .",
    "this can be used to show the usefulness of the method and its capacity for future experiments . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the background cosmological model is fixed via other observations such as cmb and the errors on density parameters and hubble constant is much more smaller than the uncertainties in the physics of the cluster , supernova observations and ksz signal extraction .",
    "this means that the uncertainty in baryon fraction calculation can be written as ^2_f_b = ( ) ^2_ksz^2 + ( ) ^2 ^2_sn + ( ) ^2 ^ 2_c , where @xmath95 is the error in ksz signal from cmb analysis @xmath96 is due to sne ia uncertainties due to intrinsic magnification errors and due to peculiar velocity of the sne ia progenitors and @xmath97 is related to the physics of the clusters .",
    "we also assume that errors from different contributions are uncorrelated and gaussian distributed , which is almost a reasonable assumption .",
    "for ksz the main problem is that the spectrum has almost a flat power in frequency range , that is why the primordial cmb anisotropies themselves are the most important source of contamination .",
    "accordingly most of ksz extraction methods try to separate the cluster signal of ksz and primordial anisotropies .",
    "regarding the angular resolution the galaxy cluster is of the order a few arc - minutes which is related to the angular moment of @xmath98 .",
    "this is a good news since the primordial cmb anisotropies are damped for large moments . accordingly a proper filter can separate the two signals . in a realistic error estimation ,",

    "with all this complicated physics which is governing the snia rate relation with the host galaxy , we set the conservative rate of @xmath134 .",
    "+ a project like large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) which is designed to operate for 10 years starting from 2019 and will capable of spanning the @xmath135 square degree of the sky ( which means @xmath136 ) in 6 optical bandwidth with a limited magnitude of to a total point - source depth of @xmath137 @xcite , we can estimate the @xmath138 with the conservative assumptions we made in this section . in another word in a very conservative point of view in lsst life time project",
    "we can estimate the baryon fraction of more than 30 clusters of galaxies .",
    "the distribution of the baryons in the universe is one of the main questions in cosmology , the big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background radiation independently fixes the baryon fraction .",
    "however the accessability of baryons in late time is a challenging task and it seems that there is a missing baryon problem out there .",
    "the galaxy clusters as the main reservoir of baryonic matter are filled with ionized electrons , also nowadays there is an indications that the baryonic matter can be spread out in non virialized objects .",
    "one of the promising venues to address the distribution of baryons in the sky is the study of thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect which are used as a probe of ionized gas in clusters . in this work",
    "we propose a new idea / method to measure the baryon fraction using the ksz effect and the sne - type ia as the standard candle . for this method to work",
    "we assume that a snia explodes in a bright central galaxy of a cluster .",
    "this is essential in a sense that the peculiar velocity of a bcg in a cluster can be used as an almost fair representative of the cluster s bulk flow .",
    "the bcg resides in the depth of gravitational potential of cluster and its velocity with respect to the center of mass of the system is almost zero .",
    "however in this work we indicate that the main uncertainty comes from the velocity of the sne ia s progenitor .",
    "accordingly we show that the sne ia in low redshift can be used to estimate the peculiar velocity of host galaxy . in the other hand",
    "the ksz effects on cmb temperature change depends on the baryon fraction and the bulk velocity of galaxy cluster .",
    "we assert that the deviation of a standard candle distance modulus from background prediction of the @xmath68cdm can be related to the peculiar velocity of snia host galaxy in lower redshifts , keeping in mind that the host galaxy is chosen to be a bcg .",
    "we showed that by knowledge of the peculiar velocity and the temperature change of cmb we can constrain the baryon fraction .",
    "we investigate the fisher forecast for the fiducial value of baryon fraction in the realistic ( current ) case and also in optimistic state .",
    "the analysis are discussed in the second subsection of sec.([sec4 ] ) . in the observational prospect part",
    ", we also study the possibility of the observation of this effect .",
    "we estimate that in a future large scale survey , like lsst which spans half of the sky in @xmath139 years , we can observe at least @xmath1 sne ia which explodes in a bcg in a cluster of galaxy .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the case of more statistics in galaxy cluster we can average the peculiar velocity of each host galaxy of snia , the average of squared velocity will be a representative of the bulk flow and the dispersion of velocities represent the error bar on bulk velocity .",
    "the story of the galaxy clusters with a bcg that host a snia can have another twist . in the case if we can pin down the properties of cluster like baryon fraction , the scale of a cluster and ... , then we can find the expanding rate of the universe via the proposal , that we made in this work encapsulated in @xmath140 which is related to physics we investigate here as : @xmath141^{-1}$ ] . as a final remark we want to insist that incorporating the sne ia that occurred in galaxy cluster with the sz effect can open up new horizons to study the physics of baryons and",
    "also can be used as a consistency check for our cosmological models .",
