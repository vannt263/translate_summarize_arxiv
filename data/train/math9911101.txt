    "let @xmath1 be a smooth rank@xmath10 distribution on a smooth manifold@xmath11 , that is a map that assigns smoothly to each point@xmath12 in@xmath11 a linear subspace @xmath13 of dimension@xmath10 .",

    "a goursat structure on a manifold @xmath17 of dimension @xmath18 is a rank two distribution @xmath1 such that , for @xmath19 , the elements of its derived flag satisfy @xmath20 , for each point @xmath21 in @xmath17 .",
    "goursat structures were introduced , using the dual language of pfaffian systems by e. von weber in 1898 .",
    "the first period of interest in this special class of distributions culminated in the work of cartan and goursat .",
    "a new period was initiated by giaro , kumpera , and ruiz at the end of the seventies .",
    "a renewal of interest in goursat structures has been observed from the mid of nineties .",
    "there are at least three reasons explaining those one century long studies .",
    "the first reason is that any goursat structure on @xmath22 can be locally converted ( on an open and dense subset , as it was observed only later by giaro , kumpera , and ruiz  @xcite ) into the so - called goursat normal form , also known as chained form : @xmath23{c}% \\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n}}% \\end{array } , \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% x_{n}\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n-1}}+\\cdots+x_{3}\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}}+\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}% \\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ] it seems that weber  @xcite was the first to exhibit this property and , indeed , goursat  @xcite attributes to him this result .",
    "in fact , the starting point of weber s studies was the following question : `` when is a given distribution equivalent to goursat normal form ? '' , which had led him to discover the concept of derived flag .",
    "this question is very natural because goursat normal form has a clear geometric interpretation .",
    "indeed , let us consider the space @xmath24 of @xmath25-jets of maps from @xmath26 to @xmath26 .",
    "on the one hand , a necessary condition for a curve in @xmath24 to be a prolongation of a graph of a function from @xmath26 to @xmath26 is that it is an integral curve of a distribution which , in the canonical coordinates of @xmath27 , is spanned by the goursat normal form on @xmath28 . on the other hand , a necessary and sufficient condition for a diffeomorphism of @xmath24 to map prolongations of graphs of functions into prolongations of graphs of functions is to preserve the distribution spanned by the goursat normal form on@xmath29 .",
    "such diffeomorphisms are called contact transformations  @xcite of order@xmath10 and have been intensively studied by bcklund  @xcite , and by lie and scheffers  @xcite .",
    "the second reason of interest in goursat structures has been the classical problem , first considered by monge , of integrating underdetermined differential equations ( equivalently , pfaffian systems ) without integration .",
    "to be more precise , let @xmath1 be a rank @xmath25 distribution on @xmath17 .",
    "the problem ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) is to find  @xmath25 smooth functions @xmath30 such that any integral curve @xmath31 of @xmath1 can be expressed as a smooth function of @xmath30 and their time - derivatives along @xmath31 . the most important achievement of the first period of studies on goursat structures was a result of e. cartan  @xcite , who showed that a rank two distribution posses the above described property if and only if it is transformable into goursat normal form .",
    "the third reason of importance of goursat structures is that they describe the nonholonomic constraints of many mechanical systems .",
    "for example , the kinematical constraints of a passenger car are described by a goursat structure on @xmath32 ; those of a truck by a goursat structure on @xmath33 . moreover , for goursat structures the nonholonomic motion planning problem can be solved explicitly ; either by transforming them into goursat normal form , as suggested by murray and sastry ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) , or by using the concept of flatness , introduced in control theory by fliess , lvine , martin , and rouchon , which is the above described property of calculating the trajectories without integration ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    as we said , the second period of studies on goursat structures began with a work of giaro , kumpera , and ruiz  @xcite , who observed that there are goursat structures which are not locally equivalent to goursat normal form .",
    "this observation raised the problem of classification of goursat structures and that of finding their invariants , and has led kumpera and ruiz to write their important paper  @xcite , where they gave a complete classification , up to dimension  @xmath34 , together with a set of general results on goursat structures .    in the nineties ,",
    "research on goursat structures was concentrated around two main topics : the classification problem and the nonholonomic motion planning problem for mechanical systems described by goursat structures . among results concerning the classification problem ,",
    "murray  @xcite obtained , using the concept of growth vector is the sequence defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] , for @xmath16 .",
    "the sequence @xmath37 is called the growth vector of @xmath1 at @xmath21 . ] , an easily checkable necessary and sufficient condition for a goursat structure to be equivalent to goursat normal form ( his condition simplifies those of libermann  @xcite and kumpera and ruiz  @xcite ) .",
    "cheaito and mormul  @xcite corrected the classification in dimension  @xmath34 ( see also @xcite ) and obtained a complete classification in dimension  @xmath38 .",
    "mormul  @xcite obtained a complete classification in dimension@xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that this dimension is the highest one in which there is a finite number of non - equivalent goursat structures .",
    "indeed , cheaito , mormul , and the authors  @xcite showed that in higher dimensions there are real continuous parameters in the classification .",
    "note , however , that in each dimension all goursat structures are finitely determined , which implies that there are no functional parameters in the classification .",
    "most of the work concerning mechanical control systems described by goursat structures has been motivated by the study of the @xmath9-trailer system .",
    "it would be impossible to give here a complete set of references on this subject .",
    "we have thus chosen to cite two books @xcite , and to give a few references concerning standard control theory problems for the @xmath9-trailer system and chained systems .",
    "the controllability of the @xmath9-trailer system has been proved by laumond both for regular  @xcite and singular  @xcite configurations .",
    "improved bounds for the nonholonomy degree of the @xmath9-trailer at singular configurations have been obtained by srdalen  @xcite , luca and risler  @xcite , and jean  @xcite . for regular configurations ,",
    "an explicit conversion of the @xmath9-trailer system into chained form has been obtained by srdalen   @xcite ; for singular configurations , an explicit conversion of the @xmath9-trailer system into kumpera - ruiz normal form has been obtained by the authors  @xcite ( see also section  [ sec - trailer ] ) .",
    "open loop motion planning has been investigated for general nonholonomic systems by brockett  @xcite , lafferriere and sussmann  @xcite , and liu  @xcite . for chained systems ,",
    "these results have been considerably simplified by murray and sastry  @xcite ( using the special properties of chained form ) and by fliess _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( using the concept of flatness ) . combined with the conversion of the @xmath9-trailer into chained form obtained by srdalen  @xcite , they have led to a solution of the nonholonomic motion planning problem for",
    "the @xmath9-trailer system ( see  e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "path tracking of non - abnormal open loop trajectories has been studied by fliess _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , jiang and nijmeijer  @xcite , and walsh  _ et  al . _",
    "since for chained systems constant trajectories ( points ) are abnormal , the proposed path tracking strategies can not be applied to achieve pointwise stabilization .",
    "indeed , the linearization of a chained system around such trajectories is not controllable .",
    "the first who observed the difficulties of pointwise stabilization for control systems without drift was brockett  @xcite .",
    "general algorithms for pointwise stabilization of nonholonomic systems can be found in the work of coron  @xcite , pomet  @xcite , mccloskey and murray  @xcite , and morin and samson  @xcite . for chained systems ,",
    "improved results have been obtained by samson  @xcite , srdalen and egeland  @xcite , and teel  _ et al . _",
    "these methods have been successfully applied to the @xmath9-trailer system ( see e.g. samson  @xcite , srdalen and wichlund  @xcite , and the references given there ) .",
    "our paper is devoted to a study of the geometry of goursat structures .",
    "we will introduce a new local invariant for goursat structures , called the singularity type , whose definition is based on the following observation .",
    "if @xmath1 is a goursat structure then each element @xmath4 of its derived flag contains an involutive subdistribution @xmath40 that has constant corank one in @xmath4 and is characteristic for @xmath41 .",
    "the singularity type reflects the geometry of incidence between the distributions @xmath4 and the distributions@xmath42 .",
    "although , as we prove , the singularity type keeps the same information about a goursat structure as the growth vector , that information is encoded in the singularity type in a much more systematic and , what is extremely important , in a much more geometric way .  in particular , the geometric information contained in the singularity type",
    "enables us to describe completely all abnormal curves of all elements of the derived flag .",
    "this can be summarized in the following theorem , which is a combination of theorem  [ thm - singularity - type - growth - vector ] and  theorem  [ thm - singularity - type - abnormal ] , and gives one of the main results of the paper .",
    "let @xmath1  and @xmath43  be two goursat structures defined on two manifolds  @xmath17  and  @xmath44 , respectively , of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "fix two points @xmath21  and @xmath45  of  @xmath17  and  @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the three following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the singularity type of @xmath1  at @xmath21  equals the singularity type of @xmath43  at @xmath46 .",
    "the growth vector of @xmath1  at @xmath21  equals the growth vector of @xmath43  at @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , between two small enough neighborhoods of @xmath21  and @xmath46  that transforms the abnormal curves of @xmath4  into the abnormal curves of @xmath49 , for each  @xmath50 .",
    "an important example that we will use to illustrate our results on goursat structures will be the @xmath9-trailer system , that is a mobile robot ( unicycle ) towing@xmath0 trailers . in the paper we will calculate rigid curves of the @xmath9-trailer and give their natural mechanical interpretation : they correspond to motions that fix the positions of the centers of at least two trailers .",
    "we will also show how to transform locally the @xmath9-trailer system into a kumpera - ruiz normal form , and we will prove a surprising result stating that any goursat structure is locally equivalent to the @xmath9-trailer system around a well chosen point of its configuration space .",
    "this result will enable us to use for any goursat structure a deep result of jean  @xcite devoted to singular configurations of the @xmath9-trailer system , in particular we will extend to all goursat structures jean s formula for the growth vector of the @xmath9-trailer system . in our work",
    ", the singularity type will replace the angles of the @xmath9-trailer system that appear in jean s theorem .    in the paper",
    ", we will propose an inductive procedure of constructing kumpera - ruiz normal forms of goursat structures based on two types of prolongations : regular and singular .",
    "this construction provides a systematic and unifying approach to many results of the paper .",
    "in particular , it will be used to show that any goursat structure can be brought to a kumpera - ruiz normal form ; to study generalized contact transformations , that is transformations which preserve goursat structures ; and to define the above mentioned transformations that transform locally the @xmath9-trailer system into a kumpera - ruiz normal form , and , conversely , that convert locally an arbitrary goursat structure into the @xmath9-trailer system around a well chosen point of its configuration space .",
    "recent studies ( see @xcite and @xcite ) show that most distributions are determined by their abnormal curves .",
    "our complete description of abnormal curves of goursat structures enables us to conclude that this is not the case of goursat structures .",
    "indeed , combining our study with the main theorem of  @xcite leads us to the following result : there exist two goursat structures @xmath1  and @xmath51  defined at @xmath21  and @xmath46 , respectively , that are not locally equivalent but for which there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , between two small enough neighborhoods of @xmath21  and @xmath46  that transforms the abnormal curves of @xmath4  into the abnormal curves of@xmath52 , for each @xmath50 ( see proposition  [ prop - r9 ] and proposition  [ prop - r11 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we introduce goursat structures , we give some examples in small dimension , and we define goursat normal form . in the second section , we provide an inductive definition of kumpera - ruiz normal form .",
    "the proposed concept of prolongations enable us to give a new proof of the kumpera - ruiz theorem , which states that any goursat structure can be converted locally into a kumpera - ruiz normal form .  in the third section",
    ", we introduce the @xmath9-trailer system and we construct transformations that bring locally the @xmath9-trailer system into a kumpera - ruiz normal form and , conversely , that bring an arbitrary goursat structure into the @xmath9-trailer system . in section four , we introduce our main invariant of goursat structures , namely , the singularity type .",
    "we also compute the singularity type for kumpera - ruiz normal forms and for the @xmath9-trailer system .",
    "as we have said , the singularity type keeps the same information about goursat structures as the growth vector although in both invariants that information is encoded in a different way .",
    "section five is devoted to study relations between these two invariants .",
    "in particular , we give a formula to compute the growth vector of an arbitrary goursat structure and another to compute the singularity type using the growth vector . in section six",
    "we study abnormal curves of goursat structures .",
    "we give a complete description of absolutely continuous abnormal curves for all elements of the derived flag of any goursat structure .",
    "we prove that the whole information about all abnormal curves is given by the singularity type .",
    "in section seven we study generalized contact transformations , that is transformations which preserve goursat structures ( also called symmetries ) and we give formulas to calculate them from first order contract transformations .",
    "those formulas are used to analyze examples of goursat structures that are non - equivalent but that have diffeomorphic abnormal curves .",
    "the paper ends with three appendices .  the first is devoted to a class of distributions that , although of rank greater than two , are very close to goursat structures .",
    "this class was also studied by e.  von weber . in the second appendix",
    "we construct a normal form which we use in our study of rigidity of integral curves of goursat structures .  finally ,",
    "in the third appendix , we illustrate through a set of figures different configurations of the @xmath9-trailer system corresponding to various kumpera - ruiz normal forms in dimensions@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and@xmath56 .",
