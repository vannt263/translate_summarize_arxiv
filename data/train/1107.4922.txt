    "modulation is a novel digital modulation concept for multiple  input  multiple  output ( mimo ) wireless systems , which is receiving a growing attention due to the possibility of realizing low  complexity and spectrally  efficient mimo implementations @xcite@xcite .",
    "the space modulation principle is known in the literature in different forms , such as information  guided channel hopping ( igch ) @xcite , spatial modulation ( sm ) @xcite , and space shift keying ( ssk ) modulation @xcite . although different from one another , all these transmission technologies share the same fundamental working principle , which makes them different from conventional modulation schemes : they encode part of the information bits into the spatial position of the antenna  array , which plays the role of a constellation diagram ( the so  called `` spatial  constellation diagram '' ) for data modulation @xcite .",
    "in particular , ssk modulation exploits only the spatial  constellation diagram for data modulation , which results in a very low  complexity modulation concept for mimo systems @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced in @xcite , @xcite and generalized in @xcite , respectively , an improved version of ssk modulation , which can achieve transmit ",
    "diversity gains without any spectral efficiency loss with respect to the original ssk modulation proposal .    in ssk modulation",
    ", blocks of information bits are mapped into the index of a single transmit  antenna , which is switched on for data transmission while all the other antennas radiate no power @xcite .",
    "regardless of the information message to be transmitted , and , thus , the active transmit  antenna , ssk modulation exploits the location  specific property of the wireless channel for data modulation @xcite : the messages sent by the transmitter can be decoded at the destination since the receiver sees a different channel impulse response on any transmit  to  receive wireless link . in @xcite and @xcite , it has been shown that the achievable performance of ssk modulation depends on how different the channel impulse responses are .",
    "in other words , the channel impulse responses are the points of the spatial  constellation diagram , and the receiver performance depends on the distance among these points .",
    "recent results have shown that ssk modulation can provide better performance than conventional modulation schemes with similar complexity if the receiver has perfect channel state information ( p  csi ) @xcite@xcite . however , due to its inherent working principle , the major criticism about the application of ssk modulation in a realistic propagation environment is the robustness of the space modulation principle to the imperfect knowledge , at the receiver , of the wireless channel . in particular , since the wireless channel is the actual modulation unit , it is often argued that the space modulation concept is more sensitive to channel estimation errors .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to shed light on this matter .",
    "although some research works on the performance of the space modulation principle with imperfect channel knowledge are available in the literature , these results are insufficient and only based on numerical simulations . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the average bit error probability ( abep ) of ssk modulation with non  ideal channel knowledge . however , there are four limitations in this paper : i ) the abep is obtained only through monte carlo simulations , which is not very much insightful ; ii ) the arguments in @xcite are applicable only to gaussian fading channels and do not take into account the cross  product between channel estimation error and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the receiver ; iii ) it is unclear from @xcite how the abep changes with respect to the pilot symbols used by the channel estimator ; and iv ) the robustness / weakness of ssk modulation with respect to conventional modulation schemes is not analyzed . in @xcite , we have studied the performance of ssk modulation when the receiver does not exploit the knowledge of the phase of the channel gains for data detection ( semi  blind receiver ) .",
    "the main message of this paper is that semi ",
    "blind receivers are much worse than coherent detection schemes , and , thus , that the assessment of the performance of coherent detection with imperfect channel knowledge is a crucial aspect for ssk modulation . a very interesting study has been recently conducted in @xcite , where the authors have compared the performance of sm and v  blast ( vertical bell laboratories layered space  time ) @xcite schemes with practical channel estimates .",
    "it is shown that the claimed sensitivity of space modulation to channel estimation errors is simply a misconception and that , on the contrary , sm is more robust than v  blast to imperfections on the channel estimates , and that less training is , in general , required by sm . however",
    ", the system in @xcite is studied only through monte carlo simulations , which does not give too much insights for performance analysis and system optimization .    motivated by these considerations , in this paper we aim at developing a very general analytical framework to assess the performance of the space modulation concept with coherent detection and practical channel estimates .",
    "our theoretical and numerical results corroborate the findings in @xcite , and highlight two important outcomes : 1 ) space modulation can be even more robust to channel estimation errors than conventional modulation schemes , and 2 ) the number of pilot symbols required to approach the lower  bound set by coherent detection with perfect channel knowledge is quite limited . more precisely ,",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows : i ) we develop a general analytical framework to compute the abep of the tosd ",
    "ssk modulation scheme with imperfect channel knowledge .",
    "the framework can handle arbitrary transmit  antenna , receive  antenna , fading channel statistics , and number of pilot symbols used by the channel estimation unit .",
    "it is shown that the mismatched detector of tosd  ssk modulation @xcite can be cast in terms of a quadratic  form in complex gaussian random variables ( rvs ) when conditioning upon fading channel statistics , and that the abep can be computed by exploiting the gil  pelaez inversion theorem @xcite ; ii ) we compare the performance of tosd  ssk modulation with the alamouti scheme @xcite , which similar to tosd  ssk modulation can achieve transmit ",
    "diversity equal to two , and show that tosd ",
    "ssk modulation is more robust to imperfect channel knowledge ; and iii ) we show that transmit and receive  diversity of tosd  ssk modulation with non ",
    "ideal channel estimates is always preserved .",

    "[ fig_r1][fig_r4 ] , we can observe , for various data rates , a very good agreement between monte carlo simulations and the analytical framework developed in section [ performance_analysis ] . by carefully analyzing these figures ,",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn : i ) tosd  ssk modulation is quite robust to channel estimation errors and only a limited number of pilots @xmath33 are needed to get performance very close to the p  csi lower  bound .",
    "in particular , we notice that , in the analyzed scenario , with @xmath133 there is almost no performance penalty ; ii ) the numerical examples confirm the diversity gain predicted in section [ apep ] , and we notice a steeper slope when increasing the number of antennas at the receiver .",
    "furthermore , the diversity gain is preserved for any number of pilot pulses , and , so , the quality of the channel estimates ; iii ) the performance of both tosd  ssk modulation and alamouti scheme gets worse for increasing values of the data rate , as expected ; iv ) tosd  ssk modulation is worse than the alamouti scheme when the data rate is low ( 1 bits / s / hz ) , it yields comparable performance for medium data rates ( 2 bits / s / hz ) , while it noticeably outperforms the alamouti scheme for high data rate ( 3 bits / s / hz and 4 bits / s / hz ) , while still keeping almost the same computational complexity .",
    "this confirms that tosd ",
    "ssk modulation is a good candidate for high data rate applications , and where the data rate can be increased by adding more antennas at the transmitter but still keeping only one of them active at any time instance ; and v ) the tosd ",
    "ssk modulation scheme is more robust to channel estimation errors than the alamouti scheme , which agrees with the results obtained in @xcite where sm is compared to the v  blast scheme .",
    "this result is very important and breaks with the misconception that the space modulation concept is inherently less robust to inaccuracies in the channel estimation because it maps data information on the impulse response of the wireless channel .",
    "more specifically , the relative robustness of tosd  ssk modulation with respect to the alamouti scheme can be quantitatively analyzed in table [ tab_1 ] , where we have ( approximately ) computed the snrs needed to get @xmath134 .",
    "for example , we notice that for tosd ",
    "ssk modulation the snr gap between the setups with p  csi and @xmath135 is approximately equal to 2db , while in the same scenario the snr penalty for the alamouti scheme is approximately 3db .",
    "furthermore , the higher robustness of tosd  ssk modulation to imperfect channel knowledge can be observed by carefully analyzing table [ tab_1 ] for a rate equal to 2 bits / s / hz . we observe that if channel estimation is perfect , the alamouti scheme is slightly better than tosd  ssk modulation .",
    "however , tosd  ssk modulation gets slightly better when @xmath135 .",
    "this example clearly shows the potential benefits of tosd  ssk modulation in practical scenarios with imperfect channel knowledge .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the performance of the space modulation principle when csi is not perfectly known at the receiver .",
    "a very accurate analytical framework has been proposed and it has been shown that , unlike common belief , transmission systems based on the space modulation concept can be more robust to channel estimation errors than conventional modulation schemes . furthermore , it has been shown that only few pilot symbols are needed to achieve almost the same performance as the reference scenario with perfect channel knowledge .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the sensitivity and robustness of space shift keying ( ssk ) modulation to imperfect channel knowledge at the receiver . unlike the common widespread belief </S>",
    "<S> , we show that ssk modulation is more robust to imperfect channel knowledge than other state  of  the  art transmission technologies , and only few training pilots are needed to get reliable enough channel estimates for data detection . more precisely , we focus our attention on the so  called time  </S>",
    "<S> orthogonal  signal  design ( tosd ) ssk modulation scheme , which is an improved version of ssk modulation offering transmit  diversity gains , and provide the following contributions : i ) we develop a closed  form analytical framework to compute the average bit error probability ( abep ) of a mismatched detector for tosd  ssk modulation , which can be used for arbitrary transmit  antenna , receive  antenna , channel fading , and training pilots ; ii ) we perform a comparative study of the performance of tosd  ssk modulation and the alamouti code under the same imperfect channel knowledge , and show that tosd  ssk modulation is more robust to channel estimation errors ; iii ) we point out that only few pilot pulses are required to get performance very close to the perfect channel knowledge lower  bound ; and iv ) we verify that transmit and receive  diversity gains of tosd  ssk modulation are preserved even for a mismatched receiver .    </S>",
