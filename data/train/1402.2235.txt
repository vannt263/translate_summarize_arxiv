    "<S> the independent predictions of edge ferromagnetism and the quantum spin hall phase in graphene have inspired the quest of other two dimensional honeycomb systems , such as silicene , germanene , stanene , iridiates , and organometallic lattices , as well as artificial superlattices , all of them with electronic properties analogous to those of graphene , but much larger spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> here we study the interplay of ferromagnetic order and spin - orbit interactions at the zigzag edges of these graphene - like systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find an in - plane magnetic anisotropy that opens a gap in the otherwise conducting edge channels , that should result in large changes of electronic properties upon rotation of the magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic anisotropy , a technologically crucial property , is driven by spin - orbit interaction , which is normally the underdog in the competition with the other two terms that control ferromagnetism , namely , kinetic and coulomb energy@xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic anisotropy energy in conventional ferromagnets is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the curie temperature and the fermi energies ( or the band - gap , in the case of insulators ) . for the same reason , </S>",
    "<S> transport properties in ferromagnetic metals are only weakly dependent on the magnetic orientation , and typical values for the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) are below 3 percent@xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study magnetic anisotropy in a class of systems for which the balance between these three energy scales is very different from the usual , which leads to two dramatic consequences , very different from conventional ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> first , the conducting properties change from metal to insulator , depending on the magnetization orientation , an effect that , to the best of our knowledge , has never been reported . </S>",
    "<S> second , the magnetic moment magnitude depends strongly on the magnetic orientation , and it can change even vanish in some directions , a phenomenon dubbed colossal magnetic anisotropy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the class of systems in question are the zigzag edges of two dimensional honeycomb crystals@xcite whose electronic properties can be described with a tight - binding model with a single orbital per site and kane - mele spin - orbit interactions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this includes several materials , such as group iv two dimensional crystals ( graphene@xcite , as silicene@xcite , germanene@xcite , and stanene@xcite ) , the double layer perovskyte iridates @xcite , and metal organic frameworks ( mof ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , given that the existence of non - dispersive edge states occurs at the zigzag edge of any system described with the dirac equation@xcite , the results discussed here should also be valid for the so - called designer dirac fermions formed in `` artificial graphene '' formed by decoration of two dimensional electron gases with honeycomb arrangements@xcite .    ignoring spin - orbit and coulomb interactions altogether , these 2d crystals are zero band - gap semiconductors with dirac - like dispersion close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> zigzag edges in these systems are known to host localized edge states that , when both coulomb and spin - orbit coupling are neglected , are non - dispersive , sub lattice polarized , and lie precisely at the fermi energy , at half - filling@xcite . the ensuing large density of states results in a stoner instability that leads to ferromagnetic order at the edge@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , kane - mele spin - orbit interaction , a second - neighbor spin dependent hopping that conserves the spin component @xmath0 perpendicular to the two dimensional crystal@xcite , has dramatic consequences in these honeycomb crystals . </S>",
    "<S> it opens a topologically non - trivial gap in bulk and the emergence of in - gap spin - filtered dispersive edge states : for a given spin projection @xmath0 , electrons propagate along one direction only , preventing back - scattering even in the presence of time - reversal symmetric disorder . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the slope of the edge bands is proportional to the kane - mele spin - orbit coupling , which controls thereby the density of states at the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of spin - orbit and coulomb repulsion on the otherwise non - dispersive edge states leads to the strong magnetic anisotropy effects anticipated above .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to model this kind of systems , we use the so called kane - mele - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite , which provides a minimal model to study the effect of the coulomb interactions on the topologically protected edge states : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the spin projections of the spin along the axis perpendicular to the to the two dimensional crystal , @xmath4 stands for first neighbor and @xmath5 for second , @xmath6 for clockwise or anti - clockwise second neighbor hopping @xcite .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the rashba coupling,@xcite . in the case of planar honeycomb systems , such as graphene , </S>",
    "<S> the rashba term is null . </S>",
    "<S> for buckled group iv crystals , such as silicene , germanene and stanene , the magnitude of the rashba is one order of magnitude lower than the pure spin - orbit.@xcite    the hubbard term reads : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the occupation operator of site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 along an arbitrary quantization axis . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the hubbard interaction in the collinear mean field approximation , enforcing the magnetization to lie along the axis @xmath11 , that we take as the quantization axis ( see fig.[f2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach permits to study solutions with different @xmath12 and compare their properties . </S>",
    "<S> rotations in the @xmath13 plane leave the results invariant , due to the symmetry of the kane - mele spin - orbit coupling . in general , the coulomb interaction term evaluated in the mean field approximation leads to two self - consistent potentials terms , direct and exchange . in the case of the hubbard model in the collinear approximation , </S>",

    "<S> notice as well that the @xmath19 term is non - diagonal when represented in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath20 and @xmath21@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we characterize the width of the ribbons by @xmath24 . for finite @xmath25 , and as long as @xmath26 is not too large , we find solutions with ferromagnetic order at the edges . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment calculated self - consistently is non - negligible only at the edge atoms . attending to their mutual magnetization orientation , </S>",
    "<S> ribbons yield two types of solutions with ferromagnetic edges : parallel ( fm ) and antiparallel ( af ) . for sufficiently wide ribbons </S>",
    "<S> the inter - edge coupling is negligible and both solutions have identical properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the first important result of the paper is shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas off - plane magnetization @xmath27 leads to a conducting solution , found in previous works@xcite , the in - plane magnetization opens a gap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , transport properties of zigzag edges will change dramatically upon rotation of the magnetization direction , in contrast with conventional metallic ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> this metal - insulator transistion will is developed as well in chiral edge ribbons @xcite , which have been widely reported @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second important result of the manuscript is shown in fig.[f2]b . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy @xmath28 is minimal for @xmath29 , i.e. , for in - plane magnetization , which means that spontaneous magnetic order in this system leads to insulating behavior .    . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath31 , u = t , @xmath1.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results of figure 1 can be understood as follows . in the absence of magnetic order , </S>",
    "<S> two spin - filtered in - gap edge states with opposite velocities exist at each edge@xcite , resulting in a two - fold degeneracy ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> ferromagnetic order with @xmath32 breaks time reversal symmetry but does not mix spins . </S>",
    "<S> thus , magnetic order merely yields a spin - dependent shift that breaks the two - fold degeneracy , as seen in fig.[f1]a , for the fm case . for the af configuration </S>",
    "<S> , there is an extra symmetry that restores the double degeneracy : the combined action of spatial inversion , that results in a exchange of the atoms of the two interpenetrating triangular sub lattices @xmath33 and @xmath34 that form the honeycomb , and time reversal , that exchange @xmath10 and @xmath35 , leave the system invariant . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spin @xmath10 band localized at the at the @xmath33 type edge is degenerate with the spin @xmath35 band localized in the opposite edge .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is radically different when the magnetization lies in plane . </S>",
    "<S> representing the self - content potential in the basis of the @xmath36 spin filtered edge states , with spin quantized along the @xmath37 axis , the effect of the in - plane magnetization is to mix bands with opposite spins . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a band gap opens at the @xmath38 point where the non - interacting edge bands cross . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the bands as the magnetization is rotated from almost off - plane ( left ) to almost in - plane ( right ) is shown if fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f2])(e , f ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that the band gap ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f2])(c ) ) is maximal for in - plane magnetization ( @xmath29 ) and null for off - plane @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the preference for in - plane magnetization can also be connected with the variation of the magnitude of the edge magnetic moment with @xmath12 ( fig.[f2]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two results naturally explain the fact that the ground state energy is minimal for in - plane magnetization . at half - filling , </S>",
    "<S> all the valence bands are occupied and the conduction bands are empty . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , increasing the band - gap decreases the total energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap opening as long as magnetization is not off - plane will certainly have dramatic consequences on the transport properties along the edges . </S>",
    "<S> a result similar to this has been obtained recently@xcite , using a kane - mele model where magnetic order is externally driven , and modeled by a magnetic exchange potential that arises from proximity rather than spontaneously , as discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of figures 1 and 2 are for a specific choice of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and for a ribbon with @xmath31 sites , wide enough to decouple the two edges . </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how the results depend , quantitatively , on the specific values of the spin - orbit coupling , ribbon width and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of several energy differences between af / fm and in - plane off - plane configurations , as a function of the ribbon width @xmath24 is shown in fig.[f3]a . for large @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that fm and af have the same ground state and anisotropy energy . </S>",

    "<S> attending to the difference between the magnitude of the magnetic moment in the off - plane and in - plane cases ( fig.[f3](e ) ) , three different regions are found . </S>",
    "<S> for very small @xmath42 the magnetic moment is the same for out of plane and in - plane magnetization and the magnetic anisotropy energy depends quadratically on @xmath42 . from this standpoint , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the zigzag edge is similar to conventional magnets , although a small gap , open for in - plane magnetization . for wide enough ribbons , the value of this gap is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bulk gap opened by spin - orbit interaction and @xmath45 is the exchange splitting gap , which is a decreasing function of @xmath46 , giving rise to the curve seen in figure [ f3](d ) .    </S>",

    "<S> increasing spin - orbit coupling beyond this point starts to reduce the band - gap and the magnetic order altogether , which leads to a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( fig.[f3](e ) )    we thereby expect that graphene , silicene and germanene are in the small @xmath42 region , mof is in the intermediate region and the stanene zigzag edge could show the colossal magnetic anisotropy effect . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in the intermediate region the magnetic anisotropy energy per magnetic atom can be extremely large . </S>",

    "<S> , we have studied the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic phase of the zigzag edges of graphene and graphene - like systems , that can be described with a single orbital hubbard model model on a honeycomb lattice with spin - orbit coupling described with the kane - mele hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this includes a large class of two dimensional crystals , such as silicene@xcite , germanene@xcite , stanene@xcite , iridates@xcite and metal organic frameworks@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the electronic dispersion of the non - interacting edge states is fully determined by the spin - orbit coupling , the resulting magnetic anisotropy effects , computed within a mean field approximation , turn out to be very strong : the system undergoes a metal to insulator transition when the magnetization is rotated out of the normal and for large values of @xmath46 the magnetic solutions are only stable for in - plane magnetization . for all values of the spin - orbit interaction </S>",
