    "this reflects the competition between the gains due to higher order pulse sequences and the losses due to the increased coupling time to the qubit allotted to the environment .",
    "similar conclusions , delineating regimes where increasingly long dd sequences become disadvantageous , have been reported for periodic @xcite and concatenated @xcite dd pulse sequences , as well as for the qdd sequence @xcite .",
