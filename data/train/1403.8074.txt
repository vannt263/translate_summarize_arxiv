    "recently , much attention has been paid to the problem of correlated disorder in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems ( see for example , ref .  [ ] and references therein ) . as is known , in 1d models with white - noise disorder",
    "all eigenstates are localized in infinitely large samples , independently on the strength of disorder @xcite .",
    "although this result , known as the anderson localization @xcite , was rigorously proved for continuous potentials long ago , one has to note that for the tight - binding and kronig - penney models the presence of discrete resonances do not allow to treat the problem of localization rigorously for any value of energy inside the energy bands .",
    "this fact leads to the failure of the single - parameter scaling ( sps)@xcite according to which all transport properties of finite samples depend on the ratio of the actual sample size to the localization length defined in the limit of infinitely large samples .",
    "on the other hand , the energy intervals where the sps fails are typically small and in real applications may be neglected .    as recently argued in refs .",
    "[ ] , outside the resonances the analytical results for the transmission coefficient and its variance , obtained for 1d continuous random potentials , can be safely used for tight - binding and kronig - penny models as well , provided the energy is not too close to the resonances .",
    "moreover , it was shown that with specific methods one can effectively modify the theory and describe the global properties of the transmission within the whole energy region , including the resonance regions @xcite .    for a long time",
    "the localization properties of weakly random potentials in the presence of correlations ( colored - noise potentials ) were discussed scarcely , in spite of the fact that the results developed for continuous 1d potentials have been obtained in the general form @xcite , allowing to analyze the influence of both short and long - range correlations ( see discussion in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "the interest in the problem of localization for colored - noise potentials has been triggered by numerical studies of discrete dimer models for which the onset of delocalization has been observed numerically @xcite .",
    "later it was understood that such delocalization emerging for discrete values of energies does not contradict the general statement of the theory of localization according to which delocalization is not possible for 1d disordered potentials . nevertheless , since in reality",
    "the size of disordered samples is always finite , one can speak about an _ effective _ delocalization within some intervals of energy .",
    "then , the coexistence of localized and delocalized eigenstates can be controlled by the specific choice of correlations .",
    "this non - trivial possibility to control localization properties due to specific correlations has led to intensive studies of anomalous transport properties in colored - noise potentials .",
    "one of the results of studies of tight - binding models with colored - noise disorder is the discovery that long - range correlations can lead to vanishing lyapunov exponent in a finite range of energy inside allowed energy bands @xcite .",
    "although this result is obtained for weak disorder in the first - order perturbation theory , one can speak about the emergence of effective mobility edges dividing the regions with localized and extended states .",
    "the theoretical predictions of arranging narrow energy windows with perfect transmission in a desirable range of energy has been experimentally confirmed in microwave experiments with point - like scatterers inserted into one - channel waveguides @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it was shown that with long - range correlations one can strongly enhance the localization even when the strength of disorder is weak @xcite .",
    "the important point is that such localization of eigenstates can be achieved in quite narrow energy regions , thus resulting in a strong selective reflection of scattering waves .",
    "both numerical and experimental results have demonstrated robust anomalous properties of scattering even in disordered samples of relatively small size .    it should be stressed that apart from specific colored - noise potentials that can be experimentally arranged , there are many physical situations where long - range correlations are not avoidable and have to be taken into account .",
    "one of such situations occurs in experiments of 1d optical lattices with interacting bosons ( see for example [ ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the problem of correlated disorder in 1d systems for which the theory is practically developed , the transport properties of q1d systems with colored noise are not well understood . among the setups studied in this direction one can mention the tight - binding anderson model with two - coupled chains @xcite , the models with stratified or _ layered _ disorder @xcite , and multi - mode waveguides with long - range correlations in surface profiles @xcite .",
    "the aim of this presentation is to contribute to the theory of correlated disorder in the q1d geometry .",
    "specifically , we consider the q1d model of the anderson type in correspondence with the results obtained in the theory of 1d disordered models . as the first step we analyze the situation for which the scattering potential has specific long - range correlations in the longitudinal @xmath0direction , however ,",
    "does not depend on the transverse @xmath1coordinate . as is shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , for such _ stratified _ disorder the problem can be solved analytically by the reduction of the q1d scattering problem to the analysis of the scattering along @xmath2 independent 1d channels .",
    "specifically , the independence of the disorder on the transverse coordinate allows one to reduce the model to a coset of non - interacting channels characterized by different localization lengths @xcite .",
    "note that since now the total conductance is a complicated combination of partial 1d conductances , the concept of the single parameter scaling is not valid @xcite .    in our study",
    "we explicitly show , both analytically and numerically , that long - range correlations in q1d wires with stratified disorder can produce a non - monotonic step - wise energy - dependent conductance .",
    "numerical data indicate that by introducing an additional white - noise disorder in the transverse direction the effect of long - range longitudinal correlations is strongly suppressed , however , it practically remains unaffected in the channel with the lowest index .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model of q1d wire and give basic relations for the characterization of scattering properties .",
    "specifically , we show how the transmission though q1d wires with stratified disorder can be explained in terms of the independent partial transmission coefficients corresponding to the 1d wires composing the q1d structure . in section iii",
    "we explain the approach according to which we numerically compute the scattering properties of the q1d correlated wires , based on an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian describing the scattering .",
    "then , we verify our analytical predictions by comparing them with numerical data , and show that for a special choice of the correlated disorder the conductance shows a highly unexpected step - wise energy - dependence . finally , in section vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "the model consists of a rectangular array of sites of length @xmath2 and width @xmath3 , with nearest neighbor couplings , see fig .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to this setup has the following form , @xmath4 the on - site entries @xmath5 are assumed to be random numbers whose statistical properties will be specified below , while the coupling amplitudes @xmath6 between sites are considered to be constant .",
    "the disordered wire is connected to semi - infinite tight - binding leads of width @xmath7 marked in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by open circles . in the leads , for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "the disorder is absent and the coupling amplitudes between the sites in the leads are also fixed to @xmath6 .     and width @xmath7 connected at both ends to semi - infinite ideal leads.,width=302 ]    the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation for the eigenstates @xmath10 of energy @xmath11 reads , @xmath12 without disorder , @xmath13 , the solution @xmath10 are plane waves with wave number @xmath14 in the transverse direction . in the following , the index @xmath15 is treated as the channel ( or mode ) number . in our model",
    "we assume zero boundary conditions in the transverse direction , @xmath16 , therefore , the dispersion relation takes the form , @xmath17    from this relation one can see that the @xmath18th channel is open as along as the energy fulfills the condition inside the interval @xmath19 and outside it @xmath14 becomes imaginary .",
    "in fact , the latter equation determines the number @xmath20 of open modes in dependence of the energy .",
    "for example , at the band center , @xmath21 , all modes are open and @xmath22 . while for @xmath23 all modes are closed .",
    "taking into account that @xmath24 for @xmath25 , one can obtain the expression for the number of open modes in terms of the energy and channel number @xmath26 , @xmath27",
    "in order to analyze transport properties of our model in what follows we use the _ non - hermitian hamiltonian _ approach ( see for example [ ] ) . the key point of this approach is based on the projection of the total hermitian hamiltonian @xmath28 ( disordered part plus leads , see eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) onto the basis defined by the hamiltonian @xmath29 describing the properties of the _ closed _ model ( only disordered part , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in this way",
    "the leads are considered as a continuum to which the disordered part is coupled according to given boundary conditions .",
    "the knowledge of the effective hamiltonian @xmath29 allows one to construct the scattering matrix and , as a result , all transport properties can be obtained .    for our model",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian expressed in the site basis @xmath30 has the following form , @xmath31 here @xmath29 is the hermitian hamiltonian of the internal system , while the second term in the right hand side corresponds to the coupling of the internal system to the leads . in the general case",
    "the coupling is characterized by two parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 denoting the left and right leads , respectively . in our study , for simplicity , we assume symmetric couplings , @xmath36 .",

    "below , we chose the coupling parameter @xmath60 in such a way that the transmission in each channel is maximal .",
    "this means that we consider the so - called _ perfect coupling _ for which the average scattering matrix is zero @xmath61 . in our case , both for the 1d model with @xmath62 and for the q1d model with @xmath63",

[ fig1 ] .",
    "therefore , all the sub - bands ( [ nm ] ) are overlapped . however , the expression ( [ final ] ) can be generalized even for the case when the transverse hopping amplitudes are not equal to the longitudinal ones , this could lead to the non - overlapping of some sub - bands . in this case one",
    "has also to take into account the influence of the evanescent modes as stated in ref .",
    ". another result can be found in ref .  [ ] where the localization - delocalization transition was studied when considering the strength of the transverse hopping as an independent parameter .",
    "now , since only one open mode contributes to transmission , one can suggest that the expression for the average total transmission ( in the energy region where only one mode is open ) can be obtained by inserting the localization length defined by eq .",

    "[ figu15 ] manifest that eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) gives very good description for the total transmission coefficient in the energy regions corresponding to only one open channel .",
    "one can also see that when more than one channel is open the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient acquires a quite complicated form , thus indicating the failure of the analytical approach in the general case .",
    "we have studied the transport properties of bulk - disordered q1d wires paying attention to the role of long - range correlations along disordered structures of finite size .",
    "first , we have manifested that in the case of stratified disorder all transport properties can be fully explained analytically . as predicted in ref .",
    "[ ] , in this case the expression for the total transmission coefficient @xmath113 can be presented as a sum of partial coefficients @xmath114 that correspond to independent 1d chains characterized by the index @xmath26 . since the theory of correlated disorder for 1d tight - binding models is fully developed ( see for example [ ] ) , this allows one to incorporate the obtained results into the problem of the correlated transport for q1d disordered systems .",
    "our numerical data demonstrate a perfect agreement with the analytical predictions . for the numerical study we have used the approach which is based on the non - hermitian hamiltonians from which one can construct the scattering matrix , therefore , all transport characteristics can be extracted .",
    "as the second step , we have analyzed the model in which the long - range correlations are taken in the same way as for the stratified disorder , however , the individual realizations of the disorder in the chains are independent from each other . since in this case the disorder potential depends on both coordinates , the longitudinal and transverse ones , there is mixing between different channels when the waves propagate through the q1d structure .",
    "since the general theory is absent , we have studied the situation when one channel is open only , while @xmath168 other channels are closed . for this case",
    "the rigorous theory is also absent , however , we suggest an approach which gives a phenomenological expression for the transmission coefficient , based on the results obtained earlier for white - noise disorder .",
    "the suggested expression turns out to be very good , as the comparison with the data shows .",
    "it should be noted that such a situation when the transport in q1d systems is practically defined by one open channel can be easily arranged experimentally .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that specific long - range correlations can result in a strong enhancement of the localization , even when the disorder is weak ( see results , discussion , and references in ref .",
    "this effect is clearly seen from our numerical data that is obtained for relatively short disordered samples .",
    "specifically , the emergence of the energy windows where the transmission coefficient vanishes or becomes very small , is a direct consequence of the enhancement of the localization .",
    "interestingly enough , such an enhancement of localization in the selected energy windows is accompanied by the suppression of localization in the complementary energy windows within the energy band@xcite .",
    "therefore , the long - range correlations can be considered as the mechanism for the redistribution of the degree of localization in the energy space .",
    "this effect can be used to manufacture devices with controlled transport properties in photonic heterostructures , semiconductor superlattices , and electron nanoconductors ; among others .",
