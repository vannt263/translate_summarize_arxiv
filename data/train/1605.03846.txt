    "it is by now well known that there exist non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath0 , the group of biholomorphisms of the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath1 .",
    "the first examples were due to mostow  @xcite , who gave explicit sets of matrices that generate non - arithmetic lattices ( the fact that these groups are indeed lattices was proved by constructing explicit fundamental domains for their action on the complex hyperbolic plane ) .    a similar approach ( using different kinds of fundamental domains ) was used by the author in joint work with parker and paupert  @xcite , and this allowed us to increase the number of known commensurability classes of non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath0 ( there are currently 22 known classes , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to give an alternate construction of the lattices @xmath2 of  @xcite , that avoids fundamental domains altogether . for a description of these groups ,",
    "see section  [ sec : s4c ] ( or  @xcite for much more detail ) .",
    "recall that , for @xmath3 , the groups @xmath2 give pairwise incommensurable non - arithmetic lattices , that are not commensurable to any deligne - mostow lattice .",
    "our results give a connection between these lattices and the automorphism group of the klein quartic , which is the closed riemann surface of genus 3 with largest possible automorphism group , i.e. such that equality holds in the hurwitz bound @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the corresponding automorphism group is the unique simple group of order 168 , and that it is also isomorphic to the general linear group @xmath5 in three variables over the finite field with two elements .",
    "this group also turns out to be the projectivization of a unitary group generated by complex reflections , which appears as the group @xmath6 in the shephard - todd list .",
    "the quotient @xmath7 is isomorphic as a normal complex space to the weighted projective plane @xmath8 ( this can be checked by deriving invariant polynomials from the equation of the klein quartic , see section  [ sec : weighted ] for details ) .",
    "the branch locus of the corresponding quotient map @xmath9 is an irreducible curve @xmath10 of degree 21 in @xmath11 , which we refer to as the klein discriminant .",
    "this can be rephrased to the statement that the pair @xmath12 is a complex projective orbifold , i.e. an orbifold uniformized by @xmath13 , which we refer to as the klein orbifold .",
    "we will see that the pair @xmath14 obtained from the klein orbifold by changing the multiplicity of @xmath10 from 2 to 3 is also an orbifold , but now uniformized by the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath1 .",
    "more generally , our main result will state that , for @xmath15 , the pair @xmath16 _ can be modified _ to a complex hyperbolic orbifold .",
    "indeed , for @xmath17 , changing the multiplicity of the ramification divisor is not enough , much more drastic modifications are needed .    in order to explain these modifications , we start by establishing notation .",
    "let us denote by @xmath18 the line arrangement in @xmath13 given by the mirrors of complex reflections in @xmath6 , which has 28 triple points and 21 quadruple points .",
    "the action of @xmath6 is transitive on the set of triple intersections , and also on the set of quadruple intersections .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) the image in @xmath11 of any triple ( resp . quadruple ) intersection .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the blow - up of @xmath13 at the 21 quadruple intersections of @xmath18 .",

    "we denote by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we denote by @xmath10 either the klein discriminant in @xmath26 or its strict transform in @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 denotes the exceptional locus above @xmath20 either in @xmath27 or in @xmath28 , and @xmath30 denotes the exceptional locus in @xmath28 above @xmath19 .",

    "in fact , the pair @xmath40 is log - terminal at every point apart from @xmath20 ( see proposition  [ prop : terminal_locus ] ) , so we consider @xmath41 .",

    ", we will use a description due to naruki of the fundamental group of the complement of the klein configuration of mirrors in @xmath13 , see  @xcite .",

    "the case @xmath54 turns out to be less interesting , since the corresponding lattice is arithmetic , see proposition  [ prop : infty ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : iso ] relies in part on previous joint work of the author with parker and paupert , namely some of the non - discreteness results in  @xcite ( which we review in section  [ sec : s4c ] ) .",
    "putting together theorems  [ thm : compact ] ,  [ thm : noncompact ] and  [ thm : iso ] , we get a new proof that the groups @xmath55 are discrete , a fact which was known so far only by using heavy computer work , see  @xcite ( and also  @xcite )",
    ".    the construction of ball quotients via uniformization ( exploiting the equality case in the bogomolov - miyaoka - yau inequality ) appears in several places in the literature , notably in work of barthel , hirzebruch and hfer  @xcite .",
    "in fact , after proving theorems  [ thm : compact ] and  [ thm : noncompact ] , we realized that the lattices @xmath56 with even values of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) appear explicitly on p.  215 of the book  @xcite .",
    "moreover , that table suggested to us to include the value @xmath54 .",
    "the barthel - hirzebruch - hfer construction was later reinterpreted and extended by couwenberg , heckman and looijenga , and it turns out that all lattices @xmath56 , @xmath59 appear in their paper ( see table  8.5 of  @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to these groups as chl lattices of shephard - todd type @xmath6 .",
    "the isomorphism of theorem  [ thm : iso ] also implies the following .",

    "the arithmetic structure of the chl ball quotients was never worked out in the literature , nor was their commensurability relations with other known ball quotients .",
    "it seems to have been known to deligne and mostow , at least conjecturally , see page  181 in  @xcite ( deligne and mostow also refer to the work of yoshida  @xcite ) .",
    "note that part of our proof ( the existence of a complex hyperbolic uniformization for the pairs in table  [ tab : pairs ] ) could in fact be avoided , if we were to simply quote the results of couwenberg , heckman , looijenga .",
    "however we believe our proof , which is fairly short and elementary , gives an interesting different perspective on this special case of the results in  @xcite .",
    "more of the lattices that appear in  @xcite can be treated with techniques similar to the ones in this paper , see for instance  @xcite .",

    "i also thank the referees for various suggestions that helped improve the manuscript .",
    "in order to describe the group @xmath56 , rather than using the original description , we use the characterization of this lattice given in proposition  [ prop : char_s4c ] .",
    "the characterization follows immediately from the results in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , we briefly review the argument .    in the next statement , we take @xmath60 to be elements of @xmath61 .",

    "clearly the eigenvalues of @xmath71 are roots of unity as well .",
    "it follows that the pair of matrices @xmath76 can be simultaneously conjugated to standard generators of a complex hyperbolic sporadic group , i.e. up to complex conjugation and multiplication by a cube root of unity , @xmath77 can be assumed to be one of the 10 values @xmath78 , @xmath79 listed in  @xcite .    inspection of the values of the order of @xmath71 and the braid length @xmath80 for these values of @xmath77 show that we may assume @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",

    "both non - discreteness statements just mentioned follow from theorem  9.1 of  @xcite .",

    "for @xmath249 , there is no such normal subgroup , as can be verified fairly easily using computational group theory software .",
    "here and in what follows , we write @xmath251 .",
    "consider the field @xmath252 and the ideal generated by @xmath253 .",
    "note that @xmath254 is a factor of 2 in @xmath255 , since @xmath256 , which gives @xmath257 an integral basis for @xmath258 is given by @xmath259 .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath260 is a field with two elements , which we simply denote by @xmath261 , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 reduce to 1 , while @xmath264 reduces to @xmath265 .",
    "in particular , the matrices @xmath62 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 from equation   reduce to @xmath268 it is well known that @xmath269 , and that it is the unique simple group of order 168 , see the atlas of finite groups  @xcite for instance . for an elementary proof , as well as an overview of other proofs in the literature , see also  @xcite .    using gaussian elimination , it is easy to see that @xmath5 is generated by the above three matrices together with two permutation matrices @xmath270 and @xmath271 corresponding to a transposition of two standard basis vectors .",
    "one checks that the residue field is @xmath280 , which we write as a vector space over @xmath281 generated by @xmath120 and @xmath282 . for a suitable choice of @xmath282 , the reduction of the matrices",
    "are given by @xmath283 the study of the group generated by these matrices is slighlty more subtle than for the case @xmath38 , since @xmath247 is quite large .",
    "we will use the group presentation for @xmath6 given by shephard and todd , see p.  299 of  @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 , and verify that @xmath287 .",
