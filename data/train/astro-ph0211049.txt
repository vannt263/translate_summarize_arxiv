    "the astrophysical origin of the surface magnetic activity of solar - type main sequence stars has been established with some confidence @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are generated by differential rotation at the interface ( tachocline ) between the radiative and convective zones and rise through the convection zone to the surface where they produce active regions , violent flares , coronal heating and other effects .",
    "oscillations in this dynamo account for the 22-year solar cycle . in other main sequence stars , the principal evidence for such a dynamo is the ubiquitous relationship between magnetic activity indicators and surface rotation : more rapidly rotating stars exhibit higher levels of activity until , for some indicators , a saturation of the process is reached .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether this model applies to late - type stars with substantially different internal structure from the sun s such as pms t tauri stars , post - main sequence giants , and low - mass m dwarfs .",
    "such stars may have tachoclines buried deep in the interior or may be fully convective without any tachocline . yet",
    "both t tauri stars and dm main sequence stars exhibit large active regions and strong flaring indicating that magnetic field generation is operative .",
    "various suggestions have been made to account for this , such as a turbulent dynamo process distributed throughout the convective zone , but with little empirical support .",
    "notably , an activity - rotation relationship is sometimes but not always evident in these stars .",
    "but the samples for study have generally been small and the empirical results often discrepant .",
    "it has proved difficult to study the origins of magnetic activity in pms stars using traditional optical and ultraviolet indicators due to obscuration and confusion arising from gas infall and ejecta .",
    "elevated levels of x - ray emisison , in contrast , are ubiquitous in pms stars and are relatively unaffected by such problems ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    ". however , despite considerable effort with the @xmath8 and @xmath9 missions , the observational basis for understanding the elevated levels of pms magnetic activity is still murky .",
    "some studies show an x - ray / rotation correlation while others do not , and other confounding correlations with bulk properties are present (  2.1.3 ) .",
    "the theoretical issues are also more complex than with main seqence stars (  2.2 ) .",

    ", a single image reveals @xmath10 x - ray emitting pms stars that span the entire initial mass function and a good portion of the pms evolutionary tracks .",
    "the onc has been the subject of intense optical and infrared study so that nearly a thousand of its members have been placed on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram and over four hundred have photometrically measured rotation periods .",
    "together , the @xmath0 and optical results give a great increase in sample size for study of the origins of pms magnetic activity compared to previous efforts .",
    "we find no evidence for the x - ray / rotation correlation strongly present in main sequence stars among onc stars .",
    "various other effects are found which may constrain alternative explanations for pms magnetic activity .",
    "the most promising interpretation , in our view , is that the magnetic fields are produced by a distributed dynamo within the deep convective zone .",

    "we review here past observational (  [ xray_rev.sec ] ) and theoretical studies (  [ theor_rev.sec ] ) studies which provide the foundation for the present study .",
    "we find that the situation for main sequence f - k stars is reasonably clear : rotation appears to be the principal observable correlate to x - ray luminosity and , through the rossby number , rotation can be linked to an @xmath7-type dynamo that successfully explains many features of solar and stellar activity . the rossby number @xmath11 , the ratio of the rotational period @xmath12 to the convective overturn time @xmath13 near the base of the stellar convection zone , is a measure of the growth rate of the field in many dynamo theories .",
    "rossby numbers account for mass - dependent structural differences in stellar interiors and are quite stable to reasonable variations in assumptions concerning the physics of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "the situation is more confused for giants and dm stars where only weak activity / rotation relationships are seen .",
    "it is not clear whether magnetic fields in the these stars with deep convective zones arise from a modified @xmath7 dynamo or a distributed turbulent dynamo .",
    "for pms stars , the interpretation is even more uncertain : several dynamo concepts compete with the possibility that the magnetic fields are inherited from the gravitational collapse or arise from star - disk interactions .",

    "2 .   below @xmath23 ,",
    "main sequence stars exhibit a ` saturated ' x - ray level of @xmath24 .",
    "saturation is well - established for several tracers of magnetic activity in several classes of magnetically active stars @xcite .",
    "considered together , all manifestations of surface magnetic fields should not exceed @xmath25% @xmath26 , a general limit on the mechanical power in convection @xcite .",
    "but other saturation processes may also be involved such as : a limit of field generation capacity of the underlying dynamo , complete coverage of the surface by strong fields ( unity filling factor of photometric starspots ) , or centrifugal forces on large magnetic loops in rapidly rotating coronae @xcite .",

    "cluster ` ultrafast rotators ' with @xmath28 km s@xmath16 , rotationally coupled w uma binary stars , and some dm stars exhibit supersaturation . again",
    "the cause of the diminution of activity is uncertain : perhaps magnetic flux is concentrated toward the poles , centrifugal forces limit the coronal extent , or coronal temperatures lie out of the narrow @xmath9 passband in these rapidly rotating stars @xcite .    despite these interpretational difficulties and some discrepancies between different samples , the overall agreement over 3.5 orders of magnitude of x - ray luminosity seen in figure [",
    "main_sequence.fig]b is probably the clearest empirical indicator of the underlying relationship between magnetic activity and stellar angular momentum @xcite . in particular",
    ", the dependence of @xmath29 on mass appears to be relatively weak in main sequence stars in contrast to the findings we report here for pms stars (  [ mass.sec ] ) .",
    "the @xmath7 dynamo model is less convincing for stars with very deep convective zones such as m - type dwarfs and post - main sequence giants ; for these stars , the activity - rotation relation is confusing and poorly understood .",
    "this departure from solar - type main sequence stars is particularly relevant to pms stars which are fully convective at the birthline and ( except for very low mass stars ) develop radiative cores as they descend the hayashi tracks .",
    "standard interiors models indicate that the convective zone thickens as mass decreases on the main sequence and the stars become fully convective below mass @xmath30 m@xmath5 ( m3@xmath31m4 ) . yet , no change either in the distribution of rotational velocities or the activity / rotation relation is seen around this spectral type @xcite .",
    "this may be explained by deficiencies in standard interiors models that neglect to consider how magnetic fields can suppress the onset of complete convection down to @xmath32 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there may be a subset of m dwarfs where the surface activity does not depend on rotation ; these may be cases where the fields are generated throughout the convection zone .",
    "the rotational evolution of dm stars may be simpler than for higher mass stars as there is less opportunity for internal redistribution of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "considerable study has been made of magnetic activity of giants with masses @xmath33 m@xmath5 and bolometric luminosities @xmath34 l@xmath5 lying at the base of the red giant branch after crossing the hertzsprung gap , occupying the same region of the hr diagram as @xmath35 myr t tauri stars .",
    "their interiors range from nearly fully radiative g giants to k giants with an outer convective zone occupying @xmath36% of the stellar radius .",
    "the strongest effect among these stars is the ` coronal dividing line ' : giants with spectral types hotter than about k1 typically exhibit @xmath37 to 30 erg s@xmath16 ( @xmath38 to -5 ) while cooler giants are usually x - ray inactive , sometimes with @xmath39 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    while a rough link between x - ray luminosity and rotation is present because both are low for the cooler giants , the x - ray / rotation diagram for the hotter giants shows mostly scatter , up to three orders of magnitude in @xmath40 for a given rotational velocity @xcite .",

    "these authors suggest that the strength of the dynamo in these more massive giants is regulated more by internal differential rotation than the rotation itself .",
    "computations indicate that turbulence - induced differential rotation arises as the convective envelope thickens @xcite . however , it is possible that the coronal dividing line arise from differences in magnetic field configurations at the stellar surface rather than differences in dynamo processes @xcite .",
    "a valuable but inconclusive discussion on issues concerning magnetic activity in red giants appears in @xcite .",
    "high levels of x - ray emission are ubiquitous among pms stars , with the x - ray luminosity function extending from @xmath46 to @xmath47 erg s@xmath16 ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "this is far above typical main sequence levels of @xmath48 erg s@xmath49 but , because their surface areas are greater , their surface fluxes are typically an order of magnitude below main sequence saturation levels",
    ". the emission is characterized by high temperatures ( @xmath50 kev is typical but 5 to @xmath51 kev values are not uncommon ; f02a ) , too hot to be produced by an accretion shock .",
    "the x - ray emission is usually strongly variable ; for example , the @xmath0 dataset studied here indicates that solar mass onc stars exhibit flares with @xmath52 erg s@xmath16 every few days ( f02b ) .",
    "the emission is thus dominated by flares rather than a soft - spectrum , quiescent corona .",
    "the geometry of the reconnecting fields responsible for the flares is quite uncertain .",
    "possibilities include field lines rooted in the stellar surface as in older stars , field lines extending from the star to the disk , and fields in a disk corona .",
    "the relationship between activity and rotation for pms stars is not well - established .",
    "although elevated x - ray emission is present during all pms phases , rotation is more easily measured during the later phases when the continuum and sometimes broad emission line excesses of the ` classical ' t tauri phase have subsided .",
    "most of the measured periods are obtained from photometric time series of rotationally modulated cool starspots on ` weak - lined ' t tauri stars which are no longer interacting with their circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "promising evidence for a solar - type dynamo emerged from the @xmath8 @xmath14 when @xcite reported an anti - correlation between @xmath54 and rotation period in a sample of 13 classical and 8 weak - lined t tauri stars .",
    "their x - ray activity is elevated several - fold above active main sequence stars with similar rotations . however , the correlation is weaker and the scatter greater when a larger @xmath8 sample of 50 taurus - auriga stars are considered @xcite .",
    "studies of the entire taurus - auriga region with the @xmath9 all - sky survey gave large samples showing apparent correlations between x - ray luminosities and rotational periods and surface velocities @xcite .",
    "these results will be discussed with respect to our findings in  [ x_period.sec ] .    the x - ray / rotation relation has also been sought in other nearby star forming regions .",
    "@xmath9 studies of the chamaeleon i cloud and the onc , for example , show most stars lying below the saturation level without an evident x - ray / rotation correlation @xcite .",
    "two @xmath9 samples selected for unusually strong x - ray emission similarly show no x - ray / rotation correlation , with several stars overluminous in x - rays compared to saturated main sequence stars @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "a broad correlation with rotational speed is present in some samples , but considerable scatter is present and the relationship may not be the same as seen in main sequence stars ( figure [ main_sequence.fig ] ) .",
    "note , however , that previous investigations generally had samples too small to permit study of the rotational effects on x - ray activity independent of other properties such as stellar mass .",
    "the standard dynamo theory developed for the solar interior and applied to main sequence and giant stars as outlined above can not be readily applied to fully convective stars , as it assumes the field is generated and amplified at the interface , or tachocline , between the convective and radiative zones .",
    "however , models have been developed where dynamos operate throughout a convection zone @xcite .",
    "if sufficiently efficient , such a distributed dynamo could not only explain surface magnetic activity , but could have a considerable effect on the bulk stellar properties .",
    "for example , a field with 3% of the energy density of the gas distributed throughout the interior of pms stars shifts the hayashi tracks several hundred degrees towards the red compared to standard tracks in the hr diagram @xcite .      in a modern dynamo theory for sun - like stars",

    "these fields are then twisted and transported through the rotating convective zone to the surface ( the @xmath56 effect ) . with an appropriate choice of @xmath56 ,",
    "such models explain many characteristics of solar activity including the 22-year cycle , the ` butterfly diagram ' of active region magnetic orientations , and differential rotation in the solar interior inferred from inversion of helioseismological data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for dynamo mechanisms that scale with the rossby number , the deep convective zones of pms stars lead to @xmath13 values an order of magnitude longer than in main sequence stars , giving smaller @xmath57 values and more magnetic field generation at a given rotational period compared to main sequence stars",
    "however , the relevance of @xmath57 for pms magnetic field generation is not clear .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that for a distributed dynamo , the efficiency scales with the depth of the convective region as well as the inverse of the rossby number .",
    "two detailed calculations of the convective turnover time @xmath13 , and hence rossby numbers , for pms stars have been reported .",
    "first , @xcite considered nonrotating pms interiord and finds @xmath13 is @xmath58 days for fully convective pms stars at the top of the hayashi track . in higher mass stars",

    "m@xmath5 stars , @xmath13 falls only gradually over @xmath62 yr .",
    "second , @xcite provide calculations of @xmath13 using updated opal opacities , realistic surface boundary conditions , improved models of diffusion and rotational mixing , and angular momentum loss by a magnetized stellar wind .",
    "they treat fully convective hayashi track stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.2 m@xmath5 undergoing solid body rotation with equatorial surface velocity of 30 km s@xmath16 ( corresponding to a period @xmath63 days if @xmath64 r@xmath5 ) .",
    "surface rotation is assumed to decay with age as @xmath65 ( which may often not be correct ) .",
    "they find that @xmath13 rises from around 600 to @xmath66 days over several million years in 0.5 - 1 m@xmath5 stars , whereafter it drops to shorter timescales .",
    "more massive @xmath67 m@xmath5 stars start at @xmath68 days and only show the decline .",
    "this implies that dynamo efficiency is constant ( for solar - mass ) or grows @xmath69 orders of magnitude ( for sub - solar mass ) stars during the first @xmath70 myr , whereafter it drops by several orders of magnitude over gigayear timescales .",
    "we use @xmath13 values from @xcite in deriving @xmath57 values for onc stars below .",
    "we caution that the calculations of @xmath13 by @xcite and @xcite differ both in qualitative behavior and quantitatively by factors of @xmath71 over the age range of interest , and even the relevance of the rossby number for magnetic field generation or surface magnetic activity in these stars is uncertain .",
    "a distributed dynamo due to turbulence in the convection zone was first discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "they emphasize that the turbulent velocity field in a convection zone will generate small - scale magnetic fields that can attain energy densities comparable to the kinetic energy density of convective motions .",
    "rotation may enhance the rate of field generation but is not essential to the process .",
    "the principal result of adding an @xmath55 effect from the boundary between a convection zone and a radiative core is to build significant energy densities in large - scale fields , such as those that dominate the solar cycle .",
    "they argue that small - scale turbulent fields may coexist with large - scale @xmath7 fields generated in the tachocline , and should dominate the large - scale fields in stars with deep convective zones .",
    "recent calculations have been made of fully convective t tauri stars rotating nearly as a solid body with differential rotation around 1% , both radially within the convection zone and latitudinally along the surface @xcite .",
    "field amplification occurs throughout the convection zone , and little dependence on bulk rotation is expected . in other models of pms interiors , magnetic activity is inferred to arise from @xmath72 processes , producing non - axisymmetric and steady fields , in contrast to @xmath7 fields which are typically axisymmetric and oscillatory @xcite .",
    "@xcite outline a related dynamo concept for stars with deep convective envelopes . at the base of the convective zones where the alfvn velocity is low , magnetic fields are subject to little buoyancy and",
    "reside in the same region for a long time .",
    "they are then wound up and greatly strengthened by differential rotation , giving a strong field layer analogous to the tachocline in solar - type stars from which an @xmath7 dynamo can be sustained .",
    "@xcite give a valuable discussion concerning whether a sharp change in x - ray emission is expected in a star ( or ensemble of stars ) that passes from a core - convection zone structure to a completely convective structure .",
    "no clear prediction can be made : turning off an efficient @xmath7 dynamo should reduce the x - ray emission , but the less efficient @xmath72 dynamo may compensate by operating over a larger volume .    finally , we note that distributed dynamo theories refer to field generation in the stellar interior and do not specify how these field emerge onto the surface to produce the extremely large starspots and violent x - ray flares observed in pms stars .",
    "a critical issue is whether the surface magnetic saturation level , as measured by @xmath73 , could be substantially lower for a distributed dynamo than a main sequence @xmath7 dynamo .",
    "it is possible that the dominant source of magnetic flux in t tauri stars are ` fossil fields ' inherited from the star formation process rather than generated by a dynamo @xcite .",
    "poloidal magnetic fields of order @xmath74 g are roughly expected from compression of interstellar cloud fields @xcite . in a fully convective pms star",
    ", this fossil interstellar field should quickly decay due to turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "however , it is possible that the field may collect into flux ropes which would resist turbulent diffusion until a radiative core develops @xcite .",
    "pms magnetic fields might also arise in the radiative core ( which forms at @xmath75 myr for a 1 m@xmath5 star ) by capturing flux from the convective zone .",
    "such core fields could persist unchanged for billions of years and could coexist with convective zone dynamo - generated fields @xcite .",
    "relic fields trapped in the larger radiative cores of intermediate mass stars may account for the high surface fields in am / ap stars @xcite .",
    "unlike dynamo generated fields , relic fields are likely to have a global dipole component and may be non - axisymmetric @xcite .",
    "a global dipole is needed to produce the large - scale field lines thought to link the t tauri star to the circumstellar disk at the corotation radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "t tauri stars differ from older late - type stars in that they often have a circumstellar disk . while the disk is thermodynamically cold and neutral , sufficient x - rays and cosmic rays likely penetrate and ionize the disk to freeze in magnetic fields and initiate mhd instabilities and dynamo processes @xcite .",
    "some forms of magnetic activity , such as the reconnection flares that dominate the x - ray emission , may thus arise in three locations : at the stellar surface as in other late - type stars ; at the corotation interface between large - scale dipolar stellar fields and the inner disk @xcite ; or above the disk in a magnetically active",

    "while most onc stars appear to have formed within the past 2 myr , a tail of stellar ages appears to extend beyond 10 myr , although it is not clear these ages are accurate .",

    "we caution that comparisons of mean x - ray luminosities of different clusters is subject to systematic error due to different x - ray sensitivities and different levels of prior knowledge of the cluster memberships .",
    "a rise in x - ray emissivity with pms age is consistent with a model of stellar angular momentum evolution where surface rotation ( and presumably the internal magnetic dynamo efficiency ) rises as star - disk rotational coupling ends and the star contracts @xcite .",

    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show that this fall in x - ray luminosity is roughly equal to the decrease in bolometric luminosity from 0.3 to 10 myr , so that the x - ray emissivity @xmath98 is roughly constant at -3.8 .",
    "but a distinctive change is seen among the oldest onc stars : with the exception of a single intermediate mass outlier ( see  [ mass.sec ] ) , all of the 13 onc stars with apparent ages between 10 and 30 myr have unusually high x - ray emissivities with @xmath164 at the main sequence saturation level , similar to the @xmath156 cha finding .",
    "there are several possible interpretations for these stars .",
    "if they are indeed cluster members and are correctly placed in the hr diagram , they suggest an increase of @xmath135 with age . however , if they have been erroneously placed on the diagram , due perhaps to underestimation of their extinction , then @xmath26 would be higher and the @xmath135 ratio consistent with the bulk of the onc pms stars .",

    "they should be compared to analogous graphs of main sequence stars shown in figure [ main_sequence.fig ] which are discussed in  [ main_seq.sec ] .",
    "figures [ lx_rot.fig ] and [ main_sequence.fig ] immediately show two differences between pms and main sequence magnetic activity : a large fraction of onc stars have considerably stronger x - ray emission than main sequence with similar rotation periods ; and the strong main sequence anticorrelation between x - rays and period is dramatically absent in the onc populationc also does not follow the roughly parabolic locus , peaking around 1 day , seen in dm stars @xcite . ] .",
    "instead , a _ correlation _ in average luminosities with period is marginally present ( compare the boxplot notches in figure [ lx_rot.fig]b ) such that stars with periods @xmath165 days are about 4 times more x - ray luminous on average than stars with @xmath166 days .",
    "this trend is in the opposite direction of the strong _ anticorrelation _ seen in main sequence stars , for stars with similar periods ; for example , for solar - mass stars shown in figure [ main_sequence.fig]a , the x - ray luminosity of stars with @xmath165 days is @xmath167 times smaller than those with @xmath168 days .",
    "the @xmath98 @xmath100  @xmath12 diagram similarly does not show any sign of the steep decline in x - ray luminosity with period seen in main sequence stars over a similar period range ( compare figure [ lx_rot.fig]c with figure [ main_sequence.fig]a ) .",
    "perhaps the most challenging characteristic of this finding to explain are the high x - ray luminosities of very slowly rotating pms stars .",
    "such stars had been occasionally found in the past ; for example , @xcite noted that the onc star jw 157 (= p 1659 ) has a surprisingly high x - ray emissivity @xmath169 erg s@xmath16 for its 17.4 day period , and @xcite find recx 10 in @xmath156 chamaeleon has @xmath170 erg s@xmath16 with @xmath171 days . both of these are slowly - rotating weak - lined t tauri stars , although jw 157 appears to be very young ( @xmath172 yr ) while recx 10 is old ( @xmath173 yr ) .",
    "the onc provides a sample of @xmath174 such stars with @xmath165 days and @xmath175 with a wide range of masses .",
    "we recall that some @xmath8 and @xmath9 studies report x - ray / rotation correlations while others do not (  [ pms.sec ] ) .",
    "perhaps the clearest case that is discrepant from our result is the @xmath9 study of taurus - auriga pms stars by @xcite .",
    "they find that , for 39 stars in the soft x - ray band , x - ray emission systematically decreases from @xmath176 to 29.1 erg s@xmath16 and @xmath177 to @xmath178 as rotational period increases from @xmath59 to 10 days .",
    "we suspect that this discrepancy arises from incompleteness in the taurus - auriga sample ; it is difficult to define and study the population of this large cloud complex where star formation has occurred in cores dispersed over 500 square degrees .",
    "first , arguments have been put forward that taurus - auriga pms stellar samples are deficient both in high mass stars @xcite and faint low mass weak - lined t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the effects of such missing stars on an x - ray / rotation diagram is unknown .",
    "second , rotational periods of taurus - auriga stars were typically obtained from photometric observations of specific pms stars with observing sessions spanning @xmath179 days ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and result in periods for only 39 of 168 stars detected in the study of @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most onc periods were obtained from observing runs spanning several months or years @xcite , and result in periods for 232 of 525 stars in the present onc study .",
    "it is thus possible that an improved study of taurus - auriga rotations would show a subpopulation of slow rotators with strong x - ray emission which would remove the x - ray / rotation correlation found by @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that combining stars of different masses can blur relations between magnetic activity indicators and rotational periods .",
    "we address this in two ways .",
    "first , examination of individual symbols in the scatter plots in figure [ lx_rot.fig ] , which represent different mass ranges , shows no evidence of the expected decrease in x - ray emission with increasing period within individual mass strata .",
    "second , we consider the x - ray relation to rossby number , which is very effective in removing mass - dependent effects in the context of @xmath7 dynamo models @xcite . as described in  [ sample.sec ]",
    ", we obtain rossby numbers from the convective turnover times for pms stars calculated by @xcite , recognizing that they assume a single rotation rate and are available only for @xmath87 m@xmath5 stars .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ lx_rossby.fig ] ; panel ( c ) is most valuable for its comparison with the main sequence x - ray / rossby number relation ( figure [ main_sequence.fig]c ) .",
    "the x - ray / rossby number plot ( figure [ lx_rossby.fig]b ) gives a possible explanation for the absence of the expected x - ray / rotation relation .",
    "due to the very short calculated convective turnover times at the base of the deep convection zones of pms stars , most onc pms stars around @xmath180 m@xmath5 lie in the supersaturated regime rather than the linear regime where x - ray emission inversely correlated with rossby number .",
    "extremely long rotation periods around 100 days would be needed to move the onc stars into the linear regime .",
    "it is valuable to first recognize why this study may achieve results not available to previous observations . for pms stars ,",
    "x - rays from reconnection flares are the most easily observed indicator of surface magnetic activity .",
    "optical emission line indicators useful in other types of stars are often confused by lines due to accreted or ejected matter , and the ultraviolet is ofen obscured by interstellar matter .",
    "doppler imaging and zeeman effect studies are very valuable for mapping surface fields , but have to date been obtained for only a handful of the brightest t tauri stars .",
    "x - ray emission , on the other hand , is typically elevated @xmath181 times above solar levels during all phases of pms evolution @xcite .",
    "pms spectra show typical plasma energies around @xmath182 kev and are sometimes dominated by plasmas as hot as @xmath70 kev ( f02a ) , and can therefore been studied even in the presence of considerable interstellar absorption .",
    "a 2 kev photon has the same penetrability as a 2 @xmath183 m near - infrared photon , and is comparable to mid - infrared emission above 5 kev @xcite . finally , the onc provides the largest and best defined pms sample in the nearby galaxy in the sense that virtually all members of the cluster appear in the optical / infrared sample with very few contaminants from unrelated objects .",
    "the onc has the largest sample of pms stars with detailed optical photometric , spectroscopic and rotation measurements . while nearly all earlier x - ray telescopes studied the onc , only _",

    "however , these dramatic differences do not necessarily exclude the application of a standard dynamo (  [ alpha_omega.sec ] ) because , based on the limited availability of rossby numbers for onc stars , it appears that onc stars lie in the ` supersaturated ' regime around @xmath193 (  [ main_seq.sec ] ) .",
    "the slight increase in @xmath194 with @xmath195 seen in the full sample ( figure [ lx_rot.fig]b ) might represent the rise in x - ray emissivity from the supersaturated to the saturated regime seen in the main sequence populations .",
    "one argument against an @xmath7 dynamo is the level of saturation : pms activity shows a log - mean level of @xmath196 which is @xmath70 times below the saturation level seen in main sequence stars in the @xmath2 kev band .",
    "if the same process of magnetic field generation and eruption is involved in both classes of stars , why should the surface activity differ by so much in a systematic fashion ?",
    "the finding that x - ray luminosities scale approximately with stellar area (  [ size.sec ] ) suggests saturation at the surface , but we can not eliminate the possibility that x - ray luminosity instead scales with stellar volume , representing a saturation of the internal dynamo .    we are thus led to consider dynamos where the fields are entirely generated and amplified in the turbulent convection zone that fills all or most of the stellar interior (  [ dist_dyn.sec ] ) .",
    "such fields may be generated both on small - scales due to turbulence in the convection zone @xcite , and on large scales driven by a small differential rotation within the interior ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . while a full suite of calculations is not yet available , the solutions appear to be largely independent of the global rotation rate , consistent with the absence of an @xmath197 relation in our findings .",
    "these analytical treatments are supported by recent three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical calculations : fields quickly form and amplify to energy densities @xmath51% of the turbulent kinetic energy density in both slab geometries @xcite and large - scale differentially rotating spherical geometries @xcite .",
    "the cause and level of saturation of these distributed dynamos are perhaps not yet clear .",
    "an important constraint on any explanation for pms x - rays is the change in behavior seen amoung the more massive @xmath150 m@xmath5 stars considered here (  4.3 ) .",
    "they exhibit an enormous dispersion in x - ray emissivity with some in the @xmath198 range similar to lower mass stars , both others show @xmath199 .",
    "this emissivity drops further to @xmath200 for b stars ( f02a ) .",
    "we consider two explanations for this effect , both of which may be operative :    1 .   following f02a ( their  5.2 ) , these very low x - ray emissivities may be misleading due to binarity , where a lower mass secondary produces the observed x - rays and the higher mass p[rimary ( which dominates @xmath26 ) is magnetically inactive .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these systems are somewhat higher than the average low - mass pms onc stars , implying that the companions have higher than average mass ( e.g. 1 m@xmath5 rather than 0.3 m@xmath5 ) . detailed optical study of the @xmath150 m@xmath5 population could test the binarity hypothesis .",
    "the drop in x - ray emissivity among intermediate mass pms stars by an order of magnitude ( or more if the binary hypothesis is correct ) may be linked to structural changes in the stellar interior and consequent changes in dynamo activity .",
    "@xcite show that pms stars with masses above @xmath201 m@xmath5 arrive at the stellar birthline with radiative interiors undergoing nonhomologous contraction , in contrast to pms stars below @xmath202 m@xmath5 with fully convective interiors undergoing homologous contraction .",
    "they predict a narrow range of pms masses , @xmath203 m@xmath5 in their canonical model , where a composite structure of radiative core and convective mantle heated by deuterium burning occurs .",
    "the precise boundaries of these structural changes are very sensitive to the initial conditions , so that intermediate - mass onc stars with somewhat different ages and accretion histories can have very different structures .",
    "these internal structure differences may be reflected in the efficiency of the magnetic dynamo , leading to the wide dispersion of @xmath98 ratios we see in the @xmath6 m@xmath5 mass range ( figure [ lx_m.fig]c ) .",
    "the exact nature of the magnetic fields in these stars is not clear : conceivably different combinations of a distributed dynamo , tachocline dynamo or fossil field could be present in different stars with similar masses .      while models of relic and core magnetic fields in pms stars are not fully developed (  [ relic.sec ] ) , our findings do not support these as the source of fields responsible for the observed x - ray emission .",
    "we find only a mild temporal dependence of x - ray luminosity on stellar age ranging from @xmath204 to @xmath205 yr (  [ age.sec ] ) , during which time the stellar interior undergoes the important transition to a radiative core .",
    "the only hint of a dependence on internal structure is the clear dependence of x - rays on stellar mass .",
    "however , we can not determine whether the @xmath143 relationship arises from an astrophysical mechanism or as a byproduct of more fundamental relationships like @xmath206 constant , @xmath207 , or @xmath208 .",
    "but if a causal link between magnetic activity and mass is present , it conceivably could arise from the increased trapping of relic fields during the gravitational collapse of more massive stars , or from the increased capture of flux in the radiative core of more massive stars .",
    "our results also lend little support for models where x - ray emission is associated with a circumstellar disk (  [ disk_fields.sec ] ) high resolution camera which , unlike acis , does not give spectral information on the sources .",
    "many of their findings are similar to ours : no correlation of @xmath209 with rotational period , strong correlation between @xmath210 and mass with low - luminosity outliers at intermediate masses ; and a decline of @xmath211 with stellar age .",
    "one difference concerns the x - ray relationship to circumstellar disks : using the strength of the ca ii triplet lines as an indicator of accretion ( in contrast to our photometric and imaging disk indicators ) , they find that low - accretion onc stars have an order of magnitude higher x - ray luminosity than high - accretion stars .",
    "this is further evidence that young stellar x - rays are not primarily produced in disk fields . ] .",
    "this result may have important implications for the physics of the circumstellar disk ; in particular , x - ray ionization of disk gas and energetic particle bombardment of disk solids should be lower if the x - rays arise from fields close to the stellar surface than if they arise from the immediate vicinity of the disk ( * ? ? ? * f02b ) .",
    "finally , we note that the activity - rotation diagram for pms stars bears some phenomenological similarity to that obtained for post - main sequence giants and main sequence dm stars (  [ dm_giant.sec ] ) .",
    "for example , intermediate - mass @xmath150 m@xmath5 giants and pms stars show the same wide range of x - ray luminosities , from @xmath212 erg s@xmath16 to 31 erg s@xmath16 , unaffected by a wide range of rotational velocities @xcite .",
    "dm stars show a strong link between @xmath210 and stellar size @xcite .",
    "however , as several different models still compete to explain activity in these stars , it is unclear whether phenemological similarities between the magnetic activity of pms , dm and giant stars are astrophysically meaningful .",
    "with the greatly enlarged sample provided by the onc , observational constraints on the origins of magnetic activity in low - mass pms stars are more quantitatively and securely established compared to previous results .",
    "but , at present , we can not establish a definitive link between our findings and a unique theory of magnetic field generation in pms stars .",
    "there are two sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , we encounter a degeneracy between the physical properties correlated with x - ray emission .",
    "examination of the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram immediately reveals that bolometric luminosity , radius , mass and age are mutually dependent in a non - trivial and systematic fashion .",
    "we thus can not confidently extract from observations alone which property is astrophysically responsible for the magnetic activity we detect .",
    "second , theoretical models have often not been sufficiently developed to compare with our empirical findings ; additional theoretical calculations are clearly necessary .",
    "for example , calculation of rossby numbers ( as in * ? ? ? * ) for each star in our sample using its specific mass , age and rotation , would populate the x - ray / rossby number diagram ( figure [ lx_rossby.fig ] ) and possibly reveal new constraints and trends .",
    "it would also be very useful if pms dynamo models involving @xmath7 , @xmath72 and other distributed field generation processes were produced for pms interiors with a wide range of masses and rotations for comparison with our findings .",
    "initial models of this type have been reported by @xcite and references therein .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "the results seem to favor certain interpretations .",
    "the absence of an activity - rotation relation is by itself a good argument for some form of distributed dynamo arising throughout the convective zone , rather than the standard @xmath7 dynamo involving a tachocline .",
    "the scaling between x - ray emission and the volume of the convective region at lower masses , and the change of x - ray properties in some stars at intermediate masses when a radiative core appears , together support a distributed dynamo for most t tauri stars .",
    "but we can not yet exclude alternatives such as a standard dynamo in a ` saturated ' or ` supersaturated ' regime , where the saturation level occurs at a substantially lower value of @xmath73 than in main sequence stars .",
    "if pms stars indeed all have ` saturated ' dynamos , it is possible that little will be learned of their magnetic processes , expecially as we do not understand the causes of saturation even in main sequence stars .",
    "similarly , magnetic reconnection of a mass - dependent fossil field may still be a viable model .",
    "however , the findings to not support models where the x - rays are associated with a circumstellar disk , either reconnection of star - disk fields at the corotation radius or reconnection of sheared disk - disk fields .    additional forthcoming x - ray observations of the onc should provide critical new insights .",
    "a contiguous @xmath0 acis observation spanning @xmath213 days is planned which will give an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity essential for tracing magnetic activity in @xmath214 m@xmath5 pms stars , and a sufficiently long time series of all stars to obtain detailed characteristics of pms x - ray emission .",
    "several relevant studies are planned .",
    "the statistical properties of x - ray flares ( e.g. , the distribution of energies , durations and recurrence rates ) may reveal similarities or differences when compared to flares in the sun and older active stars .",
    "quiescent x - ray levels between flares will be sought , and may show less scatter in correlations with other stellar properties than we find here .",
    "we will search for rotationally modulated x - ray emitting structures which might reveal large - scale asymmetries in the magnetic field geometry predicted by @xmath72 dynamos and relic core fields .",
    "conceivably , transitions in the levels and structure of surface magnetic fields reflecting the emergence of a core radiative zone will be seen in comparisons of younger @xmath100 older and less @xmath100 more massive pms stars .",
