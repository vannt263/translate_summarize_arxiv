    "gas in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) , including the galactic halo , is heated by energy input from stellar winds and supernova events .",
    "these processes are responsible for redistributing energy and material throughout our galaxy , resulting in the formation of new generations of stars .",
    "the non - uniform interstellar gas exhibits a complex set of interacting shells , bubble - like structures ,  chimneys \" , and worms that are seen as evidence of stellar energy input .",
    "although the physical state and evolution of these gas phases have been broadly explained , it has not yet been determined whether the ism is best described by a three - phase model @xcite , a galactic fountain model @xcite , or a model with more isolated supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "there are still many outstanding problems with these ( and all other current ) models of the ism .",
    "the far - uv ( 900 - 1200 ) spectrum of diffuse interstellar emission contains astrophysically important cooling lines : the  doublet ( @xmath11 ) represents the dominant radiative cooling mechanism for gas with temperatures between 10@xmath12 and 10@xmath13 k. the  line ( @xmath14 ) is an important cooling mechanism in gas with temperatures between 10@xmath15 and 10@xmath16 k @xcite . because of the high cooling rates due to these and other lines , gas in this temperature range cools rapidly to lower temperatures , and therefore we refer to gas in this temperature range as `` transition temperature gas '' . due to the rapid cooling , in order to be observed this gas must be replenished , either from a source of higher temperature gas cooling through this temperature range , shock heating of cooler gas , conductive heating in a boundary between hot and cold gas , or turbulent mixing of hot and cold gas @xcite .",
    "the  ion , characteristic of gas with a temperature of @xmath7300,000  k , is a sensitive probe of transition temperature gas in our galaxy . in recent years",
    ", several detections of galactic  emission have been made with the _ fuse _  ( _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ) satellite .",
    "typical values at 1032   in directions with low @xmath17 ( )  are 2000 - 3300 photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  ( lu ) @xcite , although a recent measurement of halo gas was somewhat higher @xcite .",
    "the  survey of @xcite sampled 183 sightlines , 29 at 3-@xmath18 significance , with a median of 3300 lu .",
    "the median value of all 3-@xmath18 upper limits is 2600 lu .",
    "until recently , the galactic location of this hot - gas emission was unknown .",
    "@xcite concludes that the local ( @xmath19 pc ) contribution to this emission is negligible , with a 2-@xmath18 upper limit of 500 lu in the direction ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) = ( 278.6 , -45.3 ) ( later revised to 600 lu by @xcite ) .",
    "it therefore appears likely that most emission at high galactic latitudes arises from hot gas in the galactic halo .",
    "superbubbles are extremely large structures in the ism , believed to be blown by the combined energy output of a cluster of stars .",
    "such regions provide an important diagnostic of the processes by which supernovae and stellar winds control the overall evolution of our galaxy .",
    "superbubbles are expected to be filled with hot emitting gas .",

    "a shadowing strategy is used to determine the location of hot emitting gas towards the loop i superbubble .",
    "observations for the adjacent directions were made to compare the intensity of emission from each sightline .",

    "note , however , that @xcite used _ hst - stis _ uv absorption spectra towards the approximate center of loop i , ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) = ( 330 , 18 ) , and estimated that the approaching and receding walls of loop i are about 90 pc and 150 - 180 pc , respectively .",

    ", we determined the zero point of the wavelength scale by measuring the observed heliocentric wavelengths of airglow lines for each observation , and applying the measured offset ( no other term was deemed necessary ) to the spectrum .",
    "after this , multiple observations were combined on this corrected heliocentric scale , if necessary .",
    "this should correct for possible velocity shifts between the various segments .",

    "each emission line was assumed to be described by a 106 km s@xmath3  tophat ( image of lwrs aperture ) convolved with a gaussian characterized by @xmath28 , which includes both intrinsic and instrumental contributions @xcite .",
    "the 106 km / s appears to be nearly correct for lif1a , but the airglow lines appear somewhat narrower for other detector segments .",
    "the data were binned by 4 pixels prior to fitting , resulting in a pixel scale corresponding to 15 km / s .",
    "the errors were also smoothed so as to avoid 0 values , without removing significant structure .",
    "the lines were fit using the idl - based mpfit routines developed by craig markwardtcraigm / idl / idl.html ] .",
    "initially , only the 1032   line was included in the fit . since the @xmath27  emission line at 1037",
    "  is mixed with  emission at 1038  , we assume that the 1038   emission line is half the intensity of the  emission line at 1032  .",
    "this assumption is true for optically thin gas , and yields reasonable results in this case .",
    "this  fitted model was removed from the entire spectrum , leaving the @xmath27  emission line .",
    "the @xmath27  emission line was then fitted in the same way as the  emission line .",
    "the reasonableness of the @xmath27fits validates this procedure . the complete model is shown over the original spectrum in the figure .",
    "the results of the  fits are reported in table [ table : ovi ] .",
    "the results of the @xmath27  fits are included in table [ table : otherlines ] .",
    "the heliocentric wavelengths yield a heliocentric radial velocity , and have been converted to the standard local standard of rest ( lsr ) in table [ table : ovi ] .",
    "the 1-@xmath18 random error bars for each model parameter have been determined using the error estimation prescription of @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "note that the flux calibration uncertainty of @xmath7 10% @xcite , when combined with uncertainty in the solid angle of the lwrs aperture , results in a systematic uncertainty of @xmath29% @xcite .",
    "the width of the convolving gaussian ( reported as @xmath28 in table [ table : ovi ] ) includes both the intrinsic width of the emission line , and an instrumental contribution of 25 km / s @xcite .",

    "as noted earlier , we see no sign of contamination by airglow in the full dataset .",
    "however , in what follows we restrict ourselves to the results from the night - only spectra .",
    "in general , measurements from the full dataset are similar to those from the night - only spectra .",
    "we also searched all the night - only spectra for any other detections at the @xmath30 level . for every wavelength region , we considered the detector segment with the highest effective area .",
    "we assumed that the instrumental response was a tophat with width 0.365  ( corresponding to 106 km s@xmath3  at 1032  ) .",
    "we took a running average of each spectrum using this width , adjusting the errors appropriately . after removing a local median estimate of the continuum / background for each point",
    ", we statistically determined the 99.7% confidence limit of the data .",
    "since the errors are likely underestimated due to the low number of counts , this does not correspond precisely to a 3@xmath18 level .",
    "any spectral data points exceeding this level ( often airglow ) were investigated , and the results for all spectra / detectors at that wavelength were compared . line - fitting and error determination was done ( as described earlier ) for both sightlines if warranted for either . in some cases we excluded lines which appeared to be marginal detections in low sensitivity spectra , but did not appear in higher sensitivity spectra taken with other detector segments .",
    "the results of the fits are reported in table [ table : otherlines ] , including the lsr radial velocity for features detected on both sightlines .",
    "note that we have searched for features that result from a filled ( or nearly filled ) aperture , but minimal intrinsic width .",
    "we might therefore have missed significant broad features in the spectra . as an example , consider the  line , which met our criteria in the ` shadowed ' sightline but not the ` unshadowed ' one , where it is broader ( see table [ table : otherlines ] ) .    to determine upper limits on",
    "astrophysically interesting emission lines , we first estimated the 95% confidence limit for each point , evaluated in the same fashion as discussed above .",

    "these values are quoted in table [ table : otherlines ] .",
    "any feature for which some points lay above the 95% confidence level in this region were fit .",
    "the results of the fits are included in the table , however the widths were poorly determined and are not tabulated . from these measurements , we tabulate the radial lsr velocity only for intensity measurements that are unlikely to be contaminated with airglow .",
    "the observed intensities for the ` shadowed ' and ` unshadowed ' sightlines are @xmath0 = 2750 @xmath1 550 photons",
    "@xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  and @xmath4 = 10800 @xmath1 1200 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  ( lu ) . to interpret our data",
    ", we made several assumptions and used the following two equations for the intensity of emission from each sightline :    @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates the intensity of emission from the local bubble ( more specifically , from the near side of the iz ) and @xmath34 indicates the intensity of emission from beyond any intervening material along the ` unshadowed ' sightline .",
    "this material has optical depth @xmath35 along the ` shadowed ' sightline and @xmath36 along the ` unshadowed ' sightline .",
    "note that @xmath36 may be non - zero , because that sightline passes through the boundaries of both the local bubble and loop i ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "most significantly , we are assuming that @xmath33 and @xmath37 are the same along both the ` shadowed ' and ` unshadowed ' sightlines , and that the difference between the optical depths along the two sightlines ( @xmath38 ) is due entirely to material in the iz .",
    "it is unclear how patchy the  emission or absorbing material might be",
    ". the possible limitations of these simplifying assumptions must be kept in mind throughout the discussion below .    because we expect the iz to contain most of the absorbing material , for simplicity in this section we assume that @xmath36 = 0 and @xmath39 .",
    "we will relax this assumption in section [ subsect : physical ] . to get a lower limit on the  emission interior to loop i , we assumed ( case 1 ) that the interaction zone ( iz ) was completely opaque ( @xmath40 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath33 = 2750 @xmath1 550 lu and @xmath37 = 8050 @xmath1 1320 lu . in case 2",
    ", we assumed that no emission arose within the local bubble ( @xmath41 lu ) , reflecting the results of @xcite . this yields @xmath34 = 10800 @xmath1 1200",
    "lu , optical depth @xmath42 = 1.4 @xmath43 and @xmath17()@xmath44 ( assuming @xmath17 ( )  = 3 @xmath45 10@xmath46 for @xmath42 = 1 ; @xcite ) . finally , for case 3 we assumed that the shadowing material in this region had the average properties of the interaction zone as determined by @xcite . under these assumptions @xmath17()@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath33 = 1890 @xmath1 620 lu and @xmath37 = 8910 @xmath1 1460 lu .",
    "the extreme case 1 is unlikely to be correct , especially in light of the @xcite upper limit to local bubble emission of 600 lu ( revised by @xcite ) , but the derived lower limit does indicate that substantial emission must be arising from beyond the iz .",
    "case 2 provides a lower limit on the iz  column density that is consistent with our results and assumptions , since a smaller value for @xmath17 ( )  yields negative emission within the local bubble .",
    "note that assuming the local bubble contribution is @xmath49 lu does not significantly change the calculated value of @xmath42 or @xmath17()@xmath50 for this case .",
    "the local bubble contribution resulting from case 3 is significantly larger than the @xcite upper limit . either the actual  column density of the iz along our sightline is less than the value reported by @xcite , the local bubble  emission is substantially non - uniform , or there is more  emission arising in interfaces on the near side of the iz than elsewhere in the local bubble . in the latter case ,",
    "the interaction between loop i and the local bubble may have compressed or otherwise altered local bubble material in this region . as we will discuss below and in section [ subsect : physical ] , the case 3  column density is also inconsistent with other estimates of @xmath17()@xmath50 .",
    "recent data from reis & corradi ( 2007 , personal communication ) suggest that the interaction zone along this line of sight has an e(@xmath51 ) extinction of 0.03 , which would be equivalent to a hydrogen column of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this is a factor of two below the lower limit to  column density consistent with our simple model ( see case 2 above ) , and appears inconsistent with our results and assumptions .",
    "however , since our particular line of sight was chosen because of a notable x - ray shadow , it is likely that it represents a more dense portion of the interaction zone than is typical , and so has a higher column density than is typical .",
    "we also considered the @xcite measurements of total ( to infinite distance )  column density along the line of sight for both sightlines .",
    "the nearest dickey & lockman ( hereafter dl ) measurements give @xmath17()@xmath53 = @xmath54 and @xmath17()@xmath55 = @xmath56 .",
    "the difference between them is @xmath57 , which we use to estimate @xmath42 , assuming that this difference arises solely within the iz .",
    "then our simple model yields an unphysical negative value for the local bubble intensity , suggesting that the total neutral hydrogen differences in the two directions are not due only to the interaction zone , but also include differences in material beyond the iz ; we can not necessarily use these measurements to estimate @xmath38 .",
    "interpolating over the four nearest dl measurements gives @xmath17()@xmath53 = @xmath58 and @xmath17()@xmath55 = @xmath59 .",
    "the difference between these is @xmath60 , consistent with case 2 above .",
    "however , because dl is a composite of multiple surveys averaged over 1 degree bins and because galactic column densities can vary significantly over arcminute scales , there are potentially large errors when comparing to emission in two 30  fields .",
    "@xcite detected  emission with an intensity of 4000 @xmath1 1300 lu along a nearby sightline at ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) = ( 282.1 , + 11.1 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : rosat_small ] , this sightline also lies near the edge of the iz , and has less extinction at @xmath26 kev than our ` shadowed ' sightline , but more than our ` unshadowed ' sightline . not surprisingly , the observed  emission lies between our two measurements .",
    "however , the 1-@xmath18 errors are such that this sightline could , in principle , have  emission less than that along our ` shadowed ' sightline .",
    "as a result , this sightline is of limited use in further constraining our results .    in all cases considered ,",
    "the local contribution to the emission is small , indicating that most of the emission lies beyond our local bubble . in case 2 ( which we prefer )",
    ", the measured  emission along the ` shadowed ' sightline largely originates beyond the iz .",
    "the estimated intensity of emission from beyond the iz is significantly larger than the typical measurement ( @xmath7 2500 lu ) for directions of low hydrogen column density .",
    "given the total @xmath17 ( )  @xmath7 10@xmath61 along our sightlines ,  emission from the thick - disk or galactic halo would be attenuated by a factor of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . to provide a significant portion of the observed emission ,",
    "such a component would require intrinsic intensities of 10@xmath64 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , which could only arise from highly over - pressure regions such as young snr , as seen in  maps generated by _ spear _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since no known young snr exist on this line of sight , we conclude a significant portion of our detected emission must be associated with the loop i superbubble itself . for the remainder of the paper , we assume that all detected  emission arising beyond the iz originates within loop i.      [ subsect : physical ]    it is possible to use the _ rosat _  @xmath26 kev ( r12 ) and @xmath65 kev ( r34 ) background measurements to estimate the difference in hydrogen column due to the iz along each line of sight .",
    "using a 0.1  radius circle centered on our sightlines , the _ rosat _  count rates ( 10@xmath66 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath67 ) along the ` shadowed ' sightline are r12 = 749 @xmath1 175 and r34 = 227 @xmath1 86 while those for the ` unshadowed ' sightline are r12 = 1423 @xmath1 165 and r34 = 180 @xmath1 61 @xcite .",
    "we modeled the region as a _",
    "chianti _ equilibrium plasma model @xcite .",
    "the output spectrum of this model is absorbed along the ` unshadowed ' line of sight by a non - iz  column , and on the other by a combination of the non - iz  column and an additional column density due to the iz .",
    "as noted earlier , the boundaries of the local bubble and loop i may well provide material that attenuates emission arising from within loop i , even along the ` unshadowed ' sightline . by assuming that both the x - ray plasma temperature and emission measure are the same on both lines of sight , we use the x - ray band intensities to derive a plasma temperature of @xmath68 k , a non - iz column density of @xmath69 , and an iz column density of @xmath70 .",
    "( in this circumstance the errors represent the @xmath71 limits of the absorbed plasma models , which includes the statistical errors of the x - ray count rates . )",
    "the estimated iz column density is consistent with the value we obtained for case 2 by assuming none of our observed  emission arises within the local bubble , although that result assumed there was no extinction along the ` unshadowed ' sightline .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting plasma in this model does not produce significant ovi emission ( @xmath72 10 lu ) and is , therefore , not sufficient to explain the observed emission without significant additional plasma at lower temperature .",
    "we now relax our earlier assumption that @xmath73 , and instead use the values corresponding to the output of the chianti models : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "this results in @xmath77 lu , and @xmath78 lu . the negative local bubble emission is unphysical , but the result is entirely consistent with no emission from this side of the iz . based on this model , @xmath5 800 lu ( 1-@xmath18 upper limit ) of  emission arises on the near side of the iz . compared with the earlier estimate from case 2 , allowing for extinction by intervening material increases the amount of  emission arising within loop i by @xmath760% .    in order to determine how much of the  emission arises from hot gas filling the loop",
    "i superbubble , and how much from hot gas mixing with cooler gas at the interfaces within the interaction zone , we estimate the pathlength of the -emitting gas as follows .",
    "we first assume that the -emitting plasma is near the temperature of peak  emission ( @xmath79 k ) and convert the loop i  emission to an emission measure . using 18000@xmath13400 lu for the extinction corrected loop i  intensity results in an emission measure of @xmath80 cm@xmath66 pc .",
    "temperatures away from the  peak require higher emission measure , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 representing the points at which the required emission measure would double .",
    "@xcite found two types of -emitting gas within the galaxy : gas with densities of @xmath9 0.01 @xmath10 and gas with @xmath9 0.1 @xmath10 .",
    "these two densities result in -emitting pathlengths of @xmath7120 pc and @xmath71.2 pc , respectively . if we further assume pressure equilibrium between the x - ray emitting plasma and the lower temperature -emitting plasma , as would be expected",
    "if the originates in interfaces between hot and cool gas , we can derive the relative filling factors of the x - ray and  plasmas within loop i. we performed this calculation using the appropriate x - ray temperature , x - ray and  emission measures as found above .",
    "we find that given the above values and their error , the loop i -emitting path is between @xmath84 and @xmath85 times the x - ray emitting path if the -emitting plasma is near the  peak .",
    "if the -emitting plasma is not at the  peak , the required path length could be substantially larger .",
    "similarly , if the pressure in the x - ray emitting gas is higher than that of the -emitting gas , the relative -emitting path is correspondingly larger by a factor of @xmath86 . the maximum total x - ray and  emitting pathlength through loop",
    "i under the two density assumptions would be either @xmath7 2.5 pc or @xmath7 250 pc .",
    "assuming the distance to the iz is @xmath7 70 pc @xcite , and the radius of the loop i superbubble is @xmath7 100 pc @xcite , we can use the angular distance between the ` unshadowed ' sightline and the center of loop i @xcite to geometrically determine the distance to the center of loop i and the pathlength of the ` unshadowed ' sightline through loop i ( under the poor assumption of spherical symmetry ; see figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "we find that the pathlength along the ` unshadowed ' sightline is @xmath715 pc , and the pathlength along the ` shadowed ' sightline is @xmath7 20 pc .",
    "although the exact numbers are sensitive to the choice of input values and geometrical assumptions , the main conclusion is not : since our sightlines do not lie near the center of loop i , our pathlength through loop i must be substantially less than its total diameter of @xmath7 200 pc . as a specific example , if the distance to the iz is larger than 70 parsecs , then the radius of the ( assumed ) spherical loop i must be larger ; otherwise our ` unshadowed ' sightline lies outside of loop i ( unlikely given the measured intensity in this direction ) .",
    "the resulting inferred pathlength through loop i would then still be substantially less than the diameter of loop i. as a result , the density of the -emitting gas is more likely to be @xmath7 0.1 @xmath10 ( pathlength @xmath7 2.5 pc ) than @xmath7 0.01 @xmath10 ( pathlength @xmath7 250 pc ) .",
    "we note that the thermal pressure of 30,000 @xmath10  k calculated under the assumption of @xmath87 @xmath10 and @xmath88  k compares well with the loop i x - ray emitting gas pressure of 46,000 @xmath10 k estimated by @xcite and the midplane x - ray emitting gas pressure of 28,000 @xmath10  k determined by @xcite .",
    "in addition , figure 2 of @xcite , who modelled the history and future of the local and loop i bubbles , also suggests that the -emitting gas should be confined to the interior interfaces of loop i.    the intrinsic fwhm of the  1032   emission line are reported in table [ table : ovi ] .",
    "since an instrumental contribution of 25 km / s corresponds to a convolving gaussian with @xmath28 = 0.037  any best - fit gaussian narrower than this indicates that the lwrs aperture is not filled : i.e. that the emitting region is non - uniform .",
    "this is technically the case for our fit to the night - only spectrum along the ` shadowed ' sightline , but a filled aperture is within the 1-@xmath18 error bars . under the assumption that the entire intrinsic width is due to thermal broadening , we calculated the temperature of the emitting gas for each of our estimates of  intensity . for the night - only ` shadowed ' measurement",
    ", we assumed a width corresponding to the upper end of the 1-@xmath18 error range .",
    "this yields a temperature of @xmath89 k. the day + night ` shadowed ' measurement corresponds to a temperature of @xmath90 k. the night - only and full - data ` unshadowed ' measurements yielded temperatures of 3.9 @xmath1 0.15 million k and 2.5 @xmath1 0.15 million k , respectively .",
    "the ` shadowed ' measurements are roughly consistent with thermal broadening , while the widths for the ` unshadowed ' sightline are larger .",
    "this weakly suggests that gas motions , possibly turbulent , are contributing to the width of the  emission in loop i , or that the emission we see comes from more than one distinct emitting region with different radial velocities . as noted earlier , it is likely that the majority of the emission for even the ` shadowed ' sightline originates from beyond the iz .",
    "the difference in widths may indicate that the loop i gas properties differ somewhat between the sightlines .",
    "differences in best - fit radial velocities of the ` shadowed ' and ` unshadowed ' emission also suggest inhomogeneous properties for the emitting gas within loop i. it is important to note , however , that non - uniform surface brightness within the 106 km / s wide aperture profile can mimic a velocity shift , and the ` shadowed ' sightline width suggests this scenario .",
    "this could be due to either inhomogeneous emission or patchy absorption by the iz .",
    "we note that our derived loop i  emission intensity is much less than that measured by _",
    "spear _ towards the vela supernova remnant @xcite , as is expected since vela is a much younger structure , containing strong radiative shocks and filled with a large amount of gas cooling through @xmath7 3 @xmath91 k. _ spear _ s measurement of  towards the orion - eridanus superbubble is much more similar , peaking at @xmath7 7000 lu along the edge of the structure , and confined to a region @xmath92 pc across @xcite . thus the  in both loop i and orion - eridanus appears to arise in interfaces at the edge of the bubble , rather than from gas filling the interior .",
    "the observed  intensities for the ` shadowed ' and ` unshadowed ' sightlines are @xmath0 = 13300 @xmath1 2200 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  and @xmath93 = 15000 @xmath1 5000 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "these measurements are consistent with the @xmath94 lu seen by _ spear _ in this part of the sky @xcite , although the _ spear _ measurement is an average over 64 square degrees .",
    "we assume that dust opacity at 977  is 13% higher than at 1032  @xcite , and use the same optical depth analysis as for the .",
    "for the  column densities from the chianti model of the previous section , we obtain  intensities of @xmath95 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  and @xmath96 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  for emission originating on the near and far sides of the iz , respectively .",
    "the large error bars on the distant emission are primarily due to the opacity of the intervening material .",
    "the inferred nearby emission is substantially more than the  observed within the local bubble by @xcite , suggesting non - uniform emission , possibly as a result of  production at inhomogeneous interfaces .    unlike",
    ", a significant proportion of the observed  emission arises on the near side of the iz . of the 15000 @xmath1 5000 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3",
    "sr@xmath3  observed along the ` unshadowed ' sightline , at least 9600 photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 sr@xmath3  ( 1-@xmath18 lower limit ) arises within the local bubble .",
    "such a situation could arise if the interface between the local bubble and the interaction zone were significantly cooler ( @xmath97 ) than the loop i / interaction zone interface , because hot gas within loop i would further ionize carbon , reducing the amount of  emission originating beyond the iz .",
    "this lends support to the idea that the local bubble is not filled with overpressured hot ( @xmath98 k ) gas @xcite .",
    "however , the large error bars on @xmath99 prevent us from concluding that there is no significant  emission within loop i.    three other species , all present in the neutral ism , have significant measurements along both sightlines : @xmath27 , , and .",
    "as may be seen in table [ table : otherlines ] , in all cases the measurements for the two sightlines are quite similar , agreeing within the errors .",
    "this suggests that most of the emission arises in the near side of the iz , as for .",
    "note that the measurements may be contaminated by nighttime airglow .",
    "the radial velocity for along the ` unshadowed ' sightline is consistent with geocoronal emission at the 1-@xmath18 level . along",
    "the ` shadowed ' sightline , the radial velocity is inconsistent with geocoronal emission at the 1-@xmath18 ( and possibly 2-@xmath18 ) level , although it is difficult to be specific since that measurement combines two observations with disparate geocentric to heliocentric corrections .",
    "apart from , which may also be contaminated by nighttime airglow , measurements and upper limits for all remaining species in table [ table : otherlines ] are consistent between the two sightlines , again suggesting that emission for these low - ionization species arises largely in the near side of the iz .",
    "the radial velocities for these species are shown in table [ table : otherlines ] . in general , the radial velocities along",
    "the ` shadowed ' sightline tend to be lower than along the ` unshadowed ' sightline , although the relatively large error bars make it difficult to be specific .",
    "this could indicate that the emission along the ` unshadowed ' sightline arises at the boundary between the local bubble and the surrounding neutral ism , while the emission along the ` shadowed ' sightline arises at the interface between the local bubble and the interaction zone . in this case",
    ", we would expect lower radial velocities along the ` shadowed ' sightline , because the expansion of loop i could push the iz towards us .",
    "we have performed a shadowing measurement using absorption of emission along a line of sight that intersects the purported interaction zone between the loop i superbubble and the local bubble .",
    "the results are consistent with moderately bright  emission ( @xmath94 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 ) interior to loop i , likely arising near the walls of the bubble , with absorbing dust in the interaction region equivalent to an  column density of @xmath100",

    "s@xmath3 sr@xmath3of the observed emission arises from the interface between the local bubble and the interaction zone .    unlike , emission from  and other low - ionization species along the same sightlines shows a very significant local component .",
    "the disparity in the origin of  and  on these sightlines indicates that the conditions in the interface between the interaction region and the local bubble are significantly different than in the hot / cold interfaces within loop i. these differences are likely due to differences in the temperature and pressure of local bubble gas relative to conditions within loop i.    we are grateful to w. corradi & w. reis for providing a detailed reddening map of the region near our observations , and k. nishikida for discussions about loop i. this paper used observations obtained by the nasa - cnes - csa _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
