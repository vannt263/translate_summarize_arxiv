    "we also found that cumulative probability @xmath319 is non - monotonic with system size @xmath0 for any fixed @xmath1 for some of the ricepile models .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the cumulative probability distribution @xmath76 of residence times at site @xmath9 with system size @xmath0 is possible when the probability distribution function @xmath320 , where @xmath32 is the height at site @xmath9 , sharply decays for @xmath321 .",
