    "the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) has become more prominent with the discovery of a light higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . on the other hand , no new physics which could address the hierarchy problem",
    "has shown up in the searches at the lhc so far .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , the canonical susy scenarios are already highly constrained by the null results of many susy searches at the lhc .",
    "in particular , the gluino and the first two generation squarks are constrained to be heavier than @xmath1  tev if they have the standard @xmath2-parity conserving decays  @xcite .",
    "the third generation squarks , on the other hand , have weaker bounds .",
    "not only the mass reaches are lower than those of the first two generation squarks , but also in the low mass region there is still plenty of parameter space not being experimentally excluded , due to the more complicated decay patterns and sm backgrounds . since they have the largest direct couplings to the higgs fields , they are the most relevant superpartners for the hierarchy problem .",
    "naturalness arguments strongly prefer them to be light , independent of any particular susy scenario .",
    "therefore , they have been the focus of intensive experimental and phenomenological investigations nowadays",
    ".    studies of stop searches have been performed by many groups in various ( fully hadronic , single - lepton , di - lepton ) channels in recent years @xcite .",
    "the lhc has done dedicated stop searches @xcite , but so far has not found any evidence for the stop particles . as the fine tuning in the higgs sector increases with the stop mass , an intriguing possibility is that the stop is not very heavy , but the mass spectrum of the stop and other lighter superpartners is somewhat compressed and the event signals from stop decay do not look very different from the sm backgrounds . in that case ,",
    "simple variables often used in susy searches , such as @xmath3 and the effective mass , are usually not very helpful in discriminating signals from backgrounds .",
    "it is therefore desirable to look for more sophisticated variables which may have more discriminating power . in this paper , we focus on such scenarios , where the mass difference between the stop and neutralino is close to or smaller than the top mass . in this case , the decay of the stop to a bottom quark and a chargino can be dominant , since the decay to a top and a neutralino is closed or phase - space suppressed .",
    "we only consider model - independent direct stop pair production by assuming all other colored superpartners are heavy .",
    "the signal event topology that we study is then a symmetric decay chain in which a pair of stops both decay through a chargino , which decays into a stable neutralino plus a @xmath4 gauge boson .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the di - leptonic channel , in which both @xmath4-bosons ( from the decay of charginos ) decay to a lepton - neutrino pair .",
    "the atlas collaboration at the lhc has done such a search with @xmath5 of data at 8 tev  @xcite ( and an update with @xmath6  @xcite just appeared while we finalize our paper ) . in that analysis ,",
    "an @xmath0@xcite variable defined with the leptons , is the primary variable throughout the analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 of leptons has an end point around @xmath7 for the @xmath8 background , and in general has a strong correlation with the @xmath9 s of the leptons .",
    "hence , it is very useful when the signal has harder leptons than the background does . however , depending on the mass spectrum , the signal does not necessarily have harder leptons , especially for the compressed scenario .",
    "it is important to explore different regions of parameter space , including those regions that would produce soft leptons ( but maybe hard @xmath10-jets ) , which would in general require different strategies and kinematic variables . in this paper",
    "we choose a few representative points in the parameter space with different characteristics and try to identify the best strategy for each case .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , we present the sample signal spectra , and describe the details of event simulations and basic selections . in sec .  [",
    "sec : newvariables ] , we define many kinematic variables which can be constructed from the kinematic information of the events . the distributions of the signals and the background in these variables are shown so that we can see which variables can be useful for different mass spectra . in sec .",
    "[ sec : performance ] , we perform a detailed study of these kinematic variables one by one and also in combinations to compare their performances in various scenarios .",
    "we identify the best variables and strategies for each of the sample spectra .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : topmix ] , we show how the results change when some nonzero branching fraction of the stop decay through the top quark and the neutralino is included .",
    "some details of the definition and computation of a new set of variables are described in appendix  [ app : dd ] .",
    "the stop particles can be produced in pairs at the lhc via the qcd interaction .",
    "if @xmath2-parity is conserved , they will decay into other lighter @xmath2-parity odd superpartners . in this paper , we assume that some of the neutralinos and charginos are lighter than the stop and focus on the challenging scenario with a relatively small mass difference between the lightest stop and the lightest neutralino : @xmath11 .",
    "if the mass difference is large , the visible decay products will be very energetic and easily distinguishable from the sm backgrounds , then the search is mostly limited by the production rate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spectrum is highly degenerate , the decay products may be too soft to pass the triggers or experimental cuts .",
    "one has to rely on the mono - jet search to place bounds in that case . assuming a light chargino sitting in between the stop and neutralino masses , @xmath12 , the dominant decay channel of the stop is likely to be @xmath13 with the chargino @xmath14 decaying into @xmath15 plus an on - shell or off - shell @xmath4 gauge boson .",
    "concentrating on the case of leptonic decays for both @xmath4 bosons , we have the signal final state to be @xmath16 . the detailed feynman diagram for the di - leptonic stop signal is shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] . in our study , we focus on the @xmath8 background , and look for suitable kinematic variables which can effectively separate the signal from the @xmath8 background in order to improve the stop search in this channel .",
    "the @xmath10-jet and lepton momenta in the final state follow from the two mass differences : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the equivalent mass differences for the @xmath19 background are @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are fixed by the top and @xmath4 masses . as a consequence",
    ", we anticipate that for different spectra one may use different kinetic variables to improve the search . to illustrate this point , we study several representative spectra based on whether the @xmath10-jet and the lepton are harder or softer in the final state .",
    "we choose two different mass gaps between the stop and the neutralino .",
    "the first one has @xmath22  gev , which is close to the top quark mass .",
    "the other one has @xmath23  gev with a smaller mass gap than that of the top background and generically softer leptons and @xmath10-jets . for each fixed mass gap between the stop and the neutralino",
    ", we study three different cases with the chargino mass close to the stop mass , close to the neutralino mass , or at a point with similar mass differences as the @xmath4 gauge boson mass between the top and the neutrino masses .",
    "the six sets of masses are shown in table  [ tab : spectrum ] , where we label the six different spectra from s1 to s6 .",
    "we also highlight the characteristic features of the @xmath10-jet and lepton momenta by comparing them to the momenta in the @xmath19 background .",
    "we choose the mass differences such that even for softer @xmath10-jets or leptons , a significant fraction of them can still pass the cuts and register in the signal events , otherwise alternative search strategies will be needed .",
    "all of these six spectra are not ruled out by the atlas search at 8  tev with 13  fb@xmath24 , although the spectrum s3 may have been excluded by the 21  fb@xmath24 update  @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize that the current search strategies at atlas  @xcite using the @xmath0 variable constructed from the harder leptons will only be sensitive to the s3-like spectra . for other type of spectra ,",
    "different variables are generally required to distinguish the signal from the background .",
    "we will come back to this point in section  [ sec : performance ] .",

    "in this appendix we give a detailed definition of the `` compatible - masses '' variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 and describe how to calculate them .",
    "we consider pair production of some particle @xmath27 , and each of which goes through two - step decays .",
    "it first decays to an intermediate particle @xmath28 plus a visible particle and then @xmath28 decays to an invisible particle @xmath29 and another visible particle . the process is shown in fig .",
    "[ app : fig1 ] , which also exhibits how we label the particles .",
    "the masses of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are denoted as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , that will be treated as unknowns .",
    "particles @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are visible and whose 4-momenta can be experimentally measured . for a set of test values of @xmath37 , we can solve for the 4-momenta of missing particles 1 and 2 when @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are on - shell . to see this ,",
    "let us first focus on one decay chain ( e.g. , the chain with particles @xmath38 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the mass shell conditions are          expanding the 4-momenta the equations can be written explicitly as @xmath45 combining these two equation we can eliminate @xmath46 and express @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 substituting @xmath52 and eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) back into eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) , we obtain a quadratic equaion : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "the quadratic equation ( [ b5 ] ) describes an ellipse in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "we can do the same for the other chain and obtain a similar equation in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which also describes an ellipse in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "we can then use the knowledge of the total missing transverse momentum ( @xmath62 ) to put both ellipses on the same @xmath58 plane , which are describe by two quadratic equations : @xmath63 where for notation simplicity we have written @xmath58 as @xmath64 .",
    "the coefficients are functions of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( or equivalently , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the two quadratic equations render 4 solutions in general which may be complex . in order to have physical ( real ) solutions for the momenta , the two ellipses must intersect .    for a given event , one can check whether a set of trial masses @xmath65 is compatible by testing whether the two ellipses intersect .",
    "this can be done efficiently without solving the actual equations by using the sturm sequence  @xcite , similar to the calculation of @xmath0 in ref .",
    "if we fix @xmath66 ( which is a good assumption for the @xmath8 di - leptonic background since the missing particles are neutrinos ) , we have two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 left and we can scan over the @xmath67 plane to find the compatible region with that particular event , i.e. , any point outside the compatible region does not have physical solution for the kinematics . a typical compatible region for an event is shown in fig .",
    "[ app : fig1 ] .",
    "there are in principle multiple ways to extract useful information or variables from the compatible region .",
    "we consider a simple projection to a pair of variables which are the coordinates of the point at the tip ( with minimum @xmath68 ) of the compatible region .",
    "it can be obtained by scanning over the allowed region to find the point that gives the minimum @xmath69 .",
    "we output the coordinates @xmath67 of that point as our variables .",
    "equivalently , we can also use the radial coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath71 as the independent variables .    for the @xmath8 di - leptonic background ,",
    "particles @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 correspond to the top , @xmath4-boson and neutrino .",
    "the signal does not have the correct topology for this set of variables .",
    "nevertheless , since it has the same signature as the background ( 2 lepton + 2 @xmath10-jets + @xmath3 ) , we can calculate these variables anyway and obtain a set of output values @xmath67 for each event . even for the wrong topology",
    ", these variables still have a strong correlation with the hardness of the @xmath10-jets and leptons .    a detailed description of the calculation of @xmath67 including how to test whether two ellipses intersect , and the computer codes for calculating them can be found at the following website : + `",
