    "in a _ hierarchical approach _ to large genome sequencing , one first breaks many genome copies into random fragments .",
    "a _ library _ is constructed by cloning the fragments , typically as _ bacterial artificial chromosome _ inserts ( bacs ) .",
    "some bacs in the library are selected for complete sequencing .",
    "each selected bac sequence is assembled individually using the shotgun method : a _ subclone _ library is prepared by cloning short fragments of the bac .",
    "subsequently , sequence _ reads _ are produced from a sufficient number of randomly chosen subclones .",
    "the reads are assembled algorithmically into the bac sequence .",
    "an alternative to the hierarchical , or _",
    "clone - by - clone _ , strategy is the _ whole - genome shotgun _ approach  , which employs a few ( essentially 13 ) subclone libraries prepared from the entire genome , without resorting to an intermediate bac library .",
    "the main advantage of the whole - genome approach is that it eliminates the need to prepare tens of thousands of subclone libraries to sequence a mammalian genome .",
    "however , it is generally an inadequate strategy for finishing the assembly of such large repeat - rich genomes . for a review of contemporary sequencing methodologies ,",
    "see , e.g. , .    a new bac - based sequencing strategy , called clone - array pooled shotgun sequencing ( capss ) , was proposed recently  .",
    "capss assembles the complete sequences of individual bacs as does the clone - by - clone approach , but requires a much smaller number of subclone library preparations .",
    "the strategy is currently being applied for the first time on a genome scale in the context of sequencing the honey bee genome .",
    "this paper provides the theory for the design and analysis of pooling - based genome projects .",
    "it also introduces the caps - map method for physical mapping , and transversal pooling designs for both capss and caps - map , thereby laying the theoretical foundation for pooling - based genome - scale sequencing projects .        in a clone - by - clone approach ,",
    "bacs are sequenced independently : one subclone library is constructed for every clone .",
    "in contrast , dna from bacs are pooled together in a capss approach , and subclone libraries are prepared from the pools .",
    "a capss experiment is designed so that the number of subclone libraries is much smaller than the number of clones , yet the pooling design enables the assembly of individual clone sequences . in what follows , by _ pooled shotgun _ ( caps )",
    "sequences we mean shotgun sequence reads collected from a subclone library that was constructed using pooled bacs . for the computational aspects of sequence assembly ,",
    "pooled shotgun sequences are random subsequences originating from a set of clone sequences .    the original capss proposal of relied on a simple rectangular design defined by an array layout of bacs ( figure  [ fig : capss ] ) .",
    "the pools correspond to the rows and columns .",
    "an array layout reduces the number of shotgun library preparations to the square root of the number of bacs when compared to clone - by - clone sequencing .",
    "this reduction can be important in case of a mammalian genome , for which even a minimally overlapping tiling path contains between twenty and thirty thousand clones  .",
    "this paper has two goals .",
    "first , after pointing out some shortcomings of the original capss proposal , we propose algorithmic and experimental improvements that make capss a viable option for sequencing a set of bacs .",
    "specifically , we apply transversal pooling designs to increase the accuracy of capss , which we previously developed for the pgi method of comparative physical mapping that also uses pooled shotgun sequencing  .",
    "we provide the first probabilistic model of capss sequencing progress .",
    "the model leads to theoretical results supporting previous , less formal arguments on the practicality of capss .",
    "the paper s second goal is to introduce the _ clone - array pooled shotgun mapping ( caps - map ) _ method to detect clone overlaps in a random bac library .",
    "the information on clone overlaps is used to compute the physical ordering of clones in the library , without requiring additional clone fingerprinting .",
    "caps - map operates in the same experimental framework as capss .",
    "it needs only shotgun sequences , which makes it a cost - effective method that can be seamlessly integrated into a sequencing project with very little experimental overhead .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of caps - map for clone overlap detection with a probabilistic analysis .",
    "in addition to the theoretical results , we illustrate the method s performance in a simulated project using the drosophila genome assembly .",
    "it was proposed by that capss be used in hybrid projects , combining whole - genome shotgun ( wgs ) and pooled shotgun ( caps ) sequences .",
    "the motivation is that the pooled shotgun sequences can provide the localization information for the whole - genome shotgun sequences so that the latter can be used for a clone - linked assembly .",
    "after wgs and caps sequences from a set of pools are assembled into contigs , the contigs need to be mapped to individual bacs .",
    "there are a few challenges to contig mapping .",
    "we mention here three main problems : false negatives , ambiguities , and false mapping .",
    "a false negative refers to a situation where a bac is not sampled in a pool it is included in , due to the low number of caps sequences collected . a false negative for a simple rectangular design means that no contigs can be mapped to the bac .",
    "ambiguities and false mappings are caused by overlapping clones , or more generally , by clones that have highly similar regions .",
    "the mapping of a contig is ambiguous if it is not possible to decide which clones the contig should be assigned to , in cases where two or more clone sets are equally likely choices for the mapping .",
    "false mapping occurs when an insufficient number of caps sequences are collected , and a contig that covers overlapping bacs gets assigned to the wrong clone or clone set .",
    "one strategy used to overcome the mapping problems involves transversal pooling designs  . for a transversal design with  @xmath0 pool sets ,",
    "every clone is included in exactly one pool of each pool set , and any subset with two of those pools uniquely identifies the clone .",
    "half of the pool sets are designated as column pools , and the other half as row pools to realize the design with the help of bac arrays . using a transversal double - array design",
    "( i.e. , one with four pool sets ) , the same set of bacs is independently arrayed twice .",
    "each of the two resulting arrays contains the same set of bacs .",
    "thus , each bac ends up being sampled in two column - pools and two row - pools .",
    "one of the arrays contains an arbitrary arrangement of bacs , while the other is `` reshuffled '' relative to the first .",
    "more generally , clones can be arranged on  @xmath1 reshuffled arrays using a transversal pooling design with  @xmath2 pool sets .",
    "the number of arrays in a transversal design may be adjusted to allow unambiguous and correct contig mapping for any redundancy in a bac library .",
    "specifically , it can be shown   that a @xmath1-array transversal design can accurately resolve bacs at up to @xmath3x redundancy .",
    "we previously described and analyzed transversal designs in the context of pooled shotgun experiments   and compared their performance to other designs .",
    "even though our analysis was performed for the pooled genomic indexing ( pgi ) method in the context of comparative physical mapping , the results are generally valid for capss and caps - map as well .",
    "specifically , our results indicate that transversal designs reduce the frequency of false negatives and false mappings when compared to a simple rectangular design . furthermore , when compared to other more complicated designs , they achieve an optimal balance between the number of shotgun library preparations and the frequency of contig mapping problems .",
    "transversal designs also enjoy a practical advantage over more complicated combinatorial designs , in that they are readily implemented using existing automated clone arraying technologies .",
    "when a transversal design is used , contig mapping can be implemented very efficiently , based on an algorithm that runs in  @xmath4 time for mapping  @xmath5 contigs onto  @xmath6 bacs . without going into details , the main idea is to first build in  @xmath7 time a hash table that maps pool pairs to bacs .",
    "based on the property of transversal designs that two pools identify a clone , this table contains all pool pairs that identify a unique clone .",
    "for each contig , it takes  @xmath8 time using the hash table to either identify the most likely clone set to which the contig can be mapped , or to declare the contig ambiguous .",
    "this section analyzes capss progress in a hybrid project that uses whole - genome and pooled shotgun sequences .",
    "caps sequences are collected using a transversal design with  @xmath0 pool sets , i.e. , @xmath9 arrays . in order to derive a probabilistic model for such experiments , we introduce some standard simplifying assumptions and the following notations .",
    "assume that every clone has the same length  @xmath10 ( 100200 thousand base pairs in practice ) , and that each shotgun sequence has the same length  @xmath11 ( e.g. , 500 bp ) .",
    "the wgs and caps sequences are combined and compared to each other to find overlaps between them .",
    "overlapping sequences form _",
    "islands_. islands with two or more sequences are _",
    "an overlap between two shotgun sequences is detected if it is at least of length  @xmath12 where  @xmath13 .",
    "statistics for islands , and gaps between islands are well known  .",
    "we are interested in statistics for _ clone - linked contigs _ , those that are assigned to bacs using the pooling information .",
    "let  @xmath14 be the coverage by caps sequences , i.e. , if  @xmath15 caps sequences are collected , then  @xmath16 where  @xmath6 is the total number of clones .",
    "let  @xmath17 denote the coverage by wgs sequences , i.e. , if  @xmath18 wgs sequences are collected , then  @xmath19 where  @xmath20 is the genome length .",
    "notice that  @xmath21 is possible .",
    "here we consider the simplest case of assembling the sequence of a single clone that does not overlap with any other clone .",
    "such a clone is covered by a total coverage of  @xmath22 .",
    "although we concentrate on sequencing a particular clone , the transversal design allows the simultaneous sequencing of multiple , possibly overlapping clones by combining wgs sequences with caps sequences from many ( or even all ) pools .",
    "regions of overlapping clones have higher coverage since they are covered by more caps sequences than a single clone .",
    "the sequencing of overlapping regions progresses thus faster than what is suggested by the statistics for a single clone .",
    "we examine the case of assigning contigs to overlapping bacs in  [ sec : capsmap ] .",
    "two shotgun sequences from different pools suffice to assign a contig to a single bac . in a practical setting",
    ", it may be advantageous to require more stringent criteria in order to avoid false mappings .",
    "theorem  [ tm : capss ] can be readily adapted for such criteria , albeit resulting in bulkier formulas .",
    "figures  [ fig : capss.islands ] and  [ fig : capss.cover ] compare different experimental designs based on theorem  [ tm : capss ] and simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : capss.islands ] plots the island statistics from the theorem .",
    "it illustrates that for lower coverages ( about @xmath23 ) , the ratio of pooled shotgun sequences makes a large difference in the sequencing .",
    "this difference is mainly shown in the number of clone - linked contigs , as the contig sizes do not differ much . at large coverage levels , when sequencing is nearly completed , the impact of pooled sequences is less , i.e. , wgs sequences can make up for a lower pooled coverage",
    ".    figure  [ fig : capss.cover]a shows that while more arrays increase the sequencing success , the improvements are very small after the second array . notice that if the clones are selected from a minimally overlapping tiling path , then no part of the genome is covered by more than two bacs , and thus two arrays suffice for the unambiguous mapping of all contigs that cover clone overlaps .",
    "figure  [ fig : capss.cover]b plots the n50 values .",
    "the n50 contig length is the value  @xmath24 such that half of the sequenced nucleotides belong to contigs of length at least  @xmath24 .",
    "the statistics for all designs converge to those of a non - pooled sequencing project as the coverage increases . in other words , the negative effects of pooling diminish and the project",
    "progresses just as without pooling : for example , at total coverage 45x , 99% of the clone is sequenced .",
    "[ tm : capss ] let  @xmath25 where  @xmath26 is the fraction of length two shotgun sequences must share in order for the overlap to be detected . consider a bac that does not overlap with other clones",
    "define  @xmath27 , the total coverage .",
    "let @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for  @xmath31 .    1 .",
    "the expected number of clone - linked contigs covering the clone equals @xmath32 where @xmath33 2 .",
    "the expected number of shotgun sequences in a clone - linked contig is @xmath34 3 .",
    "define @xmath35 the expected length of a clone - linked contig can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is bounded as @xmath38 furthermore , when  @xmath39 is kept constant , @xmath40 increases monotonically with  @xmath41 and @xmath42    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     bacs were ordered within each bactig . for every bactig , an overlap matrix  @xmath43 was calculated , in which the rows correspond to the bactig s clones , the columns correspond to the contigs linked to at least one bactig clone , and @xmath44=1 $ ] if contig  @xmath45 is linked to clone  @xmath46 , otherwise @xmath44=0 $ ] .",
    "the following traveling salesperson ( tsp ) formulation is used to find the correct column permutation .",
    "we search for a tour in a graph , in which every vertex corresponds to a contig ( and thus a column ) , with an additional vertex  @xmath47 .",
    "the weight of an edge between vertices  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 , corresponding to contigs  @xmath45 and  @xmath50 , is the number of rows in which they differ : @xmath51\\ne\\mathbf{m}[i , j']\\bigr\\}$ ] , where  @xmath52 is the indicator function .",
    "the weight of an edge between  @xmath48 and  @xmath47 is the sum of ones in the column  @xmath45 that corresponds to  @xmath48 : @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "now , a hamilton path with the minimum weight in this graph gives the best column permutation in the sense that it minimizes the number of gaps between blocks of ones within rows @xcite .",
    "the best row ordering could be found in an analogous manner , but we used a simpler method which worked better in practice .",
    "clones are ordered relatively to the contig order by placing clone  @xmath54 before  @xmath55 if the first contig @xmath54 is linked to is before the first contig @xmath55 is linked to , or if their first contigs are identical but @xmath54 has its last contig before @xmath55 .",
    "we used the ` concorde ` program to solve the tsp instances .",
    "the resulting row permutation is then further analyzed to find clones , for which the permutation arbitrarily enforces an order .",
    "specifically , if consecutive rows of the permuted matrix  @xmath56 are identical , then the order of the corresponding clones is not resolved .",
    "subsequently , we compared the tsp orders to the true orders , which is known since the bac sequences are generated artificially .",
    "figure  [ fig : fly.order ] shows the outcome of the comparison for two bactigs .",
    "the tsp order is very close to the true order .",
    "the experimental expedience of shotgun sequencing has been essential for the success of genome - scale sequencing projects in the past decade .",
    "the power of the concept comes from the now established fact that the loss of information about read localization incurred by random subcloning can be largely recovered in the assembly step using sequence information .",
    "clone pooling is similar in spirit to shotgun sequencing in that it introduces experimental expedience by dramatically reducing the number of subclone library preparations .",
    "the clone pooling step leads to a temporary loss of information about localization of shotgun sequences on individual bac clones .",
    "we have demonstrated that sequence information can be used to successfully recover most of the information lost in pooling .",
    "our analyses presented here indicate the theoretical feasibility of the caps - map method and provide guidance for the design of genome - scale caps - map experiments .",
    "in particular , our analysis indicates that transversal pooling designs can accommodate high levels of clone redundancy and perform well even at low levels of shotgun sequence coverage of clone pools .",
    "practical biological and technical considerations may set a limit to the array size . in case of large genomes",
    ", the limitations may imply that the set of bacs is partitioned and that pooling is applied separately to individual subsets .",
    "this results in a lower clone redundancy within individual arrays and a larger number of pools .",
    "our analysis allows for the partitioning of clones .",
    "it also allows for the possibility of including whole - genome shotgun sequence reads .",
    "it thus covers realistic and practical scenarios of the capss and caps - map methods application .",
    "we are grateful to richard gibbs and george weinstock for sharing pre - publication information on capss and for useful comments .",
