    "the masses and radii of stars are two fundamental parameters in stellar astrophysics .",
    "accurate mass determinations of b  type stars still are urgently required , since actual masses are based on a very small number of eclipsing binaries . data of this kind are important for tests of stellar models , with far - reaching implications such as modelling of stellar components of galaxies . our main motivations to study this system to explain the nature of the b - star binary hd194495 .",
    "this effort is part of an ongoing research to determine the masses and radii of such systems .",
    "the star hd194495 was classified as b7v single - lined , massive spectroscopic binary by @xcite . system consists of an evolved , more massive , and more luminous primary component and a main sequence secondary star .",
    "it has an eccentric orbit ( @xmath13=0.14 ) and an orbital period of 4.90 days .",
    "several radial velocity measurements of primary component of hd194495 by @xcite show range from -80 kms@xmath14 to 100 kms@xmath14 , but no further investigations were made into this probable velocity variable and radial velocity of the second component measurements .",
    "the eclipsing nature of its light curve was first noticed with the @xmath3 satellite ( hip100719 ) and later @xmath15 photometric survey ( asas202511 + 2129.3 ) where it was classified as an @xmath16 eclipsing binary and known as v399vulpecula @xcite .    as one of only a few eclipsing b - star binary hd194495 provides a potentially important system because it is a test case for stellar structure and evolution models .",
    "it is critical that well - determined values for the current separation and component masses be determined . in this paper",
    ", we use the optical spectra of hd194495 to reveal the nature of its light variability and physical properties in combination with the photometric data obtained by hipparcos and asas-3 as well as with the our reconstruction of spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the spectroscopic observations , data analysis , temperature estimations , reddening and reconstruction of spectra are described .",
    "derived absolute parameters of the stars from the combination spectroscopic and photometric results are given in  3 .",
    "we compare the individual masses based on the spectroscopic and photometric orbits to those predicted by theoretical methods and discuss their implications in  4 .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been performed with the chelle spectrograph ( fresco ) at the 91-cm telescope of catania astrophysical observatory . the spectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fibre ( @xmath17@xmath18 , 100 @xmath19 m core diameter ) and is located , in a stable position , in the room below the dome level .",
    "spectra were recorded on a ccd camera equipped with a thinned back  illuminated site ccd of 1k@xmath201k pixels ( size 24@xmath2024 @xmath19 m ) .",
    "the cross - dispersed chelle configuration yields a resolving power @xmath21=@xmath22=22000 , as deduced from the full width at half maximum of the lines of the th  ar calibration lamp .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range from 4300 to 6650  , split into 19 orders . in this spectral region , and in particular in the blue portion of the spectrum , there are several lines useful for the measure of radial velocity , as well as for spectral classification of the stars .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the chelle task of iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum given by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "seventeen spectra of hd194495 were collected during the 20 observing nights between august 14 and september 22 , 2007 .",
    "typical exposure times for the hd194495 spectroscopic observations were between 2400 and 2600 s. the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath23 ) achieved was between 70 and 120 , depending on atmospheric condition .",
    "@xmath24 lyr ( a0v ) , 59 her ( a3iv ) , @xmath25 psc ( f7v ) , hd 27962 ( a2iv ) , and @xmath26 her ( b5iv ) were observed during each run as radial velocity and/or rotational velocity templates .",
    "the average @xmath23 at continuum in the spectral region of interest was 150200 for the standard stars .",
    ".radial velocities of the components of hd194495 .",
    "the columns give the heliocentric julian date , the orbital phase , the radial velocities of the two components with the corresponding errors , and the average s / n of the spectrum .

    "combination of the parameters obtained from light curves and rvs yield the absolute dimensions of the system , which are presented in table5",
    ". the standard deviations of the parameters have been determined by jktabsdimjkt / codes.html ] code , which calculates distance and other physical parameters using several different sources for bolometric corrections @xcite .",
    "the mass and radii of the components were estimated with uncertainities of 1 % .",
    "an inspection of the temperatures , masses and radii of the component stars reveals a binary system composed of two main - sequence stars .",
    "the temperature @xmath27 k , mass @xmath28 m@xmath29 and radius @xmath30 r@xmath29 of the primary are consistent with the spectral type of b3 , and the temperature @xmath31 k , mass @xmath32 m@xmath29 and radius @xmath33 r@xmath29 of the secondary are consistent with an b4v spectral type star .        using the two @xmath34 values derived from photometric and spectroscopic data we calculated the de  reddening distance modulus of the system . to estimate the bolometric magnitudes of the components we adopted m@xmath35=4.74 mag for the sun . using the bolometric corrections given by @xcite and @xcite we",
    "estimate the distance to the system as 274 and 269 pc , respectively , with an uncertainity of 5 pc .",
    "however , the average distance to the system is estimated to be 290@xmath36 pc from the trigonometric parallax measured by the hipparcos mission .    to compare the distance of hd194495 using a different method we used a luminosity - colour relation @xcite , which has been constructed for binary systems with main - sequence components .",
    "this method calculates the color excess ( @xmath37 ) in the direction and the distance of the hd194495 using @xcite maps ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced color excess in direction of the hd194495 is calculated e@xmath38(b - v)=0.072 .",
    "the near - infrared magnitudes of the system were taken from the 2mass point sources catalogue of @xcite and are shown in table 5 .",
    "the colour excess @xmath39 was estimated in direction of hd194495 by using equivalenth width of the interstellar lines .",
    "the near - infrared absolute magnitude of hd194495 system was estimated by the luminosity - colour relation , @xmath40 , of @xcite and the distance of the system is calculated as 274@xmath58 pc by using the photometric parallaxes method .",
    "the photometric distance of 274@xmath58 pc given in table 5 is consistent with the 269@xmath58 pc and 290@xmath58 pc distance estimated by studiying of the interstellar lines and the hipparcos measurements , respectively .",
    "we have presented the results of the masses and radii of the stars in the hd194495 system to great accuracy and also a photometric solution of the system .",
    "the results of the light and radial velocity curves analysis of the allows to derive the absolute parameters of the system . we have determined the masses and radii of the two stars to 1% for the primary and secondary star .",
    "the resulting parameters of hd194495 are given in table5 . as is seen in table5 , both stars of the system are well within their roche radii but experience tidal distortion that is evident in the v - band light curve ( figure4 ) .",
    "the rotational velocities derived from the reconstructions ( table3 ) very well match with the synchronous rotation values found from analysis .",
    "therefore , this system has achieved synchronous rotation , and is not very young .    in order to discuss the evolutionary status of the components of the system ,",
    "the locations of two stars were plotted on hertzsprung ",
    "russell ( h  r ) diagram . in this hr diagram ( figure5 ) plotted against evolutionary tracks for stars of 5 , 7 , and 9 @xmath7 from @xcite , as well as isochrones from @xcite for solar metallicity with ages of 20 , 25 , 28 , and 32myr .",
    "the location of the stars is most consistent with an age of @xmath4128 myr .",
    "the positions of the components of the system appear in figure5 to be overluminous for the derived masses of @xmath42 m@xmath29 for the primary and @xmath43 m@xmath29 for the secondary .",
    "table15.7 of @xcite gives the astrophysical parameters for stars of the various spectral classes .",
    "the mass and effective temperature of the primary fit between the listed values for spectral types b3 ( 7.6m@xmath29 ) and b4 ( @xmath41 6.8m@xmath29 ) , but the radius is much larger than the means for comparable spectral types and matches a b3 star ( 4.8r@xmath29 ) .",
    "@xcite found several systems of comparable mass that , like hd194495 , are overluminous compared with model predictions for eclipsing binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "however , the results for hd194495 seem to conflict with the results of @xcite , who showed that early b - type stars that are in close systems and rotate more slowly than single stars are on average smaller than those same single stars .",
    "@xcite also studied well separated binaries in an effort to use the properties of their component stars for a more direct comparison with single stars .",
    "the mass  luminosity  radius relations in his study , when applied to our results for hd194495 , predict less - luminous , hotter , and smaller components .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , due to the age of hd194495 and the evolution of its components from the zero - age main sequence .",
    "to study the kinematical properties of hd194495 , we used the system s center - of - mass velocity , distance and proper motion values , which are given in table 5 .",
    "the proper motion data were taken from newly reduced hipparcos catalogue @xcite , whereas the center - of - mass velocity and distance are obtained in this study .",
    "the system s space velocity was calculated using @xcite algorithm .",
    "the u , v and w space velocity components and their errors were obtained and given in table 5 . to obtain the space velocity precisely the first - order galactic differential rotation correction was taken into account @xcite , and -1.08 and 0.65 kms@xmath14 differential corrections were applied to u and v space velocity components , respectively .",
    "the w velocity is not affected in this first - order approximation .",
    "as for the lsr correction , @xcite values ( 9 , 12 , 7)@xmath29 kms@xmath14 were used and the final space velocity of hd194495 was obtained as @xmath44 kms@xmath14 .",
    "this value is in agreement with other young stars space velocities given in the criterion from @xcite for young disc stars -50 @xmath45 u @xmath45 20 , -30 @xmath45 v @xmath45 0 , -25 @xmath45 w @xmath45 10 .    to determine the population type of hd194495 the galactic orbit of the system",
    "was examined . using @xcite n - body code , the system s apogalactic ( @xmath46 ) and perigalactic ( @xmath47 ) distances",
    "were obtained as 7.88 and 8.81 kpc , respectively . also ,",
    "the maximum possible vertical separation from the galactic plane is @xmath48=50 pc for the system .",
    "when determining the ellipticity the following formula was used :    @xmath49    the ellipticity was calculated as @xmath50 .",
    "this value shows that hd194495 is orbiting the galaxy in an almost circular orbit and that the system belongs to the young thin - disc population .",
