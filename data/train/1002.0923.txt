    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,  violation occurs due to an irreducible phase appearing in the quark - flavor mixing matrix , called the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which relates the weak interaction eigenstates to that of mass .",
    "the study of @xmath0 meson decays allows us to carry out a multitude of measurements involving the angles and sides of the so - called unitarity triangle ( ut ) , a graphical sketch of the unitarity of the ckm matrix in the complex plane .",
    "raison dtre _ of the two @xmath0-factory experiments  belle at kek , japan and babar at slac , usa  was to precisely measure various ut parameters . by doing so",
    ", they were designed to verify the  violation mechanism within the sm , as suggested by kobayashi and maskawa  @xcite , and to set constraints on potential new physics contributions in the flavor sector .    in these proceedings , we summarize recent results on  violation , involving three angles of the unitarity triangle , and describe a number of hints for new physics observed with the @xmath0-factory experiments .",
    "the ut angles are determined through the measurement of the time dependent  asymmetry , @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3-n[b^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp } ] }                    { n[\\bbar^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp}]+n[b^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp } ] } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] is the number of @xmath5s that decay into a  eigenstate @xmath6 after time @xmath7 .",
    "the asymmetry , in general , can be expressed in terms of two components : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the difference in mass of @xmath10 mass eigenstates .",
    "the sine coefficient @xmath11 is related to the ut angles , while the cosine coefficient @xmath12 is a measure of direct  violation . for the latter to have a nonzero value ,",
    "we need at least two competing amplitudes with different weak and strong phase to contribute to the decay final state . as an example , for the decay @xmath13 , where mostly one diagram contributes , the cosine term is expected to vanish and the sine term is proportional to the ut angle @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , that correspond to @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , is equally abundant in the literature . ] .",
    "the time - dependent  asymmetry is , therefore , given as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the  eigenvalue of the final state .",
    "in the case of @xmath0 factories , the measurement of @xmath2 utilizes decays of the  into two neutral @xmath0 mesons , of which one can be completely reconstructed into a  eigenstate , while the decay products of the other ( called the tag @xmath0 ) identify its flavor at decay time .",
    "the time difference @xmath7 between the two @xmath0 decays is determined by reconstructing their decay vertices .",
    "finally the  asymmetry amplitudes , proportional to the ut angles , are obtained from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the proper time distributions separately for events tagged as @xmath21 and @xmath10 .",
    "the most precise measurement of the angle @xmath14 is obtained from a study of the decays @xmath22 charmonium @xmath23 .",
    "these decays , known as `` golden modes '' , mainly proceed via the ckm - favored tree diagram @xmath24 with an internal @xmath25 boson emission . the subleading penguin ( loop )",
    "contribution to the final state , that has a different weak phase compared to the tree diagram , is suppressed by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "this makes @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] to a very good approximation .",
    "besides the theoretical simplicity , these channels also offer experimental advantages because of the relatively large branching fractions ( @xmath27 ) and the presence of narrow resonances in the final state , which provides a powerful rejection against combinatorial background .",
    "the  eigenstates considered for this analysis include @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the measured world - average value of @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ sin2phi1 ] shows the impact of this measurement by belle and babar , that eventually led to half of the 2008 physics nobel prize  @xcite being awarded to kobayashi and maskawa , when compared to other experiments .     from all experiments , as compiled by the hfag  @xcite .",
    "]      decays of @xmath0 mesons to the final states @xmath35 ( @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , dominated by the ckm - suppressed @xmath38 transition , are sensitive to the ut angle @xmath17 .",
    "the presence of @xmath39 penguin diagrams , however , complicates the situation by introducing additional phases such that the measured parameter is no more @xmath17 alone , rather an effective value @xmath40 .",
    "( note that the same prescription _ vis - a - vis _ penguin pollution also applies to other ut angles , wherever appropriate . ) at present , the most precise measurement of this angle is obtained in the analysis of the decays @xmath41 .",
    "combining with additional constraints coming from @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we measure @xmath44  @xcite .      the angle @xmath18 is measured by exploiting the interference between the decays @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where both @xmath47 and @xmath48 decay to a common final state .",
    "this measurement can be performed in three different ways : utilizing decays of @xmath49 mesons to  eigenstates  @xcite , making use of doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays of the @xmath49 meson  @xcite , and exploiting the interference pattern in the dalitz plot of @xmath50 decays  @xcite .",
    "currently , the last method provides the strongest constraint on @xmath18 .",
    "combining all related measurements from belle and babar , the world - average value is found to be @xmath51  @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ ckmfitresult ] we summarize the constraints on the ut coming from the measurements of angles only , as well as after including other experimental inputs . to a very good approximation , the kobayashi - maskawa formalism is found to be the right description of  violation in the sm .",
    "needless to say that we still need to improve the precision on the third angle @xmath18 ",
    "one has just made a head - start !",
    "similarly , we expect the errors on other two angles to shrink further , _",
    "e.g. _ , once belle analyzes its full  dataset .",
    "in this section we attempt to enumerate various hints for , or constraints on , potential new physics contributions , as observed with the @xmath0 factories .",
    "as @xmath33 is the most precisely measured observable concerning  violation in @xmath0 decays , we can use it as a `` standard candle '' to set constraints on new physics by looking for possible deviations from this value in a number of ways .",
    "one such is the comparison of the values of @xmath52 measured in penguin dominated decays with the world - average value of @xmath33 , coming from decays involving charmonium final states .",
    "the caveat to making such a comparison is that the penguin modes may have additional topologies that could lead to a difference between @xmath33 and @xmath52 .",
    "if these sm corrections , @xmath53 , are well known then any residual difference @xmath54 would be from new physics .",
    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that by comparing the penguin to tree channels one remains insensitive to possible new physics contribution common to both .",
    "therefore , it is important to compare the directly measured values of @xmath52 with the predictions of sm - based constraints for the same observable .",
    "figure  [ adrian ] summarizes the different constraints on @xmath52 , where the maximum difference between the measured and indirect values has a significance above @xmath55 standard deviations .     in ( yellow / light - shaded )",
    "charmonium decays , ( blue / dark - shaded ) penguin decays , and ( green / medium - shaded ) inferred from indirect measurements  @xcite . ]",
    "both belle and babar have carried out a number of sensitive  violation measurements in various @xmath0 decays .",
    "most notable of them is the decay @xmath56 , where direct  violation has been established beyond any doubt ",
    "the measured  asymmetry is @xmath57 .",
    "there are a number of interesting evidences at the level of 3 standard deviations in the decays @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "another important result has come out from @xmath63 , with the  asymmetry @xmath64 .",
    "this in contrast to the result of @xmath56  @xcite , where similar feynman diagrams contribute at the tree level , tells us that it could be either due to a large contribution from the color - suppressed tree diagram , or from possible new physics contribution in the electroweak penguin , or from both . before firmly concluding anything ,",
    "it is suggested  @xcite to check the  violation result from the decay @xmath65 , with a larger dataset .      for",
    "a @xmath0 meson decaying to two vector particles , @xmath66 , theoretical models based on qcd factorization  @xcite or perturbative qcd  @xcite predict the fraction of longitudinal fraction @xmath67 to be approximately @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mass of the vector ( @xmath0 ) meson , for tree - dominated decays . as an example , in the case of @xmath41 the prediction for @xmath67 is close to @xmath70 , which matches well with the measurement  @xcite . for decays dominated by the penguin transition",
    ", however , there is a large discrepancy between predictions ( @xmath71 ) and observations , that tend to cluster around @xmath72 .",
    "this unexpected result on polarization , mostly driven by the measurement of @xmath73 , has motivated several further studies .",
    "decays proceed via the annihilation of quark - antiquark into a @xmath25 boson ( or , potentially into a charged higgs boson ) . ]",
    "the purely leptonic decay @xmath74 provides an excellent probe for the charged higgs that could potentially appear in the annihilation of @xmath75 and @xmath76 quarks similar to the sm diagram , where a @xmath77 boson is created in the annihilation process ( see fig .",
    "[ taunu ] ) . for instance , if we take the prediction of the two - higgs doublet model  @xcite , the observed branching fraction could be enhanced or suppressed by a factor of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mass of the charged higgs and @xmath80 is the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values . on the experimental side , identifying the decay @xmath81 , which involves at least two neutrinos in the final state , is a real challenge . both belle and babar have made the best use of their detector hermiticity and particle identification capability , and in doing so they obtain  @xcite a branching fraction world - average of @xmath82 for the decay .",
    "the sm prediction is @xmath83 , where the dominant uncertainties come from the error in the ckm matrix element @xmath84 and the @xmath0-meson decay constant . comparing the sm expectation with the measurement",
    ", we derive a constraint on @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "this constraint is well complimented by the measurement of @xmath85  @xcite and the inclusive @xmath86 measurement  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the combined result  @xcite , which excludes a charged higgs up to a mass of @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , is already comparable to what is expected for a direct search  @xcite using a @xmath91 data sample at the lhc .      the decay channel @xmath93 is an experimenters delight , since it offers many interesting observables that can be measured in the decays of @xmath0 mesons to both inclusive and exclusive @xmath94 final states , where @xmath95 denotes a strangeness - one meson . in particular , for the exclusive mode @xmath96",
    "the observables include @xmath67 , the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath97 , the isospin asymmetry @xmath98 , and the ratio of rates to @xmath99 and @xmath100 final states ( lepton flavor ratio ) .",
    "recent measurements at the @xmath0 factories  @xcite show that the branching fraction and the lepton flavor ratio agree with sm expectations .",
    "however , a deviation from the sm is indicated in @xmath97 ( fig .  [ afb - belle ] ) , albeit with large statistical uncertainty .",
    "we need more statistics than currently available , which would be possible with the future experiments  @xcite , to either confirm or refute this tantalizing hint .",
