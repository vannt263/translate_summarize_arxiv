    "<S> we present results of a 1.1  mm deep survey of the akari deep field south ( adf - s ) with aztec mounted on the atacama submillimetre telescope experiment ( aste ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a map of 0.25  deg@xmath0 area with an rms noise level of 0.320.71  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the deepest and widest maps thus far at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we uncovered 198 sources with a significance of 3.515.6@xmath1 , providing the largest catalog of 1.1  mm sources in a contiguous region . </S>",
    "<S> most of the sources are not detected in the far - infrared bands of the _ akari _ satellite , suggesting that they are mostly at @xmath2 given the detection limits . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed differential and cumulative number counts in the adf - s , the subaru/_xmm newton _ deep field ( sxdf ) , and the ssa  22 field surveyed by aztec / aste , which provide currently the tightest constraints on the faint end . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the best - fit number counts in the adf - s find that the contribution of 1.1  mm sources with fluxes @xmath31  mjy to the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) at 1.1  mm is 1216% , suggesting that the large fraction of the cib originates from faint sources of which the number counts are not yet constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the cosmic star - formation rate density contributed by 1.1  mm sources with @xmath31  mjy using the best - fit number counts in the adf - s and find that it is lower by about a factor of 510 compared to those derived from uv / optically - selected galaxies at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of stellar mass of the present - day universe produced by 1.1  mm sources with @xmath31  mjy at @xmath5 is @xmath620% , calculated by the time integration of the star - formation rate density . if we consider the recycled fraction of @xmath70.4 , which is the fraction of materials forming stars returned to the interstellar medium , the fraction of stellar mass produced by 1.1  mm sources decrease to @xmath810% .    </S>",
