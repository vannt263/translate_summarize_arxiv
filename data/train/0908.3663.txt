    "the electroweak phase transition may give rise to a variety of cosmological relics such as the baryon asymmetry of the universe , cosmic magnetic fields , inhomogeneities or gravitational waves . to be observable ,",
    "some of these relics depend on the strength of the phase transition .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) and gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "both can be generated in the electroweak phase transition , and both require a strongly first - order phase transition . in a first - order phase transition , bubbles of the stable broken - symmetry phase nucleate at a temperature @xmath2 below the critical temperature @xmath3 , and grow inside the supercooled symmetric phase .",
    "the expansion of bubbles provides the required departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "gravitational waves are generated by the collisions of bubble walls and by the turbulence they produce @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "bubble walls with higher velocities will generate gws of larger amplitudes .",
    "for electroweak baryogenesis @xcite , the violation of baryon number must be suppressed in the broken - symmetry phase in order to avoid the wash - out of the generated bau .",
    "this puts a condition on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field in that phase , namely , @xmath4 .",
    "this quantity is the order parameter of the phase transition , and the above condition implies that the phase transition must be strongly first - order .",
    "the amplitude of the baryon asymmetry also depends on the wall velocity .",
    "however , unlike the case of gravitational waves , the bau has a maximum for wall velocities in the range @xmath5 , depending on the model @xcite .",
    "for higher velocities the sphaleron processes do not have enough time to produce baryons , whereas for lower velocities equilibrium is restored and the generated baryon number is washed - out .",
    "the low velocities required for baryogenesis seem to be too small to generate observable gravitational radiation .    for baryogenesis calculations the wall velocity",
    "is often assumed to be of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath6where @xmath7 is the net pressure acting on the wall , i.e. , the pressure difference between the two phases , and @xmath8 is a friction coefficient .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the case of subsonic walls , which propagate as _ deflagrations_. in the context of gravitational waves , on the contrary , the wall is generally assumed to propagate as a _ detonation _ @xcite .",

    "this condition demands a _ weak enough _ phase transition , how weak depending on the friction .",
    "these two conditions may restrict significantly the parameters of the theory .",
    "models with extra bosons which are strongly coupled to the higgs have been extensively considered , since they easily give strongly first - order phase transitions . however , in our examples we have seen that these models also tend to give quite large wall velocities . for extensions with scalar singlets , we obtained in all the cases @xmath438 for @xmath439 , and even larger ( @xmath440 ) if tree - level cubic terms are allowed .",
    "for the mssm with a light stop we also obtained rather large velocities , @xmath441 . on the other hand ,",
    "extensions with fermions are not usually taken into account because they tend to weaken the phase transition .",
    "however , models with fermions can give strong enough phase transitions , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of fermions with large yukawa coupling @xmath138 and heavier stabilizing bosons . for this model , with @xmath442 given by eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) , we see that the wall velocity can be as small as @xmath443 for @xmath402 ( see figs .",
    "[ figfer ] and [ figfermu ] ) .    due to the approximations used in the calculation of the friction coefficient",
    ", the error in the wall velocity is an @xmath444 factor . with a larger friction",
    ", extensions with bosons may give velocities @xmath445 for @xmath402 .",
    "in any case , it is clear that values of @xmath446 and @xmath144 which are appropriate for baryogenesis are more easily obtained in models in which the dynamics is dominated by fermions .",
    "if the friction is smaller than our estimate , we will have higher velocities , which favors the generation of gws .",
    "for instance , in the mssm , if we consider a friction coefficient a factor of @xmath447 smaller we obtain deflagrations with @xmath448 and detonations with @xmath449 for @xmath450 .",
    "we have studied the velocity of bubble walls in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we have estimated the friction on the wall due to particles with dispersion relation @xmath451 , for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath138 .",
    "we have discussed analytically the cases of small and large @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
    "we have solved numerically the equations for the wall velocity , taking into account the friction and the hydrodynamics , and we have computed the electroweak wall velocity for several extensions of the standard model .",
    "we have also discussed the implications of our results for baryogenesis and gravitational wave generation .",
    "the friction coefficient , as well as the amount of supercooling , have a strong , nontrivial dependence on the coupling @xmath138 of the particles to the higgs .",
    "furthermore , the friction depends on the bubble wall profile , and thus on the strength of the phase transition .",
    "therefore , the wall velocity is not related to the strength of the transition in a simple way , and the behavior depends on the model .",
    "we have found that in general the velocity increases with the coupling @xmath138 , but it can also decrease ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figsing ] ) .",
    "as we increase the mass parameter @xmath167 , the friction tends to increase for small @xmath167 and to decrease for large @xmath167 .",
    "as we have seen , detonations exist only for high values of @xmath138 and low values of @xmath454 , except in the case in which the strength of the phase transition is due to tree - level effects rather than to loop contributions of extra particles .",
    "we stress that there may be @xmath444 errors in our estimate of the friction coefficient . for non - relativistic velocities",
    "this will not introduce qualitative differences .",
    "however , if a model has deflagrations with velocity close to the speed of sound , a lower friction may cause the detonation solution to exist and the deflagration to disappear . in particular , the interaction rates @xmath125 need to be calculated accurately in each model .",
    "we have also seen that it is difficult to obtain small velocities in phase transitions with @xmath455 .",
    "for instance , the mssm gives velocities in the range @xmath456 , a hidden sector of scalar singlets gives velocities ranging from @xmath434 up to supersonic values , and a tree - level cubic term causes velocities @xmath440 . in these models",
    "the wall velocity is rather large for baryogenesis . on the other hand , such high velocities ( either detonations or deflagrations )",
    "may produce an observable signal of gws .",
    "in contrast , the presence of fermions causes smaller velocities , since they increase the friction without increasing the phase transition strength .",
    "thus , baryogenesis is more likely in models with fermions . in particular , for the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains fermions with large yukawa couplings @xmath138 , we have found velocities in the range @xmath457 for @xmath439 .",
