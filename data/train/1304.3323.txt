    "we start from two - component fermionic atoms with each species indexed by a pseudospin @xmath1 .",

    "the parabolic trapping potential has a variable ellipticity that we associate with a length scale @xmath4 .",
    "the gaussian barrier @xmath5 will split the system into two wells . throughout this paper we set its width with @xmath6 .",
    "we use two complementary techniques to analyze the system : firstly exact diagonalization to expose the full energy spectrum , and secondly perturbation theory to deliver an intuitive description .    in exact diagonalization  @xcite , we work in the eigenbasis of the non - interacting hamiltonian . we express the orbitals in this basis as linear combinations of the gaussian - type orbitals ( gtos )  @xcite of the harmonic trapping potential without the central barrier .",
    "labeling these gtos by the standard quantum numbers @xmath7 , we include @xmath8 and @xmath9 . including basis functions with higher @xmath10 is necessary to capture the effect of the central barrier on the orbitals .    to calculate the orbitals of the non - interacting system including the central barrier we first evaluate the non - interacting hamiltonian matrix in the gto basis .",
    "the matrix elements of the central gaussian barrier can be conveniently expressed in terms of hyper - geometric functions  @xcite .",
    "having calculated the hamiltonian matrix , we diagonalize it to obtain a list of orbitals to use in the subsequent calculation that incorporates the effect of interactions .",
    "we construct the @xmath11 slater determinants with lowest non - interacting energy to use as the many - body basis for our exact diagonalization calculation . to include interactions we evaluate the four - center integrals in the basis of our orbitals and construct the hamiltonian matrix using the slater - condon rules  @xcite . finally , we diagonalize the matrix to find the ground and excited states of the system .    in a cold atom gas",
    "the feshbach resonance is used to tune a contact interaction strength @xmath12 from the repulsive through to the attractive regime . to generate a positive scattering length for a potential with a small effective range we use the square well potential @xmath13 with a radius @xmath14 .",
    "this is significantly less than the width of the central barrier @xmath15 so that atoms localized in adjacent wells will not interact , and moreover we ensured that the energy of the states converged in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the well depth @xmath17 was tuned to generate a positive or negative scattering length @xmath18 $ ] , and was constrained to @xmath19 to confine at most one bound state .",
    "however , the inclusion of the bound state leads to many molecular states crossing the lowest energy open channel ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : directplot](a ) ) .",
    "this requires us to adiabatically track states between calculations performed at neighboring scattering lengths @xmath20 , @xmath21 , that can be uniquely followed by connecting states with the correct spin , inversion symmetry , angular momentum @xmath22 , and the greatest wave function overlap @xmath23 where @xmath24 are state indices .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     two trapped atoms with a positive scattering length always yields a @xmath25 ground state @xcite , so to realize the simplest possible ferromagnetic ground state we turn to a three - atom system . for a sufficiently strong central barrier this delivers a quantum simulator of the double exchange mechanism for ferromagnetism : two atoms are localized in the lowest level of each well , and a third itinerant atom in a higher energy level couples their spins . with three atoms",
    "there are two possibilities for the highest occupied orbital : either with a node longitudinally ( @xmath26 ) , or two degenerate modes with a transverse node ( @xmath27 ) . to study the emergence of magnetic correlations we use both exact diagonalization and perturbation theory .",
    "we adopt the same perturbation theory as introduced in the direct exchange section for a small central barrier and weak scattering , except now for the three - atom states shown in table  [ tab : wavefunctions ] . to orient the discussion we focus initially on the realization of itinerant ferromagnetism before introducing a central barrier to consider the double exchange mechanism .",
    "exact diagonalization delivers the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubleplot ] that compare well with the perturbation theory predictions . at @xmath28",
    "the system enters the @xmath29 state at @xmath30 , which compares favorably to the perturbation calculation estimate that @xmath31 and a prediction that we extrapolated from the data of liu of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we note that the exact theory has a lower critical interaction strength than the perturbation theory prediction , which reflects the situation of the itinerant case  @xcite .",
    "the critical interaction strength is predicted to be independent of trap ellipticity @xmath33 by both exact diagonalization and the perturbation theory calculations . in the high barrier",
    "potential limit we follow the example from the direct exchange calculation and model the system with the hubbard hamiltonian , predicting a crossover at @xmath34 .",
    "this is in direct agreement with the results from exact diagonalization .    when @xmath35 it is energetically favorable to occupy longitudinal modes and when @xmath36 the transverse modes are preferred",
    ". however , the introduction of a central barrier favors longitudinal states ( @xmath26 ) with a node across the barrier , with the crossover at @xmath37 for both @xmath38 ( at @xmath39 ) and @xmath29 .",
    "a weak central barrier forces the atoms apart reducing the effective interaction strength , meaning that the boundary between the @xmath38 and @xmath29 phases has a positive slope of @xmath40 . with a larger central barrier the longitudinal @xmath38 state and transverse @xmath29 state share a phase boundary with a negative slope giving rise to a characteristic notch .",
    "the phases are distinguished not only by their spin quantum number but also the degeneracy associated with the orientation of the node in the highest occupied orbital .",
    "the changing degeneracy means that the phases with the same spin quantum number can not evolve into one another so there is a quantum phase transition between the two . in a cold atom gas",
    "both total spin and symmetry are conserved , so to probe the phase diagram a tunneling measurement is proposed  @xcite , with the gas starting from four atoms , tilting the trap , and tunneling down to the three atom configuration with the lowest energy . at the critical interaction strength",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath29 states will be formed with equal likelihood , but taking account of the degeneracy will boost the formation of the doubly degenerate states , presenting an ideal tool to characterize the phases .",
    "the high barrier perturbation theory provided a perfect description for the phase behavior predicted by exact diagonalization theory in that limit .",
    "this demonstrates that the ferromagnetism is driven by double exchange , consistent with the observed exponential decay of the interaction matrix element between one atom localized in the left and another in the right - hand well .",
    "however , the high barrier perturbation theory is unable to describe the system with a low central barrier , where the requirement to have orbitals with a longitudinal node is incompatible with the node - less `` transverse '' wave functions found in exact diagonalization and shown in table  [ tab : wavefunctions ] , which are of itinerant nature .",
    "therefore , the crossover from `` transverse '' to `` longitudinal '' wavefunctions in the phase diagram denotes the underlying ferromagnetic correlations changing from itinerant to localized double exchange .",
    "the double well system is the perfect playground to study the exchange mechanisms of strongly interacting fermions .",
    "we have studied the direct exchange mechanism that is the fundamental building block of heisenberg antiferromagnetism , and exposes the competition between covalent and ionic bonding .",
    "the experimental flexibility of the cold atom gas also presents the ideal arena to study quantum entanglement . trapping three fermions",
    "delivers the first faithful realization of the double exchange mechanism .",
    "this can provide insights into heisenberg ferromagnets and @xmath0 superexchange , and be built up to larger lattices through a cluster expansion .",
    "the exchange mechanisms presented here give a tantalizing insight into the broad range of effects that can be explored in the double well potential .",
    "the inclusion of a third potential well would allow investigators to study the kramers - anderson superexchange mechanism  @xcite behind many antiferromagnets .",
