    "coherent dynamics and the interaction with a classical environment leading to decoherence are so far a highly unexplored area of the border between quantum and classical physics .",
    "shell - filling effects in quantum dots were demonstrated as oscillations in the addition energy spectra with increasing number of electrons in the dot almost ten years ago @xcite .",
    "a few years earlier the ground state energies as function of an external magnetic field were measured @xcite .",
    "these findings sparked off an intense activity on the applications of well - known quantum mechanical structure theories from atomic and nuclear physics to the new area of quantum dots .",

    "in structure theory it is well known that lcao combined with excact diagonalization rapidly becomes computationally impractical with increasing number of electrons .",
    "hf , dft and qmc theories are in general much more applicable with increasing particle size .",
    "the dft method method has successfully reproduced experimental addition energy spectra @xcite , while similar success of the hf method has not yet been reported .",
    "the hf method as well as mean field models do however give rise to oscillatory addition energy spectra @xcite as well .",
    "various qmc approaches have investigated the role of correlations , confinement geometry and shell effects for zero external magnetic field , see eg .",
    "the onset of a magnetic field introduces an additional parameter in the hamiltonian and thus an implicit dependence of the n - electron energy levels as function of the field .",
    "it is well known that with increasing ( weak ) field the various field free energy levels depend differently on the field which leads to an intricate spectrum of ( avoided ) level crossings .",
    "it was for example recently shown that the character of ground state of a two - electron double dot changes from a @xmath0 type to a @xmath1 and back to @xmath2 type as the field strength is increased @xcite .",
    "the behavior of many - particle systems in magnetic fields has previously been investigated for up to 13 electrons @xcite by qmc methods .    in this paper",
    "we apply a new qmc procedure @xcite to study the ground state properties of parabolically confined two - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "we calculate addition energy spectra for dots with 2 to 20 electrons and we display the behavior of the ground state for increasing magnetic field .",

    "these are based on the employment of non - equilibrium molecular dynamics methods where a thermostat slowly cools the system to a near - frozen state .    in the following section we briefly describe the theoretical models and the computational methods .",

    "the parameter @xmath12 is empirically introduced to mimic a finite confinement size in the @xmath13 direction .",

    "in addition the dot electrons may be exposed to a constant magnetic field , @xmath16 , in the @xmath13direction which correspond to an electromagnetic vector potential @xmath17 .",

    "we thus assume that the electrons in the quantum dot move in a two - dimensional parabolic potential , meaning in turn that the one - body problem is similar to the classical harmonic oscillator problem . in scaled units ,",

    "the two upper curves are the variational monte carlo energies obtained without and with the jastrow factor described in the previous section .",
    "this factor is seen to play an increasing role for increasing number of electrons , as expected since the average distance between the electrons decreases with increasing electrons in the dot . for @xmath61 electrons",
    "the jastrow factors decreases the energy with about 10% . to compare with the total role of the electron - electron interaction we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the corresponding ground state for non - interacting particles , full line with circles .",
    "the role of the correlations is again seen to increase with the number of electrons , but much less than for the interacting case .",
    "finally , in the same figure we display the ground state energy obtained with the classical molecular dynamics calculations .",
    "as expected the energies are a factor of two below the quantal interacting energies due to vanishing kinetic energy for @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig1b ] the role of screening is examined by computing the addition energy spectra with @xmath64 mev .",
    "the addition spectra is given by , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the chemical potential .",
    "the energies have been evaluated with @xmath67 and 10 nm .",
    "strong peaks at @xmath68 and @xmath69 and higher `` magic '' numbers are obtained in all cases , in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the strong peak for @xmath70 gets reduced for increasing @xmath12 and the calculations for @xmath71 nm are in better agreement with experiment than the @xmath72 case .",
    "one can argue for a finite @xmath12 value since a quantum dot has a finite thickness , resulting in a screened coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the total energy and makes the harmonic oscillator potential more dominant .",
    "we also notice that the addition energy is large at the half - filled shells @xmath73 . according to hund s rule , these are the states with maximum total spin , i.e. the electron eigenspins are parallel .",
    "such configurations require an antisymmetric spatial wave function , which minimises the coulomb repulsion between the electrons by keeping electrons apart and making the configuration more stable . by screeening the electrons we reduce the effect of the coulomb repulsion , therefore also making the spatial antisymmetrisation less important for lowering the energy of the configuration .",
    "therefore , the addition energy peaks at half - filled shells become smaller as we increase the screening parameter @xmath12 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    we now turn to the non - zero magnetic field configurations .",
    "the detailed lifting of the ground state energies with magnetic fields is of great importance for coherent transport in coupled double dots .",
    "the tunneling amplitude between dots depends exponentially on the barrier parameters and energy levels which again can be adiabatically tuned by a time dependent external field . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the total energy of a two- and one - particle ground state as a function of magnetic field strength is shown , in the two - electron case with and without the electron - electron interaction .",
    "as expected , with zero total orbital momentum , the energy increases monotonous with the magnetic field . the contribution from the coulomb repulsion",
    "is seen to be very significant already for two electrons as it accounts for around @xmath74 of the total energy .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the importance of the coulomb repulsion increases with increasing magnetic field and number of particles .",
    "introducing a finite offset @xmath12 puts a limit on how close the electrons may approach each other .",
    "this will of course prevent the coulomb interaction from growing with magnetic field when the offset @xmath12 is large enough . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the scaled total energy as a function of magnetic field strength for @xmath69 , @xmath75 and @xmath61 electrons .",
    "the comparison shows that the electron repulsion amplifies the increase of energies due to the increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "the increased energy is seen to be close to proportional with the number of particles .",
    "we now turn to a detailed comparison of the quantal ground state probability distribution in absence of a magnetic field with corresponding classical calculations . in fig .",
    "[ probabilities ] the classical electron configurations ( left ) with the single - electron probability density obtained after integration over the remaining @xmath76 electron s , @xmath77     for the classical results of fig .  [ probabilities ] , the black dots represent electron positions obtained from freezing an initial distribution to @xmath78 . by keeping @xmath79 , but small , we also produce a classical spatial density distribution by time averaged superpositions of a large number of instantaneous configurations as described in ref .",
    "these densities are represented by shades of gray superimposed over the static electron positions .",
    "the @xmath69 configuration is identical to the one obtained in ref .",
    "it contains a single electron in the middle and five electrons in an outer ring .",
    "this double structure is also seen for @xmath75 , but now with 3 electrons in the inner ring .",
    "the @xmath80 configuration not shown here but published in @xcite contains the first triple ring with one electron in the center , six electrons in the middle ring and 12 in the outer ring .",
    "it is interesting to note that when adding one extra electron , the @xmath61 configuration minimizes energy by placing the extra electron in the middle ring .",
    "comparison between classical and quantal probability density distributions shows as expected a clear discrepancy for @xmath68 since anti symmetrization results in a spatial symmetric wave function with a large probability of finding an electron in the trap center .",
    "for @xmath69 the quantal ground state is a single ring with no inner electron , again due to antisymmetry , while the classical @xmath69 configuration has a centrally positioned electron .",
    "this pattern remains valid also for the remaining two cases , viz .",
    ", where the classical calculations yield a centrally placed electron , the quantal calculations show a central density dip at the center , while the absence of central electron in the classical configuration ( @xmath68 and @xmath75 ) is matched by increased central density in the quantal case . in",
    "the quantal displays the gray shade coding has been selected to visualize the density variations which are of the order of about @xmath81 in the @xmath75 and @xmath61 cases .",
    "apart from this effect of the pauli principle the systematics of the main shells for @xmath82 , @xmath75 and @xmath61 compare well in spatial distribution with the corresponding classical ones , showing that the classical static configurations may roughly describe the ranges of the charge density distributions even for systems with relatively few confined electrons .",
    "the grayscale in quantum densities is such that it reflects the density variations which are increasingly smaller and smaller with the number of electrons in the inner region ( about 40 percent in the n=6 case , about 20 for n=20 and around 10 percent for the largest n - values .",
    "these variations reflect the nodal structure of the last filled oscillator shell .",
    "the top or dip in the central region follows the parity of the last filled shell which is negative for n=6,20 and positive for n=12,30 . for n=30",
    "there are 3 visible quantal and classical shells , the inner `` inversion '' is again obvious .",
    "half of the classical electrons occupy the outer shell somewhat smaller than the quantal probability density for the reason discussed above .",
    "we close by concluding that even if there are distinct quantum features exposed in the right panels , the shell structure and the sizes of the classical systems show a surprisingly good correspondence with the quantal structures .",
    "the present investigation has demonstrated the usefulness of the quantum monte carlo method for studies of relatively large numbers electrons inside a quantum dot with parameters typically achieved in experiments .",
    "studies of the effects of the magnetic field have shown that the energy per particle increase due to the magnetic field is amplified by the electron repulsion , roughly proportional to the number of electrons .",
    "his follows from comparisons with the non - interacting cases and can be traced to the fact that the repulsion leads to increased expectation values of the charge distribution radius and the fact that the energetic effects of the magnetic field depends on this quantity .",
    "the quantal calculations were compared with classical molecular dynamics calculations of the static equilibrium positions of classical charges confined by a harmonic force .",
    "the comparisons for closed shells shows that for the chosen type of quantum dots , the effect of the pauli principle leads to differing behavior of the classical configurations and the quantal distributions in the central area .",
    "the overall shell structure in the quantal and classical case nevertheless has a remarkable agreement in shape and spatial extension .",
    "this points further to the possibility that a range of important dynamical processes in quantum dots may be understood from purely classical models ."
