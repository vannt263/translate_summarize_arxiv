    "astronomical observations tell us that the universe has been expanding for almost 14 billion years so it must have emerged from a state with extremely high energy densities of matter fields .",
    "theoretical attempts of understanding the early stage of the universe are , however , plagued by the cosmological singularity characterized by blowing up of physical invariants .",
    "this concerns almost all known general relativity models of the universe ( friedmann , lematre , kasner , bianchi , szekeres ,  ) .",
    "the existence of the cosmological singularities in solutions to einstein s equations means that this classical theory is incomplete .",
    "expectation is that quantization may heal the singularities .    the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , which is homogenous and isotropic , is commonly used to describe the cosmological data .",
    "however , the isotropy is dynamically unstable in the backward evolution towards the cosmic singularity @xcite . the general anisotropic model including frw as a special case is the bianchi ix model .",
    "it is the best prototype for the belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) scenario , which is thought to be a generic solution to the einstein equations near the cosmological singularity @xcite .",

    "we look for symptoms of the chaotic behavior at the quantum level . for this purpose",
    ", the spectrum of canonically quantized hamiltonian for the vacuum bianchi ix model is analyzed . in our considerations ,",
    "the hard wall approximation ( which is well satisfied in vicinity of the cosmic singularity ) for the bianchi ix potential is applied .",
    "the bianchi ix model can be viewed as a generalization of the positively curved ( @xmath1 ) frw with two additional degrees of freedom parameterizing the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the line element of the model reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 are 1-forms satisfying @xmath4 .",

    "the @xmath9 is an average scale factor related to @xmath10 , playing a role of internal time .",
    "based on the @xmath11 functions , it is convenient to define parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the closed ( @xmath1 ) frw model is recovered for @xmath14 , with @xmath15 corresponding to the frw scale factor .",
    "the action integral for bianchi type models reads @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are canonical variables , @xmath19 , whereas @xmath20 is the physical ( true ) hamiltonian .",

    "the difficulty in solving this equation is due to complicated form of the potential , which would require application of sophisticated numerical techniques .",
    "however , near the singularity ( when @xmath34 ) , the potential @xmath35 can be approximated by the hard walls equilateral triangle potential @xcite . this can be deduced from the structure of the equipotential lines of @xmath24 ( see fig . [ figure1 ] ) as well as from the asymptotic form of the potential @xmath36 for @xmath37 . the effective triangle in which the motion takes place",
    "is found to be @xcite : @xmath38 .",
    "employing the hard wall approximation , the operator @xmath30 given by ( [ ap6 ] ) reduces to @xmath39 with the domain @xmath40 the hilbert space @xmath41 has the inner product @xmath42 .",
    "one can show that the operator ( [ htriangle ] ) defined on ( [ htriangdom ] ) is self - adjoint .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath43 are real and the corresponding eigenvectors form an orthogonal set . despite of non - separability , the eigenequation @xmath44 can be solved analytically , leading to the following set of eigenvalues @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the eigenvalues are labeled by @xmath47 and where @xmath48    in what follows we are interested in the spectrum of the operator @xmath49 rather than the @xmath43 .",

    "the level spacing distribution is often characterized by the distribution obtained for gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of the random matrices : @xmath54 in contrast , integrable systems are characterized roughly by the poisson distribution @xmath55    in real system , chaotic and regular regimes often coexist : the level spacing distribution can be modeled by distribution interpolating between poisson and goe distributions , such as the brody distribution @xmath56 where @xmath57^{\\beta+1}$ ] . at the limits of the interval",

    "we apply the procedure to the spectrum ( [ spectrumsquare ] ) . for this purpose",

    "the fit ( [ fit ] ) performed for @xmath67 is no more valid for the @xmath68 case .",
    "the level spacing distributions obtained with and without applying the unfolding procedure are qualitatively similar .",

    "the observed deficit of the small level spacing ( with respect to the poisson distribution ) indicates for level repulsion , which might reflect chaotic nature of bianchi ix model .",
