    "non - leptonic weak decays of b mesons are very interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , cp violation in the b - meson system will eventually give us information about the cp violating phase in the cabibbo -kobayashi -maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "second , non - leptonic weak decays will give additional clues for determining the absolute values of the quark mixing parameters , in particular the ratio @xmath0 , although it is expected that more solid information will come from semi - leptonic b decays .",
    "last , the dynamics of the non - leptonic weak decays in the framework of the standard model is only poorly understood .",
    "one of the problems in calculating the transition amplitudes for non - leptonic weak decays is that one needs to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of certain four - quark operators which can be done in qcd only with non - perturbative methods .",
    "the usual route to calculating these hadronic matrix elements is to start from the effective , qcd corrected , hamiltonian for the @xmath1 non - leptonic decays in the six - quark model , i.e. including the t quark @xcite .",
    "this gives the weak hamiltonian in terms of four - quark operators .",
    "for computing the hadronic matrix elements of these four - quark operators the factorization approximation is used @xcite . then the hadronic matrix elements are given in terms of current matrix elements ( matrix elements of two - quark operators ) as they appear also in semi - leptonic decays .",
    "these current matrix elements are much easier to calculate and many models @xcite have been proposed for them .",
    "when these current matrix elements are approximated by a single pole based on the idea of vector dominance we arrive at the pole - dominance model of two - body non - leptonic decays .",
    "this model has been applied to the calculation of non - leptonic decays of charmed mesons @xcite .",
    "many years ago , this model was used already for the discussion of strange particle decays . in particular , it is known , that this model provides a basis for a description of @xmath2 decays @xcite .    in this work",
    "we apply the pole - dominance model to two - body non - leptonic b decays and show its strong relationship to the usual factorization model @xcite .",
    "therefore this latter model will be our starting point where we also use as input the parameters of the current matrix elements as given in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to extract various strong coupling constants between b mesons , their vector and axial - vector counterparts , and light and charmed mesons .",
    "these coupling constants and also the form factors of the current matrix elements will be compared with other information coming from qcd sum rule and qcd lattice calculations . for simplicity , we consider only the lowest lying poles .",
    "the inclusions of higher lying poles would make the extraction of the strong coupling constants impossible .",
    "the outline is as follows : in section 2 , we explain the relationship of the usual approach with the pole - dominance model using as example a collection of b decays into two pseudoscalar - mesons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we calculate the two - body branching ratios in parallel for the usual approach and two versions of the pole - dominance framework . in one version",
    "we calculate the residues of the poles on the mass shell of the intermediate state .",
    "this reproduces the usual approach .",
    "the other version follows essentially the work of bedaque et al.@xcite for d decays where a particular off - shell extrapolation has been adopted .",
    "these results are compared to experimental data when they are available . in section 3 ,",
    "we proceed to the more complicated @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels , where v are light or charmed vector mesons .",
    "section 4 is reserved for a summary and some conclusions .",
    "to start , we choose as an example for the decays @xmath3 , the channel @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant effective weak hamiltonian can be parameterized as @xmath7 + h.c . , \\ ] ] where the @xmath8 ( i=1,2 ) are the short - distance wilson coefficients defined at a scale @xmath9 of the order of the heavy quark mass @xmath10 and the @xmath11 are the local quark operators with the appropriate quantum numbers . for simplicity we have neglected the strong and electroweak penguins .",
    "the electroweak penguins are found to give small contributions to the mode @xmath6 .",
    "the strong penguins could be included easily @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions of the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 are : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are colour indices and @xmath16 . for",
    "the wilson coefficients at the scale @xmath17gev we use the values @xcite : @xmath18    these coefficients are regularization scheme independent at next - to - leading logarithmic precision as obtained by buras et al.@xcite for @xmath19mev . with the factorization hypothesis and after fierz reordering we obtain from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath20 where n is the number of colours .    the current matrix elements in ( [ 4 ] )",
    "are evaluated in terms of form factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the decay @xmath23 and the pion decay constant @xmath24gev as follows : @xmath25   f_1^{b\\to \\pi } ( q^2 )   + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m_b^2-m_\\pi^2}{q^2}q_\\mu f_0^{b\\to \\pi } ( q^2)\\ ] ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 . with these definitions",
    "we get the following result for ( [ 4 ] ) : @xmath28    in ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath29 are the form factors of @xmath30 ( transverse ( longitudinal ) ) projections of the vector current . at @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 to cancel the pole at @xmath31 in ( [ 5 ] ) . but @xmath21 and @xmath22 differ for arbitrary @xmath33 . in ( [ 7 ] )",
    "we need @xmath34 only for @xmath35 , which is small , so that we can set @xmath36 . of course for @xmath37 with arbitrary @xmath33 in ( [ 5 ] ) we obtain the same result .",
    "the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) part of the current ( @xmath40 ) has the quantum number of the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) meson with mass @xmath43gev ( @xmath44gev ) ( we denote the @xmath45 bound states by @xmath46 ) .",
    "if according to the vector - meson - dominance model ( vdm ) the form factor @xmath47 is dominated by just this @xmath38 resonance with mass @xmath48 we have @xmath49 in ( [ 8 ] ) the current coupling @xmath50 is defined by the vector current matrix element @xmath51 and the strong coupling is defined through the lagrangian @xmath52 similarly we define the current matrix element of the scalar resonance state @xmath42 : @xmath53 and the coupling of @xmath42 to @xmath54 by @xmath55 @xmath56 is dimensionless . with these definitions the form factor @xmath57",
    "is given in the scalar - meson - dominance model by the formula @xmath58 with ( [ 13 ] ) the weak transition matrix element ( [ 7 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are on - shell couplings to the scalar resonance @xmath62 which is on the mass shell .",
    "this means that the off - shell extrapolation factor of the current matrix element is given by just a single pole in ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "[ ff2 ]    the result ( [ 14 ] ) for the transition amplitude @xmath63 can be obtained more directly from the pole diagram in fig.1a . in this diagram",
    ", the initial @xmath64 can go into a @xmath65 or @xmath66 via the strong interaction couplings ( [ 10 ] ) or ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath41 or @xmath67 converts into a @xmath68 via the weak interaction ( [ 1 ] ) shown in terms of quark lines in fig.1b .",
    "the weak matrix element is evaluated in the vacuum insertion approximation with the following result for the intermediate @xmath42 : @xmath69 in ( [ 14p ] ) @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the current matrix elements in ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) have been used .",
    "inserting the propagator of the intermediate @xmath72 meson and the strong vertex the result for the decay matrix element is : @xmath73 the result ( [ 15 ] ) agrees with ( [ 14 ] ) as to be expected . to achieve this ,",
    "two ingredients were essential .",
    "first , the coupling @xmath74 in ( [ 12 ] ) has such a form that it vanishes for @xmath75 , i.e. the coupling of a scalar meson to two pseudoscalar mesons of equal masses would be different .",
    "second , in ( [ 14p ] ) we have set @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the weak transition matrix element @xmath77 is evaluated at the on - shell point of the intermediate @xmath42 resonance , whereas the propagator is calculated at @xmath78 .",
    "this is in the spirit of the meson - dominance approximation and agrees with the result ( [ 13 ] ) where the form factor @xmath57 is written down directly in this approximation .    in the pole model calculations of ref.@xcite",
    "a different route has been taken . instead of the @xmath62 state",
    "the intermediate state is the @xmath79 with spin @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the pole cancels by the factor @xmath80 in the numerator and the result is @xmath81 the difference between ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) is small since @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear however , that in this evaluation the residue of the pole @xmath83 vanishes like @xmath84 , so that the pole is canceled . this is apparent also from ( [ 14p ] ) when we evaluate @xmath85 in the vacuum saturation approximation .",
    "then we obtain the factor @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the polarization vector of the @xmath79 .",
    "of course , this factor vanishes on the mass shell .",
    "we think that our evaluation of the pole model is more appropriate since the pole is kept , so that our result is correct for @xmath88 . since a large extrapolation from @xmath89 to @xmath35",
    "is involved , one must be careful in the calculation of the numerator .    from ( [ 13 ] )",
    "we have @xmath90 and a similar equation for @xmath91 following from ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "@xmath92 has been calculated in various approaches : quark model , qcd sum rule and qcd lattice calculations .",
    "thus either from these results or in case the branching ratio for the decay @xmath93 becomes precisely known experimentally the relation ( [ 15 ] ) allows us to calculate the coupling constant @xmath56 , if @xmath61 is determined from other sources .",
    "similarly @xmath91 is calculated from @xmath94 , where we need in addition the current coupling @xmath50 .",
    "since the experimental branching ratio of @xmath93 is not very well known yet ( see table  5 ) we must rely on @xmath92 as calculated in various models .",
    "we shall do this later and compare to direct theoretical results for @xmath56 or @xmath91 .",
    "our result for the weak transition matrix elements has the factor @xmath95 , which should be evaluated with n=3 . in the following",
    "we shall evaluate them with n=2 giving @xmath96 using ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath97 depends on n only mildly , since @xmath98 , so that choosing n=3 would give similar results for all colour unsuppressed decays , for which the transition matrix elements are proportional to @xmath97 . in the following",
    "we shall denote this class of decays by class i. the class ii stands for the colour suppressed decays which have matrix elements proportional to @xmath99 , which depends strongly on n. the third class is a superposition of class i and class ii matrix elements .",
    "recent comparisons of experimental data for many two - body b decays show that on the basis of the factorization hypothesis and bsw matrix elements from @xcite a reasonable fit to these data gives @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "n=3 would produce very bad results for the measured class ii decays and the class iii decays can be fitted only with a positive @xmath101 .",
    "for example , for n=2 , 3 or @xmath102 we have the following values for @xmath101 using ( [ 3 ] ) : @xmath103 .",
    "the choice @xmath104 is favored in d decays @xcite .",
    "the fact , that the choice n=3 is not possible points into the direction that so - called non - factorization contributions are significant , in particular in the class ii and class iii transitions . of course , it is not certain , that these contributions can universally accounted for by choosing n=2 .",
    "it is more likely that these contributions depend on the particular decay channel . for fits and constraints on the non - factorization terms in various channels",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that the result @xmath100 from the fit in @xcite depends on the bsw @xcite choice of transition form factors and current coupling constants .",
    "we shall assume @xmath105 independent in which pole model the weak matrix elements are evaluated .",
    "this can be justified empirically since the magnitude and also the sign of @xmath101 is deduced from such final states , where the two pole models coincide , as will be seen later in our presentation for the pv and vv results .",
    "if one gives up the requirement that the @xmath8 should be independent of the regularization scheme one can find short distance coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 in next - to - leading logarithmic precision which give @xmath108 with n=3 by selecting the appropriate scheme @xcite .",
    "other class i decays going into two pseudoscalar mesons are @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "these decays are calculated from @xmath115 s where @xmath116 and/or @xmath117 with the same short distance coefficients as in ( 3 ) .",
    "of special interest is the decay @xmath118 which belongs also to the colour unsuppressed class i. this decay can proceed also through the annihilation diagram .",
    "the diagrams in the usual factorization approximation for the quark diagram and for the pole model are shown in fig.[f3]a and [ f3]b .",
    "[ f3 ]    in the pole model according to ref.@xcite , the transition matrix element corresponding to the diagram in fig.[f3]b is @xmath119 with ( [ 8 ] ) this can be written as @xmath120 compared to the dominant pole contribution , which is given by the analogous equation to ( [ 14 ] ) , the annihilation contribution is suppressed by the factor @xmath121 which is approximately 0.03 .",
    "the fact that in ( [ 17p ] ) the pole @xmath122 has canceled against the same factor @xmath123 in the numerator indicates that the residue of the pole vanishes on the mass shell of the @xmath124 resonance .",
    "this is already obvious when one evaluates the weak transition matrix element in the vacuum saturation approximation @xmath125 the first current matrix element in ( [ 18p ] ) is proportional to the polarization vector of the @xmath124 whereas the second current matrix element is proportional to @xmath126 , so that the product vanishes .",
    "this indicates , that the pole - model calculation of the annihilation contribution is also ambiguous .    if we start from the quark diagram in fig.[f3]a and do the vacuum insertion approximation , but then evaluate the matrix element @xmath127 we obtain the usual result : @xmath128 this means that the annihilation contribution is suppressed further by the additional factor @xmath129 , which results from the fact that in ( [ 18 ] ) the current transition form factor is highly off - shell at @xmath130 , whereas the off - shell extrapolation in the pole diagram is determined by the mass of the @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear that the pole - model calculation starting from fig.[f3]a with a @xmath39 intermediate state leads to the same result ( [ 18 ] ) .",

    "but it vanishes since the particles in the final state have equal masses .",
    "we conclude that the pole - model calculation of the non - annihilation diagrams as depicted in fig.1a agrees with the usual calculations of the @xmath140 decays where the form factors are approximated by a single pole ( compare ( [ 14 ] ) with ( [ 15 ] ) ) .",
    "if a different off - shell extrapolation as advocated in ref.@xcite is assumed we obtain the result ( [ 16 ] ) which differs actually very little from ( [ 15 ] ) since @xmath141 and the extrapolation of @xmath57 from @xmath142 to @xmath35 has only a small effect .",
    "of course , this is different for decays like @xmath143 , for which the form factor @xmath144 must be computed for @xmath145 , which differs from @xmath146 to be inserted into ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "class ii decays are @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "the decays @xmath150 and @xmath151 are class iii decays , where contributions of colour suppressed and unsuppressed matrix elements interfere .    to obtain an overview on expected branching ratios for all these decays we shall present results in two schemes : ( i ) the pole - model calculation in the form ( [ 14 ] ) which is equal to the usual quark diagram computation in terms of form factors @xmath152 ; ( ii ) the pole model result ( [ 16 ] ) where the pole canceled and the result depends on @xmath153 . in scheme ( i ) the annihilation contribution which occurs in some channels is negligible , either due to strong suppression in the quark diagram result ( [ 18 ] ) or due to the same suppression for the pole model . in scheme ( ii ) we evaluate the annihilation diagram with the formula ( [ 17p ] ) which involves a different off - shell extrapolation of the residue of the pole .",

    "<S> non - leptonic decays of b mesons into two mesons or meson resonances are studied on the basis of two versions of simple pole - dominance models involving scalar , vector , pseudoscalar and axial - vector poles . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with those obtained from the usual factorization model and used to obtain information on strong coupling constants between b meson and one light or one charmed meson , respectively . </S>",
