    "the large - scale structure of the universe represents one of the most powerful discriminants between cosmological models .",
    "qsos are highly effective probes of the structure of the universe over a wide range of scales and can trace clustering evolution over a look - back time which is 70 - 80 per cent of its present age . in the linear regime ( @xmath14h@xmath15mpc )",
    ", they are clearly superior to galaxies as probes of large scale structure by virtue of both the large volumes they sample and their flat @xmath16 distribution . accurately measuring the clustering over these scales bridges the gap between the clustering results on relatively small scales from galaxy redshift surveys out to scales previously only probed by microwave background anisotropy experiments .",
    "the power spectrum perhaps provides the most natural description of the matter fluctuations that comprise large - scale structure ; for a gaussian field , the amplitude of the fourier modes provide a statistically complete description of the density perturbations .",
    "one potential problem of using qsos as probes of large scale structure is that they , like galaxies , are biased tracers of the mass density field .",
    "qso imaging experiments at redshifts out to @xmath17 suggest that the qsos reside in relatively modest ( @xmath18 ) galaxy hosts ( rix et al .",
    "2001 ; ridgway et al .",
    "2001 ) and that the clustering environment of uvx qsos are similar to optically selected galaxies ( croom & shanks 1999 ) .",
    "this implies that at @xmath19 qsos and galaxies have a similar bias with respect to the underlying mass density field ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2002 ) .",
    "it is likely that the bias is scale - dependent , at least at small scales ( blanton et al .",
    "1999 ) . at larger scales ( @xmath20h@xmath15mpc ) , however , where qso clustering statistics prevail , the shape ( although not the amplitude ) of the measured power spectrum can reasonably be assumed to apply to the mass and galaxies as well , since it is unlikely that the qso bias will be scale dependent in this regime ( coles 1993 ; mann , peacock & heavens 1998 ) . for the purposes of modelling the qso p(k ) in this paper we assume that any bias is scale independent on the scales considered ( @xmath21h@xmath15mpc ) .    with the principal aim of determining the form of qso clustering , and hence producing strong new constraints on cosmological models ,",
    "we have used the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope to make a large qso redshift survey .",
    "the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) comprises two @xmath22 declination strips , one at the south galactic pole and one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap .",
    "qsos are selected by ultra - violet excess ( uvx ) in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "the effectiveness of our qso selection criteria has been demonstrated with an overall qso sky density of @xmath24 to @xmath25 being achieved , at a completeness of 93 per cent .",
    "spectroscopic observations are now complete , and we have been able to identify 86 per cent of the colour - selected candidates . around half ,",
    "47 per cent , of the 47768 candidates are positively identified as qsos , leading to a final catalogue containing 22652 qsos .",
    "the qsos typically have redshifts @xmath26 , and probe a volume of around @xmath27mpc@xmath28 ( assuming an einstein - de sitter cosmology ) .",
    "the spectra of the first 10000 2qz qsos were released in april 2001 ( croom et al 2001a ) and can be obtained at http://www.2dfquasar.org .",
    "hoyle et al . ( 2002 ) used these qsos to measure the qso power spectrum .",
    "they found that the qso power spectrum has similar amplitude to that of local galaxies , and little evolution is seen with redshift .",
    "the main conclusion was that they detected large - scale power significantly in excess of the standard ( @xmath8 ) cdm prediction , strongly ruling out this model and more consistent with cdm models with lower mass content and a non - zero cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm ) .    in this paper , we re -",
    "apply the power spectrum analysis described in hoyle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to the final 2qz catalogue containing 22652 qsos . as well as having more than twice as many qsos as available to hoyle et al .",
    ", this dataset has a much cleaner window function , significantly reducing the potential systematics on large scales .",
    "we briefly describe the 2qz data set in section [ sec : qsodata ] , including the angular and radial selection functions which are required to estimate the survey window function .",
    "section  [ pkest ] discusses the power spectrum estimation method , and the resulting qso power spectrum is presented in section  [ sec : qsoreslts ] . in this section",
    "we compare the qso power spectrum to that of present day galaxies and clusters , and investigate evolution in the clustering amplitude .",
    "then , in section [ sec : qsoimp ] , we compare the qso power spectrum with models of large scale structure , deriving strong constraints on the baryon and matter content of the universe , before drawing conclusions in section [ sec : qsoconc ] .",
    "the 2qz comprises two @xmath22 declination strips , one at the south galactic pole ( centred at @xmath29 , with 21@xmath3040@xmath31 @xmath32 03@xmath3015@xmath31 ) and one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap ( centred at @xmath33 with 09@xmath3050@xmath31 @xmath32 14@xmath3050@xmath31 ) .",
    "we will refer to these regions as the sgc and ngc respectively .",
    "qsos are selected to @xmath25 by ultra - violet excess ( uvx ) in the @xmath23 plane , at a completeness of 93 per cent .",
    "the spectra of the objects are obtained using the 2df instrument on the aat and reduced using the 2df pipeline reduction system ( bailey & glazebrook 1999 ) .",
    "objects are identified as qsos by an automated procedure known as autoz ( miller et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "autoz also determines the qso redshifts ; these have then been visually checked by two independent observers .",
    "the final 2qz catalogue , containing 22652 qsos ( only those qsos with quality 1 are used in this analysis ; see croom et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for details ) , covers an area of 740 deg@xmath34 , and the data will be released to the community in the first half of 2003 .      in order to estimate the qso power spectrum , we need to take into account the various selection effects introduced when constructing the survey .",
    "this is achieved by generating a catalogue of random points that mimics the angular and radial selection functions of the qsos but otherwise is unclustered .",
    "the rapid luminosity evolution seen in qsos ( boyle et al . 2000 ) means that at each redshift , over the redshift range we are considering , we are studying roughly the same part of the qso luminosity function , relative to @xmath35 . in areas where the spectroscopic completeness is low , due for example to poor seeing conditions ,",
    "we are sampling on average slightly brighter qsos .",
    "this just has the effect of sampling qsos further up the luminosity function at all redshifts , rather than sampling objects at lower redshift , as is typical with galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "even if we cut back the magnitude limit of the survey by half a magnitude from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the mean redshift only drops slightly from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , for this work we have assumed that the radial and angular selection functions can be applied independently , and consider each in turn below .",
    "the qsos were observed simultaneously with galaxies from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , and an adaptive tiling algorithm was developed to allow as many galaxies and qsos as possible to be observed in each pointing .",
    "the pointings overlap in high density regions to maximise the coverage in all areas of the survey , and with this algorithm , we have achieved a completeness of 93 per cent .",
    "in addition to the 7 per cent of objects on which we were unable to place fibres , regions around bright stars were omitted from the input catalogue , and hence the angular mask of the 2qz is quite complicated .",
    "the survey also suffers from spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "we have failed to confirm the identity of approximately 14 per cent of the objects observed .",
    "the spectra of these objects are typically very noisy , with a lack of discernible spectral features .",
    "as some classes of objects are easier to identify in low s / n spectra than others , due to , for example , distinctive emission lines , the spectroscopic completeness of qsos in the survey may differ from that of stars , or the input catalogue as a whole . to correct for spectroscopic incompleteness",
    "we therefore need to estimate the fraction of qsos that remain in these unidentified spectra . by examining the results from objects that have been observed more than once ,",
    "such an estimate can be obtained . for objects unidentified after their first observation , but identified in subsequent observations ,",
    "the relative fractions of qsos and stars are remarkably similar to those of the identified objects in the full survey .",
    "hence we estimate that qsos account for approximately the same proportion ( @xmath40 per cent ) of the identified and unidentified populations and so the spectroscopic incompleteness of qsos is in fact the same as that of the input catalogue as a whole .",
    "however , the rate of identifications obtained through the re - observation of previously unidentified objects is significantly lower than the survey average , and hence it is still possible that the fraction of qsos remaining in the unidentified population could be somewhat lower . through consideration of the fraction of qsos unidentified after their first observation that are subsequently identified",
    ", we can set a lower limit to the fraction of qsos in the remaining unidentified population at about 40 per cent .",
    "we will consider the effect of different spectroscopic completeness corrections in section  [ pksys ] .    to match the angular selection function of the qsos",
    ", we construct a completeness map , estimating completeness both to observational and spectroscopic effects in regions defined by the intersection of 2df pointings . in each such region",
    "we calculate the fraction of objects contained in the input catalogue that have been identified . as",
    "the spectroscopic incompleteness of qsos is approximately the same as that of the full input catalogue , the proportion of qsos in unobserved objects should be the same as the proportion of qsos in observed , but unidentified objects .",
    "hence we can take this fraction to be the overall ( observational and spectroscopic ) completeness in that region .",
    "as we are applying a spectroscopic completeness correction , we have decided not to apply simultaneously a minimum spectroscopic completeness cut , as this would reduce the size of our sample .",
    "we also account for the extinction due to galactic dust , using the estimate of the dust reddening , @xmath41 , as a function of position given by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) . as galactic dust",
    "changes the effective magnitude limit , we weight the random distribution by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the slope of the integral qso number - magnitude relation at the magnitude limit of the survey , @xmath45=20.85 . as we apply a dust correction to the angular mask , we need to correct for dust extinction in the observed radial selection function ( below ) to avoid including the effect of dust twice .",
    "we are measuring qso clustering as a function of comoving distance , and so we need to adopt a cosmology to convert from redshift into comoving distance . in this paper",
    "we consider an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath46=1.0 , @xmath47=0.0 ) cosmology @xmath5 ( eds hereafter ) and an @xmath48=0.3 , @xmath47=0.7 cosmology @xmath5 ( @xmath4 hereafter ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nr ] shows the radial selection function of qsos in the ngc ( solid line ) and sgc ( dashed line ) , corrected for the average dust extinction in each region and calculated assuming the eds @xmath5 or the @xmath4 @xmath5 . due to the contribution from the host galaxy , qsos at low redshift are lost from our input catalogue because they do not appear stellar .",
    "the host galaxy also reddens faint qsos causing then to be preferentially lost from the sample . to limit this incompleteness , we restrict our analysis to @xmath49 ( @xmath50mpc , assuming eds , or @xmath51mpc , assuming @xmath4 ) . at high redshifts",
    "the uvx colour selection technique breaks down as the lyman - alpha forest enters the @xmath52 band , and the completeness of the survey rapidly drops .",
    "therefore , we also limit our analysis to @xmath53 ( @xmath54mpc , assuming eds , or @xmath55mpc , assuming @xmath4 ) . over the redshift range @xmath56 the completeness of the 2qz colour selection technique",
    "is @xmath57 per cent .",
    "the sgc has a slightly higher normalisation ( 15 per cent ) than the ngc , even after correcting for the higher levels of dust in the ngc , but very similar shape , except at low redshift ( @xmath58mpc , or @xmath59 ) where the sgc suffers from higher incompleteness , probably due to star / galaxy separation differences .",
    "for this reason we treat the radial selection function separately in the two strips .",
    "the qso number density varies very slowly as a function of redshift .",
    "assuming eds it is almost constant over the range @xmath56 , whereas assuming @xmath4 , it decreases only by a factor of approximately three over the range @xmath56 . applying these redshift cuts therefore allows us to consider clustering statistics without the need for a weighting scheme .",
    "this gives us a sample of 8704 qsos in the ngc , and 10845 qsos in the sgc .",
    "we estimate the space density of qsos as a function of comoving distance , @xmath60 , via a 10 coefficient ( 9th order ) polynomial fit to the number distribution of qsos , @xmath61 , in each strip in bins of @xmath62mpc .",
    "further details of the fits , including the coefficients , are given in table  [ tablefit ] .",
    "the resulting @xmath60 distributions , used to create the random catalogue , are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : nr ] over the redshift range @xmath56 .",
    "a low order polynomial would provide a poor fit to the @xmath60 distribution . as the order",
    "is increased , the quality of the fit , as measured by the @xmath63 statistic , improves dramatically until approximately an 8/9 coefficient polynomial is used . further increasing the order of the fit",
    ", however , hardly reduces the @xmath63 value .",
    "if a much higher order polynomial were used , it may also start to fit real features in the @xmath60 distribution , and hence artificially remove power .",
    "hence a 10 coefficient polynomial is chosen so as to provide an adequate fit to the @xmath60 distribution without over - fitting .",
    ".the radial selection function is fitted separately in ngc and sgc , assuming either the eds @xmath5 or the @xmath4 @xmath5 to derive comoving distances from the qso redshifts .",
    "this table shows the values of the 10 coefficients obtained from a 9th order polynomial fit , @xmath64 , to the number of qsos in each strip , in the range @xmath65mpc ( @xmath4 ) , or @xmath66mpc ( eds ) , in bins of @xmath67mpc . the qso number density , @xmath60 ,",

    "the _ hubble volume _ simulation was introduced in section  [ hubvol ] .",
    "the power spectrum determined from biased mock qso catalogues , created using the final 2qz selection function imprinted on the _ hubble volume _ simulation , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pkhv ] , where it is compared to the real space input mass power spectrum for the simulation , together with the 2qz power spectrum with @xmath4 assumed .",
    "the simulation was designed to mimic the 2qz as closely as possible , and so any differences in shape should give a good test of the cosmological assumptions .",
    "the first thing to note is that over a wide range of scales , the output redshift - space mock catalogue power spectrum follows very closely the real space input mass power spectrum for the simulation . on the largest scales ( @xmath71 )",
    ", this demonstrates that the effects of the 2qz window , which were also imprinted on the _ hubble volume _ simulation , are relatively small , as shown in section  [ wfsec ] .",
    "this also shows that at scales of @xmath72 the biasing prescription we chose to create the mock catalogues ( see hoyle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for details ) has no effect on the shape of the power spectrum . on smaller scales , however , we see a slight reduction in the output power from the simulation , relative to the real space input power spectrum . this can be attributed to redshift - space distortions caused by small - scale peculiar velocities of the mock qsos .    a comparison between the _ hubble volume _ and 2qz power spectra shows that the simulation provides a very good fit to the observed data over virtually the whole range observed .",
    "the 2qz power spectrum is therefore entirely consistent with the @xmath4cdm cosmological model assumed to create the _",
    "hubble volume_. whilst performing detailed analyses of n - body simulations such as the _ hubble volume _ is very useful , providing a good test of the power spectrum estimator and a way of examining possible systematic effects , it is also very time consuming . we need to compare many different cdm models to derive constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore in the next section we instead compare the qso power spectrum to model cdm power spectra with a variety of different cosmologies .      assuming that qso bias is not scale - dependent on the scales we are probing",
    ", the shape of the qso power spectrum provides new constraints on the matter and baryonic contents of the universe at a different ( much higher ) redshift than that of the 2dfgrs , or other galaxy / cluster power spectrum determinations .",
    "therefore , the qso power spectrum measurement at @xmath1 can provide a powerful new test for cosmological models that have previously only been constrained locally ( @xmath3 ) and at recombination ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "model power spectra with a variety of cdm cosmologies have been created using transfer function formulae from eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) to compare with the 2qz data .",
    "we have chosen to vary @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 ) , and @xmath11 , considering the range @xmath76 and @xmath77 in order to determine constraints on these important parameters .",
    "we have assumed a scale invariant spectrum of initial fluctuations .",
    "the models generated have been numerically convolved with the 2qz window function .",
    "we noted in the comparison with the _ hubble volume _ simulation that small - scale power is slightly suppressed in the redshift - space power spectrum by small - scale peculiar velocities of the qsos . a second similar effect",
    "also affects the 2qz sample .",
    "there is an uncertainty in determining qso redshifts from the low resolution , low s / n 2df spectra of @xmath78 ( croom et al .",
    "2001a ) , which , at the average redshift of the survey , assuming @xmath4 , corresponds to an uncertainty in the line - of - sight distance of @xmath79mpc .",
    "this introduces an apparent velocity dispersion of @xmath80km@xmath81s@xmath15 , which can be added in quadrature to the true qso small - scale velocity dispersion .",
    "we can apply a simple model to correct the power spectrum for these redshift - space distortions ( ballinger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "following outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we assume an apparent qso line of sight pairwise velocity dispersion , due to both redshift determination errors and peculiar velocities , of @xmath82km@xmath81s@xmath15 , and a value of @xmath83 to describe the coherent peculiar velocities on large , linear scales due to the infall of galaxies into overdense regions . we do not attempt a correction for geometric distortions introduced by incorrect cosmological model assumptions when measuring the power spectrum .    for this analysis , we have assumed that the data points are independent .",
    "due to the compactness of our window function , this should be a good approximation .",
    "we have also had to assume a cosmology to derive the qso @xmath5 prior to measuring the qso power spectrum .",
    "ideally one would like to fit each power spectrum model to the power spectrum measured assuming the appropriate cosmology .",
    "however , this would be very time consuming , and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore we limit our analysis to power spectra measured assuming either an eds or @xmath4 @xmath5 . despite assuming a particular cosmology to derive the @xmath5",

    "as the shape of the power spectrum is primarily dependent on @xmath11 , and relatively invariant to changes in @xmath12 for a given @xmath11 , the value of @xmath12 has relatively little effect on the results . repeating the fit , with @xmath12 fixed at @xmath88 , following , for example , the results of tanvir et al .",
