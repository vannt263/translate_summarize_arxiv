    "nonperturbative strong dynamics is typified by the mass scale @xmath4 .",
    "interactions involving a very heavy quark of mass @xmath5 can be studied systematically by expanding in @xmath6 . upon truncation of the expansion at some order ,",
    "the resulting effective theory is not renormalizable and requires a momentum cutoff .",
    "if the required regularization is performed via a space - time lattice , then the cutoff is proportional to the inverse lattice spacing @xmath7 .",
    "a useful effective theory must satisfy @xmath8 so the cutoff is large enough to include the bulk of the nonperturbative dynamics in the low - energy effective theory , but small enough that the truncation of the expansion remains sensible .",
    "is the charm quark heavy enough for a useful lattice effective theory ?",
    "the present work addresses this question through a study of the masses of s - waves charmed mesons using quenched lattice nrqcd.@xcite calculations are performed at two lattice spacings near 0.22 fm and 0.26 fm , and in each case results are given separately at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the effective theory .",
    "this work is an extension of results that have been reported previously@xcite , and further details can be found in that paper .",
    "other authors have considered nrqcd up to @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the lattice action has three terms : gauge action , light quark action and heavy quark action .",
    "the entire action is classically and tadpole - improved with the tadpole factor defined by @xmath9 the gauge action includes a sum over 1@xmath102 rectangular plaquettes as well as 1@xmath101 elementary plaquettes . for light fermions ,",
    "the sheikholeslami - wohlert action@xcite is used with the clover coefficient set to its tadpole - improved value .",
    "the heavy quark action is nrqcd .",
    "a discretization of the nrqcd action leads to the following green s function propagation@xcite : @xmath11 where `` @xmath12 '' should be chosen to stabilize the numerics , and the hamiltonian is @xmath13 a tilde denotes removal of the leading discretization errors .",
    "classically , the coefficients @xmath14 are all unity , and their nonclassical corrections will not be discussed in this work .    it should be noted that the separation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) is not unique .",
    "the heavy quark propagation of eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) uses a simple linear approximation to the true exponential dependence on @xmath16 , while using a better - than - linear approximation for @xmath15 .",
    "the present work will report on a generalization of this choice .",
    "all data presented here correspond to a charmed meson with a light quark mass that is roughly twice the strange quark mass .",
    "more extensive results , including bottom mesons , can be found in ref .",
    "the data sample includes 400(300 ) gauge field configurations at @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18fm(0.22fm ) .",
    "all plots include bootstrap errors from 1000 ensembles .",
    "[ eord3 ] shows the simulation energy ( as read from the plateau of an effective mass plot ) of the @xmath19 meson .",
    "notice that at both lattice spacings the @xmath3 contribution is twice as large as the @xmath2 contribution , and that this large effect is dominated by the term containing @xmath20 in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "this term is unique because it is the only term up to @xmath3 which contains a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "the vacuum value can be calculated from our gauge field configurations , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ eord3 ] the simulation energy displays a very pleasing @xmath0 expansion after removal of the vacuum value .    the mass difference between @xmath21 and @xmath19 mesons",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ hypord3 ] .",
    "when the vacuum expectation value is not removed from the hamiltonian , the @xmath3 contribution is twice as large as the @xmath2 contribution in magnitude , due to large effects from the terms containing @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "[ hypord3 ] indicates that the @xmath20 effect is entirely due to the vacuum expectation value .",
    "this very substantial dependence of the spin splitting on the vacuum value should be disturbing , since the @xmath20 term is spin - independent .",
    "apparently the vacuum value is so large that it destabilizes heavy quark propagation and thereby introduces a spurious effect unless the vacuum value is removed from the hamiltonian . to support this claim ,",
    "we have redone the calculation after subtracting the @xmath20 term from @xmath16 and adding it to @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) . when this is done , the triangles of fig .",
    "[ hypord3 ] are reproduced regardless of whether the vacuum value is subtracted from the hamiltonian .",
    "this is the physically - expected result .    still , fig .",
    "[ hypord3 ] contains a large @xmath3 contribution dominated by the term containing @xmath22 .",
    "although this term does not contain a nonzero vacuum expectation value , one wonders if the heavy quark propagation might be unstable for this term as well , unless a better - than - linear approximation is used for the @xmath22 term in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "[ newfig ] shows the effect of subtracting all of @xmath16 from its present location in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) and putting the full hamiltonian in place of @xmath15 .",
    "that is , @xmath23 and we choose @xmath24 . to maintain classical improvement",
    ", the following @xmath3 term must be added to the hamiltonian : @xmath25 simulations with @xmath26 and @xmath27 are indistinguishable . at both lattice spacings ,",
    "the large @xmath22 effect is found to be robust , and the contribution from @xmath28 tends to increase .",
    "no discussion of the spin - independent terms containing @xmath29 and @xmath30 is presented here .",
    "instabilities can arise in the nrqcd expansion for charmed mesons due to the presence of a large vacuum expectation value .",
    "a better - than - linear approximation to heavy quark propagation is valuable for ensuring stability .",
    "substantial effects on spin splitting were found from @xmath3 terms in the action .",
    "however further study , for example , of alternative definitions for the tadpole factor or of perturbative improvement for the nrqcd coefficients is needed before one can reach a definitive conclusion about the convergence of the nrqcd expansion for charmed mesons .",
