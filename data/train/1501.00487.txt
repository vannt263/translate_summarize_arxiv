    "one of the controversial problems with static traversable wormholes introduced by morris and thorne ( mt ) @xcite is the unphysical stress - energy tensor with negative energy density .",
    "it is shown that the matter supporting this kind of structure violates the physical laws , under which , normal matter behaves .",
    "thus , it would be a kind of exotic matter with strange behavior that violates the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "since then , so many generalizations have been done to build the mt wormhole with normal matter , which , does not violate the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "the energy conditions of general relativity are determined , in order to study the notion of  locally \" positive energy densities precisely .",
    "the energy conditions indicate that various linear combinations of the stress - energy tensor should be positive or at least non - negative @xcite .",
    "the weaker assertion of the energy conditions is the averaged energy conditions , which permit localized violation of the energy conditions , in which the energy conditions holds when integrating along null or timelike geodesics @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been done in order to avoid violation of the energy conditions . in @xcite , entering wormhole in an inflating universe was suggested , and it is proven that , the more inflation goes on , the less exotic matter needed to construct the wormhole structure .",
    "embedding of the mt wormhole in the flrw model of the universe is investigated in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , for normal matters like dust and radiation ( with equation of state @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ) for which , the scale factor is a power function of time , the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) can be avoided .",
    "a stationary axially symmetric rotating wormhole is described in @xcite , in which , the violation of the energy conditions will be avoided for some sets of geodesics entering wormhole .",
    "n - dimensional static and evolving lorentzian wormhole solutions with a cosmological constant are obtained in @xcite .    toward studying the existence of the wormholes ,",
    "they have been studied in different alternative theories of general relativity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wormhole was discussed from different points of views .",
    "for example , the conversion of a wormhole into a black hole or vise versa is discussed by hayward in new standpoint @xcite , and also refs .",
    "thermodynamics of wormholes treated in @xcite .",
    "gravitational microlensing as an observable effect of wormholes was first proposed by cramer et.al in @xcite . since then , many authors investigated the observable effects of this structure : @xcite .",
    "along with , a great deal of interest has been focused on wormholes in higher dimensions , which arises from the theories of fundamental physics , such as string theory , supergravity , kaluza - klein ( kk)@xcite    in this paper , we consider a traversable wormhole in a @xmath2-dimensional flrw spacetime , in which the fifth dimension is spacelike and is considered to be compact , on the basis of kk theory . as we know , kk theory is one of the first efforts to unify all the forces under one fundamental law .",
    "it was shown that by the addition of one extra spatial compact dimension which is considered to be as small as planck s length , gravity and electromagnetism can be unified @xcite .",
    "we have used this concept to construct our higher dimensional traversable wormhole .",
    "first , we consider dynamical compactification as the evolution of the fifth dimension @xcite .",
    "this assumption will ensure that the extra dimension remains compact and non - observable within the growth of the normal dimensions .",
    "the reason to consider such case is to discuss the following questions : `` if an extra dimension can induce a pressure which plays the role of exotic matter needed to support wormhole structure or not ? '' , or `` under what conditions these assumptions can avoid the violation of the wec ? '' . secondly , the extra dimension is assumed to be static . in both cases , we will show that the wec can be satisfied for the total energy - momentum tensor , if the cosmic matter has : @xmath3 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the five dimensional cosmological traversable wormhole is introduced .",
    "the extra dimension is assumed to be compact and its size evolves as an inverse power of the radius of our universe .",
    "then we investigate the terms and conditions under which , the wormhole solution does not violate the wec . finally , we consider the evolution of the fifth dimension to be constant and the wec will be discussed .",
    "a discussion of our result is given in section iii .",
    "let us start from the @xmath2-dimensional kk theory with the action @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar corresponding to the @xmath2-dimensional metric @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is the @xmath2-dimensional matter action .",
    "we now use units such that @xmath9 . the metric element of the @xmath2-dimensional wormhole in an flrw universe is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the spatial curvature constant with @xmath12 corresponding to a closed , flat and open universe , respectively , @xmath13 is the scale factor for three ordinary spacelike dimensions , @xmath14 is the scale factor for the fifth dimension , which is considered to be spacelike , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate ( @xmath17 ) , denote the redshift function and the form function , respectively @xcite . the range of the radial coordinate increases from its minimum value at the wormhole throat @xmath18 , to infinity .",
    "the metric is consisted of two spacetimes : flrw universe with one extra compact dimension , and the static mt traversable wormhole metric .",
    "a main property of a wormhole is the flare out condition at the throat , which is given by @xmath19 , is imposed which will preserve the shape of a traversable wormhole @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to have a wormhole solution , at the throat , @xmath20 the condition @xmath21 is imposed .",
    "in addition , to have a traversable wormhole there must be no event horizon which implies @xmath15 must be finite everywhere .",
    "the einstein s field equations for the perfect fluid with the energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath22 $ ] , in the case of zero radial tidal force wormhole ( @xmath23 ) , are given by @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 since , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 depend on both @xmath17 and @xmath32 , to solve the einstein field equations , we can choose the following ansatz @xmath33 the subscript @xmath34 refers to the cosmological part and @xmath35 refers to the wormhole part .",
    "indeed , this is due to the fact that we simply assume the wormhole is small compared to the universe . with the above ansatz ,",
    "the einstein field equations and the conservation laws are separated as @xmath36&=-\\rho_{w}(r)+\\dfrac{b'}{8 \\pi r^2}=l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37=-\\tau_{w}(r)+\\dfrac{b}{8\\pi r^3}=m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38=-p_{w}(r)-\\dfrac{1}{8\\pi}\\bigg[\\dfrac{-b}{2r^3}+\\dfrac{b'}{2r^2}\\bigg]=\\alpha,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath39&=-p_{y_{w}}(r)-\\dfrac{1}{8 \\pi}\\dfrac{b'}{r^2}=\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the separation constants independent of both @xmath32 and @xmath17 .",
    "the second term in the equation ( [ 023 ] ) , is from the extra dimension which modifies the @xmath46-dimensional energy - momentum conservation . as introduced in @xcite , we assume for the scale factor of the extra dimension to evolve as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant and the parameter @xmath49 must be positive in order to have dynamical compactification and non - observable extra dimension during the evolution of our universe .",
    "thus , as the scale factor of our universe increase in size , @xmath14 shrinks .",
    "in addition , we consider a particular solution for which the pressure along the fifth dimension vanishes . as the simplest case",
    ", one may assume @xmath50 to be constant , this makes the second term in ( [ 023 ] ) vanish @xcite .",
    "now we will focus our attention to the above cases , and investigate the solutions and discuss about the conditions needed to have the non - exotic matter maintaining the wormhole in flat universe @xmath51 . to check the wec",
    ", we define the exotic function as proposed in @xcite , @xmath52 indeed , this term plays an important role in studying the wec condition . for the static @xmath46-dimensional wormhole case @xmath53 function , is proportional to @xmath54 , which must be positive or @xmath55 , consequently , is exotic matter . in",
    "what follows , we investigate the wec in our @xmath2-dimensional wormhole .      in this subsection",
    "we consider dynamical compactification for the evolution of the fifth dimension introduced in ( [ 00020 ] ) . inserting this in equation ( [ 023 ] ) , allows us to define an effective pressure @xmath56 as @xmath57 the einstein s field equations and the conservation laws for this case are as follows @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59&=-\\rho_{w}+\\dfrac{b'}{8 \\pi r^2}=l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath60=-\\tau_{w}+\\dfrac{b}{8 \\pi r^3}=m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61=-p_{w}-\\dfrac{1}{8\\pi}\\bigg(\\dfrac{-b}{2r^3}+\\dfrac{b'}{2r^2}\\bigg)=\\alpha,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath62= -p_{y_{w}}-\\dfrac{b'}{8\\pi r^2}=\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63 \\bigg\\}=\\\\ ( n-1)\\rho_{w}-2p_{w}+\\tau_{w}+np_{y_{w}}=(1-n)l+2\\alpha - m - n\\gamma = q , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64 for the cosmological principle to be held , we must take the cosmic parts of our equations isotropic so @xmath65 , which gives @xmath66 . regarding to the fact that the cosmic part is just a function of @xmath32 and",

    "then , using equations ( [ 035 ] ) and ( [ 037 ] ) in to the equation ( [ 038 ] ) , with the above equation of state for the cosmic part , one can easily obtain the cosmic pressure along the extra dimension as @xmath69-\\bigg[\\dfrac{l(n+1)-3\\alpha-\\gamma(n-2)}{(n-2)r^2}\\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath70 from the above equation into the conservation law equation ( [ 039 ] ) , the cosmic energy - density becomes @xmath71/(n-2)}+\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\bigg [ \\dfrac{2l(n^2-n+1)-6\\alpha(n-1)}{-6\\omega(n-1)+2(n^2-n+1 ) } \\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the integration constant . using the similar procedure for the wormhole part ,",
    "we obtain @xmath73 taking into account @xmath74 obtained from the above equations , together with the equations of state for the wormhole part introduced above , into equations ( [ 035 ] ) and ( [ 037 ] ) , we obtain for the shape function , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the integration constant and other integration constants are set to be zero by the asymptotic flatness .",

    "<S> in this paper , a traversable wormhole in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model with one extra spacelike compact dimension is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen dynamical compactification as the evolution of the fifth dimension . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> we study how the existence of the extra dimension , affect the behavior of the energy density , the shape function and the scale factor . </S>",
