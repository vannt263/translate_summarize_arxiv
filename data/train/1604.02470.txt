    "cosmic inflation @xcite is a well established , consistent with the data @xcite , theory of the early universe which predicts cosmic acceleration and generation of seeds of the large scale structure of the present universe .",
    "the inflationary universe can be obtained by introduction of additional fields or by modification of general relativity ( gr ) , which is the possibility explored in this paper .",
    "the first theory of inflation is the starobinsky model @xcite , which is an @xmath3 theory @xcite with @xmath4 lagrangian density .",
    "in such a model the acceleration of space - time is generated in the empty universe , i.e. by the gravitational interaction itself .",
    "this comes from the fact that the homogeneous and isotropic @xmath5 model gives an exact de sitter solution . +",
    "the @xmath3 theory is one of the simplest generalisations of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "it is based on lagrangian density @xmath6 and it can be expressed using the so - called auxiliary field , which means that the ricci scalar is treated as a independent scalar degree of freedom . in such a case",
    "one defines @xmath7 by @xmath8 and the jordan frame ( jf ) action is equal to @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the jordan frame ( jf ) potential , which is related to energy density of the field , but its derivative is not an effective force in the eom of q. for @xmath13 one recovers gr , which is usually positioned at @xmath14 .",
    "note that the variation of the jf action with respect to @xmath7 gives @xmath15 .",
    "therefore one obtains a constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath16 , which is valid whenever @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 the constraint is satisfied for any relation between @xmath7 and @xmath16 , and therefore we lose one - to - one correspondence between the scalar picture and the original @xmath3 theory .",
    "the jordan frame auxiliary field can also be defined as @xmath19 .",
    "this convention requires an exact form of the function @xmath20 , however obtaining such a form is not always possible .",
    "+ the same model can be expressed in the einstein frame ( ef ) , with the metric tensor defined as @xmath21 .",
    "this is a purely classical transformation of coordinates and results obtained in one frame are classically perfectly equivalent to the ones from another frame .",
    "the ef action is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ef ricci scalar , auxiliary field and potential respectively .",
    "the ef potential should have a minimum at the gr vacuum , which is positioned at @xmath26 .",
    "the auxiliary field @xmath27 may be used as an inflaton or a source of the dark energy , which makes the @xmath3 theory a powerful theoretical tool to solve problems of classical cosmology .",
    "+ a separate issue related to @xmath3 inflation concerns loop corrections to the f(r ) function .",
    "note that the @xmath5 term in the starobinsky model was originally motivated by one - loop correction to gr , which in principle could be extended into series of higher order loop corrections . in order to obtain quasi de sitter evolution of space - time",
    "one needs a wide range of energies for which the @xmath28 term dominates the lagrangian density .",
    "this would require all higher order corrections ( such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 etc . )",
    "@xcite to be suppressed by a mass scale much bigger than @xmath31 .",
    "one naturally expects all higher order correction to gr to appear at the same energy scale if one wants to avoid fine - tuning of coefficients of all higher order terms .",
    "thus , the influence of higher order corrections on the starobinsky model may spoil the flatness of the einstein frame potential and prevent the early universe from inflating . the saddle - point inflation generated by higher order corrections to starobinsky model was already analysed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis as follows : we assume that the einstein frame potential of the @xmath3 theory with higher order terms up to @xmath32 has a flat area around any of its stationary points .",
    "we do not assume where such a point is , we simply require that the potential is as flat as possible around it , namely that first @xmath33 derivatives of @xmath34 are equal to zero at this point , which gives certain relations between @xmath35 coefficients .",
    "we describe implications of such extreme flatness .",
    "we also investigate the issue of stability of the gr vacuum of the model .",
    "we stress that our point of view is that whatever corrections have been computed there exists an effective classical action that can be studied and this is what we do in this paper .",
    "our approach also covers the case that higher order corrections come from the taylor expansion of some fundamental , unknown @xmath3 theory .",
    "+ in what follows we use the convention @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the reduced planck mass .",

    "finally we summarise in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we require the existence of a stationary point ( i.e. extremum or saddle point ) anywhere in the einstein frame potential besides the minimum in @xmath26 , which is the gr vacuum .",
    "we require the potential around a stationary point to be as flat as possible for a given @xmath3 function .",
    "we want to find out whether this requirement will determine the shape of @xmath39 outside of the domain of a stationary point .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath3 function is the following sum of @xmath40 terms @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a natural number .",
    "in order to obtain the correct gr limit one requires @xmath43 . without any loss of generality one can choose @xmath44 to be any positive constant ,",
    "so for simplicity we set @xmath45 .",

    "all @xmath52 for @xmath53 are equivalent to @xmath54 . in case of a saddle point",
    "there is a deeper motivation to consider @xmath51 with many vanishing derivatives .",
    "the saddle point with @xmath55 and @xmath56 gives spectral index @xmath57 , which is inconsistent with the planck data . on the other hand the saddle point with first @xmath38 derivatives vanishing , which was analysed in ref .",

    "any given @xmath59 one can obtain maximally @xmath33 vanishing derivatives of the einstein frame potential for some @xmath60 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath16 and @xmath5 automaticly satisfy @xmath61 for any non - zero @xmath62 . assuming the maximal number of vanishing derivatives one obtains @xmath63 where @xmath51 is a saddle point ( local maximum ) of @xmath34 for even ( odd ) @xmath1 respectively .",

    "the second one is the possible instability of the gr vacuum at @xmath72 .",
    "for @xmath73 the only minimum is the anti de sitter minimum at certain @xmath74 . in order to create a potential barrier between the possibly unstable gr vacuum and anti de sitter vacuum one needs @xmath75 , which will be analysed in detail in the section [ sec : stable ] .",

    "@xmath1 the results are exactly the same , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 have the same @xmath1 dependence as in the even @xmath1 scenario . for any finite @xmath1",

    "@xcite we have investigated the issue of higher order corrections to the jf potential in brans - dicke theory .",
    "we have proven that in the presence of higher order corrections one can still obtain flat areas of the einstein frame potential , for instance around a saddle point .",
    "nevertheless such a saddle point is not maximally flat , i.e. we required in ref .",
