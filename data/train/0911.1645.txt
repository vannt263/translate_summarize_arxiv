    "studying high energy hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus reactions provides an opportunity to investigate strong interactions . of fundamental interest are bulk observables such as multiplicity and particle densities ( spectra ) , which are sensitive tools for probing the dynamics of strong interactions .",
    "they give information about the system formed in these collisions .",
    "comparative studies of different colliding systems ( h+h , h+a , a+a ) enable distinguishing between various particle production scenarios .    some aspects of these comparisons are not well understood .",
    "this paper covers two such subjects . in section  [ wnqm ] ,",
    "results on the most basic observable , i.e. , * multiplicity of particles * , from h+h , h+a and a+a reactions at different energies , are shown .",
    "there are predictions of the wounded nucleon and wounded quark models confronted with the yields measured experimentally .",
    "the evolution of transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra , expressed in terms of a so - called * nuclear modification factor * , with rapidity @xmath1 ( or feynman @xmath2 ) and energy is discussed in section  [ nmf ] .",
    "these results concern hadron - nucleus collisions and are in relevance to saturation and/or golor glass condensate effects .",
    "finally , section  [ sum ] summarizes the presented issues .",
    "more than thirty years ago a concept of _ wounded _ nucleons was introduced  @xcite .",
    "a wounded nucleon ( often called also a _ participant _ ) is a nucleon that underwent at least one inelastic collision .",
    "the wounded nucleon model ( wnm ) proposes that particle production in a nuclear collision is a superposition of independent contributions from the wounded nucleons in the projectile and in the target .",
    "thus , the ratio of the number of charged particles produced in h+a collisions ( @xmath3 ) to that in p+p collisions ( @xmath4 ) is : @xmath5 where : @xmath6 is the number of wounded nucleons ( participants ) in h+a , and `` 2 '' means that there are two participants in a proton - proton collision .",
    "a remarkable success of wnm is seen in the inset of figure  [ fig : ha_aa ] , where the total charged particle multiplicity from hadron - nucleus collisions is divided by the p+p multiplicity at the same collision energy .",
    "the ratio remains directly proportional to half the number of nucleon participants in h+a , as all points fall on the indicated line .",
    "ratios of total particle multiplicity data for hadron - nucleus collisions ( d+au at @xmath7=200  gev and @xmath8+a , k+a , and p+a at @xmath910 - 20  gev ) and nucleus - nucleus collisions ( au+au at @xmath7=19.6 and 200  gev ) over the multiplicity in proton(antiproton)-proton interactions plotted versus the number of participating nucleons .",
    "the denominator for h+a interactions is p(p)+p data at the same @xmath7 . for au+au interactions ,",
    "the denominator is p(p)+p data at twice the center - of - mass energy .",
    "@xcite ]    a similar analysis of nucleus - nucleus data is shown in the main part of figure  [ fig : ha_aa ] .",
    "again , the points fall along the line , exhibiting scaling of the total multiplicity with the number of participant pairs . in this case , however , wnm does not work as the reference p+p data are taken at twice the center - of - mass energy ( to account for `` leading particle '' effect ) .",
    "total charged particle multiplicity per participant pair as a function of number of participants .",
    "data are shown for a+a and p(p)+p collisions at @xmath7 of @xmath1020 , 62.4 and 200  gev , as well as d+au at 200  gev .",
    "@xcite ]    also figure  [ fig : tot_aa ] supports this statement .",
    "the total charged particle multiplicity per participant pair , for a+a , clearly exceeds the multiplicity from p+p collisions at the same energy .",
    "still , the proportionality of these multiplicities to the number of nucleon participants holds , as a flat dependence on @xmath11 is seen .",
    "particle density at mid - rapidity , @xmath12 , divided by a )  the number of nucleon participant pairs , b )  the number of constituent - quark participant pairs for au+au and p(p)+p collisions at three energies .",
    "@xcite ]    charged particle densities ( @xmath12 ) per nucleon participant pair at mid - rapidity in a+a collisions are substantially higher than those in p+p collisions at the same energy , as shown in figure  [ fig : quark_aa]a , pointing to the failure of wnm .",
    "in addition , there is the dependence on collision centrality observed , reflecting the violation of @xmath11-scaling .",
    "one may ask here how the results change if quark participants are used in the normalization , instead of nucleon participants .",
    "+      the concept of wounded quarks has been known for many years  @xcite .",
    "results presented below are from the approach where both nuclei and single nucleons are considered as a superposition of constituent quarks ; there are three such quarks per nucleon .",
    "the number of participating objects is estimated using the nuclear overlap model  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear density profile is assumed to have a woods - saxon form . in order to calculate the number of participating quarks ( @xmath13 ) the density",
    "was increased three times and the nucleon - nucleon cross section was changed to the quark - quark one . when the a+a results for mid - rapidity particle density are normalized to the number of quark participant pairs ( figure  [ fig : quark_aa]b ) the centrality dependence flattens out .",
    "this arises from the relative increase in the number of interacting quarks in more central collisions .",
    "the approximate scaling with @xmath13 is observed , which means that the wounded quark model ( wqm ) works quite well here .",
    "the same approach has also been applied to identified particle production at sps and rhic energies  @xcite . however , the treatment of the sps data ( na49  @xcite ) was inconsistent ; the authors mixed the integrated yields with mid - rapidity yields for different particles . therefore",
    ", a new analysis of the na49 data has been performed  @xcite .",
    "recent data on pion and kaon production in pb+pb collisions at @xmath7=17.2  gev  @xcite were studied .",
    "in addition , c+c and si+si collisions  @xcite were included in the study . as an example",
    ", the total @xmath14 yield was found to scale with the number of participating nucleons - @xmath15 , and k@xmath16 with quarks - @xmath13 ( see figure  [ fig : id_prod_sps ] ) .",
    "similar findings have been obtained for the na35 data where production rates of h@xmath17 appeared to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons , and k@xmath18 - to the number of wounded quarks  @xcite .",
    "transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra of particles produced in nuclear collisions are subject to various initial and final state effects .",
    "initial state effects may enhance the yield - like the cronin effect which strengthens it at intermediate-@xmath0 in p+a and a+a collisions as compared to p+p interactions , or suppress the yield - like nuclear shadowing and gluon saturation .",
    "parton energy loss ( final state effect ) , due to gluon _ bremsstrahlung _ during the passage through a very dense and colored medium created in ultra - relativistic a+a collisions , leads to the suppression of hadron yields at high-@xmath0 ( jet - quenching ) .",
    "the degree of suppression / enhancement is quantified by means of the nuclear modification factor ( nmf ) .",
    "the initial state effects can be separated from the final state ones by studying hadron - nucleus interactions , for which the latter effects are not present , and comparing to high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "nmf for h+a collisions ( @xmath19 ) is defined as a ratio of the number of particles produced in a h+a collision over the number of particles produced in a p+p collision scaled by the number of binary collisions @xmath20 : @xmath21 @xmath20 - is the number of collisions the incident hadron would experience if it were not altered at all while passing through the nucleus a.    quite recent measurements of hadrons produced in d+au collisions at rhic , @xmath7=200  gev , showed decreasing values of nmf with increasing ( pseudo)rapidity of the particle  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : rhic_dau ] ) . the observed suppression",
    "can be qualitatively described within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model  @xcite , which assumes gluon saturation for the kinematic domain reached in hadron - nucleus collisions at rhic .",
    "the saturation effects are expected to be more pronounced at large feynman @xmath2 , or large ( pseudo)rapidity , where small-@xmath22 partons in the nucleus can be probed .",
    "the effects should also increase with the thickness of nuclear material traversed by the incoming probe , and indeed a greater suppression for more central d+au collisions was observed  @xcite .",
    "a similar suppression like at rhic was measured also in p+pb collisions at sps , as shown in figure  [ fig : sps_pa ] .",
    "nuclear modification factor @xmath23 , in different @xmath2 intervals , for a )  @xmath24 , b )  @xmath14 , c )  @xmath25 and d )  @xmath26 produced in central p+pb collisions at @xmath7=17.2  gev .",
    "@xcite , width=264,height=226 ]    the measurements of @xmath27 by na49  @xcite at an order of magnitude lower energy , where shadowing and gluon saturation are expected to be small , show qualitatively the same rapidity ( or @xmath28 ) dependence .",
    "nmf decreases with @xmath28 for pions as well as for p and p.    the energy dependence of the suppression is related to underlying space - time dynamics of the collision and is therefore a crucial test for theoretical models .",
    "two approaches to study the energy dependence of the suppression ( taking into account also the sps result ) were proposed  @xcite .",
    "both use the glauber - gribov model , but differ in technicalities .",
    "the studies were done in terms of `` standard '' effects , such as energy - momentum conservation , shadowing and cronin effect .",
    "effects related to color glass condensate were not included in the models .",
    "the study within the first approach  @xcite showed a good agreement with sps and rhic data on pion production .",
    "in addition , data at both energies seem to overlap ( for @xmath2 dependence ) .",
    "this indicates that common mechanisms determine the suppression in the forward region both at sps and rhic .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhic_sps_n ] shows predictions of the second model  @xcite .",
    "the rhic results are nicely described by the model ( upper panel ) .",
    "this means , most likely , that a region where cgc - based models can fully be employed has not been reached at rhic .",
    "the description of the sps data is worse ( lower panel ) .",
    "model calculations and experimental data on nmf .",
    "upper panel : @xmath29 for negative hadrons and neutral pions at pseudorapidity @xmath30=3.2 and 4.0  @xcite .",
    "lower panel : @xmath27 for @xmath31 at @xmath2=0.025 and 0.375  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=170 ]   model calculations and experimental data on nmf .",

    "-  some characteristics of particle production in high energy nuclear collisions scale with @xmath15 , other with @xmath13 .",
    "e.g. , for a+a at sps , the @xmath8 yield scales with @xmath15 and k yield with @xmath13 .",
    "-  suppression in the forward region in h+a collisions is present not only at rhic but also at sps .",
    "understanding of the effect and its energy dependence needs more theoretical study .",
