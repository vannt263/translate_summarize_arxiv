    "a simple way to build stable models of triaxial stellar systems is to start from a spherical distribution of point masses and to follow its collapse with an @xmath0body code .",
    "if the initial velocity dispersion is low ( i.e. , if the original distribution is @xmath1 ) the radial orbit instability leads the evolution of the system towards a triaxial stable state @xcite .",
    "models that are cuspy ( i.e. , where near the centre the density , @xmath2 , is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius and @xmath5 ) and non cuspy ( i.e. , with a flat density distribution near the center ) can be built in this way .",
    "the orbital structure of such models has been the subject of several investigations over the past decade : see , e.g , @xcite for non cuspy models ; or @xcite for cuspy ones ; some authors @xcite even considered the effects of central black holes on the orbital structure of their systems .",
    "all of these investigations found large fractions of chaotic orbits in their models , and those fractions were particularly high for the cuspy models and those with central black holes .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite starting from a spherical @xcite model which they adiabatically deformed to obtain a triaxial system , only found a negligibly small fraction of chaotic orbits .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xcite have already suggested that @xcite might have missed many chaotic orbits due to the algorithm they employed to detect them . besides",
    ", one should recall that cold collapses necessarily result in models with strongly anisotropic velocity distributions , because strongly radial orbits are produced by those collapses , while the model of @xcite has a much more isotropic velocity distribution ( see their fig .",
    "5 , lower right ) . now",
    ", chaotic orbits with low angular momenta had already been found in models of our galaxy by @xcite and , since then , further evidence that low angular momentum favors the onset of chaos has been accumulating ; for example , fig .",
    "7 of @xcite shows that much higher fractions of chaotic orbits are found among their `` stationary start space '' orbits than among their `` @xmath6 start space '' ones .",
    "therefore , it is also possible that the difference in velocity anisotropy may help to explain the different chaotic content of the collapse models and that of @xcite .",
    "while the use of an @xmath0body code might seem to guarantee the obtention of stable models , that is not so , and the constancy of their macroscopic properties over intervals of the order of a hubble time should always be checked .",
    "although @xcite investigated the stability of their model , they did it over a time interval that was only a fraction of the hubble time , so that a check over a longer interval is warranted .",
    "thus , we decided to reinvestigate a model similar to the one of @xcite , checking its long term stability and obtaining the fraction of chaotic orbits with different techniques ( section 2 ) .",
    "besides , we chose one of the models from the first paper in this series @xcite to `` isotropize '' its velocity distribution , rendering it much less radially oriented , and we also adiabatically deformed the resulting system to obtain two additional ones ; we subsequently obtained the fraction of chaotic orbits in the three isotropized models ( section 3 ) .",
    "section 4 of the present paper presents our conclusions .",
    "the first part of our work investigates the stability of a model similar to that of @xcite and its chaotic content . to build the model we began by setting up an isotropic hernquist model @xcite from its phase space distribution function : @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a point of the phase space , @xmath9 is the total mass of the model , @xmath10 stands for its length scale , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath13 , being @xmath14 the energy per unit mass of a star in the potential @xmath15 given by : @xmath16 in these equations we have used the usual notations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the density profile turns out to be @xmath19 since the density diverges as @xmath20 at the origin , we say that the profile has a cusp of ( inverse ) slope @xmath21 .",
    "we set @xmath22 as @xcite did , yielding an overall crossing time of @xmath23 time units ( t.u .",
    "hereafter ) .",
    "we then generated @xmath24 particles according to the above distribution .    to obtain a triaxial system , we began by evolving the hernquist model using the self - consistent field ( scf ) code of @xcite with @xmath25 radial terms ( the first one of which reproduces the spherical hernquist profile ) and @xmath26 angular terms and , at the same time , squeezing the system along the @xmath27 axis while maintaining its axial symmetry by setting to zero all odd terms of the scf expansion .",
    "the squeezing was done by dragging the @xmath27 component of the velocities with the recipe of @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time step of the integration and @xmath30 is the squeezing factor given by : @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the time elapsed since the beginning of the dragging , @xmath33 is the interval during which the drag grows , and @xmath34 is an overall factor . after the @xmath27-dragging reached its full strength , the system was evolved for a time @xmath35 and , then , the drag was smoothly turned off by means of @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the time of decay of the drag . except for @xmath29 ,",
    "whose value is not given by @xcite and that we took as @xmath38 , we adopted the same values used by them , that is : @xmath39 t.u . ; @xmath40 t.u .",
    ", and @xmath41t.u.@xmath42 .",
    "once the @xmath27 drag was over , the system was rescaled in positions and velocities in order to recover the original value of the energy .",
    "we then applied the same procedure just described to squeeze the system along the @xmath43 axis , and the system was rescaled once again to recover the initial energy value . for the @xmath43 dragging the requirement of axisymmetry",
    "was lifted and @xmath34 was taken as @xmath44t.u.@xmath42 , again , the same value used by @xcite . finally , following their procedure , we let the system evolve until @xmath45 t.u .",
    "( corresponding to about @xmath46 ) to reach an equilibrium state ; for this evolution , as well as the longer one described below , the timestep of integration was taken as @xmath47 .",
    "the properties of the final model are presented in fig .",
    "[ como5dehbea ] which was prepared in the same way as fig . 5 of @xcite to underline the strong similarity of their model and ours .",
    "just as they did , we use the ellipsoidal radius : @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and its two dimensional projection , @xmath50 .",
    "the semiaxes , @xmath51 and @xmath52 were computed following the recipe of @xcite , as adapted by @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mean square tangential and radial velocities , respectively , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the corresponding velocity dispersions , and @xmath57 is the anisotropy parameter , defined as usual as @xmath58 .",
    "the density and the velocity dispersions were computed using constant axial ratios evaluated at the half - mass radius . a comparison of our fig .",
    "[ como5dehbea ] with fig .",
    "5 of @xcite clearly shows that both systems are very similar indeed .",
    "the time evolutions of the central slope , @xmath59 , and of the @xmath60 and @xmath52 semiaxes of our model ( not shown here ) are also very similar to those shown by @xcite in their figs . 2 and 3 , but we should recall that the time interval that they let their model relax was only 80 t.u .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we let our system relax for an additional interval of @xmath61 t.u.,i.e .",
    ", about @xmath62 , in order to verify whether it had truly reached equilibrium .",
    "[ gammatl ] shows the resulting evolution of the central slope computed from the innermost 10,000 particles divided in 100 particles bins , and it is clear from the figure not only that the system had not yet achieved equilibrium at @xmath45 , but also that the central cusp flattens strongly , falling to @xmath63 after a @xmath62 evolution .    , when the system is let to relax @xmath62 . ]    , when the system is let to relax @xmath62 . ]",
    "alternatively , when we computed the evolution of the semiaxes corresponding to @xmath64 and 2 , we found that they maintained reasonably well the values reached at @xmath45 t.u .",
    "[ semistl ] ) . nevertheless , the evolution of the semiaxes of a further ellipsoidal slice of the system , the one which encompasses 80 per cent of the most tightly bound particles , corresponding to about @xmath65 at the start of the simulation , ( fig .",
    "[ semis80tl ] ) shows that these semiaxes are strongly out of equilibrium until at least @xmath66 t.u .",
    "thus , although in order to compare our results with those of @xcite , we will investigate in what follows the chaoticity of the model obtained from the @xmath45 t.u .",
    "snapshot , it should be borne in mind that the system has not reached equilibrium and is still evolving .    .",
    "]      in order to establish the fraction of chaotic orbits present in the system , we began by repeating the procedure of @xcite .",
    "we selected at random 5,000 particles from the @xmath45 t.u .",
    "snapshot , and used them as initial conditions to integrate orbits .",
    "the integrations were performed in the potential generated by the scf code using the complete collection of particles to which , following @xcite and in order to reduce the noise in the computation of the potential , we added seven additional sets of particles in each of which the particles were replicated in a different octant in coordinates as well as in velocities .",
    "then we followed each orbit with a runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator of order 7/8 , over a time interval of 900 orbital periods , and we used the coordinates and velocities of the first and the last 300 period intervals to obtain the dominant frequencies of the orbit in those intervals , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "those frequencies were obtained with the modified fourier transform algorithm , first developed by @xcite and later on improved by @xcite , using 8,192 points for each 300 period interval .",
    "the complex variables we used had the coordinates as their real part and the corresponding velocity component as the imaginary part .",
    "of the three resulting frequencies ( one for each coordinate ) we chose for the analysis the one that corresponded to the largest amplitude in the first 300 period interval . if the orbit were regular , its fundamental frequency should not change , i.e. , @xmath69 ; on the contrary , a chaotic orbit should show @xmath70 . in order to perform the comparison of @xmath67 with @xmath68 and",
    "determine if they are different ( in a numerical sense ) , we followed the recipe of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , that is , we checked whether @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a frequency of reference defined in @xcite as `` the frequency of a tube orbit about the long axis '' , @xmath73 is defined as `` the time interval '' , and the constant inside the square root is our equivalent of the constant used by @xcite .",
    "as @xmath74 is compared against a constant to determine chaoticity , we felt that the reference frequency @xmath72 should not be that of just any long axis tube .",
    "thus , we first chose to compute @xmath72 from the long axis tube with the same energy of the orbit being classified .",
    "but this led to a rather time - consuming and complicated algorithm , so we shifted to the original reference frequency defined in @xcite , i.e. , that of the long axis orbit with the same energy of the orbit being classified . as these orbits pass",
    "exactly through the origin , and the potential diverges there , we sligthly perturbed the initial conditions in order to avoid that point .",
    "with respect to @xmath73 , we assumed that it corresponds to the time span from the first sample of the orbit used to compute @xmath67 to the last sample of the orbit used to compute @xmath68 .",
    "( [ deltaf ] ) , of the 5,000 selected orbits , as a function of orbital energy . ]",
    "we found that , according to this criterium , none of the orbits was chaotic . moreover , the values of @xmath74 lay in all cases well below the threshold value ( fig .",
    "[ dft ] ) .",
    "let us note that a ) there is no clue as to where the limit between regular and chaotic orbits may be ; b ) if the ( arbitrary ? ) factor 0.05 in inequality ( [ deltaf ] ) were changed to another , much lower , value chaos would have been found ; and c ) a dimensional analysis of inequality ( [ deltaf ] ) reveals that the first member has units of time@xmath75 , whereas the second member is a dimensionless constant .",
    "thus , inequality ( [ deltaf ] ) seems to be problematic .",
    "we therefore explored the possibility of detecting chaos with other indicators based on frequency differences .",
    "we used @xmath74 without the @xmath73 factor : @xmath76 the relative difference , but referred to the original frequency : @xmath77 and the absolute difference between frequencies , @xmath78 without imposing any a priori threshold .",
    "the plots of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 versus the orbital energy turned out to be very similar to that of fig .",
    "[ dft ] , giving no clue as to where to set a limiting value separating regular from chaotic orbits .",
    "therefore , the question remains : where is to be put the limit between regular and chaotic orbits , if there is such a limit at all ?",
    "we can not answer for sure until we manage to get some additional evidence from another point of view .",
    "we decided to analyse the chaotic content of the model using lyapunov exponents which constitute , numerical issues aside , the very definition of chaos .",
    "as in our previous papers , we used the liamag routine @xcite to compute finite time lyapunov characteristic numbers ( ft - lcns ) .",
    "we took the same random sample of 5,000 initial conditions from the @xmath45 t.u .",
    "system we had used for the frequency analysis and we integrated the orbits in the potential generated by the scf over @xmath82280,000 t.u .",
    "( i.e. , 20,000 @xmath83 ) ; the renormalization interval was set as 28 t.u .",
    "[ lyapu ] shows the largest ft - lcn , @xmath84 , as a function of the energy of the orbits and , while fig .",
    "[ dft ] gave no hint about where to place a limit separating regular from chaotic orbits , here there is a clearly defined limit at @xmath85 .",
    "the same limiting value can be found from a similar plot for the second positive ft - lcn , and one can use it to refine the classification by separating chaotic orbits into totally chaotic ( having the two largest ft - lcns greater than @xmath86 ) and partially chaotic ( having only the largest ft - lcn greater than @xmath86 ) .",
    "the resulting classification was 73.1 per cent of regular orbits and 26.9 per cent of chaotic orbits , of which 21.1 per cent were totally chaotic and the remaining 5.7 per cent partially chaotic .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the less than 1 per cent chaotic content found by @xcite , but not surprising considering our results with the frequency difference technique that they had used .",
    "is also shown . ]",
    "we checked the abovementioned results by computing another chaos indicator , namely the sali @xcite .",
    "[ lyasali ] shows the relationship between the largest ft - lcn and the sali .",
    "we can see the typical bridge of this kind of plots , joining regular and chaotic orbits ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "3 ) . taking sali @xmath87 as a typical limiting value between regularity and chaocity , we obtained 73.8 per cent of regular orbits and 26.2 per cent of chaotic ones .",
    "of course , the sali does not allow further classification into fully and partially chaotic orbits but it is clear that the ft - lcn and the sali give essentially the same classification into regular and chaotic orbits with only a handful of exceptions .",
    "compared to the excellent agreement between the ft - lcn and the sali , the correlation between any of the frequency difference indicators and the ft - lcn is very poor , as shown by fig .",
    "[ lyadif ] , which presents @xmath80 versus the largest ft - lcn , @xmath84 , for our sample of orbits ( similar plots were obtained with @xmath74 , @xmath79 and @xmath81 , and are not shown ) .",
    "the only good agreement that can be found is for low values of the frequency differences , that correspond also to low values of the ft - lcns . for larger values of the frequency differences , instead",
    ", we found essentially a vertical cloud of points where , for the same value of frequency diference , coexist ft - lcn values that correspond to regular and to chaotic orbits , and no correlation between frequency differences and ft - lcns is apparent within the cloud either .",
    "again , no clear separation between low and high frequency difference values is apparent and any vertical line that one traces will render an arbitrary limit only .",
    "it is worth recalling that the poorer perfomance of frequency differences as compared to other chaos detectors had already been noted by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "this is probably one reason why the results of @xcite differed so much from those of others which used ft - lcns or salis as chaos detection techniques .    to be fair ,",
    "it should be recognized that the computing times of the frequency differences are much shorter than those of the ft - lcns or the salis . in our case ,",
    "for example , the computation time for the frequency differences was about 4.5 times shorter than that for the ft - lcns . nevertheless , although increasing the number of periods and the time interval to 4,800 periods ( i.e. , 16 times 300 ) does improve the results of the method of frequency differences , the improvement is still not enough to provide a good separation of regular from chaotic orbits .",
    "[ histo ] presents the histograms of the frequency differences for 300 ( above ) and 4,800 periods ( below ) , separately for the orbits shown to be regular and chaotic by the ft - lcns .",
    "even though the computation time for the frequency differences with 4,800 periods was about 3.5 times that for the ft - lcns , they still do not allow a clear separation of regular from chaotic orbits .",
    "the large number of regular orbits that have high frequency differences is probably due to the presence of nearby lines that are difficult to separate with the fourier technique , but the increased number of chaotic orbits with very low frequency differences is more puzzling .",
    "perhaps the very large intervals used to compute the frequencies ( 4,800 periods ) contribute to average the frequency changes that can be expected from those orbits .",
    "more details on the use of the frequency differences for chaos detection can be found on the recent paper by @xcite , but it should be stressed that our main interest was just to show that their use may have caused the extremely low fraction of chaotic orbits found by @xcite , rather than providing a full analysis of the advantages and disadvantage of the different chaos indicators .",
    "@xcite follow @xcite in arguing that orbits with low frequency differences , although chaotic , have diffusion times too slow to substantially alter the shape of the system over time intervals of the order of a hubble time but , in fact , the system can be highly stable even when containing strongly chaotic orbits , as was shown by @xcite and as we will show again later on in the present paper .",
    "moreover , quite a few orbits have ft - lcns in excess of @xmath88t.u.@xmath42 , that is , lyapunov times shorter than 100 t.u . and , since @xmath23 t.u .",
    ", they can hardly be called weakly chaotic .    from the point of view of galactic dynamics what really matters to distinguish orbits in a model",
    "is whether they have the same distribution or not and , to investigate that issue , table [ semiorb ] gives the root mean squared values of each cartesian coordinate , computed from eleven orbital points of every orbit in each set , and the corresponding ratios together with their errors .",
    "as we have shown before @xcite , regular , partially and fully chaotic orbits in non cuspy systems have different degrees of flattening . for the cuspy models of @xcite those differences were less obvious , as they are for the present model as shown in columns five and six of the table .",
    "the likely cause is the presence of the cusp itself , that should induce more chaotic behaviour in the orbits that come nearer to it .",
    "that is confirmed by columns two , three and four of the same table , where we see that regular orbits have a much more extended distribution than partially chaotic orbits and that these have a more extended distribution than fully chotic orbits .",
    "that is , from the point of view of galactic dynamics the separation of the orbits we have made here is highly relevant .",
    "[ hbea ] presents , for the regular ( above ) and chaotic ( below ) orbits , the plots of their reduced energy versus their reduced initial angular momentum , the normalizing factors being the potential energy at the center of the system and the maximum angular momentum , respectively ; the latter was computed assuming circular orbits in a hernquist potential . both partially and fully chaotic orbits were bunched together , as chaotic , for clarity .",
    "the left portion of the energies ( i.e. , energies close to zero ) has exclusively regular orbits , in agreement with the results of table [ semiorb ] ; on the right part , its is clear that the chaotic orbits tend to have lower angular momenta than the regular orbits of the same energy , confirming that low angular momenta favor the onset of chaos .    , eq .",
    "( [ deltaf2 ] ) , versus the maximal ft - lcns for the sampled 5000 orbits . ]    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as in our previous papers @xcite , we used frequency analysis to classify the regular orbits and the results are presented in table [ regul ] together with those for our e3b and e4c previous models , for comparison .",
    "there are clear decreases in the percentages of boxes and boxlets ( bbls ) and clear increases in the percentages of outer long axis tubes ( olats ) as we go from the original to the isotropized models .",
    "the fraction of small axis tubes ( sats ) seems to be larger for the e4ci and e4cf8 models , but these models have smaller triaxility than models e3b and e4c ( see table [ clae4cf ] ) ; model e4cf6 , whose triaxiality is equal to that of model e3b , and not too different from that of model e4c , has a fraction of sats similar to the original models .",
    "the percentages of inner long axis tubes ( ilats ) seem to be smaller in the isotropized models , but these fractions are generally low anyway .",
    "we have used the adiabatic dragging of @xcite to build up a cuspy triaxial model similar to the one they had investigated . using a longer relaxation time than the one they had used we found that the model had not reached equilibrium at the latter time .",
    "the cusp , in particular , steadily reduces its slope and , after @xmath62 , it is only @xmath89 . nevertheless , we searched for chaotic orbits in that model as @xcite had done and we found that , on the one hand , the frequency difference technique they had used is not adequate and is the likely culprit of their finding almost no chaos and , on the other hand , that when other techniques ( such as lyapunov exponents and sali ) are used , it turns out that more than one fourth of the orbits are chaotic .",
    "moreover , chaoticity affects the distribution of orbits , so that it should be taken into account in the study of the structure of the model .",
    "the model of @xcite was the only cuspy and triaxial system built with the @xmath0body method where almost no chaos had been found , so that our result solves that puzzle .",
    "nevertheless , the chaotic fraction we found is still substantially lower than that of other models built with the @xmath0body method @xcite , so that we investigated whether the extreme velocity anisotropy of the latter could explain that difference .",
    "we succeeded in rendering the velocity distribution of one of the models of @xcite much less radially oriented and , thus , more isotropic and we also applied the adiabatic drag to the isotropized model to obtain two other more triaxial systems .",
    "the chaotic fractions in these models are in the 50 to 60 percent range , substantially lower than the 75 to 90 per cent range found in the models of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , although the semiaxial ratios of the 80 per cent most tightly bound particles of the isotropized models are similar to those of some of the original models , those ratios differ for other fractions of most tightly bound particles , so that the models are not strictly comparable .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that @xmath90 the isotropized models have lower chaoticity than @xmath91 of the original collapse models strongly suggests that the radially oriented orbits of the latter favored the onset of chaoticity .",
    "finally , our results clearly show that one can obtain cuspy triaxial models with fairly isotropic velocity distributions that contain large fractions of chaotic orbtis and , nevertheless , are highly stable so that , in this sense , they extend our similar previous results for models with strongly radial velocity distributions .",
