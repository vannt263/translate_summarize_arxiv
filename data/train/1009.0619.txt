    "recently , a great deal of attention has been payed to wireless sensor networks whose nodes sample a physical phenomenon ( hereinafter referred to as field ) , i.e. , air temperature , light intensity , pollution levels or rain falls , and send their measurements to a central processing unit ( or _ sink _ node ) .",
    "the sink is in charge of reconstructing the sensed field : if the field can be approximated as bandlimited in the time and space domain , then an estimate of the discrete spectrum can be obtained .",
    "however , the sensors measurements typically represent an irregular sampling of the field of interest , thus the sink operates based on a set of field samples that are not regularly spaced in the time and space domain .",
    "the reasons for such an irregular sampling are multifold .",
    "( i ) the sensors may be irregularly deployed in the geographical region of interest , either due to the adopted deployment procedure ( e.g. , sensors thrown out of an airplane @xcite ) , or due to the presence of terrain asperities and obstacles .",
    "( ii ) the transmission of the measurements from the sensors to the central controller may fail due to bad channel propagation conditions ( e.g. , fading ) , or because collisions occur among the transmissions by sensors simultaneously attempting to access the channel . in this case , although the sample has been collected by the sensor , it will not be delivered to the central controller .",
    "( iii ) the sensors may enter a low - power operational state ( sleep mode ) , in order to save energy  @xcite . while in sleep mode , the nodes neither perform sensing operations nor transmit / receive any measurement .",
    "( iv ) the sensors may be loosely synchronized , hence sense the field at different time instants .",
    "clearly , sampling irregularities may result in a degradation of the reconstructed signal  @xcite .",
    "the work in  @xcite investigates this issue in the context of sensor networks .",
    "other interesting studies can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite , just to name a few , which address the perturbations of regular sampling in shift - invariant spaces  @xcite and the reconstruction of irregularly sampled images in presence of measure noise  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "our objective is to evaluate the performance of the field reconstruction when the coordinates in the @xmath0-dimensional domain of the field samples , which reach the sink node , are randomly , independently distributed and the sensors measurements are noisy . we take as performance metric the mean square error ( mse ) on the reconstructed field . as a reconstruction technique , we use linear filtering and we adopt the filter that minimizes the mse ( i.e. , the lmmse filter )  @xcite . the matrix representing the sampling system , in the following denoted by @xmath2 ,",
    "results to be a @xmath0-fold vandermonde matrix matrix @xmath5 is vandermonde if its @xmath6th entry , @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 , @xmath9 . ] . by drawing on the results in  @xcite",
    ", we derive both the moments and an expression of the limiting spectral distribution ( lsd ) of @xmath3 , as the size of @xmath2 goes to infinity and its aspect ratio has a finite limit bounded away from zero .",
    "then , by using such an asymptotic model , we approximate the mse on the reconstructed field through the @xmath4-transform  @xcite of @xmath3 , and derive an expression for it .",
    "we apply our results to the study of network scenarios of practical interest , such as sensor sensor deployments with coverage holes , communication in presence of a fading channel , massively dense networks  @xcite , and networks using contention - based channel access techniques  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : related ] reviews previous work , while section  [ sec : system ] describes the system model under study . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we first provide some useful definitions and introduce our performance metric , then we recall previous results on which we build our analysis . in section  [ sec : results - vandermonde ] , we derive asymptotic results concerning the moments and the lsd of @xmath3 .",
    "such results are applied to different practical scenarios in section  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "in the context of sensor networks , several works @xcite have studied the field reconstruction at the sink node in presence of spatial and temporal correlation among sensor measurements . in particular , in  @xcite",
    "the observed field is a discrete vector of target positions and sensor observations are dependent . by modeling the sensor network as a channel encoder and exploiting some concepts from coding theory , the network capacity , defined as the maximum value of the ratio of the target positions to the number of sensors , is studied as a function of the noise , the sensing function and the sensor connectivity level .",
    "the paper by dong and tong  @xcite considers a dense sensor network where a mac protocol is responsible to collect samples from network nodes .",
    "the work analyzes the impact of deterministic and random data collection strategies on the quality of field reconstruction . as a performance measure ,",
    "the maximum of the reconstruction square error over the sensed field is employed , as opposed to our work where the mean square error is considered .",
    "also , in @xcite the field is a gaussian random process and the sink always receives a sufficiently large number of samples so as to reconstruct the field with the required accuracy .",
    "the problem of reconstructing a bandlimited field from a set of irregular samples at unknown locations , instead , has been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "there , the field is oversampled by irregularly spaced sensors ; sensor positions are unknown but always equal to an integer multiple of the sampling interval .",
    "different solution methods are proposed , and the conditions for which there exist multiple solutions or a unique solution are discussed . differently from  @xcite , we assume that the sink can either acquire or estimate the sensor locations and that the coordinates of the sampling points are randomly located over a finite @xmath0-dimensional domain .    as for previous results on vandermonde matrices , in  @xcite ryan and debbah considered a vandermonde matrix @xmath2 with @xmath10 and complex exponential entries , whose phases are i.i.d . with continuous distribution .",
    "under such hypothesis , they obtained the important results that , given the phases distribution , the moments of @xmath3 can be derived once the moments for the case with uniformly distributed phases are known .",
    "also , a method for computing the moments of sums and products of vandermonde matrices , for the non - folded case ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , has recently appeared in  @xcite ; further insights on the extremal eigenvalues behavior , still for the case of non - folded vandermonde matrices , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite it has been shown that the lsd of @xmath3 converges to the marenko - pastur distribution  @xcite when @xmath2 is @xmath0-fold vandermonde with uniformly distributed phases and @xmath11 .    note that , with respect to previous studies on vandermonde matrices with entries that are randomly distributed on the complex unit circle , in this work we obtain results on the lsd of @xmath3 where the entries of @xmath2 have phases drawn from a _ generic continuous distribution_. by relying on the results in  @xcite , we show that such an lsd can be related to that of @xmath3 when the phases of @xmath2 are _ uniformly _ distributed on the complex unit circle .",
    "we also provide some numerical results that show the validity of our analysis . to our knowledge",
    ", these results have not been previously derived .",
    "we then apply them to the study of several practical scenarios in the context of sensor networks , although our findings can be useful for the study of other aspects of communications as well  @xcite .",
    "we consider a network composed of @xmath12 wireless sensors , which measure the value of a spatially - finite physical field defined over @xmath0 dimensions , ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the hypercube over which the sampling points fall , and we assume that the sampling points are i.i.d . randomly distributed variables , whose value is known to the sink node . note that this is a fair assumption , as one can think of sensor nodes randomly deployed over the geographical region that has to be monitored , or , even in the case where the network topology is intended to have a regular structure , the actual node deployment may turn out to be random due to obstacles or terrain asperities . in addition , now and then the sensors may enter a low - operational mode ( hence become inactive ) in order to save energy , and they may be loosely synchronized .",
    "all the above conditions yield a set of randomly distributed samples of the field under observation , in both the time and the space domain  @xcite . by truncating its fourier series expansion , a physical field defined over @xmath0 dimensions and with finite energy",
    "can be approximated in the region @xmath15 as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the approximate one - sided bandwidth ( per dimension ) of the field , @xmath18\\tran$ ] is a vector of integers , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "consider the matrix @xmath2 as defined in ( [ def : v_multifold ] ) and that the lmmse filter is used for field reconstruction . then",
    ", the estimate of the unknown vector @xmath27 in  ( [ eq : p ] ) , given @xmath67 and @xmath2 , is obtained by computing @xmath68 { \\mathbb{e}}[{{\\bf p}}{{\\bf p}}\\herm]^{-1 } { { \\bf p}}$ ] . through easy computations and using the sherman - morrison - woodbury identity , we can obtain the mse as @xmath69 = \\eta^{(n)}_{{{\\bf v}}{{\\bf v}}\\herm}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta_{n , m}}\\right ) \\label{eq : mse_n}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 denotes the signal - to - noise ratio on the sensor measurements , and we employed the definition of the @xmath4-transform given in  ( [ eq : eta - t ] ) .",
    "next , we approximate the mse of the finite size system in  ( [ eq : p ] ) through an asymptotic model , which assumes the size of @xmath2 to grow to infinity while the ratio of its number of rows to its number of columns tends to a finite limit , @xmath71 , greater than zero , i.e. , we assume @xmath72    indeed , in our recent works  @xcite it was shown that this asymptotic model provides a tight approximation of the mse of the finite size system , already for small values of @xmath17 and @xmath12 . under these conditions",

    "next , we observe that , in the case of massively dense networks where the number of sampling sensors is much larger than the number of harmonics considered in the approximated field , i.e. , @xmath152 , an interesting result holds :    [ cor1 ] let @xmath110 be the set where @xmath31 is strictly positive ; then @xmath153    the proof can be found in appendix  [ app : cor1 ] .",

    "it follows that the number of samples generated by the sensors network ( i.e. , the offered traffic load ) varies in the spatial domain .",
    "to represent such a scenario , we consider a wireless sensor network whose nodes are uniformly deployed over a square region .",
    "we also identify @xmath208 areas , @xmath209 @xmath210 , each corresponding to a different value of the offered traffic load .",
    "as often assumed in the literature ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) and widely applied in the practice , the network is divided into clusters and a hierarchy of clusters is created .",
    "more specifically , at the first hierarchical layer , layer 1 , the sensors are grouped into clusters , each of which is controlled by a cluster - head .",
    "the cluster - head is in charge of handling all traffic packets it receives from the nodes . at a given layer @xmath211 of the hierarchy",
    ", the cluster - heads are grouped into clusters on their turn and forward the traffic to their parent cluster - head . at the highest layer , layer @xmath212 , we have only one cluster whose cluster - head coincides with the sink node . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that the cluster at the @xmath212-th layer is composed of @xmath208 cluster - heads , each handling the traffic generated within one of the @xmath208 areas defined above .    as for the medium access control ( mac ) layer ,",
    "we consider that the nodes implement the ieee 802.15.4 standard specifications for wireless sensor networks  @xcite .",
    "in particular , all nodes within a cluster are in radio visibility of each other and use the slotted carrier - sense multiple - access / collision avoidance ( csma / ca ) technique  @xcite .",
    "this is a contention - based scheme and transmissions may fail if two or more sensors access the channel at the same time .",
    "inter - cluster interference is instead avoided by assigning different frequency channels to neighboring clusters .",
    "we consider that packets , whose transmission fails , are discarded .    in order to derive the probability that a packet transmission fails within a cluster due to collision , we use the markov chain model presented in  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath213 the average number of sensors belonging to the generic cluster at the @xmath214-th layer of the hierarchical architecture , in area @xmath209",
    "( @xmath210 and @xmath215 ) .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath216 as the average traffic load per node , again within the generic cluster at the @xmath214-th layer , in area @xmath209 . then , we set the size of the packet payload to 32  bytes , and the value of the other parameters as in  @xcite . under this setting , we compute the value of the collision probability within the generic cluster at layer @xmath214 , in area @xmath209 , as a function of @xmath213 and @xmath216 , i.e. , @xmath217  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe that at the generic layer @xmath214 , with @xmath218 , a node , which acts as cluster - head at layer @xmath219 in area @xmath209 , will have a traffic load equal to @xmath220 $ ] .",
    "it follows that the probability that a packet is successfully delivered to the corresponding @xmath214-layer cluster - head within area @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) can be obtained as @xmath221 .",
    "then , the probability that a measurement generated by a sensor located in @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) is successfully delivered to the sink is given by : @xmath222    next , denoting by @xmath223 the measure of @xmath209 , we define @xmath224 as the normalized probability that a message is successfully delivered to the sink . then , the spatial density of the sensors successfully sending their message is as follows : @xmath225 the density of @xmath169 is therefore given by @xmath226 and the asymptotic mse is given by @xmath227    ) and the case where all measurements successfully reach the sink ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the mse is shown as a function of @xmath71 and for different values of signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 ) . ]    ) and the case where all measurement transmissions are successful ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the mse is shown as @xmath71 varies and for different values of signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 ) . ]    figures  [ fig : lambda2 ] and [ fig : lambda1 ] show the impact of collisions due to the contention - based channel access , on the quality of the reconstructed field .",
    "in particular , they compare the mse of the reconstructed field when collisions are taken into account ( @xmath104 ) with the one obtained in the idealistic case where all messages ( measurements ) sent by the sensors successfully reach the sink ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the results refer to a square region of unitary side , where there are four areas of equal size ( @xmath238 , @xmath239 ) but corresponding to different resolution levels in the measurements collection ( i.e. , they are characterized by different traffic loads ) ; the number of hierarchical levels is set to @xmath228 .",
    "we set @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 in figure  [ fig : lambda2 ] , and a higher traffic load in figure  [ fig : lambda1 ] , i.e. , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 .    looking at the plots , we observe that both @xmath71 and @xmath62 have a significant impact of the obtained mse , with the mse increasing as @xmath71 grows and smaller values of @xmath62 are considered . most interestingly , by comparing the two figures",
    ", we can see that as the traffic load , hence the collision probability , increases , the performance derived taking into account the contention - based channel access significantly differs from the idealistic one .",
    "furthermore , the latter effect is particularly evident as @xmath62 increases , since the higher the signal - to - noise ratio , the more valuable the samples sent by the sensors toward the sink .",
    "we studied the performance of a wireless network whose nodes sense a multi - dimensional field and transfer their measurements to a sink node .",
    "as often happens in practical cases , we assumed the sensors to be randomly deployed over ( the whole or only a portion of ) the region of interest , and that their measurements may be lost due to fading or transmission collisions over the wireless channel .",
    "we modeled the sampling system through a multi - folded vandermonde matrix @xmath2 and , by using asymptotic analysis , we approximated the mse of the field , which the sink node reconstructs from the received sensor measurements with the @xmath4-transform of @xmath3 .",
    "our results clearly indicate that the percentage of region where sensors can not be deployed must be extremely small if an accurate field estimation has to be obtained .",
    "also , the effect of losses due to fading or transmission collisions can be greatly mitigated provided that a suitable value for the ratio between the number of harmonics approximating the field bandwidth and the number of sensors is selected .",
    "the @xmath79-th moment of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of @xmath3 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath240\\ ] ] where @xmath241 is the normalized matrix trace operator .",
