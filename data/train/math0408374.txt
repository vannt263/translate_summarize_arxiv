    "in 1973 , trotter @xcite found examples of knots that have isomorphic classical alexander modules , but non - isomorphic classical blanchfield linking forms .",
    "recently , t. cochran @xcite  defined higher - order alexander modules , @xmath1 , of a knot , @xmath2 , and higher - order linking forms , @xmath3 , which are linking forms defined on @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath4 , these invariants are just the classical alexander module and blanchfield linking form .",
    "the question was posed in @xcite whether trotter s result generalized to the higher - order invariants .",
    "we show that it does .",
    "the following is our main theorem .    for each @xmath5 , there exist knots @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 , but @xmath12 .    when @xmath13 , a particular example of the main theorem is the following pair of knots .",
    "the construction of them will be explained later in this paper .",
    "we shall work with classical , oriented knots in the pl category .",
    "we now review some notions of classical knot theory .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as knot theory resources .",
    "recall that by alexander duality , the @xmath14-th reduced homology of the exterior of the knot is trivial except when @xmath15 , in which case it is @xmath16 , generated by the meridian .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fundamental group of the exterior .",
    "hence , we can take the infinite cyclic cover of the exterior .",
    "the classical alexander module of a knot is defined to be the first homology of this infinite cyclic cover of the exterior of the knot , considered as a @xmath19 $ ] -module . here",
    "the module structure results from the action @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the meridian of the knot .",
    "furthermore , since the fundamental group of the infinite cyclic cover is the commutator subgroup , @xmath22 , it follows that the alexander module is simply @xmath23 considered as a right @xmath24 $ ] -module .",
    "a seifert surface for a knot , @xmath2 , is a connected , bicollared , compact surface in @xmath25 whose boundary is @xmath2 . for a choice of seifert surface , @xmath26 , and bicollar , the seifert form on @xmath27",
    "is defined to be the linking number of @xmath28 with @xmath29 , for any @xmath30 , where @xmath29 denotes a pushoff of @xmath31 in the positive direction of the bicollar of @xmath26 .",
    "a seifert matrix @xmath32 is the matrix representing the seifert form with respect to a choice of basis for @xmath33 . for any seifert matrix @xmath32 ,",

    "we define the blanchfield linking form of @xmath28 and @xmath31 to be @xmath43 ( mod @xmath44 $ ] ) , where @xmath45 is the ordinary intersection form .",

    ", we recall some results about the blanchfield linking form . c. kearton @xcite and h.f .",
    "trotter @xcite each proved the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath32 is a seifert matrix for a knot @xmath2 , then @xmath47 ^{-1}$ ] represents the blanchfield linking form for @xmath2 .",
    "recall that s - equivalence of matrices is the equivalence relation generated by integral congruence and column enlargements . here",
    "@xmath32 is integrally congruent to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an integral matrix with @xmath50 , and a column enlargement of @xmath32 is the following .",
    "@xmath51    here @xmath28 is an integer and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are column vectors .",
    "furthermore , two knots are s - equivalent if they have s - equivalent seifert matrices .    [ bl = seq]two knots have isomorphic blanchfield linking forms if and only if they are s - equivalent .",
    "the question arises : do there exist knots with isomorphic alexander modules , but non - isomorphic blanchfield forms ? by proposition [ bl = seq ] , it suffices to find examples of knots with isomorphic alexander modules that are not s - equivalent .",
    "furthermore , since the ordinary signature of a knot is an s - equivalence invariant , we have reduced the problem to finding two knots with isomorphic alexander modules , but with different signatures .    given any knot , @xmath2 , let @xmath54 denote the reverse of the mirror - image of @xmath2 .",
    "this is also the inverse of @xmath2 in the knot concordance group .",
    "if @xmath2 is a knot such that the ordinary signature of @xmath2 is non - zero , then @xmath55 and @xmath56 have isomorphic alexander modules , but non - isomorphic blanchfield linking forms .",
    "if @xmath32 is a seifert matrix for @xmath2 , then @xmath57 is a seifert matrix for its mirror - image , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a seifert matrix for its reverse , @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the seifert matrix for @xmath56 is @xmath61 . since @xmath62 and @xmath63 present isomorphic modules , @xmath2 and @xmath56 have isomorphic alexander modules .",
    "however , if the signature of @xmath2 is non - zero , then the signature of @xmath56 is not equal to the signature of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , @xmath2 and @xmath56 are not s - equivalent , and therefore have non - isomorphic blanchfield linking forms .",
    "we note that the examples that trotter provided in @xcite were found using different methods than those presented here .",
    "let us recall some of the definitions and results from @xcite and @xcite . given a knot @xmath2 ,",
