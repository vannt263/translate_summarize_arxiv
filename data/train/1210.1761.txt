    "as such , many different model have been developed , from scalar fields to modified theories of gravity that try to describe the early accelerated expansion of the universe that leads to the seeds of the universe we observe today ( cf . for example @xcite ) . in order to gain some insight on the dynamics of the early universe and to begin to discriminate between these models",
    ", one needs to probe the spectrum of the cosmological perturbations : for example the scalar or tensor perturbations , that arise from the quantum vacuum fluctuations during the inflationary period .",
    "in fact , since the evolution of these perturbations depends on the characteristics of the mechanism causing the acceleration of the universe , it is reasonable to assume that a given inflationary model will have some characteristic imprints on the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "another issue is that the inflationary paradigm does not solve the big bang singularity ; indeed it is expected that such a singularity would be resolved within the paradigm of quantum cosmology @xcite . a plausible candidate regarding",

    ", we propose a bouncing scenario within the context of modified theories in the metric formalism , more precisely we will consider an @xmath0 model .",
    "these kind of models have been quite popular recently as they could describe the current acceleration of the universe without invoking a dark energy component , i.e. the modification in the modified friedmann equation mimics the effects of a dark energy component with the advantage that the acceleration is a pure gravitational effect and is not due to an unknown dark energy component ( see for example refs .",

    "despite that the @xmath0 modifications can cause some conflict with observational constrains , ( e.g. solar system tests @xcite ) , a proper chameleonic mechanism was suggested in refs .",

    "more specifically , they found the right @xmath0 function that has to be considered to obtain a bouncing cosmology of the kind of lqc , providing for the first time the covariance of the theory through an effective action .",
    "our approach to a bouncing cosmology is different from the one proposed in  @xcite for the two following reasons : first we assume a metric formalism , second we choose a specific scale factor evolution .",
    "we essentially prefer the metric formalism to the palatini one in the present work because the cosmological perturbations are easier to handle on the metric formalism as compared with the palatini one . moreover , on the palatini @xmath0 formalism non - vacuum",
    "static spherically symmetric objects exhibit curvature singularities , casting doubt on whether palatini @xmath0 gravity can be considered as giving viable alternatives to gr as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the bounce we will consider in our model is followed by an inflationary era which is asymptotically de sitter where , in addition , the gravitational action approaches the einstein - hilbert action with an effective cosmological constant on that regime , such that the modification to einstein s general relativity ( gr ) affects exclusively the very early universe , around the bounce and a few e - folds after that .",
    "we will constrain the model obtaining the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational fossil as would be measured today .",
    "such an analysis will be carried out using a generalization for @xmath0-gravity of the method of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients first introduced in @xcite , and later applied in @xcite .",
    "one of these bogoliubov coefficients gives the density of gravitons of the universe .",
    "an alternative approach to obtain the spectrum of the gws in modified theories of gravity was developed in @xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "in this paper we introduce a phenomenological bounce in the early universe as a way to avoid the big bang singularity . a bounce at time @xmath2",
    "can be characterized in terms of the scale factor by : @xmath3    inspired on the de sitter solution for a closed friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time , we define the scale factor around the bounce as : @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the scale factor , @xmath6 is a constant quantifying the size of the universe at the bounce . in addition",

    "is a solution of the modified friedmann equation of a flrw universe with flat spatial section .",
    "this is a simple and straightforward way of modelling a bounce within the paradigm of modified theories of gravity .",
    "in addition , our choice is not only based on criterion of simplicity but also inspired on the fact that the above mentioned solution is asymptotically de sitter in the past and the future ( for space - times with flat spatial sections ) .",
    "consequently , this procedure assures avoiding the initial singularity and guarantees a period of inflation leading to the first seeds of the structures we see nowadays .",
    "also , the existence of such a bounce is prohibited for a flat space - time in gr unless exotic matter , which violates the null energy conditions , is invoked @xcite . in this paper , we work within the framework of @xmath0 theories of gravity which allow for a rich description of the universe ( see for example @xcite ) and as we will show this approach allows for the kind of bounces described by eq .  . for alternative approaches on bouncing cosmologies in modified theories of gravity cf .",

    "in fact from fig .  [",
    "fig : spectraaini ] it is possible to observe that if the condition is met the relation @xmath62 is heavily constrained : for @xmath215 the maximum of the potential is slightly above @xmath216 , while for @xmath217 the maximum of the potential is almost two orders of magnitude higher which clearly violates the cmb limit .",

    "we obtain @xmath230 in the high @xmath6 region ( see the asymptotic behaviour of fig .  [",

    "this , however , means that one would lose the ability to differentiate between the gr and the purely @xmath0 imprints on the spectrum , or , in the extreme case , lose the oscillatory structure altogether .    in fig .",

    "an estimation on the maximum amount of the allowed contraction without violating the cmb constraints was determined by studying the dependence of the height of the most intense peak of the spectrum on the parameters of the model .",
    "for an energy scale of @xmath229gev during the early inflation , we obtained @xmath236 .",
    "the fact that the contraction before the bounce his highly constrained may be viewed as an indication of the existence of an extra state of the universe that precedes the de sitter - like contraction .",
    "the potential imprint of such a hypothetical state on the gravitational waves spectrum is not studied in this work .",
    "furthermore , we note that the results obtained in this work are hard to be detected in the near future .",

    "finally , we point out that the solution obtained for @xmath0 is differentiable for all the values of @xmath1 but its second and higher derivatives blow up at the bounce .",
    "although this divergence does not have serious implications in the tensorial perturbations , it does imply that the scalaron @xcite becomes a tachyon near the bounce , so some problems are expected when studying the scalar sector . a way to overcome",
