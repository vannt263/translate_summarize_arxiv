    "<S> our analysis is a generalization of these works to the case with the soft - breaking terms . </S>",
    "<S> the results are qualitatively different from the previous works in the region of the large soft - breaking mass , where only one neutral higgs boson becomes light and the others are much heavier and decouple from the electroweak scale . </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath33 , the masses are controlled by the self - coupling constants , and thus the heavy higgs bosons do not decouple and the lightest cp - even higgs boson can have a different property from the sm higgs boson @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the conditions for validity of perturbation theory and the vacuum stability . </S>",
    "<S> for the first condition , we require that the running coupling constants of the higgs self - couplings and the yukawa couplings do not blow up below a certain energy scale @xmath1 ; @xmath34 for a renormalization scale @xmath35 less than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for the requirement of the vacuum stability , we assume that the quartic interaction terms in the potential do not give negative contribution for all directions of scaler fields at each energy scale up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition leads to @xmath36\\ , > \\ , 0 , \\label{stable}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we also require that the tree - level higgs potential at the weak scale does not have any global minimum except for the one we consider . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we assume that there is no cp nor charge breaking at the global minimum . and @xmath38 below @xmath37 in addition to ( [ stable ] ) in the model with @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of @xmath40 , our condition is essentially the same as that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , because we then have @xmath41 and @xmath42 at the electroweak scale from the positiveness of the squared - masses of @xmath43 and @xmath44 and we can show that these inequalities tend to be preserved at higher energy scale according to the 2hdm rge s . ] these conditions imposed on the coupling constants at a high energy region are transmitted into constraints on the coupling constants at the electroweak scale and then on the masses of higgs bosons .    in the decoupling case </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath32 , there can be a sizable correction on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass at a low energy scale . in order to include this effect , instead of calculating the @xmath45 s at the weak scale from the rge and using the tree - level mass formulas , we adopt the following procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the @xmath46 at the scale @xmath31 by using the 2hdm rge in the region between @xmath1 and @xmath31 , and then calculate the cp - even higgs boson mass according to the tree - level formulas . </S>",
    "<S> since the effective theory below @xmath47 is just the sm with one higgs doublet , we use the sm rge from @xmath47 to @xmath0 to evaluate the lightest higgs boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> although this procedure is not really justified for @xmath33 , we calculate the mass in this way because the correction from the sm rge is numerically very small in such case .    in our analysis , we use the 1-loop rge s for the sm and the 2hdm which are found , for example , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider the top - yukawa coupling contribution as the yukawa interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the running top mass is defined as @xmath48 and it is related to the pole mass @xmath49 by @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> there are important phenomenological constraints on the 2hdm . from the low - energy electroweak precision tests , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 parameter should be closed to unity , which means that the custodial @xmath52 symmetry should not be badly broken in the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the 2hdm contribution to the @xmath51 parameter according to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taking account of the experimental data up to 95% cl @xcite , we here set the condition @xmath53 for our analysis , where @xmath54 is the extra contribution of the 2hdm to the @xmath51 parameter paremeter . ] </S>",
    "<S> . another experimental constraint is obtained from the @xmath55 measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that there is very strong constraint on the charged - higgs boson mass from this process in the case of model ii , while model i is not strongly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the @xmath55 branching ratio with the next - to - leading order qcd correction  @xcite and use its constraint to determine the allowed region of the parameter space .    in the actual analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we first fix parameter sets of @xmath0 , @xmath56 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> since the higgs potential contains three masses and five coupling constants , the number of free parameters is four with fixing @xmath57 gev for each set of the parameter choice . </S>",
    "<S> we examine four - dimensional parameter space of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 under the experimental constraints above and obtain a maximum scale @xmath1 where one of the conditions ( [ blowup ] ) and ( [ stable ] ) is broken . </S>",
    "<S> we also put @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the top quark is fixed as 175 gev in our main analysis and later the dependence on @xmath49 is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the case of the decoupling regime ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the higgs bosons but @xmath3 are all heavy and their masses are almost degenerate around @xmath31 . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows that the contour plot of each @xmath1 ( @xmath64 gev ) for @xmath65 gev on the @xmath0-@xmath56 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath56 dependence is not so sensitive except for the small @xmath56 region where the top - yukawa coupling constant blows up at a low energy scale . for the smaller values of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath59 tends to become negative because of the negative effect of @xmath66-term in the rge for @xmath59 . on the other hand , for a large value of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 blows up at a low energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> there is no difference between model i and model ii in the decoupling regime , because the constraint from @xmath6 is not important in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative result may be understood by looking at the rge s . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h - mass-2hdm ] ) , @xmath67 is approximately given by @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and the rge for @xmath59 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> when we fix the coupling normalization by @xmath72 , the sm rge for @xmath73 is obtained by substituting @xmath73 and @xmath74 to @xmath59 and @xmath75 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam2-approx ] ) and neglecting the @xmath76 term in the rhs . </S>",
    "<S> thus the difference is only in the existence of the positive term @xmath76 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam2-approx ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this term works to improve the stability of vacuum to some extent , and the lower bound is expected to be reduced in the 2hdm .    </S>",
    "<S> next we see the case of the mixing regime ( @xmath77 gev @xmath78 ) , where the heavy higgs masses are realized only by the large @xmath46 s ( @xmath79 ) and their mixing . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the data from the low energy experiment strongly constrain the model . the contour plots for each @xmath1 on @xmath0-@xmath56 plane in model </S>",
    "<S> i and model ii are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can see in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) that there is an allowed region for @xmath4 gev in model i , while the largest @xmath1 is less than @xmath80 gev in model ii because the @xmath6 measurement gives a strong constraint for model ii 2hdm . </S>",
    "<S> note that the allowed region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) lies around @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) for large @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because that , in the region of @xmath83 , the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson @xmath3 comes from @xmath84 and the heavier higgs boson @xmath27 has the mass of @xmath85 . on the other hand , in the decoupling regime </S>",
    "<S> , the situation is reversed and the @xmath3 boson has the mass of @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> we repeated the above analysis for various values of @xmath31 and obtained the upper and lower bounds of the lightest cp - even higgs boson masses for various cut - off scales , which are shown in the contour plots in the @xmath0-@xmath31 plane in figs .  3 , ( a ) and ( b ) for model i and ii , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in fig  3(a ) , the qualitative behavior of the allowed region is understood from the above argument on the mass matrix . for the region of @xmath86 , the allowed region of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> lies around @xmath87 , and that becomes along @xmath88 and no longer depends on @xmath31 for @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> though there are the upper bounds of @xmath0 for each @xmath1 , @xmath0 is not bounded from below by our condition . </S>",
    "<S> our results at @xmath90 are consistent to those in @xcite . if we take account of the experimental result of @xmath6 , @xmath0 is bounded from below in the case of model ii as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) because the small @xmath31 region ( @xmath91 gev ) necessarily corresponds to the light charged higgs boson mass and is excluded by the @xmath6 constraint evaluation , the bound on the charged higgs boson or on the @xmath31 in model ii becomes rather smaller@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound of @xmath0 due to the @xmath6 constraint is then reduced by a few gev according to the change of the allowed region of @xmath31 . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the figure in which the results in the sm and the 2hdm ( model i and ii ) are combined on @xmath0-@xmath31 plane ( fig .  4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a reference , the upper and lower bounds of the lightest cp - even higgs mass in the mssm are also given for the case that the stop mass is 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are calculated by a similar method described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : namely we use the susy relation for higgs self - coupling constants at the 1 tev scale and use the 2hdm rge between 1 tev and @xmath31 , and the sm rge between @xmath31 and @xmath0 scale . in this figure , @xmath31 is the cp - odd higgs boson mass in the case of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to observe from this figure that the difference of the bounds among the sm , the 2hdm(i ) and the 2hdm(ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> we here choose , as an example , @xmath4 gev for the results in the sm and the 2hdm at @xmath5 gev . while the upper bounds in these models are all around 175 gev , the lower bounds are completely different ; about 145 gev in the sm , about 100 gev in the model ii and no bound in model i.    in order to see the top quark mass dependence of the above results , we have repeated the analysis for @xmath92 gev and @xmath93 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the lower bound has sizable dependence of the top mass whereas the upper bound does not change very much . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the lower line for @xmath4 gev in the 2hdm shown in fig .  4 shifts to lower ( upper ) by 9 gev for @xmath92 @xmath94 gev at @xmath65 gev , but the corresponding shift for the upper line is about 3 ( 4 ) gev . in table 1 , we list the @xmath49 dependence of the lightest cp - even higgs mass bounds for each value of @xmath1 in the sm and the 2hdm for @xmath65 gev and for @xmath95 gev ( model i ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on a question how much our results are improved if a higher order analysis is made in the effective potential method . in the sm , the next - to - leading order analysis of the effective potential shows that the lower bound reduces by about 10 gev ( @xmath4 gev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may be then expected that a similar reduction of the lower bound would occur in the 2hdm by doing such higher order analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the upper and the lower bounds of the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass in the 2hdm with a softly - broken discrete symmetry by requiring that the running coupling constants neither blow up nor fall down below @xmath1 . while the upper bound has been found to be almost the same as in sm , the lower bound turns out to be much reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in the decoupling regime , both model i and model ii give the lower bounds of about 100 gev for @xmath4 gev , which is lower by @xmath96 gev than the sm result . in this regime , the properties of the lightest higgs boson such as the production cross section and the decay branching ratios are almost the same as the sm higgs boson . in this letter , we have not explicitly considered constraint from the higgs boson search at lep ii , but if the higgs boson is discovered with the mass around @xmath97 gev at lep ii or tevatron experiment in near future and its property is quite similar to the sm higgs boson , the 2hdm with very high cut - off scale is another candidate of models which predict such light higgs boson along with the mssm and its extensions .    </S>",
