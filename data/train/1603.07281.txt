    "the robinson  trautman family of spacetimes contains nonsymmetric dynamical generalizations of several important solutions to the einstein field equations  e.g. , schwarzschild and vaydia solutions or the c - metric .",
    "notably , these solutions generally contain gravitational waves and offer the possibility to study the evolution of initial generic data towards a final stationary situation .",
    "this family is defined by the presence of a nontwisting , nonshearing , and expanding null geodesic congruence .",
    "recently , we presented a robinson ",
    "trautman solution minimally coupled to a free massless scalar field @xcite ( a broader overview of the standard robinson - trautman solutions with many references can be found there ) . in this case , it was not possible to use the original form of the robinson - trautman metric which admits only pure radiation and the maxwell field stress energy tensor aligned with the principal null direction or a cosmological constant .",
    "the reason was that the scalar field wave equation can not be satisfied for a scalar field whose gradient is aligned .",
    "the scalar field had to become non - aligned and the robinson ",
    "trautman metric had to be generalized to accommodate a broader class of energy - momentum tensors .",
    "complete classification of such geometries including general forms of the curvature tensors is shown in @xcite .    to help us with the interpretation of our solution we compute the bondi mass @xcite which is the most suitable description of the energy content of the spacetime for the robinson - trautman class and",
    "was used in this context previously ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the vacuum case computation by means of a conformal factor ) .",
    "we use the definition based on an asymptotic twistor equation adapted to a massless scalar field in @xcite .",
    "the computation confirms the expectation based on an asymptotic form of the solution .",
    "namely , the energy content of the spacetime is completely determined by a scalar field and there is no contribution of a schwarzschild - type `` mass '' .",
    "next , we show the specific subcases which are all spherically symmetric and we connect them with previously analyzed solutions .",
    "this brings a certain degree of justification for considering the whole class as physically relevant .    finally , inspired by a relation between a static subcase of our solution and a simple wormhole spacetime",
    "we analyze a wormhole version of the general robinson ",
    "trautman solution with a scalar field . unlike the original solution",
    ", the wormhole version naturally does not satisfy any energy conditions and thus is not very physical . on the other hand",
    ", it provides a dynamical wormhole which gets created and then disappears while having surprising asymptotic behavior which is connected to the kundt class .",
    "this family of solutions to the einstein equations is closely related to the robinson ",
    "trautman geometry and is defined by the presence of a nontwisting , nonshearing , but ( unlike robinson ",
    "trautman ) nonexpanding null geodesic congruence .",
    "most important members of this family are exact radiative spacetimes which generalize simple planar gravitational waves ( e.g. pp - waves ) .",
    "first , let us review the standard robinson  trautman solution for comparison and reference .    the vacuum robinson",
    " trautman spacetime ( possibly with a cosmological constant @xmath0 ) can be described by the line element @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 the metric generally contains two functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 might be set to a constant by suitable coordinate transformation @xcite and we consider this to be fulfilled for the coordinates of ( [ rtmetric ] ) .",
    "the einstein equations then reduce to a single nonlinear pde  the robinson  trautman equation @xmath7 these spacetimes are then generally of algebraic type ii .    as required by the definition of the robinson ",
    "trautman family the spacetime admits a geodesic , shearfree , twistfree and expanding null congruence generated by @xmath8 with @xmath9 being an affine parameter along this congruence , @xmath10  is a retarded time and @xmath11 hypersurfaces are null .",
    "spatial coordinates @xmath12 span a transversal 2-space which has the gaussian curvature ( for @xmath13 ) @xmath14 for general @xmath15 and @xmath11 , the gaussian curvature is @xmath16 so that , as @xmath17 , these 2-spaces become locally flat . as usual",
    "we will assume that the transversal 2-spaces are compact and connected which leads to a subclass that contains the schwarzschild solution ( considering vanishing cosmological constant for simplicity ) corresponding to @xmath18 ( consistent with a spherical symmetry ) .",
    "this subclass thus represents its generalization to a nonsymmetric dynamical situation .    for analysis of the robinson ",
    "trautman equation it is useful to introduce the following parametrization @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a function on a 2-sphere @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 ( such choice gives @xmath18 ) . by a rigorous analysis of the equation ( [ rteq ] ) together with the decomposition ( [ pfp0 ] )",
    "chruciel @xcite proved that , for an arbitrary , sufficiently smooth initial data @xmath23 on an initial hypersurface @xmath24 , the robinson ",
    "trautman type  ii vacuum spacetimes exist globally for all @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , they asymptotically converge to the schwarzschild(anti-)de  sitter metric with the corresponding mass @xmath26 and the cosmological constant @xmath0 as @xmath27 .",
    "this convergence is exponentially fast since @xmath20 behaves asymptotically as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are smooth functions of the spatial coordinates @xmath12 . for large retarded times",
    "@xmath10 , the function @xmath30 given by exponentially approaches @xmath31 which describes the corresponding spherically symmetric solution .",
    "there is a closely related family of exact solutions possessing a null congruence which is nonexpanding ( unlike in the case of robinson  trautman class ) , but still nontwisting and nonshearing  namely the kundt family @xcite .",
    "the general line element can be given in the form @xcite ( we use the same coordinate labels as in the robinson  trautman case to stress the similarities and differences ) @xmath32 with @xmath33 being functions of all the coordinates .",
    "note that the coordinate @xmath9 is absent from the transversal part of this metric which is given by the last two terms of ( [ kundt - metric ] ) ( compare with the robinson  trautman metric ( [ rtmetric ] ) ) .",
    "this directly leads to the privileged null congruence @xmath34 being nonexpanding . as we will see in the section [ wormhole ]",
    "this solution is closely related to an asymptotic state of the robinson ",
    "trautman geometry with an imaginary scalar field .",
    "the robinson  trautman solution generalized to accommodate a scalar field is given in the following form @xcite @xmath35 the scalar field is assumed to be a function of @xmath10 and @xmath9 only ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath9 means that the scalar field is not aligned ( with respect to the direction given by its gradient ) . from the einstein equations and the field equation for the scalar field @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is a standard dalembert operator for our metric ( [ ourmetric ] ) ) we obtained @xcite the following expressions for unknown metric functions and the scalar field @xmath39 with this constraint between the constants appearing above @xmath40    unlike the case of the vacuum robinson ",
    "trautman spacetime ( [ rtmetric ] ) one needs to solve three einstein equations with nontrivial right - hand side given by the stress energy tensor of the scalar field .",
    "the relation corresponding to the original robinson  trautman equation ( [ rteq ] ) is now transformed into @xmath41 one can recognize double laplacian in the last term on the left - hand side ( note the expression for @xmath42 in ( [ solution ] ) ) and the second term of ( [ rteq ] ) has its analog at the beginning of the second line of ( [ euu ] ) .",
    "the main reason for the difference between the vacuum ( [ rtmetric ] ) and the scalar field ( [ ourmetric ] ) case is an incompatible separation of variables for the metric function standing in front of the spatial part @xmath43 . in the vacuum case",
    "the dependence on coordinates is split into @xmath44 and @xmath45 while in the scalar field case it is @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "additionally , the scalar field case has more nontrivial einstein equations and also the scalar field equation to satisfy .",
    "this led to a solution which is more explicit rather than being left unintegrated as usual for the vacuum robinson ",
    "trautman metric where it is possible to prove the existence of a solution for the single robinson",
    " trautman pde ( [ rteq ] ) .",
    "although both the vacuum ( even with pure radiation ) and the scalar field robinson ",
    "trautman solutions are of algebraic type ii ( see appendix ) the ricci ( or segre ) type is different and most importantly the scalar field is not aligned with the principle direction @xmath48 of the weyl tensor .    in the previous study @xcite only a situation in which the constants @xmath49 satisfy @xmath50 was studied and the position of a curvature singularity and the existence of horizons was analyzed .",
    "namely , it was shown that the singularity seems initially naked and only later it gets covered by the horizon .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the metric was only hinted at in the original paper and since it shares its form with the special cases investigated later we will first derive the metric form when @xmath51 .",
    "to arrive at the asymptotic form of the general metric [ ourmetric ] when @xmath10 goes to infinity one first notes that @xmath52 for large values of @xmath10 when parameter @xmath53 is nonzero in the solution ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "combining functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 together @xmath56 it is easy to see that @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , noting that @xmath59 one can express another metric function in a familiar form @xmath60 collecting these pieces together we arrive at the metric @xmath61\\,\\d   u^2-\\,2\\,\\d u\\,\\d r\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{r^2}{\\mathcal{p}^2}\\,(\\d y^{2 } + \\d x^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exactly of the original robinson",
    " trautman form ( [ rtmetric ] ) when @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "so in the asymptotic region the generalized form of the robinson ",
    "trautman metric evolves into a standard one with vanishing mass parameter and without cosmological constant .",
    "such solutions belong to algebraic type n subclass of the original robinson  trautman spacetimes @xcite and contain ( apart from a trivial flat solution ) radiative solutions possessing singularity for certain values of @xmath12 on each wave - surface .",
    "these combine into singular lines in the spacetime . as noted in @xcite and repeated in appendix , the scalar field family of the robinson ",
    "trautman type does not contain these undesirable nontrivial type n solutions and therefore the final asymptotic state is just a flat spacetime ( consistent with the vanishing scalar field in the asymptotic region ) .",
    "the specific reason for the absence of type n solutions with singular lines is the separated form of @xmath30 ( [ p - separated ] ) which is the result of the selected form of the metric ( [ ourmetric ] ) .",
    "note , that the approach to the final asymptotic state differs from the vacuum case . in the vacuum case",
    "the behavior is described by a simple exponential ( [ rteq ] ) while for the scalar field case the exponential depends quadratically on the retarded time ( see ( [ p - separated ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) ) provided @xmath64 . in this case the solution with a scalar field can additionally be extended to a negative infinite retarded time unlike in the vacuum case where the evolution generally blows up due to the parabolic nature of ( [ rteq ] ) .",
    "there are many possibilities how to compute a `` mass '' characterizing a given spacetime and its content .",
    "the definitions are built in such a way that they give expected results in situations where the correct answer seems obvious , like for the schwarzschild solution with its mass parameter . when the spacetime geometry is suitable for a spacelike slicing the most natural one is either the adm mass @xcite ( asymptotic flatness is usually assumed for the construction ) or the komar mass @xcite ( suitable for stationary spacetimes ) .",
    "but because of the standard formulation of the initial conditions for the robinson - trautman class ( they are given on a null hypersurface ) and the ensuing evolution in the retarded time direction we use the concept best suited to such a situation  the bondi mass @xcite .",
    "first , let us transform the original metric ( [ ourmetric ] ) by the following change of variables ( inspired by @xcite ) and one redefinition of a function @xmath65 in terms of the new variables and the function @xmath66 the scalar field becomes @xmath67 ( note the similarity with the potential of a finite rod in prolate ellipsoidal coordinates ) and the metric simplifies into the following one @xmath68 which gives an easier interpretation for the special cases in the next section and is also suitable to investigate the global evolution of the energy content in our spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , the coordinate @xmath69 can not be integrated in a closed analytic form .",
    "now , we perform a conformal transformation of ( [ general form ] ) so that the corresponding unphysical metric can be extended to the future null infinity @xmath70 in a standard way .",
    "since the vector @xmath71 is normal to @xmath70 we select an appropriate conformal factor @xmath72 and introduce a new coordinate @xmath73 for convenience .",
    "the unphysical metric @xmath74 then reads @xmath75 the coordinates of this metric represent the asymptotic bondi coordinates near @xmath70 and the tetrad adapted to @xmath70 has the following form @xmath76    since our spacetime contains a free massless scalar field we have to use a generalization of the standard covariant formula for calculation of the bondi mass ( based on a twistor equation ) given in @xcite ( note the sign change due to a different signature convention ) @xmath77\\d s\\ .\\ ] ] in the above formula there appear the leading order terms of expansions of the standard newman ",
    "penrose quantities near the future null infinity .",
    "the integration is taken over a constant @xmath10 ( or equivalently constant @xmath69 ) spatial sections of @xmath70 . since our spacetime is shearfree the last term is identically zero while the first two combine to give @xmath78 the surface area in the last expression is a finite positive constant and by inspecting the explicit form of @xmath79 we can see that asymptotically the bondi mass smoothly decreases to zero .",
    "also , the bondi mass is completely given by the scalar field and is identically zero when the scalar field is switched off by putting @xmath80 .",
    "this confirms the previous result that our solution is related to the standard robinson - trautman geometry with vanishing mass parameter since otherwise the bondi mass would contain additional contribution proportional to this parameter @xcite .",
    "the natural interpretation of these results is that asymptotically the scalar field completely disappears being radiated away along @xmath71 .",
    "now we focus on special values of the parameters determining the general solution . specifically , we consider the simplified form of metric ( [ general form ] ) for the analysis .",
    "if we assume @xmath81 is zero @xmath82 it means that the scalar field vanishes and the condition for @xmath53 ( [ constraint ] ) ( if it should remain finite ) means that @xmath83 should approach zero as well which leads to @xmath84 .",
    "if we assume that the two - spaces spanned by @xmath12 are compact then the solution of the laplace equation is necessarily a constant ( the only harmonic functions on compact surfaces are constants ) . since we assume the two - spaces to be regular its gaussian curvature ( determined by @xmath85 ) should be positive . without loss of generality",
    "this constant can be chosen to be @xmath86 and we obtain a spherically symmetric situation , i.e. , @xmath87 where @xmath88 it is convenient to choose @xmath89 so the metric would be @xmath90 which is obviously a flat spacetime and all the components of the weyl spinor are zero .",
    "as shown in the section [ section - asymptotic ] the final state of the asymptotic evolution corresponds to a flat solution as well so the case of a vanishing scalar field just considered is the future attractor for the general solution in the class .      in this case",
    ", we have @xmath92 or in other words , as in the previous case , @xmath93 is a constant @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the metric functions @xmath55 and @xmath96 become ( note that now @xmath97 from ( [ constraint ] ) ) @xmath98 so the original metric can be written in the following form @xmath99\\,\\d u^2-\\,2\\,\\d u\\,\\d r + \\left (   ur^2-\\frac{c_{0}^2}{u}\\right)\\,\\d \\omega^{2},\\ ] ] and all the weyl scalars are zero except @xmath100 , @xmath101 using the set of coordinates of the line element ( [ general form ] ) the metric simplifies to this form @xmath102 and the scalar field is retained in the form ( [ scalar - trans ] ) with the function @xmath66 having a specific form derived below .",
    "since @xmath97 , it is possible to solve the integral defining @xmath69 in the transformation ( [ trans ] ) analytically , namely @xmath103 where we can fix the constant of integration @xmath104 by demanding @xmath105 to obtain @xmath106 now we can write @xmath55 explicitly in terms of @xmath69 @xmath107 this expression has moreover a reasonable limit for @xmath108 due to our choice of the constant @xmath104 . in terms of the new variables",
    "the scalar field becomes @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "the ricci scalar and the kretschmann invariant are giving the position of a curvature singularity @xmath111}{\\left [ c^2 \\rho^2-\\chi_{0}^2\\,(c-\\tilde{u})^2\\right]^2}\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( using a specific form of the solution ) @xmath112 obviously , the position given by the root of denominator changes linearly in @xmath69 .",
    "if one looks for an apparent or a trapping horizon possibly covering the singularity one arrives at the following equation for the horizon hypersurface ( derived from the condition for vanishing expansion of a congruence orthogonal to a spherically symmetric section of the horizon hypersurface ) @xmath113 for convenience it is possible to write @xmath66 in terms of @xmath69 , namely @xmath114 so [ horizon ] would be @xmath115 at the same time we know that the singularity is at @xmath116 using ( [ position - sing ] ) .    by a simple coordinate transformation the metric ( [ nml ] ) and the scalar field ( [ scalar - field - dss ] )",
    "can be shown to exactly correspond to the `` nonstatic spherically symmetric massless scalar field '' solution discussed by roberts @xcite .",
    "the presence of a horizon in this solution for certain values of parameters is briefly mentioned in @xcite where more general spherically symmetric scalar fields with nontrivial potentials are discussed .    introducing a reparametrization of the retarded time @xmath117 (",
    "notice the reversal of the time direction ) and an auxiliary parameter @xmath118 we can understand the relative positions of the singularity and the horizon by plotting them as in the figure [ plot ] . from the plot one sees that for the range of values @xmath119 the singularity is permanently naked while for the rest of the values the horizon is always present above the singularity for positive times @xmath120 .",
    "one can immediately recognize that the above time reversal corresponds to changing from the retarded to the advanced time .",
    "if one would not reverse the time orientation one would start ( for @xmath121 ) with singularity covered by a large horizon at negative time which would gradually shrink and merge with the singularity at time zero .",
    "note that now the original asymptotic value of @xmath122 translates according to ( [ u - transf - dss ] ) into @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "there we immediately obtain @xmath125 and the scalar field ( [ scalar - field - dss ] ) vanishes as well .",
    "interestingly , the bondi mass now becomes proportional to the horizon position which indicates that in this spherically symmetric and dynamical case the bondi mass ( completely generated by the scalar field ) plays the role similar to a variable mass in the vaidya spacetime @xcite in determining the horizon position .",
    "if we assume both @xmath53 and @xmath127 to be vanishing then @xmath79 becomes a constant @xmath128 and the whole geometry becomes obviously static and spherically symmetric . in this case the line element ( [ nml ] ) will simplify into @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "like in the previous case all the weyl scalars are zero except @xmath100 which becomes @xmath132 the scalar field is static as well @xmath133 the ricci scalar and the kretschmann invariant are @xmath134 @xmath135 one can easily see that the singularity is naked in this case , either directly from the metric ( [ static - metric ] ) or by looking for marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "the bondi mass is now vanishing which might seem surprising at first but it is exactly in accordance with the observation made in the previous case that related the bondi mass to the horizon position  now the horizon is absent .",
    "we can compare this static solution with the spherically symmetric static solution of janis , newmann and winicour @xcite in the coordinates given in @xcite @xmath136 in which @xmath137^{\\frac{1}{\\mu}}\\ ] ] and the scalar field is @xmath138 $ ] with the following relation between constants @xmath139 .",
    "one immediately sees that in the limit @xmath140 both the metric and the scalar field become identical ( up to a trivial introduction of a null coordinate ) to the static case given by ( [ static - metric ] ) and ( [ static - field ] ) .",
    "another connection to the previously studied spacetime can be found in the paper by morris and thorne @xcite studying traversable wormholes .",
    "namely , the toy model of a wormhole spacetime proposed there can be obtained from ( [ static - metric ] ) by a simple complex transformation of a constant @xmath141 .",
    "this evidently means that the curvature scalars , e.g. ( [ ricciscalar ] ) , do not diverge anywhere and such a spacetime avoids the region with singularity by possessing a sphere with minimal areal radius which is nonzero .",
    "the scalar field becomes purely imaginary @xmath142 so its stress energy tensor ( being quadratic in @xmath143 ) violates energy conditions as expected for a wormhole .",
    "note that we consider the change @xmath141 as a parametric transition in our original einstein - scalar field system of equations which means that we use the same definition for the stress energy of a scalar field as in @xcite , namely the standard stress energy of a real scalar field .",
    "of course the stress energy tensor of a true complex scalar field does not lead to such a violation of the energy conditions needed here .",
    "when @xmath144 the scalar field is still vanishing in this case .",
    "the metric ( [ static - metric ] ) is also evidently asymptotically flat .",
    "but the area of the spherical surfaces @xmath145 grows quadratically with the coordinate @xmath146 only far from the central region while close to the singularity @xmath147 it grows just linearly .",
    "inspired by morris and thorne @xcite traversable wormholes and the simple relationship between their wormhole and our static solution [ static - metric ] , we apply a complex transformation to appropriate constant @xmath148 in the general solution ( [ ourmetric ] ) .",
    "first , the scalar field becomes purely imaginary @xmath149 and the stress energy tensor ( being quadratic in @xmath143 ) violates all energy conditions .",
    "second , the metric functions change accordingly @xmath150 the metric sourced by a purely imaginary scalar field becomes @xmath151\\,\\d { u}^2-\\,2\\,\\d { u}\\,\\d r    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left(u\\,r^2+\\frac{c_{0}^2}{u}\\right)\\frac{(\\d x^2+\\d y^2)}{p(x , y)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ricci scalar is @xmath152 and the kretschmann invariant is again just its quadratic expression ( using the specific form of the solution ) @xmath112 this means that the curvature scalars do not diverge anywhere and curvature singularities are absent in this spacetime .",
    "if we compute the expansion of the congruence associated with the vector field @xmath34 @xmath153 we can see that by continuing the coordinate @xmath9 to negative values ( note that @xmath154 is now neither a curvature singularity nor a coordinate one ) we have a spacetime where the congruence @xmath34 changes sign at @xmath154 . on the surface @xmath155 ( which has a nonzero area )",
    "we not only have @xmath156 but also @xmath157 so it is a genuine wormhole throat satisfying the flare - out condition @xcite .    by looking at the figure [ fig2 ] one can recognize that the wormhole gets created only for a finite time close to the origin of coordinate @xmath9 . to show that this behavior is general ( if we consider @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) one can easily compute that the expansion ( [ expansion - r ] ) has two extremes ( a positive maximum and a negative minimum ) for @xmath160 and @xmath161 . combining this with the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath55",
    "( its explicit form ( [ imaginary - solution ] ) shows that it vanishes for both @xmath162 ) and the value of the expansion ( [ expansion - r ] ) for @xmath163 one immediately concludes that the throat structure analogous to that visualized in the figure [ fig2 ] is generic .",
    "the asymptotic form of the metric ( [ imag - metric ] ) when @xmath10 goes to either positive or negative infinity is ( note that now , unlike in the case of a real scalar field ( [ solution ] ) , the function @xmath55 asymptotically vanishes exponentially fast ( [ imaginary - solution ] ) ) , @xmath164\\,\\d { u}^2-\\,2\\,\\d { u}\\,\\d r+\\left(\\frac{c_{0}^2}{u\\,p^2}\\right)(\\d x^2+\\d y^2)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the scalar field [ imagi - scal ] becomes a constant @xmath165 .",
    "the absence of any dependence on the coordinate @xmath9 in the two - dimensional metric defined on the subspace spanned by @xmath12 evidently means that the expansion of the congruence associated with the principal null vector @xmath34 is vanishing .",
    "so this limiting form of geometry belongs to the kundt class ( compare with ( [ kundt - metric ] ) for vanishing @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) which is a nonexpanding counterpart of the robinson ",
    "trautman family .",
    "the wormhole solution given above thus has genuine robinson - trautman behavior for finite times but asymptotically ( @xmath162 ) transforms into a kundt geometry .",
    "specifically , it is related to a specific kundt geometry coupled to a scalar waves ( with @xmath63 ) discussed in @xcite .",
    "the covariant ( inverse trace ) energy momentum tensor and its trace are zero asymptotically while the weyl scalar @xmath168 and the ricci coefficient @xmath169 are nonzero .",
    "this behavior just means that certain tetrad projections are nonvanishing in the limit due to the behavior of the tetrad vectors ( or in other words the metric ) . on the other hand , inspecting the ricci scalar ( [ riccisc ] ) and the kretschmann scalar in the asymptotic limit one can see that the mentioned divergences do not occur as a result of a strong curvature singularity presence . nonzero @xmath168 and @xmath170 correspond to the kundt - type gravitational and scalar waves both for the negative and positive infinite values of @xmath10 ( see the form of the function @xmath55 ) .",

    "this important class of nonsymmetric and dynamical spacetimes was endowed with a scalar field source only recently . using the asymptotic form of the solution and the bondi mass we have shown that the scalar field is the only contribution to the energy of this solution and the energy content of the solution decreases to zero at the infinite retarded time .",
    "accordingly the geometry itself becomes flat asymptotically .",
    "we have compared the asymptotic behavior of the vacuum and the scalar field solutions .",
