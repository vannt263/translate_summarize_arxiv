    "galaxy number count measures the number density @xmath0 of galaxies per unit solid angle @xmath1 at redshift @xmath2 within the luminosity range @xmath3 $ ] as  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the luminosity function ( lf for short ) ; @xmath6 represents a specific direction on comoving coordinate with the corresponding differential volume @xmath7 .",
    "the anisotropic metric is encoded in the direction , while for isotropic and homogeneous frw metric , the relation between number density and lf is much simpler by integration over the solid angle and gives @xmath8 where @xmath9 , the dimensionless hubble parameter at redshift @xmath2 equals to @xmath10 and the luminosity distance is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "the dimensional constant parameters are absorbed by normalization factor in luminosity function , leaving dimensionless terms .",
    "the luminosity functions are usually measured in the non - parametric way by astrophysicist , but that approach is based on pre - selected fiducial modeling of background cosmological evolution .",
    "it is believed that variations in cosmological parameters are too weak to be captured through the noisy observation , but we are driven by the optimism that sooner or later we are able to detect them .",
    "luminosity function contains the intrinsic characteristic of different sets of galaxies , usually affected by redshifts , galaxy types and local environments . according to the assumption of the hierarchical structure formation with cold dark matter model , the most adopted analytical parameterization of luminosity function is the schechter form  @xcite which reads @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the characteristic luminosity and @xmath14 , the faint - end slope parameter .",
    "other well - known luminosity function forms are for example , the power - law model  @xcite : @xmath15 and log - gaussian model  @xcite : @xmath16dl.\\ ] ]    when @xmath17 , `` faint - end slope '' is a common feature of different luminosity functions . even though there are other luminosity functions which have no slope at faint limit , or through non - parametric method where luminosity function is not assumed to be a specific form , the faint slope is still available as a parametric approximation .",
    "so we generalize the luminosity functions at faint luminosity limit as : @xmath18 with @xmath14 and @xmath19 as constant parameters",
    ". the general form of luminosity function is convenient in discussing the cosmological effect as it will be shown in the following . with faint slope , the cosmological background effects in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) can be easily separated . at bright end , the number density can be significantly affected by gravitational lensing  @xcite , while background influence is suppressed by the rapid decrease of galaxy number .    from observation",
    "we capture the apparent magnitude of galaxies rather than absolute luminosity , where the cosmology is entangled with astrophysics .",
    "absolute magnitude relates to the apparent one mainly through luminosity distance and k - correction as follows @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the k - correction ; and the distance module @xmath22 , in which @xmath23 is the hubble free luminosity distance that reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) can then be expressed as @xmath26 by adopting @xmath27 .",
    "for simplicity , some constant parameters and values are absorbed in @xmath19 and @xmath14 parameterizations .",
    "now the effect of cosmology can be separated from astrophysics , that is the luminosity function , which means @xmath28 the number density then reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) can be integrated analytically , for predicting galaxy number within given range of apparent magnitude and redshift .",
    "we emphasize that this method must be limited within the faint - end of galaxy survey samples .",
    "the evolution of galaxy is also coupled with cosmological model normally , which will bring large uncertainty in estimating cosmological parameters through galaxy number count .",
    "in order to estimate the cosmological influence on galaxy number count at faint limit , we compare the consequent error in number density prediction of galaxy generated from variations in cosmological parameters , with respect to the fiducial @xmath31 model where @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "we define the comparison ratio @xmath33 which reads @xmath34 where @xmath0 indicates density prediction within the possible distribution range of cosmological parameters , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as well .",
    "the elements with subscript `` ( fid ) '' are calculated according to fiducial model .",
    "the parameters of luminosity function @xmath38 are set as the same since only cosmological effect is considered here , but inevitably , the `` faint - end - slope '' @xmath14 can not be removed , which has impact on the result .",
    "however , we roughly know about the range where the value of the slope lies from previous researches with samples observed at low redshift ( @xmath39 ) and intermediate redshift ( @xmath40 )  @xcite . in the following , we will display @xmath33 in different cases .    in the first case",
    ", we adopt the @xmath31 model and the variations come from the planck+wp+highl result  @xcite . the fiducial model is set with best - fit values of parameters , while the uncertainty in the estimations of parameters is taken to produce @xmath33 . following this setting , we have @xmath41 where by taking the @xmath42 limits of the variations of cosmological parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which means @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    [ fig1 ]",
    "derived according to uncertainties in cosmological parameters of @xmath31 model , the upper panel shows redshift dependency of estimation error with different faint - end slopes , while curves in the lower panel represent variation according to @xmath14 at fixed redshifts.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] +   derived according to uncertainties in cosmological parameters of @xmath31 model , the upper panel shows redshift dependency of estimation error with different faint - end slopes , while curves in the lower panel represent variation according to @xmath14 at fixed redshifts.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    as we can observe in fig.1 , estimation error of galaxy number density generally goes up with higher redshift and steeper faint - end slope , brought by the uncertainty of cosmology estimation with standard @xmath31 model according to cmb observations .",
    "recently , some research papers suggest the possible deviation from standard @xmath47cdm model  @xcite , which mainly comes from comparison and combination of low - redshift and intermediate - redshift observations .",
    "union@xmath48 data analysis  @xcite suggests that @xmath49 at @xmath42 limit for @xmath47cdm model , and @xmath50 was estimated in ref .",
    "the result in parameter - frame @xmath51 given by sne ia observations is truly inconsistent with those estimated according to cmb observations at @xmath52 level .",
    "notice that physically meaningful parameter - set should be @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is estimated to be @xmath55 from planck s report , while to be @xmath56 from union@xmath48 with @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , the inconsistency is relieved to be @xmath42 level after changing the parameter - frame in the same parameter space .",
    "this is reasonable , as @xmath54 represents the quantity of physical dust matter density while @xmath58 in the same frame represents physical density of total energy in the flat base @xmath47cdm model ; meanwhile , in the @xmath51 frame , @xmath59 indicates the contrast of matter density against total energy density , which means @xmath59 is much more sensitive to matter - to - field transition than @xmath54 .    without convincing conclusion about cosmology deviation from standard @xmath47cdm model @xcite",
    ", we can also address the coupling between non - standard cosmology and galaxy density evolution , which reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents possible fraction of galaxy density evolution ( assumed to be a power - law form ) caused by cosmological influence , the cosmological quantity with tilde overhead comes from prediction with non - standard model , while the ones without represent standard predictions .",
    "notice that the right - hand - side of the above equation is exactly what we had defined in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , so the coupling is about power - law parameterization of @xmath62 , which reads then    @xmath63",
    "in this short letter , we briefly observed the influence from cosmology on predicting galaxy number densities .",
    "the observational uncertainty in @xmath47cdm model has negligible effect at low redshift but the uncertainty may raise over 5 percent at redshift higher than @xmath64 .",
    "we also evaluated the effect in a model independent way , with low redshift observational datasets .",
    "the relative difference against fiducial @xmath47cdm model is about @xmath65 to @xmath66 percent . in current work",
    ", we have not included the coupling issue between cosmology and galaxy evolution into discussion , which lies beyond this article . from the latest planck results @xcite the @xmath67 value and",
    "fluctuation amplitude tensions still exist , which may imply we need new physics beyond the base @xmath47cdm model if the current results hold up and further observations enhance so .",
    "we hope the quantifying of cosmological influence on galaxy number count based on current observation is helpful in more robust estimation of galaxy evolution and the corresponding cosmology study in the near future . with the upcoming accuracy datasets besides the planck s , ska s and sdss s we optimistically believe with sufficient confidence that this kind of work is full of positive effects on the precise cosmology research with very promising future .",
