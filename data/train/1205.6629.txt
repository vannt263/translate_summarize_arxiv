    "electrons are described by the dirac equation where the u(1 ) maxwell electromagnetic field ( emf ) @xmath0 is coupled to the charge current @xmath1 as described by the lagrangian ( in the natural unit where @xmath2 ; @xmath3 )  @xcite @xmath4 \\psi.\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the covariant derivative , @xmath6 is the electron mass .",
    "note that the spin is encoded by 4 component nature of the spinors @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the @xmath9 gamma matrices @xmath10 , but the charge and charge current alone determine the electromagnetic properties of the electrons , which are given by @xmath11    in condensed matter physics , on the other hand , the low energy phenomena compared with the mass gap @xmath12 are considered , and only the positive energy states described by the two - component spinor are relevant .",
    "then , the relativistic spin - orbit interaction originates when the negative energy states ( positron stats ) are projected out to derive the effective hamiltonian or lagrangian .",
    "the projection to a subspace of the hilbert space leads to the nontrivial geometrical structure which is often described by the gauge theory .",
    "this is also the case for the dirac equation , and the resultant gauge field is su(2 ) non - abelian gauge field corresponding to the zeeman effect ( time - component ) and the spin - orbit interaction ( spatial components ) as described below .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the positive energy states can be derived by the expansion with respect to @xmath13  @xcite @xmath14 \\psi , \\label{eq : lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is now the two - component spinor and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xmath17 are the gauge covariant derivatives with @xmath18 being the quantity proportional to the bohr magneton  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is the maxwell emf , and the su(2 ) gauge potential are defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the pauli matrices .",
    "the su(2 ) gauge field is coupled to the 4-component spin current @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] namely , the zeeman coupling and the spin - orbit interaction can be regarded as the gauge coupling between the 4-spin current and the su(2 ) gauge potential .",
    "( the spin current is the tensor quantity with one suffix for the direction of the spin polarization while the other for the direction of the flow . )",
    "note that the system has no su(2 ) gauge symmetry since the `` vector potential '' @xmath22 is given by the physical field strength @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. , the relation @xmath25 automatically holds .",
    "this fact is connected to the absence of the conservation law for the spin density and spin current density in the presence of the relativistic spin - orbit interaction . in the spherically symmetric systems , the total angular momentum , i.e.",
    ", the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta , is conserved , but the rotational symmetry is usually broken by the periodic or disorder potential @xmath26 in condensed matter systems .",
    "therefore , it is usually assumed that the conservation law of spin is lost by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "however , it is noted that the spin and spin current densities are `` covariantly '' conserved as described by the `` continuity equation ''  @xcite @xmath27 replacing the usual derivative @xmath28 by the covariant derivative @xmath29 .",
    "this suggest that the conservation law holds in the co - moving frame , but the crucial issue is how to translate this law to the laboratory frame , which is the issue addressed in this paper . note again that the su(2 ) gauge symmetry is absent in the present problem , and hence the lagrangian like @xmath30 , which usually leads to the generalized maxwell equation and also to the conservation law of 4 spin current including both the matter field and gauge field  @xcite , is missing . instead",
    ", we will regard @xmath22 as the frozen background gauge field , and focus on the quantum dynamics of noninteracting electrons only .    in this paper , we derive the hidden conservation law by defining the `` twisted '' spin and spin current densities which satisfy the continuity equation with the usual derivative @xmath28 .",
    "the description is intended to be pedagogical and self - contained . for this purpose ,",
    "the theoretical techniques developed in high energy physics is useful .",
    "the essential idea is to take into account the effect of the background gauge field in terms of the noncommutative geometry generalizing the concept of `` product '' .",
    "this is achieved by extending the usual lie algebra to hopf algebra .",
    "usually , a conservation law is derived from symmetry of an action , i.e. , noether s theorem .",
    "the symmetry in the noncommutative geometry is called as a `` twisted '' symmetry , and this symmetry and the corresponding generalized noether s theorem have been studied in the high energy physics .",
    "seiberg and witten proposed that an equivalence of a certain string theory and a certain field theory in noncommutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "since then , the noncommutative geometry have been attracted many researchers . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the poincare symmetry is broken in a field theory on a noncommutative geometry .",
    "it is a serious problem because the energy and momentum can not be defined .",
    "m. chaichian , _ et al_. proposed the twisted symmetry in the minkowski spacetime , and alleged that the twisted poincare symmetry is substituted for the poincare symmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover , g. amelino - camelia , _ et al_. discussed noether s theorem in the noncommutative geometry  @xcite .    as we will discuss in detail later , a certain type of a noncommutative geometry space is equal to a spin - orbit coupled system",
    ". therefore , a global su(2 ) gauge symmetry in the noncommutative geometry space gives a noether current corresponding to the `` twisted '' spin and spin current in the spin - orbit coupling system .",
    "this enables us to derive the generalized noether s theorem for the twisted spin and spin current densities .",
    "now some remarks about the application is in order .",
    "spintronics is an emerging field of electronics where the role of charge and charge current are replaced by the spin and spin current aiming at the low energy cost functions  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic spin - orbit interaction plays the key role there since it enables the manipulation of spins by the electric field .",
    "however , this very spin - orbit interaction introduces the spin relaxation which destroys the spin information in sharp contrast to the case of charge where the information is protected by the conservation law .",
    "therefore , it has been believed that the spintronics is possible in a short time - scale or the small size devices .",
    "the discovery of the conservation law of twisted spin and spin current densities means that the quantum information of spin is preserved by this hidden conservation law , and could be recovered .",
    "actually , it has been recently predicted that the adiabatic change in the spin - orbit interaction leads to the recovery of the spin moment called spin - orbit echo  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conservation law of the twisted spin and spin current densities is directly related to the applications in spintronics .",
    "the plan of this paper follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : flow ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : noether ] , we review the conventional noether s theorem , and describe briefly its generalization to motivate the use of hopf algebra and deformation quantization . in section [ sec : hopf ] , the hopf algebra is introduced , and section [ sec : star ] gives the explanation of the deformation quantization with the star product . the gauge interaction is compactly taken into account in the definition of the star product .",
    "these two sections are sort of short review for the self - containedness and do not contain any original results except the derivation of the star product with gauge interaction .",
    "section [ section : ts ] is the main body of this paper . by combining the hopf algebra and the deformation quantization , we present the derivation of the conserved twisted spin and spin current densities .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] is a brief summary of the paper and contains the possible new directions for future studies .",
    "the readers familiar with the noncommutative geometry and deformation quantization can skip sections [ sec : hopf ] , [ sec : star ] , and directly go to section [ section : ts ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss noether s theorem  @xcite , and its generalization as a motivation to introduce the hopf algebra and deformation quantization . in section [ subsec :",
    "con ] , we will recall noether theorem , and rewrite it using the so - called `` coproduct '' , which is an element of the hopf algebra . in section [ subsec : general ] , we will sketch a derivation of generalized noether theorem .",
    "we start with the action @xmath31 given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents a range of the spacetime coordinate @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) with a dimension dim , i.e. , @xmath36 is the dimension of the space , @xmath37 describes a lagrangian density , and @xmath38 @xmath39 represents light speed .",
    "we introduce a field @xmath40 with internal degree of freedom @xmath41 , and infinitesimal transformations : @xmath42 where we characterize the transformations by the subscript ; specifically , @xmath43 represents a general infinitesimal transformation .",

    "in this section , we will derive the twisted spin density , which corresponds to the spin density in commutative spacetime without the background su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "first , we will derive a general form of the twisted spin current in section [ subsec : dtsws ] , which is written by using the twisted variation operator .",
    "this operator is constituted of the coproduct and twisted element ; the coproduct reflects the action rule of the global su(2 ) gauge symmetry generator , and the twisted element represents gauge structure of the background gauge fields .    in section [ sub : rdm ] , at first , we will calculate the twisted spin density of the so - called rashba - dresselhaus model in the wigner representation using the general form of the twisted spin density , and next , we will find the twisted spin operator in real spacetime using correspondence between operators in commutative spacetime and noncommutative phasespace .      the lagrangian density in the wigner space is given by @xmath888 where @xmath6 is the electric mass , @xmath889 for any functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the variation corresponding to the infinitesimal global su(2 ) gauge transformation is defined as @xmath890 where @xmath548 represents an infinitesimal parameter .",
    "therefore , the variation of the lagrangian density @xmath891 is given by @xmath892 here we introduce the grassmann numbers @xmath893 ( @xmath894 ) , the product @xmath123 , and the coproduct @xmath895 , where the coproduct satisfies @xmath896 for any functions @xmath113 and operator @xmath186 .",

    "for instance ,",
    "@xmath912 ; it corresponds to the following calculation : @xmath913    the variation ( [ eq : dl2 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath914    if we replace @xmath915 with @xmath916 in equation ( [ eq : dl3 ] ) , the integrals in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath259 of the right - hand side of eq .",

    "because @xmath920 , we can write @xmath921 in the case that the infinitesimal parameter depends on the spacetime coordinate , this equation can be written as @xmath922 therefore , we obtain the twisted noether current @xmath923    in particular , the twisted spin @xmath924 is conserved quantity . here , we assumed that the su(2 ) gauge is static one .",
    "however , we do not use this condition in the derivation of the twisted noether charge and current density .",

    ", we discuss the adiabaticity of the twisted spin . in the case that su(2 ) gauge fields have time dependence , the twisted spin is not conserved .",
    "now , we assume that @xmath929 ( @xmath830 ) with constant fields @xmath930 ; @xmath931 is an adequate slowly function dependent on time .",

    ". therefore we obtain @xmath936 this means that @xmath934 is the adiabatic invariance .",
    "namely , for the infinitely slow change in @xmath931 during the time period @xmath937 , @xmath934 remains constant while @xmath938 is finite .",
    "this fact is essential for the spin - orbit echo proposed in @xcite .",
    "here we apply the formalism developed so far to an explicit model , i.e. , the so - called rashba - dresselhaus model given by @xmath939 with a potential @xmath940 , where @xmath342 and @xmath343 are the rashba and dresselhaus parameters , respectively . completing square in terms of @xmath941",

    "we remark about the limit of validity of this conservation law .",
    "first , we neglected the dynamics of the electromagnetic field @xmath0 which leads to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "this leads to the inelastic electron scattering , which is not included in the present analysis , and most likely gives rise to the spin relaxation .",

    "this situation is analogous to the two relaxation times @xmath979 and @xmath980 in spin echo in nmr and esr .",
    "namely , the phase relaxation time @xmath980 is usually much shorter than the energy relaxation time @xmath979 , and the spin echo is possible for @xmath981 .",
    "similar story applies to spin - orbit echo  @xcite where the recovery of the spin moment is possible only within the inelastic lifetime of the spins .",
