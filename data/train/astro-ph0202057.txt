    "as sensitivity has improved , many galaxies fainter than the natural sky brightness have been discovered .",
    "it has now become clear that the central disk surface brightness of spiral galaxies does not fall within a narrow range of @xmath5(0)=21.65@xmath60.30 mag arcsec@xmath7 as originally proposed by @xcite and that , at a given circular velocity , there is a very wide range of observed @xmath5(0 ) . as a candidate repository of abundant baryonic mass in the universe and a significant link in the unsolved evolutionary paths of galaxies , low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb , hereafter )",
    "have become a relatively new subject of study in extragalactic astronomy ( bothun et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "since the distribution in surface brightness is continuous , there is no obvious definition for a low surface brightness galaxy , but , practically , many surveys define a low surface brightness system as a galaxy with a disk central surface brightness @xmath8 mag arcsec@xmath7 , a value roughly equal to the brightness of the night sky background in the regime between 4000 and 5000   on a moonless night at a good astronomical observing site @xcite . although several catalogs contained significant numbers of diffuse galaxies before the 1970s , the lsbs in those catalogs were limited to low mass galaxies and were not representative of the full range of lsb types .",
    "the discovery of lsb galaxies advanced considerably in the 1980s @xcite . to date ( oneil et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) , three main classes of lsb galaxies have been identified : ( 1 ) dwarfs , defined by objects with scale lengths @xmath91 kpc ; ( 2 ) disk galaxies with scale lengths 1@xmath105 kpc and circular velocities in the range 80 - 200 km s@xmath1 ; and ( 3 ) giant disk galaxies with scale lengths @xmath115 kpc .",
    "dwarf lsbs include both irregular ( di ) and more regular spiral ( ds ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "dwarf lsb galaxies have much in common with blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) : a large amount of hi , often with small ob associations , and blue colors ( @xmath120.5 mag ) .",
    "but dwarf irregulars are distinguished from bcds by having amorphous shapes , as well as by having star - forming regions that are not centrally concentrated .",
    "also , dwarf lsbs are known to have higher total masses ( within a given surface brightness ) and larger linear diameters than bcds @xcite . meanwhile , normal - size or giant lsbs are more similar to late - type spiral galaxies in their general properties , except in overall low stellar density .",
    "they have normal or rich hi contents with @xmath13/@xmath14@xmath151.5 @xcite but the average hi surface densities are 6@xmath1610@xmath17 cm@xmath7 which is below the threshold for star formation @xcite ; co emission is seldom detected in these systems @xcite . in a recent work by @xcite , only 6 out of 28 lsb galaxies observed at mm wavelength have been detected in co. the integrated @xmath19 colors are known to be unusually blue without large , bright star - forming regions @xcite but giant lsb spirals are redder than smaller lsb galaxies with a trend of redder color with increasing @xcite .",
    "even though it is believed that giant lsbs may have evolutionary histories distinct from other lsbs @xcite , most of the lsb galaxies are thought to be quiescent , unevolved and gas - rich systems @xcite .",
    "to explain localized star formation without global star formation in the lsb galaxies , sporadic star formation episodes and a slow evolutionary rate scenario  has been suggested @xcite . if the lsb galaxies evolve much slower than their high surface brightness counterparts , these systems must form less stars in a hubble time and will thus have a higher total mass - to - light ( @xmath20 ) ratio .",
    "for this reason , many groups have been studying the @xmath20 ratio and the gas content of lsb galaxies to understand how the star formation history and evolutionary state of these systems differ from those of high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the luminosity - hi linewidth plane , first constructed by @xcite , indirectly contains information about the variance in global @xmath20 for disk galaxies . in simple dynamical terms ,",
    "a small scatter about the tf relation can be understood if disk galaxies a ) obey the virial theorem , b ) have constant @xmath20 and c ) have constant @xmath5(0 ) .",
    "the mystery , of course , in the tf relation is that conditions b and c are demonstrably false .",
    "the recognition that the potentials of disk galaxies are dark matter dominated makes the existence of the tf relation very difficult to understand from first principles because , apparently , it requires that the amount of luminosity trace the dark matter in a way that scales exactly with @xmath21 .",
    "this fine tuning requires that the baryonic mass fraction in disk galaxy potentials be nearly constant , which should be a troubling point as it implies that just enough baryonic gas creeps into these dark potentials and then has the correct star formation history to produce the right amount of light for a given @xmath21 . in order for lsb disk galaxies to therefore comply with the tf relation requires an additional fine tuning between @xmath5(0 ) and @xmath20 must occur in such a way that higher @xmath20 potentials ( e.g. those with a reduced baryonic mass fraction ) still produce the correct amount of light for a given @xmath21 .",
    "this apparent physical paradox strongly suggests that lsb galaxies which deviate from the observed tf relation must exist .",
    "thus , searches have been conducted for any strong discrepancies from the tf relation among lsb galaxies in order to see whether or not there exists such a conspiracy , and how it could affect the star formation histories of either lsbs or normal spiral galaxies . recently",
    ", @xcite found six apparently extreme systems in their hi survey using arecibo , which appear to strongly deviate from the tf relation thus opening up the manifold of disk galaxy properties .",
    "this potentially important result was highlighted by @xcite , but , unfortunately , as demonstrated in this paper , that result is an artifact of a much larger than anticpated side - lobe problem associated with the reconfiguration of the arecibo focussing system and the subsequent change in illumination pattern on the dish .",
    "the sample of @xcite contains a more diverse lsb population in terms of color and size than other samples . in 1997 , oneil , bothun and cornell @xcite conducted a comprehensive survey of lsb galaxies in order to obtain structural parameters such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , etc .",
    "and colors ( johnson / cousins @xmath25 , when possible ) in the cancer and pegasus galaxy clusters ( hearafter obc ) using the university of texas macdonald observatory 0.8 m telescope . in total 127 galaxies were found with @xmath2622.0 mag arcsec@xmath7 including 119 newly identified lsb systems .",
    "the colors of these galaxies range continuously from very blue ( @xmath27=0.56 , @xmath19=0.37 ) to very red ( @xmath280.8 ; note that galaxies of s0a or earlier types have this @xmath19 value in general - see figure 5 of @xcite ) , which indicates that lsb galaxies at the present epoch define a wide range of evolutionary states @xcite .",
    "also , the obc catalog includes many small galaxies with scale lengths less than 1 kpc .",
    "since the redshifts were not known , the conversion from arcsec to kpc was based on an average distance either to the cluster ( pegasus or cancer ) or to the primary galaxy in the image @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite conducted an hi survey of galaxies from the obc catalog using the refurbished 305 m arecibo gregorian telescope , and detected hi emission from 43 galaxies out of the 111 lsbs in the 2000 - 12000 km s@xmath1 range .",
    "the detected galaxies cover a similar range of properties as hsb galaxies , ranging from very blue through very red ( @xmath19=-0.7 - 1.7 ) and from extremely gas rich through gas poor ( @xmath29/@xmath14=0.1 - 50 @xmath30 ) . with the determined line widths and absolute magnitudes ,",
    "the authors find that only 40% of the hi detected lsb galaxies fall within 1@xmath0 of the standard high surface brightness galaxy tf relation .",
    "in addition , they find six extreme outliers ( see fig .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath20 ratios of some lsb galaxies are much higher than the values needed to compensate for low surface brightness . in order to determine the @xmath20 more accurately and to study the detailed hi properties such as the hi distribution , the isophotal ( hi ) size , the local kinematics , rotation curves , and @xmath31/@xmath32 , it is required to get hi synthesis images and in this paper we investigate the galaxies most discrepant from the tf relation found by @xcite .",
    "we obtained images with the vla of four of the 43 galaxies detected in hi by @xcite - three out of the six extreme non - tf galaxies and one galaxy which deviates from the tf relation by 2@xmath0 , using the vla in the 3 km c - short configuration . the observations in the vla , however , show that some of the arecibo results are contaminated by bright galaxies , due to a significantly larger sidelobe compared to what was believed at the time of observation .",
    "in this paper , we present the results of the vla observations . in ",
    "[ obs ] , we summarize the observations and data reduction . in",
    "  [ result ] , we present and discuss the hi properties of the galaxies which we have found in the field . finally , in   [ discuss ] ,",
    "we compare the hi global profiles of the bright galaxies ( contaminators ) to the hi spectra of the lsbs obtained by @xcite to illustrate the degree of confusion in the arecibo hi survey caused by the extended sidelobe . in light of this",
    ", this paper then corrects the results of @xcite and removes some of the observed tf discrepancy thus maintaining the mystery of how it is that lsb disk galaxies can populate a similar tf locus as high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the hi imaging was done in june 2000 with the vla in the 3 km c - short configuration .",
    "we observed three out of the six extreme departures from the tf ( p01 - 3 , c06 - 1 , c04 - 1 ) and c04 - 2 which is located at the 2@xmath0 upper limit of the tf relation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the 21-cm linewidths ( at the 50% level ) determined by @xcite for these sample galaxies are 375 , 333 , 410 and 85 km s@xmath1 , with peak flux densities of 9 , 8 , 9 and 6 mjy @xcite . from the known velocity widths ,",
    "the bandwidth was chosen as 6.25 ( for p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 ) and 3.125 ( for c04 - 1 and c04 - 2 ) mhz .",
    "the data were obtained with 2 polarizations ( 2ac correlator mode ) and 63 channels .",
    "the field of view is set by the 25 m diameter of the individual array elements .",
    "we integrated 8 hours per galaxy resulting in a 2@xmath0 column density sensitivity of 5.6 and 4.8@xmath1610@xmath33 cm@xmath7 per channel ( @xmath34=20.6 km s@xmath1 ) for p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 , respectively , 2.6 and 3.2@xmath1610@xmath33 cm@xmath7 per channel ( @xmath34=10.3 km s@xmath1 ) for c04 - 2 and c04 - 2 , respectively .",
    "instrumental parameters and resulting sensitivities are listed in table 1 .",
    "standard vla calibration procedures were applied in aips .",
    "the continuum was subtracted by making a linear fit to the visibility data for a range of line - free channels in both sides of the band .",
    "we chose line - free channels based on the hi spectra of @xcite .",
    "two of the observations ( p01 - 3 and c04 - 1 ) were seriously affected by solar interference . for these we first subtracted a model of the continuum image from the @xmath35 data , and then clipped @xmath35 data above 2 jy for each datacube . to make the images we applied a weighting scheme intermediate between uniform and natural but closer to a natural weighting scheme to maximize sensitivity .",
    "in our vla observations of the lsb galaxies , we detect five galaxies in total ( including two lsbs : ugc 12535 ( p01 - 1 ) and c04 - 2 , from the four hi datacubes centered on the lsb galaxies . in the field of p01 - 3 , we detect three galaxies , -ngc 7631 , kug 2318 + 078 and ugc 12535-but not p01 - 3 .",
    "ugc 12535 is in fact the same as the lsb galaxy p01 - 1 in the obc catalog .",
    "likewise , in the field of c06 - 1 , ngc 2595 was detected instead of the lsb galaxy , c06 - 1 .",
    "in fact , the hi profiles of p01 - 2 , p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 of @xcite are consistent with those of kug 2318 + 078 , ngc 7631 and ngc 2595 , respectively which implies that the hi survey of @xcite must have been contaminated by bright neighbors .",
    "the details will be discussed in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "we do not see any hi from c04 - 1 which appears to be the only isolated lsb deviating significantly from the tf relation ( fig.1 and fig .",
    "below , we present the hi properties and hi maps of the galaxies which we detect from the vla run ( jun , 2000 ) . the extended hi properties are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the hi mass is calculated using @xmath36 , where the distance @xmath37 in mpc and the integrated hi emissivity @xmath38 is in jy km s@xmath1 .",
    "we assume @xmath4 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 in this work .",
    "the hi linewidths , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were measured in three different ways : at 20% and 50% of ( 1 ) the highest peak ; ( 2 ) two different peaks of each side of the systemic velocity ; ( 3 ) the average of those two peaks .",
    "the differences are not larger than 10 km s@xmath1 and the linewidths determined by the second method are given in the table .",
    "the smallest hi mass that can be detected in a datacube at the position of the lsb is a 4@xmath0 signal per beam per channel .",
    "the upper limit to the hi mass is @xmath41m@xmath42 , if the lsb s are within the velocity range probed . since we now no longer have a detection of these galaxies , we do not know their redshifts and they may lie outside the observed velocity range .",
    "we detect hi from two lsb galaxies , ugc 12535 ( fig .",
    "3 ) and c04 - 2 ( fig .",
    "ugc 12535 is found in the field of p01 - 3 and is also known as p01 - 1 in the obc catalog .",
    "ugc 12535 was also in the original cluster spiral sample of @xcite who failed to detect it in 21-cm and noted that it had an ususually low value of @xmath43 for its classification as a normal - sized late - type lsb galaxy with @xmath4417.5 kpc ( assuming @xmath45=75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "these new observations show that ugc 12535 is less than 2@xmath0 from tf relation with the corrected hi linewith , @xmath46=174 km s@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "our hi mass of ugc 12535 implies an @xmath43 of 0.15 which is indeed very low . this is a relatively red lsb disk with observed color of @xmath19 = 0.82 ( see both oneil et al .",
    "1997a and bothun et al .",
    "1985 ) and thus represents a rare case of a lsb disk with relatively low gas content which may indeed be the faded evolutionary remains of a former hsb spiral , of which there are currently many in the pegasus i cluster ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another hi detected lsb galaxy is c04 - 2 .",
    "c04 - 2 is one of the newly identified lsbs in @xcite s ccd survey for lsb galaxies .",
    "however , in @xcite , the scale length of c04 - 2 is not available since they did not provide information for galaxies with king profiles or galaxies which have such irregular surface brightness profiles that they are unsuitable for a linear fit . but",
    "considering its apparent size ( d@xmath47 ) and radial velocity ( @xmath48 km s@xmath1 ) , the physical size ( diameter ) of c04 - 2 is about 7.4 kpc and it must be either of the first or second class . the hi profile of c04 - 2 is consistent with the hi spectrum of @xcite . since the size of c04 - 2 is comparable to the beamsize itself , we could not derive the rotation .",
    "c04 - 2 is also one of the very red lsbs with @xmath19=1.33 and deviates from the tf by 2@xmath0 in the direction of smaller @xmath20 .",
    "the star formation history of lsb disk galaxies has generally been hard to understand , mostly because of the bulk of these disk galaxies are very blue but with very low current star formation rates .",
    "the simplest traditional scenario , that lsb disks are the faded remnants of hsb disks and thus represent an advanced state of disk galaxy evolution , has long been ruled out by the fact that the lsb disk is very blue and gas rich in general . this study has now produced a good candidate in ugc 12535 as a faded hsb disk .",
    "( in addition , the decontaminated red lsbs now remain as such with no known velocity .",
    "if they are indeed cluster members , as seems likely given their angular size , then they too may comprise additional examples of red lsb disks that are gas poor ) . on the other hand , c04 - 2",
    "is very red yet has relatively high gas content which straightforwardly shows that red lsb galaxies are not necessarily gas - poor , a result consistent with @xcite .",
    "thus , like their blue counterparts , red lsb disks are unlikely to be in the same evolutionary state at the present time .",
    "ngc 7631 ( fig .",
    "5 ) is found in the field of p01 - 3 with a radial velocity of 3746 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we see its rotation curve declining ( on both sides ) .",
    "the rotation velocity of 200 km s@xmath1 decreases between 17 kpc and 20 kpc , beyond r@xmath49 ( @xmath1513.7 kpc ) , by 15@xmath65.7 km s@xmath1 ( @xmath507% of the maximum rotation velocity ) . previously , @xcite studied spiral galaxies which have declining rotation curves and find falling curves are more dominant in bright , compact galaxies and rising curves are more frequently found in low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "they conclude that the decrease in rotational velocity indicates a large ratio of luminous to dark mass in luminous regions of the systems , which suggests that the compactness of a galaxy is a measure of the initial spin parameter .",
    "we see a declining rotation curve from another bright , compact galaxy , kug 2318 + 078 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , found in the field of p01 - 3 with 3886 km s@xmath1 . kug 2318 + 078 has remarkably asymmetric kinematics and the decrease of the rotational velocity is found only in one side . in the approaching side , the rotational velocity reaches at its maximum velocity , 125.0@xmath61.8 km s@xmath1 at a radius between 7 and 8 kpc , then drops by @xmath5021% to 98.6@xmath66.0 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "the hi profile is consistent with the hi spectrum of p01 - 2 ( fig .",
    "8) obtained at arecibo . kug 2318",
    "+ 078 seems to be located outside of the arecibo main beam ( fig .",
    "9 ) , but it must have affected p01 - 2 within the first sidelobe .",
    "the details will be discussed in the last section .    in the field of c06 - 1 ,",
    "ngc 2595 ( fig .",
    "7 ) is found at a distance of 2.9 arcmin from c06 - 1 with a radial velocity of 4214 km s@xmath1 .",
    "ngc 2595 has well defined spiral arms and a flat rotation curve with the maximum velocity of 325@xmath617 km s@xmath1 .",
    "ngc 7631 and ngc 2595 fall into the middle of the standard tf , while kug 2318 + 078 is located between 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 to the direction of over luminous for a given linewidth ( fig .",
    "through vla synthesis imaging ( 2000 ) , we fail to detect hi from any of the lsb galaxies which were thought by @xcite to deviate significantly from the tf relation . instead , we find that the hi profiles of ngc 7631 and ngc 2595 are consistent in velocity range and amplitude with p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 observed by @xcite using the arecibo telescope ( using the corrections found by @xcite ) .",
    "the bright galaxies , ngc 7631 and ngc 2595 are located at 2.6 and 2.9 arcmin from p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hi profiles of p01 - 3 and c06 - 1 must have been contaminated by those bright companions . similarly , we find that the hi profile of p01 - 2 of @xcite is consistent with that of kug 2318 + 078 which is 2.9 arcminute away ( see fig . 8) . in none of these cases ,",
    "the bright contaminators were expected to seriously affect the signal of the lsb galaxies in the center considering the beamsize of the arecibo at 1420 mhz ( 3.1@xmath163.5 in az@xmath16za ) .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite shows that the first sidelobe extends to @xmath50 10 arcmin diameter and if we take this into account , the hi survey by @xcite could have been seriously contaminated . as an attempt to save face , we point out that , at the time of the original observations ( scheduled to be the first extragalactic post upgrade arecibo observations ) @xcite would not have even undertaken these observations had they known that the post upgrade beam now contains a sidelobe which is effectively 3 times the beam size ! clearly that produced some anamolous results , which scientifically were interesting and lead to the vla follow - up observations which then showed how severe the contamination really was .",
    "indeed , five out of the six lsb galaxies which were thought to deviate significantly from the tf relation @xcite have bright companions within the first sidelobe of arecibo ( fig . 10 ) . besides p01 - 3 ,",
    "c06 - 1 , and p01 - 2 , two other extreme non - tf lsb galaxies , c05 - 5 and c08 - 3 , must have also been affected by the bright , nearby galaxies ugc 4416 and ugc 4308 . in table 3 , we present the list of lsb galaxies and their possible contaminators with coordinates and radial velocities .",
    "note , however , that unlike most of the lsb galaxies which have bright neighbors , p01 - 4 does not seem to be contaminated , even though p01 - 4 has a bright neighbor , ngc 7631 , at a distance of 3.4 arcmin and it falls within the distance the beam to the sidelobe .",
    "it implies that the first sidelobe might be asymmetric , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we investigated the fields of the 43 hi detected lsb galaxies in @xcite s sample . excluding the five galaxies which turned out to be contaminated by bright galaxies , the rest of the hi - detected lsb galaxies are safely isolated within the first sidelobe of the arecibo .    from this work , we conclude that we do not see any evidence of strong deviation from the tf relation for the lsb sample of @xcite .",
    "even though many groups have been working on this subject , there is still no agreement if there exists any fine tuning between central surface brightness and the total mass - to - light ratio that makes disk galaxies follow the tf relation .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite find that the lsb galaxies follow the same tf relation defined by normal spiral while @xcite and @xcite find a curvature ( underluminous at a given line width ) at the low luminosity end of the tf for lsb galaxies .",
    "these contradictory results may partly be due to selection effects . as @xcite point out , the star formation history and evolutionary states of lsb galaxies studied using the tf relation gives different interpretations strongly depending on the sample galaxies .",
    "for example , investigators who studied comparable to or larger than normal - sized galaxies conclude that lsb galaxies do follow the same tf relation @xcite , while others who included smaller lsbs find larger scatter in the tf @xcite . here we have a good sample ( obc catalog , 1997 ) which is diverse in terms of sizes and colors and in fact , we see a larger scatter even if we exclude the contaminated lsbs .    in fig .",
    "11 , we present the tf relation of @xcite s lsbs excluding the contaminated lsbs at @xmath51-band .",
    "indeed @xmath51-band tf relations are often known to suffer from star formation activities or internal extinction .",
    "however , the ratio of surface brightness of the galaxy to the sky background steadily decreases as one goes to longer wavelength .",
    "therefore , the s / n of low surface brightness systems at longer wavelength such as @xmath52-band is lower than at @xmath51-band , which still makes us rely on @xmath51-band tf relation the most rather than tf relations at any other longer wavelengths for low surface brightness galaxies ( see fig . 12 ) .",
    "hence , here we discuss about the tf relation of @xcite s lsbs only at @xmath51-band through fig .",
    "we see a larger scatter at the low luminosity end but this is typical of most tf samples ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find , @xmath53=-(6.57@xmath60.96)log@xmath54 - 3.84@xmath61.91 with 38 lsb galaxies which is close to the tf relation obtained by @xcite ( @xmath53=-6.59log@xmath54 - 3.73@xmath60.77 from 42 sample galaxies ) but gives a larger scatter .",
    "much of this scatter at the low luminosity end can be attributed to inclination error and/or significant non - circular motions that contributed to the observed linewidth .",
    "what is therefore more relevant is that we see significant scatter at higher linewidths ( e.g. @xmath55 100 km s@xmath1 ) and this is almost surely reflecting the intrinsic variation in global @xmath20 among disk galaxies of varying @xmath5(0 ) .    in this figure , lsbs are also plotted by color ; very blue ( @xmath560.6 ) , intermediate color ( 0.6@xmath570.8 ) and very red ( @xmath280.8 ) . here",
    "we find a weak trend of scatter by colors ; blue lsbs seem to have higher @xmath20 ( as @xcite or @xcite find ) , while no preferential direction is seen for red lsbs in their scatter .",
    "in fact , the obc catalog contains many red small lsbs compared to previous lsb studies and from some of the red lsb samples , we find an opposite trend of the curvature which @xcite or @xcite found .",
    "however , the integrated color in this plot is drawn using @xmath19 only and it requires further study .",
    "we learn the following from the tf of the lsb galaxies in the obc catalog @xcite : ( 1 ) the curvature predicted and found by @xcite & @xcite is marginally found only for the blue lsb galaxies ; ( 2 ) unlike blue ( @xmath58 ) lsbs , very red ( @xmath59 ) lsb galaxies do not show any preferential direction in deviating from the standard tf ; ( 3 ) a weak correlation between gas richness and the deviation from the tf , is found in agreement with the findings by @xcite .",
    "this broadening of the tf relation , as found in this study , is consistent with moving away from selection effect dominated systems and towards a more representative sample of disk galaxies .",

    "<S> we present very large array ( vla ) hi imaging of four low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( [ obc97 ] p01 - 3 , [ obc97 ] c06 - 1 , [ obc97 ] c04 - 1 , [ obc97 ] c04 - 2 ) will be omitted hereafter . ] which were thought to strongly deviate from the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation based on arecibo single - dish observations . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect three of the four targeted lsb galaxies in hi down to a 4@xmath0 limit of 0.08jy km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that two of the four of these lsbs have bright galaxies at projected distances of 2.6 and 2.9 arcminutes , which have contaminated the arecibo signal . </S>",
    "<S> a further examination of the arecibo sample shows that five out of the six galaxies that were found to deviate from tf have nearby bright galaxies ( within 3.5 arcmin and within the observed hi velocity range ) , and we conclude that possibly all but one of the non - tf galaxies are contaminated by hi from nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sixth galaxy was not detected by us . </S>",
    "<S> a new observation by arecibo did not confirm the earlier detection . </S>",
    "<S> we present the hi properties , kinematics , and rotation curves of three bright galaxies ngc 7631 , kug 2318 + 078 , ngc 2595 which happened to be in the lsb fields and of two lsb galaxies , one of the targeted ones c04 - 2 and one ( ugc 12535 or p01 - 1 ) that was found in the field of p01 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two detected lsb galaxies fall within 2@xmath0 on the tf relation . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated profiles of the bright galaxies are consistent with the arecibo results both in velocity range and amplitude , which indicates that most of the extreme deviators from the tf relation must have been affected by bright companions in this earlier hi survey . </S>",
    "<S> a more recent determination of the sidelobe structure of the arecibo beam supports our conclusion and shows that the degree of sidelobe contamination was much larger than could have been initially predicted . </S>",
    "<S> if the now unknown velocities of these non detected lsb s are within our probed velocity range then the limit to their hi mass is roughly 10@xmath2 @xmath3 assuming @xmath4 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have corrected the results found in @xcite and have reconstructed the tf relation . </S>",
    "<S> these new observations then show a ) a reconstructed tf relation that has relatively large scatter at all values of rotational velocity ( possibly indicating the true range in disk galaxy properties ) and b ) the presence of at least some red , gas poor , lsb disks that indeed may be in an advanced evolutionary state as the faded remnants of their former high surface brightness actively star forming state . </S>"
