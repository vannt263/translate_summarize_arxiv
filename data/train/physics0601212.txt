    "due to the large number of free charge carriers at the temperatures and densities considered , thermal bremsstrahlung emission , resulting from inelastic free - free scattering , contributes significantly to the emission background .",
    "therefore , experimental conditions such as scattering angles , spectral properties of the probe and the detector have to be chosen as to obtain a maximum signal - to - background ratio .",
    "_ background _ is to be understood as bremsstrahlung radiation , whereas _ signal _ corresponds to the photons having undergone thomson scattering .",
    "so far , classical formulas for the bremsstrahlung emission level going back to kramers @xcite have been used to determine threshold intensities of the external source to overcome the background due to bremsstrahlung @xcite .",

    "corrections to kramers formula for bremsstrahlung are described by the so - called gaunt factor @xcite . in the simplest approach",
    "it is obtained by taking into account collisions between electrons and fixed ions in born approximation .",
    "in dense plasmas , many - particle effects as dynamical screening become important .",

    "furthermore we compare thomson and bremsstrahlung photon yield over a finite spectral range . thereby , and by taking improved expressions for the bremsstrahlung cross section , we show , that even higher thresholds have to be reached in order to obtain a thomson signal above the bremsstrahlung level at least near the plasmon resonances .",
    "these peaks are much lower than the central peak being essentially an ion feature .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in the first section we review the basic physics of thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung and how they can be expressed in terms of the dynamic structure factor and the dielectric function , respectively . since these two quantities are related to each other via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , we are able to describe both processes on a common and consistent basis .",
    "we then compare the emission level due to bremsstrahlung to the thomson signal whose strength is proportional to the flux of incoming photons , i.e. the power density of the external source .",
    "thereby , we find expressions for the threshold power density as a function of particle density and temperature . in the last section",
    "we discuss our results for various sets of experimental parameters relevant for future experiments at the vuv - fel .",
    "the central quantity of interest is the spectral power density @xmath15 , i.e. the rate of energy radiated per unit scattering volume @xmath16 , wavelength @xmath17 , and solid angle @xmath18 .",
    "the total spectral power density is the sum of the corresponding quantity for every radiative process in the plasma . in this work we focus on thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung , i.e. @xmath19 to unambiguously identify the thomson signal ,",
    "we require that the thomson power density is at least equal to the bremsstrahlung level , @xmath20 the thomson spectrum is given by the intensity of the probe laser @xmath21 , and the thomson scattering cross section @xmath22 . to account for the finite spetral bandwidth of the detector , one has to convolute each power spectrum with a detector function @xmath23 . in practice",
    ", this is only relevant for the thomson signal since the bremsstrahlung spectrum is slowly varying in the relevant frequency region .",
    "the thomson power spectrum reads @xmath24    we have introduced the response function @xmath25 , where the bar denotes the convolution with the detector function .",

    "also , due to the short pulselength of the vuv - fel ( 20 - 120 fs ) , we neglect the heating of the plasma due to the probe beam .",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectrum does solely depend on the plasma parameters density and temperature , so that , with a suitable formula for the bremsstrahlung spectrum , which we will abbreviate by the notation @xmath26 in the following , eq .  ( [ eqn : thresh_cond ] ) defines a threshold intensity @xmath27 we will now briefly describe how expressions for the thomson scattering and the bremsstrahlung spectrum can be obtained from a common starting point , i.e. the dielectric function of the plasma .",
    "the cross section for thomson scattering in a plasma can be given in terms of the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) , @xmath28 : @xmath29 see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the variables @xmath30 are related to the transferred linear momentum and energy , respectively , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are incoming and outgoing linear momenta of the laser field , respectively .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : thoms_skw ] ) shows that plasma collective properties can be measured in a thomson scattering experiment .",
    "however , this requires an accurate theory of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "the dynamic structure factor @xmath28 is closely related to the longitudinal dielectric function by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath39 this relation can be utilized by applying an appropriate approximation to the dielectric function . due to the mass ratio @xmath40 , thomson scattering on ions can be neglected .",

    "radiative free - free transitions of electrons , known as bremsstrahlung , represent the main source of emission in a hot , fully ionized plasma .",
    "however , the bremsstrahlung process requires the presence of a scattering partner that carries the recoil momentum .",
    "kinematically , emission by electrons which scatter on ions is dominant .    for a thermally equilibrated plasma , emission , characterized by the spectral power density @xmath42 , and the absorption coefficient @xmath43 as the relative attenuation of the intensity of electromagnetic waves propagating in the medium per unit length ,",

    "note that we consider the long wavelength limit , thus the wavevector @xmath46 does not show up as an argument of the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath47 .",
    "the absorption coefficient can be obtained from the imaginary part of the transverse dielectric function according to @xmath48 where the index of refraction @xmath49 is also linked to the transverse dielectric function by @xmath50 in the long wavelength limit , the longitudinal dielectric function , which appears in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( [ eqn : fdt_eps ] ) , and the transverse dielectric function coincide @xcite .",
    "thus , relations ( [ eqn : fdt_eps ] ) and ( [ eqn : alpha_eps ] ) enable us to treat both thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung on a common basis , namely by using an appropriate theory for the longitudinal dielectric function .",
    "the aim of this work is to compare both radiation processes , thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung , calculated in a consistent approximation .",
    "the comparison has to be carried out between the contributions of either process in leading order of density .",
    "bremsstrahlung occurs in second order of the coupling constant @xmath51 as can be seen from the transition amplitude @xmath52 expressed by feynman diagrams , @xmath53 giving the bethe - heitler cross section , see ref .",
    "the transition amplitude involves a longitudinal field ( coulomb field ) i.e. a scattering partner , say an ion of effective charge @xmath54 .",
    "thus , bremsstrahlung is naturally of second order in density .",
    "a free electron does not emit bremsstrahlung , unless collisions take place .",
    "the challenge is then to accuratly describe the scattering process itself .",
    "born approximation , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : transampl_feyn ] ) does not describe the correct behaviour of the bremsstrahlung spectrum in the case of collisions involving high transfer momenta , so - called strong scatterings .",
    "these can be included by ladder - summation of all one - photon exchange processes , which leads to the t - matrix .",
    "thereby , the electron - ion interaction is treated accuratly in all orders . in the coulomb limit ,",
    "one finds sommerfeld s expression for bremsstrahlung , see eq .",

    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . in our calculations",
    "we will use sommerfeld s formula eq .",
    "( [ eqn : somm1 ] ) . since we are interested in the bremsstrahlung spectrum at high frequencies , i.e. in the vicinity of the fel frequency ( @xmath55 ) , no screening effects are considered here .",
    "note that the use of the t - matrix does not increase the order in density , instead , it gives the accurate gaunt factor in leading order of density .",
    "further many - particle effects like self - energy and vertex corrections lead to higher order contributions in density and , therefore , are not considered here . for a consistent treatment of the self - energy of the scattering electron , given by multiple scattering on ions and its impact on the bremsstrahlung spectrum , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of thomson scattering ,",
    "we adopt the same strategy : we calculate the contribution from lowest order in density .",
    "unlike bremsstrahlung , already the first order in density gives a finite contribution .",
    "the amplitude for thomson scattering in second order of the interaction @xmath56 does not contain any longitudinal field and therefore behaves regularly over the whole spectral range .",
    "thus , the dsf , which describes the thomson scattering in the medium , is taken in random phase approximation ( rpa ) that accounts for the dynamical screening .",
    "this is all the more important , as the thomson scattering cross section is evaluated in the vicinity of the plasma frequency where dynamical screening is the dominant effect @xcite .",
    "collisions are neglected , since they occur in the next to leading order in density .    to conclude",
    ", a consistent comparison between thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung in media asks for the cross section of either process in leading order in density .",
    "this consideration leads us to the rpa for the dynamic structure factor , and a t - matrix ladder summation for the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung can be determined by the longitudinal dielectric function @xmath57 .",
    "we will now briefly outline how the longitudinal dielectric function can be obtained in the framework of linear response theory .",
