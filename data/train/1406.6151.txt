    "most natural and industrial solids have rough surfaces , with roughness that is close to self - affine and fractal , and spanning several orders of magnitude in spatial scale .",
    "persson theory  @xcite has been shown to describe the contact mechanics of such surfaces quite well .",
    "it has been extended to also describe various other properties and phenomena , such as adhesion  @xcite , plasticity  @xcite , contact stiffness  @xcite , leakage  @xcite , squeeze - out  @xcite , and mixed lubrication  @xcite .",
    "persson theory builds on quite simple and elegant statistical premises about how the pressure distribution @xmath3 changes as the `` magnification '' @xmath4 is increased , i.e. , sinusoidal roughness is gradually and systematically added to an initially flat , semi - infinite surface in contact with a counter body . in its original formulation  @xcite ,",
    "the only input into the theory are experimentally measurable quantities , in particular the power spectrum of the surface roughness , the effective modulus , and the external load . in recent works",
    "@xcite , a `` fudge parameter '' of order unity is introduced .",
    "its purpose is to make the theory reflect more accurately the relation between displacement and elastic energy when contact is partial .",
    "while persson theory has been tested numerous times and shown to describe many interfacial properties quite accurately , only the final results of the theory have been under scrutiny .",
    "so far , no quantitative analyses have been reported in the literature to what extent the assumptions entering the theory hold and to what degree ( fortuitous ) cancellation of errors may be responsible for its success",
    ". manners and greenwood  @xcite raise some concerns , mainly with regards to the boundary conditions employed , but fail to investigate to what measure the assumptions influence the results .",
    "this paper quantitatively investigates the main underlying assumptions of persson theory , and quantifies the error each assumption introduces .",
    "we do this with high - resolution numerical simulations using the gfmd method  @xcite .",
    "there are no adjustable parameters besides those characterizing the rough surface and the ratio of pressure and elastic modulus .",
    "the assumptions of an ideally - elastic , semi - infinite half - plane are shared by persson theory .",
    "we can test each assumption entering the theory individually and assess its effect , which may provide guidelines as to how to correct the theory in the future .",
    "the approach pursued in this work is to solve numerically the contact mechanics problem by sequentially increasing the magnification . during each step of including more small - scale details into the simulation",
    ", we measure the detailed evolution of the system , e.g. , we compute the transition probability @xmath5 .",
    "it states the likelihood that the pressure at a given interface point in real space changes from @xmath6 to @xmath1 as the magnification is increased from @xmath4 to @xmath7 .",
    "another central observable is how the elastic energy is distributed among different modes ( in fourier space ) as @xmath4 changes .",
    "these results are then compared to pertinent expressions in persson theory .",
    "analysis of individual modes provides additional information beyond previous tests of the theory that only analyzed integrated properties , for example relative contact area  @xcite , the mean gap  @xcite , the contact stiffness as a function of the applied pressure  @xcite , adhesion  @xcite , or the correlation functions of contact and pressure  @xcite .",
    "this work is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : methods ] we summarize key ingredients of persson theory , including its main assumptions we set out to test as well as the numerical methods we use .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the results of our tests .",
    "we discuss our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the key ingredients of persson theory and the numerical methods we use .",
    "many controlled approximations enter both persson theory and the numerical solutions in a similar fashion .",
    "thus , our analysis only pertains to the accuracy of the solution of the idealized contact mechanics model and not to the accuracy of the idealizations themselves .",
    "the idealizations used in this work are : the small - slope approximation , neglect of lateral displacements , linear elasticity , semi - infinite bodies , hard - wall interactions , and absence of adhesion , although the latter can be added to both theory and simulations  @xcite . in addition , we assume self - affine surface spectra , whose height profiles can be characterized as colored noise .",
    "the statistical properties of our idealized surfaces are defined by their hurst exponent @xmath8 , cutoff ( or roll - off ) wave numbers limiting the power law behavior at large and small wavelengths , respectively , and a prefactor  @xcite . as pointed out recently in a dimensional analysis  @xcite , systems with a cut - off at large and small wavelengths",
    " which we consider here  are fully defined by a small set of dimensionless numbers : ( i ) a dimensionless pressure @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dimensional pressure , @xmath11 the effective modulus , and @xmath12 the root - mean - square gradient of the surface , ( ii ) the hurst exponent @xmath8 , and ( iii ) the ratio of the two cut - offs at short and long wavelengths , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , one may consider ( iv ) the ratio of system size @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which , however , is only relevant at very small loads  @xcite , and    ( v ) , in numerical simulations , the ratio of lattice discretization @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which we try to keep small enough to approach the continuum limit sufficiently well .",
    "the contact mechanics theory by persson has been summarized several times  @xcite , also in a previous work  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on its details related to the assumptions we are going to verify .",
    "assume we know the pressure distribution in a contact , whose spatial features are resolved up to a magnification of @xmath4 , i.e. , the spectrum of the surfaces is limited to wavevectors magnitudes @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "we could predict how the distribution changes with increasing @xmath4 if we knew the transition probability @xmath5 , which , as stated in the introduction , specifies the likelihood that the pressure at a given point in real space changes from @xmath6 to @xmath1 as the magnification is increased from @xmath4 to @xmath7 . by definition of the transition probability , one would obtain @xmath20 the starting point of persson theory is an approximation to this transition probability according to : @xmath21 with @xmath22 where the @xmath23 denote the fourier coefficients of the ( combined ) surface height .",
    "the broadening of pressure @xmath24 is motivated from the exact expression for the broadening that would hold if an infinitesimally small , single - wave height fluctuation were added to an otherwise perfectly smooth interface under a finite normal pressure .",
    "it appears that it suffices to use a gaussian in place of the ( unknown ) true broadening function , because  owing to the central limit theorem  the detailed shape of transition probabilities should become irrelevant when they are applied repeatedly a large number of times .",
    "one problem of the gaussian transition probability is that it also allows negative pressures .",
    "this undesired property can be avoided by interpreting the broadening of the pressure distribution function in terms of a diffusive process : each point in the interface represents a walker , the pressure could be seen as its `` random location '' , and magnification plays the role of time .",
    "for example , as magnification goes on , the local pressure would be expected to mount when the local height increases relative to some neighborhood with greater @xmath4 , while it would diminish in the opposite case .",
    "the boundary condition of non - negative pressures not being allowed in the given context can be implemented within this interpretation by assuming that each walker hitting the @xmath2 boundary gets absorbed into it , that is , the walker gets lost to noncontact .",
    "the idea can be realized formally by subtracting a mirror gaussian from the original gaussian in so that @xmath25 .",
    "\\label{eq : transitionfinal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transition probability for negative @xmath1 can now be set to zero .",
    "moreover , at @xmath2 , a delta - function is placed , whose prefactor is chosen such that the integral over the complete transition probability is unity .",
    "an interesting property of the transition probability approach is that the distribution at any given magnification @xmath4 can be calculated from .",
    "this is done by summing over all @xmath26 contributions coming from wavevectors with @xmath27 into the transition matrix to yield @xmath28 . moreover",
    ", the initial condition ( @xmath29 ) for smooth interfaces is that the pressure is homogeneous across the interface when no roughness features are resolved .",
    "thus , it can be expressed as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the normal load and @xmath33 the nominal contact area .",
    "this leads to @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{eq : pressuredistori}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the variable @xmath1 ( without subscript @xmath35 ) for microscopic pressures while @xmath10 refers to the `` macroscopic '' pressure .    in the original version of the theory ,",
    "the magnification dependent relative contact area @xmath36 is obtained by integrating over the pressure distribution from infinitesimally small positive pressures to infinity , yielding @xmath37    in more recent versions of the theory  @xcite , persson introduced a correction to using the argument that the broadening for partial contact is less than for full contact .",
    "this leads to a modified broadening pressure @xmath38 where the `` fudge factor '' @xmath39 is parameterized to match the numerical results for the pressure - dependence of the relative contact area .",
    "the following functional form has been used @xmath40 , \\label{eq : gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 decreases monotonically from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the modification is of order unity and thus relatively minor given that many quantities span many decades , for instance the contact area , contact stiffness , and the spatial scales of the relevant wavelengths . with",
    "this modified broadening pressure , we can not write down a closed - form expression for the _ modified _ version of the _ total _ pressure broadening",
    ". it now has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "however , we may still use the formulae for the ( total ) pressure distribution and the relative contact area , as long as we insert the corrected pressure broadening terms .",
    "up to this point , the uncontrolled approximations in persson theory are : ( a ) the pressure broadening @xmath26 ( and similarly @xmath44 ) entering the transition probabilities @xmath45 only depend on @xmath46 ( and potentially on @xmath47 ) but not on the initial pressure @xmath6 of a walker in any other form , ( b ) there is no drift in pressure at any value of @xmath6 , neither before nor after adding the mirror gaussian , and ( c ) there is no flow of the probability density at @xmath2 back to positive pressure . in the interpretation of the diffusion equation ,",
    "it means that any walker gone out of contact is assumed to remain out of contact for good .",
    "another quantity of interest is the elastic energy stored in the interface , @xmath48 , which is needed , for example , in the derivation of how the contact stiffness depends on pressure . according to the original persson work  @xcite , the energy in a resolved mode is @xmath49 while unresolved modes are assumed to carry no energy . in more recent work  @xcite ,",
    "the elastic energy was also modified with a correction factor to read @xmath50 we denote the total energies stored in the interface by @xmath51 note that the contact area only depends on the nominal external load @xmath52 and the magnification @xmath53 . only the total sum or needs to be accurate in the calculations relating to contact stiffness and mean gap , and not each individual term of .",
    "it might be necessary for other applications , such as rubber friction , to impose stricter requirements .",
    "each summand associated with a given wave vector should match , on average , the corresponding term of the exact elastic energy [ eq : elasticenergy_u ] @xmath54 where the @xmath55 are the exact elastic displacements in fourier space for a given magnification and external load @xmath52 .",
    "those we determine to high accuracy from numerical simulations for a given realization of surface roughness defined by the @xmath23 .",
    "we wish to reemphasize that the purpose of this work is to analyze the starting hypotheses of persson theory rather than the final , experimentally measurable results arising from it",
    ". it may yet be useful to remind the reader that some of these final results are the subject of current debate , in particular how the contact stiffness @xmath56 or the linearly related contact conductance depend on pressure .",
    "paggi and barber  @xcite pointed out that many previous works found a power law relation @xmath57 with an exponent @xmath58 in agreement with their dimensional analysis but in contradiction to a linear relation , @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is yielded by the original persson theory that implicitly assumes the thermodynamic limit , and also found in continuum simulations in which self - affine roughness spreads only two decades  @xcite . scaling arguments proposed by pohrt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which are meaningful when contact lives only in a single meso - scale asperity , lead to an exponent @xmath60 in that solely depends on the hurst roughness exponent via @xmath61 their own numerical results , which were based on the so - called method of dimensional reduction , could not confirm this result and instead indicated that @xmath62 .",
    "however , work based on accurate gfmd simulations as well as an extension of persson theory to finite systems  @xcite found to be indeed true for pressures that are so small that contact does not spread over the interface but is located within a single meso - scale asperity . for more details , we refer the reader to the original literature  @xcite .",
    "we use green s function molecular dynamics  @xcite ( gfmd ) to calculate the response of an ideally - elastic solid to deformations caused by mechanical contact with a rough counter body .",
    "the solids are integrated over the @xmath63 coordinate and modeled as semi - infinite half - planes with hard - wall interactions in the small - slope approximation so that only normal coordinates need to be considered .",
    "the setup is thereby reduced from a three - dimensional elasticity problem with @xmath64 independent variables to a classical boundary value problem with @xmath65 grid points , where @xmath14 is the linear dimension of the system .",
    "we solve it with a molecular dynamics approach in reciprocal space , in order to reduce critical slowing - down from @xmath66 to @xmath67 . while a dynamic setup is possible , for this work we are interested mainly in the static limiting case and therefore use damped dynamics here .",
    "the details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "we use the parallel fftw library  @xcite which scales to several thousand cores .",
    "this allows us to tackle very large systems which is necessary to cover up to @xmath68 decades in roughness , close to what is found in natural or industrial surfaces  @xcite .",
    "a simulation with linear size @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath70 ( super-)atoms in an equivalent three - dimensional simulation .",
    "more in - depth detail can be found in the original literature  @xcite .",
    "before we present our tests of the assumptions made in persson theory , we comment on the dependence of contact area on pressure and resolution , as well as on our choice for pressure . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we found that few dimensionless quantities suffice to define a contact .",
    "in particular , we noticed that the contact area is essentially only a function of reduced pressure @xmath9 as long as the linear dimension of the system @xmath14 much exceeds the large - wavelength cutoff @xmath15 and the ratio of the cutoffs at small and large wavelengths is sufficiently large .",
    "as demonstrated in , we can approximate the data from our previous work via the constitutive relation @xmath71 with two fit parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 being very close to unity , and using a `` switching function '' @xmath74     representation of the relative contact area @xmath47 as a function of the reduced pressure for three different hurst exponents @xmath8 , as obtained in previous gfmd simulations  @xcite , and the approximative function , . to show the complementary relative contact area @xmath75 in the same figure",
    ", we plot @xmath76 rather than @xmath47 . ]",
    "the motivation for the functional form is that @xmath47 can be described by a single error function in the limit of low pressure and the complementary contact area by a single ( complementary ) error function in the limit of large @xmath77 .",
    "however , the numerical coefficients to be used in the error functions at small and large pressure differ slightly .",
    "this is why we introduce a switching function that is close to zero at small @xmath77 and close to one at large @xmath77 making the first summand on the r.h.s . of",
    "dominate the sum for small @xmath77 and the term @xmath78 be dominant at large @xmath77 .",
    "( since the leading correction to the linear low - pressure @xmath79 relation is third - order in pressure , we chose the switching function as the square of an error function . )",
    "previous simulations found that @xmath80 with @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "our approximation for @xmath83 is close to that value .",
    "the second term was written such that it describes the complementary contact area at large pressures in exact accordance with persson theory for @xmath84 . in agreement with a previous numerical study  @xcite",
    ", we find that a small correction needs to be applied . in principle",
    ", the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 could be optimized for different values of @xmath8 , but for the stated numbers , @xmath47 and @xmath87 are reproduced within @xmath88 accuracy for any value of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 used in the simulations .    in the current work ,",
    "we keep changing the resolution and thus it would not be meaningful to state absolute values of @xmath10",
    ". it would not be meaningful either to express pressure as @xmath92 , because each time we increase the magnification at constant @xmath10 , @xmath12 would increase as well and thus the reduced pressure would change , although the absolute pressure @xmath10 would have remained unaltered .",
    "we therefore state or plot the relative contact area at a given magnification rather than @xmath10 or @xmath77 . with the help of or",
    ", these numbers can be easily converted into reduced pressures at that magnification .",
    "furthermore , in most cases one can simply associate @xmath93 .",
    "we choose @xmath94 as unity to nondimensionalize the pressure  @xcite . for microscopic , local pressures , i.e. , those that hold for individual points at the interface , we use @xmath95 as default unit as the latter reflects the mean pressure averaged over the contact .",
    "thus , when identifying a walker with a pressure much less than unity , there is a large probability that it sits either close to a contact line or in a small patch bearing little load . as stated before , the variable @xmath1 stands for local pressures while @xmath10 refers to the `` macroscopic '' pressure .      in this section",
    "we test the first two approximations implicitly contained in persson theory .",
    "they can be described as the following two properties of the transition probability @xmath96 : ( a ) the term related to the broadening of the pressure distribution , @xmath26 depends only on @xmath46 , i.e. , the `` diffusion coefficient '' @xmath97 is independent of @xmath6 , and ( b ) the transition probability induces no drift at any pressure .    in order to test these two approximations , we first ran simulations with a maximum resolved target wave number @xmath98 with @xmath99 . in these calculations ,",
    "the hurst exponent was set to @xmath100 and a system size of @xmath101 was investigated .",
    "the pressure was chosen such that it produced a relative contact area of @xmath102 for the given magnification of @xmath99 .",
    "from the relaxed configurations we computed the pressure at each point at the interface and produced a pressure distribution function from it on a discretized mesh with constant spacing @xmath24 . for",
    "selected bins with index @xmath103 , we memorized each grid point , or walker , for which the pressure lay in the interval @xmath104 at @xmath99 .",
    "the magnification was then increased to @xmath105 and the distribution function ( of the new configuration ) evaluated over the points that had been associated with the given bins at the old magnification .",
    "this yields a discretized version of the transition probability .",
    "results are shown in .",
    "original , discretized pressure distribution @xmath0 , indicated by plus signs , at a magnification of @xmath99 . for selected bins , indicated by full circles ,",
    "the transition probability @xmath45 is recorded for @xmath106 ( right ordinate axis ) .",
    "they are shown in color .",
    "full lines represent fits to mirror gaussians as described in the appendix .",
    "starting at bin 20 , the difference to simple gaussian is negligible .",
    "the heights and thus the widths of the transition probabilities turn out to depend on pressure @xmath1 .",
    "the simulations were run with @xmath100 and @xmath107 . ]",
    "similar to , except that the simulations used here were for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and the magnification changed from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "the figures show identical trends . ]     and",
    "the singularity at @xmath112 is omitted in all cases . the mirror - gaussian function with on - the - fly determined parameters ( solid lines ) only fits well as long as the broadening is smaller than the mean .",
    "below that threshold , the description is unsuitable .",
    "it is in principle still possible to fit a mirror - gaussian to the data ( not shown ) , but the normalization is inconsistent .",
    "we therefore did not include bins @xmath113 in our analysis .",
    "[ fig : histogram_lowpbins ] ]    in , the transition probabilities are described accurately by mirror gaussians , for the bins whose mean pressure much exceeds the broadening , and information on the diffusion coefficient can be ascertained directly . for example , a systematic on - the - fly determination of the diffusion coefficient associated with one of these bins can be done by subtracting the variance obtained at the old magnification from that at the new magnification . however , special care has to be taken for the analysis of those bins representing small pressures . in [ sec : onthefly ] we describe how to compute drift and diffusion coefficients such that their determination is also meaningful when the mean pressure of a bin is smaller than the broadening .",
    "if the diffusion into the singularity at @xmath2 is negligible , even a simple gaussian suffices with high accuracy .",
    "we carried out the same analysis for @xmath108 and a much larger relative contact area of @xmath109 .",
    "shows that there is no qualitative difference for the different hurst exponents , or at different external loads",
    ".    shows bins for which the broadening is larger than the means . in this case , the procedure laid out in [ sec : onthefly ] is _ not _ suited anymore . while bin 10 is still described quite well ( but not by a simple gaussian anymore ) , for bin 6 , only the width is still acceptable .",
    "the peak is shifted slightly . for bin 2 ,",
    "finally , neither the width nor peak are suitably described .",
    "we did not include any data from bins @xmath114 in the following .    in order to arrive at more quantitative results",
    ", we conducted a moments analysis of the pressure distribution , as described in [ sec : onthefly ] , for @xmath115 bins , for a relative contact area of @xmath116 .",
    "the results shown in reveal that the drift is negligible for large pressures and that the diffusion coefficient comes out as assumed in the _ original _ version of persson theory .",
    "that means that no correction factor is required to predict the correct broadening for most values of @xmath1 , although for @xmath116 , @xmath117 in should already be close to its minimum value @xmath118 .",

    "non - negligible stochastic uncertainties remain for @xmath125 as revealed by the error bars .",
    "stochastically significant discrepancies from the drift - free and the constant - diffusion - coefficient assumptions remain for pressures @xmath119 .",
    "these can be rationalized by assuming that low - pressure points tend to be located close to a contact line .",
    "open symbols are from bins where the mirror - gaussian fit function is unsuited to determine the diffusion coefficient , even though the drift in those bins is well defined . ]",
    "it can be easily rationalized why the assumptions made in persson theory hold for @xmath126 but not for @xmath119 .",
    "walkers contributing to the histogram at pressures @xmath126 lie far away from any contact line and pressure gradients should usually be small .",
    "the assumption that additional roughness leads to small pressure perturbation is thus justified , certainly as long as @xmath127 is small compared to the linear dimension of the contact patch to which this walker belongs . in contrast",
    ", walkers contributing to the histogram at @xmath119 lie close to a contact line , or , more generally , close to a point or patch that risks to fall out of contact soon . pressure gradients are high at those positions and even diverge right at the contact line ( as in hertzian contacts ) , which explains why the diffusion coefficient picks up at small pressures .",
    "moreover , pressure gradients increase as the contact line is approached , which is consistent with the presence of a negative drift .",
    "if , however , a walker is _ extremely _ close to a contact line , there is a large probability that the walker jumps from contact with large pressure gradients to out - of - contact , where the pressure gradient is zero . this explains why the drift turns around in sign at extremely small pressures .",
    "an interesting observation in is that the pressure broadening in the contact agrees with the original , correction - parameter - free variant of persson theory rather than with the modified version . at the same time , points fall out of contact more quickly than predicted by persson theory because many walkers acquire a negative drift at @xmath128 .",
    "their number is distinctly larger than of those having a positive drift so that the average _ contact _ drift coefficient @xmath129 is negative .",
    "so far , our calculations imply that there is mean drift towards smaller pressures and an increased diffusion at small pressure as compared to the theoretical prediction . from this point of view",
    ", one would expect persson theory to overestimate the contact area . however , the opposite is true .",
    "thus , one must expect walker to re - enter contact upon an increase of magnification , which would counteract the large flux out of contact that is induced by large diffusion coefficients and negative drifts at small @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate this hypothesis next .",
    "one key assumptions in persson theory is that points at the interface are seen to fall out of contact as finer details of the surface roughness are incorporated .",
    "the idea is visualized in , which shows cuts through the converged surfaces for simulations with system sizes of @xmath130 at five different resolutions @xmath131 .",
    "the cuts are at the same location for each surface . in each panel",

    "the magnification increases from top to bottom with @xmath131 .",
    "the top ( orange ) solid holds all the compliance , while the lower ( blue ) body contains all the roughness .",
    "the gap is kept in white . even though the overall shape does not change at large magnification , the local topology does , and this causes re - entry of some points that had previously fallen out of contact . ]    a similar analysis as that for the cross section of a contact shown in is repeated in terms of a bird s eye view of the interface in .",
    "there we highlight areas that change from contact to non - contact and vice versa , as @xmath4 is increased from @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "analysis of the data reveals that the net flux to non - contact is a small fraction of @xmath134 of the flux in either direction .",
    "the large flux of points getting back into contact supports the hypothesis that reentry distinctly increases the contact area relative to the predictions by persson theory .",
    "the effect is sufficiently large to overcompensate the effects discussed in section  [ sec : driftdiffusion ] .",

    "white and blue areas represent non - contact , while gray and red show contact patches .",
    "blue and red points have changed their nature between @xmath138 and @xmath137 , i.e. , blue was in contact at @xmath138 , while red was in non - contact at the smaller magnification .",
    "since all points are in contact when only the very longest wavelength is considered ( @xmath29 ) , the red points have `` _ _ reentered _ _ '' contact . the relative contribution of red and blue are @xmath139 and @xmath140 of the apparent contact area , respectively , implying that the net flow @xmath141 is small compared to the flux in either direction .",
    "the reentry process is not accounted for by persson theory . ]    as one may expect a re - entry contact point to get out of contact soon again , it is not clear how many contact points at a given magnification are reentrant points . to answer",
    "the question how many points have _ ever _ returned to contact  or returned to non - contact  one needs to examine every single change in magnification .",
    "this is an extremely tedious and computationally expensive procedure  even for a small system , @xmath142 in size , with @xmath143 and @xmath144 , there are a total of @xmath145 different wave numbers , each of which has to be added one - by - one , and the same number of separate simulations run , for each value of the external load .",
    "in addition , this process has to be repeated for different surfaces to ensure robust numbers .",
    "we ran a set of eight different random realizations for each pressure value of size @xmath142 .",
    "we did not attempt to carry out this analysis for systems larger than @xmath146 , so that the resulting percentage is still only an estimate , as the fractal limit is not reached fully .",
    "however , it does serve as an orientation  when taking into account a larger range of magnifications more points are bound to experience re - entry than for a smaller range . nevertheless , for @xmath136 and @xmath108 , we find that @xmath147 of all contact points at the highest resolution have left and re - entered contact at a lower magnification . for @xmath148 , _ every single _ point in contact had lost contact at a lower magnification . even for @xmath149 , where contact is nearly complete , the fraction is still @xmath150 and thus non - negligible .",
    "these numbers do not change if the continuum limit is approached even closer  for @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the fractions remain the same .",
    "they do not depend much on @xmath153 either , and remain comparable for @xmath154 .",
    "the hurst exponent similarly has a very minor effect ; the numbers for @xmath89 lay within @xmath155 of those for @xmath108 , and neither showed a dependence on @xmath156 nor @xmath157 .    visualizes the reentry for a system of @xmath158 over a larger range of magnifications .",

    "gray points have been in contact at all intermediate magnifications , and white points have either been out of contact at @xmath160 or lost contact exactly once .",
    "in contrast , all points in color have experienced reentry between @xmath160 and @xmath161 ; blue points show out - of - contact reentry and red indicates contact reentry .",
    "note that there are @xmath163 times more colored points than gray points , and of all points in contact at the final magnification , @xmath164 have experienced reentry .",
    "sharp features all come from low magnifications where the surface changes relatively strongly with each added wave number .",
    "[ fig : reentry_visualization_allq ] ]    to complete the analysis of reentrance , we note that includes data for the pressure transition probability for an initial pressure of @xmath165 , similar to our analysis for finite @xmath6 . for a change from @xmath99 to @xmath105",
    ", we find about @xmath166 of all points previously in noncontact reenter contact .",
    "such points therefore act as if they came from a `` source '' in the framework of the diffusion analogy , or , more precisely , as if they were reflected  potentially with a delay  by the boundary .",
    "this can affect the functional form of the pressure distribution function and lead to deviations from a linear @xmath167 dependence at small @xmath1 , which one gets for the distribution shown in .",
    "in fact , preliminary results are in violation of a @xmath167 relationship .",
    ", after the magnification is increased to @xmath105 .",
    "the total transition probability is @xmath168 .",
    "this means that @xmath166 of all points reenter between @xmath99 and @xmath105 .",
    "[ fig : reentry_histogram ] ]      as mentioned before , the derivation of persson theory assumes that an energy mode contains no energy until the appropriate mode of roughness is resolved . beyond this magnification ,",
    "the energy in this mode is expected remain the same when even greater wave numbers are included . for various external loads , and  [ fig : elastic_energy_h03 ] demonstrate that this is an oversimplification when contact is incomplete .",
    "we plot the following expression for a given target wave number @xmath169 @xmath170 while @xmath171 is the _ predicted _ normalized energy .",
    "@xmath172 is the heaviside step function which is zero for @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath175 .",
    "we find that each mode is partially excited already at a lower magnification than expected , and peaks at a higher magnification .",
    "partly this is caused by averaging the contribution of a number of nearby wave numbers for reasons of reducing scatter .",
    "another important effect should be related to the following phenomenon : the derivative of the stress becomes singular as a contact line is approached from within the contact .",
    "it then discontinuously drops to zero outside the contact , as one can readily see in the case of a hertzian contact .",
    "this implies that the fourier coefficients of the stress and thus the strain field must be non - zero up to ( infinitely ) large wavevectors as soon as there is partial contact .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes may be small , but they are non - zero .     and a hurst exponent of @xmath108 , averaged over 8 statistically equivalent but independent random realizations .",
    "the cutoff wave numbers were @xmath176 and @xmath177 , approximately fulfilling the thermodynamic , fractal , and continuum limits .",
    "each panel shows the elastic energy for a different relative contact area at full resolution ( top to bottom ) of 0.87 , 0.32 , 0.083 , 0.009 , in a collection of nearby fourier modes with @xmath178 normalized by the energy that they are expected to have in the original persson theory , i.e. , normalized by @xmath179 .",

    "[ fig : elastic_energy_h03 ] ]    when the external load is very high , as is the case in a , contact remains complete up to high magnification , and is essentially accurate .",
    "when the pressure is reduced , as in b , or , alternatively , the magnification is increased further , less energy starts to be stored in the short - wavelength modes than predicted . however , also the long - wavelength modes are populated less than anticipated .",
    "interestingly , the energy reduction is even stronger for long wavelengths than for short wavelengths and in contradiction to the functional form of @xmath180 in , as revealed by c and  [ fig : elastic_energy_h08]d .",
    "short wavelengths are populated in a way that roughly conforms with persson theory before including the correction factor .",
    "however , long wavelength displacements do not appear to develop as much as expected and even appear to recede when roughness is added at large magnification and small external pressure .",
    "this effect is captured neither in the original version of persson theory nor in the modified version .",
    "and  [ fig : elastic_energy_h03 ] seem to show a correlation between the asymptotic value that the elastic energy , normalized with persson s prediction , converges to , and the relative change of the relative contact area .",
    "we explore this correlation in and  [ fig : asymptoticvalue_vs_dlnarel_h03 ] .",
    "the fall - off of the elastic energy turns out to be linear with magnification , so we can extrapolate the curves for @xmath181 to @xmath182 to determine the asymptotic value .",

    "the value of the constants is not universal and changes with hurst exponent , but  at least for the two cases we inspected  assumes values of @xmath187 .",
    "further investigations are necessary .",
    "the previous section showed that the individual modes of the elastic energy do not behave as persson theory assumes , except near perfect contact .",
    "nevertheless the theory quite accurately predicts the relative contact area and the mean gap found in the contact between two randomly rough elastic bodies .",
    "especially the latter depends intimately on the elastic energy  albeit not on each mode but on the total sum .",
    "still it is not obvious that the total elastic energy is correct while each individual term is inaccurate . in this section ,",
    "we examine the integrated elastic energy and compare this to the results that persson theory posits .    in order to test the correction factor that is present in persson theory , we calculate it numerically using @xmath188 where the numerator comprises the subtraction of the _ total _ elastic energy of a simulation in which everything up to a magnification of @xmath4 is resolved from that of a simulation with a slightly lower magnification .",
    "the denominator is the difference between for two different values of @xmath189 , which leaves only terms due to the _ newly resolved wavelengths_. we increment the resolution by the minimum amount possible for a given discretization , i.e. recompute the contact for each new wave number separately .",
    "this expression would yield the correction factor if each mode of the elastic energy were excited exactly at its appropriate resolution and remained constant with any further increase of resolution . similarly in that case , would yield .",
    "the numerator varies quite substantially for different values of @xmath190 . as a consequence @xmath191 converges very slowly",
    ", so is the result of more than @xmath192 sets of independent random instances , for a total of about @xmath193 million simulations of size @xmath194 .",
    "we confirmed the results with higher - resolution simulations at @xmath195 ( @xmath196 sets , @xmath197 simulations ) , and , at selected magnifications , with @xmath198 ( @xmath199 sets , @xmath200 simulations ) .",
    "the latter also include magnifications up to @xmath138 .    , see , versus magnification , for different pressures .",
    "solid lines are @xmath201 , while open circles ( @xmath202 ) and filled squares ( @xmath198 ) are size - scaled data which shows that the values are converged .",
    "the data is averaged over between @xmath203 and @xmath204 different realizations of the rough surface . ]",
    "since we know from and  [ fig : elastic_energy_h03 ] that the individual modes of the elastic energy @xmath205 do _ not _ behave exactly as assumed in persson theory , may not be an appropriate comparison .",
    "instead , we consider the deviations of the _ total _ elastic energy with respect to the magnification and to the measured relative contact area . @xmath206",
    "the results are shown in ( varying @xmath4 for @xmath207 ) and ( for @xmath208 , varying @xmath52 , and therefore @xmath47 ) .",
    "they reveal that using indeed significantly improves agreement between theory and numerical measurements compared with the original theory where @xmath209 .",
    "nevertheless , the total elastic energy is still overestimated by @xmath210 even with the more complicated functional form . at low pressures ,",
    "even the correction factor is insufficient to get theory and measurement to agree .    , while the dashed lines hold for @xmath211 as given in . for high and intermediate pressures , the corrected expression yields very good values . at @xmath212 and low magnification",

    "each data set is an average over @xmath203 different random realizations .",
    "the correction factor works well for @xmath213 ; at even lower pressures , the deviation from the measurement increases dramatically . ]",
    "in this work , we have revealed quite significant shortcomings of the assumptions entering persson s contact mechanics theory . however , many errors cancel , which explains why quite a few interfacial properties are predicted very accurately by the theory .",
    "it is nevertheless not clear if _ all _ interfacial properties benefit from such cancelations so that the theory might need to be improved for some applications .",
    "for example , in the context of rubber friction or other problems involving moving interfaces , the inaccurate partitioning of energy amongst different modes might be problematic . at the current stage of development",
    ", only the _ net _ elastic energy of a relaxed configuration turns out reasonable . despite our criticism ,",
    "we recognize persson theory as the only theory for rough , linearly - elastic contacts that is based on controlled approximations and reveals accurate information not only on scalar numbers but also on distribution functions including contact geometry .",
    "the theory is essentially only based on directly measurable quantities and thus free of _ ad - hoc _ parameters except for one correction factor of order unity . in this work we found evidence that this correction factor is needed but has so far been implemented only heuristically .",
    "our results indicate that the correction factor does not yield very accurate elastic energies at low pressure and moreover is sensitive to the rate at which the relative contact area decreases with increasing resolution rather than to the relative contact area itself .",
    "one reason why the gap distribution functions are nevertheless predicted quite accurately may be that for low pressures the mean gap is approximately only logarithmic in pressure  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a change in gap is only a logarithmic function of energy so that only the order of magnitude of the energy needs to be known . for high pressures , on the other hand ,",
    "persson theory is quite accurate .",
    "correcting individual ingredients to the contact mechanics theory might disturb a delicate balance of error cancelations which is currently present",
    ". it might therefore be necessary to make adjustments to the elastic energy and the various aspects of the diffusion analogy simultaneously so that the predictions of the quantities tested so far do not deteriorate .",
    "it would certainly be desirable to motivate corrections to the theory without making _ ad - hoc _ or uncontrolled assumptions .",
    "one possible avenue to derive such corrections is to consider a model in which hard - wall repulsion is replaced with smoother repulsion , such as exponential repulsion , which is more amenable to analytical calculations than ( non - holonomic ) hard - wall constraints .",
    "in fact , one of the authors investigated such a model  @xcite and proposed that stress - dependent drift arises beyond a second - order cumulant expansion of the model , which is formally equivalent to persson theory .",
    "pursuing such an expansion might , however , turn out tedious .",
    "the analytical expressions become increasingly involved with each added order and the next non - vanishing term for colored - noise surfaces only arises at fourth order .",

    "the deduction of drift and diffusion coefficients from data for the transition probability , @xmath45 , as shown in , becomes non - trivial when the magnification - induced broadening is no longer small compared to @xmath6 .",
    "it is then no longer sufficient to assume that the increase of the second moment of the pressure from old to new magnification reflects the broadening .",
    "an example is the case for the distribution associated with the bin number 10 in .",
    "the reason why looking at the change in the second moment of the distribution is no longer sufficient is that some walkers belonging to bin 10 at the original magnification have fallen out of contact at the new magnification , as one can see , in , by the ( blue ) triangle at @xmath2 .",
    "this is why walkers having landed at @xmath2 no longer contribute to the random walk , at least as long as they stay outside the contact .",
    "thus , rather than fitting to gaussians , it would be better to fit the new probabilities to the function displayed on the r.h.s . of . the value for @xmath6 , however , would be allowed to differ from the first moment of the pressure associated with the original bin .    instead of fitting the measured transition probabilities to",
    ", we ask the question what parameters @xmath6 and @xmath24 should be used to reproduce the first two moments of the individual bin distribution at the new magnification .",
