    "@xmath17 , one has that @xmath18 so that diffusion occurs through the resonant scattering of the particles on the magnetic field components with wavelengths of order @xmath19 .",
    "this propagation regime is usually referred to as the quasi - linear regime or resonant diffusion .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath20 depends on the power of the magnetic field on the scales of the larmor radius , and hence depends on the turbulent magnetic field spectrum .",
    "typically one has @xmath21 , where for a kolmogorov spectrum @xmath22 , for a kraichnan spectrum @xmath23 while the so - called bohm diffusion adopts @xmath24 ( corresponding to the assumption @xmath25 ) .",
    "the diffusion length @xmath20 corresponds to the distance for which the typical particle deflection is 1  rad , and hence is related to the basic step in the random walk of the diffusing particles .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is just @xmath26 and the rectilinear distance @xmath27 travelled by particles in their random walk after a time @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 .    when @xmath30 ( i.e. for @xmath31 ) the scattering is non - resonant and is the result of many small deflections , with @xmath32 in each coherence length @xmath4 . as a result , after @xmath33 steps the deflection is @xmath34  rad , so that one obtains @xmath35 and we see that the diffusion length strongly increases with energy .",
    "two regimes are possible here depending on the overall distance travelled ( i.e. depending on the source distance @xmath8 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath36 spatial diffusion of the particles takes place , while at energies for which @xmath20 becomes larger than @xmath8 the overall deflections become small and the quasi - rectilinear propagation of the particles takes place , leading to just a small angular diffusion of the particle trajectories .    cosmic rays ( crs ) arriving to the earth are deflected by both the galactic and the extra - galactic magnetic fields .",
    "regarding the deflections in the galactic fields , which have typical strengths of few @xmath37 g with the random component having @xmath38100  pc , the critical energy is @xmath39  eev and the particles reach the quasi - rectilinear propagation in the turbulent field ( @xmath40  kpc , which is the typical vertical extent of the random magnetic field ) for energies @xmath41  ev , and somewhat larger for directions along the galactic plane .",
    "actually , the dominant deflections in the galactic magnetic field are expected to be those caused by the regular component , due to its larger coherence length of order @xmath42  kpc . as a result ,",
    "the galactic magnetic field deflections at eev energies are large even for cr protons .",
    "although these deflections can significantly modify the arrival directions ( hence diluting possible anisotropy signals ) they do not affect the expected overall spectrum nor the composition of the extra - galactic cosmic rays .",
    "focusing now on the extra - galactic magnetic fields , the simplest assumption is to consider a uniform turbulent field permeating intergalactic space .",
    "strengths for @xmath3 in the range from 0.01  ng up to 100  ng and coherence lengths @xmath4 from 10  kpc ( as could be associated to galactic outflows ) up to 50  mpc ( as could be associated to supercluster scales ) have been considered and minimum one @xmath43 one has that @xmath44 @xcite . ] .",

    "a review with some magnetic field upper bounds obtained in the literature for different values of @xmath4 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the average separation between the uhecr sources @xmath5 is related to their density @xmath49 through @xmath50 , with @xmath51  mpc for @xmath52  mpc@xmath53 while @xmath54  mpc for @xmath55  mpc@xmath53 , which covers the range of densities usually considered .",
    "crs from a source at distance @xmath5 will have a diffusive propagation ( i.e. @xmath56 ) as long as @xmath57 , where ( assuming the non - resonant diffusive regime to hold ) one gets @xmath58 hence , even protons from the closest sources may have a diffusive behavior up to eev energies for values of @xmath59 , and up to higher energies for sources farther away , with nuclei having a similar behavior but shifted up in energy by a factor @xmath0 ( i.e. equal for the same rigidities ) .",
    "two additional ingredients are fundamental in shaping the cr spectra of the different elements : the interactions with the radiation backgrounds and cosmological evolution effects .",
    "cr energy losses arise from adiabatic losses ( d@xmath60 , with @xmath61 being hubble s constant in terms of the scale factor @xmath62 ) , which are present at all energies , and from the interaction losses due to different processes .",
    "the pair ( @xmath63 creation losses are relevant for interactions with cmb photons of energy @xmath64  ev , requiring cr lorentz factors @xmath65 and hence @xmath66  eev for nuclei with mass number @xmath67 . actually , the energy loss length for protons becomes smaller than the hubble horizon @xmath68 , with @xmath69  km / s / mpc , for energies @xmath70  eev , while for heavy nuclei the combination of increased threshold and larger pair production cross section , @xmath71 , leads to an energy loss length comparable to @xmath72 for @xmath73  eev @xcite .",
    "the photo - pion production off cmb photons becomes significant only for very high energies , @xmath74  eev , while the photo - disintegration of nuclei is relevant for @xmath75  eev for interactions with cmb photons and down to lower energies for interactions with higher energy background photons such as ir or optical ones .",
    "however , for interactions with ir photons the energy loss length for photo - disintegration is larger than the hubble horizon except for heavy nuclei such as fe for which it is larger than @xmath72 only for @xmath76   eev @xcite . as a result of these considerations , we can say that in general for @xmath77  eev the energy losses are mainly due to the adiabatic ones while the ones due to interactions are small .",
    "in addition to the adiabatic losses , cosmological effects also enter in the increase of the cmb density and temperature with redshift , in possible redshift evolution of the other radiation backgrounds , of the cr source density and emissivity and eventually also in the magnetic field evolution .",
    "the effects of cr diffusion in extra - galactic magnetic fields were discussed in several works in the past ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a detailed analytic treatment of the proton diffusion in an expanding universe was performed by berezinsky and gazizov @xcite , generalizing the syrovatskii solution @xcite which provides the cr density as a function of the distance to a source in a static universe and accounting for the energy losses during propagation .",
    "the general solution obtained in @xcite is that the contribution to the flux from a given source at comoving distance @xmath8 ( i.e. corresponding to its present distance ) is @xmath78\\frac{\\exp[-r_s^2/(4\\lambda^2)]}{(4\\pi\\lambda^2)^{3/2 } } \\frac{de_g}{de } , \\label{js.eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the maximum source redshift , @xmath80 is the original energy at redshift @xmath81 of a particle having energy @xmath82 at redshift @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the source spectra , which we will take as a sum of the contributions @xmath85 from the different charges , and we will adopt a power law with a maximum rigidity cutoff @xmath86 , modeled as @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 accounts for the relative contribution of nuclei of charge @xmath0 to the flux , the function @xmath89 accounts for the eventual redshift evolution of the source emissivity and the spectral slope @xmath90 is expected to be in the range 22.4 in fermi type diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the cosh@xmath91 allows to implement a smooth suppression of the spectrum without affecting significantly the spectral shape at @xmath92 , unlike what happens when an exponential cutoff is adopted .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ js.eq ] ) is the generalized syrovatskii variable , given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "moreover @xmath97 where @xmath69  km / s / mpc is the present hubble constant , @xmath98 the matter content and @xmath99 the cosmological constant contribution at present .",
    "note that @xmath100 can be interpreted as the typical radial comoving distance from the source traversed by a particle leaving from it at redshift @xmath81 and arriving at present with energy @xmath82 .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ js.eq ] ) was derived for protons , it can in principle also be applied to nuclei expressing it in terms of the particle rigidities .",
    "a relevant fact of photo - disintegration processes for nuclei is that they approximately conserve the lorentz factor and the rigidity of the main fragment and hence do not affect significantly the diffusion properties of the particles have approximately half the rigidity of their parent nuclei . ] .",
    "a possible complication is that when photo - disintegration losses are important the source term @xmath84 should refer to the one of the primary nucleus which gave rise to the observed one , and this is hard to obtain , in particular due to the stochastic nature of the process .",
    "however , at low energies when the photo - disintegration losses become small ( which is the regime we will focus in below ) the expression in eq .",
    "( [ js.eq ] ) can be used reliably .",
    "the general results of the diffusion effects is to suppress the cr flux at low rigidities , since particles are not able to arrive to the observer from distant sources and take a much longer time than in the case of rectilinear propagation to arrive from the nearby ones .",
    "however , a very important result is the so - called propagation theorem @xcite , which states that as long as the distance to the nearest sources is smaller than the other relevant length scales ( diffusion length and energy loss length ) , the total cr flux will be the same as that obtained ignoring magnetic field effects and for a continuous distribution of sources .",
    "this means that even at energies for which far away sources do not contribute anymore , as long as the observer lies within the diffusion sphere of the nearby sources the spectrum is unchanged and only when the nearest sources get suppressed one has that the overall spectrum is modified .",
    "it is hence important to study in detail the suppression effect of the closest sources .    a crucial relation to prove the propagation theorem is to sum over the sources in eq .",
    "( [ js.eq ] ) , assuming for simplicity equal source luminosities , and in the limit of small source separations replace the sum as @xmath101 , and use that @xmath102 and hence we see that the diffusion effects do not modify the total flux for a continuous source distribution .    in order to estimate the suppression due to the finite distance to the sources we will compute the actual sum adopting a particular realization of distance distributions corresponding to a uniform source density , taking the source distances from the observer as @xmath103 , which corresponds to the average value of the distance to the @xmath104-th closest source for a uniform source distribution . hence , when one performs the sum over sources with a discrete source distribution , instead of getting unity as in eq .",

    "this is motivated by the fact that there is evidence for a non - negligible proton fraction at eev energies from auger , hires and ta experiments @xcite .",
    "this light component should presumably be of extra - galactic origin since galactic protons would be in tension with the strict bounds on dipolar anisotropies obtained by auger in this energy range @xcite . focusing on energies below @xmath0  eev leads to the simplification that the main energy loss process is just the one due to adiabatic losses , and",
    "we will obtain in this case a simpler analytic expression for the suppression of the flux due to the magnetic diffusion from the discrete set of sources . in an appendix",
    "we discuss the effects of including pair production losses in the case of protons to illustrate the validity of our approach .",
    "regarding the diffusion coefficients , we note that the detailed values of the diffusion length in the presence of turbulence can be obtained by monte carlo simulations of the particle propagation in random magnetic fields and studying the decorrelation times ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "note that one expects that @xmath110 , while the magnetic field evolution can be parameterized as @xmath111 , where the @xmath112 factor arises from flux conservation , and the factor @xmath113 was introduced in @xcite to account for additional mhd effects ( and taken there as @xmath114 ) .",

    "( [ jza.eq ] ) ) . for this computation we can take @xmath129 , since we will be interested in scenarios for which the suppression happens for energies well below @xmath130 , and the results obtained are hence independent of @xmath130 .",
    "note that once written in terms of @xmath123 , the suppression factor @xmath131 is the same for all nuclei .",
    "the suppression factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] adopting @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the resulting values depend on the average distance between sources @xmath5 and the coherence length @xmath4 through the combination @xmath135 and results are displayed for @xmath136 , 1 , 2 and 5 as a function of @xmath123 .",
    "approximate fits to these results can be obtained through the expression @xmath137 , \\label{gfit.eq}\\ ] ] with @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "these fits are also shown in figure  3 with solid lines .",
    "note that for @xmath142 the diffusion coefficient has the moderate energy dependence @xmath143 for the assumed kolmogorov turbulence and hence the suppression factor decreases more slowly with decreasing energies , while for @xmath144 there is a strong energy dependence of the suppression factor and for different values of @xmath145 it is essentially just shifted in energy proportionally to @xmath145 .",
    "1.0 truecm    the flux suppression is mainly due to the fact that at low energies crs are unable to reach the earth from the faraway sources and moreover they take a very long time to arrive to the earth from the nearby ones , so that the low redshift contribution from these last is absent ( in the diffusive regime the redshift gives a measure of propagation time rather than distance ) .",
    "hence , the suppression factor @xmath131 has some sensitivity to source evolution effects because these determine the relative contribution to the flux arising from different redshifts . in fig .",
    "4 we show the factor @xmath131 for @xmath146 and different assumptions on the cosmological parameters : the cases of source emissivity evolution as @xmath147 with @xmath148 ( while @xmath149 in the remaining cases ) , the case @xmath150 and that for the magnetic field evolution parameter @xmath151 , besides the case corresponding to the parameters adopted in the previous figure .",
    "the results vary slightly , except if a very strong source emissivity evolution is adopted , what could lead to a reduced suppression ( larger @xmath131 ) due to the larger contribution to the observed crs from high - redshift ( i.e. longer propagation times , allowing for more diffusion ) . in this case",
    "the suppression factor @xmath131 is similar in shape but gets shifted to lower values of @xmath123 .",
    "hence , adopting a value for @xmath145 one finds that a given suppression factor would lead to inferred values of @xmath14 larger by a factor about 1.5 in the case of strong evolution with respect to what would be obtained in the case of uniform source evolution .",
    "we note that the evolution of the source emissivity considered here is not equivalent to assuming an evolution in the source density , since increasing this last would decrease the typical source distance , shifting the magnetic suppression effect also to lower energies but due to different physical reasons .",
    "1.0 truecm    a necessary condition to have diffusion from the nearest source is that @xmath56 , and hence @xmath57 ( with @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ es.eq ] ) , from which one gets @xmath153 ) .",
    "moreover , for the flux from the nearest source to arrive in a typical time scale of the order of the hubble time , so that the suppression is significant , one needs that @xmath154 and hence one needs , in the regime in which @xmath155 , that @xmath156 . actually , looking at the detailed results in figure  3 we see that in the non - resonant diffusion regime ( i.e. for @xmath144 ) the suppression factor starts to become noticeable ( @xmath157 ) for @xmath158 and it reaches the value @xmath159 for the energy @xmath160 given by @xmath161 hence , introducing the corresponding rigidity value @xmath162 we find the following relation between the different parameters involved ( valid for @xmath163 )",
    "@xmath164    we note that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ jza.eq ] ) is valid as long as the interaction energy losses are small . in the case of nuclei , if photo - disintegration processes produce some amount of secondaries these particles will diffuse similarly as their parent nuclei and their final suppression will then be similar may be slightly larger for secondary nuclei due to their preferential production at relatively higher redshifts where lorentz factors are larger and radiation backgrounds more relevant , but we ignore these effects which are not expected to lead to large differences . ] .",
    "we will hence apply in the following the suppression factor to the fluxes of both primary and secondary nuclei surviving at low energies .",
    "we have checked that considering proton scenarios with large maximum energies ( @xmath165  ev ) we obtain results consistent with the numerical simulations in @xcite and @xcite ( after accounting for the slightly different diffusion coefficients adopted ) ,",
    "while considering mixed composition scenarios with large maximum rigidities we obtain results consistent with those in @xcite .",
    "we will be interested in the following in scenarios with relatively low maximum rigidities , @xmath166@xmath167  eev , like those considered in refs .",
    "this is motivated by the observed trend in the mass composition measured by the auger observatory , which suggests a transition towards heavier elements starting above a few eev , which would naturally result if the lighter elements can no longer be accelerated above the indicated cutoff energies .",
    "these ` low cutoff scenarios ' have not been studied in detail in the presence of extra - galactic magnetic field effects ( some qualitative considerations were given in @xcite ) .",

    "in addition to the extra - galactic fluxes we also include an additional ` galactic ' component so as to match the total spectrum down to @xmath42  eev . this extra component may be just the high energy tail of the galactic crs but may eventually also receive contributions from fainter but closer extra - galactic sources , less suppressed by magnetic diffusion effects .",

    "1.0 truecm    we should mention that the finite distance to the closest sources can also make the ` gzk ' suppression at the highest energies stronger than in the case of a continuous source distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this effect is expected to be more pronounced in scenarios with high rigidity cutoffs for which the effects of the ` gzk ' suppression are important , while in the scenarios we considered with low rigidity cutoffs this should have only a minor impact , and the high energy suppression of the spectrum is largely due to the source acceleration cutoff itself rather than to the propagation effects .",
    "given the arbitrariness in the shape of the cutoff function adopted , which ultimately models the suppression at the highest energies in our case , we do not include the additional suppression from the finite source distance effect at the highest energies .    in the previous plots of the spectrum and composition ( figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] to [ fig8 ] ) we fixed the parameters @xmath145 and @xmath185 , which determine the shape and location respectively of the suppression due to the magnetic diffusion .",

    "notice also that a detailed interpretation of the composition results depends actually on the assumed hadronic models .",
    "in addition , one should keep in mind that results from hires and telescope array are compatible with a light component even at energies above 10  eev @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectrum is still affected by the systematics of the energy determination , as is evident from the differences between auger and hires spectra .",
    "in this work we have considered in detail the low energy spectral suppression appearing when the density of extra - galactic uhecr sources is low and crs diffuse in turbulent extra - galactic magnetic fields .",

    "the magnetic diffusion effects then allow to suppress the extragalactic nuclei contribution at @xmath77  eev without requiring the introduction of very hard source spectra and can hence lead to results more consistent with the overall composition trends measured by the auger collaboration also for source spectra compatible with fermi shock acceleration ( @xmath1332.4 ) .",

    "( [ js.eq ] ) is ( see appendix in @xcite ) @xmath201,\\ ] ] where to a good approximation one can use that d@xmath202 @xcite .",
    "combining all this we can then compute the suppression factor including energy losses due to pair production , with the results shown in fig .",
    "we here adopted @xmath203  ng , @xmath204  mpc ( leading to @xmath205  eev ) and @xmath206  eev ( the results have only a mild dependence on the value of @xmath130 adopted ) . the left panel is the equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] while the right panel to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as can be seen from the left panel the resulting suppression factors",
    "are essentially unchanged at low energies ( solid lines represent the fits obtained ignoring pair creation losses which were also shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . only in the cases",
    "in which @xmath207  eev , corresponding to large values of @xmath145 ( actually for @xmath208  eev ) the flux suppression has some noticeable changes , as in the case shown for @xmath209 , and to a minor extent for the case @xmath210 . for large @xmath145",
    "the suppression is approximately similar in shape to that obtained ignoring pair losses but it is slightly shifted to higher energies .",
    "this also implies that the final spectra obtained assuming a given value of @xmath160 will be quite independent of whether pair production losses are included or not , but eventually what can change for large values of @xmath145 is the relation between @xmath160 and the underlying magnetic field parameters and source distances ( tending to reduce the required values of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we note that when pair losses are included one finds that for @xmath211  eev and at high redshifts the initial energy @xmath80 can be much larger than @xmath212 , showing an explosive increase with redshift as soon as @xmath213  eev .",
    "when this happens , the contribution to @xmath200 arising from higher redshifts gets very suppressed .",
    "this explains the behavior observed , where the increased flux suppression is the result of the competition between two opposite effects .",
    "on one side the larger values of @xmath80 obtained including pair losses lead to larger values for @xmath93 , what would suggest that the flux should be less suppressed ( see eq .",
    "( [ ffit.eq ] ) ) .",
    "however , the fact that higher redshifts contribute less to @xmath200 implies that the overall suppression , caused by the fact that crs from nearby sources have not enough time to diffuse from small redshifts , ends up being stronger .",
    "the behavior of @xmath80 also explains why including pair losses the suppression factors become quite insensitive to the maximum redshift considered , as is apparent from the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "we hence conclude that when pair creation losses are included the suppression factors for given values of @xmath145 and @xmath160 remain essentially unchanged as long as @xmath214  eev .",
    "the case of nuclei should be similar ( with the suppression factors below @xmath0  eev remaining unaffected ) but the inclusion of photo - disintegration effects would make the analysis more involved in this case ."
