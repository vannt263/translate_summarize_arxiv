    "uncertain destruction rates , the lack of suitable ( young , resolved ) remnants , in combination with possible foreground ( or background ) contamination from unrelated dust clouds along the line of sight , makes it difficult to confirm whether massive - star sne are dominant dust producers in galaxies .",

    "regardless of the complexity of the model , these works show that the dust abundance may not necessarily follow the metal abundances in the ism given different sources of dust and destruction .",
    "because of the stellar origin of both metals and dust grains , the dust - to - metals gradient along a galactic disc can therefore be regarded as a diagnostic for net dust growth or net destruction of dust in the ism .",

    "only pixels with @xmath6 were used in the fits .",
    "the flux per unit area in each pixel was modelled as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the planck distribution and the emissivity / absorptivity of the dust grains is a power law @xmath9 .",
    "they assumed a value for the coefficient @xmath10 of @xmath11 , which corresponds to a typical interstellar dust composition @xcite .",
    "keeping @xmath12 unchanged is , in principle , physically inconsistent .",

    "this makes sense for our constant @xmath14 model , but for varying @xmath0 , the extrapolation does not quite hold . in m31",
    "we have regions with @xmath15 ( inner 5 kpc ) and regions with @xmath16 ( outer regions ) .",
    "if we were to ` correct ' the dust masses here using @xmath12 scaled with @xmath17 ( the most extreme inner @xmath0 ) , @xmath12 would decrease by a factor of 2 and we would get a _ higher _ dust mass . in the outer regions , scaling @xmath12 with @xmath18 ( most extreme outer @xmath0 ) , @xmath12 would increase by a factor of 3.5 and we would get 3.5 times _ lower _ dust masses .",

    "@xmath0 was therefore allowed to vary across m31 [ see @xcite , fig .  7 ] with an estimated error in @xmath0 in any pixel of @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a degeneracy between @xmath12 and the dust - mass density @xmath21 in the above model .",
    "it is quite likely ( if not certain ) that variations in @xmath0 correspond to variations in @xmath12 , which means that the assumed @xmath12 can put a bias on the resultant dust density @xmath21 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath0 with increasing galactocentric distance in m31 can therefore mean that we are underestimating the dust mass in its central parts .",
    "we will return to this issue later .",
    "@xcite also created a dust - to - gas map of m31 .",
    "the gas map was obtained by combining the atomic ( hi ) and molecular ( h@xmath22 ) maps ( the sum of which is adopted as the ` gas mass ' ) .",
    "the atomic hydrogen was derived from the hi moment - zero map presented in @xcite and the molecular hydrogen was derived from co(@xmath231 - 0 ) observations presented in @xcite made with the iram 30 m telescope ( full details are provided in @xcite ) . note that although the co map requires correcting to h@xmath22 [ the so - called x factor , here taken to be @xmath24  mol  @xmath25(k  km  s@xmath26)@xmath26 ] , the correction may depend on the metallicity of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that the molecular gas in m31 is only 7% of the atomic hydrogen gas , we note that this correction does not affect the conclusions of this work .",
    "the sed fitting procedure described above resulted in three parameters for each pixel across m31 : the dust surface density @xmath21 , dust temperature @xmath28 and the dust emissivity index @xmath0 .",
    "combining with the gas map , we also have the gas surface density in each pixel @xmath29 .",
    "we have binned the data in terms of consecutive radial annuli ( each 2kpc wide , deprojected assuming an inclination of @xmath30 ) and computed the mean value in each bin for all of these parameters . based on the scatter in each radial bin ,",
    "we have also computed the 1-@xmath31 deviation from the mean values .",
    "the resultant binned data are plotted on top of a radial projection of the dust map data in fig .",
    "[ binned ] .",
    "one can see in the upper panels that the dust is generally below 20k outside of the very centre ( @xmath32 ) , with an odd ` dip ' in the grain temperatures between @xmath33 ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ binned ] ) .",
    "the binned @xmath0-values change significantly over the disc from @xmath34 to @xmath35 and as noted in @xcite , increases initially out to @xmath36 , then decreases radially .",
    "@xcite have also found evidence of a varying @xmath0 in m31 .",
    "it is not unexpected for the dust emissivity index ( @xmath0 ) to vary across a galaxy , indeed this may tell us something about composition of the dust at different galactocentric distances .",
    "low values ( @xmath37 ) would indicate that the dust component is dominated by amorphous carbonaceous dust @xcite , while higher values ( @xmath38 ) indicate domination by silicates or graphite @xcite .",
    "the highest values ( where @xmath39 ) can be associated with the lowest dust temperatures , which suggests these @xmath0-values may be explained by low - temperature effects in silicates . @xcite",
    "have shown that low - temperature effects occur in the laboratory at grain temperatures below @xmath40  k , which is indeed lower than the lowest grain temperatures obtained from the sed fits , but one should bear in mind that the grain temperatures obtained from the fits represent effective temperatures for the whole dust component and not a specific dust species as in the laboratory experiments .",
    "moreover , it also suggests that interstellar silicates are not necessarily iron rich , because silicate species such as pyroxenes ( [ mg , fe]sio@xmath41 ) and olivine s ( [ mg , fe]@xmath22sio@xmath42 ) are heated more efficiently due to their higher absorptivity relative to iron - free silicates .",
    "however , treating @xmath0 as a free parameter means we are at a potential risk of parameter degeneracy between the dust temperature @xmath28 and the @xmath0-value ( see discussion in section [ dtgbeta ] ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that while there is a @xmath43 degeneracy from the fitting algorithm this does not create any systematic offsets in the value returned and therefore can not explain the radial trends . to explore the possible effect on the dust - to - gas ratio along the disc , we have reconsidered the sed fitting to the helga dust map using a fixed @xmath14 .",
    "this value is a reasonable compromise , which is appropriate for the local ism in the galaxy @xcite and it is also in close agreement with the average @xmath0 value obtained from the varying-@xmath0 model .",
    "the resultant dust - to - gas profile is flatter for @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ binned_fixedb ] ) , though there is a clear , approximately exponential , profile in @xmath44 along the disc of m31 regardless of how we treat @xmath0 ( see figs .",
    "[ binned ] and [ binned_fixedb ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "the dust temperatures are also generally higher and the temperature gradient along the disc looks more as one would expect , i.e. , @xmath28 is essentially decreasing monotonously with galactocentric distance .",
    "this means the odd ` broken ' feature in the radial @xmath28-profile is gone , with @xmath28 simply decreasing with radius along the disc .      in order to estimate the overall distribution of metals in m31 we have gathered metallicity data from the literature for h ii regions @xcite , young stars @xcite and planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "we use the oxygen abundance ( o / h ) as a proxy for the overall metallicity .",
    "this works well for our purposes , but it is worth remembering that the conversion factor from oxygen abundance to total abundance of metals is different in low- and high - metallicity environments ( cf .",
    "o / fe versus fe / h in the galaxy according to , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we adopt a universal conversion factor , which is justified by the fact that m31 has relatively similar o / h ratios ( metallicity ) across its disc ( i.e. , the conversion factor can be treated as a constant ) .",
    "thus , to obtain the total metal fraction ( metallicity ) @xmath45 we first convert the number abundances of oxygen into oxygen mass fractions using the relation @xmath46 @xcite , in which we have implicitly assumed @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , for m31 we may assume the oxygen typically makes up about a third of all metals ( which is at the low end of the possible range , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* where 45 - 60% is the suggested value ) and thus @xmath48 .",
    "an oxygen fraction as low as 40% ( @xmath49 ) is similar to the new solar value ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an even lower fraction is expected at super - solar metallicity .",
    "one third of oxygen is therefore a reasonable assumption , which also ensures that we do not underestimate the metal content of m31 ( see section [ dtmgrad ] for a discussion on why this is important ) .",
    "the adopted oxygen fraction is otherwise not critical in the present study .",
    "depending on the method of derivation , the derived abundance from emission spectra can vary significantly .",
    "in particular , there is a well - known offset between strong - line calibrations from empirical data and those based on photoionization models and , in general , we have to deal with the fact that oxygen abundances derived from emission spectra have no empirical _ absolute _ scale either . to obtain a homogenous set of oxygen abundances for the h ii regions , we have re - derived o / h using the empirical strong - line calibrations by @xcite and @xcite , which are known to agree well with electron - temperature based abundances .",
    "we use the on - calibration by @xcite for all cases where the [ o  ii]@xmath50 line is detected with sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n  @xmath51 ) . in the remaining cases we use the ns - calibration by @xcite , provided the [ s  ii]@xmath526717 + @xmath526731 lines are measured .",
    "we add also a 0.1 dex correction for dust depletion , which seems to appear in hii regions above a certain metallicity @xcite .",
    "dust depletion can not explain the dust - to - metals gradient , however .    in fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] , we have plotted the resultant o / h ratios together with corresponding ratios derived from stars and planetary nebulae .",
    "the empirical abundances for the h ii regions agree nicely with the stellar abundances .",
    "the abundances in h ii regions agree with the abundances derived for planetary nebulae in the outer disc .",
    "a linear fit to all the metallicity data ( see black line in fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] ) yields , @xmath53 suggesting the metallicity gradient is much flatter than the dust - to - gas gradient .",
    "the outermost data points in fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] suggest a flat gradient beyond a certain galactocentric distance .",
    "a ` broken gradient ' fit yields almost exactly the same slope as above for @xmath54  kpc and a flat metallicity gradient beyond @xmath55  kpc ( see the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] ) .",
    "since we are , in this work , only interested in the part of the disc inside a radius of 20 kpc ( see the region inside the white circle in fig .",
    "[ dustmap ] and the grey shaded area in fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] ) , we will in the following adopt equation ( [ ohgrad ] ) .",
    "overall , the metallicity gradient for m31 can not be very steep regardless of the source for the metallicity data .      with @xmath45",
    "derived as above , we are faced with a problem ( which is also seen in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the highest metals - to - gas ratios appears to be _ lower _ than the corresponding dust - to - gas ratios , i.e , the dust - to - metals ratio ( @xmath56 ) is greater than unity .",
    "this is clearly unphysical , and may arise from underestimating the metallicity , or overestimating the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "it is not likely that we have significantly underestimated the metallicity since the errors of the abundance data are moderate and we have assumed a relatively small oxygen fraction in order to maximize the metallicity . we are thus left with an overestimated dust abundance as the only reasonable option . as mentioned in section  [ datadust ] ,",
    "the emissivity law used in the modified blackbody fit to derive the dust surface density was anchored to the emissivity at @xmath57 m with @xmath58 appropriate for milky way - type grains .",
    "the dust composition of m31 may be somewhat different and variations in e.g. , the abundance of silicates relative to carbonaceous dust or the presence of grains with ice mantles , can easily account for an uncertainty of almost a factor of two in the dust surface density .",
    "we therefore choose to correct the derived dust density by an appropriate factor ( given below , in the next paragraph ) such that the dust - to - metals ratio @xmath56 never exceeds unity .",
    "we suggest that the maximum dust - to - metals ratio realistically expected to be reached in the ism is @xmath59 , i.e. , the fraction of metals in the ism locked up in dust grains can not exceed 90% . the degree of dust overabundance @xmath60",
    "is then defined as @xmath61 the corrected dust - to - gas ratios that we will use later for our model fitting are thus @xmath62 .",
    "the required correction factor is @xmath63 for a varying @xmath0 and @xmath64 for @xmath14 .",
    "this may be interpreted as @xmath65 , which suggests the emissivity at @xmath57 m in m31 should be @xmath66 in the case of a varying @xmath0 and @xmath67 for @xmath14 .",
    "the latter value is close to the value according to the @xcite model , i.e. , @xmath68 for @xmath14 ( see eq . 5 in * ?",
    "overall , this means the dust - to - metals ratio is strongly dependent on the dust model ( i.e. dust composition ) .",
    "a correction of about a factor of 3 is also in agreement with the empirical emissivities obtained by @xcite for three nearby spiral galaxies ( ngc 891 , ngc 4013 and ngc 5907 ) .",
    "they found that the emissivity must be roughly three times the value typically adopted for the galaxy , which also means that galactic sub - mm dust emissivity may be underestimated , a conclusion that is supported by our results .",
    "but note that these are edge - on spirals , where line of sight effects are largest .",
    "the elevated emissivities can certainly be disputed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is also interesting to note that high emissivities have been found in dense , cold molecular cores , which is thought to be the result of more efficient coagulation into complex dust aggregates @xcite .",
    "the dust composition may of course vary along the disc , but in the present study we will , for simplicity , regard @xmath60 as a constant and the slope of @xmath69 therefore remains unchanged after the correction .",
    "the resultant dust - to - gas ratios @xmath69 and the dust - to - metals ratios @xmath70 across the disc of m31 are presented in figs .",
    "[ grad ] & [ zeta ] .",
    "the dust - to - gas gradient is clearly steeper than the metallicity gradient , which indicates there is a significant _ dust - to - metals gradient _ in the disc of m31 .",
    "one could of course argue that @xmath60 may vary such that the dust - to - metals gradient flattens out and become insignificant , but there are in fact several reasons to assume the opposite , i.e. , that @xmath60 is likely larger in the less evolved outer regions of the disc than it is in the more evolved inner regions .",
    "two possible reasons stand out .",
    "first , the enrichment of carbon ( and thus carbonaceous dust ) happens on a relatively long time - scale ( see , e.g. , the models by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of silicates to carbonaceous dust is therefore probably larger in the outer disc compared to the inner disc . since carbonaceous dust grains have larger emissivity than silicate grains , @xmath60 would ( in this scenario ) _ increase _ with galactocentric distance .",
    "secondly , any @xmath43 degeneracy would also lead to an overestimate of the dust mass density in the mid / outer disc more than in the inner disc because of the differences in the sed fitting results ( see fig . 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , @xmath60 would again _ increase _ with galactocentric distance rather than decrease , suggesting that variations in @xmath60 with metallicity is likely not responsible for the derived dust - to - gas slope . however , the higher @xmath0-values towards the inner disc may suggest the emissivity - law should be rescaled such that the overall emissivity is higher at small galactocentric distances .",
    "it is obviously not clear how @xmath60 may depend on galactocentric distance . assuming that the degree of dust overabundance @xmath60 is constant with @xmath45 is therefore both a reasonable and conservative approach .",
    "we have fitted the analytical models of dust - mass evolution derived by @xcite and @xcite , which are given in terms of the so - called confluent hypergeometric kummer - tricomi functions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also appendix  [ theory ] for further details about the models ) to the dust - to - gas profiles derived by @xcite .",
    "we combine this with a metallicity profile derived from abundances as a function of galactocentric distance ( fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] ) . here",
    "we briefly explain the parameters and the numerical routines for fitting the data sets in figs .",
    "[ grad ] & [ zeta ] with the models listed in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the model has four parameters : the effective dust yield @xmath71 , the corresponding total metal yield @xmath72 , the grain - growth efficiency @xmath73 and the dust - destruction efficiency @xmath74 .",
    "the metal yield @xmath72 needs to be fixed to the value obtained from the simple closed box model .",
    "the closed box model is of course not a correct model of how the metallicity in late - type galaxies evolve .",
    "but as discussed in @xcite , it is a model that works in this context since gas flows should not affect the _ dust - to - metals ratio _ very much . using the observed o / h gradient ( with a central value of o / h@xmath75 ) derived in this work ( equation  [ ohgrad ] ; fig .",
    "[ m31_oh ] ) and the fact that the metallicity at a galactocentric distance @xmath76 is known to be a good proxy for the typical metallicity of a galaxy disc @xcite , we have the following relationship ( which follows from the simple closed - box model of chemical evolution , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the effective metal yield , @xmath77 where @xmath2 is the global gas mass fraction of the galaxy .",
    "m31 is a mature spiral galaxy with relatively little gas left in the disc .",
    "hence , we adopt a low mean gas - mass fraction of @xmath78 , which is based on various estimates found in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath79  arcmin ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) such that @xmath80 . combined with the o / h gradient , this gives @xmath81 and thus @xmath82 .",
    "the effective stellar dust yield @xmath71 and @xmath73 are treated as free parameters .",
    "there are reasons to believe dust destruction plays a relatively minor role in the formation of a dust - to - metals gradient .",
    "this can be motivated as follows .",
    "we have seen in section [ data ] that there must be a significant dust - to - metals gradient in m31 , which indicates significant dust growth in the ism .",
    "m31 is also a galaxy where the metallicity is relatively similar across the disc and the dust - to - metals ratio may be close to unity in much of the inner parts ( inside the white circle in fig .",
    "[ dustmap ] ) , which suggests @xmath83 in equation .",
    "( [ dustz2 ] ) is small .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath84 since @xmath85 must be positive and not too small in order for a dust - to - metals gradient to emerge . in case @xmath84",
    ", it is fair to assume a model with a negligible @xmath74 , since the net effect of dust destruction would be small compared to the effect of grain growth anyway .",
    "we will therefore consider models in which @xmath86 as well as where @xmath74 is a free parameter .",
    "we also test a case where @xmath87 , which corresponds to a dust - destruction time - scale often assumed for the galaxy ( @xmath88 gyr , see * ? ? ?",
    "to compare the data and the model , we used the levenberg - markwardt scheme for @xmath89-minimization .",
    "more precisely , we used the idl - routine package mpfit @xcite in combination with a numerical implementation ( for idl ) of the kummer - tricomi functions ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the initial parameter setting is in all cases @xmath90 , @xmath91 and , where used , @xmath87 . to avoid unphysical results",
    "the parameters are forced by our fitting routine to remain non - negative numbers . in each step",
    "the fitting routine has to call a subroutine to compute the kummer - tricomi function @xmath92 for the considered argument and parameters .",
    "this may slow down the fitting considerably and even turn into a cumbersome computational effort of its own . if @xmath92 is to be computed on its integral form with high precision for any argument and parameter values , the number of iterations may in some cases be an inhibiting factor .",
    "therefore , we take a short - cut , in order to maintain a reasonable computation speed .",

    "however , we caution the reader on the uncertainty of the simplistic model we use here - conclusions about the overall efficiency of dust destruction should not be drawn from this result .",
    "the parameter values given in table [ parameters ] should be taken with a grain of salt also because the fit is intrinsically uncertain .",
    "we have tried a boot - strap monte carlo approach to estimate the ` errors ' of the fitting parameters , but due to various uncertainties in the observational data , the resultant probability density functions ( pdfs ) can not be used as constraints ( despite 10000 iterations ) .",
    "the pdfs are patchy and multi - modal functions which give no meaningful statistical variance .",
    "but it is clear that one can easily vary each parameter by at least a factor of 2 and still stay within the error bars of the data .",
    "regardless of whether we use a fixed or varying @xmath0 there is a clear dust - to - metals gradient along the disc of m31 .",
    "this is indicative of significant interstellar dust growth @xcite and we do indeed obtain relatively large @xmath73 values from the fits ( see table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the dust - to - metals ratio along the disc of spiral galaxies is typically not constant , but m31 ( with its flat metallicity distribution ) seems to have a steeper gradient than most of the sings spirals of comparable size @xcite .",
    "the same phenomenon is seen also in global dust - to - gas ratios and at lower metallicities in the recent results by @xcite .",
    "the favoured effective stellar dust yield @xmath71 is in all cases with @xmath118 quite small .",
    "naively , one would interpret that as stellar dust production being rather insignificant , but as mentioned above , the simplistic model we use can not provide very precise quantitative results due to its simplicity .",
    "the low @xmath71-values may be due to a possible degeneracy between stellar dust production and interstellar grain destruction due to sne in star - forming regions .",
    "since the helga dust map , in combination with the gas distribution , allows us to get a good handle on the kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s ) law in the m31 disc @xcite , we have an opportunity to estimate the grain - growth time - scale @xmath119 using a consistent data set . using the k - s law derived by @xcite",
    "we have calculated the growth time - scale @xmath119 from equation ( [ taugr ] ) in the same 2 kpc wide bins along the disc that we have used previously .",
    "the resultant @xmath119 as function of galactocentric distance is shown in fig .",
    "[ taugrplot ] for the cases of variable and constant emissivity index @xmath0 , respectively , and the maximum and minimum values are also listed in table [ parameters ] . as expected , because the growth time - scale @xmath119 is anti - correlated with the gas - mass density due to its implicit dependence on the star - formation efficiency ( see equations [ tau0 ] and [ taugr ] ) , there is a minimum where the gas distribution has its maximum ( at @xmath120  kpc ) , but we also see a significant rise in the inner disc .",
    "these properties are found both for the case with a free emissivity index @xmath0 and for @xmath14 , i.e. , the radial variation of the grain - growth time - scale ( according to the models ) are qualitatively the same .",
    "we note also that these grain - growth time - scales are in reasonable agreement with the results of more detailed models for the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who find @xmath121 gyr in the solar circle ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a dust - to - metals gradient can to some degree be the result of metallicity - dependent stellar dust production .",
    "more precisely , m - type giants ( on the agb ) do not produce their own raw material for dust production , which will lead to metallicity dependence .",
    "one could also argue that the inner regions should have more of evolved low - and intermediate - mass stars that have turned into carbon stars and thus alter the silicate - to - carbon - dust ratio , which in turn may affect the dust gradient we derive and cause an apparent metallicity dependence .",
    "however , both these issues are important only if a large fraction of the stellar dust is due to agb stars .",
    "since there is more and more evidence suggesting that massive stars ( which produce most of the metals ) are efficient dust producers , this is likely not the case . at very low metallicity there may be a threshold also for massive stars , though ( see the hypothesis by * ? ? ?",
    "despite it is technically possible that such metallicity dependences could lead to a dust - to - metals gradient , it can be pretty much ruled out by the result proved in appendix a in @xcite : + if the metallicity dependence of the effective stellar dust yield @xmath71 is linear ( @xmath122 ) and the dust - to - metals gradient is steeper than the metallicity gradient , then the slope of the dust - to - metals gradient can not be explained by metallicity - dependent stellar dust production . +",
    "this result is , in fact , more general than so and should hold even if @xmath71 is not linear with metallicity , and lends support to the grain - growth scenario in the present case .",
    "we note that ( compare the red dashed lines in fig . [ grad ] with the data points in fig .",
    "[ zeta ] ) the metallicity gradient of m31 is much flatter than its dust - to - metals gradient if the emissivity index @xmath0 is treated as a variable , while the difference is less if @xmath116 .",
    "thus , because of the flatness of the metallicity gradient in m31 , there is one qualitative conclusion that may be drawn from the simple model fits we present : the new helga dust map provides a good case in favour of the grain - growth scenario .      despite the relatively firm qualitative results given above",
    ", there are a couple of caveats which we have to discuss in some detail .",
    "first , we have the problem of how to treat the emissivity index @xmath0 .",
    "is it a constant or a variable ? is it covariant with other parameters ?",
    "second , sed fitting can be done using various models of the sed . are there one or two grain temperatures that dominate or should we consider a continuous range of grain temperatures ?",
    "below we try to address these issues .",
    "the dust abundance data used in this paper are mainly taken from @xcite , who choose to treat the emissivity index @xmath0 as a free parameter in their one - component sed fits , which is reasonable since @xmath0 may not be the same in every environment .",
    "however , there is a parameter degeneracy between @xmath0 and the dust temperature @xmath28 , because both affects the long - wavelength slope of the model sed ( see * ? ? ? * in particular their fig .",
    "6 ) . as one",
    "can easily see in fig .",
    "[ binned ] ( middle panel ) the mean @xmath0 values in the inner disc exceeds @xmath123 , which is the slope expected for silicate dust @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing what we have already mentioned in section [ dustandgas ] : at very low temperatures @xmath124 is possible @xcite , but , as discussed by @xcite , the @xmath0@xmath28 relation has two branches associated with the inner and outer disc in m31 .",
    "this could , in principle , be a result of the aforementioned degeneracy .",
    "if such a parameter - degeneracy problem is present , it would likely put an unphysical ( and clearly unwanted ) bias on the resultant dust abundances .",
    "therefore , we have explored both fixed and varying @xmath0 in this work .",
    "the observed seds are generally better fit with a varying @xmath0 and the emissivity index @xmath0 should indeed vary depending on the ratio of carbonaceous to silicate dust : the time - scale of carbon enrichment is significantly longer than that of silicon , magnesium , oxygen and other elements relevant for silicate formation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because it is believed that carbon is mainly produced by relatively long - lived stars that become carbon stars on the agb .",
    "this suggests @xmath0 is lower in evolved parts of a galaxy than it is in younger parts .",
    "the @xmath0-trend with galactocentric distance should thus be increasing since the outer parts are usually less evolved than the inner parts .",
    "the fact that populations of cold grains may have large @xmath0 may work against the formation of such a trend , given that the characteristic grain temperature decreases with galactocentric distance , as one may naively assume .",
    "adopting a constant @xmath0 over the whole disc may therefore not be completely unjustified and , more importantly , it appears to provide a lower limit to the steepness of the dust - to - gas gradient ( cf . figs .",
    "[ binned ] and [ binned_fixedb ] ) .",
    "fitting a one - component modified blackbody model to the sed may not be an optimal way of estimating the dust mass .",
    "the validity of such a model depends on properties of the dust components .",
    "sometimes there can indeed be a single dominant dust component consisting of grains of similar temperature , in which case a one - component modified blackbody model is a very good approximation .",
    "if there are two distinct dust populations with clearly different grains temperatures , such a model would be inadequate because a single component can not capture the characteristics of a ` bimodal ' dust - temperature distribution .",
    "but in case the sed reflects a dust component with a continuous distribution of grain temperatures , a single component is more representative than a two - component fit , which may overestimate the contribution from the coldest grains .",
    "an overestimate of the cold component will also cause an overestimate of the dust mass , since cold grains emit significantly less radiation per unit grain mass .",
    "also , the _ herschel _ data provides no information about the sed beyond @xmath125 m , which makes it difficult to constrain the contribution from the coldest dust in a multi - temperature fit . as pointed out by @xcite , to use a model containing dust at more than one temperature in a reliable way , we would require additional data at longer wavelengths , e.g. , observations at @xmath126 m with scuba2 ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the above in mind",
    ", one may see the radial dust - temperature profiles in a different light : the radial dust - temperature profile , and the anomalous double - branched @xmath127 relation in particular , does not necessarily reflect changes in the dust composition and heating sources in different parts of the disc only , but also a bias caused by assumptions about the dust temperatures underlying the sed model .",
    "the emissivity index @xmath0 is in practice just a ` shape parameter ' for the sed model , which is also the direct reason for the parameter degeneracy mentioned in section [ dtgbeta ] . in case one",
    "is trying to fit a single temperature model with a varying @xmath0 to a dust component which in reality has a continuous distribution of grain temperatures , that procedure may force @xmath0 to become smaller as the sed of a multi - temperature dust component is always wider than a single - temperature component .",
    "obviously , this effect will also lead to an incorrect estimate of the dust mass .",
    "hence , despite the high quality of the _ herschel _ data , the difficulty in finding a simple but general and adequate model for the seds in order to obtain the dust map requires that one uses the radial dust distributions presented here ( and in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with some caution .",
    "we note , however , that the slope of the dust - to - gas profile we obtained with a varying @xmath0 , agrees well with the slope of the dust - to - gas profile in the inner disc of m31 derived by @xcite using different data and sed fitting technique .",
    "our result for @xmath14 , on the other hand , is in better agreement with the outer slope of the dust - to - gas profile according to @xcite .",
    "we believe the two profiles presented here ( top panels of figs .",
    "[ binned ] and [ binned_fixedb ] ) comprises the range of variation one may expect due to the uncertainty of the sed model .",
    "we have derived and modelled distributions of dust and metals in the disc of m31 with the purpose of finding indirect evidence to hopefully distinguish between one of the two competing dust production mechanisms in late - type galaxies : stellar dust production and interstellar grain growth . the data together with simple models point towards interstellar grains growth being the most important mechanism , although firm conclusions can not be drawn due to possible degeneracies between formation and destruction of dust associated with stars .",
    "we have computed mean radial dust distributions from the helga dust map based on simple sed models with a varying as well as a fixed emissivity index @xmath0 as well as an overall metal distribution derived using data collected from the literature . in a second step , we used a simple analytical model of the evolution of the dust component in a galaxy and fit this model to the radial dust - to - gas distribution .",
    "the dust - to - gas gradient in m31 is steeper than the metallicity gradient , i.e. , there is a clear negative dust - to - metals gradient along the disc , and in such cases our model suggests dust growth must be the dominant dust - formation mechanism in the ism of m31 .",
    "taken at face value , our model fit actually suggests the net stellar dust production is almost negligible and the build - up of the dust component in m31 should therefore be dominated by interstellar growth .    from the above we",
    "conclude that m31 is a strong case for cosmic dust being the result of substantial interstellar grain growth , while the net stellar dust production must be limited .",
    "the efficiency of dust production in stars ( most notably sne ) and the grain destruction in the ism may be degenerate , however . consequently , we can only conclude that interstellar grain growth by accretion is _ at least _ as important as stellar dust production channels in building the cosmic dust component in nearby galaxies . however , our result is in line with the recent ( and more detailed ) dust - evolution models of late - type dwarf galaxies by @xcite , which favours low condensation efficiencies in type ii sne combined with substantial grain growth in the ism .",
    "thus , it seems worthwhile to construct a detailed model of the radial dust distribution of m31 , which is more independent of the metallicity gradient .",

    "in the present paper we use the analytical closed - box model described in @xcite , which is based on the equation @xmath128 where @xmath45 and @xmath69 are the metals - to - gas ( metallicity ) and dust - to - gas ratios , respectively , @xmath129 is the dust destruction time scale , @xmath119 is the interstellar dust - growth time scale and @xmath71 , @xmath72 denote the yields ( dust and metals , respectively , as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite the dust destruction time - scale can be parameterized as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the effective gas mass cleared of dust by each sn event , and @xmath132 is the sn rate .",

    "* ) which can be regarded as an upper limit @xcite .",
    "the dust - destruction efficiency @xmath74 can also be calibrated to the expected dust - destruction timescale for the galaxy , which one can assume is approximately 0.7gyr @xcite .",
    "given that the effective galactic gas - consumption rate is @xmath138 , and the gas density is @xmath139 , which implies @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , one can modify this timescale so that the indirect effects of grain shattering are included .",
    "small grains tend to be more easily destroyed @xcite and it is therefore reasonable to assume the dust destruction time scale should depend on the amount of grain shattering as well .",
    "the shattering rate is to first order proportional to the square of the dust - grain density in the ism .",
    "thus , we may approximate the destruction time scale with the expression @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the present - day galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the timescale of grain growth can thus be expressed as ( see @xcite ] ) : @xmath143 where , to first order , @xmath144 is essentially just a simple function of the metallicity and the growth rate of the stellar component , i.e. , @xmath145 where @xmath73 is a free parameter of the model .    adopting the above scenario , with the dust - destruction timescale defined as in eq .",
