    "our numerical results suggest that , for the shortest path , dmp holds at least in the scaling limit .",

    "the second result we can expect if sle is established for the shortest path is conformal invariance .",

    "in addition , we obtained the same estimate of @xmath14 by extracting the driving function in chordal and dipolar space .",
