    "it is known that the integral quantization of the hall conductivity can be understood as resulting from topological features underlying the quantum hall systems @xcite . the first convincing argument in this direction",
    "was given by laughlin for a system with cylindrical geometry @xcite and was refined in subsequent works considering the case of non - interacting charges carriers ( electrons ) in a periodic potential @xcite , then further exented to take into account quantum hall systems with disorder and/or interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the kubo formula giving rise to the hall conductivity can be expressed in term of the integral of the first chern class of a certain line vector bundle , stemming from the fact that in the quantum mechanical description of these systems two parameters submitted to some periodic conditions can be singled out or introduced .",
    "attempts to explain the observed fractionnal quantization of the hall conductivity have also appeared in which basically the above ( topological ) scheme is further combined with additional ( physical ) plausible assumptions , for instance the existence of a degeneracy of the ground state of the system together with the existence of a gap above it and/or the validity of averaging the hall conductivity over gauge parameters @xcite .    in most instance , the above topological approach does not permit one to really predict the value for the hall conductivity starting from basic ingredients pertaining to the quantum mechanocal description of the systems .",
    "this feature may reflect the fact that the line vector bundle which shows up at an essential step of the approach does not ( in most cases ) retain a sufficient amount of the physical properties shared by the real experiments , such as the geometry of the experimental sample , the number of charges carriers @xmath1 , the applied magnetic field @xmath2  note that many of the quantum mechanical models introduced so far in the topological approach for the quantum hall effect somehow rely on assumptions made on some of the characteristics of the experiment , such as for instance torus @xcite or annular geometry @xcite for the two dimensional sample , which prove convenient to carry on the whole analysis but are sometime questionnable regarding the actual experimental situation .",
    "ultimately , it would be desirable to incorporate into a single framework all the geometrical and physical constraints of the real experiments , control the validity of the hypothesis currently made on the applicability of the kubo formula ( in particular prove the existence of a gap in the hamiltonian spectrum ) , study the possible degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "this would permit one in particular to determine clearly whether the observed fractionnal quantization of the hall conductivity can be explainedm as the integral quantization , in terms of topological properties underlying the hall systems or relies on non topological ( additionnal ) features .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we considered a hall system whose geometry , already introduced in @xcite , mimics the one for the real experiments , namely a rectangular sample whose edges are connected by wires ( see fig .  [ fig - general ] of section  [ previousresults ] ) .",
    "this system was assumed to obey general boundary conditions compatible with current and charge conservation and which may account for the respective quantum and classical nature of the electrons inside the sample and those circulating in the wires .",
    "we have introduced and discussed a mathematical framework allowing us to treat properly some quantum mechanical aspects specific to the present system with finite size sample and general boundary conditions .",
    "these latter in particular force the representation of the considered abstract operator algebra to be reducible .",
    "the relevant representation are found to be indexed by two real numbers ( defined modulo @xmath5 ) forming some `` reciprocical '' space that permits one to obtain from the hamiltonian the velocity operators appearing in the kubo formula .",
    "the represenation space has been shown , in turn , to be ( continuously ) decomposable into representaions of a unitary symmetry which connects translations acting _ at the same time _ on the reciprocical space and on the `` direct '' space built from the physical sample . in @xcite , we have found that when @xmath0 takes any integer value , noticeable geometrical structures emerge both in the direct and the reciprocical space : the wave functoins , extended to the whole @xmath6-plan , can be interpreted as sections of a line vector bundle over a torus living in the direct space which is rigidely linked through the above unitary symmetry to a line vector bundle over a torus living in the reciprocical space whose ( integral of ) first chern class appears in the kubo formula .",
    "thanks to this correspondance , this latter formula can be explicitely calculated and we found that the hall conductivity can take integer and fractionnal values .    when @xmath0 differs from integer values , the situation becomes far more complicated .",
    "it appears that the natural problem to be solved is to determine at least what geometrical structure ( if any ) , that could be used to calculate physical quantities , would survive when @xmath0 is not integer .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ previousresults ] , we summarize the main results obtained in @xcite and collect the relevant material that will be used in the analysis . the section  [ generalcase ] is devoted to a characterization of the space on which monovaluated wave functions can be construted for arbitrary ( not integer ) @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is irrational , we find that the space is a tree corresponding to the graph of a free group with two generators and can ve identified with the universal covering space of @xmath7 . in section  [ rationnalcase ] , we consider the case where @xmath0 takes any irreducible rational value @xmath8 . using the van  kampen theorem , we find that the relevant space on which monovaluated wave functions exist is a riemann surface with @xmath9 punctures and genus @xmath10 .",
    "the complete proof is rather involved and is presented in the appendix .",
    "we further discuss under which circumstances the analysis presented in @xcite for @xmath0 integer can be extended to rationnal values of @xmath0 .",
    "when the extension can be performed , we find that the hall conductivity still takes integer or fractionnal values . in section  [ physicalcomments ] ,",
    "we discuss from a phenomenological viewpoint a situation when @xmath0 differs slightly from a rationnal value .",
    "the combinations of the fundamental boundary relations for the wave functions with some plausible physical assumptions , in particular the one stating that the geometrical structures exhibited in the pure rationnal case ( for which the computation of the hall conductivity is possible ) would survive to the introduction of a sufficiently weak disorder , suggests the existence of an infinite set of domains in the disorder - filling factor plan whose architecture is reminiscent to the global phase diagram from the quantum hall effect proposed in @xcite .",
    "finally we summarize the results and conclude .",
    "in this section , we summarize the results obtained in our previous work @xcite , hereafter refered as ( i ) , and collect some usefull properties of the corresponding mathematical framework that will be usefull in the sequel . in ( i ) , we considered a spinless multiparticle landau type hamiltonian on a finite two - dimensional domain .",
    "the hamiltonian can be expressed in the symmetric gauge as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) denote the coordinates ( resp .",
    "momentum components ) of the particle @xmath14 with mass @xmath15 , @xmath2 is the external magnetic field applied to the system and @xmath16 represents a two body interaction potential",
    ". the corresponding finite domain was assumed in ( i ) to be @xmath17 ^ 2 = [ 0,1 ] \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , that is , a unit square on the @xmath6 plane .",
    "furthermore , the boundary conditions we imposed on this quantum mechanical system were motivated by the geometry of the quantum hall effect , as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] , where _ classical _ currents circulate in wires connecting apposite edges of the square while no charge accumulation on any edge is possible . as shown in ( i ) , by using the conservation of the currents circulating in the wires together with the absence of charge accumulation on the edges , the computation of the transverse ( hall ) conductivity can be performed in extenso from the kubo formula provided a quantization condition on the product of the number of charge carriers @xmath1 by the external magnetic field @xmath2 is satisfied .",
    "namely , one must have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is any integer .",
    "keeping in mind that the physical quantities we are interested in ( such as the hall conductivity ) depend only on the collective motion of the @xmath1 charge carriers , we introduce the following variables    @xmath20    @xmath21    for @xmath22 , where ( [ collective ] ) ( resp .",
    "( [ internal ] ) ) define the collective ( resp .",
    "`` internal '' ) variables and ( [ internal ] ) satisfy the relations @xmath23    in these variables , the hamiltonian ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) can be splitted into two parts as    @xmath24    and @xmath25 depends only on the `` internal '' variables .",
    "the hilbert space on which this hamiltonian acts is itself decomposed into @xmath26 . in the following , we will mainly deal with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath28 looks like @xmath29 ^ 2)$ ] ( for the variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) but this identification is not correct as shown in ( i ) . due to the classical nature of the currents in the wires , the representation of the algebra generated by the operators",
    "@xmath32 is reducible .",
    "indeed , in order to define the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we have to specify their domain in the hilbert space .",
    "taking into account the various physical and mathematical constraints , in particular the hypothesis about the geometry of the system depicted on fig .",

    "notice that in the following we will work with any real values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , knowing that two values differing by @xmath5 label the same representation .",
    "the arbitrariness in these parameters force us to consider them _ all at once_. then , as discussed in ( i ) , the hilbert space @xmath28 is the direct sum of the hilbert spaces associated to each individual values of the couple @xmath40 . because each representation indexed by @xmath40 takes place in the hilbert space @xmath29 ^ 2)$ ]",

    "we denote by @xmath42 a general wave function in @xmath28 and @xmath43 the common domain of definition of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath28 . as shown in ( i ) , any function @xmath44 satisfies the boundary conditions    [ boundarypsi12 ] @xmath45    these boundary conditions will play a central role in the analysis presented in the next sections , and we will refer to them as the _ fundamental boundary relations_. from now on , the @xmath46 space will be called the direct space while the @xmath40 space will be called the reciprocical space . notice the this terminilogy is somehow inherited from solid state physics since in the present analysis , the variables @xmath40 look very much like conjugate variables to @xmath46 .",
    "let us now recall the situation in the special case where @xmath47 , where @xmath19 is an integer , hereafter called the integer case .",
    "in this situation , the wave functions @xmath44 can be extended to the whole plane @xmath48 by the relations @xmath49 notice that this extension requires explicitely that @xmath47 is verified , otherwise , an extra phase factor would appear in the wave function when one follows the path @xmath50 .",
    "now , for fixed values @xmath51 ) , the extended functions @xmath52 can be interpreted as sections of a line vector bundle over a torus in the variables @xmath46 ( of periodicity @xmath53 in @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this identification was a crucial point in our explicit computation of the hall conductivity performed in ( i ) .",
    "indeed , our computation made use of the kubo formula in term of the chern number of a line vector bundle over the reciprocical space @xmath40 @xcite ( this space being a torus of periodicity @xmath5 in our case ) .",
    "thanks to some symmetries in our system which combine some translations on the two torus _ at the same time _ , it was possible to caracterise this last line vector bundle over the torus in the variables @xmath40 using the structure of the line vector bundle over the torus in the variables @xmath46 .",
    "notice also that in this case , the wave functions @xmath54 can have any values at the point @xmath55 and need not to vanish , contrary to the general case .",
    "we refer to ( i ) for details of the computation .",
    "in this section , we study some features of the direct space when @xmath56 takes an arbitrary value . as we will see , the situation is far more complicated than the `` integer '' case @xmath57 .",
    "our starting point are the fundamental boundary relations ( [ boundarypsi1 ] ) and ( [ boundarypsi2 ] ) which caracterize the domain @xmath58 .    as in the integer case",

    "unfortunately , they do not necessary coincide there !",
    "indeed , for @xmath72 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , a straighforward computation using the above definitions yields    @xmath82    thus , we have @xmath83 when @xmath56 is not a multiple of @xmath5 , these two functions differ from each other by an extra phase factor .",
    "this therefore leads to _ two _ different extensions of @xmath54 on the square @xmath84 \\times [ 1,2]$ ] .",
    "notice that the choice of the square @xmath84 \\times [ 1,2]$ ] is arbitrary in this conclusion .",
    "finally , a straighforward computation shows that @xmath81 and @xmath78 satisfy the boundary relations    @xmath85    which are equivalent to ( [ boundarypsivx ] ) and ( [ boundarypsihy ] ) respectively .",
    "let us now generalize this construction . let @xmath86 be a given extension of @xmath54 on a domain @xmath87 $ ] for an integer @xmath88 , with some boundary relations of the form ( [ boundarypsihy ] ) relating @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",

    "then , starting from the `` fundamental '' square @xmath17 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , it is possible to define an extension of @xmath54 on any square @xmath96 \\times [ n , n+1]$ ] in the plane",
    ". unfortunately , the value of this extension _ depends _ on the path used to go from the fundamental square to the final square .",
    "for instance , on fig .",
    "[ fig - path ] , two extensions in two steps are possible from the fundamental square ( in black ) to the target square ( in grey ) : a first extension @xmath81 , for which the first step in an horizontal extension ( @xmath63 ) and the second step is vertical , and a second extension , @xmath78 , for which the first step is vertical ( @xmath71 ) and the second horizontal . on the grey square , there is a phase difference between @xmath81 and @xmath78 .",
    "some elementary computation shows that this phase difference is of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the area ( evaluated in term of the number of squares ) limited by the interior of the two paths joining the black square to the grey square used to define the two extensions @xmath81 and @xmath78 . in ( [ phase1 ] ) , this area is just @xmath53 .",
    "note that if the grey square is located at @xmath96 \\times [ n , n+1]$ ] in @xmath6 , one has @xmath99 .     can be extended on the four stripes as @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath81 and @xmath78 , but on the grey square , @xmath81 and @xmath78 do not necessary coincide .",
    "the phase difference between them is of the form @xmath102 where @xmath98 is the area ( counted in number of squares ) enclosed by the stripes . ]",
    "this `` area rule '' can be easily generalized to any path used to extend @xmath54 from the fundamental square to any target square .",
    "this rule will play a very important role in the following .",
    "since the extensions are multivalued , the space on which we want to introduce them can not be @xmath6 .",
    "the correct space on which an unique extension of @xmath54 can be defined is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig - tree ] . in this ( infinite )",
    "tree representation , the squares have been shrunk to vertices , and the links connecting these vertices indicate that two squares are adjacent .    , represents the direct space one can use to define a monovalued extension of the wave function @xmath44 . ]",
    "this tree is constructed from the fundamental square ( with removed corners ) , representented by the vertex at the center , by connecting four squares ( with removed corners ) at its four edges , and then by iterating this proceduce on any new introduced square , with the important rule that none of these squares are identified with any other , even if they have the same location in @xmath6 . in the representation of fig .",
    "[ fig - tree ] , at each step , a scale factor has been applied to avoid some overlapping . if one tries to represent this construction with squares and without any scale factor , one need at least a 3-dimensionnal representation , in which each square in @xmath6 is replaced by a stacking of an infinite number of copies .",
    "even the fundamental square is replaced by an infinite number of copies .",
    "mathematically , this tree corresponds to the graph of a two generators free group .",
    "one of these generators acts by translation in one direction , and the other as a translation in the orthogonal direction .",
    "this space is also the universal covering space of @xmath7 , the space @xmath6 where all the points with integer coordinates has been removed .",
    "we will denote by @xmath103 this covering space .",
    "then we have a projection map @xmath104 , and the inverse image of any square ( without corners ) @xmath105\\times [ n , n+1])$ ] is an infinite number of squares , which we will call the `` covering squares '' of @xmath96\\times [ n , n+1]$ ] .",
    "this last caracterization makes @xmath103 the right space to extend the wave functions @xmath44 into a wave function @xmath106 on @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath44 , we have introduced a procedure to extend @xmath54 on any square in @xmath7 .",
    "this extension depends on the path used to build @xmath54 step by step starting from the fundamental square and going to the final square .",
    "because in the universal covering space of @xmath7 two such paths never meet , we can extend @xmath54 without ambiguities into a monovaluated wave function @xmath106 on @xmath103 .",
    "notice that each path connecting two squares can be decomposed into a ordered family of elementary translation on @xmath103 ( which goes from one square to one of its adjacent squares ) .",
    "these elementary translations are representation of the two generators of a free group .",
    "this explain why @xmath103 is related to such a group .    when @xmath56 is of the form @xmath107 for an _ irrationnal _ @xmath108 ( which we call the `` irrationnal case '' in the following ) , the area rule tells us that the phase difference for the values of the extended wave function on two squares covering a square in @xmath7 is never a multiple of @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath106 on the covering squares in any stack are always different ( except if @xmath106 vanishes there ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath56 is of the form @xmath110 , for any rationnal @xmath111 ( the `` rationnal case '' ) , the phase difference can be a multiple of @xmath109 if the area is a multiple of @xmath112 .",
    "it is desirable to identify two squares when the values of the extension of @xmath54 coincide on them .",
    "this is the purpose of the next section .",
    "in this section , we assume that @xmath113 where @xmath111 is an irreducible rationnal number . when @xmath113 , it appears that the relevant space on which a monovalued extension of the wave function @xmath54 is defined is smaller than @xmath103 . this space is obtained from @xmath103 by identifying some covering squares by using a simple rule that will be explained in a while .",
    "this space is a compact riemann surface on which some points are removed ( punctures ) , and depends only on the integer @xmath112 .",
    "we turn now on the complete characterisation of these surfaces .",
    "recall that the main motivation for introducing @xmath103 was to obtain a monovaluated extension @xmath106 of @xmath44 .",
    "as already noticed in section  [ generalcase ] , the space @xmath103 is well suited to deal with the irrational case and can not be reduced to a smaller one . in the present case @xmath113 ,",
    "the situation is somehow different because the values of the extension of @xmath54 on differents covering squares over the same square in @xmath7 can be equal .",
    "for instance , the values of the functions @xmath81 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig - path ] coincide when @xmath114 is a multiple of @xmath112 .",
    "we identify two covering squares over the same square in @xmath7 when the values of @xmath106 are equal on them ( for any @xmath44 ) .",
    "then , using the area rule , it is easy to show that the number of covering squares after this identification has been performed is exactly @xmath112 .",
    "we denote by @xmath115 the corresponding space which is a @xmath112-fold covering of @xmath7 , and is no longer simply connected .",
    "let us illustrate the situation in the simplest case @xmath116 , as shown in the left graphic of fig .",
    "[ fig - k2 ] . there , four squares in @xmath7 are considered .",
    "each one has two covering squares , represented by the four stacks of two squares .",
    "a link connecting two squares means that these two squares are adjacents .",
    "notice that starting with the top - upper - left square , and following the links , we have to go round _ twice _ in order to come back , which illustrates the area rule .",
    "obviously , @xmath117 is composed of an infinity of such stacks of two squares , and the links which connect these squares .    now , on @xmath115 , it is easy to show that the extended wave function @xmath106 satisfy the boundary relations    @xmath118    because the phases `` @xmath67 '' or `` @xmath119 '' ( see for instance formula ( [ boundarypsivhy ] ) and ( [ boundarypsihvx ] ) ) are exactly @xmath120 when @xmath121 and then can be eliminated . with these boundary relations ,",
    "it is possible to interpret @xmath106 as a section of a line vector bundle over a manifold that we describe now .",
    "these boundary relations reveal a periodicity in the variable @xmath30 and @xmath31 of length @xmath112 .",
    "this means that @xmath115 can be reduced by identifying the extreme edges of any stripe of length @xmath112 ( @xmath112 adjacent squares in the same direction ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath122 the manifold obtained from @xmath115 by these identifications .",
    "for instance , for @xmath116 , this means that the left edge of the upper - left square is identified with the right edge of the upper - right square ( the two squares being on top of their stack ) . performing this identification for any square",
    ", one obtains the middle graphic of fig .",
    "[ fig - k2 ] , where the squares have been shrunk to some points , and the curved links represent these last identifications .",
    "the last graphic on the left represents an unfold version , which is topologically equivalent to @xmath123 .    : a @xmath124 extract of @xmath117 on the left , @xmath123 in the middle and on the right . ]    for @xmath125 , it is still possible to represent graphically these steps , as done in fig .",

    "the extension to the general situation where @xmath122 , @xmath142 , comes into play , becomes extremely more complicated even for @xmath116 , so that a direct computation based on the kubo formula would be untractable .",
    "however , this technical difficulty can be partially overcome as we will see in a while .    as explained above , the riemann surface @xmath122 is constructed by gluing @xmath129 copies of the `` fundamental square '' which is nothing but the real physical sample involved in the experiment submitted to the external magnetic field .",
    "however , @xmath122 is just a mathematical tool which indicates that the relevant wave functions , as sections of some line vector bundle , must satisfy some phase coherence on a distance larger that the length of the real physical sample ( because @xmath122 is constructed from @xmath112 copies of the fundamental square in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions ) .",
    "this last observation will be examined more closely in the next section .    the total magnetic flux through the fundamental square is @xmath140 ( as seen by the center of mass of the system ) .",
    "this means that @xmath122 is submitted a flux @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath122 were closed ( without punctures ) , this outgoing flux could only be produced by a monopole inside the riemann surface .",
    "but thanks to the presence of @xmath9 punctures , this flux can penetrate into the surface , each puncture carrying a penetrating flux of @xmath144 .    due to the complexity of @xmath122 , the direct computation of the transverse conductivity from a kubo formula can not be performed so that one has to evaluate it with an other method . using simple arguments and natural physical hypothesis ,",
    "it is possible to rely the computation of @xmath141 to the result we have obtained in ( i ) .",
    "indeed , the relation @xmath140 can be written as @xmath145 .",
    "this can be interpreted as stemming from a system with @xmath146 charge carriers in the magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian for these @xmath146 particules is the direct sum of @xmath112 copies of the hamiltonian ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) . in this new hamiltonian",
    ", the charge carriers in differents copies do not interact .",
    "this means that the interaction potential is not exactly the same as the one used in ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the computation of @xmath141 performed in ( i ) , the _ explicit _ expression for the potential was needed when calculating @xmath141 : only some gap properties were assumed in order ensure the validity of the kubo formula .",
    "let us now make the natural physical hypothesis that the new potential has the properties needed for the kubo formula to be used . then , because the relation @xmath145 holds , the use of formula ( 45 ) of ( i ) , yields @xmath147 now , the conductivity for @xmath146 charge carriers is @xmath112 times the conductivity of @xmath1 charge carriers : @xmath148 . then one has @xmath149 as expected , provided the physical hypothesis made on the potential are valid , the result coincides with the one obtained in ( i ) .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that for all the rational values of @xmath150 , says @xmath151 , the transverse conductivity @xmath152 takes integers or fractionnal values while the wave functions in @xmath43 are rigidily linked with the topological and geometrical structures .",
    "the purpose of this section is to discuss heuristically what additionnal physical information could be extracted from these mathematical structures when @xmath150 differs from a rational value , taking into account some plausible physical assumptions .",
    "one of the main features of the real quantum hall experiments is the occurence of plateaux in the transverse conductivity when @xmath2 varies while no plateau can show up within the system described by fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] and ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) ( plus boundary conditions ) that we have analysed up to now , since @xmath152 is linear in @xmath2 for all the rational values of @xmath150 .",
    "consider the case of integer qhe .",
    "then , it is believed that charge carriers are localized by disorder effects ( which are basically induced by the presence of impurities in the hall sample ) .",
    "this can be shown in landau type models on @xmath6 in which the localized states modify the hamiltonian spectrum . at least in a weak disorder regime ,",
    "for which the typical energy of the disorder potential is small compared to the cyclotron energy , each landau level is broadened by disorder giving rise to a landau band associated with an extended state with energy centered around the corresponding landau energy .",
    "now , when @xmath2 varies in such a way that the system stays in such a band , the number of states involved in the charge transport remains constant so that the resulting conductivity is constant .",
    "a rigourous extension of the present analysis to take into account the disorder effects through the introduction of a suitable random potential in ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) is a task that goes beyond the scope of the present paper . in the following",
    ", we will not perform a mathematical analysis but instead we will propose a heuristic scenario which might correspond to the situation with non zero disorder , introducing for this purpose some plausible assumptions . the main point underlying our discussion",
    "has in fact been implicitely suggested in @xcite .",
    "in fact , these autors gave convincing arguments suggesting that in the presence of disorder the system retains ( a sufficient amount of its ) underlying geometrical structure so that the transverse conductivity remains quantized . keeping this in mind , let us assume that the following two hypothesis are valid :    i ) : :    the geometrical structures exhibited in the previous sections for    rational values of @xmath150 are not altered when a weak    disorder potential is incorporated so that disorder effects would    manifest themselves in the boundary conditions for the wave functions    as phase changes compensating deviations of @xmath150    from its rational values .",
    "ii ) : :    the wave function @xmath153 for    non zero disorder are related to those at zero disorder through a    phase change @xmath154 as @xmath155    which is suggested by scattering theory .    now , in a weak disorder regime , the phase change @xmath156 in ( [ phase ] ) can be expected to be close to unity , @xmath157 , so that @xmath154 can be parametrized by @xmath158 where the integer @xmath108 depends on the location @xmath46 and @xmath159 is bounded : @xmath160 . in the spirit of hypothesis",
    "i ) , @xmath161 represents the upper value of the disorder contribution for which the geometrical structures exhibited in the previous sections are preserved giving rise to a quantized transverse conductivity . then using ( [ phase ] ) , the boundary conditions ( [ boundarypsitorus1])([boundarypsitorus2 ] ) on the wave functions relevant for the case @xmath150 integer must be given by :    @xmath162    then , @xmath163 can be extended in a unique way on the whole @xmath6 plane provided @xmath164 or @xmath165 since one has @xmath160 , ( [ extensioncondition ] ) gives rise to the range of variations for @xmath0 around an integer value for which , according to hypothesis i ) , the transverse conductivity is quantized ; namely , one obtains @xmath166 ) becomes @xmath167 in view of ( [ inequalityfraction ] ) , the main assumptions i ) , if finally correct , leads to the physical conclusions that the transverse conductivity stays fixed to its quantized value ( [ sigmaxy ] ) for @xmath2 varying in the range @xmath168 $ ] for fixed @xmath1 , which clearly can be viewed as a plateau",
    ".    the use of formula ( [ inequalityinteger ] ) permits one to obtain some insight into the global behavior of the physical system studied in this paper when @xmath2 is varied and the contribution stemming from the disorder comes into play . recall that @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the number of magnetic fluxes through the sample and that in our units , @xmath171 so that @xmath172 .",
    "let us assume that the number of electrons @xmath1 is kept fixed to some value , says @xmath173 . then , from the analysis of section  [ rationnalcase ] , we know that when @xmath2 reaches the value @xmath174 , the transverse conductivity must be @xmath175 for integer or fractional @xmath176 .",
    "now , according to the analysis presented at the beginning of this section , the occurence of disorder will not modify the value for the transverse conductivity , @xmath177 , provided @xmath178 still holds , where @xmath179 and the expression for @xmath180 together with the definition of the filling factor @xmath181 have been used .",
    "then , one concludes from ( [ inequality ] ) that each value for @xmath182 corresponds to a domain in the @xmath183 plane whose associated state has transverse conductivity equal to @xmath184 .",
    "such a domain would therefore represent a phase in the @xmath183 plane which could be fully characterized from the properties of its corresponding wave function and energy derived from the hamiltonian ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) enlarged with a disorder potential . in particular , this would permits one to compare the respective energies of states corresponding to the ( partially ) overlapping stemming from ( [ inequality ] ) in the @xmath183 plane in order to determine which state is energically favored with respect to the other ones , therefore removing the spurious physically meaningless overlaps .",
    "unfortunately , the full corresponding schrdinger problem can not be explicitely solved in the present case .    besides",
    ", we further note that the value of the transverse conductivity we have found is twice the value which is expected in realistic quantum hall experiments .",
    "we have carefully checked that this factor 2 does appear when calculating _ in extenso _ the conductivity through the kubo formula for the system depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] involving spinless charged particles and submitted to the boundary conditions ( [ boundarypsi12 ] ) .",
    "stricto sensu , realistic quantum hall systems involve spin carrying electrons in a strong magnetic field and are therefore somehow different than the idealized system considered here for which the magnitude of the magnetic field seen by the spinless charge carriers is not specified .",
    "it is concevable that the extension of the present study to the case of charge carriers with spin may lead , in some strong magnetic field limit , to some mechanism and/or degeneracy of the ground state that triggers the compensation of the above mentionned factor 2 . if we assume that this finally happens , then eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) now becomes @xmath185 where @xmath186 has been defined above and is associated with the disorder .",
    "consider now the following odd denominator states @xmath187 for which the corresponding energies @xmath188 have been evaluated to be such that @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "this , combined with ( [ inequality2 ] ) suggests the phase architecture in the @xmath183 plane depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig-3phases ] . in this figure",
    ", we have used the plausible assumption that when two domains overlap , the indexing stable state corresponds to the one with lowest energy .",
    "it can be checked that successive actions of the landau shift operator @xmath190 and of the flux attachment operator @xmath191 generate a phase diagram similar to the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "plane for the 3 states @xmath187 . ]    within the mathematical formalism introduced in ( i ) , salient geometrical structures appear , depending on the values reached by the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "these structures control possibly the ( integral or fractionnal ) quantization of the hall conductivity .",
    "the simplest situation corresponds to integer values for @xmath0 and gives rise , as shown in ( i ) , to a hall conductivity taking integer or fractionnal values . in the present paper",
    ", we have analysed some of the main ( new ) geometrical features underlying the hall system described in section  [ previousresults ] in the more complicated situation where @xmath0 differs from an integer , paying special attention to the geometrical characterization of the space on which monovaluated wave functions can be defined .",
    "when @xmath0 takes a rational value @xmath8 , this space is a riemann surface that we have completely determined in term of the number of punctures and genus , both related to the denominator of the rational value .",
    "provided the potential satisfies an additional condition , the explicit computation of the kubo formula performed in ( i ) when @xmath0 is integer can be extended to rational values for @xmath0 and gives rise again to hall conductivity taking integer or fractionnal values .",
    "when @xmath0 is irrationnal , we have found that the above space can be related to the graph of a free group with two generators . in that latter case",
    "however , the ( explicit ) computation of the kubo formula can not be performed .",
    "finally , we have discussed from a phenomenological viewpoint what might be expected for a hall system with @xmath0 differing slightly from a rational value .",
    "we presented some physical arguments suggesting that interesting physical features ( to be extracted ) should be encoded in our formalism .",
    "this suggests to examine more closely the irrationnal case and in particular to determine how the geometrical structures that occur in the rationnal case evolve when @xmath0 differs from rationnal values .",
    "presumably , those `` deformations '' should be better treated within an algebraic framework .",
    "we notice that an indication in this direction are already encoded in the unitary symmetries that we have exhibited in ( i ) .",
    "recall that these latter connect rigidely ( structures in ) the direct space to ( structures in ) the reciprocical space . besides , the two operators generated the unitary symmetries bear some similarity with the irrationnal rotation algebra , the @xmath192-algebra introduced in @xcite . as indicated in ( i ) and in the present paper , in the direct space quantization of @xmath0",
    "relies on the existence of some geometrical fiber bundle , while in the reciprocical space , the quantization of the hall conductance stemms from some geometrical counterpart fiber bundle that is induced by the unitary symmetries .",
    "now , from an algebraic viewpoint , this is strongly reminiscent of @xmath193-theory in direct space connected to @xmath193-theory in reciprocical space .",
    "but a natural framework to deal with both @xmath193-theories _ at the same time _ is provided by the @xmath194-theory of kasparov ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding implications are presently under study .",
    "in this appendix , we characterize the riemann surface with puncture @xmath122 introduced in section  [ rationnalcase ] .",
    "the only missing information about this surface is its genus : from its construction , one knows that it is orientable , without boundary and with @xmath9 punctures . a elegant way to calculate",
    "its genus is to compute its first homotopy group @xmath195 . indeed , using standard techniques in algebraic topology and the well known theorem of van  kampen",
    ", one can easily rely the genus @xmath196 , the number of punctures @xmath197 and the number of generators @xmath88 of the group @xmath195 by the formula @xmath198 in order to get @xmath196 , we only need to compute the number of generators of @xmath195 .",
    "this can be done using the van  kampen theorem .",
    "recall that this theorem permits one to compute the first homotopy group of a space @xmath199 using a decomposition @xmath200 , where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are open , nonempty and arcwise connected , by the relation @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the free group amalgation of the group @xmath205 by @xmath206 over a group @xmath59 when there exists two morphisms @xmath207 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the complete definition .",
    "we will make use of this formula when @xmath208 is trivial , which means that the product is a free product .",
    "this means that the number of generators of @xmath209 is the sum of the number of generators of @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the idea to compute @xmath195 is to reconstruct the space @xmath122 by adding , step by step , the @xmath129 squares from which it is composed .",
    "the first space we take is a circle , composed of the @xmath212 peripherical squares of the @xmath9 stacks . as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig - k2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - k3 ] , the links connecting these squares form a global circle .",
    "this property is easily demonstrated using the area rule .",

    "[ fig - computation ] .",
    "the shell labeled by @xmath213 is the one just described , composed of @xmath212 squares .",
    "the next one , labeled by @xmath214 , is composed of @xmath215 stacks , which gives @xmath216 squares .",
    "the shell labeled @xmath217 is composed of @xmath218 stacks , and @xmath219 squares . the last internal shell depends on the parity of @xmath112 : for @xmath112 odd it constains @xmath53 stack of @xmath112 squares , and for @xmath112 even , @xmath136 stacks . in the odd case , we will not consider the last shell as the one containing only @xmath53 stack , because it plays a different role in the following computation , but the one just before , containing @xmath133 stacks , which corresponds to @xmath220 . in the even case",
    ", the last shell corresponds to @xmath221 .",
    "this means also that we have to consider @xmath222 in the following analysis .",
    "let us now explain the reconstruction method .",
    "in the first step , we take @xmath223 to be the circle composed of the @xmath212 peripherical squares . first , we wish to add a square in the corner of the shell @xmath214 .",
    "this square is connected to the shell @xmath213 by two links , as symbolised on fig .",
    "[ fig - computation ] . notice that these two links do not connect the square to the same level in the stacks of the shell @xmath213 .",
    "it is possible to close these links along the shell @xmath213 , and then the space @xmath16 we take is just topologically a circle .",
    "when the four squares in the corner of the shell @xmath214 has been added , one can add the other squares one by one exactly by the same procedure . at each step the space @xmath223 is growing , and the space @xmath16 is topologically equivalent to a circle .",
    "we can repeat this procedure for all the shells .",
    "one has also to add the external links connected to the shell @xmath213 , which are also topologically some circles .",
    "let us compute the number of generators of the first homotopy group from this construction using the van  kampen theorem .",
    "at each step , the space @xmath16 is a circle , which means that @xmath211 has one generator , and the intersection @xmath224 is contractible , which means that @xmath208 is trivial .",
    "then at each step , the free group amalgation consists to add exactly one generator to the homotopy group . in order to get the number of generators of @xmath195",
    ", one has to compute the number of circles one has to add to reconstruct @xmath122 from the original circle .    the shell @xmath213 .",

    "each square in this stack is    connected to @xmath136 squares of the previous shell ( see for    instance the left graph of fig .",
