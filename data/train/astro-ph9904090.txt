    "the formation of stellar clusters is yet an unsolved problem of theoretical astrophysics .",
    "clusters form in giant molecular clouds complexes on time scales of order @xmath4 yrs ( carpenter et al .",
    "1997 , hillenbrand , 1997 ) .",
    "this time scale is similar to the dynamical time scale of the clouds , it is however one order of magnitude shorter than the inferred cloud lifetime ( blitz & shu 1980 ) .",
    "the mechanisms that stabilize molecular clouds for such a long time are not well understood .",
    "turbulence has been proposed to stir clouds , supporting them against gravitational collapse ( arons & max 1975 ) . indeed",
    ", molecular emission lines tend to be an order of magnitude broader than the thermal linewidth ( blitz 1993 ) , indicating supersonic velocities .",
    "magnetic fields have been detected by direct measurements of field strength in some star forming regions ( myers & goodman 1988 , crutcher et al .",
    "1993 & 1999 , crutcher 1999 , see however verschuur 1995a , b ) and may affect the cloud dynamics and stability .",
    "recent simulations suggest that freely decaying turbulence dissipates its kinetic energy on time scales shorter than a dynamical time scale ( gammie & ostriker 1996 , mac low et al .",
    "1998 , stone , ostriker & gammie 1998 ) , regardless of the adopted equation of state or the presence of magnetic fields . in order to stabilize clouds for a longer time",
    ", energy must be supplied , either by internal processes like stellar winds and outflows ( franco & cox 1983 , mckee 1989 ) or externally , e.g. by the shear motions induced through galactic differential rotation ( fleck 1981 ) .",
    "the spread in stellar ages for a given cluster is however similar to the dissipation time scale indicating that clusters form in regions where turbulence could decay leading to gravitational collapse . how turbulence is driven and why at some point in the evolution of the cloud the driving mechanism fails remains an outstanding issue .",
    "previous numerical models of isolated gaseous spheres have shown that stellar clusters could form as a result of gravitational collapse and fragmentation ( see e.g. larson 1978 , keto , lattanzio & monaghan 1991 ) .",
    "these models were however strongly constrained by numerical resolution .",
    "more recently , whitworth et al ( 1995 ) , turner et al . ( 1995 ) and bhattal et al . (",
    "1998 ) investigated in detail the fragmentation of shocked interfaces of colliding molecular clumps into small stellar systems .",
    "the effects of gas accretion on the evolution of a newly formed , young stellar clusters has been investigated by bonnell et al .",
    "they found that gas accretion is highly non - uniform with a few stars accreting significantly more than the rest and concluded that competitive accretion processes play an important role in shaping the initial stellar mass function .",
    "finally , the individual collapse of perturbed protostellar cores and their break - up into binaries and multiple systems has recently been studied with high resolution ( see e.g. burkert & bodenheimer 1993 , 1996 ; burkert , bate & bodenheimer 1997 ; boss 1997 , truelove et al . 1997 , 1998 , bate 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend previous studies of the collapse of isolated gas clumps to the molecular cloud regime and study the formation of stellar clusters localized within globally stable molecular clouds .",
    "our simulations combine self - consistently previous studies of the dynamics of turbulent molecular clouds with studies of their collapse and fragmentation stage till the formation of a stellar cluster including its competitive accretion phase . in a previous short letter ( klessen et al .",
    "1998 ) we discussed a high - resolution simulation which lead to a stellar cluster with a log - normal mass distribution in excellent agreement with observations of multiple stellar systems .",
    "the current paper will explore the formation and early evolution of a star cluster in greater detail , starting from different initial realizations of clumpy molecular clouds with initial power - spectrum @xmath0 .",

    "sph ( _ smoothed particle hydrodynamics _ ) is a particle - based scheme to solve the equations of hydrodynamics . as the fluid",
    "is represented by an ensemble of particles , the technique can be regarded as an extension of the pure gravitational @xmath3-body system . besides being characterized by its mass @xmath5 , velocity @xmath6 and location @xmath7 , each particle @xmath8",
    "is associated with a density @xmath9 , an internal energy @xmath10 ( equivalent to a temperature @xmath11 ) , and a pressure @xmath12 .",
    "the time evolution of the fluid is represented by the dynamical evolution of the sph particles .",
    "their behavior is governed by the equation of motion supplemented by additional equations to modify the hydrodynamic properties .",
    "thermodynamic observables are obtained by averaging over an appropriate subset of the sph particles .",
    "excellent overviews over the method , its numerical implementation , and some of its applications have been written by benz ( 1990 ) and monaghan ( 1992 ) .",
    "we use sph because it is intrinsically lagrangian : as opposed to mesh - based methods , it does not require a fixed grid to represent fluid properties and calculate spatial derivatives ( see e.g.  hockney & eastwood 1988 ) .",
    "the fluid particles are free to move and  in analogy  constitute their own grid .",
    "the method is therefore able to resolve very high density contrasts because the particle concentration increases where needed .",
    "our code is based on a version originally developed by benz ( 1990 ) .",
    "it uses a standard description of a von  neumann - type artificial viscosity ( monaghan & gingold 1983 ) with adopted parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the linear and quadratic terms .",
    "the system is integrated in time using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg scheme , allowing individual time steps for each particle . in any self - gravitating fluid ,",
    "regions with masses exceeding the jeans limit become unstable and collapse . in the current code , once a highly - condensed object forms in the center of a collapsing gas clump and has passed a certain density threshold , the dense core is substituted by a ` sink ' particle ( bate , bonnell & price 1995 ) .",
    "this particle has a fixed accretion radius , which is of order of the jeans length at the density at which the sink particle is created .",
    "it inherits the combined masses , linear and ` spin ' angular momenta of the particles it replaces .",
    "it has the ability to accrete further sph particles from its infalling gaseous surrounding .",
    "again , the mass of the accreted particles , their linear and angular momenta will be added to the sink particle in order to guarantee mass and momentum conservation .",
    "the accreted particles are then removed from the calculation . by adequately replacing high - density cores by sinks and keeping track of their further evolution in a consistent way the code time stepping",
    "is prevented from becoming prohibitively small and we are able to follow the dynamical evolution of the system over many free - fall times .",
    "however , this procedure implies that information about the evolution of gas inside the sink particle is lost . in our case",
    "a sink particle corresponds to a gravitationally collapsing protostellar core . for a detailed description of the physical processes inside a protostellar core",
    ", a new simulation just concentrating on this single object would be required with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions taken from the larger - scale simulation ( burkert , klessen & bodenheimer 1998 ) .",
    "to achieve high computational speed , we use sph in combination with the special - purpose hardware device grape ( sugimoto et al .  1990 , ebisuzaki et al .",
    "this device calculates the forces and the potential in the gravitational @xmath3-body problem by direct summation on a specifically designed chip with very high efficiency .",
    "this allows calculations at supercomputer level on a normal workstation .",
    "additionally , grape returns the list of nearest neighbors for each particle .",
    "this feature makes it attractive for use in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( umemura et al .",
    "1993 , steinmetz 1996 ) .",
    "for particles near the surface of the integration volume , ` ghost ' particles are created to correctly extend the neighbor search beyond the borders of the computational volume ; no forces are computed for these particles .",
    "since we wish to describe the dynamical evolution of a gravitationally unstable region in the interior of a considerably larger globally stable molecular cloud , we adopt periodic boundary conditions to prevent overall collapse . as grape can not treat periodic particle distributions directly due to its restricted force we have to introduce the ewald ( 1921 ) method to prevent global collapse .",
    "the basic idea is to compute a periodic correction force for each particle on the host computer , applying a particle - mesh like scheme : we first compute the forces in the isolated system using direct summation on grape , then we assign the particle distribution to a mesh and compute the periodic correction force for each grid point , by convolution with the adequate green s function in fourier space .",
    "finally , we add this correction to each particle in the simulation .",
    "the corrective green s function can be constructed as the offset between the periodic solution ( calculated via the ewald approximation ) and the isolated solution on the grid .",
    "this method has proven to be numerically stable and inexpensive in terms of the computational effort ( klessen 1997 ) .      to make full use of the lagrangian nature and",
    "resolving power of sph the smoothing volume over which hydrodynamic quantities are averaged in the code is freely adjustable in space and time such that the number of neighbors considered is always kept in the range 30 and 70 , with the optimum value being 50 .",
    "this sets a natural limit to the spatial resolution of the code .",
    "it is furthermore constrained by the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( 1928 ) criterion .",
    "it demands that the minimum time stepping in the sph code is always less than the time required for a sound wave to cross the minimum smoothing volume . in order to prevent the time stepping required to resolve very high density peaks to become prohibitively small",
    ", one has to introduce a minimum smoothing length which defines the smallest resolvable length scale . in our simulations of self - gravitating gas",
    "the spatial resolution is subject to an additional constraint . in order to correctly treat the dynamical evolution of high - density peaks ,",
    "the mass contained within the smoothing volumes of two interacting particles must be less than the local jeans mass .",
    "otherwise , the stability of the clump against gravitational collapse depends on the detailed implementation of the gravitational force law and on the kernel function used for the simulation , rather than on physical processes .",
    "the minimum jeans mass that is reached during the calculation must always be greater than approximately twice the mass of particles in the sph kernels ( bate & burkert 1997 ) .",
    "if one bears this caveat in mind , the sph method calculates the time evolution of gaseous systems very reliably and accurately .",
    "additionally it offers spatial and dynamical flexibility that has yet to be achieved by grid - based methods .",
    "the numerical models discussed in this paper describe self - gravitating , isothermal gas .",
    "this is justified by the typical densities observed in molecular clouds and determines the equation of state as well as the physical processes considered in the model .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the gas is scale - free and depends only on the ratio of the internal to gravitational energy .",
    "we start with an initially clumpy cloud region with density fluctuations following a gaussian random distribution .",
    "the velocities are computed self - consistently from the poisson equation . assuming that stellar clusters form through the gravitational collapse of clumpy cloud regions that have lost their turbulent support , we study the detailed behavior of this process and the properties of the newly formed cluster .      for isothermal gas ,",
    "the energy density is a function of temperature only and the equation of state reduces to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the thermal sound speed .",
    "this approximation is valid for physical regimes where the cooling time scales are much less than the dynamical ones . in molecular clouds ,",
    "this is the case for gas densities @xmath17@xmath18 , where the gas is optically thin for the dominant cooling processes and energy is radiated away very efficiently ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "average densities in star forming regions typical are in the range @xmath19 which is the density range of our models .",
    "even when resolving a density contrast of @xmath20 , the isothermal equation of state is appropriate throughout the entire simulation .",
    "the self - gravitating , isothermal model studies the interplay between gravity and gas pressure , it is thus scale free . besides the dependence on the initial density and velocity distribution , the dynamical evolution of the system depends only on one additional free parameter , the ratio between the internal energy @xmath21 and the potential energy @xmath22 . this ratio can be interpreted as a dimensionless _ temperature _ , @xmath23 line widths in molecular clouds are super - thermal , implying the presence of supersonic turbulent motions ( e.g.  blitz 1993 ) . in case of isotropic turbulence , these non - thermal ( turbulent ) contributions can be accounted for by introducing an _ effective _ energy @xmath24 adding up the thermal and non - thermal contributions to the kinetic energy .",
    "this is equivalent to defining an _ effective _ temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the turbulent velocity dispersion is denoted by @xmath26 and the factor @xmath27 depends on the degree of freedom . in case of anisotropic turbulent motions ,",
    "the system has ( locally ) preferred axes and the concept of one single effective temperature is not valid .      in analogy to the temperature , we adopt dimensionless and normalized units for all physical quantities .",
    "all masses are scaled relative to the total mass of the simulated molecular cloud region , and the length scale is its size @xmath28 .",
    "the numerically simulated area is then a cube @xmath29 ^ 3=[-1,+1]^3 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the density of the homogeneous cube is @xmath30 . in order to trigger gravitational collapse and star formation we consider systems that are highly unstable against gravitational collapse and set @xmath31 .",
    "the volume will then contain @xmath32 jeans masses .",
    "we assume the gravitational constant @xmath33 and the gas constant @xmath34 with @xmath35 for an ideal gas having three degrees of freedom . in these units",
    "the sound speed is @xmath36 and the jeans mass follows as @xmath37    in order to scale to physical units let us consider a dark cloud like taurus with @xmath38 and @xmath39k . assuming a mean molecular weight of @xmath40 , the units of mass and length correspond to @xmath41m@xmath42 and @xmath43pc , respectively .",
    "the time unit is equivalent to @xmath44years and the average jeans mass transforms to @xmath45 .",
    "applied to a dense , massively star - forming cloud with @xmath46 and @xmath39k , similar to the bn region in orion , the simulated cube translates into a mass of @xmath47m@xmath42 and a size scale @xmath48pc .",
    "the time unit now converts to @xmath49years and the mean jeans mass for the homogeneous distribution is @xmath50 .",
    "molecular clouds are stabilized against global collapse by the presence of supersonic turbulence as indicated by the large observed line width ( e.g.  blitz 1993 ) .",
    "however , molecular clouds do form stars .",
    "star formation occurs in their interior in regions which _ locally _ lose turbulent support and which begin to contract to form stars or clusters of stars .",
    "the time scale for freely decaying turbulence is of the order of the free - fall time or shorter ( e.g.  mac low et al .",
    "1998 ) . as the processes that lead to the local loss of turbulent support",
    "are not well understood , we do not attempt to model that stages of the evolution and start our simulations when turbulence has already decayed .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption of instantaneous loss of support .",
    "the sizes of local collapse regions are typically much smaller than the overall extent of the cloud . to a good approximation",
    "we therefore neglect the influence of cloud boundaries and place the considered volume inside an infinite cloud .",
    "hence , to describe a gravitationally unstable volume inside an overall stable cloud of much larger extent we adopt periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a commonly used scheme when describing turbulent cloud dynamics ( e.g. mac low et al .",
    "1998 , stone et al .",
    "1998 , klessen 2000 ) .    with the adopted values of @xmath51 collapse progresses quite rapidly and the influence of the boundary conditions on the overall dynamics is weak .",
    "the situation changes when the scaling parameter @xmath52 is increased .",
    "the total number of jeans masses contained in the computed cube then decreases , which in our isothermal models is equivalent to ` zooming ' in onto smaller spatial volumes .",
    "hence , the adopted boundary conditions become more important and may begin to influence the collapse behavior of individual protostellar cores .",
    "as cores are never isolated , but instead interact with each other or accrete gas from their environment , in the case of @xmath53 boundaries allowing for mass inflow would become more appropriate . indeed , this study may be used for finding the optimum boundary conditions for high - resolution simulations which focus on the evolution of individual protostellar cores .",
    "we defer a detail discussion of this issue to paper ii where we address the influence of different initial and boundary conditions . decreasing @xmath52 on the other hand",
    "means increasing the corresponding physical extend of the computed volume .",
    "the simulation treats a larger fraction of molecular cloud material and results in a larger number of protostellar cores that form during the dynamical evolution and fragmentation of the gas .",
    "this , however , also increases the computational demands ( if a fixed mass and spatial resolution for individual cores is retained ) .",
    "the adopted value @xmath51 in the present paper corresponds to the maximum number of jeans masses which we can handle with sufficient numerical resolution .",
    "the dynamical evolution of gas in a molecular cloud region depends on its initial density and velocity distribution . in a self - consistent model , both",
    "are related via poisson s and the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we adopt random gaussian fluctuations for the density as starting condition for the sph simulations .",
    "we use this approach , because these distributions have well determined statistical properties and can easily be generated by the zeldovich approach ( see appendix [ app : zel ] ) .",
    "furthermore , their properties resemble the end stages of decaying turbulence and are suited to mimic observed features of molecular clouds once advanced into the non - linear regime ( see e.g.  stutzki & gsten 1990 , who deploy a gaussian decomposition technique to describe the clumpy structure of molecular clouds ) .",
    "gaussian random fields @xmath54 are completely characterized by their first two moments , the mean value @xmath55 and the 2-point correlation function @xmath56 , which is equivalent to the power spectrum @xmath57 in fourier space .",
    "all higher moments can be expressed in terms of @xmath58 .",
    "for an isotropic fluctuation spectrum , @xmath59 , the 2-point correlation degrades to a function of the distance between two points , @xmath60 . by defining a normalization @xmath61 and the power spectrum @xmath62 in fourier space , all statistical properties of the field",
    "@xmath54 are determined .",
    "the function @xmath62 identifies the contribution of waves with wave number @xmath63 to the statistical fluctuation spectrum . in gaussian random fields ,",
    "the phases are arbitrarily chosen from a _ uniform _ distribution in the interval @xmath64 , and the amplitudes for each mode @xmath63 are randomly drawn from a _",
    "gaussian _ distribution with width @xmath62 centered on zero .",
    "since waves are generated from random processes , only the properties of an _ ensemble _ of fluctuation fields are determined in a statistical sense .",
    "individual realizations ( from different sets of random numbers ) may deviate considerably from this mean value , especially at small wave numbers @xmath63 , i.e.  at long wave lengths , where only a few modes @xmath65 contribute to the wave number @xmath66 .",
    "this means that different density fields generated from the same power spectrum @xmath62 may _ look _ quite differently , especially on large scales ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nine - models ] ) , despite having identical statistical properties .",
    "this variance effect can be reduced by considering and averaging over a large enough ensemble of realizations .",
    "we generate the initial density fluctuation fields by applying the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approach .",
    "the method and its applicability to gaseous systems is discussed in detail in the appendix [ app : zel ] .    in the current paper , we concentrate our analysis on a simple power - law functional form for the fluctuation spectrum , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 . as @xmath69 is a negative number ,",
    "most power is in large - scale modes .",
    "this choice gives a good representation of the observed patchiness and inhomogeneity of molecular clouds .",
    "the dependence of the dynamical evolution of the model cloud on variations of the initial density distribution with different exponents @xmath69 of the power law will be discussed in paper ii .",
    "we present results from a detailed analysis of nine different initial realizations of @xmath0 and use different particle numbers to address the issue of numerical resolution : six models with @xmath70 sph particles , two with @xmath71 and one with @xmath72 particles , respectively .",
    "all models are generated using the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation ( see appendix [ app : zel ] ) and their properties are summarized in tab .  [",
    "tab : models - n=2 ] . the projection into the @xmath73-plane of the initial particle distribution in each model at the start of the dynamical evolution with sph",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nine - models ] .",
    "all but one model assume a random uniform particle distribution before applying the zeldovich shift .",
    "placing particles randomly into a given volume produces an overall distribution that is homogeneous on large scales , but is subject to statistical fluctuations on small scales which introduce white noise into the correlation function .",
    "the scale at which this effect becomes important is of the order of the mean inter - particle distance .",
    "these undesired small - scale fluctuations may influence the fragmentation behavior of the gas .",
    "however , with the adopted temperature , the mass of small - scale regions of enhanced density is much less than the local jeans mass .",
    "therefore , these fluctuations are quickly damped and dynamically unimportant .",
    "as alternative to the random distribution , in model @xmath74 particles are placed on a regular grid before applying the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this distribution is force - free and has exactly uniform density .",
    "on the other hand , the grid has preferred axes which introduce anisotropies in the neighbor list of each particle .",
    "this fact may again influence the small - scale behavior . on larger scales ,",
    "the system is increasingly isotropic and this effect becomes negligible . in the hydrodynamic evolution phase after the zeldovich shift traces of the grid are quickly erased . comparing the dynamical evolution ,",
    "the model with the particles placed on a grid is statistically indistinguishable from the models generated from a random distribution , which we use as standard .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : zel ] , the zeldovich shift interval @xmath75 determines the density contrast in the particle distribution .",
    "typically , larger @xmath75 leads to higher initial peak densities . on the other hand ,",
    "smaller @xmath75 implies that a larger fraction of the total time evolution of the gas has to be computed with the sph method and pressure forces , which are not included in the zeldovich approximation , have more time to act on the gas . in general ,",
    "@xmath75 should be chosen small enough so that the subsequent evolution is not dependent on the choice of @xmath75 . in our models this is indeed the case for @xmath76 as is shown in appendix [ subsec : validity ] . to address this issue further and to examine how a variation of the zeldovich shift interval influences the properties of the protostellar cluster that forms during the dynamical evolution and collapse of the gas ,",
    "three models are generated with smaller shift intervals @xmath75 : model @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and model @xmath79 together with the high - resolution model @xmath80 having @xmath81 . within the statistical variance between different models",
    "the results are not dependent on the initial shift interval .",
    "due to the small value of @xmath52 the gravitational energy outweighs the internal energy by far and the system is highly unstable to gravitational collapse and fragmentation . as a result ,",
    "typically about sixty collapsed cores form during the dynamical evolution .",
    "a complete time evolution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d - cube - a ] .",
    "representative for all nine models it shows snapshots of the model @xmath82 at twelve different stages of its dynamical evolution . note",
    "that the cube has to be seen periodically replicated in all directions . with the start of the sph simulation ,",
    "pressure forces begin to act on the gas and smear out fluctuations which are below the local jeans limit . on the other hand ,",
    "large modes are unstable against gravitational collapse and start to contract . at @xmath83",
    "the first highly - condensed cores form in the centers of the most massive and densest jeans - unstable gas clumps and are replaced by sink particles ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "soon , clumps of smaller initial mass and density follow . the density threshold for the formation of sink particles",
    "is chosen to be @xmath84 and the diameter of the sink particles is 1/100 of the linear size of the simulated cube .",
    "it is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d - cube - a ] that the system evolves into a network of intersecting sheets and filaments .",
    "the gas density is highest along filaments and at their intersections .",
    "these are the locations where dense cores form predominantly and soon a hierarchically - structured cluster of accreting protostellar cores , represented by sink particles is built up . whereas the overall dynamical evolution of the system is initially dominated by hydrodynamic effects ( all the mass is in the gas phase ) , the later evolution is increasingly determined by the gravitational @xmath3-body interaction between protostellar cores and between cores and their clumpy gaseous environment because more and more gas is accreted onto dense cores .",
    "the final result is a bound dense cluster of protostars .",
    "after a few cluster crossing times , core motions have been randomized by close encounters and the protostars have lost knowledge of their initial conditions .    at this stage",
    "it is necessary to draw attention to one caveat : the gas in the models is treated isothermal .",
    "this implies that there exists no feedback mechanism which may prevent the complete accretion of all the gas into cores and at late phases the global core - formation efficiency , defined by the percentage of gas that is converted into dense cores , approaches unity .",
    "this appears unphysical and is not observed in star - forming regions . at some stage during the protostellar evolution phase , feedback processes from nascending stars inside protostellar cores or from already existing massive stars in their vicinity will become relevant and terminate the accretion and collapse phase .",
    "these effects can not be treated in an isothermal model .",
    "however , the early ( isothermal ) phases of the collapse of molecular cloud regions and the formation of a stellar cluster are well described .",
    "the time at which these assumptions become less appropriate is difficult to estimate .",
    "we are therefore hesitant to interpret the models beyond the phase at which more than @xmath85% of the gas has been accreted onto protostellar cores .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d - cube - i ] , four stages of the evolution of the high - resolution model @xmath80 are presented .",

    "[ fig:3d - cube - i ] plots the distribution of the gas density .",
    "the density field is scaled logarithmically with darker areas denoting higher densities .",
    "hence , dark dots identify the location of dense collapsed cores . when comparing the time scales for core formation and subsequent accretion with the previous model",
    ", the different zeldovich shift intervals have to be taken into account . in the high - resolution calculation",
    "@xmath80 it is chosen to be @xmath87 instead of @xmath88 for model @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the adopted accretion radius of sink particles in the code was reduced by a factor of two , it is now @xmath89 of the linear size of the simulation box .",
    "this delays the formation and accretion onto sink particles by @xmath90 .",
    "altogether , the state of the system where the mass fraction accumulated in collapsed cores exceeds a certain percentage is reached somewhat later by @xmath91 in simulation @xmath80 . besides this delay , the dynamical evolution of both systems is very similar , leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores which grow in mass by accretion from its surrounding gas reservoir . we conclude that our basic results are not resolution dependent .",
    "supplementing the general outline of the dynamical evolution in the last section , we now present a detailed analysis of the large - scale collapse and fragmentation behavior of the system .",
    "first , we discuss the one - point probability density functions of the density and of the distribution of line - of - sight velocity centroids .",
    "then we describe the clumping properties of the gas at various stages of its dynamical evolution , the kinematic and spatial properties of the protostellar cluster that forms as the system advances in time and the mass spectrum of protostellar cores .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the boundedness of the cluster and the rotational properties of protostellar cores . finally , we speculate about the implications of our results for understanding the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) by comparing the numerically calculated core mass spectrum with the imf for multiple stellar systems .      there has been a series of recent attempts to use one - point probability density functions ( pdf ) as statistical descriptors of properties of the interstellar medium , in particular as diagnostic to distinguish between different physical processes influencing its dynamics and time evolution . for a discussion of the one - point probability density function of the density field and its relevance for the star formation process",

    "the cluster re - expands and rapidly develops a core / halo structure which is typical for collision - dominated self - gravitating @xmath3-body systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the overall nature of the star formation process can only be understood in the frame work of a statistical theory , where a sequence of probabilistic events may naturally lead to a log - normal imf ( e.g.  zinnecker 1990 , larson 1992 , 1995 , richtler 1994 , price & podsiadlowski 1995 , murray & lin 1996 , elmegreen 1997 ; also adams & fatuzzo 1996 ) . since the final mass distribution of protostellar cores in our self - gravitating , isothermal models is a consequence of the chaotic dynamical evolution during the accretion phase , our simulations support this hypothesis .",
    "in this paper we numerically investigated the dynamical evolution and fragmentation of molecular clouds and discussed the interplay between gravity and gas pressure .",
    "we identified the processes that dominate the formation and evolution of ( proto)stellar clusters and determine their properties . from the results",
    "we can conclude that even simple , isothermal models of self - gravitating clumpy clouds are able to explain many of the observed features of star - forming regions .",
    "this is rather surprising , given the fact that magnetic fields and energetic heating processes of newly formed stars could in principle be important , both of which have been neglected . at this point",
    "the reader should be cautioned again that our isothermal models do not include any feedback effects from the star formation process itself . at late stages of the evolution energy and momentum input from young stars is likely to modify the dynamical properties of the accreting gas and the simple isothermal approach which we follow here needs to be extended by more elaborate schemes .",
    "our simulations show that , in general , the formation of a cluster of condensed cores and protostars through gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud region is extremely complex .",
    "the dynamical evolution of molecular gas is determined by the interplay between self - gravity and gas pressure .",
    "this creates an intricate network of filaments , sheets and dense clumps .",
    "some clumps will become gravitationally unstable and undergo rapid collapse . while contracting individually to form protostellar cores in their interior , gas clumps stream towards a common center of attraction : the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds involves processes acting simultaneously on different length scales and time scales . while following the large - scale flow pattern , gas clumps can undergo further fragmentation or merge at the intersections of filaments . at that stage ,",
    "the central regions of some clumps will have already collapsed to sufficiently high densities to be identified as protostellar cores .",
    "these cores rapidly grow in mass via accretion from their parental gas envelope .",
    "when clumps merge , the newly formed clump may contain a multiple system of protostellar cores which subsequently compete with each other for accretion from the same limited and rapidly changing reservoir of contracting gas in which they are embedded .",
    "since the cores are dragged along with the global gas flow , a dense cluster of accreting protostellar cores builds up quickly .",
    "analog to dense stellar clusters , its dynamical evolution is subject to the complex gravitational interaction between the cluster members : close encounters occur frequently and will drastically alter the orbital parameters of cores .",
    "this leads to the formation of unstable triple or higher - order systems , and consequently a considerable fraction of protostellar cores becomes expelled from the cloud .",
    "these cores effectively stop accretion and their final mass is determined .",
    "the presence of unpredictable dynamical events in the overall gas flow and the evolution of the nascending protostellar cluster very efficiently erases the memory of the initial configuration .",
    "for this reason , we can not predict the detailed evolution of individual objects just from the initial state of the system . only the properties of an _ ensemble _ of protostellar cores , for example their kinematics and mass distribution , can be determined in a probabilistic sense .",
    "a comprehensive theory of star formation needs to be a _",
    "statistical theory_. some first attempts to formulate a statistical model of the star - formation process appear very promising ( e.g.  zinnecker 1990 , larson 1992 , 1995 , richtler 1994 , price & podsiadlowski 1995 , murray & lin 1996 , adams & fatuzzo 1996 , elmegreen 1997 ; for an overview see scalo 1998b ) and are supported by the results of our numerical study .",
    "taken together , our simulations strongly suggest that _ gravitational _ processes and accretion dominate the early phases of star formation .",
    "we extend the above overview by giving a detailed list of the features and results of our calculations derived from the comparison of our numerical models with specific observational properties of molecular clouds and young stellar clusters :    * * one - point probability distribution function of density and line - of - sight velocity centroids : * during the dynamical evolution of the system gravitational contraction on large scales and the collapse of individual gas clumps result in considerable distortions of the pdf s away from the initial gaussian behavior .",
    "the pdf of the logarithm of the density is best described by a ( multiple ) power - law distribution and the pdf of the line - of - sight velocity centroids develop extended high - velocity wings .",
    "this also holds for the line profiles themselves ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : pdfs ] ) .",
    "* * clump mass spectrum : * during the early phases of star formation our simulations of self - gravitating isothermal gas are able to reproduce the observed power - law clump - mass spectrum of molecular clouds .",
    "this is due to the progression of non - linear gravitational attraction and the disintegration of small clumps by gas pressure .",
    "the observed spectrum is best fit at times between the formation of the first condensed objects up to the time when depletion of the gas reservoir becomes considerable . neither the initial gaussian fluctuation spectrum , nor the final stages of the evolution when most of the gas is condensed into protostellar cores , give a clump - mass distribution which is in agreement with the observations .",
    "this is discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : clump - mass - spectrum ] .",
    "* * the shapes of individual clumps : * dense jeans - unstable gas clumps are the precursors of protostellar cores . as being part of a complex network of filaments ,",
    "individual clumps are typically very elongated objects with ratios between semi - major and semi - minor axis of 2:1 to 4:1",
    ". however , in many cases ( especially at the intersection of two filaments ) they can be quite irregularly shaped .",
    "these features are in agreement with observed dense pre - stellar cores in dark clouds ( sec .",

    "they accrete the bulk of their final mass from their close vicinity .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , matter that forms cores at later times has already undergone considerable dynamical evolution ; these cores form from gas that was initially in widely distributed low - density clumps . along filaments",
    ", they stream towards a common center of gravity and may merge at the intersections . once enough mass is accumulated , these clumps undergo rapid collapse and build up new protostellar cores . the cores which form a late stages tend to have very low final masses . *",
    "* competitive accretion and the importance of dynamical interaction : * once a gas clump becomes jeans unstable it collapses and forms a condensed core .",
    "this core grows in mass via accretion from the infalling envelope .",
    "merging may lead to clumps that contain multiple cores .",
    "these compete with each other for the material of a common gas reservoir .",
    "the succession of clump mergers leads to the formation of an embedded , dense protostellar cluster , whose dynamical behavior is dominated by close encounters between cluster members .",

    "s [ subsubsec : growth - protostellar - cores ] & [ subsubsec : dyn - ww ] ) . *",
    "* rotational properties of protostellar cores : * the rotation of a protostellar core is an important parameter for its collapse .",
    "it determines the properties and stability of accretion disks and their tendency for sub - fragmentation . within the complex network of intersecting filaments ,",
    "gas clumps gain angular momentum from tidal torque and shear . in the accretion process",
    "it is transfered onto the embedded cores .",
    "since the angular momentum is gained from large - scale motion , the orientation of the spin vectors of individual protostellar cores is correlated with their location ( sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : rotational - properties ] ) .",
    "a similar correlation is often found in observed star - forming regions between the orientation of the molecular outflows from young stellar objects and their location .",
    "however , the observational data are not conclusive . * * clustering properties of protostellar cores : * the time evolution of a highly jeans - unstable region within a molecular cloud leads to the formation of a dense cluster of protostellar cores .",
    "the final dynamical state of the system closely resembles the properties of observed stellar clusters : it exhibits the typical core / halo structure of collision - dominated @xmath3-body systems , and when calculating its 2-point correlation function , or equivalently the mean surface density of companions as function of separation , one can clearly distinguish between the binary regime and the large - scale clustering regime ( sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : clustering ] ) . * * boundedness of protostellar clusters : * the clusters of protostellar cores in our simulations form as bound entities : the conversion of gas into condensed cores is such that the decrease of potential energy is always balanced by the increase of kinetic energy ( sec .",

    "whereas the protostellar cluster is bound , this may not be true for the resulting stellar cluster .",
    "its kinematical properties depend strongly on the details of the conversion of individual cores into stars : on the speed and the overall efficiency of the process .",
    "however , this can not be treated in our simulations and needs to be addressed in detailed calculations of individual core collapse .",
    "* * mass spectrum of protostellar cores  the star formation efficiency and implications for the imf : * the distribution of stellar masses is one of the most important properties of the star - formation process",
    ". any comprehensive model of star formation must be able to derive this quantity or at least address this issue . in our isothermal models",
    "the masses of protostellar cores are the result of a sequence of unpredictable stochastic events . in a natural way this leads to a _ log - normal _ mass spectrum which peaks roughly at the _ average jeans mass _ of the system ( sec .",

    "to identify clumps , the resulting 3-dimensional density field is subdivided into ten bins equally spaced in the logarithm of the density . starting with the highest density level ,",
    "the particles are sorted by decreasing density , i.e.  the first particle in the list is the one with the highest density .",

    "all additional particles at that level which are connected to the particles of the new clump by means of overlapping smoothing volumes are identified and assigned to the same clump .",
    "the assigned particles are finally removed from the density list . on the other hand ,",
    "if the neighbor list of the tested particle @xmath8 contains contributions from already identified clumps the particle will be associated to the clump that contributes the largest fraction of particles in the neighbor list , only particle @xmath8 will be removed from the sorted list .",

    "this scheme is free of assumptions about the geometrical shape of the clumps which is of great advantage when dealing with highly irregular and filamentary structure as in our numerical simulations of gravitational fragmentation and collapse .",
    "note that two clumps that may at a high level of density be well separated entities , may at lower levels have common contour lines . in our scheme ,",
    "they are still separated even at these lower levels by introducing an artificial ` interface ' between the two clouds .",
    "individual particles are _ always _ assigned to the clump that contributes most neighbors .",
