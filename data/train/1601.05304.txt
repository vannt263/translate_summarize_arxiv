    "the properties of massive high redshift clusters could place powerful constraints on the cosmological parameters that govern the physics of the early universe @xcite .",
    "several studies have used clusters at high redshift to provide valuable information on galaxy formation and evolution in the richest environments and to probe gaussianity in the density field that seeded structure formation @xcite .",
    "massive clusters , with @xmath6 , are identified by their gravitational lensing of background galaxies @xcite , and by the x - ray emission or sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz ) from their hot intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite .    the x - ray emission from diffuse hot plasma at @xmath7",
    "is primarily bremsstrahlung from the gas within the potential well of the cluster s dark matter halo .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the square of the electron density , hence is sensitive to the denser regions of the cluster . on the other hand , the thermal sz effect ,",
    "the change in the brightness of the cosmic microwave background caused by hot electrons in the icm inverse - compton scattering , depends on the icm pressure ( the integrated product of the electron density and temperature on the line of sight ) .",
    "this parameter dependence makes the sz effect a powerful tool to probe lower - density regions of the hot gas , and thus to provide better insight into gas properties outside the cluster core or in the hottest regions . for reviews of the physics of the sz effect",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . due to the different sensitivity of the sz effect and the x - ray emission to outer and inner regions of the cluster , these two independent probes can be used to provide a more complete picture of the icm . by combining x - ray and sz effect data ,",

    "generally the models used to interpret sz effect have been rather simple .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the gas mass distribution of the high redshift cluster ms 1054 - 0321 , taking advantage of a long _ chandra _ observation of ms 1054 - 0321 and high signal / noise sz effect data from ocra , to develop a three - dimensional gas density profile of the @xmath0-model type .",

    "<S> the low gas mass fraction for the western component is likely to be a consequence of gas stripping during the ongoing merger . </S>",
    "<S> the gas mass fraction of the integrated system is @xmath4 : we suggest that the missing baryons from the western component are present as hot diffuse gas which is poorly represented in existing x - ray images . </S>",
