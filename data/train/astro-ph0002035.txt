    "there is increasingly strong evidence that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with star - forming galaxies [ 1,2,3,4 ] and occur near or in the star - forming regions of these galaxies [ 5,3,4,6,2 ] .",
    "these associations provide indirect evidence that at least the long grbs detected by bepposax are a result of the collapse of massive stars .",
    "the discovery of what appear to be supernova components in the afterglows of grbs 970228 [ 7,8 ] and 980326 [ 9 ] provides direct evidence that at least some grbs are related to the deaths of massive stars , as predicted by the widely - discussed collapsar model of grbs [ 10,11,12,13,14,15 ] .",
    "if grbs are indeed related to the collapse of massive stars , one expects the grb rate to be approximately proportional to the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "observational estimates [ 16,17,18,19 ] indicate that the sfr in the universe was about 15 times larger at a redshift @xmath1 than it is today .",
    "the data at higher redshifts from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) in the north suggests a peak in the sfr at @xmath2 [ 19 ] , but the actual situation is highly uncertain .",
    "however , theoretical calculations show that the birth rate of pop iii stars produces a peak in the sfr in the universe at redshifts @xmath3 , while the birth rate of pop ii stars produces a much larger and broader peak at redshifts @xmath4 [ 20,21,22 ] .",
    "therefore one expects grbs to occur out to at least @xmath5 and possibly @xmath6 , redshifts that are far larger than those expected for the most distant quasars .",
    "consequently grbs may be a powerful probe of the star - formation history of the universe , and particularly of the sfr at vhrs .",
    "+     +    in figure 1 , we have plotted the sfr versus redshift from a phenomenological fit [ 23 ] to the sfr derived from submillimeter , infrared , and uv data at redshifts @xmath7 , and from a numerical simulation by [ 21 ] at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations done by [ 21 ] indicate that the sfr increases with increasing redshift until @xmath9 , at which point it levels off .",
    "the smaller peak in the sfr at @xmath10 corresponds to the formation of population iii stars , brought on by cooling by molecular hydrogen .",
    "since grbs are detectable at these vhrs and their redshifts may be measurable from the absorption - line systems and the ly@xmath11 break in the afterglows [ 24 ] , if the grb rate is proportional to the sfr , then grbs could provide unique information about the star - formation history of the vhr universe .",
    "more easily but less informatively , one can examine the grb peak photon flux distribution @xmath12 . to illustrate this",
    ", we have calculated the expected grb peak flux distribution assuming ( 1 ) that the grb rate is proportional to the sfr , ( 2 ) that the sfr is that given in figure 1 , and ( 3 ) that the peak photon luminosity distribution @xmath13 of the bursts is independent of @xmath14 . there is a mis - match of about a factor of three between the @xmath15 and @xmath8 regimes .",
    "however , estimates of the star formation rate are uncertain by at least this amount in both regimes .",
    "we have therefore chosen to match the two regimes smoothly to one another , in order to avoid creating a discontinuity in the grb peak flux distribution that would be entirely an artifact of this mis - match .",
    "for a peak luminosity function @xmath13 and for @xmath16 , the observed grb peak flux distribution @xmath12 is given by the following convolution integration : @xmath17dl_p \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the length of time of observation , @xmath19 is comoving distance , @xmath20 @xmath21 is the local co - moving sfr at @xmath14 , and @xmath22 is differential comoving volume [ 24 ] .",
    "the left panel of figure 2 shows the number @xmath23 of stars expected as a function of redshift @xmath14 ( i.e. , the sfr , weighted by the co - moving volume , and time - dilated ) for an assumed cosmology @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( other cosmologies give similar results ) .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the star - formation rate in figure 1 .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the star - formation rate derived by [ 19 ] .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath23 peaks sharply at @xmath26 and then drops off fairly rapidly at higher @xmath14 , with a tail that extends out to @xmath27 .",
    "the rapid rise in @xmath23 out to @xmath26 is due to the rapidly increasing volume of space .",
    "the rapid decline beyond @xmath26 is due almost completely to the `` edge '' in the spatial distribution produced by the cosmology .",
    "in essence , the sharp peak in @xmath23 at @xmath26 reflects the fact that the sfr we have taken is fairly broad in @xmath14 , and consequently , the behavior of @xmath23 is dominated by the behavior of the co - moving volume @xmath22 ; i.e. , the shape of @xmath23 is due almost entirely to cosmology .",
    "the right panel in figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution @xmath28 of the number of stars expected as a function of redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves have the same meaning as in the upper panel .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath29 of all stars have redshifts @xmath30 .",
    "+     +    the upper panel of figures 3 shows the predicted peak photon flux distribution @xmath12 .",
    "the solid curve assumes that all bursts have a peak ( isotropic ) photon luminosity @xmath31 ph s@xmath32 .",
    "however , there is now overwhelming evidence that grbs are not `` standard candles . ''",
    "consequently , we also show in figure 3 , as an illustrative example , the convolution of this same sfr and a logarithmically flat photon luminosity function @xmath13 centered on @xmath31 ph s@xmath32 , and having widths @xmath33 , 100 and 1000 .. ] the actual luminosity function of grbs could well be even wider [ 25 ] .",
    "the middle panel of figure 3 shows the predicted cumulative peak photon flux distribution @xmath34 for the same luminosity function . for the sfr that we have assumed ,",
    "we find that , if grbs are assumed to be `` standard candles , '' the predicted peak photon flux distribution falls steeply throughout the batse and hete-2 regime , and therefore fails to match the observed distribution , in agreement with earlier work .",
    "in fact , we find that a photon luminosity function spanning at least a factor of 100 is required in order to obtain semi - quantitative agreement with the principle features of the observed distribution ; i.e. , a roll - over at a peak photon flux of @xmath35 ph @xmath36 s@xmath32 and a slope above this of about -3/2 .",
    "this implies that there are large numbers of grbs with peak photon number fluxes below the detection threshold of batse and hete-2 , and even of _",
    "swift_.    the lower panel of figure 3 shows the predicted fraction of bursts with peak photon number flux @xmath37 that have redshifts of @xmath30 , for the same luminosity functions .",
    "this panel shows that a significant fraction of the bursts near the _ swift _ detection threshold will have redshifts of @xmath30 .",
    "we have shown that , if many grbs are indeed produced by the collapse of massive stars , one expects grbs to occur out to at least @xmath9 and possibly @xmath6 , redshifts that are far larger than those expected for the most distant quasars .",
    "grbs therefore give us information about the star - formation history of the universe , including the earliest generations of stars .",
    "the absorption - line systems and the ly@xmath11 forest visible in the spectra of grb afterglows can be used to trace the evolution of metallicity in the universe , and to probe the large - scale structure of the universe at very high redshifts .",
    "finally , measurement of the ly@xmath11 break in the spectra of grb afterglows can be used to constrain , or possibly measure , the epoch at which re - ionization of the universe occurred , using the gunn - peterson test .",
    "thus grbs and their afterglows may be a powerful probe of the very high redshift ( @xmath0 ) universe .",
