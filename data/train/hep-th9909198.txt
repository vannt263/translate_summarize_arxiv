    "the vacuum expectation value of the gaugino bilinear @xmath6 switches on with a value of the order of @xmath7 , breaking local supersymmetry .",
    "supersymmetry - breaking is mediated by the dilaton and moduli superfields @xmath8 , @xmath9 in the four - dimensional supergravity effective theory : the auxiliary fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 take values of the order of @xmath12 , the flat scalar potential for @xmath8 and @xmath13 is lifted and supersymmetry is broken softly in the visible sector @xcite .",
    "it has has usually been assumed that the condensate is well described by the _ globally _ supersymmetric yang - mills theory , since the confinement scale is well below @xmath14 . in the limit of global supersymmetry @xmath15 ,",
    "the condensate does not break supersymmetry @xcite : its value is determined in the effective superpotential approach @xcite , where the gaugino bilinear is the lowest component of the composite chiral superfield @xmath16 , by setting the auxiliary field @xmath17 to zero , where @xmath18 is the nonperturbative superpotential generated by the gauge dynamics .",
    "the connection with supergravity models is via the value of the gauge coupling at unification , which is determined by the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton and moduli .",
    "the same condensate value follows from minimising the scalar potential in supergravity if higher - order terms in @xmath19 are neglected @xcite : we call this the `` truncated approximation '' .",
    "the resulting condensate value is substituted back into the nonperturbative superpotential , which is then a function of the dilaton and moduli only and serves as an effective source of supersymmetry - breaking @xcite .",
    "if the gravitational corrections to the truncated approximation are significant , there will be effects on supersymmetry - breaking , on the stabilization of the dilaton and moduli , and on cosmological inflation models which use gaugino condensation to provide a positive potential @xcite .",
    "the size of corrections is found by minimising the effective action , including gravitationally - suppressed terms , along the condensate direction .",
    "lalak et al .",
    "@xcite used a similar approach to take into account the `` backreaction '' of other fields on the condensate .",
    "our analysis differs from theirs , since we assume a different mechanism for stabilizing the dilaton , we set all superpotential terms which do not depend on the condensate to zero , and we will be interested mainly in the effects on the compactification moduli of string theory , rather than on the dilaton .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the gaugino bilinear is determined by the scalar component of @xmath19 at the stationary point of the effective action @xmath20 as defined by burgess et al .",

    "the gaugino bilinear @xmath26 is then the lowest component of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 .",
    "the effective action @xmath20 is constructed as a @xmath29 supergravity action , with a superpotential and khler potential which can be found by considering the symmetries of the underlying theory and the corresponding anomalies @xcite . in the case of a single overall modulus , @xmath30 ,",
    "the superpotential is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the gauge kinetic function , equal to @xmath8 at tree level , which depends on the modulus @xmath33 through string loop threshold corrections @xcite , and @xmath34 is a constant which will be discussed shortly .",
    "we can rewrite this as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a function with appropriate transformation properties under the sl(2,*z * ) target - space duality group @xcite .",
    "the condensation scale @xmath38 is defined to be @xmath39 changing the value of @xmath34 is equivalent to changing the unified gauge coupling or the beta - function . in principle",
    "@xmath34 could be determined , if @xmath40 is known , by comparing the resulting condensation scale with the vev of @xmath41 derived from instanton calculations in global susy @xcite(compare @xcite ) .",
    "the khler potential was determined in @xcite as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the perturbative string tree - level khler potential , and @xmath44 is an real constant of order 1 ; we will show that the value of @xmath44 does not affect our results .",
    "this expression for @xmath45 is also valid at one loop if the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation coefficients @xmath46 are neglected : we set @xmath47 for simplicity .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : ktilde0 ] ) can be generalised to include stringy nonperturbative effects @xcite which have been invoked in order to stabilise the dilaton @xcite : we replace ( [ eq : ktilde0 ] ) by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a real function of @xmath50 .",
    "the dilaton dynamics will enter in the effective action only through the auxiliary field @xmath10 , so we do not need to specify the form of @xmath49 ; however , we require @xmath51 for the dilaton kinetic term to have the right sign .",
    "note that @xmath52 becomes ill - defined for @xmath53 .",
    "it is not surprising that the effective action for @xmath19 breaks down in this limit , since it means that the condensate forms at the string scale and the gauge group is strongly - coupled _ at unification_. this limitation has implications for the behaviour of the condensate at large re(@xmath33 ) , which will be discussed later .",
    "the supergravity action is invariant under target - space sl(2,*z * ) transformations @xcite if the superpotential transforms as a modular form of weight @xmath54 .",
    "the modulus @xmath33 transforms as @xmath55 where @xmath56 are integers satisfying @xmath57 .",

    "the @xmath19-dependent part of the khler potential is then modular invariant . in order to avoid singularities inside the fundamental domain of sl(2,*z * ) , @xmath37 must be of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the dedekind eta function and @xmath63 is a constant or a modular invariant function of @xmath33 without singularities @xcite .    the part of @xmath64 relevant to finding the value of the condensate is the scalar potential , which is given as usual by @xmath65 the indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 range over the scalar components of @xmath19 , @xmath8 and @xmath33 ( from now on these symbols will denote the scalar components rather than the superfields ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( where x is any function of the scalars and their complex conjugates ) , and @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 .",
    "we find , as in @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 and we have absorbed a factor of @xmath75 into the constant @xmath34 . the only dependence on @xmath44 of the potential ( [ eq : vstz ] ) is in the overall scale , which has no effect on the existence or stability of minima , so we set @xmath76 from now on .",
    "the potential depends on the phase of @xmath77 only through the first term inside the brackets .",
    "if we hold @xmath78 fixed and vary the phase , a minimum can only occur when the argument of the logarithm @xmath79 is real and positive .",
    "the condensate phase @xmath80 is then aligned with @xmath81 @xcite , for @xmath34 and @xmath82 real .",
    "the dependence of the potential on @xmath78 is then determined by two real parameters , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    the truncated approximation amounts to minimising ( [ eq : vstz ] ) in the rigid supersymmetry limit where @xmath15 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath84 is held constant .",
    "the first term inside the bracket then dominates the dependence on @xmath77 and there is a zero - value minimum with unbroken supersymmetry satisfying @xmath87 at @xmath88 substituting this value back into ( [ eq : wnp_h ] ) leads to the well - known form of nonperturbative superpotential @xcite @xmath89 which has been argued to occur independently of any particular supersymmetry - breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "returning to local supersymmetry , when @xmath90 is non - zero , @xmath91 is not a minimum of the scalar potential and we can not invoke the condition that the hidden sector gauge dynamics preserve supersymmetry . for small @xmath90 , the truncated value is a good approximation ; however , we would like to find the size of corrections , and to investigate the behaviour of the potential when the truncated approximation fails .",
    "figure 1 shows the effect on the potential as a function on @xmath78 of varying @xmath84 while keeping @xmath92 fixed .",
    "for there is an absolute minimum with @xmath78 near the truncated value and negative vacuum energy .",
    "for @xmath84 small and positive there is a local minimum at @xmath78 near @xmath92 and the vacuum energy is positive ; as @xmath84 increases the minimum becomes shallower and moves towards smaller values of @xmath78 ; finally the minimum merges with a point of inflection and the condensate value goes discontinuously to zero , as in a first - order phase transition . ] .     on the potential @xmath93 , setting @xmath94.,width=396,height=321 ]    the stationary point condition for the potential ( [ eq : vstz ] ) is a transcendental equation in @xmath77",
    ", so we use a series expansion for @xmath77 near the truncated value and also search for stationary points numerically .",
    "we rewrite the potential as @xmath95 and expand to third order in @xmath96 , obtaining @xmath97 where @xmath98 since @xmath92 is @xmath99 or smaller in most cases of physical interest , we neglect @xmath100 next to 1 and take @xmath101    the series expansion ( [ eq : vorder3 ] ) has stationary points if @xmath102 , with a stationary point of inflection if the equality is satisfied . in terms of the parameter @xmath103 , the condition for a minimum to exist",
    "is @xmath104 which is solved , for positive @xmath105 , by @xmath106 .    where ( [ eq : mincond ] ) holds , the minimum is at @xmath107 which can be expanded as @xmath108 for small x. the leading order corrections to the potential at its minimum in the @xmath77-direction are @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "we also found the condensate value @xmath111 at the minimum of the full potential ( [ eq : vztrc2 ] ) numerically , as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "for all values of @xmath112 , the phase transition at which @xmath111 goes to zero occurs for @xmath105 between 1.968 and 1.972 . for larger",
    "@xmath92 , the transition occurs at slightly smaller values of @xmath105 , indicating a dependence on higher - order terms in @xmath92 : for example , at @xmath113 the transition occurs for @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig : zmzm3 ] shows the value of @xmath115 at the minimum for the full potential and for the series expansion ( [ eq : vorder3 ] ) , as a function of @xmath105 .     at the minimum as a function of @xmath103 , scaled by @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath116 minimise the full potential ( [ eq : vztrc2 ] ) and the third - order series expansion , respectively.,width=396,height=321 ]    we take @xmath117 ; however , the results are very similar for all values of @xmath92 below about @xmath118 .",
    "both curves differ significantly from 1 , and the series expansion is a good approximation to the true minimum for @xmath119 . while the series expansion gives a qualitative picture of the behaviour of @xmath78 near the phase transition , the value of @xmath105 where the transition occurs is about twice that predicted by ( [ eq : mincond ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected , since @xmath120 is large here and the series expansion is less accurate .",
    "figure [ fig : v_atzm ] shows the value of the potential at its minimum and at the truncated value of @xmath77 , and the minimum value of the series expansion , as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "again , there is a significant deviation from the truncated result for @xmath121 few@xmath122 .",
    "in what physical situations are the corrections to the truncated approximation significant ? in order to generate phenomenologially reasonable supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector , we require the gravitino mass @xmath123 to be of the order of a tev ( see for example @xcite ) ; for a single condensate it is given by @xmath124 , which implies a vev of @xmath125 for the physical values taken by the dilaton and moduli today .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 should be at least @xmath127 for corrections to the truncated approximation to be appreciable , so unless one of the terms in @xmath84 is of order @xmath128 or larger the truncated approximation is not in any danger today .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : c2 ] ) can become large only if the ratio @xmath129 does ( note that @xmath130 is a constant of order 10 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the function @xmath49 , which describes stringy non - perturbative effects on the dilaton , will give rise to singularities or very large numbers ; in addition , since @xmath131 can not change sign , it can not be very small without fine - tuning",
    ". the only limit in which the dilaton - dependence causes the truncated approximation to break down is at strong string coupling ( @xmath132 ) , where the effective action is anyway not valid .",
    "the second term involving @xmath133 , where @xmath37 is given by ( [ eq : hh ] ) , may become large if @xmath134 has zeros or singularities in the fundamental domain ; in addition , the eta function decays exponentially with @xmath33 at re@xmath135 , which leads to a divergence at large re@xmath136 ) at certain values of @xmath33 @xcite . at large re@xmath136",
    "the extra dimensions decompactify and an infinite number of kaluza - klein states become light , producing a linear divergence in the gauge kinetic function . at poles or zeros of @xmath63 a finite number of states become light , leading to a logarithmic divergence in @xmath40 . ] .",
    "nothing can be said within the effective theory about the limit of large re@xmath136 or the singularities of @xmath134 , since the condensation scale @xmath38 diverges at these points .",
    "however , at zeros of @xmath134 , @xmath40 becomes large and positive and the condensation scale goes to zero , so the effective action can be used to describe the condensate at these points .",
    "consider the ansatz for the @xmath33-dependence of the superpotential ( [ eq : wnp_h],[eq : hh ] ) involving the absolute modular invariant @xmath137 @xcite , where @xmath134 takes the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 are positive integers or zero and @xmath141 is a polynomial in @xmath142 .",
    "this form for @xmath63 has no singularity in the fundamental domain , but may have zeros at the `` fixed point '' values @xmath143 and @xmath144 , since @xmath145 near @xmath146 and @xmath147 near @xmath144 .",
    "as @xmath33 approaches a zero of @xmath134 ( we consider @xmath146 for definiteness ) , @xmath92 vanishes with @xmath148 and @xmath84 diverges with @xmath149 .",
    "the potential in the truncated approximation @xmath150 varies smoothly as @xmath151 ; in the case @xmath152 , the potential tends to a non - zero value , even though the condensate vanishes at @xmath146 and supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "this puzzle is resolved by looking at the stabilization of the condensate explicitly : as @xmath153 , the parameter @xmath105 diverges as @xmath154 , so for @xmath155 the truncated approximation breaks down and @xmath111 goes to zero abruptly at some finite , small value of @xmath156 .",
    "the scalar potential as a function of @xmath33 develops a `` hole '' around @xmath146 , inside which the condensate and scalar potential vanish and supersymmetry is restored . if @xmath33 were to fall into such a region , since @xmath157 is always a stationary point of the effective action , a non - zero condensate would not immediately be restored if @xmath33 then rolled out to a value where ( [ eq : mincond ] ) held : the universe would have to `` tunnel '' back to a supersymmetry - breaking vacuum .",
    "we also consider varying @xmath33 away from its present - day value in a perturbative heterotic string vacuum with @xmath158 and @xmath159 , to find the effect of our treatment of the condensate on the ( cosmological ) evolution of the moduli if re@xmath136 becomes large .",
    "as was argued above , the present - day value of the condensate should be @xmath160 in planck units . in the case where @xmath161 , @xmath162 varies as @xmath163 : for re@xmath164 this is well approximated by @xmath165 , while the relevant part of @xmath84 is given by @xmath166 re@xmath136 .",
    "the effective theory breaks down when @xmath92 approaches @xmath167 , which occurs when @xmath168 ; however , a non - zero condensate is only stable for @xmath169 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : mincond ] ) , which implies that @xmath170@xmath171 ( depending on the exact values of @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) . at the phase transition where the condensate collapses , @xmath174 so @xmath175 , which is consistent with using the effective action .",
    "this analysis can also be applied to models of cosmological inflation which use the @xmath33 modulus to provide a positive vacuum energy @xcite . in the region of the complex @xmath33 plane where inflation occurs",
    ", @xmath176 should be of order @xmath177 to produce the correct amplitude of cmb fluctuations at large angular scales @xcite .",
    "typically , this can be achieved for @xmath178 and @xmath179 , implying that @xmath92 is of order @xmath180 and @xmath181 : the condensate scale here is much larger than that required to give realistic susy - breaking . repeating the previous analysis",
    ", we find that the effective theory becomes invalid at re@xmath182 and a non - zero condensate ceases to be stable for re@xmath136 between @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "one might hope to find a form of @xmath33-dependent superpotential ( [ eq : hh ] ) involving @xmath137 ( [ eq : h_j ] ) which allows @xmath33 to take large values while keeping modular invariance of the effective action , since it has been suggested that a realistic vacuum of the strongly - coupled heterotic string @xcite may have re@xmath136 of order @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the first term in the large @xmath33 expansion of @xmath137 increases as @xmath186 , so the exponential growth of @xmath187 at large re@xmath136 is likely to be faster than for constant @xmath63 , and there is little prospect of stabilizing either the condensate or @xmath33 with this ansatz .",
    "we have studied the stability of a non - zero gaugino condensate in an effective supergravity model motivated from compactifications of heterotic string theory with duality group sl(2,*z * ) .",
    "we defined a parameter @xmath105 which determines the deviation of the value of the condensate from its value in global supersymmetry . using a series expansion for the effective potential ,",
    "the corrections to the truncated approximation at small @xmath105 were obtained to second order in @xmath188 for the value of the condensate , and to first order in @xmath188 for the vacuum energy as a function of the dilaton and @xmath33 modulus .",
    "numerical minimisation of the effective potential confirms the series expansion results at small @xmath105 , and reveals a phase transition at large @xmath105 where the condensate vanishes discontinuously .",
    "this appears to be caused by the backreaction of the dilaton and @xmath33 modulus on the hidden sector gauge dynamics .",
    "there are implications for the @xmath33-dependence of hidden sector supersymmetry - breaking : the auxiliary field @xmath189 and the scalar potential receive large corrections or go to zero abruptly near special points in moduli space and at large re@xmath136 .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 is not stabilized against arbitrarily large fluctuations .",
    "it would be interesting to find the effect of non - zero green - schwarz anomaly cancellation coefficients on the @xmath8- and @xmath33- dependence of the scalar potential , and also to analyse the stability of the condensate in the linear supermultiplet formalism @xcite .",
    "if the potential for @xmath33 is very flat near the minimum , it may be worth investigating the effect of including planck - suppressed corrections on the @xmath33-dependent yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry - breaking terms , particularly if cp - violating phases depend strongly on the vev of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thanks are due to david bailin for suggesting the problem , to jackie grant for help with the figures and to malcolm fairbairn for a critical reading of the paper in its early stages .",
