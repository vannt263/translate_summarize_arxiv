    "search for a deconfined state of quarks and gluons is a major goal of ongoing experiments based on relativistic heavy - ion collisions at high energies , like relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory , usa and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , switzerland .",
    "these experiments are designed to create a plasma of quarks and gluons , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ; which might have been formed after few micro - seconds of the big bang .",
    "the created matter is described by partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the complete understanding of the properties of this newly created matter has been very challenging . due to the parton ( quarks and gluons ) energy loss in the medium , suppression in particle yields",
    "is observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions relative to @xmath2 collisions , where the formation of a medium is usually not expected .",
    "hence , the measurement of the suppression in particle yield is an ideal diagnostic means to probe the medium .",
    "the amount of suppression is generally measured with the help of nuclear modification factor , @xmath1 , which is defined as @xcite : [ eq1 ] r_aa(p_t)= , where @xmath8 is the yield and @xmath9 is the number of events in nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions averaged over the impact parameter range of the corresponding centrality bin calculated by glauber monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is the inelastic cross section and @xmath12 is the differential cross section for inelastic @xmath2 collisions .",
    "if a+a collisions are considered as mere superposition of scaled @xmath2 collisions , then @xmath1 should always be unity .",
    "deviation of @xmath1 from unity indicates a medium modification .",
    "the observation of suppression in high-@xmath0 particle yields in au+au and pb+pb collisions at rhic and lhc as compared to @xmath2 collisions @xcite , suggests the formation of a dense medium .",
    "also , @xmath1 can be represented as the ratio between final distribution of particles ( @xmath13 ) and the initial particle distribution ( @xmath14 ) .    in this work ,",
    "the initial distribution of the energetic particles is represented by the tsallis power law distribution characterized by the tsallis @xmath6 parameter and the tsallis temperature @xmath15 , remembering the fact that their genesis is due to very hard scatterings . here",
    "the parameter @xmath6 , represents the degree of non - extensivity or in other words the degree of deviation of the system from a thermalized or equilibrated system , which is usually described by the well - known boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics .",
    "we plug in the initial distribution ( @xmath14 ) in boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) and solve it with the help of relaxation time approximation ( rta ) of the collision term to find out the final distribution ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the final distribution includes both equilibrium and tsallis distribution . in our earlier work @xcite ,",
    "we have used the boltzmann - gibbs distribution as an equilibrium distribution function to study the @xmath1 using the secondaries produced in a+a collisions .",
    "as bg distribution only describes the @xmath0-spectra in a+a collisions upto moderate @xmath0 and bgbw has been quite helpful in describing the @xmath0-spectra upto higher @xmath0 , we use the latter distribution as the equilibrium distribution in the present formalism .",
    "boltzmann - gibbs blast wave function has the radial collective flow in built .",
    "now , the @xmath1 is expressible in terms of @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and relaxation time @xmath17 , which can be computed and compared with the experimental observations .",
