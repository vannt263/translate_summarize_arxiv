    "<S> it is practically shown that a pair of neutrinos from tau decay can form a flavor entangled state . with this kind of state </S>",
    "<S> we show that the locality constrains imposed by bell inequality are violated by the quantum mechanics , and an experimental test of this effect is feasible within the earth s length scale . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the quantum entanglement of neutrino pairs can be employed to the use of long distance cryptography distribution in a protocol similar to the bb84 .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement represents the essence of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and is the source of a number of paradoxial and counterintuitive phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel of entanglement is the non - local correlation exhibit by qm . in 1964 , bell derived out a group of inequalities @xcite , that is a set of constraints that local hidden variable theory ( lhvt ) must satisfy whereas qm violates . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments in regard of the bell inequalities have been carried out by using entangled photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> great progress was made in this direction by using pdc technique in generating the entangled photon pairs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly quantum information theory has been developed along with the research of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the same effort has also been made in high energy physics @xcite , where the mixing properties of neutral mesons can play a practical role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> people also attempted to use the entangled state in high energy physics to implement quantum information tasks @xcite , i.e. quantum teleportation .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos are one class of elementary particles known as having only weak interaction with matter . </S>",
    "<S> this nature enables them to transmit over a large scale of distance without significant attenuation . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> thirty years ago it was proposed to be as an ideal means to transmit signals @xcite . in the well - established elementary particle theory , the standard model , </S>",
    "<S> there are three kinds(flavors ) of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrinos with different flavors can oscillate from one to another during the period of transmission . </S>",
    "<S> a nature question then is : can neutrinos form an entanglement state and exhibit the nonlocal correlations ? </S>",
    "<S> we notice that in literatures there are some discussions on the possible epr effects in neutrino sector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the momentum variable , but not the flavors , were concerned . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this work that two flavors of neutrinos from the tau decay can form an entangled state , which can be used as a test of lhvts . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we argue that this entangled state can also be employed in quantum key distributions and a simple quantum key distribution protocol is proposed for it .    , at leading order . </S>",
    "<S> , width=264,height=158 ]    we can consider the tau lepton decay process @xmath0 for our aim . the dominant contribution to this process comes from the tree level diagram , as shown in figure [ ent_feyn ] . in case the two final anti - neutrinos , @xmath1 , @xmath2 symbolizing their momenta in the figure , emitted in ( nearly ) parallel , they will have the same helicity(here their masses are neglected ) , which make their total spin wave function symmetric . to keep antisymmetric nature of fermions , their flavor wave function must by antisymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the wave function of this quasi - paralleled neutrino pair can be formulated as @xmath3 the corresponding differential decay width can be calculated straightforwardly . </S>",
    "<S> it reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean energy of these two entangled antineutrinos and @xmath6 is half of the energy difference of them .    the current global analysis of the neutrino data exhibit that there are only three mixed active neutrinos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to the tri - bimaximal mixing scheme we have the following mixing matrix @xcite : @xmath7 the initial entanglement state ( [ neu_ent ] ) can therefore be expressed in the mass eigenstate , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 with the time evolution , the initial state evolves to @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the evolving time on left and right sides(one can anyway name two neutrinos to be left and right ) . in quantum mechanics , the coincident - count probability of @xmath12 being detected at @xmath10 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 being detected at @xmath11 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 represent @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> following we show that this qm result can not be reproduced by a lhvt , i.e. , the bell inequality will be violated .    </S>",
    "<S> the clauser and horne @xcite ( ch inequality ) type bell inequality for neutrinos takes the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 means that all three - flavor triggers on the right side are countered . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino flavors play the role of polarizations , and the time variation play the role of angles between them in photon experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inequality ( [ ch_inequ ] ) is in agreement with a recent work of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the hardy state is generalized to three or more dimensions in the hilbert space . from </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we can get the following inequality for the entangled neutrino state , i.e. @xmath19    to evaluate the quantum prediction for the inequality ( [ inequ_neu ] ) , we need the neutrino mixing parameters . in the calculation of eq.([coin_p ] ) , the approximation @xmath20 can be taken , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 to be the distance in unit of kilometer . </S>",
    "<S> since we have three neutrino mass eigenstates , there are two independent mass difference squares , i.e. @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the recent values given by the particle data group(pdg ) for further numerical calculation @xcite : @xmath25 in nature unit , the relation between neutrino travelling distance l and it energy reads @xcite @xmath26 here , @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 , e is the energy of the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the numerical result @xmath27 play the role of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we may take @xmath30 mev and @xmath31 in the evaluation in order to make the experiment viable at @xmath32 km scale .    </S>",
    "<S> when taking @xmath33 we get the maximal value of @xmath34 in ( [ inequ_neu ] ) to be @xmath35 , which apparently violates the inequality . with @xmath29 in ( [ time ] ) , we can get the corresponding detection distances @xmath36 figure ( [ g_view ] ) exhibits a global view of the violations , where two parameter contours are obtained when the other two parameters are fixed at their maximum values .        in practical experiment we need to choose four spacial detection points , or in other words the detection time @xmath37 with two on each side ( see ( a ) in figure [ ent_detect ] ) , and measure the probability of coincident counts @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that detectors have the same detect efficiency @xmath39 , and notice that the @xmath39 is a small number for neutrinos . in this condition , the detect efficiency and </S>",
    "<S> the total counting number @xmath40 can be factorized out of the inequality ( [ inequ_neu ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> from ( [ distance ] ) we can get the energy spectral @xmath41 to be @xmath42 and , from this we may estimate to what extent the energy spectral affects the inequality violation . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([distance ] ) indicates that the low energy corresponds to the short distance of flavor oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the tau decay experiment one may choose @xmath43 for detection , which is just above the muon production threshold .     in different distance from the source . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) represents the near - site detectors @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) represents the far - site detectors @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the red region indicates a violation of qm predictions , where @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=306,height=264 ] in different distance from the source . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) represents the near - site detectors @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) represents the far - site detectors @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the red region indicates a violation of qm predictions , where @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=306,height=264 ]    notice that in the detection of inequality ( [ inequ_neu ] ) in experiment , one needs to measure the quantity @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvioius that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent of the time on the @xmath51 side . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can choose to measure the quantity @xmath52 and @xmath53 at some special points , where give the probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we find that at @xmath56 , @xmath55 is of order @xmath57 ; at @xmath58 , @xmath59 is of order @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> they are both negligible in comparison with the other numbers in the inequality , i.e. , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that one needs only to detect two flavors of neutrinos , the @xmath62 and @xmath63 , by virtue of choosing specially points to place the detectors .    finally , </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exits a natural quantum key distribution protocol for the entangled neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> in the situation of entangled neutrino pairs from the tau lepton decays , the four detectors can be placed as follows : @xmath64 to @xmath65 and @xmath66 to @xmath67 have the same distances from the source of neutrino production , as shown in ( b ) of figure [ ent_detect ] , where a for alice and b for bob . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement state makes the coincident counting in a and b to be either @xmath68 , or @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the @xmath70 will not be counted since the neutrinos are originated from the @xmath71 decays . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the same flavor counts must be precisely zero . </S>",
    "<S> suppose eve(e ) make a measurement on the entanglement state before @xmath72 and @xmath73 and resend it . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum state now becomes a product state of @xmath74 or @xmath75 . in order not to be found by alice and bob </S>",
    "<S> , e must select certain detection point , where the same flavor counting of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are both zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , by using of the previous neutrino mixing parameters we find that the zero counting of the same flavors for the product state is a periodical function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as the distance between @xmath64 and @xmath66 ( so as to @xmath65 and @xmath67 ) is less than that period , eve can not obtain any information without being found . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is very similar to that of bb84 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown through a practical experimental design , the tau lepton decay , that the entangled ( anti)neutrino state can be constructed . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that there exists large bell inequality violation possibility in the detection of the entangled neutrino states , which may be treat as a crucial test of lhvts in high energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that there at least exists a protocol , similar to bb84 scheme , for the quantum cryptography distribution . more importantly , the special nature of neutrino makes long - distance quantum communication possible in addition to the effort in electromagnetic approaches . </S>",
    "<S> likely , we will come to the era of neutrino quantum communication in near future . </S>"
