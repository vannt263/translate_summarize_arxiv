    "the recent bicep2 announcement on the tensor - to - scalar ratio at @xmath9 ( @xmath10 after the elimination of the dust background @xcite ) has openned up a new era in the inflationary cosmology .",
    "although there still exists a possibility that most of it is due to the dust background if one extrapolates the planck dust analysis @xcite , it is so an important discovery even with its confirmation at the level of a tenth of the announcement that a particular attention must paid to this announcement . since the temperature perturbation @xmath11 obtained from the scalar perturbation is at the level of @xmath12 , the tensor perturbation of order is just a proportional factor for an order of an estimate to give the bicep2 value @xmath13 for @xmath14 . ]",
    "@xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) will lead to @xmath17 .",
    "namely , even the confirmation of @xmath18 at the level @xmath12 implies that there was the inflationary potential energy density of order @xmath19 .",
    "it is a grand unification ( gut ) scale , and hence the gut scale inflation needs to be scrutinized .",
    "inflationary models need some fine - tuning to fit to the observed valuess of @xmath11 , non - gaussianity , @xmath20 , etc .",
    "for example , the @xmath21 single field chaotic inflation @xcite needs the mass parameter at the level of @xmath22 in units of the reduced planck mass @xmath23 and the inflaton field excursion @xmath24 needs to be trans - planckian , _",
    "why we keep only the @xmath21 term is a kind of an extreme fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 term is not the only term , but also a host of terms is allowed with the discrete symmetry allowed in string compactification @xcite .",
    "this will in general leads to a hilltop potential .    for theories toward inflation , however , physics beyond the standard model is not firmly established yet .",
    "so , it is a simple way to work with theoretically attractive ideas among which the leading ones are guts and supersymmetry ( susy ) . after the discovery of higgs boson ,",
    "the higgs portal to high ( gut and/or intermediate ) energy scale is another widely used method .",
    "so , we consider a simple scenario of three scales , the planck scale @xmath26 , the gut scale @xmath27 , and the electroweak scale @xmath28 .",
    "the intermediate axion scale and the susy breaking scale can be considered as derived ones from these . in this way",
    ", we can introduce the axion window scale @xcite by assuming a peccei - quinn symmetry at a gut scale @xcite which is broken at the intermediate scale . on the other hand",
    ", it was noted that gravitational interactions invalidate the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite broken at the intermediate scale , which seemed to have excluded the invisible axion idea @xcite .",
    "but , the global symmetry breaking terms including the baryon number violating operators can be sufficiently suppressed in some string compactification models @xcite . when this sufficient suppression of the global symmetry breaking terms is realized in string theory , we are free from the gravity spoil of global symmetries because string theory already contains a consistent gravity theory with certain exact discrete symmetries @xcite",
    ". if the global symmetry breaking terms appears at a sufficiently high order , then even the dark energy scale of o(@xmath29 ) can be interpreted in some string compactifications with a high order of discreteness @xcite .",
    "also , the inflaton field is not free from the gravity spoil of global symmetries . for the case of inflaton potentials",
    ", therefore , one only considers the terms implied by string theory , with two leading scales of @xmath30   and @xmath31 .",
    "since a large trans - planckian excursion is needed for the case of single inflaton @xmath32 , one worries about the huge energy density @xmath33 at the trans - planckian field value .",
    "this has led to the natural inflation idea @xcite such that higher order terms are arranged to cut off huge energy down to @xmath34 by nonperturbative effects of a confining gauge group .",
    "it is a gut - scale axion inflation .",
    "however , the axion decay constant is of order @xmath31 .",
    "a large axion decay constant may be introduced by a small quartic coupling constant @xmath35 , @xmath36 the mass parameter in this theory is @xmath37 which is interpreted as a gut scale .",
    "then , @xmath38 can be trans - planckian of order @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "however with this small @xmath41 , ` inflation ' is already in the radial direction , and the angle direction of the natural inflation is not needed . to realize the trans - planckian axion decay constant in the natural inflation , therefore",
    ", we require ( i ) the radial field decays rapidly with @xmath42 , and ( ii ) more confining forces at the gut scale are introduced as done by kim , nilles and pelsoso ( knp ) @xcite .",
    "this knp model already introduces two axions and therefore the hilltop inflation with two inflatons is not much worse than the knp model .",
    "in fact , the hilltop inflation with two inflatons was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and this paper is a numerical study on the feature envisioned there . here",
    ", we extend the single scalar field hilltop inflation to two scalar fields inflation and perform a numerical study of inflation starting from an initial inflation point near the hilltop .",
    "the purpose of introducing the second inflaton is to have a significant second derivative of the inflaton potential so that a large @xmath18 can result to fit to a value of o(0.1 ) by a positive @xmath43 , since the @xmath44 and @xmath18 relation to the slow - roll parameter @xmath45 is @xmath46 . to fit to @xmath47 with a large @xmath18",
    ", one needs a large positive second derivative of @xmath48 .    in sec . [",
    "sec : model ] , we present a two inflatons model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numstudy ] , we numerically solve the evolution equations of these two inflatons and present a scatter plot of the parameters within the required interval of the e - fold number and compared them to the planck and bicep2 data .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion .",
    "the one inflaton hilltop potential with the symmetry @xmath49 , satisfying three conditions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , can be parametrized as @xmath53 the dimensionful variables will be expressed in units of @xmath30  in the following discussion , and we will set @xmath54 if not stated explicitly .",
    "the first and second derivative are @xmath55    then , @xmath18 is given by @xmath56 since the reported central value of bicep2 is @xmath57 without the background dust elimination , the vev of @xmath0 at the bicep2 observation point is determined as @xmath58 . and , @xmath59 is estimated as @xmath60 substituting @xmath61 , @xmath62 the inflaton @xmath0 eventually converges to the ground value @xmath63 .",
    "since the @xmath0 value in the expression of @xmath59 is taken at the bicep2 observation point , @xmath0 tends to be much smaller than @xmath63 to give the @xmath3-fold number 55 . in this case",
    ", @xmath59 is negative and @xmath64 can not be obtained .",
    "even if @xmath61 is comparable to @xmath63 to allow a positive @xmath59 , then @xmath63 must be at least around 40 . since a rough estimation of @xmath59 is o(@xmath65 ) , @xmath59 is o(0.001 ) for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , to raise @xmath44 from @xmath67 to @xmath64 , we need @xmath68 because @xmath69 .",
    "thus , to fit to the large value of bicep2 , @xmath70 , there is a need to introduce another inflaton .",
    "therefore , let us extend the single field hilltop inflation case to the one with two inflatons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the following potential , @xmath71 \\right)^2 , \\label{eq : hilltoptwo } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are taken to be positive .",
    "since the inflation path chooses @xmath74 at @xmath75 up to @xmath76 , @xmath1 is mimicking the waterfall field in the hybrid inflation with the superpotential given in @xcite .",
    "the second derivative with respect to @xmath1 is designed to give a positive @xmath59 , which is the reason that it is called ` chaoton ' .",
    "since the large field value @xmath4 (= inflation path field ) experiences the large hubble friction , it prevents an effective ending of inflation .",
    "here , we point out what usually happens in the large field inflation scenario .",
    "the equation of motion for the inflaton is given by @xmath77 where the hubble parameter @xmath78 is @xmath79 the hubble friction term is large if the field value is large . in this case",
    ", the field velocity reaches its terminal velocity , @xmath80 . for the chaotic inflation with @xmath81 , @xmath82 . equating kinetic energy of terminal field velocity to the potential energy , @xmath83",
    ", we obtain @xmath84 .",
    "we can conclude that if the inflation starts from sufficiently large initial field value , the end point for the inflation is fixed .",
    "this behavior is quite common in any large field inflationary scenario .",
    "thus , another mechanism is needed to end the inflationary period .",
    "so , to end the inflation effectively when @xmath4 passes @xmath85 , we introduce the following interaction with a new field @xmath86 , @xmath87 @xmath86 decays to sm particles and reheats the universe by @xmath88 these terms are helpful to have appropriate @xmath3-fold numbes .",
    "this feature on the inflation will be implemented in a way that the inflation just ends at some point without meeting the inflation ending condition of the kinetic energy of inflaton becoming comparable to the potential energy .",
    "so to fit to the bicep2 vacuum energy , there are four free parameters we can dial along the inflation path : ( 1 ) the initial point @xmath89 to start the inflation where @xmath89 is a bit away from the true hilltop , ( 2 ) the initial velocity @xmath90 , to make the inflaton roll down to the @xmath1 direction when @xmath0 reaches the point @xmath91 , ( 3 ) the bicep2 point @xmath5 where bicep2 collaboration claims that they have found the large b - mode polarization on cmb , and ( 4 ) the end point of inflation @xmath92 .",

    "<S> we consider a cosmological inflation with two inflatons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the inflation potential is a hilltop form in the @xmath0 space and @xmath1 </S>",

    "<S> , we calculate the @xmath3-fold number numerically starting from the intitial point which is in the vicinity of the hilltop point . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , by varying parameters and initial conditions the inflaton path field @xmath4 for the bicep2 point , @xmath5 , is found to give @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> next , from the point @xmath5 to the end of inflation the @xmath3-fold number is obtained . we find a reasonable set of parameters allowing the @xmath3-fold number in the range @xmath8 . </S>"
