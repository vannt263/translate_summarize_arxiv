    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnets have been intensively investigated due to different reasons : there are several classes of quasi-2d materials for which the magnetic interactions within planes of magnetic ions are typically three to six orders of magnitude larger than the interactions between the planes .",
    "these classes include layered magnets ( e.g. rb@xmath4crcl@xmath5 ) , graphite intercalated compounds ( e.g.  cocl@xmath4 ) , magnetic lipid layers ( e.g.  manganese stearate ) , and high-@xmath6 superconductors . for theoreticians 2d magnets with @xmath7- or easy - plane symmetry",
    "are particularly interesting due to the existence of vortices , which have nontrivial properties from the viewpoint of certain homotopical groups , see reviews .",
    "there are two types of vortices : in - plane ( ip ) ones with all spins lying in the easy plane , and out - of - plane ( op ) ones having non - zero spin components orthogonal to the easy plane .",
    "both types have a @xmath8-topological charge or vorticity @xmath9 , which determines the directions of the spins in the easy plane far away from the vortex center .",
    "the op - vortices have an additional @xmath10-topological charge ( pontryagin invariant , see ref .  ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is integer .",
    "@xmath12 is denoted polarization because its sign determines to which side of the easy plane the spins point in the vortex center .",
    "therefore the ip - vortices can be considered as having @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14 there is a gyrocoupling force , or gyroforce , which is formally equivalent to the lorentz force .",
    "@xcite    besides the vortices , which are strongly nonlinear excitations , there are also magnons . the dynamic properties of 2d easy - plane magnets can be described by a phenomenological theory which assumes two ideal gases for the vortices and magnons .",
    "@xcite the vortex - magnon interaction naturally is the next question which arises . in particular , one would like to know how the dynamics of the vortices is affected by this interaction .    for 1d magnets",
    "the soliton - magnon interaction is nearly reflectionless . in this case",
    "the main effect of the soliton - magnon interaction is the change of the magnon density of states , which affects strongly the soliton density in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite for 2d magnets the vortex density can be obtained from the correlation length by a renormalization group approach , @xcite therefore the vortex - magnon interaction is not so important for the density . in principle , it can be important for the damping force which acts on a vortex ( or soliton ) in a near - equilibrium magnon gas .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the damping force for the 2d case can be obtained by general hydrodynamic theories for the relaxation processes in magnets .",
    "@xcite    the most important effect of the vortex - magnon interaction seems to be that for a finite system certain magnon modes are excited due to the vortex motion , and vice versa .",
    "such modes were obtained in recent papers @xcite by a numerical diagonalization for relatively small , circular , discrete systems . a calculation in the continuum limit",
    "was presented for the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "@xcite analytical investigations were done for planar vortices in antiferromagnets @xcite and ferromagnets . @xcite",
    "these articles demonstrate nontrivial properties of the eigenmodes , e.g. , the presence of quasi - local @xcite or truly local @xcite modes .",
    "moreover , the relevance of these modes for the vortex dynamics was shown , in particular an ip - op transition was predicted @xcite and an effective vortex mass was defined and calculated using the above modes .",
    "@xcite however , for op - vortices all this was based on the numerical diagonalization of small systems with fixed ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions ( b.c . ) .",
    "this article deals with a more general theory of vortex - magnon coupling for arbitrarily large systems with circular symmetry and general boundary conditions .",
    "the method consists of a natural combination of analytical calculations in the continuum limit with numerical diagonalization of discrete systems .",
    "the main issue is the calculation of the scattering matrix for vortex - magnon collisions .",
    "@xcite using these data general formulas for the eigenfrequencies are obtained , as a function of the parameters and size of the system , and for different boundary conditions .",
    "an important point is a link with a recent collective variable theory @xcite in which an equation of motion was derived which describes very well the vortex trajectories observed in computer simulations .",
    "this equation is @xmath2 order in time , and is a generalization of the thiele eq .",
    "@xcite which is first order in time . using",
    "the scattering data the parameters of the @xmath2-order equation of motion can be calculated , and agree very well with those obtained from simulations .",

    "the spins @xmath18 are classical vectors on a square lattice with the lattice constant @xmath19 . @xmath20 denote nearest - neighbor lattice sites .",
    "our main interest lies in the small anisotropy case which corresponds to @xmath21 .    a continuum model for fms",
    "can be derived from ( [ model ] ) in the usual way defining the unit vector of magnetization as a function of continuous variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e.  @xmath24 .",

    "merely the expressions for @xmath29 and @xmath28 change .    for the homogeneous ground state ( all spins are parallel and confined to the easy plane ) the 2d model has well - known magnon excitations with the gapless dispersion law @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the magnon wavevector .",

    "we conclude that the vortex motion is accompanied by , or generates , the two quasi - local magnon modes with @xmath81 .",

    "we note that the vortex mass ( [ m / fracpi ] ) is in the same order of magnitude as the two - dimensional soliton mass @xmath307 in ref . , where @xmath308 ( in units @xmath309 ) is the belavin - polyakov energy .",
    "for fixed b.c .",
    "@xmath310 yields @xmath311 , which is about one half of the above value for free boundary condition .",
    "thus in the equation of motion ( [ g_3times ] ) only the gyrovector @xmath312 is an intrinsic property of the vortex .",
    "the quantities @xmath279 and @xmath288 , which are connected to the quasi - local modes with frequencies @xmath313 , are determined by the whole system `` vortex plus magnons '' which includes the geometry of the system and the boundary conditions . for @xmath288",
    "this is obvious because it strongly depends on @xmath95 ; but @xmath279 does not depend on @xmath95 ( in the lowest order ) , however , it depends on the boundary conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the s - matrix naturally is determined only by the region of the vortex core and can thus be used for the calculation of the parameters @xmath279 and @xmath288 for arbitrary geometry and boundary conditions .",
    "finally we point out that eq .",
    "( [ g_3times ] ) belongs to a whole hierarchy of equations of motion which can be derived @xcite by taking into account higher and higher time derivatives of @xmath1 in the generalized traveling wave ansatz ( [ vec_sr ] ) .",
    "moreover , only the odd - order equations of this hierarchy represent valid approximations , because the even - order equations have a very weak leading term , e.g. @xmath278 in the @xmath277-order equation .",
    "therefore the solutions of the latter equations are qualitatively different from the solutions of the odd - order equation and are in fact not confirmed by the simulations ( cf . the above discussion of the single frequency @xmath284 and the doublet @xmath256 , which exhibit quite different dependencies on the system size ) .",
    "the @xmath314-order equation of the hierarchy predicts a second doublet @xmath315 which was in fact observed in the simulations , but only for specially designed initial and boundary conditions because the amplitudes of this doublet are very small .",
    "@xcite thus the @xmath2-order equation represents already a very good approximation .",
    "the observed additional doublet naturally also appears in the results of our numerical diagonalization in section [ sec : results ] and its frequencies can be calculated by @xmath316 and @xmath317 , see eq .",
    "( [ overl ] ) and below .",
    "we have developed a general theory which allows calculation of the magnon modes of a circular easy - plane ferromagnet in the presence of an out - of - plane vortex .",
    "the method consists of a combination of numerical diagonalization of the discrete system with analytical calculations in the continuum limit .",
    "the frequencies of the magnon modes can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath318 , which are independent of the magnetic coupling constants , the system size and the boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath319 describe the intensity of the magnon scattering due to the presence of the vortex .",
    "the translational modes with @xmath81 are particularly interesting for two reasons : ( i ) their frequencies are identified in the vortex motion which was observed in simulations where the landau - lifshitz equation was integrated for the circular discrete spin system .",
    "( ii ) using these frequencies , one can calculate the two parameters of a @xmath2-order equation for the vortex motion ( a generalization of the thiele eq . ) , which was derived by a collective variable theory starting from a generalized traveling wave ansatz .",
    "our calculated parameters agree very well with those obtained by describing the simulations using the @xmath2-order equation of motion .",
    "both parameters , the vortex mass @xmath279 and the @xmath2-order gyrocoupling constant @xmath288 , depend strongly on the boundary conditions .",
    "this is due to the fact that both the in - plane and the out - of - plane structure of the moving vortex are not localized .",
    "in fact , the dynamic parts of the vortex structure oscillate with the frequencies of the translational modes with @xmath81 .",

    "if a classical hamiltonian system is been linearized around a static solution , an eigenvalue problem @xmath320 results with a coefficient matrix @xmath321 fulfilling the generalized symmetry relation @xmath322 @xmath323 is the `` symplectic unit matrix '' , i.e. @xmath324 for obvious reasons the matrix @xmath321 is called a `` hamiltonian matrix '' .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath321 can always be written as @xmath325 where @xmath326 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "note that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath321 are complex in general .    for the most general case ,",
    "hamiltonian matrices have no special properties which could profitably be used in the numerical diagonalization .",
    "an exception , however , is the case of a positive definite matrix @xmath327 , for which ( [ app2:1 ] ) is equivalent to an hermitian eigenvalue problem with pure imaginary eigenvalues . in order to show this , we note that a positive definite matrix can always be written as @xmath328 the so - called cholesky decomposition of @xmath326 , cf .",
    "substituting this in ( [ app2:1 ] ) and additionally defining @xmath329 we obtain @xmath330 now , @xmath323 is antisymmetric and therefore @xmath331 is hermitian .",
    "unfortunately , it is somehow difficult to use this equivalence directly for the purpose of numerical diagonalization .",
    "the cholesky decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix can be computed easily only for certain cases , otherwise it is very time consuming .",
    "for this reason we did not directly use formula ( [ app2:4 ] ) .",
    "instead we utilized a method called wielandt s version of the inverse iteration procedure .",
    "the basic strategy is to multiply a ( randomly chosen ) vector over and over by the inverse of the spectral - shifted matrix @xmath321 , i.e.   @xmath332 .",
    "the resulting series of vectors converges to an eigenvector of @xmath321 , usually the one corresponding to the eigenvalue closest to the chosen spectral shift @xmath333 .",
    "the details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for hamiltonian matrices , supposing a positive definite matrix @xmath326 and therefore imaginary eigenvalues and an imaginary spectral shift @xmath334 , wielandt s inverse iteration amounts to the following iteration formula : @xmath335 @xmath336 and @xmath337 are the real and imaginary part of the eigenvector in the @xmath338th iteration step .",
    "the initial vector @xmath339 must be choosen randomly .",
    "the matrix @xmath340 is a symplectic projection operator which is defined as @xmath341 the sum runs over all eigenvectors which were computed in previous runs .",
    "the purpose of this operator is to avoid that the method converges to an already - known eigenvector .",
    "after some iteration steps the parameter @xmath342 can also be iterated , for example according to the formula @xmath343 as @xmath344 converges to an eigenvector of @xmath321 , @xmath333 converges to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "a positive definite matrix @xmath326 is not a principal presumption for the inverse iteration , i.e. the above iteration formula can in principle be generalized to include the case of non - definite matrices @xmath326 .",
    "however , first of all , with @xmath326 , the coefficient matrix in ( [ app2:6 ] ) is also positive definite .",
    "this allows to use an efficient numerical method to solve ( [ app2:6 ] ) . to be precise",
    "we have used the nag library function f04mbf for this purpose which is based on a lanzcos algorithm .",
    "the nag routine makes it only necessary to supply a `` matrix@xmath345vector '' function .",
    "therefore one has to store only the elements of @xmath321 which are non - zero which precisely makes the method suitable for large and sparse matrix equation .",
    "a second point is that for non - definite @xmath326 rather serious problems with the numerical stability of the inverse iteration arise .",
