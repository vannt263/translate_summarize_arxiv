    "inspired by new possibilities offered by the cutting - edge nanotechnologies , the experimental and theoretical physics of increasingly sophisticated mesoscopic quantum devices ( heavily based on josephson junctions and their arrays ) is becoming one of the most exciting and rapidly growing areas of modern science ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for the recent reviews on charge and spin effects in mesoscopic 2d josephson junctions and quantum - state engineering with josephson - junction devices ) .",
    "in particular , a remarkable increase of the measurements technique resolution made it possible to experimentally detect such interesting phenomena as flux avalanches  @xcite and geometric quantization  @xcite as well as flux dominated behavior of heat capacity  @xcite in josephson junctions ( jjs ) and their arrays ( jjas ) .",
    "at the same time , given a rather specific magnetostrictive  @xcite and piezomagnetic  @xcite response of josephson systems , one can expect some nontrivial behavior of the thermal expansion ( te ) coefficient in jjs as well .",
    "of special interest are the properties of te in applied magnetic field .",
    "for example , some superconductors like @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were found  @xcite to exhibit anomalous temperature behavior of both magnetostriction and te which were attributed to the field - induced suppression of the superstructural ordering in the oxygen sublattices of these systems .    by introducing a concept of te of josephson contact ( as an elastic response of jj to an effective stress field ) , in the present paper",
    "we consider the temperature and magnetic field dependence of te coefficient @xmath6 in a small single jj and in a single plaquette ( a prototype of the simplest jja ) . in a short contact , the field - induced @xmath6",
    "is found to exhibit strong temperature oscillations near @xmath1 . at the same time , in an array ( described via a closed loop with finite self - inductance ) for these oscillations to manifest themselves , the applied field should be strong enough to overcome the screening induced self - field effects .",
    "since thermal expansion coefficient @xmath6 is usually measured using mechanical dilatometers  @xcite , it is natural to introduce te as an elastic response of the josephson contact to an effective stress field @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "namely , we define the te coefficient ( tec ) @xmath6 as follows : @xmath8 where an appropriate strain field @xmath9 in the contact area is related to the josephson energy @xmath10 as follows ( @xmath11 is the volume of the sample ) : @xmath12_{\\sigma = 0}\\ ] ] for simplicity and to avoid self - field effects , we start with a small josephson contact of length @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the josephson penetration depth ) placed in a strong enough magnetic field ( which is applied normally to the contact area ) such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the london penetration depth , and @xmath18 is an insulator thickness .",
    "the josephson energy of such a contact in applied magnetic field is governed by a fraunhofer - like dependence of the critical current  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the frustration parameter with @xmath21 being the flux through the contact area , @xmath22 is the initial phase difference through the contact , and @xmath23 is the zero - field tunneling josephson energy with @xmath24 being a characteristic ( decaying ) length and @xmath18 the thickness of the insulating layer . the neglected here self - field effects ( screening ) will be treated in the next section for an array .    notice that in non - zero applied magnetic field @xmath25 , there are two stress - induced contributions to the josephson energy @xmath10 , both related to decreasing of the insulator thickness under pressure . indeed , according to the experimental data  @xcite ,",
    "the tunneling dominated critical current @xmath26 in granular high-@xmath1 superconductors was found to exponentially increase under compressive stress , viz . @xmath27 .",
    "more specifically , the critical current at @xmath28 was found to be three times higher its value at @xmath29 , clearly indicating a weak - links - mediated origin of the phenomenon .",
    "hence , for small enough @xmath7 we can safely assume that  @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 being some characteristic value ( the parameter @xmath32 is related to the so - called ultimate stress @xmath33 as @xmath34 ) .",
    "as a result , we have the following two stress - induced effects in josephson contacts :    \\(i ) amplitude modulation leading to the explicit stress dependence of the zero - field energy @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and + ( ii ) phase modulation leading to the explicit stress dependence of the flux @xmath37 with @xmath38    finally , in view of eqs.(1)-(6 ) , the temperature and field dependence of the small single junction tec reads ( the initial phase difference is conveniently fixed at @xmath39 ) : @xmath40+\\epsilon ( t,0)\\frac{df(t , h)}{dt } , \\label{tecoefficient}\\ ] ] where @xmath41,\\ ] ] with @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 here , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .        for the explicit temperature dependence of @xmath47 we use the well - known  @xcite analytical approximation of the bcs gap parameter ( valid for all temperatures ) , @xmath48 with @xmath49 which governs the temperature dependence of the josephson critical current @xmath50 \\tanh \\left [ \\frac{\\delta ( t)}{2k_{b}t}\\right]\\ ] ] while the temperature dependence of the london penetration depth is governed by the two - fluid model : @xmath51        from the very structure of eqs.(1)-(9 )",
    "it is obvious that tec of a single contact will exhibit _ field _ oscillations imposed by the fraunhofer dependence of the critical current @xmath52 . much less obvious",
    "is its temperature dependence .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] presents the temperature behavior of the contact area strain field @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) for different values of the frustration parameter @xmath57 .",
    "notice characteristic flux driven temperature oscillations near @xmath1 which are better seen on a semi - log plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] which depicts the dependence of the properly normalized field - induced tec @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 for the same set of parameters .",
    "to answer an important question how the neglected in the previous section screening effects will affect the above - predicted oscillating behavior of the field - induced tec , let us consider a more realistic situation with a junction embedded into an array ( rather than an isolated contact ) which is realized in artificially prepared arrays using photolithographic technique ( that nowadays allow for controlled manipulations of the junctions parameters  @xcite ) .",
    "besides , this is also a good approximation for a granular superconductor ( if we consider it as a network of superconducting islands connected with each other via josephson links  @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to model and simulate the elastic response of such systems to an effective stress @xmath60 ( described in the previous section for an isolated contact ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider an array with a regular topology and uniform parameters ( such approximation already proved useful for describing high - quality artificially prepared structures  @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a planar square array as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the total current includes the bias current ( flowing through the vertical junctions ) and the induced screening currents ( circulating in the plaquette  @xcite ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to the inclusion of screening currents only into the nearest neighbors , neglecting thus the mutual inductance terms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the equation for the vertical contacts will read ( horizontal and vertical junctions are denoted by superscripts @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) :        @xmath63    where @xmath64 and the screening currents @xmath65 obey the fluxoid conservation condition : @xmath66    recall that the total flux has two components ( an external contribution and the contribution due to the screening currents in the closed loop ) and it is equal to the sum of the phase differences describing the array .",
    "it is important to underline that the external flux in eq.([fluxoid ] ) , @xmath67 , is related to the frustration of the whole array ( i.e. , this is the flux across the void of the network  @xcite ) , and it should be distinguished from the previously introduced applied magnetic field @xmath25 across the junction barrier which is related to the frustration of a single contact @xmath68 and which only modulates the critical current @xmath69 of a single junction while inducing a negligible flux into the void area of the array .      for simplicity , in what follows we will consider the elastic effects due to a uniform ( homogeneous ) stress imposed on the array . with regard to the geometry of the array",
    ", the deformation of the loop is the dominant effect with its radius @xmath70 deforming as follows : @xmath71 as a result , the self - inductance of the loop @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 being a geometry dependent factor ) will change accordingly : @xmath74 the relationship between the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that in addition to the critical current , the external stress will modify the resistance of the contact : @xmath79 as well as capacitance ( due to the change in the distance between the superconductors ) :    @xmath80    to simplify the treatment of the dynamic equations of the array , it is convenient to introduce the standard normalization parameters such as the josephson frequency :    @xmath81    the analog of the squid parameter :    @xmath82    and the dissipation parameter :    @xmath83    combining eqs.([currentcons - nostress ] ) and ( [ fluxoid ] ) with the stress - induced effects described by eqs .",
    "( [ resistance ] ) and ( [ capacitance ] ) and using the normalization parameters given by eqs.([omegaj])-([betac ] ) , we can rewrite the equations for an array in a rather compact form .",
    "namely , the equations for vertical junctions read : @xmath84 + \\gamma_b .",
    "\\label{arr - eq - vert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here an overdot denotes the time derivative with respect to the normalized time ( inverse josephson frequency ) , and the bias current is normalized to the critical current without stress , @xmath85 .    the equations for the horizontal junctions will have the same structure safe for the explicit bias related terms : @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{arr - eq - hor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , eqs.([arr - eq - vert ] ) and ( [ arr - eq - hor ] ) should be complemented with the appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite which will include the normalized contribution of the external flux through the plaquette area @xmath87 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that eqs.([arr - eq - vert ] ) and ( [ arr - eq - hor ] ) will coincide with their stress - free counterparts if we introduce the stress - dependent re - normalization of the parameters :    @xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92      turning to the discussion of the obtained numerical simulation results , it should be stressed that the main problem in dealing with an array is that the total current through the junction should be retrieved by solving self - consistently the array equations in the presence of screening currents .",
    "recall  @xcite that the josephson energy of a single junction for an arbitrary current @xmath93 through the contact reads :    @xmath94 . \\label{josenergybias}\\ ] ]    the important consequence of eq.([josenergybias ] ) is that if no current flows in the array s junction , such junction will not contribute to the tec ( simply because a junction disconnected from the current generator will not contribute to the energy of the system ) .    below we sketch the main steps of the numerical procedure used to simulate the stress - induced effects in the array :    * a bias point @xmath95 is selected for the whole array ; * the parameters of the array ( screening , josephson frequency , dissipation , etc ) are selected and modified according to the intensity of the applied stress @xmath60 ; * the array equations are simulated to retrieve the static configuration of the phase differences for the parameters selected in step @xmath96 ; * the total current flowing through the individual junctions is retrieved as : + @xmath97 * the energy dependence upon stress is numerically estimated using the value of the total current @xmath98 ( which is not necessarily identical for all junctions ) found in step @xmath99 via eq.([totalcurrent ] ) ; * the array energy @xmath100 is obtained by summing up the contributions of all junctions with the above - found phase differences @xmath101 ; * the stress - modified screening currents @xmath102 are computed by means of eq.([fluxoid ] ) and inserted into the magnetic energy of the array @xmath103 ; * the resulting strain field and te coefficient of the array are computed using numerical derivatives based on the finite differences : + @xmath104_{\\delta\\sigma \\rightarrow 0 } ,   \\label{estimstrain}\\ ] ] + @xmath105        the numerical simulation results show that the overall behavior of the strain field and te coefficient in the array is qualitatively similar to the behavior of the single contact . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we have simulated the behavior of both the small junction and the array as a function of the field across the barrier of the individual junctions in the presence of bias and screening currents .",
    "as is seen , the dependence of @xmath106 is very weak up to @xmath107 , showing a strong decrease of about @xmath108 when the frustration approaches @xmath109 .",
    "a much more profound change is obtained by varying the temperature for the fixed value of applied magnetic field .",
    "[ fig:5 ] depicts the temperature behavior of @xmath106 ( on semi - log scale ) for different field configurations which include barrier field @xmath110 frustrating a single junction and the flux across the void of the network @xmath111 frustrating the whole array .",
    "first of all , comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we notice that , due to substantial modulation of the josephson critical current @xmath112 given by eq.([josenergy ] ) , the barrier field @xmath110 has similar effects on the te coefficient of both the array and the single contact including temperature oscillations . however , finite screening effects in the array result in the appearance of oscillations at higher values of the frustration @xmath110 ( in comparison with a single contact ) . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b - d ) represent the influence of the external field across the void @xmath111 on the evolution of @xmath106 ( recall that in the absence of stress this field produces a well - defined magnetic pattern  @xcite ) . as is seen , in comparison with a field - free configuration ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) ) , the presence of external field @xmath111 substantially reduces the magnitude of the te coefficient of the array .",
    "besides , with @xmath111 increasing , the onset of temperature oscillations markedly shifts closer to @xmath1 .",
    "we have investigated the influence of a homogeneous mechanical stress on a small single josephson junction and on a plaquette ( array of @xmath2 junctions ) .",
    "we have shown how the stress - induced modulation of the parameters describing the junctions ( as well as the connecting circuits ) produces such an interesting phenomenon as a thermal expansion ( te ) in a single contact and two - dimensional array ( plaquette ) .",
    "we also studied the variation of the te coefficient with an external magnetic field and temperature .",
    "in particular , near @xmath1 ( due to some tremendous increase of the effective `` sandwich '' thickness of the contact ) the field - induced te coefficient of a small junction exhibits clear _ temperature _ oscillations scaled with the number of flux quanta crossing the contact area .",
    "our numerical simulations revealed that these oscillations may actually still survive in an array if the applied field is strong enough to compensate for finite screening induced self - field effects . and finally , it is important to emphasize that our analysis refers to regular arrays with square geometry ( similar to already existing artificially prepared arrays  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can argue that the predicted here effects should manifest themselves also in granular superconductors which exhibit quite pronounced stress dependent behavior upon mechanical loading  @xcite .",
