    "scientific communities have large , well - established , and relatively well structured digital footprints which have increasingly been the focus of specialized research .",
    "these footprints , composed of scholarly publications and related artifacts , have been employed for bibliometric analyses involving coauthorship , citation , co - citation , acknowledgments , and other such indicators of scientific productivity and knowledge production @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the majority of scientific publications are now available and consulted online , a number of recent analyses have progressively studied not only the production of scholarly artifacts but also their usage .",
    "recent studies include : an analysis of the structure of readership networks in the field of education research @xcite and a large - scale analysis of user request logs ( clickstreams ) gathered from scholarly web portals @xcite . in general ,",
    "these kinds of research are made possible because the scientific community is a large social institution that is open to investigation .",
    "coauthorship patterns are perhaps the most studied scholarly and scientific phenomena . recent studies of coauthorship have analyzed the literature production within specific domains such as high energy physics @xcite , genetic programming @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , nanoscience @xcite , library science @xcite , economics @xcite , organizational science @xcite , and psychology and philosophy @xcite .",
    "similar analyses have also been comparative in nature and have explored social and normative differences of coauthorship behavior across different domains @xcite . moreover",
    ", an increasing number of studies of this kind have accounted for the evolving component of scientific collaboration @xcite .",
    "more specifically , coauthorship patterns have been widely and actively studied from a social network analysis perspective for over two decades @xcite .",
    "most social network research involved with coauthorship is based upon this underlying concept : two individuals ( nodes ) are regarded as coauthors if they appear together in the author list of a publication ( edge ) .",
    "this relational structure works reasonably well when investigating coauthorship patterns in scholarly arrangements where publications are authored by relatively small groups .",
    "it is true that some scientific domains have experienced an increase in the number of authors per publication making it impossible to discern the nature and extent of individual contributions to a publication @xcite .",
    "a striking example of this phenomenon can be found in the domain of high - energy physics where author lists for a single publication often include tens or even hundreds of authoring researchers @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a number of recent studies of physics collaboration supplement traditional analytic techniques with more qualitative methods of survey research , i.e. , directly asking authors to indicate the real nature of their contributions to a publication @xcite .",
    "however , besides the singular case of high - energy physics , the vast majority of scholarly coauthorship networks incorporate collaboration circles of only a handful of authors per publication , suggesting that coauthorship activity can be adequately employed to construct a valid social network of collaboration @xcite .    in this article , we perform a temporal analysis of a coauthorship network constructed from the bibliographic record of a research center involved in the development and application of sensor network and wireless technologies .",
    "the network studied here is relatively small in size compared to networks generally analyzed in related research .",
    "the small size of the collaboration network results in a fundamental advantage : besides analyzing certain large - scale structural properties of the network , we can explore the social and academic arrangements in which collaboration patterns evolve , based on a set of node characteristics .    the study of node characteristics can provide insights into the level of `` homophily '' in a social network ,",
    "i.e. the tendency of individuals to create ties with similar others ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the homophily principle describes how homogeneous a network is in terms of specific sociodemographic , behavioral , or interpersonal characteristics .",
    "for example , a high level of homophily in a friendship network indicates that individuals with certain characteristics  such as race , ethnicity , political beliefs , and educational background  tend to make friends with individuals with similar characteristics .",
    "many studies of homophily are grounded in sociology and investigate patterns of homophily as well as their driving forces and their implications . an established method to measure mathematically",
    "the level of homophily in a network is by computing its `` assortativity '' ( also `` assortative mixing '' ) , i.e. , the extent of mixing between similar nodes in a network @xcite .",
    "while many different components of similarity can be investigated , the vast majority of large - scale studies of networks look at the mixing of node degree , i.e. how nodes with similar degree preferentially attach to one another . mixing patterns ,",
    "however , can also be calculated based on discrete node - specific characteristics . in studies of scholarly and scientific collaboration , examples of characteristics that have been investigated include research interests @xcite , academic domain @xcite , geographical location @xcite , age group @xcite , and country of origin @xcite of the individuals in the network . studying networks in terms of these node properties can offer insights into the mechanisms by which disciplinary , institutional , and spatial arrangements shape , and are shaped by , collaboration patterns .",
    "the present study , exploratory in nature , ties a quantitative analysis of a network s assortativity structure to a qualitative explanation of the social and academic landscape in which such network is embedded .",
    "scholars working with scientific collaboration networks are increasingly becoming interested in grounding their quantitative analyses in sociological theory .",
    "an example is the work of kretschmer & kretschmer @xcite that investigates whether the distribution of co - author pairs frequencies in a collaboration network can be regarded as a `` social gestalt '' .",
    "they derive a mathematical function to describe social gestalts in networks and apply it on four large scale coauthorship networks ( cumulative @xmath1 co - author pairs ) to explore the relationship between coauthorship and node - based author productivity .",
    "this study focuses on a much smaller collaboration network ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the small size of the network allows us to both perform a quantitative analysis of selected structural properties of the network and provide a a sociological explanation of our findings , based on an in - depth qualitative analysis of assortative mixing patterns .",
    "we demonstrate how certain social and academic dynamics , for example the emergence of new international collaborations or the inception of new inter - departmental efforts , have varying levels of control in the resulting topology and configuration of the scientific collaboration network .",
    "this article presents the findings of a study of scientific collaboration at the center for embedded networked sensing ( cens ) .",
    "cens is a national science foundation ( nsf ) science & technology center funded in 2002 .",
    "cens supports interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty , students , and staff of five partner universities in southern california : university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) ; university of southern california ( usc ) ; university of california , riverside ; california institute of technology ( caltech ) ; and university of california , merced . from 2005 , cens features a headquarter office base located within boelter hall at ucla .",
    "the mission of cens research is to use sensor network technology to reveal previously unobservable phenomena . from its inception , cens has developed and deployed sensor network devices for the study of a wide range of natural phenomena , such as seismic activity , fluid contaminant transport , and bird breeding behavior . besides these pursuits in the natural sciences ,",
    "the social and built environments have progressively become the focus of applied cens research : sensing mobile systems are being employed for the study of public health , environmental protection , urban planning , and cultural expression .",
    "the type of research conducted at cens now spans a wide spectrum of disciplines and applications ( from biology to seismology , from wireless telecommunications to statistics , from education to environmental science ) requiring continuous cooperation among individuals that , otherwise , would probably not interact beyond the walls of traditional university departments and faculties .",
    "in such a diverse scholarly and scientific landscape , distributed collaboration on multi - disciplinary subjects constitute a fundamental leverage for scientific research .",
    "computing the range , population and configuration of an interdisciplinary , multi - institutional research center like cens can be an arduous task .",

    ". however , as soon as one tries to be specific about the boundaries of a system , a number of difficulties become apparent '' @xcite .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in the case presented in this article , these difficulties have to do with the inherently open and dynamic nature of modern science research centers . unlike other types of organizational arrangements for which the boundaries are more or less evident ( e.g. academic institutions and departments , corporate and government centers ) , many modern research centers and laboratories act as umbrella organizations with very flexible and blurry boundaries .",
    "cens , for example , includes researchers from multiple institutions and disciplines .",
    "cens scholars seamlessly interact with each other within and beyond institutional and departmental boundaries : collaboration patterns are ubiquitous and non - uniformly distributed .",
    "researchers affiliated with cens may also be affiliated with other research laboratories and perform interdisciplinary work on other projects and under different affiliations . moreover , many cens collaborations include researchers that are not officially affiliated with the center .",
    "in other words , the nature and extent of contribution to cens collaboration depends on a number of organizational and scholarly factors , and is not solely restricted to individuals officially affiliated with the center . under these conditions ,",
    "what is the best way to construct a network that accurately captures scientific collaboration of this research center ?",
    "previous environment - specific studies of collaboration have delineated the population under study by relying on publication data contained in an institutional repository @xcite or domain - specific bibliographic databases @xcite to mine patterns of coauthorship that take place within a given institution or academic domain , respectively . for the purpose of this article",
    ", we used a similar mechanism , thus including in our population not only cens members , but also individuals that though not officially affiliated , have contributed to the production of cens or cens - related scholarly publications .",
    "we constructed a database of publications by assembling the items included yearly in the nsf annual reports , which contain the official list of documents published by cens for a given fiscal year .",
    "for the available reporting period ( 2002 through 2008 ) and for every publication , we collected the following information : a ) author names , b ) publication title , c ) publication type , d ) publication venue , and e ) publication date . for the purpose of this article , we utilized author names and publication dates ( years ) to construct a coauthorship network , i.e. a network consisting of individuals ( nodes ) that are connected to each other ( via edges ) if they are recorded as authors on the same scholarly publication .",
    "the resulting bibliographic dataset consisted of 547 manuscripts ( 370 conference proceedings , 159 journal articles , 17 book chapters and 1 book ) , published over a period of 7 years ( 20012007 ) .",
    "this bibliographic database was used to generate a weighted undirected network in which nodes represent authors and edges represent coauthorship activity among them .",
    "for example , if the present paper had to be included in this network , its authors ( pepe and rodriguez ) would become two distinct nodes , connected by an edge . in order to determine the weights between nodes , i.e. the strength of collaboration among coauthors , we used a weighting mechanism proposed by newman @xcite by which the weight of the edge between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is @xmath6 if author @xmath2 collaborated on paper @xmath7 ( and zero otherwise ) and @xmath8 is the number of coauthors of paper @xmath7 .",
    "for the example above , the edge between authors pepe and rodriguez would have @xmath9 .",
    "an article written by three authors ( e.g. , pepe , rodriguez , and bollen ) would result in three edges ( pepe - rodriguez , pepe - bollen , and rodriguez - bollen ) , each one with @xmath10 .",
    "and so on . as such",
    ", this weighting mechanism confers more weight to small and frequent collaborations , based on the assumptions that : i ) publications authored by a small number of individuals involve stronger interpersonal collaboration than multi - authored publications , and ii ) authors that have authored multiple papers together know each other better on average and thus collaborate more strongly than occasional coauthors @xcite .",
    "the resulting network data were `` sliced '' according to publication year yielding to @xmath11 separate networks , each one representing the cumulative collaborative effort of cens researchers up to that year .",
    "these networks of coauthorship for years from 2002 to 2007 are depicted in figure [ fig : networks ] ( a through f ) . in all depicted networks ,",
    "the diameter of each node is defined by its eigenvector centrality @xcite and the darker gray nodes denote individuals that are primarily affiliated with cens .      for each one of the coauthorship networks under study , for years 2001 through 2007 , we calculated some fundamental network statistics , presented in table [ tab : netstats ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         at the network s outset , the vast majority of collaborations is among americans and between americans and indian and chinese researchers . by year 2003 , the picture only changes slightly .",
    "more intra - national collaborations appear ( china - china and india - india ) , while inter - national collaborations between usa , india and china drop .",
    "these dynamics account for the growth of overall assortativity by country of origin recorded from 2001 to 2003 , and visible in figure [ fig : assort ] . by year 2007",
    ", the picture becomes more variegated .",
    "intra - national collaborations among american researchers still dominate",
    ". however , a number of novel inter - national collaborations emerge , namely between usa and italy , south korea , and iran . connecting this finding with the observation made in the previous section  that collaboration at cens was initially `` bootstrapped '' by faculty and later continued by graduate students and younger faculty  it is possible to infer that as soon as cens acquired a solid research core of collaboration , by year 2004 , it began to attract and involve collaborations by international graduate students , researchers and faculty .",
    "a great deal of research on scientific collaboration is performed on large - scale networks , constructed from bibliographic data harvested from domain - based and institutional document repositories . while these analyses rely on great quantities of data to study the structure , evolution and similar macroscopic features of scientific collaboration patterns , they often ignore certain contextual and microscopic factors , such as the social and academic arrangements in which collaboration takes place .",
    "this is because many available bibliographic datasets contain detailed publication metadata , but very little or no data about the authors writing those publications .    in this article",
    ", we perform a longitudinal analysis of the range , configuration and topology of a small network of scientific collaboration over a 7-year period .",
    "the network presented here is constructed from the bibliographic record of cens , a research center involved in the development and application of sensor network technologies . given the relatively small size of the network ( @xmath0 , in its largest year ) , we were able to manually collect additional metadata for every individual in the network studied .",
    "we used these node characteristics to explore the assortative mixing based on academic department , affiliation , position , and country of origin .",
    "our findings reveal that , in the period under study , the cens collaboration network : a ) becomes more assortative in terms of academic affiliation , i.e. more intra - institutional , b ) becomes less assortative in terms of academic department , i.e. more inter - disciplinary , c ) is not assortative in terms of academic position , i.e. collaboration patterns are not dependent on researchers academic positions , and d ) is only slightly assortative in terms of country of origin , i.e. the extent of inter - national collaboration decreases slightly over time .",
    "we interpreted our findings in terms of the specific components that constitute these mixing patterns , finding that a ) the increase in intra - institutional collaboration is possibly caused by cens research consolidating around its headquarter base at ucla , completed in 2004 ; b ) the increase in inter - disciplinarity is largely due to the shift a cens research agenda , to incorporate new domains , such as civil engineering and urban planning , besides the domains traditionally associated with sensor network research , i.e. , computer science and electrical engineering ; c ) cens research was initially dominated by collaborations between senior researchers , but as the center matured , it became more diversified and a core research component consisting of collaborating graduate students and young faculty emerged ; and d ) the volume of international collaboration between usa , india , and china decreased but new smaller international efforts began as the organization matured .",
    "this qualitative explanation of our findings revealed specific small - scale patterns that a quantitative analysis of assortativity alone would have failed to uncover .",
    "we speculate that supporting social network analyses with the proposed qualitative investigation of mixing patterns can provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics that shape ( and are in turn shaped ) by the changing socio - academic landscape in which scientific collaboration takes place .",
