    "we review the exact solution in closed form of [ 6 ] .",
    "a useful result of [ 6 ] is that each brane expands according to its canonical , effective expansion rate @xmath6 , that depends on the position of the brane in the fifth dimension . the 5th dimension is required to remain static during and after inflation .    in sec.3 we allow for matter in bulk and consider rolling branes . in the effective @xmath7 picture , the energy of the brane is replaced with a slow - roll potential ( inflation ) which comes to a steep end near the minimum , resulting in reheating . as expected , this requires a potential for stabilizing the radion during and after inflation .",

    "it is this relative separation that induces inflation on the branes with the slow - roll properties .",
    "it is assummed that the inflaton is very weakly coupled to the bulk modes because the radion is heavy .",
    "this fact avoids reheating of the extra dimension as well as overclosure of the universe from the kk excitations .",
    "it also preserves the success of bbn by ensuring that the radion has settled at its minimum and that the size of the extra dimension has not evolved since . for this to be the case , two requirements need be satisfied ( [ 5 ] ) : the radion stabilized by an effective potential @xmath8 must have a mass @xmath9 larger than the expansion rate @xmath10 ; and the brane must have negligible thickness otherwise the universe can not be treated as @xmath11 dimensional at distances of @xmath12 i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the size of the extra dimension .",
    "we consider a potential for the radion that satisfies the above requirements in sect.3 . and join the slow roll solution of [ 6 ] reviewed in sect.2 to the solution found in [ 7 ] that is valid during reheating , when branes reach the steep end in the potential .the number of e - foldings and the reheating temperature are calculated .",
