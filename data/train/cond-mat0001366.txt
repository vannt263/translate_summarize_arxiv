    "periodic boundary conditions are used throughout the following work .",
    "the second sum describes for @xmath10 an on - site coulomb repulsion between particles of opposite spin that share the same lattice site . in the present work we restrict ourselves to @xmath11 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath12 in the third sum controls the occupation of the finite lattice in the finite - temperature grand canonical quantum - monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulation we preformed . at half - filling , particle - hole symmetry of",

    "the 1-band hubbard model exhibits several energy scales : in the repulsive case the high - energy scale @xmath13 is important in determining the insulating gap at half - filling , @xmath15 .",
    "an important low - energy scale is set by the exchange interaction @xmath16 : in second order perturbation theory two particles with different spins on neighboring lattice sites can exchange via a virtual double occupation .",
    "this process is the source for the strong antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations found near and at half - filling .",
    "+ with the exception of some known symmetry properties like invariance under global spin - rotation , whose generators form the @xmath17algebra , and invariance under @xmath18-transformation , i.e. , charge - conservation , as well as the particle - hole transformation , no rigorous results are known for the 1-band hubbard model in two - dimensions @xcite .",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite prevents a long - range ordered state in a two - dimensional system for finite temperatures , but it is commonly believed that the ground state of the spin-@xmath19 heisenberg antiferromagnet , i.e. the large-@xmath13 limit of the repulsive half - filled hubbard model @xcite , shows long - range nel order in two dimensions .",
    "nel order results also in the weak - coupling limit @xcite , where the gap @xmath20 is due to a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) instability related to perfect nesting .",
    "+ it might seem that due to the mermin - wagner theorem the physics of the ordered phase is out of reach for our numerical technique , which is limited to finite temperatures .",
    "however , one may assume that the system ` effectively orders ' as soon as the spin - correlation length becomes comparable to the system size .",
    "due to the periodic boundary conditions the spin - correlation function @xmath21 is a periodic function of @xmath22 and if the value of this function at the maximum value @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 @xmath25 cluster size ) is still appreciable , we may expect that the system is ` effectively ordered ' .",
    "a rough measure would be the spin - correlation length @xmath26 , obtained by fitting @xmath27 to the form @xmath28 .",
    "since the infinite system has the nel temperature @xmath29 , the spin - correlation length diverges as @xmath30 and we may expect that in a _",
    "system @xmath26 becomes comparable to the cluster size @xmath24 at a _",
    "finite _ temperature which depends on the lattice size .",
    "below this temperature we then expect that the system resembles the ordered phase , although the spin - rotation symmetry persists even in this case . in that sense",
    ", the finite size of the system creates an artificial ` nel temperature ' which , however , depends on @xmath24 and @xmath31 etc and has no real counterpart in the infinite system .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when discussing the results .",
    "+ we proceed by discussing some known approximations to the hubbard model .",
    "the ` classical ' approximation to the hubbard model is the so - called hubbard - i approximation@xcite .",
    "its essence is the splitting of the electron annihilation operator into the two ` eigenoperators ' of the interaction part : @xmath32 whence @xmath33 the physical content of the hubbard - i approximation , which neglects any spin - correlations , becomes clear by realizing @xcite that the equations of motion in this approximation are completely equivalent to an ` effective hamiltonian ' for double occupancy - like particles @xmath34 and hole - like particles @xmath35 : @xmath36 this hamiltonian contains terms which describe the pair creation of a hole and a double occupancy on nearest neighbors @xmath9 , terms which describe the propagation of these effective particles , and an additional energy of formation of @xmath13 for the double occupancy .",
    "the matrix elements for the propagation are reduced by a factor of @xmath19 , because in an uncorrelated spin - background there is a probability of @xmath19 for the spin on a nearest neighbor to have the proper direction to allow for the hopping of an electron . solving ( [ hubeff ] ) by fourier and bogoliubov transform : @xmath37 yields the standard dispersion relation , which consists of the upper and lower hubbard bands : @xmath38 here @xmath39 denotes the free tight - binding dispersion @xmath40 . using ( [ interactioneigenoperators ] ) we also obtain the correct spectral weights of the two hubbard bands : @xmath41 as noted above , the key assumption in the hubbard i approximation is the neglect of spin - correlations .",
    "therefore , we expect that this approximation will become inaccurate as soon as spin - correlations become sufficiently strong so as to appreciably influence the propagation of holes and double occupancies",
    ". this effect will be strongest in the nel ordered phase believed to be realized in the ground state .",
    "if we choose the ` spin - background ' , in which the holes and double occupancies propagate , to be the nel state , the double occupancy @xmath42 with spin @xmath43 can exist only on the @xmath44 sublattice and vice versa .",
    "similarly , a hole @xmath45 can be created only on the @xmath44 sublattice and vice versa .",
    "we , thus , expect that we have to modifiy the hubbard - i hamiltonian ( [ hubeff ] ) into : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) denotes the @xmath44 ( @xmath43 ) sublattice and @xmath49 denotes the set of nearest neighbors of site @xmath6 .",
    "note that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 propagation terms drop out ( because of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 sublattices ) , and the matrix element for pair creation are @xmath8 rather than @xmath52 - this takes into account the fact that the spins on neighboring sites are antiparallel with probability @xmath53 rather than @xmath19 as was the case in the paramagnetic state .",
    "fourier and bogoliubov transformation of ( [ swham ] ) yields the dispersion @xmath54 and using @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is within the af brillouin zone ) , we find the spectral weight of these bands : @xmath57 this is precisely what is obtained from the sdw mean - field treatment of the hubbard model by setting the staggered magnetization @xmath58 to a value of @xmath53 ( which is a good approximation in the limit of large @xmath13 ) . in general , the sdw mean - field approximation models the af nel state by assuming @xmath59 with af nesting vector @xmath60 and staggered magnetization @xmath61@xcite .",
    "this results in the two - band dispersion @xmath62 and the spectral weight @xmath63 the gap parameter is @xmath64 and the staggered magnetization @xmath58 is determined self - consistently from the following equation : @xmath65 the solution of this self - consistency equation yields the value @xmath66 at @xmath11 , the value used in the present work .",
    "if we set @xmath67 on the other hand , as would be apropriate for @xmath68 , we obviously recover the results from our hubbard - i - like hamiltonian ( [ swham ] ) .",
    "+ in the two limiting cases of no spin - correlations and of perfect nel order we can thus treat the hubbard model in a quite analogous fashion and , as will be seen below , the hubbard - i results are indeed a good approximation to the actual spectral function in the limit of high temperature .",
    "the main problem then is how to describe the effect of spin - fluctuations and how to manage the crossover from the completely disordered to the nel ordered phase .",
    "below , we will adress this crossover by qmc simulations .",
    "+ thereby we want to take advantage of the possibility to calculate the spectra of specifically designed ` diagnostic operators ' .",
    "the first one of these is the _ `",
    "shadow ' operator _ : @xmath69 we note first of all , that the fourier transform of this operator , @xmath70 has precisely the same quantum numbers as the ordinary electron operator @xmath71 : momentum @xmath72 , total spin @xmath19 , @xmath73-spin @xmath5 , and identical point group symmetry at high symmetry momenta .",
    "it follows that the poles in its dynamical correlation functions @xmath74 originate from exactly the same final states @xmath75 as those of the photoemission spectrum .",
    "it can happen only accidentally that a given state @xmath76 has an exactly vanishing weight in one of the correlation functions , but not the others . in this case , however , any arbitrarily small perturbation will remove the accidental vanishing of the peak .",
    "the only thing that can and will be different in the spectra of the diagnostic operator , are the _ weights _ of the peaks , @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , comparison of equations ( [ crep ] ) and ( [ hubihafwght ] ) shows immediately that both for the hubbard i approximation and for the sdw - approximation use of the operator @xmath70 instead of @xmath71 exchanges the weights of the two hubbard / sdw bands .",
    "it follows that band portions which have a small spectral weight in the spectra of the ordinary electron operator will aquire a large spectral weight in the spectrum of @xmath70 and vice versa . therefore , this diagnostic operator is a useful tool to map out the ` shadowy ' parts of the spectra in the outer parts of the brillouin zone .",
    "an additional benefit is that since the me technique resolves peaks with large spectral weight more reliably than those with small weight , we can get more precise information about the dispersion of these bands with weak intensity .",
    "the second diagnostic operator that we will be using is the _ `",
    "spin-@xmath19 string ' operator _",
    "@xmath78 where the sum on the r.h.s .",
    "runs over the nearest neighbors @xmath79 of site @xmath6 .",
    "this operator is the clebsch - gordan contraction of the adjoint rank-@xmath53 spinor @xmath80 and the spin-@xmath53 vector operator @xmath81 into yet another adjoint rank-@xmath53 spinor .",
    "it describes the annihilation of a ` dressed ' electron , i.e. , an electron with a spin - excitation on a nearest neighbor .",
    "again , since the fourier transforms of the diagnostic operator , @xmath82 , agrees with the electron annihilation operator @xmath71 in all conceivable quantum numbers ( momentum , total spin , @xmath73-component of the spin , point group operations in the case of high symmetry momenta ) , it obeys precisely the same selection rules , whence it is just as good as the @xmath83-operator itself to map out the band structure .",
    "+ one further point , which is important from the technical point of view , is the following : under the particle - hole transformation @xmath84 we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that at half - filling the spectra of the shadow and spin-@xmath19 string operator obey the same particle - hole - symmetry as those of the ordinary electron operator , i.e. @xmath87 in our maxent program particle - hole - symmetry is not implemented as an additional constraint , in other words : the maxent procedure does not ` know ' about this additional symmetry .",
    "the degree to which ( [ phsym ] ) is obeyed in the final spectra thus gives a good check for the accuracy of the reconstructed spectra .",
    "this is of particular importance in the case of the spin-@xmath19 string operator because the wick - contraction of this operator on any given time slice produces a total of @xmath88 products of noninteracting green s functions .",
    "the computation is , therefore , much more prone to inaccuracies so that an additional check is desirable .",
    "+ the present work is organized as follows :",
    "first , we compare the temperature dependent dynamic single - particle properties of the hubbard model with the predicitions of the mean - field sdw and hubbard - i approximations .",
    "in addition , we consider the temperature dependent two - particle excitations",
    ". then , we will use our first diagnostic operator , the shadow operator @xmath70 , to show the existence of a total of four bands in the photoemission spectrum and to shed light onto the temperature dependent crossover from the sdw to the hubbard - i regime .",
    "then we will investigate the 4-band structure in more detail : after a phenomenological fit , which is able to produce a total of four bands , we will consider the string picture which naturally leads to our second diagnostic operator , the spin-@xmath19 string operator @xmath82 . this operator will be used to ultimately reveal the underlying mechanisms behind the generation of the 4-band structure , namely the dressing of the photoholes by clouds of af spin - excitations . to resolve the ` af mirror image ' of the narrow quasiparticle spectral weight features between @xmath89 and @xmath90 around momentum @xmath91",
    "we introduce also a spin-@xmath92 string operator .",
    "finally , we will concentrate on the doped regime , thereby showing the violation of the luttinger theorem near half - filling , and discuss the hole concentration range in which these dressing effects dominante the low - energy physics .",
    "we start in figure [ fig1 ] with the discussion of the angle - resolved single - particle spectral function @xmath93 for @xmath11 and various temperatures in the range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . in the left column of the figure",
    "the spectral functions are shown as ` grey - scale ' plots versus momentum @xmath96 and energy @xmath97 with dark ( light ) areas corresponding to large ( small ) spectral weight .",
    "the same spectra are shown also in the right column , but now as line - plots at each momentum @xmath96 .",
    "the qmc data in the figure are compared to the renormalized results of the hubbard - i approximation at high and medium temperatures and with the renormalized results of the mean - field sdw approximation at the lowest temperature , @xmath95 . `",
    "renormalized ' means here that we have readjusted the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath8 in ( [ hubihafdisp ] ) and ( [ sdwdisp])so as to obtain an optimal fit to the ` bands ' of high spectral weight in the spectra .",
    "these approximate dispersions are plotted as solid lines in the left column , while their spectra are shown in the right column as line - plots at each momentum @xmath96 .",
    "thereby we have assumed a lorentzian lineshape with a suitably chosen temperature dependent width ( the hubbard - i approximation does not provide any information about linewidths ) .",
    "+ starting at the highest calculated temperature , @xmath94 , we find that the hubbard - i approximation with practically unrenormalized parameters ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) fits the qmc spectral functions almost perfectly regarding both the general dispersion and the distribution of spectral weight ( quadratic deviation per degree of freedom @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the hubbard - i approximation is derived for the paramagnetic state thereby neglecting all effects of spin - correlations , i.e. , the hubbard - i approximation essentially describes the interplay between itinerant electrons and strong on - site repulsion .",
    "this should be a reasonable assumption at this high temperature since all relevant spin - degrees of freedom are thermally excited .",
    "+ lowering the temperature to @xmath101 and further to @xmath102 , the data show that the hubbard - i approximation increasingly fails to reproduce the entire spectrum and is only able to fit the peaks with maximal spectral weight reasonably well . even then , in order to achieve these fits , one already has to renormalize the free parameters strongly .",
    "the values we found are @xmath103 and @xmath104 with @xmath105 at @xmath101 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 at @xmath102 .",
    "the peaks that are missed by the hubbard - i approximation are the states that form the first ionization / affinity states around momentum @xmath109 on the photoemission / inverse photoemission side and two rather dispersionless bands at higher energies of @xmath110 .",
    "the former states were previously resolved by preuss and co - workers @xcite .",
    "alltogether one can distinguish a total of four ` bands ' in the single particle spectral density . as will be seen below , the temperature / doping regime where this 4-band structure is seen coincides with the regime where a collective low - energy mode with momentum @xmath111 in the spin - response exists .",
    "inspite of this , however , we stress that the 4-band structure can not be explained by a backfolding of the band structure due to ordering effects since the spin - correlation length is @xmath112 lattice spacings at temperatures @xmath113 .",
    "+ for the lowest temperature , @xmath95 , the qmc data are compared with the results from the af sdw approximation . as in the case of the hubbard - i approximation at medium temperatures , the lowermost spectra of figure [ fig1 ] show that the sdw approximation is only able to fit the peaks with large spectral weight .",
    "again one has to renormalize the free parameters heavily to values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , as was the case for the hubbard - i approximation at higher temperatures , the sdw approximation neither explains the states that form the first ionization / affinity states around momentum @xmath109 on the photoemission / inverse photoemission side , nor the two dispersionless bands at higher excitation energies which can be seen rather clearly in the spectra .",
    "+ all in all , the overall distribution of spectral weight is roughly reproduced by the hubbard - i and sdw approximations as long as one forgets about the 4-band structure .",
    "in fact it is well known that the _ integrated _ photoemission or inverse photoemission weight ( that means the electron momentum distribution ) at each @xmath96point is reproduced quite well by the hubbard - i approximation and the related @xmath117-pole approximation@xcite .",
    "+ as already mentioned , the emerging of the 4-band structure in the photoemission somewhere in between @xmath101 and @xmath102 is closely related to a change in the spin - response : to illustrate this we consider figure [ fig2 ] , which shows the spin - correlation function , @xmath118 ( left column ) , and the charge - correlation function , @xmath119 ( right column ) , for different temperatures . whereas the spin - response is entirely incoherent at @xmath101 , with decreasing temperature it can be fitted increasingly well by the spin - wave dispersion @xmath120 this result is known from previous calculations @xcite , which demonstrated that the two - particle correlation functions like the spin - response can be described within the sdw approximation even for large values of the interaction @xmath13 .",
    "the energy scale @xmath121 directly manifests itself in the spin - response since the spin - wave dispersion takes the value of @xmath122 at momentum @xmath90 .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath123 with @xmath124 at @xmath102 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 at @xmath127 .",
    "the latter is already quite close to the strong coupling estimate @xmath128 .",
    "furthermore , the figure shows that with decreasing temperature the spin - response concentrates its weight more and more at the af momentum @xmath60 ( as it is the case in af spin - wave theory ) and at a characteristic energy @xmath129 .",
    "the latter decreases with decreasing temperature , i.e. , the spin - response comes closer and closer to the predictions of af spin - wave theory ( [ spinwave ] ) .",
    "the spin - correlation length @xmath130 can be derived from a real - space fit of the qmc equal - imaginary - times spin - correlation function @xmath27 to the form @xmath131 thereby incorporating the effects of the periodic boundary conditions . while this is the best one can do on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the fit will only lead to roughly correct values due to the relative small system size of @xmath132 .",
    "the values obtained for the spin - correlation length then are @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "we actually believe that the spin - correlation length reaches the system size already at a temperature of @xmath140 , because at this temperature the fit results in values between @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( with the exponent @xmath143 set to zero or not ) but always with error bars of roughly the system size . +",
    "the charge - response @xmath119 , on the other hand , is rather broad in both momentum @xmath96 and energy @xmath144 for all temperatures studied .",
    "furthermore , the charge - response is gapped for temperatures below @xmath145 and , therefore , can certainly not be responsible for any low - energy features of the single particle spectrum . + it is then quite obvious that at roughly the same temperature where the two narrow dispersive quasiparticle - like bands ( that can not be interpreted within the framework of the hubbard - i or sdw approximations ) appear in the single particle spectrum , the spin - response develops a sharp collective low - energy mode .",
    "we conclude that the underlying mechanism behind the occurrence of the 4-band structure consists in dynamical magnetic correlation effects , which are beyond the scope of the hubbard - i and sdw approximations .",
    "+ in the following , we want to explore the single particle spectrum by means of our _ diagnostic operators_. the first of them is the shadow operator @xmath146 of equation ( [ shadoweqt ] ) which will be used to transfer spectral weight from the inner parts of the brillouin zone to the outer ones in case of normal photoemission @xmath147 .",
    "as already discussed above , this also improves the resolution of the me method in this region , since its resolution strongly depends on the spectral weight at a certain position .",
    "nevertheless the spectrum of the shadow operator has to exhibit exactly the same peak positions as the normal photoemission spectrum .",
    "+ figure [ fig3 ] shows the angle - resolved spectral function of the shadow operator for moderate and low temperatures .",
    "as expected , the shadow operator has its main spectral weight near @xmath91 on the photoemission side and near @xmath89 on the inverse photoemission side .",
    "furthermore , it s spectrum supports the existence of a total of four bands , because it resolves a group of peaks forming dispersionless bands at energies of @xmath148 , a region where the normal photoemission spectrum exhibits only some weak and smeared - out spectral weight .",
    "these two dispersionless bands at energies of @xmath110 are inconsistent with the dispersions of the hubbard - i and sdw approximations of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we will further address this topic later in this work .",
    "+ next , we turn in more detail to the temperature dependence of the photoemission spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows some close - ups of the normal photoemission spectrum and of the spectrum of the shadow operator at momentum @xmath91 and different temperatures . for the normal photoemission operator",
    "these close - ups show a peak at @xmath149 , which would be consistent with hubbard - i ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . in the spectrum of the shadow operator",
    "this feature is visible as a single resolved peak only at the highest temperature , @xmath101 whereas for temperatures down to @xmath139 there is only some diffuse weight at this position . in the ordinary photoemisson spectrum the peak looses spectral weight with decreasing temperature .",
    "it disappears completely at @xmath150 where the spin - correlation length @xmath130 reaches the system size ( see above ) .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath140 where we lose the hubbard - i - like peak at @xmath149 and @xmath91 coincides quite accurately with the temperature where ` effective ' long - range order sets in .",
    "moreover , we find that as the normal photoemission spectrum loses the peak at @xmath149 and @xmath91 , the spectrum of the shadow operator gains weight at @xmath151 . thus , we expect that both features are closely related to the temperature development of the spin - correlation length @xmath130 .",
    "we note , however , that the crossover in the shape of the dispersion from hubbard - i - like to sdw - like occurs in a quite unexpected way : the topmost band at @xmath111 does _ not _ deform into the sdw form in any continuous way , but simply ` fades away ' and eventually vanishes at the transition .",
    "+ a further surprising result is the following : at @xmath152 neither the ordinary electron operator nor the shadow operator pick up the ` af umklapp band ' corresponding to the narrow dispersive band seen for example at @xmath153 for @xmath154 , i.e. there is no corresponding band at @xmath153 and @xmath155 .",
    "note that in the framework if the sdw - approximation the shadow operator _ must _ reproduce this umklapp - band at @xmath111 with the _ same weight _ as the original band at @xmath156 in the ordinary photoemission spectrum - see the discussion in the first section . that this is",
    "not the case shows that even at this lowest temperature , a simple sdw - like description of the band structure is invalid , in that the band structure can not be understood by simple backfolding of the spectrum obtained without broken symmetry . as we will see in the following the af sdw state provides only the ` background ' for the dressing of the photoholes with af spin - excitations which dynamically generate a total of four bands .",
    "we return to the discrepancy between the 2-band dispersions of the hubbard - i and sdw approximations and the 4-band structure actually observed for example in the spectrum of the shadow operator of figure [ fig3 ] . + in order to generate a ` 4-band structure ' out of the two bands of the hubbard - i and sdw approximations we try as a phenomenological ansatz to mix the dispersions of the hubbard - i / sdw approximation with two dispersionless bands at energies of @xmath157 . in other words , for both the photoemission and inverse photoemission spectrum we diagonalize an ` effective ' @xmath158 hamilton matrix : @xmath159 and plot in figure [ fig5 ] the four bands obtained in this way on top of the spectral density obtained from qmc at @xmath160 and @xmath95 . for comparison",
    "the figure also shows the original ( i.e. unhybridized ) hubbard - i bands plus the two phenomenological dispersionless bands at energies of @xmath161 .",
    "the figure shows that the overall agreement between the qmc peak positions and the four bands generated by diagonalizing @xmath162 of equation ( [ mixeqt1 ] ) is surprisingly good , particularly so in view of the fact that for both , hubbard - i and sdw approximation , only _",
    "unrenormalized _ parameters were used . in particular , the _ self - consistently _ determined value for the sdw gap @xmath20 of @xmath163 was used at @xmath95 .",
    "the only ` external ' parameter in this figure is the mixing matrix element @xmath164 , which was set to a value of @xmath165 .",
    "+ thus , we find in contrast to previous works @xcite , that the introduction of the dispersionless bands reproduces the sinlge - particle gap and the width of the quasiparticle band correctly without any renormalization of parameters .",
    "rather , the narrowing of the quasiparticle band and the reduction of the hubbard gap as compared to the unrenormalized parameters is brought about by introduction of the dispersionless bands .",
    "this naturally raises the question as to their physical origin . in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to a more phenomenological and ` numerics based ' approach . a complementary and more mathematical discussion is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an equation of motion approach similar to hubbard s original work is pursued .",
    "+ we consider the commutator of the creation operator for hole - like particles , @xmath166 , which annihilates a particle only on a singly occupied site , with the kinetic energy of the hubbard model and find@xcite : @xmath167 keeping only the first term in the square brackets of equation ( [ commute ] ) reproduces the hubbard - i approximation @xcite .",
    "the second term in the square brackets describes the dressing of the created hole by a spin - excitation and is closely related to the spin-@xmath19 string operator of equation ( [ stringoperator ] ) .",
    "the third term describes in an analogous fashion the coupling of the hole to a density fluctuations , whereas the fourth term describes the coupling to the @xmath168-excitation@xcite .",
    "the two latter types of excitation are not important for a large positive @xmath13 near half - filling , @xmath15 , and will be neglected .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath169 is in this case the most important correction over the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "as already stated , it describes a hole dressed by a spin - excitation : this operator not only creates a hole on site @xmath79 but dresses this hole with a spin - excitation on a neighboring site , which is exactly the idea behind the spin - bag@xcite or spin - polaron@xcite pictures known in the literature .",
    "+ splitting this operator into eigenoperators of @xmath170 : @xmath171 we find @xmath172 = \\frac{u}{2 } \\hat{d}_{i , j,\\sigma}$ ] and @xmath173 = - \\frac{u}{2 } \\hat{c}_{i , j,\\sigma}$ ] .",
    "assuming moreover that the mobility of these composite excitations is determined by the ` heavy ' spin - excitation , it seems quite resonable to assume that these ` particles ' are the source of the ( more or less ) dispersionless bands at @xmath174 .",
    "+ finally , the commutation relation ( [ commute ] ) shows that the mixing matrix element between the @xmath175 and the new composite particles should be @xmath176 . based on these rough considerations",
    "we might thus expect that the two string-@xmath53 ` effective particles ' ( [ eigy ] ) are excellent candidates for explaining the two dispersionless bands at @xmath177 required to upgrade the hubbard - i or sdw approximation so as to match the qmc data .",
    "however , so far the above considerations are pure speculation and in the following we will turn to qmc - results to back up this hypothesis by numerical evidence .",
    "+ before doing so , however , we want to illustrate the action of the ` string - operator ' in two extreme cases : an ideal nel state and a resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) state , i.e. a compact singlet covering of the plane@xcite ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) . in the nel state , a hole created initially on site @xmath6 can travel one place to a neighboring site @xmath79 thereby leaving behind a misaligned spin on the original site @xmath6 .",
    "exactly this process is described by the second term , @xmath178 : it creates a hole of opposite spin on a neighboring site @xmath79 and flips the spin on the original site @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , this process corresponds to the creation of a string of length @xmath53 .",
    "in fact one might think about more sophisticated diagnostic operators incorporating the effects of longer - ranged strings @xcite .",
    "indeed , dagotto and schrieffer@xcite and eder and ohta@xcite already measured the angle - resolved spectrum of a diagnostic operator containing strings with up to three lattice sites range by means of exact diagonalizations of the @xmath179 model .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , in the qmc method each observable has to be expressed in terms of free single - particle greens functions on each time slice by the application of wicks theorem @xcite .",
    "this results already in a quite large expression for the spin-@xmath19 string operator of equation ( [ stringoperator ] ) containing approximately @xmath180 contributions .",
    "the implementation of even longer - ranged string operators therefore was not possible .",
    "+ returning to the spin-@xmath19 string operator of equation ( [ stringoperator ] ) we note that the first term , @xmath181 will always annihilate a nel state .",
    "this reflects the simple fact that spin - rotation symmetry is broken in the nel state .",
    "this is not the case , however , in the fully rotationally invariant rvb state : again , creating a hole on site @xmath6 and allowing it to hop to site @xmath79 will produce a spin - excitation .",
    "however , in the case of the rvb state , it produces the superposition of two states : in one case the dotted ellipse stands for the @xmath182 component of the triplet , and this state would again be created by the term @xmath178 .",
    "there is , however , also a second state where the dotted ellipse corresponds to the superposition of a singlet and the @xmath183 component of the triplet .",
    "this second state then would be created by the term @xmath181 , whereby the relative sign of the two terms in the string-1 operator makes sure that the two configurations are always produced with the proper phase . in both extreme cases , nel state and ` singlet soup ' , the string-@xmath53 operator thus creates a hole dressed with the proper spin - excitation : this scan be a spin wave ( i.e. a single inverted spin ) in the case of a nel state , or a singlet - triplet excitation in the case of an rvb state .",
    "+ as a technical remark we still note that the excessive numerical effort which would have been necessary to compute spectra for the @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( which are products of @xmath186 fermion operators ) has made it impossible to compute the spectra of these operators - instead we have been using the ( fourier transform of ) the operator @xmath187 , defined in ( [ stringoperator ] ) . concerning the difference between this diagnostic operator and the operator @xmath188 obtained by commuting @xmath189 with the kinetic energy ( see the second term on the r.h.s . of equation ( [ commute ] ) ) , we note that their fourier transforms differ only by phase factors of the form @xmath190 .",
    "both operators are indeed identical at momentum @xmath89 and differ at momentum @xmath91 only by a factor of @xmath191 since @xmath192 and @xmath193 are next - nearest neighbor lattice sites . at all other momenta",
    "both operators have exactly the same peaks but will differ somewhat in their spectral weights .",
    "+ after these remarks we discuss the angle - resolved spectral function of the spin-@xmath19 string operator @xmath194 , shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the spectrum of the spin-@xmath19 string operator indeed picks up those band portions which , according to the rough hybridization scenario in figure [ fig5 ] , should have strong ` flat - band character ' , i.e. the part of the narrow low energy band between @xmath156 and @xmath195 and between @xmath156 and @xmath196 at energies @xmath153 . we note that these are precisely the positions where the two quasiparticle - like dispersive narrow bands occurred in the normal photoemission spectrum at @xmath102 .",
    "in addition , the band portion at @xmath197 for momentum @xmath111 is also enhanced in the string-1 spectrum .",
    "+ this , however , still leaves an important part of the band structure unexplained .",
    "namely , the ` af umklapp band ' of the narrow quasiparticle band dispersing upward between @xmath156 and @xmath195 at @xmath153 still is not seen in any of the spectra , not even at the lowest temperature studied . on the other hand , in a state with true antiferromagnetically broken symmetry we know that this mirror image must exist due to the backfolding of the brillouin zone . to finally resolve this part",
    ", we now introduce the last diagnostic operator of this work , which we call the spin-@xmath92 string operator : @xmath198 this describes again a composite object of a hole and a spin - excitation , but this time the two constituents are coupled to the total spin of @xmath92 .",
    "we stress that this operator will detect states which can never be seen in an actual angle - resolved photoemission spectrum on a singlet ground state , because this is forbidden by the angular - momentum selection rule .",
    "the angle - resolved spectral function @xmath199 of the spin-@xmath92 string operator is plotted in figure [ fig8 ] again for @xmath102 ( top ) and @xmath95 ( bottom ) .",
    "it is then immediately obvious that it is this operator which resolves the ` missing piece ' of the af dispersion , i.e. the ` af mirror image ' of the narrow quasiparticle band .",
    "it should also be noted that the spectrum of @xmath200 is remarkably independent of temperature , i.e. the states belonging to this ` spin-@xmath92 band ' persist irrespectively of whether there is long - range order or not .",
    "+ combining the information obtained so far , suggests the following scenario for the crossover between the paramagnetic band structure at high temperature and the af band structure at low temperature : in the paramagnetic state at high temperatures ( such as @xmath102 ) , the spin is a good quantum number and the spin-@xmath92 ` band ' does exist but can not mix with any spin-@xmath19 band due to spin - conservation .",
    "the band of spin-@xmath92 quasiparticles thus plays no role whatsoever in the actual photoemission spectrum , which is presumably the reason why the outer part of the spectrum is so remarkably ` invisible ' in actual arpes experiments , leading to the idea of a ` remnant fermi surface ' in the insulator@xcite . reaching this state by photoemission",
    "would only be possible if the photohole is created in a thermally admixed state of at least spin @xmath53 . in an infinite system",
    "this situation changes discontinuously at the transition to the true broken symmetry state : there the total spin ceases to be a good quantum number , and the spin-@xmath19 band in the interior of the af zone and the spin-@xmath92 band in the exterior now suddenly can mix with each other , thus leading to the familiar sdw dispersion .",
    "we note that another way to generate a coupling between these two bands would be application of a magnetic field - this also would break spin - rotation invariance and hence enable the hybridization of a spin-@xmath19 and a spin-@xmath92 band . based on our results",
    "we thus believe that a magnetic field could enhance the spectral weight of the ` shadow part ' of the band structure as seen in arpes .",
    "summarizing our results so far , we may say that the hubbard - i approximation , slightly improved by the introduction of new quasiparticles corresponding to dressed holes provides a very good description of the spectral function for the case of half - filling , @xmath201 . in this section",
    "we want to proceed to the doped case @xmath202 , which is of prime interest for cuprate superconductors . here",
    ", an essential drawback of the qmc procedure is that reliable qmc simulations for lower temperatures are much more difficult or even impossible , since the absence of particle - hole symmetry away from half - filling introduces the notorious minus - sign problem into the algorithm .",
    "truely low temperatures like @xmath203 , which in principle correspond to the physical temperature range , are therefore out of reach .",
    "on the other hand in the study of the half - filled case we have seen that a major change takes place as the spin correlation length reaches the system size , whence ` effective long range order ' sets in . in the doped case the spin correlation length is expected to be short at any temperature , whence we may expect that the change of @xmath93 from high to small temperature is more smooth than at half - filling . in that sense ,",
    "even @xmath93 data for the relatively high temperature @xmath102 are interesting to study .",
    "moreover , we can at least try to elucidate trends with decreasing temperature and thus construct a reasonably plausible scenario .",
    "+ at half - filling , we have seen that the ` approximation of choice ' for the paramagnetic case was the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "this naturally poses the question as to how relevant the half - filled case is for the description of the doped case , i.e. how much of the hubbard - i physics remains valid for finite doping . at half - filling the two ` effective particles ' @xmath204 and @xmath205 ,",
    "form the two separate hubbard bands .",
    "the effect of doping would now consist in the chemical potential cutting progressively into the top of the lower hubbard band , in much the same fashion as in a doped band insulator . on the other hand , for finite @xmath31 the spectral weight along this band deviates from the free - particle value of @xmath53 per momentum and spin so that the fermi surface volume ( obtained from the requirement that the integrated spectral weight up to the fermi energy be equal to the total number of electrons ) is not in any ` simple ' relationship to the number of electrons - the luttinger theorem must be violated .",
    "this is the major reason why the hubbard - i approximation has been dismissed by many authors as being unphysical .",
    "+ we now wish to address the question as to what really happens if a paramagnetic ( i.e. not magnetically ordered ) insulator is doped away from half - filling , by qmc simulation .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath206 and @xmath11 .",
    "+ figure [ fig9 ] then shows the development of @xmath207 with doping .",
    "it is quite obvious from this figure that initially the @xmath117 bands seen at half - filling in the photoemission spectrum ( i.e. @xmath208 ) persist with an essentially unchanged dispersion .",
    "the chemical potential gradually cuts deeper and deeper into the topmost band , forming a hole - like fermi surface centered on @xmath111 , the top of the lower hubbard band .",
    "the only deviation from a rather simple rigid - band behavior is an additional transfer of spectral weight : the part of the topmost band near @xmath111 gains in spectral weight , whereas the band with higher binding energy looses weight . in addition , there is a transfer of weight from the upper hubbard band to the inverse photoemission part below the hubbard gap .",
    "this effect is actually quite well understood@xcite .",
    "the band structure above the hubbard gap becomes more diffuse upon hole doping in that the rather clear two - band structure visible near @xmath111 at half - filling rapidly gives way to one broad ` hump ' of weight .",
    "apart from the spectral weight transfer , however , the band structure on the photoemission side is almost unaffected by the hole doping - the _ dispersion _ of the quasiparticle band becomes somewhat wider but does not change appreciably . in that sense",
    "we see at least qualitatively the behavior predicted by the hubbard i approximation .",
    "+ next , we focus on the fermi surface volume .",
    "some care is necessary here : first , we can not actually be sure that at the high temperature we are using there is still a well - defined fermi surface .",
    "second , the criterion we will be using is the crossing of the quasiparticle band through the chemical potential .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that this may be quite misleading , because band portions with tiny spectral weight are ignored in this approach ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "when thinking of a fermi surface as the constant energy contour of the chemical potential , we have to keep in mind that portions with low spectral weight may be overlooked . on the other hand",
    "the fact that a peak with appreciable weight crosses from photoemission to inverse photoemission at a certain momentum is independent of whether we call this a ` fermi surface ' in the usual sense , and should be reproduced by any theory which claims to describe the system .",
    "it therefore has to be kept in mind that in the following we are basically studying a ` spectral weight fermi surface ' , i.e. the locus in @xmath96 space where an apparent quasiparticle band with high spectral weight crosses the chemical potential . with these _ caveats _ in mind , figures",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] show the low - energy peak structure of @xmath207 for all allowed momenta of the @xmath209 cluster in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone , and for different hole concentrations . in all of these spectra",
    "there is a pronounced peak , whose position shows a smooth dispersion with momentum . around @xmath111",
    "the peak is above @xmath12 , whereas in the center of the brillouin zone it is below .",
    "the locus in @xmath56-space where the peak crosses @xmath12 forms a closed curve around @xmath111 and it is obvious from the figure that the ` hole pocket ' around @xmath111 increases very rapidly with @xmath210 . to estimate the fermi surface volume @xmath211 we assign a weight @xmath212 of @xmath53 to momenta @xmath96 where the peak is below @xmath12 , @xmath213 if the peak is right at @xmath12 and @xmath214 if the peak is above @xmath12 .",
    "our assignments of these weights are given in figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "the fractional fermi surface volume then is @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the number of momenta in the @xmath209 cluster .",
    "of course , the assignment of the @xmath212 involves a certain degree of arbitrariness .",
    "it can be seen from figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] , however , that our @xmath212 would in any way tend to underestimate the fermi surface volume , so that the obtained @xmath211 data points rather have the character of a lower bound to the true @xmath211 .",
    "even if we take into account some small variations of @xmath211 due to different assignments of the weight factors , however , the resulting @xmath211 versus @xmath210 curve never can be made consistent with the luttinger volume , see figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "the deviation from the luttinger volume is quite pronounced at low doping .",
    "@xmath211 approaches the luttinger volume for dopings @xmath217% , but due to our somewhat crude way of determining @xmath211 we can not really decide when precisely the luttinger theorem is obeyed .",
    "the hubbard i approximation approaches the luttinger volume for hole concentrations of @xmath218% , i.e. the steepness of the drop of @xmath211 is not reproduced quantitatively .",
    "the latter is somewhat improved in the so - called @xmath117-pole approximation@xcite .",
    "for example the fermi surface given by beenen and edwards@xcite for @xmath219 obviously is very consistent with the spectrum in figure [ fig11 ] for @xmath220 .",

    "the different features that are seen at @xmath15 are still rather clearly visible , but for @xmath222 the low energy quasiparticle band at @xmath223 starts to disappear , and at @xmath224 the dominant ` band ' in the spectrum between @xmath225 and @xmath226 can be fitted by a sligtly renormalized free - electron band . as we have seen above",

    "+ next , the four plots of figure [ fig13 ] show the spectra at selected @xmath56-points .",
    "the system size is only @xmath229 in this case because this allows for smaller error bars .",
    "closer inspection , especially , of the peaks at momentum @xmath89 on the photoemission side ( plot ( a ) ) and at momentum @xmath91 on the inverse photoemission side ( plot ( d ) ) confirms , that with increasing hole concentration we are losing parts of the 4-band structure seen at half - filling .",
    "+ to check the physics of the band structur in more detail , we again employ our diagnostic operators .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows the angle - resolved spectral functions @xmath199 of the spin-@xmath19 and spin-@xmath92 string operators , @xmath187 and @xmath200 .",
    "as was the case at half - filling , the spectrum of the spin-@xmath19 string operator highlights exactly those peaks that we associate with the dipsersionless ` dressed hole ' bands in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the spectrum of the spin-@xmath92 string operator on the other hand has its peaks with maximal spectral weight around momentum @xmath91 , indicating that also in the doped case there is an ` antiferromagnetic mirror image ' of the quasiparticle band ( which , however , consists of spin-@xmath92 states ) .",
    "again , coupling of photoholes to thermally excited spin excitations may make these states visible in arpes spectra , thus explaining the ` shadow bands ' seen in photoemission experiments by aebi _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "similarly as for half - filling one might speculate that a magnetic field , which would break spin symmetry and thus allow for a coupling of ` bands ' with different total spin , would enhance the spectral weight of these shadow bands .",
    "+ all in all we have ssen that the ` band structure ' ( @xmath228-band structure , dispersion of regions of large spectral weight , ` character ' of the bands as measured by the diagnostic operators ) stays pretty much unchanged as long as we are in the underdoped regime . at half - filling the @xmath228-band structure",
    "is closely related to the sharp low - energy mode in the dynamical spin correlation function , which naturally suggests to study the spin reponse also as a function of doping .",
    "figure [ fig15 ] shows the spin - correlation function , @xmath230 ( left column ) , and the charge - correlation function , @xmath119 ( right column ) , for @xmath102 and densities @xmath221 ( underdoped ) , @xmath231 ( nearly optimally doped ) and @xmath224 ( overdoped ) .",

    "on the other hand , as soon as the system enters the overdoped regime the spin - response is no longer sharply peaked at momentum @xmath91 and energy @xmath232 : it broadens in momentum and spreads in energy by an order of magnitude with the scale changing from @xmath16 to @xmath234 accompanied by a similar change in the bandwidth of the single particle excitations .",

    "in the present work we have systemactically studied the temperature- and doping - dependent dynamics of the two - dimensional hubbard model by finite - temperature qmc simulations . comparing the qmc single particle spectral function , the dynamical spin response and the spectral functions of suitably chosen diagnostic operators , different physical regimes could be identified . in simplest terms",
    "there are two quantities , which basically determine the single particle spectrum : the hole concentration and the the spin - response function , whereby there is a certain relationship between the two .",
    "+ at half - filling and high temeratures ( @xmath253 ) , the combined photoemission and and inverse photoemission spectrum @xmath93 displays two dispersive features , the upper and lower hubbard band , roughly separated by @xmath13 ( @xmath254 , in our work ) . at these very high temperatures",
    "the system is in a spin disordered state .",
    "we have demonstrated here that the well - known hubbard - i approximation gives an excellent description of the single particle spectrum in this state , reproducing quantitatively both the single - particle dispersion and the distribution of spectral weight .",
    "this is by no means trivial , since the hubbard - i approximation is dynamically equivalent to a simplified effective hamiltonian , which just contains hole - like ( @xmath255 ) and double occupancy - like particles in a simple bi - quadratic form .",
    "+ at lower temperatures ( @xmath256 ) , the hubbard - i approximation needs to be improved ; this is to be expected , because it neglects all effects of spin - correlations .",
    "in fact , the temperature where deviations from hubbard - i become strong , coincides fairly well with the transition from a spin response @xmath118 which is diffuse both in momentum and energy ( with a spread of order @xmath8 ) , to a more ` spin - wave - like ' response . in this regime @xmath118",

    "they have often been interpreted as four ` bands ' , two ` coherent ' bands forming the topmost valence and the lowest conduction band in the insulator plus two ` incoherent ' bands , i.e. the remaining upper and lower hubbard band features ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our present work not only definitively identifies these four bands but also clarifies their physical origin and their connection to the spin - excitations . in simplest terms",
    "the emerging spin waves at lower temperatures provide the excitations that can ` dress ' the hubbard quasiparticles , whence new bands corresponding to dressed holes / double occupancies appear in the single particle spectrum @xmath93 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath228-band structure which appears in @xmath93 at lower temperatures can be explained in this way , and our present numerical check by directly calculating the spectra of ` dressed electrons ' supports this interpretation .",
    "+ this physical picture at half - filling can be extended into the underdoped regime .",
    "this is most obvious in the single particle spectral function , which stays almost unchanged in the doped case ( i.e. the @xmath228-band structure and the ` character ' of the bands as measured by the diagnostic operators ) .",
    "the main change in fact consists in the chemical potential cutting gradually into the ( top of the ) lower hubbard band , precisely as predicted by the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "contrary to widespread belief the ` fermi surface ' , if determined by the fermi surface crossings of the dominant band through the chemical potential , does not satisfy the luttinger theorem .",
    "rather , for small hole concentrations the fermi surface volume is considerable larger than that for a slightly less than half - filled free - electron band .",
    "very similar conclusions have in fact been reached by a calculation of the electron momentum distribution in the 2d t - j model by puttika _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "their calculation actually was a high temperature series expansion plus a pad extrapolation to lower temperature , and it is encouraging that this method gives similar results as our qmc results which are performed at relatively high temperatures . in its range of applicability ,",
    "i.e. in the absence of strong magnetic correlations and close to half - filling , the hubbard - i approximation thus works remarkably well , both at half - filling and in the doped case .",
    "we stress that this has profound implications for the theoretical treatment of the model : perturbation expansions in @xmath13 or partial and self - consistent resummations thereof , may not be expected to give any meaningful results in this strong - coupling / low doping regime .",
    "+ an interesting question is the possibility to verify our results experimentally .",
    "as already mentioned above , a scan of the temperature development of @xmath207 shows that the part of the quasiparticle band near @xmath111 ( where the fermi surface is located ) is loosing weight with decreasing temperature .",
    "in fact in arpes experiments on underdoped cuprate superconductors the ` hole - pocket ' around @xmath111 seen in our simulations ( and the expansion of puttika _ et al . _ ) is not observed , but rather a small ` fermi arc ' near @xmath195 , terminated by the ` pseudo gap ' around @xmath196 although our simulations do not allow to make statements about the truely low temperatures in the experiments , we believe that this suggests a strong temperature dependence of the single particle spectrum , with the temperature scale being set by the exchange constant @xmath121 ( which controls the degree of spin disorder ) .",
    "the latter is rather large in copper oxides , so that the temperature regime studied in our simulations probably can not be accessed experimentally in these materials .",
    "we note , however , that an arpes study for the 1d material @xmath260 which has a smaller exchange constant , has indeed provided evidence for a strong @xmath242-dependence of @xmath207@xcite .",
    "clearly , it would be interesting to study the fermi surface evolution in a 2d material with lower exchange constant .",
    "+ as was the case at half - filling , the dynamical spin - response plays an important role : throughout the hubbard - i phase at low doping , the spin response shows the sharp low - energy mode at @xmath111 .",
    "the simultaneous disappearance of the @xmath228-band structure in @xmath207 and the low energy spin response with scale @xmath121 in the overdoped regime then show again the close relationship between the two .",
    "the dressing of holes by spin excitations apparently remains the most important correction over hubbard - i . in the overdoped regime the spin response is spread out over an energy range of @xmath261 and thus becomes more similar to the charge response .",
    "the single - particle spectral function is most consistent with a slightly renormalized free electron dispersion , and the luttinger theorem appears to be satisfied even at the relatively high temperature @xmath206 .",
    "this is quite consistent with earlier results on the t - j model , which show that for hole concentrations @xmath262 % the spin and charge response can be approximated well by the self - convolution of the single particle spectral function@xcite .",
    "this is essentially what is to be expected for a system of weakly interacting fermions , so that we conclude that in the overdoped regime we enter a new phase which most probably extends to the low - concentration limit where the nagaoka @xmath242-matrix approximation becomes exact .",
    "finally we note that exact diagonalization studies at finite temperatures@xcite also show some evidence for a ` crossover ' between different physical regimes at a hole concentration of @xmath263% . +",

    "<S> we present results of a systematic quantum - monte - carlo study for the single - band hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> thereby we evaluated single - particle spectra ( pes & ipes ) , two - particle spectra ( spin & density correlation functions ) , and the dynamical correlation function of suitably defined diagnostic operators , all as a function of temperature and hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> the results allow to identify different physical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> near half - filling we find an anomalous ` hubbard - i phase ' , where the band structure is , up to some minor modifications , consistent with the hubbard - i predictions . at lower temperatures , where the spin response becomes sharp , additional dispersionless ` bands ' emerge due to the dressing of electrons / holes with spin excitatons . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple phenomenological fit which reproduces the band structure of the insulator quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface volume in the low doping phase , as derived from the single - particle spectral function , is not consistent with the luttinger theorem , but qualitatively in agreement with the predictions of the hubbard - i approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous phase extends up to a hole concentration of @xmath0% , i.e. the underdoped region in the phase diagram of high - t@xmath1 superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the nature of the magnetic ordering transition in the single particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the transition to an sdw - like band structure is not accomplished by the formation of any resolvable ` precursor bands ' , but rather by a ( spectroscopically invisible ) band of spin 3/2 quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications for the ` remnant fermi surface ' in insulating cuprate compounds and the shadow bands in the doped materials .    2 </S>"
