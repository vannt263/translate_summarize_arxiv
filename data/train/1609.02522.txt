    "berry phase @xcite of a quantum system is an important physical effect that has been discussed in depth @xcite . because berry phase , as a quantum phase in the wave function , depends only on the geometric path of the system , it is called geometric phase .",
    "the phenomena of geometric phase also exist in classical systems @xcite , for example , in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "to avoid confusion , berry phase is used only for the quantum phase in the wave function in this paper .    in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "charged particles gyrate in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , exerting helical orbits .",
    "this gyro - motion of a charged particle can be characterized by a dynamic gyro - phase around the magnetic field . in a strongly magnetized plasma ,",
    "the fast gyro - motion of charged particles leads to the temporal and spatial scale separation , and is usually averaged out in the magneto - hydrodynamic and traditional gyro - kinetic theories .",
    "however , the gyro - phase itself still carries important information and plays an important role in modern gyro - kinetic theories @xcite .",
    "recently , liu and qin @xcite discussed the gyro - motion of a charged particle in a spatially uniform , time - dependent magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was found that when the magnetic field returns to its original direction , apart from the phase advance produced by the gyro - motion , there is an additional geometric phase in the gyro - phase , which equals to the solid angle @xmath0 spanned by the trace of the magnetic field unit vector @xmath1 on the unit sphere @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the berry phase associated with an electron spin eigenstate under the same change of the magnetic field is @xmath3 @xcite , whose sign depends on the spin direction .",
    "ref.@xcite discussed the similarities and differences between the geometric phase in a charged particle s gyro - motion and the berry phase for the electron spin in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , no direct connection was found in their paper . even though the gyro - motion is not the classical counterpart of the quantum spin",
    ", the similarities in these two geometric phases may still imply certain connections in a deeper level    in this paper , we show that the classical geometric phase of the gyro - motion is produced by the berry phase of the underlying quantum system .",
    "however , it is the berry phases of the orbital angular momentum eigenstates on the landau levels @xcite , instead of those of the spin eigenstates .",
    "the berry phase is governed by the schrdinger equation , while the geometric phase of the gyro - motion is governed by newton s equation .",
    "the direct connection between the two reveals the identical physical and geometric nature for the two geometric phases .",
    "the connection is establish through three steps .",
    "first , we recall the fact that the gyro - motion of a classical charged particle can be described by a quantum coherent state .",
    "then we calculate the berry phase for each component that makes up the coherent state .",
    "lastly , we prove that the interference of these components after gaining their berry phases results in a naturally defined coherent berry phase for the coherent state , which is exactly the classical geometric phase of the gyro - motion . to further clarify the relationship between the geometric phase of the gyro - motion and the berry phase of a charged particle with spin , we will also analyze elections with spin governed by the dirac equation and",
    "show that the berry phase of an eigenstate in the non - relativistic limit consists of two parts , the orbital part and the spin part .",
    "the orbital berry phases of the eigenstates interfere coherently to produce a coherent berry phase corresponding to the classical geometric phase of gyro - motion , while the spin berry phases have no classical counterparts , as expected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the geometric phase of a charged particle s gyro - motion .",
    "we review in sec.iii the derivation of the landau levels and construct coherent states for a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the berry phase associated with a coherent state is calculated and the connection to the geometric phase of the gyro - motion is established in sec.iv . in sec.v , we calculate the berry phases of an electron described by the dirac equation and analyze the berry phases due to orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in this section , we review the derivation @xcite of the classical geometric phase of the gyro - motion for a classical charged particle in a time - dependent magnetic field . consider a classical charged particle with charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 in a spatially - uniform but time - dependent magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "newton s equation for the particle is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gyro - frequency . to define the gyro - phase",

    "the energy eigenstates are infinitely degenerate in each of the energy levels which are known as landau levels @xcite . from these eigenstates , we can construct a coherent state which is a non - diffusive wave packet gyrating around the magnetic field and corresponds to a classical charged particle .",
