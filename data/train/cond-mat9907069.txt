    "nature offers many examples of systems driven by some external force towards an out of equilibrium state characterized by critical spatiotemporal correlations@xcite . in this stationary state the accumulated stress is dissipated by avalanches of activity which occur intermittently and cover all space and time scales",
    ". models of nonequilibrium critical dynamics displaying such features have been proposed for several phenomena , ranging from earthquakes@xcite to interface depinning@xcite , or biological evolution in ecosystems@xcite .",
    "some models of this self  organized criticality ( soc ) are characterized by extremal dynamics . among these , the model of biological evolution introduced by bak and sneppen ( bs ) constitutes an important example @xcite . especially for system with extremal dynamics ,",
    "very few exact results are available so far@xcite .",
    "most of our insight is based on numerical simulations , scaling arguments @xcite , or mean field solutions@xcite , related in general to random neighbor versions of the models .    among the existing mean field approaches ,",
    "a particularly rich and complete one , proposed recently , allows to describe in terms of an inhomogeneous branching process ( bp ) several properties of avalanches , including some due to border effects@xcite . in view of its phenomenological character , an open interesting problem within such an approach remains the identification of specific microscopic models realizing the scalings of the inhomogeneous bp in some appropriate random neighbor , or similar limit@xcite .",
    "a step towards the establishment of an analytical theory of scaling in extremal dynamics systems was made recently by boettcher and paczuski@xcite , who computed exactly a correlation function of an @xmath1component version of the bs evolution model in the limit when @xmath1 approaches infinity .",
    "this result , combined with numerical ones , allowed verification of important general scaling laws for self organized critical behavior@xcite .",
    "such laws describe the connection between space and time fractal properties of avalanches in the bulk .    for models like sandpiles ,",
    "soc can be established thanks to effects of the boundary dissipation , which balanches the flux of added particles@xcite .",
    "this basic circumstance , together with experience with standard criticality , called recently attention on the boundary scaling properties of avalanches @xcite .",
    "surface scaling in sandpiles can be different from the bulk one and can also depend on the type of boundary conditions ( b.c . ) considered . in those models",
    "the obvious alternative to dissipative b.c .",
    "are conditions in which part of the border does not dissipate grains@xcite . for evolution models , which do not dissipate particles ,",
    "it is not known whether boundary conditions could influence scaling at the border and , in case , what should correspond to conservation .",
    "these are issues we address in the present article .    especially in the perspective of obtaining exact results ,",
    "the study of boundary scaling should represent an important step towards a deeper and more complete theoretical understanding of soc . in the present article",
    "we show that the @xmath7 model of ref.@xcite , if considered in the presence of boundaries , provides a microscopic realization of the inhomogeneous bp introduced in @xcite .",
    "besides generalizing immediately to this model results known for bp , this opens new possibilities of both analytical and numerical investigation .",
    "in particular , by extending methods used previously for the bulk@xcite , we are able to compute exactly the asymptotic two  point correlator when it involves a point on the boundary in the @xmath7 limit .",
    "these results , and an accurate numerical analysis of time correlations at the boundary , allow to draw a complete scenario of the scalings obeyed by boundary and bulk exponents of the system .",
    "boundary avalanches have different scaling properties for different boundary conditions .",
    "however , even in the case of dissipative border , in which exponents differ from those in the bulk , space and time fractal dimensions of the avalanches remain unaltered and satisfy the same basic scaling relations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after introducing the semi  infinite @xmath1component model , we discuss its relation with inhomogeneous bp in the @xmath2 limit and derive a number of analytical and numerical results for size and spatial distribution properties .",
    "the third section is devoted to a discussion of exponents related to the time recurrence of activity at the border .",
    "the last section contains general conclusions .",
    "the possible relevance of the bs model for evolution , as revealed , e.g. , by paleonthological records@xcite , has been already discussed in the literature . here",
    "we regard this model and its variants as an interesting mathematical framework within which soc dynamics can be studied .",
    "we consider an open chain of species , labelled by an index @xmath8 .",
    "each species is characterized by @xmath1 independent parameters ( traits ) @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , which somehow quantify the ability of the species to survive in connection with @xmath1 different tasks it has to perform in the eco  system .",
    "the closer @xmath9 to @xmath12 , the more the ability connected to the @xmath13th task , and thus the higher the chance that the species avoids mutation .",
    "the dynamics goes as follows . at every time",
    "step the smallest @xmath9 , i.e. the weakest among the traits of all species , is identified and replaced by @xmath12 .",
    "each one of the species which are neighbors along the chain of that , @xmath14 , with minimum @xmath15 , get replaced one of their traits ( chosen at random among the @xmath1 possible ones ) with new random numbers extracted independently and with uniform probability in the interval @xmath16 . a new minimum is then searched and this proceeds so that on long times the system self  organizes itself in a stationary state with all @xmath9 uniformly distributed in an interval @xmath17 .    a @xmath18avalanche is identified with a sequence of mutations starting at site @xmath14 with @xmath19 , and continuing until the current minimum @xmath15 remains below @xmath18 .",
    "we call @xmath20 ( duration of the avalanche ) the total number of minima with value below @xmath18 obtained during the avalanche .",
    "rather then considering a translation invariant situation as in ref.@xcite , we think here to a semi  infinite chain , with suitable b.c .. the probability that in the stationary state a @xmath18avalanche has size @xmath20 , will thus depend on the site @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the avalanche started . omitting to explicitate the @xmath18dependence , we indicate such probability by @xmath23 .",
    "the above dynamical rules , for @xmath24 , lead to write @xmath25 +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lambda^2 \\sum_{s^\\prime = 0}^s p_{j+1}(s^\\prime ) p_{j-1 } ( s - s^\\prime ) % \\vspace j>1 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ,   j > 1 \\label{prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([prob ] ) is derived on the basis of the same considerations made in ref.@xcite . in first place eq.([prob ] ) reflects the fact that , with our dynamical rules , the starting active site ( site @xmath21 for which @xmath26 absolute minimum ) can activate one of its neighbors with probability @xmath27 , or both with probability @xmath28 . in the two cases , of course , one or two indipendent avalanches follow , respectively , and the global avalanche grows up to a total of @xmath29 activated sites .",
    "the above independence , which allows to write eq.([prob ] ) in such form , holds in the @xmath30 limit , which is implicitly assumed here .",
    "indeed , only with @xmath31 the evolution of an avalanche is completely unaffected by the fact that a given site has been previously involved in the same , or another , avalanche .",
    "the effects of this kind of conditions can indeed be seen to amount to corrections of the order @xmath32 , or higher , in the equations of motion .",
    "eq.([prob ] ) needs of course to be complemented with b.c .. these conditions can be written in different ways .",
    "a first possibility is : @xmath33 this means that , once the boundary site @xmath12 becomes active , it can then activate only site @xmath34 ( site 0 does not exist ) , and this occurs with the usual modalities .",
    "an alternative boundary condition is : @xmath35 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lambda^2 \\sum_{s^\\prime = 0}^s p_1(s^\\prime ) p_2 ( s - s^\\prime ) \\label{bound2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([bound2 ] ) means that for the boundary site , when active , the rule of setting @xmath36 , valid for @xmath37 , does not apply . on the contrary , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "get now the random replacement of one of their traits , as sites @xmath40 , and @xmath41 in the bulk ( see eq.([prob ] ) ) . in other words ,",
    "the role of the missing site @xmath42 is now played by the site @xmath38 itself .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize that , up to minor modifications due to the convention assumed here of replacing by @xmath12 the @xmath43 associated to the minimum trait , eqs.([prob ] ) and ( [ bound1 ] ) have the same structure as those describing the inhomogeneous bp in @xmath0 of ref.@xcite . by introducing generating functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,",
    "it was found there that @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , when @xmath48 .",
    "this value of @xmath18 is such to imply an average number @xmath49 of sites activated by each active site in the bulk and coincides with @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the average number of sites activated by the border site @xmath12 is instead less than unity , according to eq.([bound1 ] ) .",
    "all this means that , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with @xmath3 , when @xmath53 .",
    "this has to be compared with the result @xmath54@xcite holding when the site where the avalanche starts is chosen in the bulk , and implying a mean field bulk exponent @xmath55@xcite .",
    "we indicate by @xmath56 the probability that , at @xmath51 , an avalanche started at site @xmath21 never reaches site @xmath57 .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of @xmath58 for @xmath38 and large @xmath59 , which is in turn related to the asymptotic radial distribution of avalanches starting at the border of the chain .",
    "the markovian nature of avalanche evolution allows to write @xmath60 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{4}n(j+1,r)n(j-1,r ) , \\label{n1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath61 .",
    "the b.c . in eq.([bound1 ] ) imply @xmath62 while , since obviously @xmath63 , @xmath64 let us put now @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 represents the probability that an avalanche starting in site @xmath21 reaches site @xmath59 . from the above equations follows :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the discrete laplacian of @xmath66 at site @xmath69 .",
    "since we are interested in the large @xmath59 behavior , we can pass to a continuum limit , introducing the variable @xmath70 . by putting @xmath71",
    ", we obtain from eq.([n4 ] ) @xmath72 with boundary conditions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "( [ n5 ] ) can be integrated and , after some algebra , one finds : @xmath75 ^ 3   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{2}{9 } \\frac{1}{r^3}\\left[\\frac{\\gamma(1/3)\\gamma(1/6 ) } { \\gamma(1/2)}\\right]^3 \\simeq \\frac{20.14 ..",
    "}{r^3}. \\label{n6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the probability that a critical avalanche starting at site @xmath12 reaches site @xmath59 is @xmath76 , we conclude @xmath77 , from the fact that @xmath78 .",
    "the above derivation extends the approach of ref.@xcite , which yielded @xmath79 for the bulk @xmath80 .",
    "the presence of a border like that specified by the b.c . in eq.(2 ) , should be expected to make the avalanche propagation more difficult compared to the bulk situation .",
    "thus , the result @xmath81 is physically sound compared to @xmath82 . the fact that the radial probability distribution function decays with a different exponent when the starting point is at the border with b.c .",
    "( [ bound1 ] ) , is qualitatively consistent with what we know of the two  point correlator at an equilibrium critical point when one of the points is fixed at the boundary and not in the bulk@xcite .",
    "the exact results above for @xmath83 and @xmath84 allow to draw a first conclusion on the space fractal dimension , @xmath85 , of avalanches starting at a border with b.c .",
    "assuming @xmath86 for such an avalanche , leads to @xmath87 , which follows from @xmath88 .",
    "thus , @xmath3 and @xmath77 imply @xmath89 .",
    "this dimension coincides with the bulk one , @xmath90 , which satisfies the same kind of relation @xmath91@xcite .",
    "so , at the boundary , there is no distinct space fractal dimension for these avalanches , in spite of the different @xmath92-exponent .",
    "we verified numerically the above result for @xmath83 , by simulating the model on open finite chains of length @xmath93 , with @xmath94 components .",
    "1 reports our finite size data referring to avalanches starting at the border with b.c . given by eq.(2 ) .",
    "the distribution is well compatible with the expected @xmath3 ( we estimated @xmath95 ) .",
    "direct simulation allows us also to investigate the implications of b.c .",
    "( 3 ) , which , as far as @xmath83 is concerned , escape analytical control . for these b.c . , which keep equal to @xmath12 the avarage number of sites activated by the border one , we find numerically @xmath96 , compatible with @xmath97 ( fig.1 ) . since the result @xmath3 should hold for the inhomogeneous bp as long as @xmath98@xcite , we conclude that @xmath97 is peculiar of b.c .",
    "consistently one can also show that , with b.c .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath99 exactly . thus , also @xmath100 is restored to its bulk value by b.c . ( 3 ) . in the soc context",
    ", similar results were previously conjectured , on numerical basis , for the abelian sandpile in two dimensions@xcite . indeed , for that model border avalanches appeared to possess a toppling distribution exponent rather close to the bulk value for conservative border , while with boundary dissipation a different @xmath83 applied@xcite .",
    "border dissipativity in a bs evolution model should then be associated to the fact that the average number of sites activated by the extremal site is less than the critical bulk value .",
    "2 illustrates a numerical determination of @xmath101 for avalanches starting with dissipative b.c .",
    "we obtain @xmath102 well consistent with our exact result . with b.c .",
    "( 3 ) we get @xmath103 , compatible in this case with the exact @xmath99 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "avalanches of a bs model posses also time fractal properties , revealed , e.g. , by the distribution of first return times of the activity in a given site ( time being measured by the number of minima which get replaced during the avalanche ) . some general relations among exponents connected with time and space fractal behavior in the bulk@xcite can be easily derived by arguing as follows .",
    "if we define as @xmath104 the probability distribution of first return times in a given site , and call @xmath105 the total number of returns in a lapse of time @xmath106 , we expect @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a time fractal dimension , and @xmath109 upon putting @xmath110 , we get @xmath111 .",
    "let us then call @xmath112 the distribution of times for all subsequent returns in a given site .",
    "we clearly have @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at this point ,",
    "to link space and time fractal properties is sufficient to consider an avalanche as made of a total of @xmath20 activated sites within a @xmath116dimensional hyperspherical region of radius @xmath59 such that @xmath117 .",
    "if the avalanche has time duration @xmath118 , we must have @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is an exponent connecting space and time ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the last relation treats all lattice sites within the sphere as equivalent , as far as the return of activity is concerned .",
    "now , since in our model @xmath122 by definition , @xmath123 also applies . eventually , one finds : @xmath124 this relation was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for bulk exponents .",
    "the present derivation at first sight looks applicable also to avalanches starting at the border .",
    "the @xmath125 , @xmath7 bs model is an ideal context in which to test its validity . in ref.@xcite a numerical estimate of @xmath126",
    "was obtained which turned out to be well compatible with the value implied by relation ( 11 ) ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we made a similar determination of @xmath6 for avalanches starting at both dissipative and nondissipative borders .",
    "the data are plotted in fig.3 , where one can clearly appreciate that the same values of @xmath6 apply in the two cases . indeed , for conservative b.c .",
    "( 3 ) ) we estimate @xmath128 . with dissipative b.c .",
    "there appears to be a longer transient before the asymptotic time scaling behavior establishes .",
    "however , we estimated @xmath129 , clearly compatible again with @xmath130 . in both cases ,",
    "of course , the bulk avalanches have a distribution with @xmath131 .",
    "our results indicate that , like the space fractal dimension @xmath85 , also the time fractal dimension @xmath132 of boundary avalanches is the same as its bulk counterpart , with all b.c . , and eq .",
    "( 11 ) is always satisfied .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a simulation of the @xmath125 , @xmath133 bs model yielded a @xmath134 sensibly different from @xmath126 .",
    "if such a discrepancy would be confirmed by more systematic and asymptotic determinations , one should suspect that the identity of @xmath85 and @xmath90 , or even the validity of some scaling relations like eq.(11 ) , are somehow granted here by the peculiar , classical character of the @xmath7 model .",
    "anyhow , in such a case , a more complex scaling scenario would certainly apply to the model of ref .",
    "the @xmath1component bs model in the limit @xmath135 is an interesting theoretical laboratory for testing properties of the soc state . with the present work we were able to compute analytically in @xmath125 the exponents @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath100 referring , respectively , to size distribution and space correlation of avalanches starting at a border specified by b.c .",
    "this extends previous results in ref.@xcite , which referred exclusively to bulk properties .",
    "in addition our formulation allowed to establish a direct link between this model and the inhomogeneous branching process discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results @xmath3 and @xmath81 show that the space fractal dimension @xmath85 of border avalanches with b.c .",
    "( 2 ) remains equal to the bulk one ( @xmath136 ) , in spite of the change of these exponents . complemented with numerical tests",
    ", these results showed the existence of a clear  cut distinction between the b.c . in eq .",
    "( 2 ) and those expressed by eq . ( 3 ) . in analogy with the physics of sandpile models ,",
    "we were led to call b.c .",
    "( 2 ) dissipative , due to the fact that , in force of them , the boundary site , on average , is able to transmit activity to less than one site , even if the bulk is critical .",
    "this dissipativity is responsible for boundary values of the exponents @xmath83 and @xmath100 different from the bulk ones . on the other hand ,",
    "are conservative in the sense speciefied by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the existence of a geometrical boundary does not seem enough to determine a scaling different from the bulk one .    to border dissipation , which for models like sandpiles is a necessary condition for the very establishment of the stationary soc state ,",
    "could be given here a precise meaning also in the context of a model with extremal dynamics .",
    "in this model dissipation reveals an essential ingredient for the existence of peculiar boundary scaling , distinct from the bulk one .",
    "indications that this could be a general feature of the soc state come also from previous numerical results for sandpiles @xcite .",
    "our study of the return of activity at the border site revealed that dissipativity does not determine a new boundary @xmath6 exponent , consistent with eq .",
    "( 11 ) and with the fact that , like @xmath85 , for boundary avalanches also @xmath132 remains unaltered with respect to its bulk value .",
