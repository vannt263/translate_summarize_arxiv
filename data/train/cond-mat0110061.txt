    "although the interest in disordered spin systems reaches back several decades ( for a review , see e.g. ref . )",
    ", interest has strongly revived in recent years by the recognition that high-@xmath0 compounds exhibit phases with antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , spin - glass order or stripe order in certain ranges of temperature and doping .",
    "a prominent example for such materials is la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , in which every cu atom carries a spin @xmath5 ( for an overview on this material , see e.g. ref . ) .    in these materials ,",
    "the spins are located in weakly coupled layers . within each layer ,",
    "the spins constitute a square lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between nearest neighbors.@xcite in the undoped system , these spins can be represented to a good approximation by a classical two - dimensional model since quantum fluctuations lead to a merely quantitative renormalization of the classical parameters.@xcite although a weak coupling between the layers and a weak easy - plane anisotropy are present in these materials ( both are about five orders of magnitude smaller than the isotropic intra - plane exchange@xcite ) , they become relevant only on relatively large scales .",
    "thus , on the finite length scales of experimental relevance , the spins can be described in a first approximation by a classical heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions .",
    "doping induces holes in the layers , which can lead to quenched frustration of the exchange couplings .",
    "frustration can occur when the holes are localized individually@xcite as well as when they condense into a topologically defective array of stripes which act as antiphase domain walls for the afm order.@xcite both cases can be represented by an effective bond - disordered heisenberg model .",
    "such a system is expected to display generic spin - glass behavior , as is observed in experiments beyond a critical doping.@xcite    on the theoretical side , heisenberg spin glasses are much less understood than ising spin glasses .",
    "while it is well established for the pure two - dimensional system that the magnetic correlation length @xmath6 decays exponentially with increasing temperature,@xcite the dependence of @xmath6 on disorder is controversial .",
    "at @xmath7 it is not clear whether @xmath6 is finite for every small but finite concentration of defect bonds@xcite or whether @xmath6 is infinite up to a critical concentration even for strong defects.@xcite concerning the temperature dependence of @xmath6 , there is no consensus as to whether it is reentrant@xcite or not.@xcite to readdress these unsettled issues , we develop a theoretical approach for bond disordered spin glasses which complements previous approaches . in particular , we calculate the correlation length and compare our results to the results of previous theoretical approaches and to experiments on high-@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.model ] we establish the model and briefly review the mechanism by which holes generate magnetic textures that provide the nucleus for a reduction of magnetic order . based on this mechanism ,",
    "we further motivate why it is desirable to develop an alternative to previous theoretical approaches . in sec .",
    "[ sec.th ] , we derive the functional renormalization group equations .",
    "these flow equations are evaluated numerically and our results for the magnetic correlation length are compared to experimental data in sec .",
    "[ sec.res ] , where we also consider the dimensional crossover from 2d to 3d behavior .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec.concl ] .",
    "in a system with sparse substitutional doping , the dopants can be considered as randomly distributed with negligible correlations and as quenched over a wide temperature range . in doped mott insulators ,",
    "the effect of the dopants is twofold : they induce holes in the cuprate planes and at the same time they provide a random potential that localizes these holes .",
    "therefore , they are commonly assumed to be localized on the oxygen atoms between neighboring copper atoms.@xcite    a simple argument suggests that such a hole transmutes the antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling between the neighboring copper spins into a ferromagnetic one .",
    "thereby frustration is induced in the spin system.@xcite the irrelevance of quantum fluctuations of the spins in the pure system@xcite ( in the sense that they lead only to a quantitative renormalization of classical parameters such as the spin stiffness ) suggests that they may be neglected in a good approximation also for small doping.@xcite      starting from a classical description of the afm , we may examine an equivalent model where all spins of one bipartite sublattice are flipped and the sign of all exchange couplings is reversed,@xcite i.e. , we now consider the coupling of the undoped system to be ferromagnetic and the defect couplings to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "we base our analysis on the hamiltonian @xmath8 ^ 2   \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for spins on a ( hyper)cubic lattice in @xmath9 dimensions ( a single layer is described by @xmath10 ) .",
    "spins are treated as classical @xmath11-component vectors of unit length , @xmath12 .",
    "a spin at site @xmath13 is coupled to its nearest neighbor in direction @xmath14 via the exchange coupling @xmath15 .",
    "we define @xmath16 for a basis vector @xmath17 .",
    "the global symmetry @xmath18 of spin rotations is preserved for arbitrarily disordered exchange couplings .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the exchange coupling as @xmath19 j \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the value @xmath20 of the pure system and the quenched random variable @xmath21 .",
    "frustration effects emerge for @xmath22 , when a ferromagnetic bond becomes antiferromagnetic . to further specify the nature of disorder ,",
    "we assume a bimodal distribution of the exchange couplings , @xmath23 for square lattices as in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , the concentration @xmath24 is related to this probability by @xmath25 .",
    "correlations between different bonds are assumed to be absent .",
    "before we address the magnetic order in the presence of a finite concentration of defects , it is instructive to recall briefly the physics of a _ single _ defect for @xmath26 . while the ground state of the pure system is collinear ( all spins are strictly parallel ) , it is canted ( i.e. , no longer collinear ) for a single defect beyond a certain critical strength @xmath27.@xcite the threshold @xmath28 value can be obtained from a spin - wave calculation@xcite ( see also appendix [ app.cont ] ) .",
    "the ground state for a single defect with @xmath29 remains _ planar _ for all @xmath26 , i.e. , apart from a global rotation , the defect texture for heisenberg spins ( @xmath30 ) is identical to the texture for xy spins ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "far away from the defect bond , the texture is described by the solution of the laplace equation@xcite @xmath32 and the spins approach a collinear configuration , @xmath33 for @xmath34 . to be specific ,",
    "we discuss a defect bond located at @xmath35 and oriented in direction @xmath36 .",
    "it acts as a source of a dipolar distortion with a moment @xmath37 perpendicular to @xmath38 . for @xmath10 , in particular ,",
    "@xmath39 the amplitude of the dipole moment is determined by the nonlinearity of the model , which may be considered as interaction between spin waves .",
    "the magnetic textures of several defect bonds are subject to a dipolar interaction at large distances.@xcite the effects of a finite density of defects are nontrivial because of the frustrated long - range interaction between the dipoles . in the presence of more than two defects , the interaction among the dipoles typically becomes frustrated .",
    "then the ground state is no longer planar for @xmath40 .",
    "depending on the relative position of several defect bonds in a cluster , the generated texture may have dipolar or higher - order multipolar structure .",
    "in contrast to electrodynamics , the multipolar moments of defect textures are not additive since the spins act as a nonlinear medium for the dipoles , giving rise to many - body interactions .",
    "in particular , clusters of defects can lead to canting already for defect - bond strengths _ below _",
    "@xmath27 , i.e. , in clusters of defects the threshold strength of the defect bonds is reduced .",
    "the threshold values of some specific bond configurations in the xy model are given in refs . and",
    "in particular table i in the latter one ) . in general ,",
    "threshold values in the xy system are upper bounds for the thresholds in a heisenberg system since with increasing @xmath11 the spins have a larger space of canted states which they may explore to minimize energy .    thus , as soon as the defects are antiferromagnetic ( @xmath41 ) they can induce canted textures due to the presence of arbitrarily large clusters.@xcite hence the ground state will be canted for _ every _ @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( assuming that the defect distribution has no pathological spatial correlations ) .",
    "therefore one may expect a system with a certain density of weak defects @xmath43 to be qualitatively equivalent to a system with a ( possibly much ) smaller concentration of strong defects @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of canting certainly implies a reduction of magnetization .",
    "however , one can not draw direct conclusions about the range of magnetic order . for a sufficiently high density of strong defects ,",
    "one certainly has short - range order . for defects of a weaker strength or a lower concentration",
    ", one can have also quasi - long - range order ( as in a xy model with quenched and uncorrelated dipoles@xcite ) . a phase with",
    "true long - range order is also possible but unlikely since it would require a highly ordered dipole configuration .",
    "it is instructive to recall a `` duality '' relation@xcite in the @xmath45 parameter space , since in a mixture of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds there are two ways to declare one type as `` regular '' bond and the other type as `` defect '' bond ( see appendix [ app.dual ] ) .",
    "this duality implies a relation @xmath46 between boundary lines @xmath47 and @xmath48 limiting regions with ferromagnetic order ( for @xmath49 ) and antiferromagnetic order ( for @xmath50 ) in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "since the duality relation maps the region @xmath51 onto @xmath52 it is sufficient to examine the latter region .    to perform first qualitative estimates ,",
    "one may consider the disorder - averaged exchange coupling , which is @xmath53 for the bimodal distribution ( [ bimodal ] ) .",
    "thus , there is a tendency towards the formation of ferromagnetic order for @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 ) and a tendency towards antiferromagnetic order for @xmath51 ( where @xmath56 ) .",
    "certainly , the presence of order requires more than such a tendency .",
    "a further minimum requirement should be that the relative fluctuations @xmath57 of the exchange couplings must be small .",
    "since @xmath41 and @xmath58 in the range of interest , @xmath59 requires @xmath60 .",
    "a very crude estimate of the boundary from @xmath61 suggests @xmath62    for the special case @xmath63 , the defect bonds have a vanishing exchange coupling and the system is bond - diluted .",
    "the presence of magnetic order ( in the sense of a finite magnetization ) then requires that a finite fraction of spins is connected by regular bonds .",
    "this is the case below the percolation transition , i.e. for @xmath64 in @xmath10.@xcite therefore one expects @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "there are only a few approaches in the literature aiming at a more sophisticated analysis , which we briefly summarize in order to highlight our motivation to reconsider this problem in an alternative way .",
    "first , the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) provides a simple self - consistent approach to determine an effective spin stiffness for the random system . for @xmath31 , the cpa yields@xcite a transition line @xmath67 smoothly interpolating between @xmath68 ( reflecting the canting threshold for individual defect bonds ) and @xmath69 for @xmath70 in @xmath10 and for @xmath71 in @xmath72 . in @xmath10 , the location of the percolation transition is captured exactly",
    "this has to be considered as a fortunate coincidence which is absent in @xmath72 , where the location is found only approximately.@xcite in the limit @xmath73 the cpa yields that the stability of order requires @xmath74,@xcite which results in @xmath75 for small @xmath76 in agreement with the naive estimate ( [ est.fm ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the cpa in somewhat ambiguous.@xcite according to its construction , the cpa replaces the disordered system by a ferromagnetic one with a homogeneous effective exchange constant .",
    "the strength of this effective coupling is determined from a selfconsistency condition that considers the fluctuations of a single bond .",
    "thus , the cpa misses effects of clusters of defect bonds .",
    "the putative transition line is defined as the border line up to which selfconsistent solutions exist . a priori",
    ", this border line can be interpreted in two ways : either as the onset of the canting instability or as the onset of short - range magnetic order .",
    "therefore , the cpa can be only of qualitative use .    to gain insight into the nature of the ground state , gawiec and grempel@xcite ( gg ) performed numerical studies of the xy model in @xmath10 .",
    "their data suggest a transition line @xmath77 between a phase with quasi - long - range order and short - range order .",
    "it starts from at the canting instability @xmath78 and follows @xmath79 beyond the percolation transition .",
    "thus , the data suggest short - range order for an _ arbitrarily small _ concentration of defects of a strength exceeding the canting instability of single defects in agreement with cpa .",
    "however , as stated in ref . , the question of whether one can have order for @xmath44 at sufficiently small @xmath76 remains far from settled due to finite - size effects .    for the heisenberg model with the bimodal bond distribution ,",
    "there are only very few numerical studies . for the special case of two dimensions and @xmath80 , nonomura and ozeki@xcite postulate order for @xmath81 from an exact - diagonalization method for @xmath82 quantum spins .",
    "this implies an even larger stability of the classical model , and in particular @xmath83 .",
    "however , also their conclusion has to considered with care because of finite - size effects .",
    "previous analytic approaches@xcite are implicitly restricted to defect bond strengths exceeding the canting threshold , @xmath84 .",
    "the spin system with random bonds is _ replaced _ by a spin system with homogeneous bonds coupled to an additional canting field that also generates dipolar spin textures . in order to shed some light on the quality of this replacement ,",
