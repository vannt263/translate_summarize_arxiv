    "random number conversion ( rnc ) is a fundamental topic in information theory @xcite , and its asymptotic behavior has been well studied in the context of not only the first - order asymptotics but also the second - order asymptotics @xcite .",
    "the second - order analysis for the random number conversion is remarkable in the following sense .",
    "the second - order coefficients can not be characterized by use of the normal distribution in the case of random number conversion although all of second - order coefficients except for random number conversion are given by use of the normal distribution . to characterize the second - order coefficients in the random number conversion , the previous paper @xcite introduced rayleigh - normal distributions as a new family of distribution .",
    "this new family of distribution leads us to a new frontier of second order analysis , which is completely different from existing analysis of the second coefficients . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a realistic situation , in which one uses this conversion via a storage with a limited size , like a hard disk . in this case , first , initial random numbers are converted to other random numbers in a storage with a limited size , which is called _ random number storage _ or simply storage .",
    "second , the random numbers in the storage are converted to some desired random numbers .",
    "when the size of media for the conversion is limited , it is natural to consider the trade - off between the sizes of target random numbers and the storage .    in this paper , we consider this problem when the initial and the target random random variables are given as multiple copies of respective finite random variables .",
    "that is , the initial random variables are subject to the @xmath0-fold independent and identical distribution ( i.i.d . ) of a distribution @xmath1 with finite support and the target random variables are subject to the @xmath2-fold i.i.d . of another distribution @xmath3 with finite support . in the problem ,",
    "since there is a freedom of the required number of copies of @xmath3 in the target distribution , we have to take care of the trade - off among three factors , the accuracy of the conversion , the size of the storage , and the required number of copies of @xmath3 in the output distribution . for simplicity , we fix the accuracy of the conversion , and investigate the trade - off between the size of the storage and the required number of copies of @xmath3 in the output distribution .",
    "we call this problem rnc via restricted storage . in particular , when @xmath4 , this problem can be regarded as random number compression to the given random number storage .",
    "one of our main purposes is to derive the maximum conversion rate when the rate of storage size is properly limited .",
    "if the size of storage is small , the maximum number of copies of target distribution should also be small since the conversion has to once pass through the small storage .",
    "thus , the allowable size of storage closely relates with the conversion rate of rnc via restricted storage.in this paper , we particularly investigate the region of achievable rate pairs for the size of storage and the number of copies of target distribution in the first- and the second - order settings . to clarify which rate pairs are truly important in the rate region",
    ", we introduce the relations named  better \" and  simulate \" between two rate pairs , and based on these two relations , we define the admissibility of rate pairs .",
    "although admissible rate pairs are only a part of the boundary of the region , those characterize the whole of the rate region , and hence , are of special importance in the rate region .    here , remember that the second coefficients of the random number conversion are characterized by rayleigh - normal distribution @xcite .",
    "since the second - order asymptotic behaviour of other typical information tasks is often described by the standard normal distribution , the characterization by such non - normal distribution is a remarkable feature . to treat the second - order asymptotics of our problem",
    ", we introduce a new kind of probability distribution named generalized rayleigh - normal distribution as an extension of rayleigh - normal distribution .",
    "the generalized rayleigh - normal distributions are a family of probability distributions with two parameters and include the rayleigh - normal in @xcite as the limit case . using the generalized rayleigh - normal distributions",
    ", we can characterize the second - order rate region of rnc with restricted storage in a unified manner    we also consider locc conversion for pure entangled states in quantum information theory .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of locc conversion has been intensively studied @xcite . however , unlike conventional settings of locc conversion , we assume that locc conversion passes through quantum system to store entangled states named _",
    "entanglement storage_. in the setting , an initial i.i.d .",
    "pure entangled state is once transformed into the entanglement storage with smaller dimension by locc and then transformed again to approximate a target i.i.d .",
    "pure state by locc .",
    "in particular , when the target pure entangled state is the same as the original pure entangled state , this problem can be regarded as locc compression of entangled states into the given entanglement storage . since the storage to keep the entangled states",
    "is implemented with a limited resources , the analysis for locc compression is expected to be useful to store entanglement in small quantum system . since locc convertibility between pure entangled states can be translated to majorization relation between two probability distributions consisting of the squared schmidt coefficients of the states @xcite , we focus on the relation between majorization conversion and deterministic conversion which describes rnc to analyze the asymptotic behavior of locc conversion . then , it is shown that the performance of majorization conversion and deterministic conversion asymptotically coincide with each other as similar to the results of conventional rnc shown in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : family ] , we introduce the generalized rayleigh - normal distribution function as a function defined by an optimization problem .",
    "then we show its basic properties used in the asymptotics of rnc via restricted storage . in section [ sec :",
    "narnc ] , we formulate random number conversion ( rnc ) via restricted storage by two kinds of approximate conversion methods and give their relations in non - asymptotic setting . in section [ sec : arnc ] , we proceed to asymptotic analysis for rnc via restricted storage .",
    "then , we show the relation between the rates of the maximum conversion number and storage size and draw various rate regions in both frameworks of first and second - order asymptotic theory . in section [ sec : rcr ] , we see that conventional rnc without storage can be regarded as rnc via restricted storage with infinite size . in section [ sec : aqit ] , we consider locc conversion via entanglement storage for quantum pure states .",
    "using the results for rnc , we derive the asymptotic performance of optimal locc conversion .",
    "in particular , optimal locc compression rate is derived in the second - order asymptotics . in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] , we give technical details of proofs of theorems , propositions and lemmas . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we state the conclusion of the paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new two - parameter probability distribution family on r which contains the rayleigh - normal distribution introduced in @xcite . a function @xmath5 on @xmath6",
    "is generally called a cumulative distribution function if @xmath5 is right continuous , monotonically increasing and satisfies @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then , there uniquely exists a probability distribution on @xmath6 whose cumulative distribution coincides with @xmath5 .",

    "we denote @xmath15 and @xmath16 simply by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    ", it can be easily verified that the generalized rayleigh - normal distribution function has the monotonicity as @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "we further remark that rayleigh - normal distribution function @xmath31 is defined by ( [ eq : rn ] ) with @xmath32 in @xcite , and thus , the following equation holds @xmath33 in this sense , the family of generalized rayleigh - normal distribution function @xmath24 includes rayleigh - normal distribution functions as its limiting case .    to give an explicit form of the rayleigh - normal distribution functions , we prepare three lemmas .    when @xmath34 , the equation with respect to @xmath35 @xmath36 has the unique solution @xmath37 and it satisfies @xmath38    when @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the equation ( [ threshold0 ] ) with respect to @xmath35 has the unique solution @xmath41 .    when @xmath42 , the equation with respect to @xmath35 @xmath43 has the unique solution @xmath44 .",

    "we have considered random number conversion ( rnc ) via random number storage with restricted size . in particular , we derived the rate regions between the storage size and the conversion rate of rnc from the viewpoint of the first- and second - order asymptotics . in the first - order rate region",

    "from the second - order asymptotics , we also obtained asymptotic expansion of maximum generation number with high approximation accuracy .",
    "then , we applied the results for probability distributions to an locc conversion via entanglement storage problem of pure states in quantum information theory . in the problem , we did not assume that an initial state and a target state are the same states , however , the locc conversion via storage can be regarded as compression process if the target state equals the initial state , and thus , our problem setting is a kind of generalization of locc compression for pure states .    here",
    ", we give some special remarks on the admissibility of rate pairs . in the argument to characterization of the rate regions , we defined the simple relations called  better \" and  simulate \" between two rate pairs , and introduced the admissibility of rate pairs based on the relations in order to clarify essentially important rate pairs in the rate region .",
    "the admissible rate pairs can determine whether a rate pair is in the rate region .",
    "that is , for any rate pair in the rate region , there is an admissible rate pair such that the admissible rate pair simulates or is better than the rate pair . on the other hand ,",
    "an arbitrary rate pair not having such an admissible pair is not contained in the rate region .",
    "thus , the admissible rate pairs uniquely determine the whole of rate region although those are a subset of the boundary of the rate region .",
    "moreover , since any admissible rate pair does not simulate or is not better than another admissible one , a proper subset of the admissible rate pairs can not determine the rate region as above . in the sense",
    ", the admissible rate pairs can be regarded as the  minimal generator \" of the rate region , and hence , are of special importance in the rate pairs . to characterize the rate region , the above discussion",
    "tells us the importance of the characterization of the semi - admissible rate pairs . in the first order case",
    ", the characterization can be obtained by the interval between the specific point and the origin . however , in the second order case , it is not so trivial and has been obtained as lemma [ simulate-2nd ] in this paper first time .",
    "the characterization is related to the first order of the specific point as well .",
    "we note that , besides rnc via restricted storage , the notion of `` simulate '' was implicitly appeared in asymmetric information theoretic operations .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "1 in @xcite represents the typical first - order rate region in the wiretap channel then the left side boundary of the region is characterized as an interval between the origin and the other edge point , and hence , the left side boundary is simulated by the edge point of the interval .",
    "besides of such an applicability of `` simulate '' , the notion of `` simulate '' has not been focused on , and thus , the admissibility in the sense of this paper has not been recognized .",
    "in particular , to our knowledge , it has not been appeared in the context of the second - order rate region in existing studies .",
    "since the notion of `` simulate '' plays an important role in the characterization of the rate region , it will be widely used also in the rate region in the sense of the first and second order .",
    "we refer some future studies .",
    "first , probability distributions or quantum states were assumed to be i.i.d . in this paper . to treat information sources with classical or quantum correlation , the extension from an i.i.d .",
    "sequence to general one is thought as a problem to be solved @xcite .",
    "second , we analyzed only the asymptotic performance of random number conversion and locc conversion .",
    "on the other hand , what we can operate has only finite size .",
    "therefore , it is expected that conversion via restricted storage are analyzed in finite setting .",
    "third , since only pure states were treated in quantum information setting although mixed entangled states can be appear in practice , the extension from pure states to mixed states is thought to be important .",
    "finally , we have shown that the problem of rnc via restricted storage has a non - trivial trade - off relation described by the second - order rate region although trade - off relation in the first - order rate region is quite simple . as is suggested by the results , even when two kinds of first - order rates in an information theoretical problem simply and straightforward relate with each other ,",
    "there is a possibility that the rate region has a non - trivial trade - off relation in the second order asymptotics .",
    "we can conclude that consideration of the second order asymptotics might bring a new trade - off relation in various information theoretical problems .",
