    "extensive hst emission line imagery of the narrow line regions ( nlr ) of seyfert galaxies with linear radio sources has shown that the morphology of the nlr is directly related to that of the radio emission .",
    "seyfert galaxies with a lobe - like radio morphology ( e.g. mrk 573 , mrk 78 , ngc 3393 , iras 0421 + 045 and iras 1105 - 035 ) have bow - shock shaped emission line regions ( @xcite ) , while those with a jet - like radio structure ( e.g. mrk 3 , mrk 348 , mrk 6 , mrk1066 ) have jet - like emission line structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results have provided compelling evidence for strong dynamical interactions between the emission line gas and radio - emitting ejecta on scales of @xmath3kpc .",
    "the physical foundation of this picture was first developed by taylor , dyson and axon ( 1992 ) who constructed fast bow shock models for the interaction between radio ejecta and the ism which included the effects of photo - ionization from the nucleus .",
    "dopita and sutherland ( @xcite ) have emphasized that the hot shocked gas could itself make an important local contribution to the ionizing continuum ( becoming what they termed an _ auto - ionizing _ shock ) .",
    "ngc 1068 is one of the closest seyfert galaxies and it harbours a bright radio source , with a prominent radio - jet ( @xcite ) terminating in an extended radio - lobe ( @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based kinematic studies of the nlr have been carried out previously by a number of authors ( @xcite ) in [ oiii ] @xmath4 .",
    "in particular two broad components straddling a narrow central component in the ne radio lobe were identified .",
    "the narrow component appears to follow the expected rotation curve of the galaxy and is emitted by undisturbed gas in the disk . at larger radii",
    "this triple structure disappears .",
    "the complexity of the velocity field observed in the inner region is almost certainly due to the spatial confusion caused by projection and seeing effects which mixes kinematic components from different regions along the line of sight .",
    "in particular the velocity structure created by the expansion of the hot gas associated with the lobe is projected onto the region interacting with the jet which can be spatially resolved only with hst . in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the relationship between the velocity field and the ionization conditions in the nlr gas and the interaction of the gas with the radio jet",
    "we have therefore obtained new long  slit spectroscopic observations with the faint object camera f/48 spectrograph on board the hst .",
    "our results allow us to resolve the spatial confusion and provide evidence that shocks created by the jet play a key role in forming and , possibly , ionizing the nlr of ngc 1068 . throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt a distance to ngc 1068 of 14.4 mpc ( @xcite ) where 1  corresponds to 72 pc .",
    "the narrow line region of ngc 1068 was observed using the foc f/48 long  slit spectrograph on october 18@xmath5 , 1996 at resolutions of 1.78   and 00287 per pixel along the dispersion and slit directions , respectively .",
    "the f305lp filter was used to isolate the first order spectrum which covers the 36505470   region and therefore includes the 3727 , 4861 and 4959 , 5007    emission lines .",
    "the slit , 0063x135 in size , was placed at a position angle of 83@xmath6 and spectra with exposure times of 627 seconds were taken in the 1024x512 non  zoomed mode at 6 locations separated by 1 . unfortunately , due to a guide star re - acquisition failure , only 3 of the slit locations yielded usable spectra which we identify as pos1 , pos2 and pos3 respectively .",
    "the data reduction follows the procedure described in detail by @xcite .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the observations of the spectrophotometric standard star lds749b .    to accurately determine the location of the slits we compared the surface brightness profile derived from the foc , f/96 , f501n hst image of @xcite with that measured from the spectra at the three slit positions .",
    "the best match is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : slitpos ] and is accurate to within half a slit width ( @xmath7 ) .    the slit locations pos1 and pos2 cut across the emission line filament system associated with the northern radio lobe ( @xcite ) . while the slit at pos3 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : slitpos ] ) traverses cloud g ( @xcite ) and the parallel feature to the west which form a funnel - like structure where the jet meets the radio lobe ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities derived from the  and  lines by fitting gaussian line profiles are plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : vel ] . around the jet axis , at pos3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]b ) , the lines are split into two velocity systems separated by @xmath8 1500 km . outside this region",
    "the gas motions are quiescent but with a gradient of + 500 km  from west to east .",
    "notice that the velocity splitting is not symmetric about the systemic velocity , but is much larger on the blue - shifted side .",
    "the blueshifted component is also substantially brighter and has a larger velocity dispersion than the redshifted component . at pos2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]a ) the velocity field is relatively flat , except at the filaments at slit coordinates @xmath8 -1  ",
    "-2 , where there is a large redshifted velocity perturbation of amplitude @xmath8 300 km , at a similar radial velocity to that of the redshifted component of the split line region in pos3 . pos1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]a ) shows a similar pattern in velocity , but with a reduced amplitude in the perturbed region .",
    "turning to the emission line strengths , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we show plots of representative spectra from the five regions identified in fig . [",
    "fig : slitpos ] . on the jet axis ( labeled as `` jet '' ) the gas is highly ionized ; 3759  and are clearly visible and the 4686 is as high as 0.7 the strength of , while the  emission appears to be depressed .",
    "this increase in excitation is accompanied by the presence of an excess local continuum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : new ] .    outside the jet the excitation conditions are much lower , with being relatively stronger , particularly to the e as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : new ] .",
    "the variation of the /  ratio along the slit , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , shows that there is a factor @xmath95 difference between the ratio on the jet axis and outside . the electron temperature measured from the 4363/5007 ratio",
    "give @xmath10 k. a lower limit for the electron density can be obtained from the 4710/4740 ratio and yields @xmath11 . at similar distances from the nucleus , but off the jet , ground based density measurements from 6716,6731 ratio , obtained from our unpublished spectroscopy , indicate electron densities of a few 100 .",
    "thus the increase in excitation on the jet occurs despite an increase in density .",
    "the morphological connection between the optical and radio emission in the region of the jet has been discussed in detail by gallimore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by capetti , macchetto and lattanzi ( 1997 ) .",
    "they showed that there is a clear anti - correlation between radio and optical emission , with the brightest line emitting knots surrounding the radio - jet . in the jet - cloud interaction picture",
    ", the radio jet clears a channel through the cool ism , leaving hot ionized gas in its wake and the line emission is highly enhanced along the edges of the radio - jet where the gas is compressed .",
    "the overall velocity structure and ionization conditions of the gas associated with the jet of ngc1068 can be understood in terms of this picture of an expanding and cooling cocoon around the jet which creates very fast shocks with at least @xmath12 km ( even when mass - loading of the expanding cocoon is taken into account ) .",
    "the viewing angle is such that to the ne the lobe is projected on to the disk of ngc1068 , so that the jet is seen emerging towards us out of the disk .",
    "the situation is very similar to that seen previously on the jet of 3c120 ( @xcite ) , even down to the clumpy structure of the gas , which almost certainly arises because of the onset of instabilities caused by the mixing of hot and cold material .",
    "this morphology is again readily understood if it is due to the interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "a viable explanation for the observed asymmetry of the velocity splitting is that it is due to density stratification of the disk , that is the expanding hot bubble is able to expand more rapidly along the density gradient away from the disk plane , than towards it .",
    "further weight to this argument is provided by the systematic blue - shift of coronal lines with respect to the lower excitation lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the coronal lines comes from a different kinematic component which we would ascribe to the hot cooling gas in the cocoon .",
    "the spectral diagnostics obtained from our long - slit spectra indicate that the kinematically disturbed line - emitting gas associated with the radio jet has both a higher density and a higher excitation level than the surrounding nlr .",
    "a similar result , based on narrow band imaging , has been reported recently by @xcite .",
    "the density enhancement is a factor @xmath13 100 if the ground - based measurements of the [ sii]6716,6731 ratio can be taken as typical of the regions extending away from the jet axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the variations in the [ oiii]5007/[oii]3727 ratio along the pos 3 slit imply a factor 5 enhancement in the ionization parameter ( u ) across the jet axis ( since this ratio is approximately proportional to u ; penston et al 1989 ) . the enhancements in both density _ and _ ionization parameter imply that the local ionizing radiation is a factor @xmath8 500 higher at the location of the jet in pos 3 , than it is elsewhere .",
    "the exceptionally strong [ fe vii ] and heii lines suggest that matter - bounded clouds might contribute significantly to the line emission near the jet . in this case",
    ", we will be overestimating the jump in u since low ionization lines such as [ oii ] are strongly suppressed in such clouds . nevertheless , this is unlikely to explain the whole of the inferred increase in the ionizing flux .",
    "either a local ionization source is present which dominates the agn radiation field near the jet axis , or the agn radiation field is itself highly anisotropic .",
    "the most important local ionization source is likely to be ionizing radiation ( free - free and high ionization line emission ) from gas heated and ionized in fast shocks driven by the radio jet ( @xcite ; @xcite ; dopita & sutherland 1996a , b ) .",
    "the strong [ fe vii ] emission and the excess continuum observed on the jet axis may be a clue that the coronal gas expected in this picture is indeed present .",
    "alternatively , the on - axis increase in the ionizing flux could be attributed to intrinsic anisotropy of the nuclear continuum . in this case , the size of the enhancement in flux , and the fact that it is highly localized , require a continuum beaming factor comparable with doppler boosting in a moderately relativistic jet ( gamma   a few ) .",
    "this idea can be ruled out because the region we have studied occurs after a significant bend of the jet and therefore one would expect to see higher excitation along the orginal jet direction , which is not observed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "perhaps a more likely explanation is that the continuum anisotropy is largely produced by azimuthal variations in the optical depth to ionizing photons . in this picture",
    ", the radio jet sweeps out a channel as it passes through the nlr with the result that ionizing radiation from the central source suffers much less attenuation along its axis than in other directions .",
    "our results on pos1 and pos2 can also be interpreted in terms of the interaction between the radio plasma and the ambient gas , but in this case it is the expanding lobe material which is driving the motion . from our spectroscopic data",
    "we can say little on the ionization conditions of these filaments because only the [ o iii ] lines are detected .",
    "we have presented new hst foc f/48 long  slit spectra of the central 4 arcseconds of the nlr of ngc 1068 . at a spatial scale of 00287 per pixel these data provide an order of magnitude improvement in resolution over previous ground based spectra and allow us to trace the interaction between the radio jet and the gas in the nlr .",
    "our results show that , within @xmath0 of the radio - jet the emission lines are split into two components whose velocity separation is @xmath8 1500 km  and are clearly the result of the interaction between the radio jet and the ambient nlr material .",
    "the filaments associated with the radio lobe also show a redshifted kinematic disturbance of the order of 300 km which probably is a consequence of the expansion of the radio plasma .",
