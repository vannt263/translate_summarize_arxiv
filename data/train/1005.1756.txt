    "the top quark is substantially more massive than the other known quarks . simply by virtue of this fact , the top quark couples more strongly to the particles that generate the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak interactions .",
    "it is possible that the large mass of the top quark is explained by new interactions of the top quark .",
    "it is thus important to measure the properties of the top quark carefully , searching for signals of special interactions of this quark .",
    "particularly interesting quantities to study are the form factors that describe the coupling of the top quark to elementary currents .",
    "these are the analogues for any new interactions of the proton form factors , which played such a large role in the elucidation of qcd",
    ". we will study the process @xmath0 . in this reaction , two sets of form factors enter , the form factors that describe the @xmath8 and @xmath2 couplings to @xmath9 , which describe the @xmath9 production vertex , and the the form factors that describe the @xmath3 coupling to @xmath10 , which describe the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay vertices . as a matter of principle",
    ", a full reconstruction of the @xmath9 system in @xmath13 annihilation can give information on both sets of vertices .",
    "the effects of the possible form factors on observables of the @xmath9 system have been studied by many authors , for example , @xcite . some of these couplings will be constrained at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , but others are very difficult to access there . in particular , the vector and axial vector couplings of the top quark to the @xmath2 boson are shifted by new physics effects in many models  @xcite . however , these couplings are very difficult to measure precisely at the lhc , and the associated form factors are completely inaccessible at values of @xmath14 larger than @xmath15 .    in this paper , we will begin a study of the determination of these form factors under realistic experimental conditions at the proposed future @xmath13 collider , the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "we will make use of the detector model given by the silicon detector ( sid ) concept and the set of full - simulation tools developed for the benchmarking of sid  @xcite .",
    "these tools provide a very detailed simulation of the experimental environment at the ilc .",
    "we will consider the forward - backward asymmetries both for the @xmath4 and @xmath16 quarks and for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks . in each case , the forward - backward asymmetry is defined as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cross section of the events in which the @xmath4 or @xmath11 quark has a polar angle of less than @xmath19 in the centre of mass frame of reference .",
    "the standard spherical coordinate system convention is used to define @xmath20 .",
    "this asymmetry measurement is a complex analysis in a dense multi - jet environment .",
    "typical events have 6-jet final states .",
    "flavor - tagging must be done to identify the @xmath4 quark jets and resolve the combinatoric ambiguities .",
    "quark charges must be measured to distinguish the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decay products .",
    "detector resolution and acceptance together with non - ideal efficiency and purity of the reconstruction algorithms could play a critical role in determining the ultimate sensitivity of the measurement and hence its physics reach .",
    "this study addresses these issues for the first time .",
    "our conclusion is that , with the beam conditions and integrated luminosities that the ilc will provide , a well - designed detector can overcome these potential problems and realize the small measurement uncertainties that were projected in parametric studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives general parameters of top quark production at the ilc .",
    "section iii introduces the sid detector concept .",
    "section iv presents the software framework used in this analysis .",
    "section v describes the signal selection and the calculation of the cross section for the fully hadronic @xmath9 final state .",
    "this section also discusses the flavor - tagging method and its performance .",
    "section vi is devoted to the quark charge reconstruction algorithms , which are fundamental to the analysis .",
    "the results for forward - backward asymmetries are presented in section vii .",
    "section viii puts these results in context by interpreting them as bounds on deviations of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 form factors from their standard model values .",
    "section ix gives out conclusions .",
    "the international linear collider is a proposed electron - positron accelerator operating in the centre of mass energy range @xmath23 200 gev - 500 gev .",
    "an upgrade to the centre of mass energy of 1 tev is also envisaged as are possible calibration runs at the z boson mass energy @xcite .",
    "the maximum design luminosity is 2 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath26 s@xmath27 . in the analysis presented here the centre of mass energy and total integrated luminosity",
    "were assumed to be respectively 500 gev and 500 fb@xmath27 , the latter one equivalent to a few years of ilc running .",
    "the top quark at the ilc , assuming the 500 gev operation , is mainly produced in pairs through the @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes .",
    "the theoretical total cross - section of top quark pair production is approximately 600 fb @xcite .",
    "although this value is substantially lower than the one at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the clean environment , well defined initial state and polarization make the ilc an ideal machine to perform top quark precision measurements .",
    "the top quark properties are studied with silicon detector concept which is a general purpose detector designed to perform precision measurements and at the same time to be sensitive to a wide range of possible new phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is based on a five layer silicon pixel vertex detector , silicon tracking with single bunch time stamping capabilities , silicon - tungsten electromagnetic calorimetry and a highly segmented hadronic calorimeter . the particle flow algorithm ( pfa )",
    "@xcite is an important strategy driving the basic philosophy and layout of the detector .",
    "sid also incorporates a five tesla solenoid , an iron flux return and a muon identification system . a schematic view of sid quadrant is shown in figure [ f : sidcut ] .",
    "the event generation has been performed using the whizard mc generator @xcite .",
    "event samples were created with the expected ilc baseline parameters of 80% electron and 30% positron polarization .",
    "half of the event sample was created with a positive electron and negative positron polarization , while the other half has been created with a negative electron and positive positron polarization .",
    "whizard was used to generate samples of all 0 , 2 , 4 , and 6 fermion final states as well as top quark - dominated 8 fermion processes .",
    "this generation used electroweak vertices only , with gluon emission turned off .",
    "the intent of this strategy was to correctly describe multifermion processes such as return to the @xmath2 ( @xmath30 fermions ) and similar processes with intermediate off - shell @xmath3 bosons .",
    "these reactions with @xmath11-channel exchange and off - shell electroweak bosons are the most important backgrounds to multi - fermion @xmath13 annihilation processes .",
    "qcd was included in the events by using pythia to evolve final - state quarks through parton showering , fragmentation , and decay .",
    "pythia@xcite was also used to generate final - state photon radiation .",
    "there is no double - counting of multi - fermion production between the whizard stage and the parton shower stage .",
    "this procedure treats multi - gluon radiation only approximately and ignores quantum interference between the electroweak and qcd production amplitudes .",
    "however , these are relatively small effects at the ilc and are unimportant except in dedicated qcd studies .",
    "about 7 million events were created and processed through the full geant 4@xcite detector simulation , with individual events weighted to reflect the statistical sampling . however all of the 6 and 8 fermion states , the ones most relevant for the analysis , were left unweighted .",
    "the sample has been subsequently divided into @xmath31 final states , which constituted the signal and all remaining events representing the background .",
    "in addition to this ` pseudo data ' events a further independent sample of 2 million @xmath32 events was used for the calibration of algorithms .",
    "the jet clustering algorithm used in this analysis is the y - cut algorithm @xcite with the number of jets fixed at six to match the number of jets expected for a hadronic @xmath33 event .",
    "the analysis starts with a simple event selection based on several global variables described below .",
    "events with isolated leptons , defined as a jet containing only one reconstructed particle which is either an electron or a muon are rejected as only the @xmath31 final state was considered .",
    "subsequently a set of kinematic and topological discriminating variables has been defined : the total energy of the event ; the jet finder @xmath35 parameter , which represents the y - cut separation between the five and six jet hypothesis ; the number of particles and the number of tracks .",
    "the number of particles in the event is defined as the number of reconstructed particles identified by the pfa .",
    "figure [ f : cuts1 ] shows distributions of these variables for the signal and background samples before any selections .",
    "table [ t : eventselect1 ] presents the kinematic and topological event selections that have been used .",
    ".list of the kinematic and topological event selections . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can be inferred from table [ t : bassprediction ] that the measurement of the the b quark forward - backward asymmetry is sensitive to the presence of a @xmath36 anomalous form factor whose absolute value is greater than approximately 0.05 .",
    "measurement of other observables , not considered in this paper , that specifically target the top quark decay properties will put much stronger constraints on both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that there is a difference between the asymmetry predicted by the whizard generator which was used for these studies , 0.291 , and the asymmetry by the comphep mc generator @xcite used when calculating the theoretical predictions @xcite , 0.279 .",
    "part of the discrepancy can also be explained by the fact that the generated signal sample is an all inclusive @xmath38 rather than @xmath39 as assumed in the theoretical paper . in any event , this difference is not significant for the purpose of sensitivity estimation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the achievable resolution for the forward backward asymmetry of the top quark at the ilc in the @xmath34 channel is approximately 0.008 for a total luminosity of 500 fb@xmath27 .",
    "similarly the achievable resolution for the @xmath4 quark resulting from the top decay is also 0.008 . in the case of polarized beams the achievable resolution for both",
    "the top and bottom quark asymmetries is 0.010 and 0.012 for the -80% electron polarization , + 30% positron polarization and the + 80% electron polarization , -30% positron polarization respectively .",
    "this result allows to constrain the theoretically predicted deviations from the standard model in the presence of an anomalous coupling of the @xmath40 and @xmath22 vertices . in the case of the @xmath40 coupling",
    "the resolution on the predicted standard model form factor is of the order of 0.05 and 0.04 for the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 couplings respectively . in the case of the @xmath22",
    "the performed analysis is sensitive to the presence of an @xmath43 anomalous form factor greater that approximately 0.05 .",
    "the analysis employed realistic detector simulations and advanced reconstruction algorithms in the framework of the silicon detector concept . a new quark charge reconstruction algorithm used to discriminate between bottom quarks and their anti - quarks allowed to achieve a selection purity of up to 80% for an efficiency of about 60% .",
    "we would like to thank the colleagues from the sid software and benchmarking groups , in particular jan strube , tim barklow , norman graf and john jaros for assistance with sample processing and useful discussions .",
