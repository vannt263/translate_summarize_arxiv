    "more than fifty years ago stoner proposed a simple route to ferromagnetism in itinerant systems based on the competition between one - body and interaction ( exchange ) energy @xcite .",
    "the repulsive interaction energy can be minimized when the fermionic antisymmetry requirement is satisfied by the spatial wavefunction , as the overlap between different wavefunctions is then minimal .",
    "this effect favors the alignment of spins and , if the interaction is sufficiently strong , results in a large ground - state spin magnetization .",
    "this mechanism is the primary origin of hund s first rule in atomic physics .",
    "in contrast , when the interaction is weak minimal spin is favored , since in order to align spins electrons must be promoted from lower , doubly - occupied levels to higher singly - occupied levels and the cost in one - body energy is prohibitive . because the pauli principle is essentially local , ferromagnetism in metals has been studied within models such as the hubbard model @xcite which only retain the short - range part of the electronic interaction ; the long - range part of the interaction being assumed to give spin - independent contributions to the ground - state energy ( the capacitance or charging energy ) . in the case of a hubbard interaction , only pairs of electrons of opposite spin interact .",
    "the number of such pairs is a monotonically decreasing function of the total magnetization @xmath8 $ ] where @xmath0 is the number of electrons and @xmath9 the total spin @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as just noted , flipping a spin requires the promotion of an electron to a higher one - body level and in the case of a finite system with a discrete spectrum of average spacing @xmath10 , a magnetization @xmath9 requires an energy @xmath11 .",
    "a simple first order perturbation treatment shows then that a sufficiently strong interaction results in a finite magnetization , when the corresponding reduction in interaction energy counterbalances the increase in kinetic ( one - body ) energy    @xmath12    this occurs when the typical exchange interaction @xmath13 between two states close to the fermi energy is equal to the one - particle level spacing which for a hubbard interaction @xmath14 reads    @xmath15 and this threshold is known as the _ stoner instability_. as both the kinetic energy and the interaction energy have the same parametric dependence on the magnetization @xmath9 , reaching this threshold results in a second order phase transition to a ferromagnetic phase , the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility , and a macroscopic magnetization .    quite naturally one may wonder in what way does the presence of a disordered potential modify this stoner picture , and this question has recently attracted a lot of attention , both in the context of bulk metals ( i.e. infinitely extended systems with diffusive eigenstates ) and in finite - sized metallic systems such as quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles .",
    "two types of questions have been considered : 1 ) the effect of a disordered potential on the _ average _ threshold for the stoner instability .",
    "2 ) the statistical properties of the threshold in an ensemble of mesoscopic metallic samples .",
    "both aspects have been recently investigated theoretically . for the bulk case , it has been known for some time @xcite that within perturbation theory disorder enhances the exchange effect in the susceptibility ; recently andreev and kamenev constructed a mean - field theory which they argue describes the stoner transition @xcite and found a significant reduction of the stoner threshold in low - dimensional disordered systems due to correlations in diffusive wavefunctions which enhance the average exchange term . in the framework of the same mean - field approach which neglects the fluctuations of the interactions , but takes into account those of the one - body spectrum , kurland , aleiner and altshuler proposed that below , but in the immediate vicinity of the stoner instability , there is a broad distribution of magnetization and that each sample s free energy is characterized by a large number of local magnetization minima @xcite .",
    "brouwer , oreg and halperin @xcite considered the effect of mesoscopic wavefunction fluctuations on the exchange interaction and found that their effect was to increase substantially the probability of non - zero spin magnetization in the ground state before the stoner threshold is reached .",
    "baranger , ullmo and glazman @xcite suggested that the observed `` kinks '' in the parametric variations of coulomb blockade peak positions ( e.g. as one varies an external magnetic field ) could reflect changes in the ground state spin of the quantum dot .",
    "it was noted that the statistical occurence of nonzero ground - state magnetizations can account for the absence of bimodality of the conductance peak spacings distribution for tunneling experiments with quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "another aspect of large disordered metallic samples is that the stoner threshold can be locally exceeded , while the exchange averaged over the full sample has a value well below the threshold . in this case",
    "one may expect that localized regions with nonzero magnetization will be formed even though the full system is nonmagnetic .",
    "this scenario has been investigated by narozhny , aleiner and larkin @xcite who also considered the effect of such _ local spin droplets _ on dephasing .",
    "they found that the probability to form a local spin droplet though exponentially small , does not rigorously vanish as it would in a clean system , and that neither this probability , nor the corresponding spin depends on the droplet s size . in a different approach focusing on the large interaction regime close to half - filling , eisenberg and berkovits numerically found that the presence of disorder may stabilize nagaoka - like ferromagnetic phases at larger number of holes ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , stopa has suggested that scarring of one - body wavefunctions in a chaotic confining potential may lead to strong enhancements of the exchange interaction and to the occurence of few - electron polarization in finite - sized systems @xcite .",
    "thus the general message of these works is that disorder tends to favor novel magnetic states over paramagnetic states .      in a recent letter @xcite , we pointed out a competing effect of interactions in disordered systems which _ reduces _ the probability of ground - state magnetization and hence favors paramagnetism",
    "this effect had not ( to our knowledge ) been treated in any of the previous works on itinerant magnetization of disordered systems .",
    "the works cited above neglect the effect of disorder in inducing fluctuations in the _ off - diagonal _ interaction matrix elements @xcite .",
    "however it is well - known from studies of complex few - body systems like nuclei and atoms @xcite that the band - width of the many - body density of states in finite interacting fermi systems is strongly modified by the fluctuations of these off - diagonal matrix elements already at moderate strength of the interactions .",
    "such studies did not directly address the effect of this broadening on the ground - state spin of the system .",
    "however our extension of these models immediately revealed that these fluctuations are largest for the states of minimal spin , due to the larger number of final states ( non - zero interaction matrix elements ) for interaction - induced transitions ( we will review this argument below ) .",
    "this effect then significantly increases the probability that the extremal ( low - energy ) states in the band are those of minimal spin and opposes the exchange effect . in our earlier works @xcite we focused on the regime of large fluctuations to deduce the scaling properties of the ground - state energy as a function of spin , and verified these scaling laws with numerical tests . in the present work",
    "we will review and extend these results for large fluctuations , but we will focus mostly on the perturbative regime of small @xmath2 .",
    "while in this regime the correction to the ground - state energy due to fluctuations is small by assumption , one is able to evaluate these corrections analytically and show that they favor minimal spin for an arbitrary number of particles . specifically , the larger number of interaction - induced transitions for lower spin leads to more and larger interaction contributions to the ( negative ) second - order correction to the ground - state energy in each spin block .",
    "this illustrates explicitly the `` phase - space '' argument introduced in @xcite which implies that fluctuations generically suppress magnetization .",
    "we expect this effect to be significant in quantum dots where it will reduce the probability of high spin ground states .",
    "we recall that the ground state spin of lateral quantum dots can be experimentally determined by following the motion of coulomb blockade conductance peaks as an in - plane magnetic field is applied @xcite .",
    "therefore the strength of the demagnetizing effect of fluctuations of interaction is experimentally accessible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we start by an explicit derivation of our model and describe its main features . in section [ tip ]",
    "we begin for pedagogical reasons with an analytical treatment of the model for the case of only two particles , in both the perturbative regime of weak off - diagonal fluctuations and the asymptotic regime where they dominate .",
    "section [ pert ] will be devoted to a second order perturbative treatment of the model for an arbitrary number of particles ; this will be followed in section [ tbrim ] by a discussion of the magnetization properties of the system s ground state in the asymptotic regime . as noted above ,",
    "some of the results presented there have already been presented in @xcite but are nevertheless included to make the article self - contained . in the next section [ six ] we consider the competition between exchange and fluctuations in more details , both from the point of view of average stoner threshold and in terms of probability of finding a polarized ground - state .",
    "we will see in particular that the off - diagonal fluctuations induce a term @xmath17 in the hamiltonian which delays the stoner instability and a second term @xmath18 which strongly suppresses the occurence of large ground - state spins even above the stoner instability . in section [ realsp ]",
    "we consider more standard microscopic models for disordered interacting fermions and relate their properties to our generic model of fluctuating interactions .",
    "we determine the conditions to be satisfied in order for the results obtained from our random interaction model to be relevant in different physical situations .",
    "finally we summarize our findings , put them in perspective and discuss possible extensions of this work in the final section [ concl ] .",
    "our starting point is a lattice model for fermions in a disordered potential coupled by a two - body , spin - independent interaction of arbitrary range .",
    "we make a unitary transformation to the basis of single - particle eigenstates of the disordered potential and introduce the assumption that the single - particle states are random and uncorrelated . upon averaging over disorder we arrive at a completely generic model describing both the nonvanishing average interactions ( exchange , charging and bcs ) and the statistical fluctuations in both the one and two - body terms .",
    "finally we introduce the assumption that all interaction matrix elements have the same statistical variance .",
    "hence our construction excludes both one - body integrable systems and strongly - localized systems .",
    "we also note that with this assumption geometric or commensurability effects ( such as spin waves or antiferromagnetic instabilities ) can not be captured by our treatment , as the statistical character of the construction erases most real - space details of the model .",
    "we consider the following tight - binding hamiltonian for @xmath0 spin-@xmath19 particles    @xmath20    @xmath21 is a spin index , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion on the i@xmath24 site of a @xmath25-dimensional lattice of linear dimension @xmath26 and volume @xmath27 .",
    "this latter quantity defines the number @xmath28 of spin - degenerate one - body eigenenergies which we will refer to as _",
    "orbitals _ in what follows , @xmath29 is the lattice constant .",
    "@xmath30 is a one - body , spin independent , disordered hamiltonian with eigenvalues @xmath31 and eigenvectors @xmath32 , i.e. one has    @xmath33    where @xmath34 refers to a lattice site ket .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 has no degeneracy besides twofold spin - degeneracy and distribute the @xmath36 different one - body energies as @xmath37 $ ] so as to fix @xmath38 without spin degeneracy .",
    "below we will discuss three different eigenvalue distributions : constant spacing distribution @xcite ( @xmath39 , note that due to the level degeneracy the single - particle level spacing is @xmath10 , whereas @xmath40 is the mean level spacing ) , randomly distributed @xmath31 with a poisson spacing distribution , or with a wigner - dyson spacing distribution .",
    "finally @xmath41 is the electron - electron interaction potential and @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian is spin rotational symmetric ( srs ) so that both the total spin @xmath43 and its projection @xmath44 commute with the hamiltonian and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath9 and @xmath45 are good quantum numbers .",
    "this results in a block structure of the hamiltonian @xmath46 which will be described in detail below . performing the unitary transformation defined by    @xmath47    we rewrite the hamiltonian as    @xmath48    where the interaction matrix elements ( ime ) are given by    @xmath49    these ime induce transitions between many - body states differing by at most two one - body occupation numbers .",
    "the distribution and properties of the ime depend on both the range of the interaction potential and the one - particle dynamics .",
    "if there are conserved quantities other than energy in the one - particle dynamics ( and hence good quantum numbers describing the one - body states ) this will lead to selection rules in the ime ; the extreme case of this would be an integrable one - particle hamiltonian for which a complete set of quantum numbers exists .",
    "selection rules greatly reduce the number of allowed interaction - induced transitions , and lead to a very singular distribution of ime ( this is most easily seen by considering a clean hypercubic lattice model with hubbard interaction ) .",
    "perturbing a clean lattice with a disordered potential destroys translational symmetry and these selection rules disappear , which induces a crossover of the distribution of ime from a set of @xmath50functions to a smooth distribution . in fig.[fig : puodt1t2 ] we illustrate this by plotting the distribution of ime for a one - dimensional lattice model with on - site disorder , nearest and next - nearest - neighbor hopping and a hubbard interaction as described e.g. in reference @xcite .",
    "the key assumption of our model is that such a smooth distribution of interaction matrix elements exists and that in fact all matrix elements which preserve srs _ have the same nonzero variance _",
    "( these matrix elements may vanish on average of course ) .",
    "this assumption rules out both the case of integrable one - body dynamics as discussed above , and the case of strongly - localized wavefunctions for which interaction matrix elements between states separated spatially by more than a localization length will have different ( and much smaller ) variance than those in the same localization volume .",
    "our assumption is reasonable for metallic disordered states with a randomness generated by either impurities or chaotic boundary scattering .    with this motivation ,",
    "we assume that the fluctuations of the off - diagonal @xmath51 are random with a zero - centered gaussian distribution of width @xmath2 .",
    "only matrix elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 have nonzero averages @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 which lead ( respectively ) to mean - field charge - charge , spin - spin and bcs - like interaction terms . note that the average of both the exchange and bcs terms is dominated by the short - range part of the interaction , and that @xmath58 vanishes as time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "consequently , the electronic interactions give us four contributions .",
    "the first three are the average charge - charge , ferromagnetic spin - spin and bcs terms that we just discussed and which can be written as ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 . )",
    "@xmath61 n ( n+1)/2 - \\lambda u \\vec{s } \\cdot \\vec{s } + \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta } \\langle u_{\\alpha,\\alpha}^{\\beta,\\beta } \\rangle c^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha,\\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha,\\downarrow } c_{\\beta,\\downarrow } c_{\\beta,\\uparrow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced spin operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that the strength of the average ferromagnetic exchange term has been written in units of the rms fluctuation @xmath2 , i.e. we have introduced a parameter @xmath64 which is the ratio of the average exchange to the fluctuations    @xmath65    much in the same spirit as the usual stoner picture where another energy ratio @xmath66 , between the exchange energy and the one - body energy spacing at the fermi level , is the relevant parameter .    the fourth interaction contribution to our model hamiltonian goes beyond the mean - field approximation and contains the off - diagonal fluctuations of the electronic interactions    @xmath67    having removed the average interactions , we now assume that both the diagonal and off - diagonal ime @xmath68 have zero - centered uncorrelated gaussian distributions @xmath69 of width @xmath2 .",
    "we stress that in general , not all ime have the same variance but being interested in generic features of the interaction , we will neglect these variance discrepancies .",
    "@xmath70 contains three kind of matrix elements , the variances of which depend on the number of transferred one - body occupancies between the connected slater determinants .",
    "diagonal matrix elements @xmath71 ( @xmath72 denotes a slater determinant ) have a variance @xmath73 , one - body off - diagonal elements that change only one occupancy have a variance @xmath74 whereas generic two - body off - diagonal matrix elements inducing transitions between slater determinants differing by exactly two occupancies , have the generic variance @xmath75 . in diagrammatic language , these discrepancies occur due to the presence of up to two closed loops in the diagram corresponding to these matrix elements , each loop corresponding to a sum over @xmath76 uncorrelated ime .",
    "our full hamiltonian then reads    @xmath77    the mean - field hamiltonian proposed in @xcite was constructed along similar lines but neglects the fluctuations of interaction @xmath78 and is thus embedded in the above hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "consequently , all results derived there can be obtained from the treatment to be presented below after setting the strength of fluctuations @xmath79 . in a condensed matter context",
    "this is justified in the limit of large conductance @xmath80 .",
    "as recent experiments in quantum dots seem to be consistant with a conductance @xmath81 @xcite , it is a priori not obvious that @xmath70 can be neglected .",
    "we also stress that both the random matrix theory ( rmt ) symmetry under orthogonal ( or unitary ) basis transformation in the one - body hilbert space ( which in metallic samples is satisfied for energy scales smaller than the thouless energy @xmath82 @xcite ) , and the @xmath83 symmetry under rotation in spin space are satisfied by each of the three terms in the above hamiltonian .",
    "the charge - charge mean - field contribution results in a constant energy shift of the full spectrum and has thus no influence on the ground - state spin ; we therefore neglect it henceforth .",
    "this must however be kept in mind , as it is for instance well known that including self - consistently the mean - field charge - charge contribution of the interactions ( e.g. in a hartree - fock approach ) leads to significant corrections to the one - particle density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the bcs term gives rise to superconducting fluctuations for a negative effective interaction in the cooper channel @xmath84 .",
    "we shall only consider disordered metallic samples which have @xmath85 . in this case",
    "the renormalization group flow brings the bcs coupling to zero @xcite .",
    "we thus also neglect this term and set @xmath86 .",
    "note however that the presence of a nonzero ( repulsive or attractive ) bcs coupling may stabilize a paramagnetic phase .",
    "after these considerations we reach our model hamiltonian    @xmath87    due to the srs that we imposed on the original hamiltonian ( [ hamsite ] ) , the interaction commutes with the total magnetization @xmath88 and its projection @xmath44 so that the hamiltonian acquires a block structure where blocks are labelled by a quantum number @xmath45 and subblocks of given @xmath89 appear within each of these blocks .",
    "each block s size is given in term of binomial coefficients as @xmath90 , while the size of a subblock of given @xmath9 is given by @xmath91 .",
    "due to srs it is sufficient to study the block with lowest projection @xmath92 @xmath93 for even ( odd ) number of particles , as all values of @xmath9 will be included in this block . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider an even number @xmath0 of particles in the initial discussion presented below , and will generalize the discussion later on to include odd @xmath0 , highlighting the main differences between the two cases .",
    "it is important to remark that both @xmath9 and @xmath45 are not only good quantum numbers for the full hamiltonian , but also individually for @xmath30 , @xmath94 and @xmath78 .",
    "this allows us to consider each of these terms separately and in the next two chapters we will make use of this property , first neglecting @xmath95 : as it only generates constant energy shifts within each sector , it can be added after the restricted problem @xmath96 has been solved .    in ( [ od ] ) the sums in both",
    "the spin and orbital indices are not restricted , i.e @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is both convenient and instructive to rewrite it as    @xmath99    where we have introduced totally symmetric and antisymmetric matrix elements    @xmath100    as well as two - body creation and destruction operators for either singlet - paired    @xmath101    or triplet - paired fermions    @xmath102    as we consider fully uncorrelated ime @xmath103 , both the symmetrized and antisymmetrized matrix elements have the same variance which for no doubly appearing indices reads    @xmath104    in principle , the ratio of the variances strongly depends on microscopic details , in particular the range of the interaction .",
    "for instance , it can easily be seen that @xmath105 $ ] and that the ratio vanishes for a hubbard interaction .",
    "we will neglect this discrepancy however , but note that an increased variance of the symmetrized ime with respect to the antisymmetrized ones favors a low spin ground - state @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can now be regarded as acting on singlet or triplet bonds between levels .",
    "srs is then reflected in the simple statement that the destruction of a bond between two fermions must be followed by the re - creation of a bond of the same nature .",
    "we note that the triplet operators ( [ triplet0 ] ) create either a @xmath92 , @xmath106 or a @xmath107 , @xmath106 two - fermion state in a fixed spin basis .",
    "a rotation in spin space would bring the operators in ( [ triplet0 ] ) into one another and the first three terms in the brackets in ( [ usrs ] ) are not individually srs but must be considered as one single spin - conserving operator .",
    "we illustrate this point in appendix [ appendix1 ] , where we evaluate the effect of this operator acting on a four - particle state with two double occupancies .",
    "note also that from ( [ ime ] ) and ( [ symasym ] ) , a purely on - site interaction influences only the singlet channel as in this case the antisymmetrized ime vanish identically",
    ".    the procedure leading to ( [ usrs ] ) amounts to a projection of the interaction operator onto the two irreducible representations of the two - fermion symmetry group . in this way",
    "the two - body singlet matrix elements are explicitly separated from their triplet counterparts , and the rewriting leading to ( [ usrs ] ) allows us to formulate the many - body problem in term of two - particles bonds of different nature in a similar way as the authors of @xcite .",
    "any even @xmath0-fermion state is represented as a @xmath108-boson state where each boson has either spin @xmath109 or 1 .",
    "these bosons can be constructed by acting on the vacuum @xmath110 with an @xmath5 or a @xmath111 operator respectively , and the spin of these composite bosonic states depends on the bond between the two fermions , i.e. whether the fermionic antisymmetry is supported by the spin or the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "alternatively , this means that for a @xmath0-body state of total spin @xmath9 , the number of triplet bonds is given by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "also double orbital occupancies result in singlet bonds , so that their number is restricted to @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "this construction leads however to an overcomplete basis for @xmath113 .",
    "we were unable to propose a systematic reduction to an orthonormal set of states nor are we aware of any such systematic construction in the literature . for",
    "the computations to be carried below it will however be sufficient to know that such a basis can in principle be constructed ( via e.g. reduction and orthogonalization of the constructed overcomplete basis ) , and how to construct it for the special case of four particles above the filled fermi sea , as those are the only states one encounters when doing second order perturbation theory for the levels of lowest energy in the @xmath109 and 1 sectors .",
    "equation ( [ usrs ] ) helps us see the key qualitative point of our work . in second order perturbation",
    "theory @xmath70 will generate transitions in each spin sub - block between the ground state and excited states differing by two occupation numbers ( or less ) .",
    "both the triplet and singlet terms will generate transitions , but there are certain types of transitions which can be generated by the singlet term which _ can not _ be generated by the triplet term . for instance the triplet operator can not generate transitions to final states with additional double occupancies nor is it possible to scatter a triplet bonded pair into a double occupancy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . as the magnetization increases ,",
    "the number of singlet transitions decreases accordingly as the number of singlet two - particle bonds in a many - body state obviously decreases with its total magnetization . eventually ,",
    "when @xmath9 is maximal , only triplet transitions survive and we can readily conclude that the number of two - body transitions is a monotonically decreasing function of the magnetization as is therefore the number of ( energy - decreasing ) second order contributions .",
    "we will see below that this condition on the available volume for phase - space scattering is crucial for the ground - state magnetization properties , both in the perturbative regime ( @xmath114 ) and in the asymptotic limit of dominant fluctuations ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "it is important to understand that the relevant variable here is the number of transitions and not the size of the hilbert space ; the block size @xmath116 is in general ( for a sufficient number of particles ) a nonmonotonic function of @xmath9 , as on one hand @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 for odd number of particles ) , whereas on the other hand , and in the limit @xmath119 , it can be shown using stirling s formula that @xmath120 . except for very few particles",
    ", @xmath116 has its maximum at a finite magnetization , whereas the number of transitions is always maximum for @xmath109 .",
    "we close this introductory chapter with a brief historical survey of random interaction models similar to ( [ hamfin]-[usrs ] ) .",
    "these models originated in nuclear physics and are based on similar principles as those which led wigner to propose the gaussian ensembles of random matrices , with the additional requirement that they represent particles interacting via a @xmath121-body interaction . only when the rank @xmath121 of the interaction is equal to the number @xmath0 of particles",
    "does one recover the wigner gaussian ensembles .",
    "physically , interactions are in principle not random _ per se _ , however once one postulates the invariance of the one - body hamiltonian matrix ensemble under unitary ( i.e. basis ) transformation , a postulate motivated e.g. by a chaotic one - body dynamics , random ime naturally appear ( see ( [ ime ] ) ) , and this results in a similar invariance for the many - body hamiltonian ensemble and the associated probability distribution @xmath122 .",
    "the first proposed model with random interactions was the fermionic two - body random interaction model ( tbrim ) for spinless fermions which was introduced independently by french and wong and bohigas and flores @xcite .",
    "this model is essentially a spinless version of @xmath78 .",
    "while significant deviations from the usual gaussian ensemble of random matrices were found in the tails of the spectrum - in particular the mbdos for @xmath123 has a gaussian , not a semicircular shape - these authors found no significant differences in the spectral properties at high excitation energy .",
    "( this latter finding has been however challenged very recently @xcite and may be due to the smallness of the systems considered . ) more recently this spinless tbrim was extended with a one - body part and it has been discovered that the critical interaction strength @xmath124 at which wd statistics sets in is governed by the energy spacings @xmath125 between directly coupled states @xcite . this model and similar ones have also been studied in the framework of quantum chaos in atomic physics @xcite , in particular the thermalization of few - body isolated systems has attracted a significant attention @xcite , and more recently in solid - state physics to study quasiparticle lifetime @xcite and fluctuations of coulomb blockade conductance peak spacings and heights in quantum dots @xcite . in a solid - state context",
    "however the invariance of the one - body hamiltonian under basis transformation is satisfied only in an energy interval of the order of the thouless energy @xmath126 around the fermi energy , where @xmath127 is the conductance @xcite .",
    "wavefunctions correlations become stronger and stronger beyond the thouless energy where ime start to decay algebraically as a function of the energy .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider our random interaction model as an effective truncated hamiltonian in an energy window given by the thouless energy @xmath128 $ ] @xcite , so that the number of particles and orbitals behave as @xmath129,@xmath130 .",
    "nuclear shell models may also be represented by randomly interacting models , differing from the original tbrim in the presence of additional quantum numbers like spin , isospin , parity and so forth@xcite .",
    "most of those models consider the limit of dominant fluctuations @xmath115 and quite unexpectedly , it has been found that even in this regime , random interactions may result in an orderly behavior @xcite , in particular a strong statistical bias toward a low angular momentum ground - state . in particular , for the special case of an angular momentum restricted to @xmath131 , the probability of finding a zero angular momentum ground - state for an even number of nucleons reaches almost 100% @xcite .",
    "while the reasons for this behavior in the asymptotic regime are still not clear @xcite , we will see below that a strong bias toward low angular momentum ground - state results from a stronger broadening of the many - body density of states ( mbdos ) in the low spin sector , associated with a larger number of off - diagonal transitions .",
    "the same phenomenon with qualitatively the same origin will be shown to influence the ground - state magnetization in the perturbative limit .",
    "for @xmath133 particles , only the sectors @xmath109 and @xmath134 exist whose size is given by @xmath135 . in each sector , the interaction matrix @xmath78 is a goe matrix ( the number of particles is equal to the rank of the interaction ) and all hamiltonian matrix elements are non - zero and have the same variance . for simplest case of two orbitals ( @xmath136 ) one can demonstrate the magnetization reducing effect of interaction fluctuations by an argument which is _ exact _ for all values of the off - diagonal fluctuations @xmath2 .",
    "the two orbitals are spin - degenerate and have energies @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in the absence of interaction fluctuations , the three eigenvalues in the @xmath109 sector are @xmath139 , @xmath10 and @xmath140 . switching on the interaction , the determinant of the hamiltonian matrix in the time - reversal symmetric case can be written    @xmath141\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    every single term in this expression has a symmetric distribution , i.e. an equal probability of being positive or negative , except for a term @xmath142 which is always negative .",
    "it results that the determinant has a higher probability of being negative which in its turn means that the lowest eigenvalue ( which vanishes at @xmath143 ) is statistically more often negative than positive when @xmath2 is switched on - it is more likely to be reduced than increased by the off - diagonal fluctuations . simultaneously , and in absence of exchange , the energy of the only @xmath106 level is given by @xmath144 , so that the fluctuations lower or increase it with equal probability . hence fluctuations always increase the average spin gap in this case .",

    "this set of rules is similar to the one employed by kaplan , papenbrock and johnson @xcite for the case of @xmath195 particles .",
    "as noted above , the generalization to more particles is not trivial : following the above prescription , one obtains an overcomplete basis and one should construct a proper orthogonalization procedure to reduce this basis . in",
    "what follows however we will compute perturbative corrections up to the second order for only three different states : the @xmath109 and @xmath106 yrast states ( @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) , and the first @xmath109 excited state ( @xmath198 ) for comparison of these states the construction of a basis for @xmath195 is sufficient .",
    "we can write these three states as    @xmath199    the difference between the @xmath106 yrast state and the first @xmath109 excited state lies exclusively in the bond between the last two particles : it is a triplet in the first case and a singlet in the second .",
    "up to first order , the energies of the states ( [ 3states ] ) are given by    @xmath200    without interactions , the latter two levels are degenerate and in first order they are on average splitted only by the exchange interaction favoring as usual the spatially antisymmetric triplet state . to calculate the average second order corrections , we need to know the number of direct interaction induced transitions which we will call the _ connectivity _ @xmath1 and which is calculated in detail in appendix",

    "this decrease of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath9 results in a smaller number of second order contributions for states in higher @xmath9 sectors and thus a smaller reduction of the energy of the corresponding yrast state .",
    "we will identify below the transitions which give the major contributions to the difference in second order shift between the two lowest yrast states .",

    "we will discuss this point below .",
    "the correction @xmath207 for the @xmath106 yrast can be calculated in the same way and one can show that differences between @xmath208 and @xmath207 occur first due to denominators differing by @xmath209 as transitions involving the two uppermost particles start from the orbitals @xmath210 and @xmath211 for @xmath109 and 1 respectively and second due to transitions either increasing or decreasing the number of double occupancies ( which only occur for @xmath212 ) . as noted ,",
    "the number of such transitions is @xmath36 and they give a contribution to the spin gap which can be written ( @xmath213 is the filling factor )    @xmath214    where @xmath215 is a numerical factor .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the energy difference we found in ( [ tip2nd]),([splitting ] ) except that @xmath216 has been replaced by @xmath217 .    while the term just calculated is easiest to identify , a more important contribution to the spin energy gap comes from a more subtle source .",
    "there is a certain class of transitions starting from the @xmath106 ground - state which have exactly the same energy denominator as the corresponding class in @xmath212 case ( see fig .",

    "does not change and one can show that the singlet and triplet terms in the hamiltonian induce transitions onto the same final state .",
    "correspondingly , the two transition amplitudes must be added coherently , and it turns out that this results in a reduced transition probability from @xmath218 down to @xmath219 ( a detailed calculation of the amplitude of these transitions is given in appendix a ) . the corresponding contribution to the spin gap",
    "can be estimated as    @xmath220    this result is valid in the dilute limit @xmath203 and this contribution dominates the spin gap as soon as the number of particles is sufficiently large , i.e. for @xmath221 .    as for @xmath133 it is straightforward to calculate the splitting induced by off - diagonal fluctuations between the @xmath106 yrast and the first excited @xmath109 state : there is no difference in the energy denominators and there is a one - to - one correspondence between all second order contributions for these two states , except for the transitions which do nt exist for @xmath106 . the latter correspond to scattering onto a double occupancy on the @xmath222 orbital , or from the @xmath223 onto a double occupancy on a previously empty orbital .",
    "these then are the only contributions to the average splitting , which takes the form    @xmath224    and is thus positive .",
    "we now briefly discuss the case of odd number of particles .",

    "consequently , the relative fluctuations will be dominated by the first ( second ) order for @xmath259 ( @xmath260 ) .",
    "these estimates neglect however the spectral fluctuations and are thus valid in the case of a rigid equidistant spectrum only .",
    "the variance of the gap distribution is however dominated by these spectral fluctuations ( which are proportional to the average level spacing @xmath10 ) for both wigner - dyson and poisson statistics as long as @xmath261 .",
    "in the regime of dominant fluctuations @xmath115 , all energy scales ( width of the mbdos , ground - state energy , gaps and splitting between eigenvalues ... ) become linear in the fluctuation strength @xmath2 .",
    "most of the properties of the hamiltonian can then be obtained by assuming @xmath262 , and for random interaction models of this form , the shape and width of the mbdos can be extracted from a computation of its variance and higher moments .",
    "we begin this chapter with a short overview of this method mostly developed in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath78 dominates , @xmath30 and @xmath94 may introduce a constant shift of the full mbdos due to the mean field charge - charge interaction , a shift of each sector s mbdos by an amount @xmath263 from the mean - field spin - spin exchange and a subdominant ( @xmath264 ) nonhomogeneous modification of the mbdos due to @xmath30 which is negligible in the limit considered here .",
    "we thus first consider the mbdos corresponding to @xmath78 and will introduce later on the only relevant mean - field contributions : the @xmath9-dependent shifts due to the exchange interaction .",
    "the average shape and width of the mbdos of @xmath70 can be extracted from its moments    @xmath265    where @xmath266 and @xmath72 refers to a slater determinant .",
    "taking the average of this expression , we easily see that only the even moments of the average mbdos do not vanish . in the last sum furthermore , only terms with pairs of indices occuring twice give a non - zero average contribution , i.e. to compute the moments , one needs to perform contractions over the hamiltonian operators such that    @xmath267    for a pair of indices @xmath268 .",
    "we can readily calculate the second moment , i.e. the variance of the mbdos    @xmath269    where we have taken care of the number of matrix elements and different variances of the three classes of hamiltonian matrix elements mentioned in chapter [ model ] .",
    "in the limit of large number of particles , equation ( [ variance ] ) explicitly expresses the dominance of generic two - body ime : since their number is given by @xmath270 , their contribution to @xmath271 goes parametrically like @xmath272 , whereas the contribution from one - body ime and diagonal matrix elements is @xmath273 and @xmath274 respectively .",
    "this motivates us to neglect the subdominant contributions to @xmath271 and to use the approximation    @xmath275    a calculation of the connectivity @xmath276 is given in appendix [ appendix2 ] .",
    "higher moments are also easily estimated in the dilute limit @xmath203 . in this case , the contractions ( [ contraction ] ) can be performed independently as the probability to create ( or destroy ) the same fermion on the same orbital is vanishingly small . this remains the case as long as the number of creation ( destruction ) operators in @xmath277 is smaller than the number of particles , i.e. for @xmath278 . a second condition @xmath279 must also be satisfied , for which creations and destructions statistically occur on different orbitals . in this case , higher moments are simply multiple of the second moment , with a combinatorial factor reflecting the number of different possible contractions    @xmath280    this relation defines a gaussian mbdos , and corrections occur only due to higher moments ( @xmath281 ) , mainly affect the tails of the distribution , and vanish in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "it is remarkable that the order of the moments which fail to behave like those of a gaussian distribution depends almost exclusively on the number of particles , at least as long as one restricts oneself to the lowest magnetization blocks away from full polarization .",
    "therefore , corrections affect each partial ( i.e. @xmath9-dependent , or block- ) mbdos in the same way , and we will assume that the relative parametric dependence of the bulk of the mbdos at different @xmath9 can be extrapolated to the tails .",
    "this means that , as in the case of a gaussian distribution , the knowledge of its variance fully determines the mbdos . for more details on the shape of the mbdos for random interaction models similar to ( [ hamran ] )",

    "based on these previous works @xcite establishing the quasi - gaussian shape of the mbdos , we can now derive a simple parametric expression for the average energy difference between yrast states in each magnetization block .",
    "indeed , the mbdos satisfy a scaling law    @xmath282    which allows to rescale all of them approximately on top of each other .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbdos ] which shows both the multiple gaussian structure of the mbdos and the scaling with @xmath283 obtained from numerical calculations for @xmath284 .",
    "the yrast states are distributed in the low energy tail of the partial mbdos , where the corrections due to higher moments are the largest .",
    "we have nevertheless seen above that these corrections affect each block s mbdos in the same way ( this is true only for not too large magnetizations ) .",
    "thus the tails undergo the same modification , say for @xmath109 and @xmath106 .",
    "if we then make the ( a priori not justified ) assumption that the yrast levels are uncorrelated , i.e. that for a given realization of @xmath78 their positions around their respective average value are not correlated , then we can conclude that the average distance between two yrast states is parametrically given by the difference of the width of the corresponding mbdos .",
    "assuming , as just discussed , that the tails of the distribution scale with the variance with a factor @xmath285 and neglecting contributions arising from @xmath286 , the typical spin gap can be estimated ( for @xmath287 ) as    @xmath288\\ ] ]    in fig .",

    "however the origin here is the fluctuating interaction and the energy differences scale as @xmath2 instead of @xmath10 .",
    "as in the perturbative regime discussed in the previous chapter , the occurence of this even - odd effect is due to the connectivity @xmath1 and from fig . [",
    "fig : gapinf ] we see that the probability for a magnetic ground - state is more strongly reduced for odd than for even number of particles also in the asymptotic regime .",
    "we next note that the gap first increases with increasing number of particles before it seems to stabilize above @xmath291 .",
    "we have checked ( dashed and dotted - dashed lined in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapinf ] ) that this behavior , which is not captured by the dilute estimate ( [ spingap ] ) , is partly due to the neglect in ( [ variance ] ) of nongeneric matrix elements with enhanced variance mentioned above .",
    "however , even though the exact variance gives a much better estimate , it still underestimates the gap at larger @xmath0 and we have numerically determined that this is due to a strong positive correlation of the ground state energies in adjoining spin blocks which is larger at large @xmath0 .",

    "yrast levels are then due to special realizations of the latter inside the blocks .",
    "these realizations are presumably not very different in blocks with consecutive magnetization which results in strong eigenvalues correlations .",

    "the arguments presented in this section are based on estimates for the average yrast energy in each sector extracted from the shape and width of the corresponding mbdos .",

    "it follows that the ground - state energy in each sector roughly satisfies @xmath295 in the asymptotic regime , whereas in the perturbative regime we found @xmath296 ( see equation ( [ pertnip0 ] ) ) . neglecting logarithmic corrections ( which arise due to the denominators in the second order of perturbation theory ) we arrive at the critical border between perturbative and asymptotic regime ( radius of convergence of the perturbation theory )",
    "@xmath297    equation ( [ bord ] ) indicates the breakdown of perturbation theory at a much smaller strength of the fluctuations of interaction than previously expected .",
    "this is due to the coherent addition of many small second order contributions for the perturbation expansion in the immediate vicinity of the ground - state .",
    "a more detailed study of this breakdown has been presented in reference @xcite .",

    "we can distinguish three regimes : ( @xmath335 ) at low disorder , the one - electron dynamics undergoes a crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime as the linear system size is increased beyond the elastic mean - free path @xmath336 . in the ballistic regime @xmath337 , wavefunctions are plane - waves . in this case , a hubbard interaction gives @xmath338 , since the @xmath339 \\sim l^{-4}$ ] and @xmath340 @xcite , whereas once the diffusive regime is reached , one expects @xmath341 @xcite .",

    "presumably these contributions still affect our data in region ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "( @xmath345 ) in the regime of intermediate disorder , both off - diagonal fluctuations and exchange are increased by disorder , and apparently they compensate each other , resulting in a @xmath343-independent @xmath346 , in 2d .",

    "we indeed numerically estimated the elastic mean free path at @xmath347 from the distribution of inverse participation ratio @xcite and found a value @xmath348 .",
    "the gaussian modes are thus weighted by a prefactor @xmath349 for @xmath331 and have therefore only a marginal influence on the fluctuations of the ime , so that one may reasonably assume that finite - size effects have only a marginal influence on the data presented in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note that the upper border of this intermediate regime is quite close to the critical disorder value for the anderson localization transition .",
    "( @xmath352 ) in the regime of strong disorder , one - particle wavefunctions are strongly localized on fewer and fewer sites , the off - diagonal fluctuations are sharply reduced ( due to quasi selection rules discussed in chapter [ model ] ) and again exchange dominates .",
    "note that eventually , the latter disappears also , but at a lower rate than the fluctuations .",
    "these results indicate that at an intermediate disorder strength , off - diagonal fluctuations may be strong enough to play an important role for the magnetization properties of the ground - state .",
    "we next evaluate the influence of the long - range part of the interaction .",
    "the average exchange interaction ( [ exchange ] ) term is given by an average taken over one - particle wavefunctions close to the fermi level .",
    "due to their orthogonality , taking this average over the full set of wavefunctions gives a @xmath353-function and only on - site contributions .",
    "this averaging procedure is however only justified if the one - body dynamics is described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) for which the structure of the eigenstates is homogeneous all through the spectrum .",
    "rmt however describes systems which are of interest here only inside an energy window given by the thouless energy around the fermi level @xcite so that the average over wavefunctions close to the fermi level leads only to a more or less sharply peaked function of @xmath354 .",
    "there are also contributions to the exchange from the long - range terms , but still we expect that the average damps them with respect to their contribution to off - diagonal fluctuations ( this damping of course depends on the disorder strength . ) which are of the same order of magnitude as the short - range contribution up to distances of the order of @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "this means that we expect a decrease of @xmath64 upon increase of the interaction range .",
    "the validity of this reasoning is illustrated for the two - dimensional case on fig .",

    "are induced by chaotic scattering at an irregular confining potential , standard estimates give @xmath355 for a short - range interaction , whereas in the ( unphysical ) limit of an infinite range interaction @xmath356 one gets @xmath357 @xcite . therefore , and as @xmath127 is not too large in such systems , it is a priori not justified to neglect the effect of off - diagonal fluctuations , as they should at least strongly suppress the probability of finding ground states of larger spin beyond few ( @xmath358 ) polarized electrons .",
    "it has even been proposed by blanter , mirlin and muzykantskii that in confined systems the accumulation of charge at the surface of confinement leads to stronger fluctuations of screened coulomb interaction matrix elements @xmath359 which would give @xmath360 . as in quantum dots",
    "@xmath127 is of the order of up to few tens , this would bring @xmath64 down to values where the demagnetizing effect of off - diagonal fluctuations plays an important role .",
    "all this illustrates the relevance of off - diagonal fluctuations for the magnetization properties of the ground - state in regimes of intermediate disorder and for poor screening of the electronic interactions - presumably , for low electronic densities @xmath361 for which the distance between electron is smaller than the elastic mean free path @xmath362 .",
    "assuming still @xmath363 , the shift of the stoner threshold is quite small , of the order @xmath364 .",
    "this is so , as the model we consider is valid only in an energy window of the order of the thouless energy @xmath126 around the fermi level , so that it is quite natural to set @xmath365 . at larger magnetization",
    "however , the second term in ( [ gapsigma ] ) takes over and induces a significant reduction of the ground - state spin when the latter becomes comparable to @xmath127 with a prefactor depending on the strength of the average exchange .",
    "this term strongly modifies the stoner scenario as it induces magnetization saturation above the magnetization threshold and full polarization can be achieved only once a second , significantly larger , threshold is reached .",
    "we finally describe an experimental setup that allows to gain important information on the ground - state spin of two - dimensional lateral quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the experiment was proposed in @xcite and consists in applying an external magnetic field in the plane of a lateral , two - dimensional quantum dot .",
    "because of the two - dimensional nature of the dynamics , we assume that an in - plane field has no orbital effect so that it introduces only a zeemann coupling @xcite .",

    "the resonant gate voltage is given by a difference of two many - body ground - state energies @xmath367 , and it is always the difference of an even - odd pair ( i.e. of ground state energies corresponding to one even and one odd number of electrons on the dot ) . upon application of an in - plane field , the peak position behaves like    @xmath368    @xmath369 is the magnetization difference between the two consecutive ground - states which can therefore be extracted experimentally from the motion of conductance peaks in an in - plane field . at minimal magnetization one",

    "as long as consecutive ground states never differ by more than one unit of spin the absolute value of the slope will remain constant as the system polarizes .",
    "correspondingly , if all slopes are constant @xmath374 , it is very likely that no ground - state is magnetized ( this would for instance require a sequence @xmath376 1/2 , 1 , 1/2 , 1 , 1/2 ... we do not see any obvious reason why _ all _ even @xmath0 ground - states should have @xmath377 while at the same time none of the odd @xmath0 ground - states are magnetized ) .",
    "however if there exist many magnetized ground states , then the probability to find pairs of consecutive ground - states with a larger difference in magnetization @xmath378 increases and one expects a range of slopes to occur .",
    "then the corresponding peak heights may be strongly reduced by the spin blockade mechanism @xcite , which should be easily visible experimentally .",
    "this argument neglects changes in the @xmath127-factor of the electron with changing @xmath0 , which presumably are slow .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : spindot ] where the peak positions are drawn as a function of the zeemann coupling for @xmath357 and 5 .",
    "it is clearly seen that at weak @xmath64 , @xmath379 is constant and corresponds to a minimal @xmath380 , while a larger @xmath64 gives different slopes in agreement with the above reasoning .",
    "note also in this latter case , that peaks evolve in parallel at weak magnetic field , indicating the successive addition of two spins oriented in the same direction .",
    "this feature is absent of the weak - exchange ( right - hand ) side of the graph for which the ground - states are obtained by piling up electrons on the orbitals according to the pauli prescription .",
    "this results in a minimal ground - state spin , a sequence @xmath373 of magnetization differences between consecutive ground - states and a motion of neighboring peaks in opposite direction at low field .",
    "recently , experiments in this direction have indeed been performed , which have given serious evidences for the occurence of partially ( but weakly ) magnetized ground - states with few polarized electrons @xcite .",
    "this means that the off - diagonal fluctuations are not dominant , in agreement with the above considerations giving a large ratio @xmath355 between the strength of the average exchange and the off - diagonal fluctuations .",
    "therefore the perturbative treatment presented in section [ pert ] is expected to correctly describe semiconductor quantum dots either in the diffusive regime ( large dots ) or in the ballistic regime with chaotic boundary scattering ( smaller dots ) .",
    "we note in this respect that from recent experiments on the distribution of conductance peak spacings , the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath2 have been tentatively extracted and seem to indicate a conductance @xmath381 for which off - diagonal fluctuations should give a non - negligible contribution @xcite .",
    "finally , we note another interesting experimental result which is the apparent absence of suppression of the conductance peak found in some cases for larger spin difference between consecutive ground - states @xcite .",
    "this is in major disagreement with the spin - blockade mechanism proposed by weinmann , hasler and kramer @xcite and is yet to be understood .",
    "in this article we have illustrated how fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements tend to reduce the ground - state magnetization , both when they can be treated perturbatively ( the regime which is relevant for condensed matter physics ) and in the asymptotic regime where they give the dominant terms in the hamiltonian ( which is relevant for nuclear physics ) .",
    "the mechanism behind this effect is in a way similar to the stoner picture where itinerant ferromagnetism occurs due to a larger number of diagonal interactions at low magnetization . as in a mean - field or self - consistent",
    "approach , each of these terms gives a positive contribution ( for a repulsive interaction ) , this directly favors spin polarization .",
    "similarly , we have shown that interactions induce more transitions in the low spin sectors .",
    "each of these transitions gives one contribution in second order perturbation theory which this time is however negative ( _ both for attractive and repulsive interactions _ ) if one considers the lowest level in each sector , and this therefore favors a low spin ground - state . in the perturbative regime",
    ", we have seen that these fluctuations induce two terms in an effective hamiltonian formalism : a @xmath382 term which simply induces a small shift of the stoner threshold and a second @xmath383-term which is switched on at larger magnetization where it results in a saturation of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a major qualitative modification of the stoner scenario : even neglecting discrepancies in the one - body density of states , full polarization is not achieved once ground - state magnetization has been triggered by the exchange interaction .",
    "the latter must indeed also overcome the @xmath384 term , which requires an even larger exchange .",
    "the strongest effect of off - diagonal fluctuations occurs in the large spin regime @xmath385 where a mean - field picture overestimates the value of the ground - state spin .    from the point of view of nuclear physics ,",
    "our analysis of the regime of large fluctuations , based on a study of the many - body density of states , clearly indicated a strong bias toward low angular momentum ground - state .",
    "we have not explained however why numerical results indicate an almost 100% predominance of @xmath109 ground - state for models similar to the one we have studied @xcite , and this question is still open .",
    "our findings should finally be put in perspective with the renormalization group ( rg ) treatment for disordered interacting electronic systems of finkelstein @xcite . in his approach ,",
    "one indeed finds that the rg flow renormalizes the ferromagnetic spin - spin coupling to larger and larger values , possibly indicating the occurence of a ferromagnetic phase due to the combined effect of disorder and interaction .",
    "the perturbative treatment we presented in section [ pert ] did not allow us to find any contribution favoring a higher spin and this apparent disagreement between the rg approaches and ours is at present not understood .",
    "we note however that it has been suggested that the divergence of the exchange coupling induced by the rg flow could indicate a crossover to the singlet - only universality class @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is worth noticing that the scattering processes in the singlet and triplet channels as defined in the present work have coupling constants corresponding to the sum and the difference of the couplings @xmath386 and @xmath387 as defined in @xcite respectively .",
    "it can be checked that the ratio @xmath388 satisfies the same rg equation as the exchange coupling ( @xmath389 in @xcite ) so that the triplet channel vanishes at the same rate as the ( ferromagnetic ) exchange flows to strong coupling , which may indicate a cancellation of the ferromagnetic instability by the effect studied in the present paper .",

    "@xmath395 is normalized and the factor @xmath396 appears in the case of an initial state with double occupancies for which the number of triplet transitions is reduced by a factor three ( without double occupancies , the three triplet operators in ( [ usrs ] ) are individually srs ) .",
    "thus the total transition _ probability _ is kept constant . finally , @xmath395 is orthogonal to @xmath397 , i.e. singlet and triplet channels give transitions onto orthogonal states .",
    "their contribution to second order perturbation theory will therefore add incoherently and give a transition probability            the label @xmath401 refers to either a triplet or a singlet @xmath92 two - particle state on the orbitals @xmath399 and @xmath285 .",
    "the transition amplitudes can be calculated in the same way for both cases , and we restrict ourselves below to the triplet case with @xmath402 .",
    "note that this latter state can be brought via a rotation in spin space onto the following @xmath377 state      and that the calculations to be presented below give the same transition amplitude for both @xmath402 and @xmath404 and are thus fully srs .",
    "acting on @xmath402 with a singlet interaction operator gives      which once again is srs .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , the above transition amplitude has picked up a factor @xmath165 with respect to the case where the initial state has two double occupancies .",
    "this is due to the vanishing of one transition `` channel '' , as the @xmath285 orbital is only singly occupied , and will result in a factor @xmath19 for the transition amplitude .",
    "note that this factor is counterbalanced by a twice larger number of transitions for the case considered here , as one has the freedom to destroy ( or create ) a particle on the @xmath406 or the @xmath407 orbital .",
    "secondly , doing the same calculation with a triplet operator acting on the singlet initial state @xmath402 is not srs per se , but once again requires to consider the @xmath107 triplet operators , as we did above for the case of two double occupancies .    only in the situation where both initial and final states correspond to partially occupied orbitals",
    "does one get an uncompensated reduction of the transition amplitude with respect to the above case of doubly occupied initial and empty final orbitals . as we are now going to show ,",
    "this results from the coherent addition of the triplet and singlet transitions which lead to the same final state .",
    "the initial state is e.g.              the result is srs , i.e. gives a four - particle final state with @xmath106 , @xmath92 .",
    "the key point here is that both singlet and triplet channels go to the same final state .",
    "thus one gets the corresponding second order transition probability by adding their amplitude coherently .",
    "the average transition probability reads then      the same contribution arises from the interchange @xmath412 in the operator ( [ op ] ) .",
    "the above transition probability comes therefore with a factor two .",
    "this is because once the particles are triplet ( or singlet ) paired on different orbitals , transitions become distinguishable .",
    "in addition , one has to consider the four @xmath106 transitions induced by ( @xmath413 )      which together give a transition probability @xmath415 .",
    "the total transition probability is then @xmath219 instead of @xmath218 in the case of doubly occupied initial and empty final orbitals ( [ res22 ] ) .",
    "the same result is obtained in the case of a singlet initial state      for which singlet and triplet transitions ( [ op ] ) and ( [ opst ] ) also add coherently , resulting in the same reduction of the transition amplitude ( [ tramplitude ] ) .",
    "consequently , and for @xmath234 , the splitting between the @xmath106 yrast and the first @xmath109 excited state is much smaller than the spin gap between the two lowest yrasts .",
    "note that these calculations must be modified in realistic systems for which @xmath417 does not necessary hold .",
    "for a purely local ( hubbard ) interaction with time - reversal symetry for instance , one has @xmath418 as the antisymetrized matrix elements vanish exactly .",
    "then , the reduction in transition probability occurs due to the vanishing of singlet transitions as one goes to larger magnetizations .",
    "we first calculate each sector s connectivity @xmath1 which is the number of basis states directly connected to an arbitrary initial many - body state of a given sector , alternatively the number of nonzero matrix elements per row ( or column ) of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "we saw in appendix a that some transitions have increased weights , in particular triplet transitions involving two doubly occupied orbitals pick up a factor @xmath396 that is absent of all other transitions . in absence of double occupancies however , these transitions are replaced by three times as many triplet transitions so that the total transition probability is conserved .",
    "the latter quantity is in fact the physically relevant one as it appears in second order perturbation theory and determines the scaling of the mbdos in the regime of dominant fluctuations .",
    "we therefore calculate the weighted connectivity , where the number of transitions are multiplied by the square of their relative amplitude . with this definition and for the case we are considering of spin @xmath19 particles ,",
    "the connectivity is constant within one sector . from ( [ usrs ] ) , @xmath1 is the sum of a singlet and a triplet channel contribution which differ only in that the former allows transition from and to double occupancies .",
    "for @xmath109 we may consider the @xmath185 ground - state as our initial state .",
    "it is easily seen then that the number of directly connected states can be expressed as a sum over four contributions @xmath419 which for @xmath109 are given by      the first term corresponds to trivial diagonal transitions , the second one to partially off - diagonal transitions changing a single one - body occupation , while the third and fourth ones correspond to generic two - body transitions induced respectively by the singlet and triplet interaction operators in ( [ usrs ] ) .",
    "note the discrepancy in the prefactor @xmath421 between @xmath422 and @xmath423 due to the enhancement of triplet transition amplitude discussed in appendix a. as @xmath9 increases , some singlet transitions are replaced by additional triplet transitions but some other disappear which we are going to identify .",
    "the connectivity at full polarization is also easily calculated as there are no long singlet transitions and particles may be considered spinless .",
    "one has @xmath424          for a finite magnetization , we may represent the lowest level in the sector as a sea of @xmath427 double occupancies separated from @xmath428 empty levels by a layer of @xmath429 singly occupied levels as depicted on fig.[fig : stlayer ] .",
    "the transitions included in ( [ connecst ] ) and that are now forbidden correspond to singlet transitions involving either initial or final states with at least one scattering particle in the @xmath429 layer .",
    "these transitions can be classified as : + 1 ) transitions from a double occupancy in the fermi sea onto the @xmath429-layer ( fig.[fig : scat ] ( a ) ) + 2 ) transitions from the @xmath429-layer onto a double occupancy in one of the @xmath428 empty levels ( fig.[fig : scat ] ( b ) ) + 3 ) one- and two - body transitions within the @xmath429-layer ( fig.[fig : scat ] ( c ) ) and + 4 ) two - body transitions from the @xmath429-layer , one of the particles being transferred to a new orbital in the @xmath429-layer , the other one onto one of the @xmath428 empty levels ( fig.[fig : scat ] ( d ) ) + a simple counting of the number of these transitions finally gives      which in particular correctly reproduces the difference ( [ test ] ) .",
    "it is easily checked ( e.g. from ( [ test ] ) that the ratio @xmath431 is a function of the filling factor @xmath432 only .",
    "also it is remarkable that the connectivity difference between @xmath109 and @xmath106 is @xmath36 for any number of particles .",
