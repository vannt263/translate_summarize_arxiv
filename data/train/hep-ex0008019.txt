    "thus , selection of events below the solid line effectively rejects events from both classes `` d '' and `` e '' . to estimate the number of remaining background events in class `` e '' , events of the process @xmath57 , @xmath56 were selected using the conditions @xmath61 and @xmath62 . then the efficiency @xmath63 of such a cut",

    "comparison of various experimental distributions with the simulation shows that the assumption of the @xmath92 mechanism does not contradict the data .",
    "the detection efficiency decreases with energy , smoothly varying from 30% to 27% .",
    "radiative corrections were calculated according to @xcite . since radiative corrections themselves depend on the energy behavior of the cross section , the calculation",
    "was performed by the iteration method .",
    "`` visible '' values of the cross section ( with @xmath93 in ( [ eq : xsec ] ) ) were used as the first approximation . then the cross section was recalculated with the new values of the radiative corrections and the whole procedure was repeated until the convergence was reached .",

    "three data samples were selected with an additional requirement for background suppression and variations of the criteria described in section [ sec : analysis ] :    1 .",
    "application of a stricter requirement on the impact parameter of each track @xmath95 cm suppresses @xmath96 80% of the background events from the reaction ( [ eq : kskl ] ) , leaving about 150 @xmath97 events in the @xmath10  data sample 2 .",

    "another source of the background is the reaction @xmath122 with the dalitz decay of one of the neutral pions . the main background , however , comes from the process ( [ eq : kskl ] ) followed by the @xmath123 and @xmath124 decays .    the same restrictions on the de / dx of the tracks as those applied in the search for the decay @xmath125 ( see fig .",
