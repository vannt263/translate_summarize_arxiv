    "extraordinary progress has been made in the last half - dozen years @xcite towards the goal of cooling a small mechanical resonator down to its quantum ground state and hence to realise quantum behavior in a macroscopic system .",
    "implementations include cavity cooling of micromirrors on cantilevers @xcite ; dielectric membranes in fabry - perot cavities @xcite ; radial and whispering gallery modes of optical microcavities @xcite and nano - electromechanical systems @xcite .",
    "indeed the realizations span 12 orders of magnitude in size @xcite , up to and including the ligo gravity wave experiments . in 2011 two separate experiments @xcite achieved sideband cooling of micromechanical and nanomechanical oscillators to the quantum ground state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , spectral signatures ( in the form of asymmetric displacement noise spectra ) of quantum ground state cooling were further investigated .",
    "corresponding advances in the theory of optomechanical cooling have also been made @xcite .",
    "over the last year or so , a promising new paradigm has been attracting much interest : several groups @xcite have now investigated schemes for optomechanical cooling of levitated dielectric particles , including nanospheres , microspheres and even viruses . the important advantage is the elimination of the mechanical support , a dominant source of environmental noise which can heat and decohere the system .    in general , these proposals involve two fields , one for trapping and one for cooling .",
    "this may involve an optical cavity mode plus a separate trap , or two optical cavity modes : the so - called `` self - trapping '' scenario .",
    "mechanical oscillators in the self - trapping regime differ from other optomechanically - cooled devices in a second fundamental respect ( in addition to the absence of mechanical support ) : the mechanical frequency , @xmath0 , associated with centre - of - mass oscillations is not an intrinsic feature of the resonator but is determined by the optical field .",
    "in particular , it is a function of one or both of the detuning frequencies , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of the optical modes . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we analysed cooling in the self - trapped regime and found that the optimal condition for cooling occurs where both fields competitively cool and trap the nanosphere .",
    "this happens when @xmath0 is resonantly red detuned from both the detuning frequencies i.e. @xmath6 so the relevant resonant frequencies are mutually interdependent .",
    "most significantly , the effective light - matter coupling strength @xmath1 also depends on the detunings .    the effective coupling strength , @xmath7 ( the optomechanical coupling rescaled by the square root of photon number ) determines whether one can attain strong coupling regimes in levitated systems such as recently observed in a non - levitated set - up @xcite .",
    "it determines too whether one may access other interesting dynamics , both in the semiclassical and quantum regimes .",
    "we consider in particular the possibility of simultaneous hybridization of the two optical modes with the mechanical mode ; here , we consider also the implications of a static bistability , which , unusually , occurs also in the limit of quite weak driving in the levitated self - trapped system .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate theoretically and experimentally the strength of the optomechanical coupling .",
    "in particular , we present experimental measurements of the mechanical frequency of a nanosphere trapped in an optical standing wave in order to investigate the optical coupling as a function of the size of the nanosphere .",
    "in section 1 we review the theory of the cavity cooling and dynamics of a self - trapped system , and in section 2 we employ the experimentally measured size dependence of the coupling to determine the range of optomechanical coupling strengths accessible in a cavity .",
    "the data suggests that the most effective means to attain stronger coupling will be to employ larger nanospheres of typical radii @xmath8 nm . our work suggests that increasing photon number by stronger driving ( and by implication increasing rescaled coupling strengths ) will not prove an effective alternative , since in the present system we show @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 , so the rescaled coupling increases very slowly with laser input power .    in section 3 ,",
    "we in investigate the cooling and dynamics . in sec .",
    "3.1 , we review the corresponding cooling rate expressions obtained from quantum perturbation theory ( or linear response theory ) . in sec .",
    "3.2 we report a study of the corresponding semiclassical langevin equations and compare them with fully quantum noise spectra ; we compare also quantum , semiclassical and perturbation theory results for levitated nanospheres . in section 4",
    "we investigate novel regimes of triple mode hybridization , coincident with static bistabilities , which the present study shows are experimentally accessible given the large optomechanical coupling strengths associated with @xmath11 nm nanospheres . in section 5",
    "we describe the experimental study which provides data from which the size - dependence of the coupling may be inferred . in section 6 , we conclude .",
    "we approximate the equivalent cavity model by a one - dimensional system , with centre - of - mass motion confined to the axial dimension . in this simplified study",
    ", we consider only the axial dynamics : for the cavity system , we will have a much smaller tranverse frequency relative to the axial frequency , i.e. @xmath12 and there is little mixing between these transverse and axial degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the following hamiltonian : @xmath13    two optical field modes of a high finesse cavity @xmath14 are coupled to a nanosphere with centre - of - mass position @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 ( dependent on the nanosphere polarizability ) , determines the depth of the optical standing - wave potentials .",
    "we investigate the case where both modes competitively cool and trap the nanosphere , in contrast to previous schemes @xcite where one optical field is exclusively responsible for trapping , while the other is exclusively responsible for cooling .",
    "@xmath17 is given in the rotating frame of the laser which drives the modes with amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , where @xmath20 represents the ratio of driving amplitudes for the two modes .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the regime @xmath21 , since we consider the most general case where both optical modes contribute to the trapping as well as the cooling .",
    "thus we can define mode 1 simply as the mode which is more strongly driven and mode 2 as the mode which is ( except where @xmath22 ) more weakly driven .",
    "the detunings @xmath23 for @xmath24 are between the input lasers and the corresponding cavity mode of interest , and @xmath25 represents the phases of the optical potentials .",
    "the two fields could represent two modes generated by the same laser field , or they could be generated by two independent lasers . nonetheless , since the particle motion is confined to within one wavelegth",
    ", one can make the approximation @xmath26 .",
    "previous studies generally consider @xmath27 to be convenient , since then the anti - node of one field coincides with a purely linear potential of the other optical field , but we may also consider general values of @xmath28 .",
    "one can write corresponding equations of motion :    @xmath29    where @xmath24 for the two optical - mode realisation .",
    "additional damping terms have also been added : @xmath30 accounts for photon losses due to mirror imperfections and the @xmath31 term for mechanical damping .",
    "the above should also include quantum noise terms arising from ( say ) shot noise or gas collisions : for brevity , the quantum noise terms are left out until sec.3 .",
    "we consider here the linearised dynamics ; we replace operators by their expectation values and perform the shifts about equilibrium values such as @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the values for the equilibrium photon fields ( e.g. for the two - mode case ) are @xmath34^{-1 } \\ $ ] and @xmath35^{-1}$ ] . the equilibrium position is then given by the relation @xmath36 , by numerical solution of the equation ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",
    "as usual we consider the dynamics of the fluctuations via the linearised equations . to first order , the linearised equations of motion , in the shifted frame , are :    @xmath39    the resulting effective mechanical harmonic oscillator frequency is :    @xmath40    we can restrict ourselves to real equilibrium fields . we take @xmath41 then transform @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 .",
    "we also rescale the mechanical oscillator coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the zero - point fluctuation length scale .",
    "hence , @xmath47 .",
    "+ below we drop the tilde so the equilibrium field values @xmath48 are real . using field operators",
    "@xmath49 , the linearised dynamics for a two - optical mode system would correspond to an effective hamiltonian :    @xmath50    .",
    "it is assumed that cavity parameters would correspond to @xmath51hz at @xmath52 nm , for photon numbers @xmath53 . for comparison ,",
    "the value of @xmath16 is also shown , as are the experimental and simulated frequencies @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath0 are scaled by a factor of 10 for clarity and in fact , values of @xmath55mhz are quite realistic in optical cavities.,height=316 ]",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ linham ] appears analogous in form to standard , well - studied optomechanical hamiltonians , albeit with two optical modes rather than one .",
    "however , it differs in one important respect : in this case , both the mechanical frequency @xmath56 and the optomechanical coupling strengths @xmath57 are not fixed and depend on the detunings . the fact that the frequencies of the three modes ( two optical , one mechanical ) are interdependent makes the dynamics different from other optomechanical set - ups , where the equilibrium mechanical frequency ( i.e. excluding shifts arising from the fluctuations ) is intrinsic to the mechanical oscillator .",
    "there is considerable interest in achieving strong - coupling , which leads to regimes of light - matter hybridization .",
    "the corresponding mode splitting has been observed experimentally @xcite . in typical set - ups , these regimes are reached if the rescaled effective optomechanical coupling exceeds the damping rates i.e. @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the cavity photon number .",
    "even if the unnormalized coupling is weak , strong - coupling regimes may be achieved by increasing the driving power and thus increasing intracavity photon numbers .    in the present levitated system ,",
    "a particularly interesting regime would involve triple - mode hybridization enabling , for example , the coupling of the two modes of light via the mechanical mode .",
    "however , here , mode hybridization ( for which @xmath60 ) depends non - trivially on the detunings .",
    "we argue that large coupling can not be easily achieved by increasing the driving power , since @xmath61 and thus increases slowly with the driving strength .",
    "we can show , by a simple argument , that increasing the nanosphere size provides the most effective means to attain strong coupling .    for the self - trapped system ,",
    "optomechanical coupling strengths are @xmath62 and depend on the detunings via @xmath63 .",
    "note also that @xmath64 here too depends on the detunings via @xmath0 .    for triple mode hybridization , @xmath65 . for convenience",
    ", we also take @xmath66 . then , since @xmath67 , we can re - write eq .",
    "[ freqs ] :    @xmath68    we consider near symmetric driving of the two optical modes for which @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 so @xmath71 .",
    "hence ,    @xmath72    since the optomechanical coupling increases only very slowly with cavity photon number the most effective means to reach strong coupling regimes is to increase the nanosphere size to the maximum practical value ( @xmath73 nm ) .",
    "for the ideal case where the nanosphere radius @xmath74 is small @xcite ie . @xmath75",
    ", then @xmath76 where the small nanosphere coupling takes the form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the sphere volume ( and hence @xmath79 where the density @xmath80kgm@xmath81 for silica ) . in turn",
    ", @xmath82 is the cavity volume , where @xmath83 m is the cavity waist and @xmath84 cm is the cavity length .    for larger nanospheres , the measured size - dependent corrections must be applied . in the experiments described below , we find that the mechanical oscillation frequency is modulated by a finite size correction @xmath85 ( see fig .  [ exp_trap_freq ] and description of the measurement of @xmath86 in section  5 below ) .",
    "thus , since : @xmath87    then @xmath88 and the coupling is in turn modulated by the finite size correction .",
    "the experimental results suggest that for @xmath89 nm , then @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for example , for @xmath52 nm , @xmath92 cm and @xmath93 m , then @xmath94hz . for reasonable values of cavity decay constants @xmath95hz , then for @xmath96 , @xmath97    for @xmath98 nm , @xmath99 .",
    "thus a 200 nm sphere provides an optomechanical coupling about an order of magnitude larger than a 40 - 50 nm sphere . to achieve a comparable increase in coupling by photon number enhancement",
    "would require increasing the driving power by a factor of order @xmath100 .    a more careful analysis , including the effects of the finite - size correction function @xmath101 is shown in fig .  [ beadg ] .",
    "we see that @xmath102 ( and for @xmath103 , also @xmath104 ) reaches a maximum value for @xmath105 nm before falling to zero . other maxima for larger @xmath74 do not provide a larger value of @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , they have the disadvantage that they may enhance photon recoil heating effects . for comparison ,",
    "the value of @xmath16 is also shown , overlaid on the experimental and simulated frequencies .",
    "a previous study @xcite , using rescaled coordinates , investigated the full parameter space of two optical mode cooling . here",
    "we investigate more carefully the effect of non - zero mechanical damping .",

    "for @xmath22 the map has a high degree of symmetry , since the role of the two optical modes is interchangeable .",

    "the power in each trapping beam after it has passed through each lens is measured to be @xmath213mw , and the best focused beam waist ( radius ) is theoretically 1.7@xmath214 m . to optimize the alignment of the trap , we maximize the light through - coupled from one fibre into the other .",
    "this is accomplished by mounting one optical fibre and its aspheric lens on an xyz flexure stage .",
    "the alignment is done inside the vacuum chamber at atmospheric pressure .",
    "a long working distance microscope ( navitar zoom 6000 system , with up to 45x zoom ) is used to image the trapped sphere .",
    "the image is split into two using a beamsplitting plate , with one image directed to a ccd camera for diagnostics and the other aligned onto a quadrant cell photodiode ( qpd ) which measures position fluctuations as a function of time in two orthogonal axes .",
    "we define the axial direction as that along which the trapping light propagates , and the transverse direction as the orthogonal axis in the focal plane of our imaging system .",
    "light at 532 nm is used to illuminate the trapped sphere , as the qpd is more sensitive at this wavelength .",
    "the green beam enters the system via one of the optical fibres , as shown in fig .",
    "[ trap ] , and a filter is used to stop 1064 nm light reaching the detectors .",

    "an image of a string of 100 nm diameter beads trapped in the standing wave trap .",
    "a single bead is trapped by continually blocking and unblocking one of the trapping beams until only one sphere is trapped . ]",
    "silica ( sio@xmath215 ) nanospheres , manufactured by microspheres - nanospheres and bangs laboratories , are introduced into the trapping region at atmospheric pressure via an ultrasonic nebulizer ( omron ne - u22 ) .",
    "these spheres range in radius from 26 nm to 510 nm and are suspended in methanol .",
    "the nanosphere solution is sonicated using an ultrasonic bath for at least an hour before trapping to prevent clumping . once introduced into the trapping region",
    "the methanol surrounding the spheres rapidly evaporates and the spheres are trapped over many fringes of the standing wave , as shown in fig .",
    "[ beads ] .",
    "as our imaging system does not have single fringe resolution we can not determine if more than one sphere is trapped in a single fringe by this method .",
    "however , this information can be inferred from the relative intensity of the light scattered from the trapped spheres and also by the reduced stability of the particles in the trap when more than one particle is trapped . to reduce the number of trapped particles the trapping light",
    "is briefly blocked and unblocked .",
    "this is repeated until a single sphere is visible in the trap . at this pressure , where there is a strong damping force from air the sphere can be held in the trap indefinitely .    to measure the trap frequency",
    "the air is pumped from the system , and at this point no more spheres enter the trap , as without air - damping their velocity is too high .",
    "the air pressure in the trap is reduced to 5 mbar , so that clear trap frequencies can be obtained from the power spectrum of the position fluctuations of the trapped sphere , as recorded on the qpd .",
    "example power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fft ] . above 5 mbar",
    "the damping of the motion in the trap due to air broadens the peak in the power spectrum so that finding an accurate trap frequency is difficult . below pressures of 5 mbar",
    "the spheres become unstable in the trap and escape .",
    "this is most likely due to radiometric forces which have been compensated for in other experiments using feedback techniques @xcite . at 5 mbar",
    "the damping rate due to gas collisions is significantly less than our lowest measured trap frequencies , and thus the measured frequency at this pressure is a good approximation to the bare trap frequency which would be measured in vacuum without damping .",
    "the angular axial trap frequency for a small polarizable particle in a standing wave is @xmath216 , where the polarizability of a sphere of refractive index @xmath113 is @xmath217 .",
    "the maximum intensity in the radial center of each equal intensity beam is given by @xmath218 , and @xmath219 is the magnitude of the wavevector of each beam .",
    "the sphere has mass @xmath220 , radius @xmath74 and density @xmath221kgm@xmath81 .",
    "the transverse trap frequency is given by @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the focused spot size ( radius ) of the two counter - propagating beams . from these expressions",
    "the ratio of the trap frequencies is given by @xmath224 .",
    "the trap frequencies in each axis are determined by fitting measured position fluctuation power spectra using @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath227 is the damping rate .",
    "the fit to the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fft ] with @xmath228khz for the axial trap frequency .",
    "several sets of data were taken for different spheres of the same nominal radius and the measured axial and transverse trap frequencies for each size sphere are shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_trap_freq ] .",
    "the derived trap frequencies for each sphere radius are the average over different experiments at each radius , and the errors are the standard errors in the mean .",
    "the uncertainty in the sphere radius is taken from the information supplied by the manufacturer .",
    "two axial ( red and green data in fig .",
    "[ exp_trap_freq ] ) frequencies and one transverse frequency ( blue data points ) were measured .",
    "when a particle is tightly trapped by the optical field only one axial frequency is expected from a single sphere in a standing wave . the lower axial frequency ( in green in figure  [ exp_trap_freq ] ) is always observed in the data and this is taken as the true axial frequency .",
    "the higher frequency , which is often present in the data , may be due to the trapping of two spheres in a single anti - node , with the higher frequency occurring due to optical binding , which requires further study @xcite .",
    "the higher axial frequency also changes rapidly with sphere size , indicating that it is not the true axial trap frequency , which should be almost constant for the small spheres .",
    "the presence of a single axial frequency is , we believe indicitave of having trapped a single sphere .    although we do nt know the radial dimensions of the beam within the trap we can estimate this value from the ratio of the axial to transverse trap frequencies for small spheres",
    "the spot size from this ratio is @xmath229 and for @xmath230=9.8 this gives a spot size of @xmath231 m . since the trap frequency with two overlapping beams of size 2.3@xmath214 m would be equal to 207khz with a power in each beam of 150mw , and we only measure a maximum axial trap frequency of approximately 40 khz , we conclude that the particles are trapped in a standing wave formed where the waist of one beam is much larger .",
    "if one spot size is 2.3@xmath214 m the other would have to be 15@xmath214 m .",
    "a plot of the calculated axial trapping frequency , found by calculating maxwell s stress tensor ( @xcite ) , is also shown in fig .  [ exp_trap_freq ] . like the experimental data the trapping frequency is constant for small spheres and decreases to approximately zero when the particle size is comparable to the size of the interference pattern produced by the standing wave . at larger",
    "radii the force on the particle changes sign and a stable trap is formed in a node of the standing wave , as shown for the particle of radius 510 nm .",
    "our measurements confirm that for particle radii less that 200 nm the simple dipole model for the nanospheres is adequate for modelling the cooling and dynamics of the nanospheres in an optical cavity utilising 1064 nm radiation .",
    "our experiments have shown that optical traps without feedback are currently limited to operation at pressures down to a few millibar for all particles that we have measured .",
    "in addition this limiting pressure did not change by reducing the intensity by 50% .",
    "this radiometric force is due to localized heating of nanosphere and the subsequent heating of the surrounding air . at low pressures , when the mean free path is comparable to the size of the nanosphere , the radiometric force competes with and eventually dominates the dipole force which traps the particle .",
    "while feedback techniques have been successful @xcite , decreasing the absorption of the nanospheres is another route to minimising radiometric effects .",
    "this is feasible since all the spheres we have used in this study are not made of optical quality glass but from colloidally grown nanospheres .",
    "finally , we have also successfully trapped silica spheres in an ion trap at pressures of @xmath185 mbar which could be used to load an optical trap formed by a cavity at lower pressures where radiometric forces are not significant .",
    "we have described a study of the dynamics and noise spectra of self - trapped levitated optomechanical systems .",
    "we have been able to show , by combining experimental measurements and theoretical calculations that strong light - matter coupling is attainable over a wide range of particle sizes , and that these can be trapped .",
    "the interdependence of the mechanical and optical mode frequencies , unique to self - trapped levitated systems provides a complex and interesting side - band structure , including multi - mode mixing and bistabilities which we aim to explore experimentally .",
    "these conclusions are supported by measurements of trap frequency made in an optical standing trap where we have demonstrated a protocol for loading a single nanosphere in a single antinode .",
