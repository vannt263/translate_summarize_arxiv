    "machine learning is the study and construction of systems that can learn from data .",
    "the systems are called _ learning machines_. when big data emerges increasingly , more learning machines are developed and applied in different domains . however , the ultimate goal of machine learning study is _ insight _ , not machine itself . by the term insight",
    "i mean _ learning mechanisms _ in descriptions of mathematical principles . in a loose sense",
    ", learning mechanisms can be regarded as the natural entity . as the _  tao _",
    "utf8bsmi (  )     reflects the most fundamental of the universe by lao tzu    utf8bsmi( )    , einstein suggests that we should pursue the simplest mathematical interpretations to the nature .",
    "although learning mechanisms are related to the subjects of psychology , cognitive and brain science , this paper stresses on the exploration of mathematical principles for interpretation of learning mechanisms . up to now , we human beings are still far away from deep understanding ourself on learning mechanisms in terms of mathematical principles .",
    "it is the author s belief that _ `` mathematical - principle - based machine '' _ might be more important and critical than",
    "_ `` brain - inspired machine '' _ in the study of machine learning .",
    "the purpose of this position paper is to put forward a new perspective and a novel conjecture within the study of machine learning . in",
    "what follows i will present four basic problems ( or levels ) in machine learning .",
    "the study on information theoretical learning is briefly reviewed .",
    "a theorem between the empirically - defined similarity measures and information measures are given .",
    "based on the existing investigations , a conjecture is proposed in this paper .",
    "for information processing by a machine , in the 1980 s , marr @xcite proposed a novel methodology by three distinct yet complementary levels , namely , _",
    "`` computational theory '' _ , _ `` representation and algorithm '' _ , and _",
    "`` hardware implementation '' _ , respectively .",
    "although the three levels are _ `` coupled '' _ loosely , the distinction is of great necessity to isolate and solve problems properly and efficiently . in 2007",
    ", poggio @xcite described another set of three levels on learning , namely , _",
    "`` learning theory and algorithms '' _ , _ `` engineering applications '' _ , and _ `` neuroscience : models and experiments '' _ , respectively . in",
    "apart from showing a new perspective , one of important contributions of this methodology is on adding a _ closed loop _ between the levels .",
    "these studies are enlightening because they show that complex objects or systems should be addressed by decompositions with different , yet basic , problems .",
    "the methodology is considered to be _ reductionism _ philosophically .    in this paper , i propose a novel perspective on machine learning by four levels shown in fig .",
    "the levels correspond to four basic problems .",
    "the definition of each level is given below .",
    "* definition 1 : * _ `` what to learn '' _ is a study on identifying learning target(s ) to the given problem(s ) , which will generally involve two distinct sets of representations ( fig .",
    "2 ) defined below .    *",
    "definition 1a : * _ `` linguistic representation '' _ reflects a _ high - level _ description in a _ natural language _ about the expected learning information .",
    "this study is more related to linguistics , psychology , and cognitive science .    *",
    "definition 1b : * _ `` computational representation '' _ is to define the expected learning information based on _",
    "mathematical notations_. it is relatively a _ low - level _ representation which generally includes objective functions , constraints , and optimization formations .    *",
    "definition 2 : * _ `` how to learn ? '' _ is a study on learning process design and implementations .",
    "probability , statistics , utility , optimization , and computational theories will be the central subjects .",
    "the main concerns are generalization performance , robustness , model complexity , computational complexity / cost , etc .",
    "the study may include physically realized system(s ) .",
    "* definition 3 : * _ `` what to evaluate ? '' _ is a study on _ `` evaluation measure selection '' _ where evaluation measure is a mathematical function",
    ". this function can be the same or different with the objective function defined in the first level .",
    "* definition 4 : * _ `` what to adjust ? '' _ is a study on dynamic behaviors of a machine from adjusting its component(s ) .",
    "this level will enable a machine with a functionality of _ `` evolution of intelligence''_.    the first level is also called _",
    "`` learning target selection''_. the four levels above are neither mutually exclusive , nor collectively exhaustive to every problems in machine learning .",
    "we call them _ basic _ so that the extra problems can be merged within one of levels . figs . 1 and 2",
    "illustrate the relations between each level in different contexts , respectively .",
    "the problems within four levels are all inter - related , particularly for _ `` what to learn ? '' _ and _ `` what to evaluate ? '' _ ( fig .",
    "`` how to learn ? ''",
    "_ may influence to _ `` what to learn ? '' _ , such as convexity of the objective function or scalability to learning algorithms @xcite from a computational cost consideration .",
    "structurally , _ `` what to adjust ? '' _ level is applied to provide the multiple closed loops for describing the interrelations ( fig .",
    "1 ) . artificial intelligence will play a critical role via this level . in the _  knowledge driven and data driven  _",
    "model @xcite , the benefits of utilizing this level are shown from the given examples by _ removable singularity hypothesis _ to _ `` sinc '' _ function and _ prior updating _ to mackey - glass dataset , respectively . philosophically , _",
    "`` what to adjust ? '' _ level remedies the intrinsic problems in the methodology of _ reductionism _ and offers the functionality power for being _",
    "holism_. however , this level receives even less attention while learning process holds a _ self organization _ property .",
    "i expect that the four levels show a novel perspective about the basic problems in machine learning .",
    "take an example shown in fig .",
    "3 [ after duda , et al , @xcite , fig . 5 - 17 ] . even for the linearly separable dataset ,",
    "the learning function using least mean square ( * lms * ) does not guarantee a _",
    "`` minimum - error '' _ classification .",
    "this example demonstrates two points .",
    "first , the computational representation of lms is not compatible with the linguistic representation of _ `` minimum - error '' _ classification .",
    "second , whenever a learning target is wrong in the computational representation , one is unable to reach the goal from levels 2 and 3 .",
    "another example in fig .",
    "4 shows why we need two sub - levels in learning target selection .",
    "for the given character ( here is _ albert einstein _ ) , one does need a linguistic representation to describe  ( _ un_)_likeness  _ @xcite between the original image and caricature image .",
    "only when a linguistic representation is well defined , is a computational measure of similarity _ possibly proper _ in caricature learning .",
    "the meaning of _ possibly proper _ is due to the difficulty in the following definition .    *",
    "definition 5 : * _ `` semantic gap '' _ is a difference between the two sets of representations .",
    "the gap can be linked by two ways , namely , a _ direct way _ for describing a connection from linguistic representation to computational representation , and an _ inverse way _ for a connection opposite to the direct one .    in this paper ,",
    "i extend the definition of the gap in @xcite by distinguishing two ways .",
    "the gap reflects one of the critical difficulties in machine learning .",
    "for the direct - way study , the difficulty source mostly comes from _ ambiguity _ and _ subjectivity _ of the linguistic representation ( say , on _ mental _ entity ) , which will lead to an _ ill - defined _ problem . while sharing the same problem , an inverse - way study will introduce an extra challenge called _ ill - posed _",
    "problem , in which there is no _ unique _ solution ( say , from a 2d image to 3d objects ) .    up to now",
    ", we have missed much studies on _ learning target selection _ if comparing with a study of _ feature selection_. when _ `` what to learn ? '' _ is the most primary problem in machine learning , we do need a systematic , or comparative , study on this subject .",
    "the investigations from @xcite into _ discriminative _ and _ generative _ models confirm the importance of learning target selection in the vein of computational representation .",
    "from the investigations , one can identify the advantages and disadvantages of each model for applications . a better machine gaining the benefits from both models",
    "is developed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the subject of _ `` what to learn ? '' _ will provide a strong driving force to machine learning study in seeking _",
    "`` the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes '' _ @xcite .",
    "take a decision rule about _ `` less costs more''_[multiblock footnote omitted ] for example .",
    "generally , chinese people classify object s values according to this rule . in _ big data _ processing , the useful information , that often belongs to a _ minority class _ , is extracted from massive datasets .",
    "while an english idiom describes it as _ `` finding a needle in a haystack '' _ , the chinese saying refers to _  searching a needle in a sea _ (    utf8bsmi )     .",
    "users may consider that an error from a _ minority class _ will cost heavier than that from a _ majority class _ in their searching practices .",
    "this consideration will derive a decision rule like _",
    "`` less costs more '' _",
    ". the rule will be one of the important strategies in big data processing .",
    "two questions can be given to the example .",
    "what is the _ mathematical principle _ ( or _ fundamental law _ ) for supporting the decision rule of _ `` less costs more '' _ ?",
    "is it a bayesian rule ?",
    "machine learning study does need to answer the questions .",
    "shannon introduced _ `` entropy '' _ concept as the basis of information theory @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a discrete random variable with _ probability mass function _ @xmath2 .",
    "entropy is an expression of _ disorder _ to the information . from this basic concept , the other _ information measures _ ( or _ entropy functions _ ) can be formed ( table 1 ) , where @xmath3 is the _ joint distribution _ for the target random variable @xmath4 and prediction random variable @xmath1 , and @xmath5 and @xmath2 are called _ marginal distributions_.",
    "we call them _ measures _ because some of them do not satisfy the _",
    "metric _ properties fully , like @xmath6 _ divergence _ ( asymmetric ) .",
    "more other measures from information theory can be listed as learning criteria , but the measures in table 1 are more common and sufficiently meaningful for the present discussion .",
    ".some information formulas and their properties as learning measures . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can divid the learning machines , in view of _ `` mathematical principles '' _ , within two groups .",
    "one group is designed based on the empirical formulas , like _",
    "error rate _ or _ bound _",
    ", _ cost _ ( or _ risk _ ) , _ utility _ , or _ classification margins_. the other is on information theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , a systematic study seems necessary to answer the two basic questions below @xcite :    1 .",
    "when one of the principal tasks in machine learning is to process data , can we apply entropy or information measures as a generic learning target for dealing with uncertainty of data in machine learning ?",
    "2 .   what are the relations between information learning criteria and empirical learning criteria , and the advantages and limitations in using information learning criteria ?    regarding to the first question , watanabe @xcite proposed that _",
    "`` learning is an entropy - decreasing process '' _ and pattern recognition is _ `` a quest for minimum entropy''_. the principle behind entropy criteria is to transform disordered data into ordered one ( or _ pattern _ ) .",
    "watanabe seems to be the first _",
    "`` to cast the problems of learning in terms of minimizing properly defined entropy functions '' _ @xcite , and throws a brilliant light on the learning target selection in machine learning .    in 1988",
    ", zellner theoretically proved that bayesian theorem can be derived from the optimal information processing rule @xcite .",
    "this study presents a novel , yet important , finding that bayesian theory is rooted on information and optimization concepts .",
    "another significant contribution is given by principe and his collaborators @xcite for the proposal of information theoretical learning ( * itl * ) as a generic learning target in machine learning .",
    "we consider itl will stimulate us to develop new learning machines as well as _",
    "`` theoretical interpretations '' _ of learning mechanisms .",
    "take again the example of the decision rule about _ `` less costs more''_. hu @xcite demonstrates theoretically that bayesian principle is unable to support the rule .",
    "when a minority class approximates to a zero population , bayesian classifiers will tend to misclassify the minority class completely .",
    "the numerical studies @xcite show that _ mutual information _ provides positive examples to the rule .",
    "the classifiers based on _ mutual information _ are able to protect a minority class and automatically balance the error types and reject types in terms of population ratios of classes .",
    "theses studies reveal a possible mathematical interpretation of learning mechanism behind the rule .",
    "when mutual information describes similarity between two variables , the other information measures in table 1 are applied in a sense of dissimilarity . for a better understanding of them ,",
    "their graphic relations are shown in fig .",
    "if we consider the variable @xmath4 provides a ground truth statistically ( that is , @xmath7 with the _ population rate _",
    "@xmath8 is known and fixed ) , its entropy @xmath9 will be the baseline in learning . in other words ,",
    "when the following relations hold ,    @xmath10    we call the measures _ reach _ the baseline of @xmath9 .    based on the study in @xcite ,",
    "further relations are illustrated in fig .",
    "6 between exact classifications and the information measures .",
    "we apply the notations of @xmath11 for the _ error , reject , accuracy , and correct recognition rates _ , respectively .",
    "their relations are given by : @xmath12 the form of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "6 describes an equality between the label variables in every samples . for a finite dataset",
    ", the empirical forms should be used for representing the distributions and measures @xcite .",
    "note that the link using `` @xmath14 '' indicates a _ two - way _ connection for equivalent relations , and `` @xmath15 '' for a _ one - way _ connection .",
    "three important aspects can be observed from fig . 6 :    * the _ necessary _ condition of exact classifications is that all the information measures reach the baseline of @xmath9 . *",
    "when an information measure reaches the baseline of @xmath9 , it does not _ sufficiently _ indicate an exact classification .",
    "* the different locations of one - way connections result in the interpretations _",
    "why _ and _ where _ the sufficient condition exists .",
    "although fig .",
    "6 only shows the relations to the information measures listed in table 1 for the classification problems , its observations may extend to other information measures as well as to the other problems , like clustering , feature selection / extraction , image registrations , etc .",
    "when we consider machine learning or pattern recognition to be a process of data in a _ similarity _ sense ( any dissimilarity measure can be transformed into similarity one @xcite ) , one important theorem exists to describe their relations .",
    "* theorem 1*. generally , there is no _ one - to - one _ correspondence between the empirically - defined similarity measures and information measures .    the proof is neglected in this paper , but it can be given based on the study of bounds between entropy and error ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the significance of theorem 1 implies that an optimization of information measure may not guarantee to achieve an optimization of the empirically - defined similarity measure .",
    "machine learning can be exploited with different perspectives depending on study goals of researchers . for a deep understanding of ourself on the learning mechanisms",
    "mathematically , we can take learning machines as _",
    "human s extended sensory perception_. this paper stresses on identifying the primary problem in machine learning from a novel perspective .",
    "i define it as _ `` what to learn ? '' _ or _",
    "`` learning target selection''_. furthermore , two sets of representations are specified , namely , _",
    "`` linguistic representation '' _ and _ `` computational representation''_. while a wide variety of computational representations have been reported in learning targets , we can argue that if there exists a unified , yet fundamental , principle behind them . towards this purpose",
    ", this paper extends the watanabe s proposal @xcite and the studies from zellner @xcite and principe @xcite to a _",
    "`` conjecture of learning target selection '' _ in the following descriptions .",
    "* conjecture 1*. in a machine learning study , all computational representations of learning target(s ) can be interpreted , or described , by optimization of entropy function(s ) .",
