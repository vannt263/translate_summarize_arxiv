    "transmission through multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas , or the so - called multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technology , is known as an efficient means for providing enormous information rates in rich - scattering mobile environments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "characterization of the fading mimo channel capacity limits , under various assumptions on the transmitter - side and receiver - side channel - state information ( csi ) and channel - distribution information ( cdi ) , has motivated a great deal of valuable scholarly work ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the case where the csi is perfectly _ known _ at the receiver but _ unknown _ at the transmitter has drawn much interest due to its validity in many practical situations .",
    "this is because the presumption of perfect receiver - side csi is usually reasonable for wireless channels where the receiver can locally estimate the fading channel , while the complete csi feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is difficult or even impossible .",
    "consequently , many schemes that exploit various forms of _ partial _ channel feedback have been proposed in literature . among others , the _ transmit - covariance feedback _ scheme is known to be capable of achieving data rates close to the fading mimo channel ergodic capacity when the channel cdi exhibits some long - term consistent statistical properties , e.g. , constant channel mean and/or constant channel covariance matrix @xcite-@xcite . in the transmit - covariance feedback scheme ,",
    "the receiver determines the transmit signal covariance matrix based on the cdi , and then sends it back to the transmitter through a feedback channel . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the feedback transmit covariance matrix for optimizing the channel ergodic capacity , and the conditions under which the beamforming  the transmit covariance matrix has rank one  is optimal , have been established for the single - user fading channel . in this scheme ,",
    "the transmit covariance matrix is fixed as long as the cdi is not changed .",
    "therefore , this scheme requires much less feedback complexity and is also more robust to the delay of the feedback channel compared to other partial channel feedback schemes based on the instantaneous mimo channel realizations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this paper considers the fading mac with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the receiver , and assumes that the csi from each mobile terminal ( mt ) to the base station ( bs ) is unknown at each mt transmitter , but is perfectly known at the bs receiver .",
    "thus , the bs can acquire the channel cdi for each mt .",
    "this paper extends the transmit - covariance feedback scheme for the single - user fading mimo channel to the fading mimo multiple - access channel ( mimo - mac ) where multiple antennas are used by the bs and possibly by each mt .",
    "two multiple - access techniques are considered for scheduling transmissions from each mt to the bs at the same frequency : _ space - division multiple - access _ ( sdma ) and _ time - division multiple - access _ ( tdma ) . for sdma ,",
    "all mts transmit simultaneously to the bs and their individual signals are decoded jointly at the bs while for tdma , each mt transmits independently to the bs during mutually orthogonal time slots and thus only single - user decoding is needed .",
    "the multiuser transmit - covariance feedback scheme is then described as follows . for sdma ,",
    "the bs first jointly optimizes the transmit signal covariance matrices for all mts , based on the multiuser cdi as well as the rate requirement and the power budget of each mt , and then sends them back to each mt for transmission .",
    "this scheme has also been considered in @xcite , @xcite for characterizing the capacity region and establishing the conditions for the optimality of beamforming for the fading mimo - mac , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for tdma , the bs jointly optimizes the duration of transmission time slot for each mt along with their transmit covariance matrices .",
    "these optimized values are then sent back to each corresponding mt via the feedback channel .",
    "this paper studies the information - theoretic limits of the fading mimo - mac under the multiuser transmit - covariance feedback scheme when either sdma or tdma is employed .",
    "two commonly adopted means to measure the information - theoretic limits of multiuser channels are the _ capacity region _ and the _ power region_. the capacity region is defined as the constitution of all achievable rate - tuples for the users given their individual power constraints , while the power region consists of all possible power - tuples for the users under which a given rate - tuple is achievable . this paper",
    "is mainly concerned with the characterization of the multiuser power region .",
    "our motivations are justified as follows :    first , characterization of the power region for the fading mimo - mac is a challenging problem .",
    "considering initially the case of sdma , the capacity region of a _ deterministic _ ( no fading ) gaussian mac with a single transmit and a single receive antenna ( siso - mac ) has the well - known _ polymatroid _ structure @xcite , which also holds for the fading mimo - mac . on the other hand , the power region of a _",
    "deterministic _ siso - mac is known to have a _ contra - polymatroid _ structure @xcite .",
    "the polymatroid and the contra - polymatroid structures can be utilized to reduce significantly the computational complexity of finding the boundary points of the capacity region and the power region , respectively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the contra - polymatroid structure is non - existent for the power region when the channel exhibits fading @xcite and/or the bs uses multiple antennas @xcite .. ] as a result , characterization of the power region for the fading mimo - mac under sdma is yet fully understood in literature . on the other hand , for tdma ,",
    "given the duration of each mt transmission time slot ( e.g. , equal time - slot durations for all mts in the conventional tdma ) , the bs only needs to optimize the transmit covariance matrices for the mts independently such that their individual transmission powers are minimized for supporting their own target rates .",
    "however , with time - slot duration adjustment for each mt , the bs now needs to consider the more challenging problem of jointly optimizing the time - slot durations and the transmit covariance matrices for all mts .",
    "this joint optimization has been less studied in literature .",
    "secondly , characterization of the power region can potentially provide very useful insights on the resource allocation problem for wireless networks , e.g. , the wireless cellular network .",
    "in many practical situations , each bs in the cellular network controls the transmit power of each mt in its cell such that each individual mt rate demand  transmission quality - of - service ( qos )  is satisfied ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "power control can be beneficial in many aspects , e.g. , to maintain fair power consumption among mts , to tailor for each mt s peak - power constraint , and to mitigate the co - channel interference between multiple cells operating at the same frequency . by exploiting the multiuser power region , the minimum power consumption in the network",
    "can be achieved under practical transmission constraints .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * for both sdma and tdma , the paper presents efficient algorithms for characterizing each boundary point of the power region for the fading mimo - mac .",
    "the developed algorithms are based on a lagrange primal - dual approach that exploits a novel dual relationship between the power region and the corresponding capacity region for the fading mimo - mac . for sdma ,",
    "the proposed algorithm determines jointly the optimal transmit covariance matrices for all mts as well as their optimal decoding order at the receiver . for tdma ,",
    "all mt transmit covariance matrices along with their assigned variable time - slot durations are jointly optimized . *",
    "in addition to the conventional way to characterize the boundary of the power region by solving a sequence of user _ weighted _ sum - power minimization problems subject to fixed user rate constraints , this paper proposes an alternative means for such characterization by considering the user sum - power minimization problem under different _ user power - profile _",
    "constraints , where the user power - profile regulates the power consumption of users under some given proportional fairness .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "alternatively , the connection between the power - tuple @xmath72 on the boundary of the power region and the target rate @xmath71 can be established by employing the capacity region concept .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with the fading multiple - input multiple - output multiple - access channel ( mimo - mac ) with multiple receive antennas at the base station ( bs ) and multiple transmit antennas at each mobile terminal ( mt ) . </S>",
    "<S> two multiple - access techniques are considered for scheduling transmissions from each mt to the bs at the same frequency , which are _ space - division multiple - access _ ( sdma ) and _ time - division multiple - access _ ( tdma ) . for sdma , </S>",
    "<S> all mts transmit simultaneously to the bs and their individual signals are resolved at the bs via multiple receive antennas while for tdma , each mt transmits independently to the bs during mutually orthogonal time slots . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the channel - state information ( csi ) of the fading channel from each mt to the bs is _ unknown _ at each mt transmitter , but is perfectly _ known _ at the bs receiver . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the bs can acquire the long - term channel - distribution information ( cdi ) for each mt . </S>",
    "<S> this paper extends the well - known _ transmit - covariance feedback _ scheme for the point - to - point fading mimo channel to the fading mimo - mac , whereby the bs jointly optimizes the transmit signal covariance matrices for all mts based on their cdi , and then sends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding mt via a feedback channel . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this paper is to characterize the so - called _ multiuser power region _ under the multiuser transmit - covariance feedback scheme for both sdma and tdma . </S>",
    "<S> the power region is defined as the constitution of all user transmit power - tuples that can achieve reliable transmissions for a given set of user target rates . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that sdma can achieve substantial power savings over tdma for the fading mimo - mac , even when the number of antennas at the bs is equal to that at each mt . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this paper demonstrates the usefulness of the multiuser power region for maintaining _ proportionally - fair _ power consumption among the mts .    </S>",
