    "thanks to the practical realization of hardware aberration correction ( ac ) , the point resolution of high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) is not limited by the positive spherical aberration ( @xmath1 ) any longer  @xcite , and materials can now be routinely imaged at atomic resoultion with state - of - the - art instruments even at low acceleration voltages  @xcite .",
    "once the strong @xmath1 contribution is removed , other aberrations such as three - fold astigmatism ( @xmath2 ) and coma ( @xmath3 ) become measurable and can be corrected  @xcite down to a limit imposed by the measurement accuracy and the adjustment precision of the correcting elements . with advanced techniques , such as electron holography  @xcite and exit wave reconstruction from a focal series  @xcite direct information on the specimen , not obscured by the inevitable residual aberrations , can be acquired .",
    "however , these techniques require special arrangements / procedures during the acquisition of the images , and thus can not be applied to a single hrtem image _ post - situ_.    the wave aberrations distort the information transferred from the specimen to the imaging device , such as a ccd camera , making interpretation of the acquired images difficult if not sometimes impossible  @xcite . in a corrected microscope",
    "this problem is to a large extent overcome , as is evident from the nearly aberration - free images of today . in the context of this article , the word _",
    "nearly _ should be emphasized , however .",
    "the aberration coefficients can be tuned down to zero only with some accuracy .",
    "thus , in practice residual aberrations are always present even in corrected instruments  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the instruments tend to drift away from the corrected state over time , and one can expect stronger residual aberrations as time passes after tuning the corrector  @xcite .",
    "residual aberrations can be also of benefit , like in the case of @xmath1 , as non - zero @xmath1 is required for optimal phase contrast transfer  @xcite .     suffering from residual aberrations . *",
    "* a * : a defect structure in single - layer graphene , where the graphene lattice does not appear hexagonal due to residual aberrations .",
    "this effect can be attributed to residual three - fold astigmatism ( @xmath2 ) , which induces a contrast difference between the sublattices of graphene , causing the lattice image to deviate from the hexagonal symmetric pattern expected for graphene .",
    "* b * : mirror - twin - boundaries in single - layer mose@xmath0 . due to residual aberrations ,",
    "the lattice has a completely different appearance on the opposite sides of the boundaries .",
    "compare , for example , the two areas marked by the arrows .",
    "also this effect can be explained by alignment of the mose@xmath0 lattice with residual @xmath2 ( panel * c * ) and by the swapping of the mo and dual se sites in the three - fold symmetric lattice when crossing the boundary ( see panel * d * for the structure , where the dark atoms represent mo and light atoms se , with two se atoms always residing on top of each other ) .",
    "the reversal of the lattice results in the accentuation of different sublattices in these regions .",
    "the scale bars are 2  nm . ]    on the other hand , residual aberrations such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can be present in the order of 100  nm after correction , can lead to undesired artefacts in the images , and the effect of these can be anything from a minor nuisance to complete misinterpretation of the image .",
    "examples of such effects are presented in figure  [ residuala2 ] . in the first panel , an experimental aberration - corrected hrtem",
    "( ac - hrtem ) image of a point defect in single - layer graphene can be seen .",
    "the presence of residual aberrations in the image is clear from the strongly non - hexagonal appearance of the graphene lattice .",
    "this effect can be attributed to the three - fold astigmatism @xmath2 , which has three axes of symmetry in the image plane ( see figure  [ residuala2]c for a visualization ) : depending on the relative orientation of @xmath2 to the graphene lattice , one of the two sublattices of graphene can produce a higher contrast than the other , resulting in the observed non - hexagonal pattern .",
    "the atomic structure of the defect can still be deduced from the experimental image , but the image is far from optimal .    in the second panel ,",
    "an experimental ac - hrtem image of so - called mirror - twin - boundaries in a single - layer mose@xmath0 sample can be seen . in an aberration - free image",
    "the se sites produce higher contrast as compared to the mo sites , as there are always two se ( z=34 ) atoms at the same location as opposed to single mo ( z=42 ) atoms .",
    "however , in the recorded image the lattice has a completely different appearance at the different sides of the linear boundaries ( compare , for example , the areas denoted by the two arrows ) .",
    "on one side the second sublattice has a much higher contrast , but on the other side the sublattices have almost equal contrast , resulting in the hexagonal appearance of the lattice .",
    "this effect can again be attributed to residual @xmath2 , which is oriented matching the sublattices of the crystal with trigonal symmetry ( see figure  [ residuala2 ] panel c ) .",
    "on one side of the boundary the se sites are further enhanced , increasing the contrast difference of the mo and se sites . however , when crossing the boundary , the mo and se sites are interchanged ( see figure  [ residuala2 ] panel d ) , and now the @xmath2 has the effect of reducing the contrast difference resulting in nearly equal contrast for the mo and se sites .",
    "evaluation of the contrast could lead one to deduce that there are two different materials on the opposite sides of the boundary , which in fact is not the case .",
    "we would like to emphasize that these artefacts are not introduced by exceptionally strong residual aberrations . under our experimental conditions ,",
    "the @xmath2 coefficient is in the order of 100  nm , which is a typical state of correction , after tuning , in our microscope ( fei titan 80 - 300 , operated at 80  kv ) .",
    "as mentioned above , numerous methods for acquiring truly aberration - free images in tem have been proposed and implemented in practice .",
    "the common denominator of these methods is that they aim at recovering the object wave function , which then can be manipulated much more freely and interpreted more directly than a simple intensity image  @xcite . in electron holography  @xcite",
    ", an iterference pattern between the object wave and a reference wave is generated with the help of a bi - prism , and direct information on the object wave can be recovered numerically from this pattern .",
    "the @xmath1 corrector improves the phase - detection limit of electron holography significantly  @xcite .",
    "another group of methods is in - line holography , _",
    "i.e. _ , exit wave reconstruction  @xcite , where typically a series of images at equally spaced foci is acquired and subsequently the object wave is deduced iteratively . after the raw electron wave is recovered , the influence of any residual aberrations can be corrected  @xcite .",
    "a common drawback of these methods , however , is that they all require special arrangements and/or procedures during acquisition of the images , and hence can not be applied to a single hrtem image during post - processing .",
    "such a situation can be quite frustrating if the microscopist has managed to capture an elusive target during imaging , but the resulting image is of poor quality .    here",
    ", we present a method for numerically removing the effects of a specific group of geometric aberrations ( the anti - symmetric ones , as discussed later ) _ after _ acquisition in single hrtem images of weakly scattering objects .",
    "the requirement of the investigated object to be a weak scatterer is a strong one , and precludes a large number of typically studied materials from the applicability range of the method .",
    "however , one important and intensively studied group of materials , that is , the recently discovered class of 2d materials with graphene as the prime example , do approximately satisfy this condition at typically used acceleration voltages such as 80  kv  @xcite , making the method potentially useful in a large number of studies .    in analogy to the phase reconstruction methods ( focal series and off - axis holography ) where residual aberrations are removed from the wave function after the reconstruction",
    ", we remove the contribution of the residual anti - symmetric aberrations using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , but instead of the full wave function , we work on a single image , which is possible in the case of a weakly scattering object , that is , when the linear imaging theory is valid  @xcite . because the weakly scattering objects we investigate are 2d - objects like graphene , the tilt angles are usually small and the effect of object tilt will be neglected in the first approximation .",
    "we want to make clear , that the effect of the symmetric aberrations , such as defocus or @xmath1 can not be remedied by our method .",
    "this is clear already from the fact that the symmetric aberrations lead to loss of information at certain frequencies ( the zero crossing points of the contrast transfer function ) , which of course can not be recovered .",
    "we find our method to be particularly useful for removing the effects of residual aberrations in distorted ac - hrtem images of weakly scattering 2d - materials , where information is available on how the image _ should _ look like , as demonstrated with the examples of graphene and mose@xmath0 .",
    "first , we present the theoretical background and justification of our method .",
    "we follow closely the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    assuming coherent illumination and exluding the damping envelopes from the treatment , the wave function @xmath4 at the image plane at a distance @xmath5 from the object along the optical axis can be written as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the wave at the exit surface , @xmath8 is the scattered wave , @xmath9 is the lens transfer function and @xmath10 denotes convolution .",
    "the image intensity @xmath11 is the square modulus of the wave at the detector plane , and its fourier transform @xmath12 can be written as    @xmath13    in the case of a weakly scattering object ( that is , when the weak phase object approximation is valid ) , an approximation can be made here  @xcite .",
    "that is , the last term on the second line of the equation can be deemed to be small , which is in effect a transition from the general non - linear imaging theory to the special case of linear imaging theory . fortunately , 2d - materials such as graphene fulfil this condition at typical acceleration voltages such as 80  kv  @xcite and , as demonstrated by simulations and experiments below , the method can be applied on images of such materials .",
    "equation  2 now becomes    @xmath14    where @xmath15 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath8 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath16 is written in the explicit form @xmath17 .",
    "the information about the microscope aberrations are encoded in the wave aberration function @xmath18 .",
    "now , @xmath18 can be represented as a power series where each term represents a specific aberration .",
    "the terms of the series can be divided into symmetric @xmath19 and anti - symmetric @xmath20 parts .",
    "notably , the defocus and @xmath1 belong to the symmetric group and @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the anti - symmetric group .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can be rewritten as    @xmath21    from this equation it is evident , that the effect of all the _ anti - symmetric _ aberrations can be removed from the image by simply multiplying @xmath12 by @xmath22 and calculating the inverse fourier transform .",
    "that is , a corrected image @xmath23 can be generated by    @xmath24    the problem of correcting the residual aberrations is two - fold , however .",
    "so far we have shown that , in principe , the anti - symmeric aberration contribution in a hrtem image of a weakly scattering object can be freely manipulated in post - processing . however , in order to do actual correction , the aberration coefficients and orientations need to be determined .",
    "this is a shared challenge with all the methods aiming to correct aberrations in tem , and of course one is limited by the accuracy at which the aberrations can be measured .",
    "information on the residual aberrations is offered by the corrector based on a series of tilted - beam images  @xcite .",
    "other methods for measuring the residual aberrations , _",
    "e.g. _ , from a focus / tilt series  @xcite or even a single hrtem image  @xcite have been presented in the literature .",
    "the aberrations could , in priciple , be removed with the corrector once determined , but , _ e.g. _ , due to drift of the corrector state during searching of an area of interest and image acquisition  @xcite and finite precision of the corrector adjustment , typically residual aberrations in the final images are inevitable .",
    "post - acquisition correction by the harware corrector is of course not possible , and one needs to find new strategies for fine - tuning the existing images if necessary .",
    "one alternative is to look at a feature of an image ( _ e.g. _ , the pristine graphene lattice ) and find the coefficients which result in the expected appearance for an aberration - free image by trial and error .",
    "great care should be taken with this approach , however , as the problem can be underdetermined .",
    "for example , in our example case of three - fold @xmath2 astigmatism and mose@xmath0 ( see e.g. the illustration in figure  [ residuala2 ] panel c ) the same sublattice imbalance can be introduced by different combinations of amplitude and relative orientation of the @xmath2 and the mose@xmath0 lattice . a conservative approach in such a situation is to find the orientation where the smallest possible amplitude corrects the visible effect .",
    "if the actual orientation of the real residual aberration would be different from this , some residual aberration would remain ( the new residual aberration is the vector sum of the real aberration and the correcting aberration ) , but the situation would still be improved and the aberration would not be over corrected. the situation is further complicated , if multiple dominant residual aberrations are present . however , often the third - order anti - symmetric aberrations , that is @xmath3 and @xmath2 are dominating ( assuming defocus and first - order astigmatism are properly tuned ) . in the special case of 2d - materials , which tend to have a three - fold symmetry , the three - fold symmetric @xmath2 has a distinctive effect on the appearance of the lattice , and thus can be distinguished from the effects of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , even if the aberration post - correction is not ideal , a significantly better result can be achieved in suitable situations , as shown below by experiments and simulations .",
    "all the experimental images presented here were acquired using an fei titan 80 - 300 microscope equipped with an image - side hexapole aberration corrector  @xcite .",
    "the microscope was operated at 80  kv and a reduced extraction voltage of 2  kv , in order to reduce the energy spread of the electron beam .",
    "the @xmath1 was corrected to @xmath2520  @xmath26 m and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 were corrected to the order of 100  nm ( unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "the graphene samples were produced by the chemical vapor deposition method ( acquired commercially from graphenea s. a. ) and transferred on quantifoil tem - grids by the procedure described in ref .",
    "the defect in figure  [ residuala2]a is produced by carbon deposition , as will be described in detail in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "the mose@xmath0 sample was produced by molecular beam epitaxy and transferred on to pelco holey silicon nitride tem grids ( a detailed study on this sample will be presented also in a separate article  @xcite ) .",
    "the image simulations were conducted using the qstem software package  @xcite , using @xmath27  20  @xmath26 m and focus spread of 6  nm .",
    "the simulated structure consisted of 149 mo and 288 se atoms .",
    "and the simulation cell size was 6  nm@xmath286  nm with a sampling of 0.03   / pixel ( the panels in figure  [ simulated_correction ] are cropped from the top right ) .",
    "to verify our approach in the case of the low - order @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we first conducted image simulations , where one has precise control over the aberrations influencing the image . in figure",
    "[ simulated_correction]a , a mose@xmath0 target with an embedded triangular mirror - domain is simulated with @xmath29 .",
    "the domain - boundaries are visible , and the lattice inside and outside looks identical except for the reversed order of the darker and brighter appearing sublattices . in order to emulate the effect observed in the experimental image of  [ residuala2 ] ,",
    "a hrtem image was simulated with @xmath30  nm , and 30@xmath31 as the azimuthal orientation of both of the aberrations ( figure  [ simulated_correction]b ) . with these parameters",
    "the lattice appears completely different inside and outside the mirror - domain .",
    "this image was then processed according to equation  [ corrector ] using the known @xmath2 and @xmath3 coefficients and orientations , and the resulting image is shown in panel  c of figure  [ simulated_correction ] .",
    "the aberration - free appearance of the image is restored by the correction procedure , as predicted .",
    "flake with an embedded mirror domain with zero anti - symmetric aberrations .",
    "the same structure simulated with @xmath30  nm/30@xmath31 ( * b * ) and @xmath32  @xmath26m/30@xmath31 ( * d * ) .",
    "* c * and * e * : the images of * b * and * d * after applying the correction , with the known parameters .",
    "the aberration - free appearance of the image was restored by the method in both cases .",
    "the scale bar is 1  nm . ]    we also tested the procedure in more extreme conditions , that is , with @xmath33 @xmath26 m .",
    "this does not represent typical experimental conditions , but should be considered as an artificial test with very strong aberrations .",
    "the simulated image is shown in figure  [ simulated_correction]d , where the whole image is scrambled by the aberrations and interpretation of the image is practically impossible . however , after applying equation  [ corrector ] with the known parameters , the image is restored to an aberration - free state . here",
    ", it should be pointed out that close inspection of the corrected image reveals some features which are absent in the reference image ( panel a ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the vacuum area .",
    "this is due to some information being displaced outside the image frame by the ( in this case ) large point spread function / image delocalization induced by the large aberrations , which then is missing also in the corrected image .",
    "generally speaking , one should avoid interpreting the corrected image within an margin at the image edges with a width determined by the point spread function / image delocalization .    in order to verify our method also in an experimental situation",
    ", we took the ac - hrtem images of figure  [ residuala2 ] , and applied equation  [ corrector ] . in the case of graphene",
    ", we iteratively found the amplitude and orientation of @xmath34  nm/17@xmath31 which resulted in the removal of visible asymmetry between the two sublattices of graphene .",
    "the corrected experimental image is presented in figure  [ corrected_exps]a , with the original image shown as inset .",
    "the graphene lattice has now the expected hexagonal appearance , and interpretation of the image is made more straight - forward . for the case of mose@xmath0 , @xmath35  nm/15@xmath31 was found to restore the expected appearance of the lattice on both sides of the mirror - twin - boundaries in the experimental image .",
    "an interesting observation in the case of mose@xmath0 is that the point defects are actually more visible in one of the domains in the original ( non - corrected ) image , and also the boundaries are easier to locate due to the different appearances of the lattice on the opposite sides of the boundaries .",
    "this bears resemblance to the well known effect of moving away from the optimal scherzer focus in order to make point defects more visible to the eye ( see , _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "no new information is added to the image by the anti - symmetric aberrations , but features are made more evident to the eye .",
    "a clear advantage of this approach is that the aberrations can subsequently be corrected with no information losses , as the anti - symmetric aberrations introduce only phase shifts and the phase contrast transfer function is not altered .",
    "if the presence of anti - symmetric residual aberrations is deemed beneficial in some situation , our method can just as well be used to _ increase _ the effect of these aberrations during post - processing .",
    "another experimental test was conducted by willfully introducing strong @xmath2 with the corrector of the microscope and acquiring images with such an ill - tuned system ( @xmath36  @xmath26m/48@xmath31 , as measured by the corrector software ) . in figure  [ corrected_exps2 ] a and b , two locations in the graphene sample",
    "are shown . in panel",
    "a it is clear that a tilt grain boundary runs through the center of the image , separating two areas with different lattice orientations .",
    "however , the structure of the boundary can not be analyzed in the image , and the graphene lattice has a completely different appearance on the opposite sides of the boundary ( due to different relative orientations of the lattices relative to the @xmath2 orientation ) . in panel b , a point defect in the graphene lattice can be detected , but again its structure remains hidden by @xmath2 .",
    "the correction method was applied to both images using the @xmath2 value of 1  @xmath26 m at an angle of 41.5@xmath31 ( measured by the corrector software ) as the starting point , and fine tuning the parameters based on visual inspection of the image . in both cases",
    "the effect of @xmath2 was remedied . in the case of the grain boundary ( panel c ) a 5 - 7 dislocation",
    "is now visible , as expected for a tilt - grain - boundary in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the image of the point defect ( panel d ) shows the recongnizable pattern of a reconstructed divacancy in graphene  @xcite after correction .",
    "a after application of the correction method with @xmath34  nm/17@xmath31 .",

    "the scale bars are 2  nm . ]",
    "to conclude , we have presented a method for correcting the anti - symmetric sub - group of aberrations in hrtem images during numerical post - processing in the case of weakly scattering objects , and verified its applicability in the case of the often dominant low - order @xmath2 and @xmath3 aberrations through simulations and experiments with graphene and 2d mose@xmath0 .",
    "this procedure can be performed on a single conventional hrtem image , that is , retrieval of the object wave is not necessary .",
    "the requirement of a weakly scattering object imposes a strong limitation on the range of materials where the method is applicable .",
    "however , the intensively studied class of 2d materials , with graphene as the prime example , do satisfy this condition at commonly used acceleration voltages such as 80  kv  @xcite .",

    "great care should be taken , however , as the problem can be underdetermined , and multiple aberration coefficient combinations can lead to the same final result .",
    "the method allows some flexibility during the acquisition of images : as the anti - symmetric residual aberrations can be corrected during post - processing , it is not imperative to have the corrector perfectly tuned at all times .",
    "a reasonably good state of correction is important during acquisition , however , in order to enable the operator of the microscope to recognize the imaged features ( compare , _",
