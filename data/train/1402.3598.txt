    "after several tevatron legacy measurements with the full data set  @xcite and the most recent data from the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , the potential presence of new physics in @xmath1 production resulting in an anomalously large forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry remains intriguing .",
    "measurements at tevatron are above the standard model ( sm ) predictions  @xcite , for example @xmath10 standard deviations ( @xmath11 ) in the case of the inclusive @xmath12 asymmetry @xmath13  @xcite , which raises to @xmath14 for high @xmath1 invariant masses @xmath15 gev . but",
    ", on the other hand , measurements of the @xmath1 charge asymmetry @xmath16 at the lhc exhibit a good consistency with the sm expectations . at first glance , this is a surprising fact , because @xmath13 and @xmath16 origin from the very same partonic asymmetries @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 and @xmath16 are tightly correlated  @xcite in the simple models  @xcite that were first proposed to explain the @xmath13 measurement  @xcite . in these models , with a single extra particle , either @xmath17 or @xmath18 is zero , or they have the same sign .",
    "likewise , it is also expected that ( isospin - symmetric ) missing sm contributions that might increase the prediction of @xmath13 to make it closer to the experimental measurement , would also enhance @xmath16 and worsen the agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , although tevatron and lhc measurements are not incompatible , they are in tension within the sm and its simple extensions .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to have an excess at the tevatron and no excess at the lhc if there is a cancellation of some type .",
    "there are two known ways to achieve this :    1 .   a cancellation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 contributions  @xcite ,",
    "as implemented for example in @xmath23-channel colour octet models  @xcite .",
    "if the asymmetries @xmath17 , @xmath18 have different sign , the higher importance of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath21 at the lhc the ratio of cross sections @xmath24 is a factor of three higher at the lhc than at the tevatron makes it possible to have a positive asymmetry @xmath13 , dominated by @xmath17 , at the tevatron , and a very small asymmetry @xmath16 at the lhc .",
    "2 .   a cancellation between @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 contributions , as for example in @xmath28 models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 processes are irrelevant at the tevatron but not at the lhc . there ,",
    "a negative asymmetry in @xmath30 could compensate a positive asymmetry in @xmath31 , if one considers not only @xmath12 production but also including additional jets .",
    "this model is disfavoured by the measurement of the high-@xmath32 tail at the lhc and may eventually be excluded with more precise measurements , but serves as a good benchmark for our discussion .",
    "thus , the small sm - like asymmetry observed at the lhc may in principle result from two asymmetries of opposite sign ( the naturalness of this mechanism is a different issue ) . but the addition of a final state photon completely changes this",
    ". an asymmetry can be defined in @xmath0 production @xmath33 with @xmath34 the difference between the moduli of the rapidities of the top and antitop .",
    "that is , the same definition for the charge asymmetry as in @xmath1 production . in the sm ,",
    "this asymmetry arises already at the tree level in @xmath35 due to the interference between diagrams where the photon is emitted from initial quarks and diagrams where it is emitted from final state quarks . at a centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath36 tev the tree - level value is @xmath37 , and at @xmath38 tev it is @xmath39 .",
    "comparing to @xmath1 alone , the effect of the extra photon is twofold .",
    "first , it increases the @xmath40 fraction of total events @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , thus reducing the washout due to symmetric @xmath44 fusion .",
    "( for simplicity we ignore here @xmath45 and @xmath46 initial states , which are irrelevant for the discussion . )",
    "second , and even more importantly , if there is a cancellation between new physics contributions to turn @xmath16 small , the addition of a photon is likely to break it in @xmath47 .",
    "this is expected to be a general fact , and indeed is confirmed in this paper for the two aforementioned mechanisms .",
    "in the first case , namely a cancellation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 contributions at the lhc , such cancellation is broken mainly because the photon couples differently to up and down quarks , and @xmath50 is enhanced with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "the effect can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ( left ) , where we plot the @xmath52 fraction @xmath41 against the ratio @xmath53 for the sm processes .",
    "kinematical cuts on the @xmath1 velocity @xmath54  @xcite and the @xmath1 invariant mass @xmath55 lead to small shifts in @xmath53 and @xmath41 towards the tevatron point .",
    "but , clearly , requiring a final state photon is much more effective : it renders @xmath53 very close to the tevatron value ( thus breaking a possible cancellation ) and also increases the @xmath40 fraction by a factor of two , leading to larger asymmetries . for new physics contributions",
    "such as an @xmath23-channel colour octet that do not significantly alter the kinematics of @xmath1 and @xmath0 production , the behaviour is the same .",
    "note also that @xmath53 is nearly the same at the lhc with @xmath56 and 14 tev ( as well as with 7 tev ) , hence the possible cancellation will also operate at 14 tev and the measurement of @xmath16 at this energy is expected to show good consistency with the sm .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the difference found between 8 tev and 14 tev is given by the much better statistics at the latter cm energy , which by far compensates the slightly smaller @xmath47 due to the increased @xmath44 cross section .",
    "( as pointed out before , the ratio @xmath53 is nearly the same at these two energies . )",
    "interestingly , for the parameter space points ( in green ) that predict an asymmetry @xmath13 within @xmath57 of the tevatron average , the asymmetry in @xmath0 departs @xmath58 or more above the sm value .",
    "this happens irrespectively of the value of the asymmetry in @xmath1 production @xmath16 , that may even have the sm value .",
    "we also note that for all points the increase in @xmath47 with respect to the sm value is positive .",
    "this is expected from the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ( left ) , and is clearly because the increase in @xmath13 with respect to the sm value is also positive , as preferred by the fit to the tevatron measurements .",
    "we have chosen a reference point in the extra @xmath28 model that represents the region of parameter space compatible with the relevant observables as stated in the study in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have set @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 and an invisible @xmath28 branching ratio @xmath61 .",
    "this model predicts a charge asymmetry at the lhc of @xmath62 at 8 tev , which is compatible with cms measurement  @xcite and sm predictions .",
    "however , when an extra photon is required , its prediction yields @xmath63 and @xmath64 at 8 and 14 tev , respectively , which again is an excess over the sm expected asymmetry ( compare to sm prediction in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttavstt ] ) .",
    "we see that also in this case , the 8 tev measurement of @xmath47 would not differentiate this model from sm , but we can expect that 400 fb@xmath65 at 14 tev could be able to do it .",
    "finally , in order to stress the importance of @xmath47 , we have checked that in both models the prediction of @xmath16 in @xmath1 production at 14 tev is always consistent with the sm , taking an experimental uncertainty of @xmath66 .",
    "this is expected from the arguments given in the introduction .",
    "if a cancellation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 contributions takes place to render the lhc asymmetry small at 7 and 8 tev , it should also operate at 14 tev , where @xmath53 is similar . or",
    ", if there exists a cancellation between @xmath67 and @xmath69 , at 14 tev this cancellation is relaxed by the larger @xmath70 but the resulting asymmetry is small anyway .",
    "after few years of measurements with increasing precision , the excess asymmetry @xmath13 in @xmath1 production at the tevatron and the sm - like charge asymmetry @xmath16 in @xmath1 production at the lhc continue to be puzzling .",
    "if new data confirm the current central values and reduce their uncertainties , it is unlikely that both can be explained within the sm ( also with additional isospin - conserving contributions yet unaccounted for ) and simple extensions .",
    "barring the possibility of unknown systematic uncertainties , the only way to explain these measurements is by means of some cancellation of new physics contributions at the lhc , to give approximately the sm value .    a previous attempt to solve",
    "this puzzle has been the introduction of the collider - independent asymmetries  @xcite @xmath17 , @xmath18 that are the same at the tevatron and the lhc , and whose measurement quite demanding from the experimental point of view could settle the issue .",
    "also , the determination of ratios of differential asymmetries  @xcite would be useful to uncover possible anomalies . in this paper we have pointed out that , if the pattern of large @xmath13 and sm - like @xmath16 corresponds to some cancellation , such cancellation should not occur in @xmath0 production at the lhc , where the additional photon alters the balance between new physics contributions with respect to @xmath1 alone .",
    "this fact turns extremely interesting the measurement of a charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production .",
    "moreover , even if the tevatron excess is not due to new physics , the measurement of @xmath47 could bring light into the nature of the tevatron anomaly .",
    "we have studied the feasibility of this measurement and we have shown that the unwanted contributions to the final state of interest , where the photon is radiated off the top quark decay products , can be effectively suppressed with a judicious set of kinematical cuts .",
    "we have then estimated the experimental uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath47 , to investigate the potential to observe deviations from the sm .    at 7 and 8",
    "tev , the statistics is likely not enough to reach a conclusive statement . at 14 tev",
    ", we have shown that there are good chances of observing a deviation from the sm prediction in the case of a colour octet and in the extra @xmath28 model . in both cases",
    "we do find an excess in @xmath47 with respect to the sm and we argue that this should be in general expected for new physics models that yield an excess in @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the predictions for the charge asymmetry @xmath16 in @xmath1 production at 14 tev are close to the sm expectation .",
    "therefore aside more demanding doubly - differential studies of the @xmath54 and @xmath32 dependence of @xmath16  @xcite or ratios of differential asymmetries  @xcite the measurement of a charge asymmetry in @xmath71 seems the best avenue to explore fb - asymmetric @xmath12 production in the upcoming lhc run .",
