    "quarks as well as leptons are known to mix , and the collective structure of these flavor oscillations has been a standing puzzle for decades . since the discovery of neutrino oscillation , it is now well known that this phenomena could be described by a unitary matrix of at least rank three .",
    "recent hints from t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite , double - chooz  @xcite , and discovery from daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite have now established a large value for the @xmath4 mixing angle in the neutrino sector .",
    "existing global fits to a suite of neutrino oscillation experiments are summarized in the table  [ tbl : exp_results ] for both normal hierarchy ( nh ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) scenarios  @xcite ( see also ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) . the experimental observation of a large lepton mixing angle @xmath9 is clearly incompatible with the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) pattern  @xcite , @xmath10 which yields the following values for the mixing angles , @xmath11    there have been many attempts to address the problem of fermion mass hierarchy and mixing .",
    "a particularly popular approach has been through the introduction of a family symmetry , with which the number of free parameters in the yukawa sector can be reduced .",
    "the symmetries proposed include the continuous ones , such as @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite , and the discrete ones  @xcite , such as @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "these discrete symmetries are particularly conducive to the tbm mixing pattern ; in particular it has been shown that an additional @xmath15 symmetry can generate lepton mixing matrix naturally  @xcite",
    ". however , there exists no simple model featuring an a4 symmetry which gives rise to quark mixing .",
    "as such a model would likely require additional mechanisms to be consistent with the quark sector  @xcite , it is thus less compiling to combine a4 with a grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    ".the current global fitting results on the neutrino mixing angles and mass splittings from  @xcite .

    "the yukawa couplings are real , which can be achieved through appropriate redefinition of the flavor fields  @xcite . at the scale @xmath20 ,",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is broken spontaneously and the flavon fields acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) along the following directions , @xmath21 we leave the study of the potential which gives rise to this alignment for future work .",
    "as such , we will not consider inputs from this sector in the counting of parameters needed to achieve the observed mixing , as these additional parameters in the flavon and higgs sectors ( such as @xmath22 ) will lead to additional predictions such as the flavon and higgs masses .    upon the @xmath1 symmetry breaking , the operators in @xmath23 , and @xmath24 give rise to the masses of the up - type quarks , both the down - type quarks and charged leptons , and the neutrinos respectively .",
    "in terms of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 component fields , the above superpotential gives the following yukawa interactions for the charged fermions in the weak charged current interaction eigenstates : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the quark doublets , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the iso - singet up - type and down - type quarks , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the generation indices .",
    "similarly , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the iso - doublet and singlet charged leptons , respectively .",
    "the matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , upon the breaking of @xmath1 and the electroweak symmetry , are given by  @xcite , @xmath36 the @xmath0 symmetry in the model leads to the relation @xmath37 , up to the @xmath0 cg s .",
    "specifically , there is an additional factor of @xmath38 in the ( 2,2 ) entry of @xmath35 due to the coupling to @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , the georgi - jarlskog ( gj ) relations require @xmath40 to be non - diagonal , leading to corrections to the tbm pattern  @xcite .",
    "note that the complex coefficients in the above mass matrices arise _ entirely _ from the cg coefficients of the @xmath1 group theory .",
    "more precisely , these complex cg coefficients appear in couplings that involve the doublet representations of @xmath1 .    in total , the mass matrices in the charged fermion sector , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , depend on seven independent parameters , @xmath41 where @xmath42 with the numerical choice of @xmath43 the following mass ratios are obtained , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cabbibo angle .",
    "these ratios in terms of powers of @xmath46 agree with those given in  @xcite .",
    "we have also taken @xmath47 the effects of the renormalization group corrections have been taken into account in our numerical predictions , which are quoted at the electroweak scale . as a result of the gj relations ,",
    "realistic charged lepton masses are obtained .",

    "our predictions for the wolfenstein parameters are , @xmath53 which are very close to the global fit values except for @xmath54 .",
    "the jarlskog invariant is predicted to be , @xmath55 in the quark sector and also agrees with the current global fit value .",
    "potential direct measurements at the lhcb for these parameters can test our predictions .",
    "the small neutrino masses are generated through the type - i see - saw mechanism .",
    "the right - handed majorana mass matrix is given by , @xmath56 with the dirac neutrino mass matrix being , @xmath57 without loss of generality , we have implicitly set @xmath58 . in the type - i seesaw framework , after integrating out the right - handed neutrinos , the effective neutrino mass matrix is given by , @xmath59 specifically for our model , the effective neutrino mass matrix is given in terms of the flavon vevs as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the overall neutrino mass scale . in the absence of the contribution from the singlet scalar , @xmath62 , which corresponds to the exact model in  @xcite , the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath63 is diagonalized by the tbm mixing matrix .    with @xmath64 ,",
    "the neutrino diagonalization matrix deviates from the tbm matrix .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the structure of the diagonalization matrix , in particular the analytic form of the deviations from tbm mixing pattern , we first multiply the effective neutrino mass matrix by @xmath65 on both sides . the resulting mass matrix @xmath66 is simplified as , @xmath67 we immediately find that the resulting mass matrix @xmath68 is diagonalizable by a further rotation in the @xmath69-plane @xmath70 with the rotation matrix @xmath71 defined as , @xmath72 @xmath73 being a diagonal phase matrix , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 being the absolute effective neutrinos masses . defining the following variables , @xmath77 the neutrinos masses @xmath78 and the additional rotational angle @xmath79 can then be written as functions of * a * , * b * and * c*. we find @xmath80    as the overall phase for all masses is not physical , without losing any generality , we choose the overall mass scale @xmath81 to be negative so that @xmath82 is positive . for @xmath83 , normal mass hierarchy",
    "is predicted ; otherwise , it is inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath84 is always positive unless both @xmath83 and @xmath85 are satisfied .",
    "similarly , @xmath86 is always negative unless @xmath87 and @xmath85 are satisfied simultaneously . the phase matrix , @xmath73 is given by @xmath88 for inverted hierarchy , and @xmath89 for the normal hierarchy .",
    "the overall coefficient @xmath90 for the normal hierarchy case is an overall phase and has no physical meaning .",
    "there are additional mass sum rules such as , @xmath91 \\frac{(\\zeta_0\\zeta_0^{\\prime}v_u)^2}{s_0\\lambda } \\;,\\ ] ] and in terms of the absolute neutrino masses , @xmath92 which can be used to check against our numerical results .",
    "it is worth noting that some previously found sum rules occur in models with two free parameters in the neutrino sector . in this case ,",
    "one of the masses is constrained against the other two .",
    "our model features three free parameters , which in turn constrains the sum of the masses to be some combination in terms of the model parameters as shown in eq .",
    "36 . for examples of sum rules in models with only two parameters in the neutrino sector ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the full diagonalization matrix in the neutrino sector is given by @xmath93 , @xmath94 the corresponding mixing angles are then given by , @xmath95 in the limit of @xmath96 , these expressions coincide with the tbm predictions , @xmath97 as expected .    to obtain the full leptonic mixing matrix , the diagonalization matrix in the charged lepton sector must be taken into account .",

    "<S> in the model based on susy @xmath0 combined with the @xmath1 family symmetry , it is shown  @xcite that fermion mass hierarchy and mixing angles can be naturally generated in both lepton and quark sectors compatible with various experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> but the predicted value for the non - zero lepton mixing angle of @xmath2 contradicts the recent experimental results from daya bay and reno . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to introduce one more singlet flavon field in the neutrino sector , and with its additional contribution , we are able to generate the large mixing angle @xmath3 . the analytical expressions of the mixing angles and neutrino masses with the additional flavon field are derived . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that a large region in the model parameter space is allowed for the normal hierarchy case , while a much smaller region is allowed for the inverted hierarchy case . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the predicted value of the solar mixing angle is not affected by the additional singlet contribution . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a correlation between @xmath4 value and @xmath5 , as a result of the additional singlet contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also make predictions for various other variables that can be potentially tested in the future neutrino experiments such as the dirac cp phase , which is predicted to be in the range of @xmath6 , and the neutrinoless double beta decay matrix element , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> one numerical example with the minimal @xmath8 fit is presented , and the model predictions are consistent with all experimental results . </S>"
