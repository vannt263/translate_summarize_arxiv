    "the study of many - body phenomena in low dimensional systems is attracting a lot of attention .",
    "this has been motivated by recent advances in the construction of nanostructures and quantum dot devices .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy has also opened the possibility of analyzing many - body phenomena at surfaces .",
    "for instance , the kondo effect has been detected in stm conductance measurements of noble metal surfaces with adsorbed 3d transition metal atoms.@xcite characteristic zero bias lineshapes are observed which are reminiscent of fano@xcite phenomena .",
    "fano lineshapes have been observed in different situations .",
    "they were first explored by fano @xcite in his studies of autoionization of doubly excited he(2s2p ) resonances lying in the continuum . in the case of adsorbed atoms on a metal surface",
    "an analogous situation is found as a localized orbital is also coupled to a continuum of metallic states . as the adsorbate is magnetic , the kondo effect can occur and , therefore , fano lineshapes can be thought of as arising from the interference of the kondo resonance with the continuum of metal states.@xcite it is worth noting that fano phenomena appears in stm measurements although the tip overlaps much more strongly with the surface than with the adsorbate wavefunctions ( as the 3d orbitals are very localized ) so that conductance measurements reflect electronic properties of the metal surface modified by the presence of the magnetic atom .",
    "these fano - type lineshapes differ from one adsorbate / substrate system to another , as summarized in table [ table1 ] , although some experimental trends can be extracted .",
    "for instance , the fano parameter , @xmath1 , is typically either zero or positive .",
    "as can be observed from the table the lineshape associated with @xmath2 is a symmetric dip close to zero bias .",
    "the dependence of lineshapes may be illustrated by comparing the asymmetric dip observed for co on cu(100 ) with the symmetric dip - like shape found for co on cu(111 ) .",
    "similarly adsorbing ti instead of co on au(111 ) leads to a strong variation of the lineshape .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated if we consider the `` middle '' elements of the 3d row which do not even show appreciable features in the conductance@xcite down to @xmath3 k. this raises questions about the occurrence of the kondo effect at all for these specific adsorbates .",
    "hence , experimental observations suggest that details associated with the adsorbate - substrate interaction may be relevant .    .non - universality of lineshapes observed in conductance measurements between a stm tip and a noble metal surface with adsorbed 3d transition metal atoms and ce . depending on the adsorbate , the type of noble metal and/or the surface face , observed conductance lineshapes are different .",
    "the fano parameter , @xmath1 , which measures the degree of asymmetry of the lineshape associated with the kondo resonance is typically @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath18 and conductance lineshapes are more asymmetric ( @xmath19 in the most asymmetric lineshape ) .",
    "hence , experimental observations requires that @xmath8 is in between cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "however , if we consider an sp - like band for the substrate and assume that hybridization matrix elements are independent of momentum , @xmath8 would be parabolic ( from eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) ) , growing up to infinite energies . due to the large asymmetry in @xmath8",
    ", @xmath20 would be very large and negative so that @xmath21 leading to a peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) rather than the dip typically observed in experiments .",
    "hence , it seems difficult to reconcile the observed conductance lineshapes with the shape of @xmath8 from this simplified picture .",
    "the question that we address in the present work is whether the momentum dependence of hybridization matrix elements can change @xmath8 leading to more symmetric conductance lineshapes .",
    "first attempts to model the substrate electronic structure have been carried out by plihal and gadzuk@xcite who have used a jellium metal with a sharp step potential barrier at the surface . however , a half - filled symmetric density of states to describe the substrate ( instead of parabolic ) and momentum independent adsorbate - substrate hybridization matrix elements , @xmath13 , were used . under these strong assumptions",
    "dip - like conductance lineshapes were obtained .",
    "tight - binding descriptions of the substrate have also been used.@xcite they provide a qualitative understanding of observations although their use is difficult to justify considering the sp free - like bands of noble metal surfaces .",
    "the above discussion shows the difficulty of describing experimental observations in a consistent way and points out the need of a more realistic model for describing the adsorbate - substrate - tip system .",
    "an issue which needs to be carefully addressed in defining the relevant model is to know which of the states associated with the surface ( either surface and/or bulk states ) are more strongly coupled to the adsorbate .",
    "there is experimental evidence suggesting that surface states play only a minor role in the metal - adsorbate interaction @xcite .",
    "for instance , the amplitude of the conductance decays rapidly as , @xmath22 , with lateral displacement of the tip , @xmath23 , instead of decaying as @xmath24 expected for surface states coupled to the impurity .",
    "furthermore , this bulk - like behavior persists in conductance measurements of co on cu(111 ) , which is known to have a surface state at the fermi energy @xcite . based on the above experimental observations we will only consider bulk states in our model .",
    "another experimental observation is that lineshapes depend only weakly with perpendicular tip - substrate distance , @xmath25 , suggesting that the direct interaction between the tip and the adsorbate is negligible@xcite .    in the present work",
    "we show how using an anderson model in an appropriate orthogonalized basis , reasonably symmetric shapes of @xmath8 are found which lead to conductance lineshapes in agreement with observations .",
    "we find that the momentum dependence of the hybridization matrix elements between the adsorbate @xmath26 orbital and the orthogonalized metal wavefunctions together with the finite size of the tip wavefunction are responsible for this behavior .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectheo ]",
    "we introduce an anderson model in an orthogonalized basis to describe the adsorbate - substrate interaction together with the relevant formulas needed for discussing stm conductance measurements . in section [ secdis ] we compute the parameters involved in the adsorbate- substrate interaction needed in the anderson model .",
    "section [ secres ] is devoted to describing the main results of our model .",
    "finally , in section [ secco ] , we apply the model proposed to conductance measurements of co atoms on noble metal surfaces .",
    "in this section , details about the model used are given .",
    "an anderson model on an orthogonal basis is considered .",
    "the parameters of the model are computed taking into account the following considerations : ( i ) instead of a step barrier we consider a jones - jennings - jepsen ( jjj ) potential @xcite to describe the metal surface wavefunctions , ( ii ) we neglect the direct coupling of the tip with the substrate d bands and with the 3d orbital of the adsorbate due to the localized nature of the d orbitals , ( iii ) the adsorbate is modelled by a single d - orbital , and ( iv ) the momentum dependence of the hybridization matrix elements is explicitly taken into account .",
    "metallic states , @xmath27 , coupled to a single @xmath28 orbital denoted by @xmath29 are considered .",
    "the anderson model usually assumes that the cotinuum of metal states are orthogonal to the localized orbitals of the adsorbate .",
    "however , the basis set formed by the unperturbed metal , adsorbate and tip wavefunctions , @xmath30 , is non - orthogonal ( in general ) and overcomplete .",
    "one way to take into account orthogonalization effects is to redefine the metallic states , @xmath31 , as : @xmath32 considering that tip and adsorbate wavefunctions are orthogonal : @xmath33 , as @xmath29 is very localized , then the new metallic states satisfy @xmath34 where @xmath35 can be either @xmath36 or @xmath29 .",
    "our starting point is an anderson model defined in this new orthogonal basis : @xmath37 , from which associated one - electron parameters , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are obtained .",
    "an analogous procedure was previously used in the context of chemisorption of atoms and molecules on metal surfaces by grimley . @xcite",
    "it is worth mentioning that the new metallic states are non - orthogonal among each other : @xmath41 hence , the orthogonalization condition between different @xmath42 states is violated .",
    "however , this occurs at higher order in the overlap : @xmath43 .      from the above considerations , our model for the complete tip - substrate system ( with the 3d transition metal atom ) reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 describes the substrate with the adsorbed 3d transition metal atom and @xmath46 describes the interaction of the tip with the substrate .",
    "@xmath47 describes the tip which is assumed to have an unstructured density of states .",
    "the substrate with the adsorbed 3d atom may be modelled by a generalized anderson model that explicitly includes the orbital degeneracy of the 3d - orbital @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the energy level of an electron residing in the @xmath50 orbital of the adsorbate , @xmath51 creates an electron with spin @xmath52 , momentum @xmath53 and perpendicular projection of angular momentum , @xmath54 , in the metal .",

    "lineshapes are found to be somewhat asymmetric as a large part of the weight in situated at low energies in @xmath8 ( see also fig . [ fig1 ] ) . a weaker dependence of @xmath8 with the adsorbate - surface distance is obtained as compared to the jjj potential .",
    "the fact that we obtain reasonable lineshapes with a simple model such as a jellium with a step potential can be attributed to orthogonalization effects .",
    "tip - substrate matrix elements computed without orthogonalization corrections would increase rapidly with @xmath142 as they involve integrations over the whole space ( instead of the region close to the surface ) leading to rather asymmetric shapes of @xmath8 .",
    "there are two parameters that can be tuned to change the shape of the surface potential .",
    "one is the image plane position , @xmath110 , and the other is the sharpness of the surface potential given by @xmath106 .",
    "we fix @xmath184   and study the dependence of @xmath8 and lineshapes @xmath85 , with the sharpness of the potential barrier .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "we find that an increase in @xmath106 leads to a more asymmetric @xmath8 and the associated conductance lineshape , @xmath102 with more positive values of the fano parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "increasing @xmath106 makes the metal potential , @xmath66 , sharper so that the exponential tails of the metal wavefunctions outside the surface are shifted closer to the adsorbate leading to a stronger metal - adsorbate overlap .",
    "this is analogous to bringing the adsorbate closer to the surface for a fixed @xmath106 as discussed previously .",
    "hence , an increase in @xmath106 leads to an increase in the weight of @xmath8 at low energies and a sharper drop at energies above the fermi level .",
    "the stronger dependence found for @xmath8 with @xmath106 than with the adsorbate - substrate distance can be ascribed to the exponential dependence of @xmath66 with @xmath106 .",
    "summarizing , we find that lineshapes are strongly dependent on the degree of sharpness of the metal potential . making the surface potential sharper leads to more asymmetric lineshapes at typical atom - substrate adsorption distances .",
    "we finally discuss the dependence of conductance lineshapes when the tip is moved away from the adsorbate either laterally ( @xmath185 ) or perpendicularly .",
    "the tip position comes into our calculations through matrix elements , @xmath40 . a weak dependence of lineshapes with perpendicular tip - substrate distance , @xmath25 is found .",
    "varying the distance from 5 to 7   leads to a small change in the lineshape becoming slightly more asymmetric ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the weak dependence of the line shape on the tip - surface distance can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ matrixtip ] ) .",
    "this equation predicts a strong reduction of the amplitude of the conductance with vertical displacement of the tip @xmath186 , but no change in its shape .",
    "the weak dependence found is consistent with experimental observations which also indicate that the direct tip - adsorbate coupling is very small ( as expected from the localized nature of the d - orbital of the adsorbate ) .",
    "we can also analyze how lineshapes depend on the lateral position of the tip , @xmath23 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] which a rapid decay of the amplitude of the lineshapes is found .",
    "lineshapes are found to depend slightly on @xmath23 at tip - surface distances of about @xmath187   which is the typical experimental tip position . indeed",
    ", crystal wavefunctions with @xmath151 have the largest amplitude outside the surface representing electrons which have the largest probability of being detected by the tip ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for discussion ) . hence , the oscillatory behavior appearing in eq .",
    "( [ matrixtip ] ) is suppressed as only the states with small @xmath188 contribute to the momentum sums .",
    "the rapid decay of the amplitude with @xmath23 obtained from our calculations is consistent with the disappearance of the features in the conductance at distances of about @xmath189  .",
    "however , the small variation of the shape of the conductance with @xmath23 found is only partially consistent with experiments as for some systems such as co on cu(100 ) or co on au(111 ) lineshapes become gradually more symmetric ( @xmath190 ) at larger @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of co on au(111 ) , the lateral dependence of lineshapes depends not only on the modulus of @xmath191 but also on the _ direction _ in which the tip is moved @xcite from the adsorbate .",
    "this can not be described in the present framework as the surface corrugation is not included in our model .",
    "the finite size of the tip leads to a suppression of the tip - substrate matrix elements at large energies due to rapid oscillations of the metal wavefunctions providing a high energy cut - off .",
    "this cut - off turns out to be crucial to obtain reasonable lineshapes",
    ". had we used a point - like tip the amplitude of @xmath8 at energies below the vacuum level would be exponentially suppressed while above it large oscillations would occur .",
    "this is because wavefunctions are evaluated far from the surface ( at the tip position ) .",
    "hence , for a point - like tip the fano parameter would be very large ( @xmath192 ) and a peak rather than a dip would appear in conductance measurements .",
    "in the previous sections a detailed description of the method used has been provided . in the following we provide the reader with an application to conductance measurements of cu surfaces with co atoms deposited on them .",
    "copper surfaces are described using the parameters quoted in ref .",
    "[ ] for the analysis of surface states in noble metal surfaces . for cu surfaces we take @xmath193 @xmath147 and the adsorbate -substrate distance",
    "is estimated assuming hard spheres for the atoms.@xcite as the ( 111 ) surface is more closely packed than the ( 100 ) surface the co atom adsorbs at larger distances in the former than in the latter surface .",
    "this leads to @xmath194   and @xmath195   for the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces , respectively . at the temperatures used in the experimental studies of",
    "the conductance,@xcite co sits outside the cu(100 ) surface and it is not incorporated in the surface , as happens at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "ab initio calculations @xcite then give @xmath194  , in agreement with our simple estimate .",
    "we find that difference in the adsorbtion distance is enough to produce changes in the lineshapes as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . from the dependence of lineshapes with @xmath83 discussed above we find that for co on cu(100 ) surfaces lineshapes would be more asymmetric than for co on cu(111 ) .",
    "this is consistent with experiments performed for these two different surfaces.@xcite our result may be of more general validity and may apply to conductance measurements on other metal surfaces such as ag or au .",
    "however , care should be taken as our model contains the adsorbate - substrate distance only : corrugation effects may also be important .",
    "more experiments that systematically analyze the dependence of lineshapes for co on different crystal faces are needed to corroborate our findings .",
    "we have introduced an anderson model in an appropriate orthogonalized basis to analyze stm measurements of noble metal surfaces with adsorbed transition metal atoms .",
    "a realistic surface potential ( jjj potential ) , a single @xmath0 adsorbate orbital and a s - tip orbital are used to compute the parameters of the model . for typical values of the parameters characterizing the adsorbate - substrate interaction ,",
    "we find lineshapes with fano parameters , @xmath172 , in agreement with experimental trends .",
    "we have introduced a function @xmath8 which describes the adsorbate - substrate interaction .",
    "the description of experimental observations requires a @xmath8 which is fairly symmetric with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "since the underlying density of states is approximately parabolic and the matrix elements tend to further reduce @xmath8 at small @xmath100 , it is interesting that the model , nevertheless , gives reasonable shapes for @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the tip matrix elements play an important role .",
    "the tip wave function is rather extended , and matrix elements to continuum states at high energies are very small , due to the rapid oscillations of the continuum states over the spatial range of the tip wave function .",
    "this helps to make @xmath8 more symmetric around @xmath196 .",
    "we also find that it is essential to use substrate states which have been orthogonalized to the adsorbate and the tip .",
    "even when the realistic jjj potential is used , lineshapes are found to strongly depend on the sharpness of the surface potential controlled by @xmath106 becoming more asymmetric with increasing @xmath106 ( _ i .",
    "e. _ for sharper potentials ) . to a lower degree",
    "conductance lineshapes are also found to depend on the adsorbtion distance : the closer to the surface the adsorbate is the more asymmetric the lineshapes become .",
    "these tendencies can be explained from the enhancement in the coupling of the metal wavefunctions and the adsorbate at low energies together with the suppression at energies above the fermi level induced by the angular dependence of the @xmath0 orbital and the orthogonalization .",
    "more closely packed surfaces such as cu(111 ) are expected to lead to more symmetric lineshapes than the more open cu(100 ) faces as co adsorbs further out in the former than in the latter .",
    "we find good agreement with experiments comparing lineshapes of co on cu(100 ) with co on cu(111 ) surfaces . in agreement with experiments",
    "we also find that the tip - substrate distance does not strongly influence the shape of the conductance .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions about experiments with m. a. schneider and p. wahl and for pointing out to us several references .",

    "the decay is , however , somewhat slower than the exponential dependence : @xmath197 .",
    "this is because the tip wave function can be written as @xmath198 , valid for @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
