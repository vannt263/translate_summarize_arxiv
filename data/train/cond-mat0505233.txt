    "the history of the problem of the griffiths singularities starts from the theorem of lee and yang @xcite which states that the partition function of an ( ordered ) ferromagnetic ising model ( in any space dimensions and for any lattice connectivity ) as the function of the external magnetic field @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit has a continuous distribution of zeros along the imaginary axis of the _ complex _",
    "parameter @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , in the paramagnetic phase depending on the temperature this distribution starts at finite distance @xmath5 from the real axis , which means that here the free energy of the system is an analytic function of the _ real _ magnetic field @xmath0 ( with @xmath6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the temperature @xmath7 approaches the phase transition point @xmath8 from above the value of the interval @xmath5 shrinks to zero , so that the distribution of zeros touches the real axes at @xmath9 , which indicates ( in agreement with the modern theory of the critical phenomena ) that at the phase transition point the free energy must be a non - analytic function of ( real ) @xmath10 .",
    "now , if one would try to apply the above general observations for random systems , the consequences turn out to be much more tricky . as an example , let us consider bond diluted ferromagnetic ising model , in which the critical temperature @xmath11 is the ( decreasing ) function of the degree of dilution @xmath12 . here one can note that in an infinite system at a temperature @xmath7 which is above @xmath11 ( such that the state of the system is paramagnetic ) but below the critical temperature @xmath13 of the corresponding pure system , with a finite ( exponentially small ) probability there are exist arbitrary large less diluted ferromagnetic `` islands '' which are critical exactly at this given temperature @xmath7 . it is important that such clusters exist at any temperature in the interval @xmath14 .",
    "thus one can expect that the free energy of such random system must be a non - analytic function of the external magnetic field @xmath10 at _ any _ temperature between @xmath11 and @xmath13 , ref [ ] .",
    "unlike pure systems , however , here it is much more difficult to predict the explicit form of such non - analyticity .    for the one - dimensional diluted ising chain it has been shown that its free energy @xmath15 is non - analytic in the point @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and moreover the divergences of the pure system thermodynamics are replaced by an essential singularity at which all functions are finite and infinitely differentiable @xcite . according to further more general studies ( in terms of heuristic arguments @xcite and the bethe lattice systems @xcite ) ,",
    "the form of this singularity has been argued be of the type @xmath18 $ ] .    at the same time",
    "there has been much interest in the dynamical properties of such systems in the temperature interval @xmath14 .",
    "it has been discovered that the relaxation processes here are slower than the exponential @xcite .",
    "it turned out that due to the presence of rare large ferromagnetic clusters the relaxation of e.g. the order parameter takes either `` stretched - exponential '' form @xmath19 $ ] controlled by the temperature dependent exponent @xmath20 ( the result preferred by the numerical simulations @xcite ) , or even slower type of decay @xmath21 $ ] ( predicted analytically @xcite ) . due to these quite non - trivial dynamical properties , which are essentially different from the paramagnetic phase , the state of the system in this temperature interval",
    "is usually called the griffiths phase .    besides dynamics , an essential progress has been achieved in the analytical investigation of the distribution of zeros of the partition function alone the imaginary axis of the complex magnetic field . in particular , formal replica supersymmetric calculations performed for the random temperature ginzburg - landau hamiltonian @xcite",
    "has demonstrated the importance of the instanton - like off - perturbative excitations which provide the development of the `` tail '' in the distribution of zeros in analogy with the density of states in the anderson localization problem . on the other hand , the study of the diluted infinite - range ising ferromagnet with _",
    "finite _ connectivity in purely imaginary magnetic field @xmath22 has shown that in the paramagnetic phase the tail of the density of zeros @xmath23 has the explicit form of the type @xmath24 $ ] , where the function of the temperature @xmath25 vanishes in the critical point @xcite .",
    "similar tail has been also found numerically in the two - dimensional diluted ising model @xcite .",
    "all that , however , does nt answer the main question , what is the explicit form of the griffiths singularities of the thermodynamical quantities as the function of the _ real _ magnetic field in the point @xmath26 .    in this paper",
    "i am going to consider this problem in terms of the @xmath27-dimensional random temperature ginzburg - landau hamiltonian ( in dimensions @xmath3 ) in the paramagnetic phase away from the critical point . in the next section",
    "simple heuristic arguments will be proposed which demonstrate on a qualitative level the physical mechanism by which non - analytic contributions appear in the thermodynamical functions of such type of systems .",
    "after that , the systematic method of off - perturbative replica calculations will be formulated in section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv it will be demonstrated that non - analytic ( griffiths ) contributions to the thermodynamics comes from off - perturbative instanton - like excitations . in the limit @xmath1 such contributions to the free energy is argued to have the explicit form f ~ @xmath28 where the constant @xmath29 is defined by the parameters of the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian and by the strength of the disorder .",
    "before starting doing systematic calculations let us try to understand on a pure qualitative level , using simple `` hand - waving - arguments '' , what is the physical mechanism by which non - analytic contributions are coming into the free energy ( and others thermodynamical functions ) in the paramagnetic phase of weakly disordered ferromagnetic ising model in external magnetic field . let us suppose that such system in @xmath27 dimensions can be described by the continuous ginzburg - landau hamiltonian h = where the reduced temperature parameter @xmath30 is taken to be positive and sufficiently large to place the system into the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the disorder is modeled by a random function @xmath31 which is described by the gaussian distribution , p [ ] = p_0 ( -((x))^2 )  , where @xmath32 is the small parameter which describes the strength of the disorder , and @xmath33 is the normalization constant .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that non - trivial contributions to the thermodynamics are coming due to rare `` ferromagnetic islands '' in which the value of @xmath34 is on average bigger than @xmath30 .",
    "let us consider such an island , which is characterized by the linear size @xmath35 and the typical value of the `` local temperature '' @xmath36 its probability is exponentially small , @xmath37 ~ ( - l^d )  , and therefore such islands are well separated from each other and can be considered as non - interacting .",
    "note that the physical machanism of slowing down of the relaxational processes due to the presence of these ferromagnetic islands are more or less clear .",
    "the magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic cluster can be either `` up''or `` down '' , and if its size @xmath35 is big , then it would require a long `` elementary relaxation time '' @xmath38 to flip it from one orientation to the other ( since flipping of the cluster would require overcoming a big energy barrier , which is proportional to the volume of the cluster @xmath39 ) .",
    "the origine of the non - analytic contributions appearing in terms of pure statistical mechanics is much less clear : since time is formally infinite here , the presence of big energy barriers , separating the two orientations is irrelevant .",
    "first , let us consider what is going on in the zero external magnetic field . here",
    "one could distinguish two types of contributions to the thermodynamics :    \\(1 ) the perturbative one , coming from the spatial scales smaller than the correlation length @xmath40 , which formally could be computed e.g. in terms of the renormalization - group ( rg ) approach @xcite ;    \\(2 ) the non - perturbative contributions ( missing in the rg treatment ) due to the `` up '' and `` down '' ferromagnetic states of rare ferromagnetic islands discussed above , which are coming from the spatial scales bigger than the correlation length @xmath41 .",
    "it has to be noted that the island with small ( negative ) local temperature @xmath42 can be characterized as having the distinct ( mean - field ) `` up '' and `` down '' states only if its size is much bigger than its local correlation length @xmath43 in what follows we are going to use the mean - field values of the critical exponents assuming that the temperature of the system is taken sufficiently far away from the critical region near @xmath8 ( the size of this region is of the order of @xmath44 which is small if the coupling parameter @xmath45 is taken to be small ) .",
    "thus , with the exponential accuracy the ( griffith - like ) contribution to the free energy coming from these local ferromagnetic states can be estimated by their probability , eq.([gr4 ] ) :    f_g ~ _ 0^ d _ ( ) ^ dl @xmath46 ~ _ 0^ d @xmath47 here in the integration over @xmath48 the leading contribution comes from the vicinity of the saddle - point value _ * = ( which is positive in dimensions @xmath49 , and @xmath50 provided @xmath51 ) . in this way",
    "we obtain the following estimate for the off - perturbative contributions coming from rare locally ferromagnetic islands : f_g ~ @xmath52 in fact , this result ( including the value of the @xmath53 factor ) , as we will see in section iv , can be derived analytically in terms of the formal replica calculations as the contribution from the localized ( instanton - like ) solutions of the mean - field saddle - point equations @xcite .    in the presence of non - zero external magnetic field",
    "@xmath0 the situation becomes slightly more tricky .",
    "let us consider again the ferromagnetic island of the size @xmath35 with negative `` local temperature '' @xmath54 which is described by the hamiltonian , eq.([gr2 ] ) .",
    "note first of all , that the effective potential u ( ) = -^2 + g ^4 - h has two minima only if the value of @xmath48 is not too small , namely at > _ * ( h ) ~h^2/3 g^1/3 , otherwise , at @xmath55 , it has a unique minimum ( see fig.1 ) . in the case of the two minima , the state `` up '' ( @xmath56 ) has the lower energy @xmath57 , and it is the ground state of the island , while the state `` down '' ( @xmath58 ) can be considered as the excitation since it has higher energy , @xmath59 .",
    "the crucial point is that the excited state , @xmath60 disappears discontinuously at @xmath61 such that the energy difference @xmath62 remains finite at this critical value of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the contribution to the total free energy of such ferromagnetic islands can be estimated as follows :    , eq.([gr8 ] ) ) : ( a ) at @xmath63 ; ( b ) at @xmath64 ; ( c ) at @xmath61 . ]",

    "0^_*(h ) d p ( ) in the limit @xmath1 the first two terms in the above equation provide regular functions of @xmath0 ( both @xmath75 and @xmath76 go to zero as a power functions of @xmath0 in the limit @xmath10 ) , while the last one is just the non - trivial griffiths contribution @xmath77 which has the form of the essential singularity :    f_g ( h ) ~(2 ) _ 0^_*(h ) d p",

    "but first we have to formulate the general lines of the replica approach for the off - perturbative contributions .",
    "in this section i am going to formulate a general systematic approach for the calculations of off - perturbative contributions ( if any ) coming from local minima states , which in the configurational space are well separated from the ground state .",
    "let us consider a general random system described by a hamiltonian @xmath81 $ ] , and let us suppose that in addition to the ground state , there is another thermodynamically relevant ( griffith ) region of the configurational space located `` far away '' from the ground state and separated from it by a finite barrier of the free energy ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "in other words , we suppose that the partition function ( of a given sample ) can be represented in the form of two separate contributions : z = ( x ) e^-h = ^-f_0 + ^-f_1 z_0 + z_1 where @xmath82 is the contribution coming from the vicinity of the ground state , and @xmath83 is the contribution of the griffiths region .",
    "then , for the averaged over disorder total free energy we find : = - = - the second term here , which is just the griffiths contribution , can be represented as follows : f_g = - _ m=1^ = - _ n0 _",

    "namely , it is supposed that the saddle - point equations = 0 , ( a = 1 , ... , n ) have non - trivial solutions with the rsb structure _ a^*(x ) = \\ {    ll _ 1(x ) & +   + _ 0(x ) &    . with @xmath89 , so that the integration in the above partition function , eq.([gr22 ] ) , goes over fluctuations in the vicinity of these solutions : ^(1)_b(x ) & = & _ 1(x ) + _ b(x ) , ( b = 1 , ... , m ) ^(0)_c(x ) & = & _ 0(x ) + _ c(x ) , ( c = 1 , ... , n - m )    it should be stressed that to be thermodynamically relevant , the rsb saddle - point solutions , eq.([gr24 ] ) , should satisfy the following tree crucial conditions :    \\(1 ) the solutions should be _ local _ in space , so that they are characterized by _",

    "thus , in the systematic calculations one should find all saddle - point rsb solutions @xmath95 ( satisfying the above three requirements ) , eq.([gr24 ] ) , after that one has to compute their energies @xmath96 ( for @xmath97 ) , next one has to integrate over the fluctuations in the vicinity of these solutions , and finally one has to sum up the series    f_g = - _",

    "is to consider the eqs.([gr67 ] ) and ( [ gr68 ] ) for @xmath130 and @xmath118 much bigger than @xmath175 . in this case eq.([gr68 ] ) would require the values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 as the functions of @xmath130 and @xmath118 to be of order @xmath178 and @xmath179 , tending to zero as @xmath180 , while eq.([gr67 ] ) tells that both @xmath176 and @xmath177 must remain finite .",
    "thus , the summations in the instanton free energy contribution , eq.([gr32 ] ) , has to be limited by the finite value @xmath181 :    f_g(h ) = -v _ m = m_0^k_c _ k=0^m c^m_k - v _",
    "m = k_c^ _ k=0^k_c c^m_k ( here @xmath182 + 1 $ ] ) .",
    "this expression has to be compared with the corresponding summation at @xmath17 , studied in the previous subsection .",
    "although all the terms in these series are non - analytic functions of the disorder parameter @xmath32 ( see previous subsection ) , until @xmath183 , the difference between the terms with @xmath184 and the corresponding terms with @xmath17 can be represented in the form of corrections in powers of @xmath0 . on the other hand , as we will see below , the terms with @xmath185 are non - analytic functions of @xmath0 , and their differences with the corresponding zero - field contributions ( in particular the differences of the instanton energies ) can not be expended in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "it is these terms , which are the contributions of the critical instantons which yield the non - analytic in @xmath0 part of the free energy @xmath186 .",
    "rigorous extracting of this piece must be a very difficult problem ( it would require derivation of the instantons energy for arbitrary @xmath130 , @xmath118 and @xmath0 , as well as summations of the full series in eq.([gr74 ] ) ) , but with the exponential accuracy the form of this non - analytic singularity is defined only by the energy @xmath187 of the critical instanton , f_g(h ) ~ @xmath188 let us study the instanton configuration and estimate its energy in the vicinity of its critical state .",
    "for that let us rescale the fields , _ i = @xmath189 ^ 1/3 _",
    "i@xmath190 @xmath191 where = h^-1/3 g^-1/6 defines the spacial size of the critical instanton . in terms of the rescaled fields @xmath192 ,",
    "the energy of the instanton takes the form e(k , m ) = d^dz where u@xmath193 & = & @xmath194 - @xmath194 ^ 2 & + & @xmath195 - @xmath196 is the potential controlled by two rescaled parameters = ; = the instanton configuration is defined by the three equations , -_i + _ i + _ i^3 - _ i s = 1 ( @xmath110 ) where s = k_1 ^ 2 + ( m - k)_2 ^ 2 - m_0 ^ 2 let us consider these equations in the limit @xmath1 and and for the values of @xmath130 and @xmath118 of order of @xmath197 .",
    "there are two types of terms in eqs.([gr80 ] ) : ( 1 ) @xmath198 and @xmath199 which are both of order @xmath200 ; and ( 2 ) , the rest of the terms , which are of order of one . in the limit",
    "@xmath1 the diverging terms must balance each other : _",
    "i ~ @xmath201 _ i this condition is consistent with the requirement that both @xmath130 and @xmath118 are of the order of @xmath181 , eq.([gr73 ] ) . substituting these estimates into eqs.([gr77 ] ) , ( [ gr78 ] ) , for the energy of the instanton in its critical configuration we get e^(cr ) ~ h^-d/3 thus , with the exponential accuracy , the field dependent non - analytic part of the free energy has the following explicit form    f_g(h ) ~^-e^(cr ) ~@xmath202 which perfectly agree with the mean - field `` hand - waving '' estimate , eq.([gr18 ] ) .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that in deriving the above result we have neglected the effects of the critical fluctuations , which is justified only if we consider the system at temperatures not too close to the critical point , @xmath203 . in the close vicinity of @xmath8 , at @xmath204 , the situation becomes much more complicated : here one would have to combine the systematic ( renormalization - group ) integration over fluctuation with the background instanton solutions .",
    "in this paper the systematic approach for the off - perturbative calculations in disordered systems has been formulated ( section iii ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated how the proposed scheme works in the most simple but non - trivial case of weakly disordered ferromagnetic ising model away from its critical region . here",
    "the non - analytic ( as the functions of the disorder parameter and the external magnetic field ) contributions to the free energy has been derived , eqs.([gr62 ] ) , ( [ gr84 ] ) , and it has been demonstrated that in terms of the replica field theory such contributions appear due to instanton - like excitations . of course , it is hardly possible to register the presence of these exponentially small parts of the free energy both in real and in numerical experiments , and in this sense the present results has mostly pure theoretical interest . on the other hand , thinking about the others much more complicated problems of the statistical mechanics of disordered systems , the investigations made in this paper look rather promising . in particular , it does not look completely unrealistic to try to combine the present off - perturbative scheme with the renormalization - group treatment of the critical fluctuations , to settle down recent suspects @xcite that off - perturbative degrees of freedom could be quite relevant in the vicinity of the critical point , so that the nature of the phase transition in random ferromagnetic systems may appear to be not as simple as it was thought in early days of the theory of the critical phenomena in disordered materials . @xcite .",
