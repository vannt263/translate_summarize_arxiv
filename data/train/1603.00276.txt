    "current sheets are a common occurrence in laboratory and space plasmas .",
    "they appear as a local two - dimensional current concentration and they can be either the natural product of convective , often turbulent , plasma motion or the result of a plasma instability entering its non - linear stage .    in this work , we study the instability of generic current sheets , addressing the question of whether reconnection can be fast enough to account for the observed rates of common events such as the sawtooth crash in a tokamak and possibly solar flares .",
    "we consider a plasma characterised by a non - uniform average magnetic field @xmath3 , varying on a characteristic scale length @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of a current sheet is an almost planar current concentration of extension @xmath5 in two spatial dimensions and thickness @xmath6 . by definition ,",
    "the current density in the sheet would differ appreciably from the ambient current density .",
    "however one can argue , and it will be shown below , that such current concentration is unstable to fast growing perturbations .",
    "therefore the current density in the sheet @xmath7 can not exceed too much the ambient current density @xmath8 , and therefore one can reasonably assume @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , a current sheet would generally evolve in time .",
    "however , when studying its stability , it is convenient to assume it to be in a quasi - stationary state , if one is interested in instability growth rates much faster than the underlying evolution rate . as a consequence",
    ", a current sheet can be modelled as a planar system in local force balance . in the following ,",
    "we further assume that the ambient magnetic field is almost constant and that the current density in the sheet is almost aligned to it .",
    "the current in the sheet produces a magnetic field @xmath10 , which lays in the plane and it is transverse to the main magnetic field . from the previous estimate of @xmath7 one",
    "concludes    @xmath11    this scaling is certainly pertinent when the current sheet is the result of a large @xmath12 primary instability as in the case of the sawtooth phenomenon , which is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sawtooth ] . in this instance , scaling ( [ eq : current ] ) marks the transition to the nonlinear phase if @xmath13 is the linear layer width .",
    "therefore we are assuming that the current sheet becomes unstable to secondary instabilities at an early stage of the nonlinear evolution of the primary instability , a result we will find consistent with the estimates derived later in this work .",
    "note also that , by assuming this scaling of @xmath14 with the current sheet thickness , we depart fundamentally from previous works  @xcite , where the scaling @xmath15 is implicitly assumed",
    ". the implications of this different assumption are discussed more in detail in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "here we anticipate that _",
    "_ pucci and velli__@xcite pointed out that by increasing the current sheet aspect ratio , tearing mode theory predicts an increasing growth rate , reaching `` _ _ ideal tearing _ _ '' , or the the alfvnic limit , at a characteristic aspect ratio that depends on the regime considered@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the growth rate on the aspect ratio is exploited in an essential way also in the present work , as discussed later .",
    "moreover , the presence of a strong guide field @xmath3 allows one to treat the problem in the framework of reduced mhd . in this respect , we depart from the work of ref .  , where the guide field is assumed zero .",
    "in the following , we consider the resistive case , described by the model    @xmath16    @xmath17    written in terms of the normalised stream function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the electrostatic potential , and of the normalized magnetic flux function @xmath20 . here",
    "the current is given by @xmath21 , the velocity is @xmath22 and the magnetic field is @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the unit vector of the local ambient magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "moreover we have introduced the alfvn velocity @xmath26 and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath27 .",
    "the symbol @xmath28 refers to the parallel component with respect to the total magnetic field and @xmath29 refers to the components perpendicular to the local ambient field .",
    "their exact expression depends on the context and they will be later specified in the case of slab and cylindrical geometry .",
    "note that in eqs.([eq:1]-[eq:2 ] ) _ lengths and times still appear in dimensional units_.    in the following we first derive the scaling of fast reconnection in a general large aspect ratio slab ( sec.[rescaling ] ) .",
    "then , we apply the result to the sawtooth problem , by evaluating whether the sawtooth crash can result from the instability of the current sheet generated by a primary @xmath30 mode in a cylindrical tokamak ( sec.[sawtooth ] ) .",
    "in particular , we compare our conclusions with the existing numerical results ( sec.[secondary ] ) , and we analyse the transition to the non - collisional regime .",
    "we finally point out the difference with other works on fast reconnection , and we outline possible future work ( sec.[discussion ] ) .",
    "labelling with `` @xmath31 '' the equilibrium quantities and leaving the perturbations unlabelled , we start by linearizing eqs.([eq:1]-[eq:2 ] ) around an equilibrium with @xmath32 ( no flow ) , @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    adopting a local cartesian coordinate system ,",
    "we indicate with @xmath36 the coordinate perpendicular to the sheet , @xmath37 the direction of the transverse magnetic field @xmath14 and @xmath38 the direction of the ambient field @xmath3 . moreover , for the sake of simplicity one can assume a symmetric current distribution , such that @xmath39 at @xmath40 and two dimensional perturbations such that @xmath41 .    in the neighbourhood of @xmath40",
    "the parallel gradient operator takes the form @xmath42    we can now derive the scaling of the growth rate @xmath43 and of the inner reconnecting layer width @xmath44 in both the tearing ( labelled as `` @xmath45 '' ) and internal kink ( labelled as `` @xmath46 '' ) regimes .",
    "we recall that these regimes are identified by the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , where @xmath12 is the usual tearing mode stability parameter  @xcite .",
    "the scaling can be obtained , up to numerical constants , without carrying out the detailed asymptotic matching calculations , by taking @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 . moreover using the fact that @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the estimate @xmath53 , we obtain the following heuristic balance relations , respectively from eq.([eq : lin_1 ] ) ( l.h.s . and first r.h.s .",
    "term ) and from eq.([eq : lin_2 ] ) ,    @xmath54    these can be now specialised by estimating the perturbed current density respectively as @xmath55 for the internal - kink ( large-@xmath56 regime ) and as @xmath57 for the tearing mode ( small-@xmath56 , constant-@xmath58 regime ) .    introducing the macroscopic alfvn time @xmath59 and the lundquist number referred to the macroscopic scales @xmath60 , the following scaling is obtained :    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    note that these scalings do not depend explicitly on the current sheet thickness @xmath13 . however , in the tearing regime they do depend implicitly on @xmath13 via @xmath12 , which also brings in an additional dependence on the wavenumber .",
    "if the aspect ratio @xmath65 is sufficiently large so that many wave - numbers are excited , a fastest growing mode exists@xcite at the wavenumber @xmath66 corresponding to the transition between the tearing and the internal kink regime .",
    "this transition occurs when @xmath67 .    in order to see this",
    ", one has to specify the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 and @xmath68 .",
    "here we adopt the expression obtained for the harris  @xcite pinch for small @xmath69 , that is , well above the tearing instability threshold .",
    "@xmath70    note that the dependence @xmath71 of @xmath12 for small @xmath68 is fairly common and that , in any case , what follows can be easily generalised to a different@xcite power - law dependence .",
    "using eq.([eq : delta ] ) in eqs.([eq : slab_tear_delta],[eq : slab_kink_delta ] ) we obtain    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    as indicated in the introduction , the above results are of practical interest only if the underlying dynamics occurs at a rate lower than the estimate ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max ] ) .",
    "when the current sheet is the result of a large-@xmath12 primary instability of a quiescent plasma , the time scale of its dynamics can be obtained from ( [ eq : slab_kink ] ) by taking @xmath75 .",
    "this gives @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding layer width is an estimate of the current sheet width , @xmath77 .",
    "using this information one can estimate the maximum growth rate of the secondary instability from ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max ] ) :    @xmath78    which is clearly higher than the primary instability growth rate .",
    "one concludes that the current sheet of such primary instability will become quickly unstable , as soon as the primary current sheet becomes sufficiently thin .",
    "an application of this mechanism to the sawtooth crash will be given in the next section .",
    "more generally , current sheets occur as magnetic flux tubes are stretched and twisted by plasma advection . in an ideal plasma ,",
    "this mechanism produces thinner and thinner current sheets . in a turbulent plasma with comparable kinetic and magnetic energy ,",
    "the characteristic time is the alfvn time @xmath79 .",
    "therefore a current sheet will break up when its instability rate exceeds @xmath80 . from ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max ] ) one then deduces that the current sheet thickness must be of the order of :    @xmath81    note that this scaling is the same as the commonly quoted sweet - parker thickness .",
    "however the analogy appears only superficial .",
    "this thickness has been obtained here as the necessary condition for the break - up of a sheet formed by alfvnic motion rather than as the result of the nonlinear reconnection process .",
    "we now apply the above results to the @xmath83 internal kink ( ik ) instability * * ? ? ?",
    "* * in a large aspect ratio tokamak .",
    "the ik instability is considered an element of the sawtooth cycle@xcite , an almost periodic oscillation of plasma temperature characterised by a slow growth and a fast collapse . in the framework of resistive mhd",
    ", the ik instability is generally considered too slow to account for the observed fast sawtooth collapse , especially in weakly collisional plasmas@xcite , so that non collisional effects are called in to explain observations@xcite .    here",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we consider a sufficiently resistive plasma , so that the ik can be treated with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lin_1]-[eq : lin_2 ] ) , and we explore whether a secondary instability , possibly in the collisionless regime , can be fast enough to explain observations .      for the sake of clarity , in this subsection we review the key elements of the internal kink theory .",
    "we consider a large aspect ratio tokamak in the periodic cylindrical approximation for which the poloidal equilibrium magnetic field @xmath84 is much smaller than the toroidal one , herewith identified by @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt a set of cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath85 ) for the radial , poloidal and axial direction , respectively , with periodicity in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we also recall the expression of the safety factor :    @xmath88    where @xmath1 is the major radius , the cylinder length being @xmath89 . looking for perturbations of the form @xmath90 , @xmath91 , with the replacement @xmath92 and using the corresponding cylindrical expression for the parallel gradient operator @xmath93 we can write the outer equations of the boundary layer problem as    @xmath94\\ ] ]    @xmath95\\ ] ] and @xmath96",
    "one can see that , fixing @xmath30 and assuming a rational surface exists in the plasma at a position @xmath97 such that @xmath98 , the exact solution of this equation ( with vanishing boundary conditions ) for any @xmath99 and up to an amplitude is @xmath100 $ ] , @xmath101 , inside the @xmath102 surface , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 outside the @xmath102 surface .",
    "this implies that @xmath105 for these modes .",
    "the case @xmath106 is of interest for the sawtooth problem in a tokamak .    in the neighborhood of the point @xmath97 at which @xmath107 for @xmath83 , contained in the inner reconnecting layer of width @xmath44 , we can approximate @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the shear length in tokamak geometry , @xmath110 by definition and @xmath111 is the magnetic shear at @xmath102 .    by carrying out the same balance as in the slab , large-@xmath12 case ,",
    "one obtains    @xmath112    where in this instance the alfvn time and the lundquist number are defined using @xmath1 as a normalisation length .",
    "the above results are identical to the slab case by taking @xmath113 , @xmath114 and accounting for the change of normalisation length .      at the end of the linear phase , a current sheet develops around the @xmath115-point , having the form of an helical ribbon of helicity @xmath116 and radius @xmath97 . as a first approximation",
    ", we treat the problem as a planar sheet of width @xmath117 , given by the inner layer width of the primary mode @xmath83 . since at the end of the linear phase the perturbed current density is comparable to the equilibrium one@xcite",
    ", the magnitude of the transverse magnetic field in the current sheet , @xmath118 , can be estimated as    @xmath119    as the ik instability enters the nonlinear phase , the extension of the sheet , @xmath120 , would grow from a few times @xmath117 , to a a fraction of the circumference of radius @xmath97 ( e.g. , _ waelbroeck _ estimates@xcite it to be @xmath121 ) , so we assume @xmath122 .",
    "as the extension grows , higher and higher wave - numbers are progressively destabilised , with the smallest unstable wave - vector given by @xmath123 .",
    "we now adapt the results of the previous section to the present context . in the following we call @xmath124 the layer width of the secondary instability and @xmath125 the corresponding growth rate .",
    "for the regime tearing of the secondary mode we obtain    @xmath126    @xmath127    by estimating @xmath12 as in ( [ eq : delta ] ) , with @xmath13 replaced by the ik layer width @xmath128 , one obtains    @xmath129    @xmath130    the fastest growing mode has a wavenumber    @xmath131    which belongs to the available range as @xmath120 becomes comparable to @xmath97 .",
    "the corresponding maximum growth rate is    @xmath132    by integrating the reduced - mhd ( rmhd ) equations in cylindrical geometry , _ _ yu et al.__@xcite have found that the current layer generated by the nonlinear growth of a primary @xmath133 magnetic island becomes strongly unstable to secondary tearing modes .",
    "according to our calculation  ( [ eq : gamma_max_ii ] ) , in the secondary island regime , a weak positive dependence of the reconnection time on @xmath134 , @xmath135 , is expected .",
    "this appears consistent with the dependence shown in fig .  5 of _ _ yu et al.__@xcite ( black bullets ) .",
    "in many middle - size tokamaks , the rate given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_max_ii ] ) is probably fast enough to account for the observed evolution of the sawtooth crash . to assess the validity of the resistive model",
    ", one has to compare the predicted rate with the electron collision rate @xmath136 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath137 , where @xmath2 is the electron skin depth , and ignoring geometrical factors , one can consider two cases .",
    "for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kink_primary ] ) ( primary instability ) one requires @xmath138 , which can be recast as @xmath139    on the other hand , for the validity of eq .",

    "the three collisionality regimes are summarized in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] .    the effect of non - collisional physics can be evaluated by considering the model with electron inertia@xcite and adapting the estimates of sec .  [ rescaling ] .",
    "then , by using again @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slab_tear]-[eq : slab_kink_delta ] ) are replaced by    @xmath145    @xmath146    @xmath147    @xmath148    the growth rate and the layer width as a function of the wavenumber are sketched in log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ sketches ] for the collisional ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slab_tear]-[eq : slab_kink_delta ] ) with @xmath12 given by ( [ eq : delta ] ) ) and non - collisional regime ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slab_tear_ncoll]-[eq : slab_kink_delta_ncoll ] ) ) .    in the intermediate regime",
    "the situation with the two ( collisional and non - collisional ) estimates is summarized in fig .",
    "[ crossover ] .",
    "one can see that , apart from a range at the largest wave - numbers , the growth rate of the secondary instability is determined by non - collisional physics .",
    "in particular , the peak growth rate , occurring at the transition between ( [ eq : slab_tear_ncoll ] ) and ( [ eq : slab_kink_ncoll ] ) , scales like @xmath149 as one approaches the right boundary of the intermediate regime , the thickness of the primary layer decreases , we recall , as @xmath150 .",
    "thus the maximum growth rate of the secondary instability grows again as @xmath151 .",
    "this behaviour is also shown in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] . at the right boundary of this regime ,",
    "@xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "then the current sheet produced by the primary instability approaches the electron skin depth while _ the maximum growth rate of the secondary instability approaches alfvnic values_.    the growth rate  ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max_secondary_ncoll ] ) is fast enough to account for the observed sawtooth crash time in a machine like jet  @xcite .",
    "these observations call for a non - collisional theory since the observed rates are faster than the collision frequency . in this respect , referring again to fig .",
    "[ regimes ] , we notice that our approach brings the boundary , beyond which the collisionless effects matter , down to @xmath154 .",
    "this value of the lundquist number is much more easily achieved in large tokamaks than @xmath155 at which the primary instability enters the collisionless regime ( upper boundary of the intermediate regime ) .",
    "one can also remark that the reconnection rate has a minimum that scales like @xmath156 , in alfvn units , in all collisionality regimes .",
    "the results of _ _ yu et al.__@xcite have also been interpreted@xcite in terms of the _ _ plasmoid instability__@xcite .",
    "however , it appears that the literature on the plasmoid instability does not take into account the rescaling of the current sheet magnetic field with respect to its macroscopic , reference value ( eq.([eq : current ] ) ) .",
    "we recall that this is necessary to estimate correctly the size of the current sheet magnetic field at the end of the linear phase of a primary instability such as the @xmath83 mode in the sawtooth phenomenon .      by assuming that the width of the current sheet resulting from the primary instability scales like @xmath158 , as in this work , together with estimate  ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max_norescal ] )",
    ", one would conclude that the maximum growth rate scales like the _ ideal tearing _ growth rate @xmath159 , independent of resistivity .",
    "if on the other hand one assumed a narrower current layer scaling _  - la _ sweet - parker , @xmath160 , and at the same time one ignored the rescaling ( eq.([eq : current ] ) ) , thereby using again estimate  ( [ eq : slab_gamma_max_norescal ] ) , one would end up with a faster - than alfvnic estimate of the maximum growth rate @xmath161 .",
    "this seems the assumption adopted in the context of the _ plasmoid instability _",
    "theory  @xcite .    in the scenario where the current sheet is produced by a primary instability , as in the sawtooth case , we consider the results based on the _ ideal tearing _ and on the _ plasmoid instability _",
    "unlikely , since we have shown that the current sheet becomes sufficiently unstable to secondary sub - alfvnic modes at an earlier stage in its development and it would therefore likely break up before becoming sharper , in current concentration , or thinner , in width , than the estimates of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : current ] )  and  ( [ eq : slab_kink_delta ] ) , respectively .",
    "in summary , in this work we have shown that a current sheet generated by a primary instability , such as the internal kink mode , becomes sufficiently unstable at an early stage in its nonlinear development .    when applied to the context of the sawtooth phenomenon",
    ", the analysis of the secondary instability reveals that the sawtooth crash due to reconnection proceeds at a faster rate than previous estimates based on the primary @xmath83 internal kink mode  @xcite . in the case of a purely resistive model ,",
    "the reconnection rate depends weakly on the lundquist number , @xmath162 , and it appears in agreement with the results of numerical simulations at large lundquist number  @xcite .",
    "also , the value of the lundquist number at which collisionless effects become important is found to be substantially lower than the estimate based on the primary instability only .",
    "this broadens the range of tokamaks to which collisionless effects should be taken into account in the analysis of the sawtooth phenomenon . finally ,",
    "near - alfvnic reconnection rates can be achieved by secondary instabilities when collisionless effects become important also for the primary instability .",
    "detailed stability analysis of current sheets , taking into account the actual geometry , such as the @xmath30 ribbon , is a possibility to obtain more precise predictions about the maximum growth rate , the associated wavenumber , and the instability threshold .",
    "this might lead to an explanation of the lundquist number threshold observed in numerical simulations  @xcite and of the number of observed secondary islands .",
    "the effect of flows also merits an investigation . in this respect ,",
    "one notes that flows are small near the primary instability x - point , which is a stagnation point , but may be significant far from it , potentially leading to stabilising effects on the tearing mode@xcite and/or to additional instabilities such as kelvin - helmholtz s  @xcite .    finally , the stability analysis carried out in in this work is based on a magnetic configuration with the current aligned to a main magnetic field . relaxing this hypothesis and allowing for pressure gradients would open further possibilities .    the authors wish to thank q. yu for discussions about his work and a. tenerani for interesting discussions and for details about ref .. discussions with f. pucci and m. velli on the ideal tearing are also gratefully acknowledged ."
