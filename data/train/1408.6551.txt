    "the measurement of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of elementary particles is a crucial issue to particle physics .",
    "this is because for a nondegenerate system , as nucleus or an elementary particle , an edm is possible only if the symmetries under @xmath2 and @xmath3 are violated . on one hand , in the standard model ( sm ) framework",
    "the only source of @xmath2 and @xmath3 violation is the phase @xmath4 in the ckm mixing matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm prediction for the neutron electric dipole moment is @xmath5 cm @xcite , 6 orders of magnitude below the actual experimental limit of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the electron edm the sm prediction of @xmath7 @xcite and the experimental upper limit of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence , we see that in the context of the standard model the kobayashi - maskawa phase is not enough for explaining an edm with a value near the experimental limit for both electron and neutron .",
    "if the latter case is confirmed in future experiments , it certainly means the discovery of new physics with new @xmath3 violation sources .",
    "we can rewrite the experimental upper bound of the electron edm in units of borh magneton as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the particle responsible for the nonvanishing edm of a given particle . from eq .",
    "( [ bohr ] ) we obtain that @xmath11 gev .",
    "this naive calculation assumes that the electron edm arises only by the effect of a massive particle .",
    "notwithstanding , in a specific model the masses of the particles responsible for the edm may be much smaller than this value since it does not take into account the couplings of the responsible particle and negative interference if there are several of such particles .",
    "this is the case in electroweak models and , in particular , in the 3 - 3 - 1 ones . in the latter models there are many @xmath3 violating phases like the kobayashi - maskawa @xmath4 , but",
    "these are hard phases in the unitary matrices that relate the symmetry eigenstates and the mass eigenstates that , unlike in the sm , survive in some interactions among quarks , vector bosons and scalars .",
    "moreover , cosmology also hints that the sm may not be a complete description and that new @xmath0 violating phases must exist in models beyond the sm in order to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are led to explore alternatives to the sm ; in our case we consider the 3 - 3 - 1 model with heavy leptons ( 331hl for short )  @xcite .",
