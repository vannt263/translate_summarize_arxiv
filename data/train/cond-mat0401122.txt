    "[ anio2 ] ) .",

    "if there is a jahn  teller phase transition ( as in nanio@xmath0 ) , it lowers the crystal symmetry further , and makes the orbital ground state unique .",
    "an alternative would be to ascribe orbital polarization to an electronic phase transition due to orbital exchange , and to regard the lattice distortion as an induced secondary effect . in what follows ,",
    "we assume trigonal point group symmetry which is valid for nanio@xmath0 at high temperatures , and for linio@xmath0 at all temperatures . breaking the local trigonal symmetry ,",
    "whenever it happens , is ascribed to orbital ordering .",

    "the ni@xmath2 ions are in the @xmath8 low - spin state . in terms of the dominant cubic component of the crystal field @xmath9 .",
    "since the actual point group symmetry is trigonal , @xmath10 gets split into two levels ( @xmath11 , where standard notations for the irreps of the point group @xmath12 were introduced ) but this does not affect the fact that 6 electrons are taken up by closed subshells , and only the seventh electron is in an open subshell .",
    "the trigonal crystal field component changes the detailed nature of the @xmath13-states , but still allows for twofold orbital degeneracy : @xmath14 . in what follows ,",

    "the standard scenario seems to be ( at least nearly ) realized for nanio@xmath0 , which has a first order cooperative jahn - teller transition lowering the local symmetry from trigonal to monoclinic at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the remaining kramers degeneracy is lifted by a magnetic transition at @xmath17 , which was characterized as the antiferromagnetic ordering of ferromagnetic planes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , linio@xmath0 does not undergo a jahn  teller distortion@xcite , and though the measured susceptibility shows a number of anomalies , it does not seem to develop magnetic long range order @xcite .",
    "it is puzzling that the two isostructural and isoelectronic compounds show so different behavior .",
    "naturally , it is always possible that some of the observed behavior is not intrinsic .",
    "impurities and structural defects are likely to prevent orbital ordering .",
    "indeed , it was suggested that only nanio@xmath0 allows the growth of sufficiently good - quality samples , and the observation of ordering transitions , while the overall behavior of linio@xmath0 is like that of the high - temperature phase of nanio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the contrasting features of nanio@xmath0 and linio@xmath0 appear naturally as nearly equivalent possibilities for the intrinsic behavior of spin - orbital models of the trigonal @xmath15 doublet .",
    "a similar four - state model , namely the @xmath8 cubic @xmath18 doublet on the cubic lattice , has been studied in great detail in the context of manganite physics@xcite .",

    "orbital models do not need the fine - tuning of the lattice structure to get frustration effects , we find that the geometrical frustration of the triangular planes of the linio@xmath0 structure brings essential new features .",
    "for this reason , we consider only an isolated triangular plane , and discuss @xmath19 behavior only .",
    "we assume that our essential conclusions would carry over to the @xmath20 behavior of coupled planes .",
    "the idea that the geometrical frustration of the triangular lattice tends to oppose ordering , has been discussed for spin@xcite and orbital@xcite degrees of freedom separately . in a pioneering work ,",
    "hirakawa et al.@xcite started a systematic investigation of triangular lattice antiferromagnets with the explicit aim of finding non - nel - type behavior .",
    "this work initiated the intensive re - investigation of linio@xmath0 . on the theoretical side ,",

    "orbital model su(4 ) symmetrical , it was found that the ground state of the nearest - neighbour model on the triangular lattice is an su(4)-resonating quantum liquid@xcite .",
    "here we consider the full range of @xmath15 models , restricting the parameters only by the requirements dictated by symmetry .",
    "the pair interaction is generically of su(2)@xmath21 symmetry ; higher symmetries ( su(2)@xmath22su(2 ) or su(4 ) ) follow from specific choices of the parameters .",
    "we explore many lower - symmetry states in addition to the fully symmetrical su(4 ) phase . accepting that the observed behavior of both linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0 is intrinsic , any theory for why linio@xmath0 does not order should also allow for the alternative scenario of orbital and spin ordering , as observed in nanio@xmath0 . in terms of our trigonal @xmath15 model ,",
    "we show that the combination of geometrical frustration with the dynamical frustration inherent in spin - orbital models gives rise to a rich variety of competing states stretching from the su(4 ) resonating singlet state to spin - ferromagnetic phases with various orbital order . we will find it natural that contrasting behavior resembling that of either linio@xmath0 or nanio@xmath0 can arise in nearby regions of parameter space .",

    "as anticipated , the su(4 ) physics extends to a finite and relatively large portion of the phase diagram , and it can in principle be relevant for real systems . since our mean - field approach does not lead to any physical insight beyond the determination of the boundary of this phase however , we will not discuss it further here .      from the magnetic point of view , this phase consists essentially of weakly coupled , antiferromagnetic chains ( see fig .  [ phases ] ) , while the orbital structure turns out to be rather subtle with an antiferro - orbital arrangement of ferro - orbital chains with orbitals which are neither pure @xmath245 nor @xmath246 but alternate between @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "the detailed magnetic structure depends _ a priori _ on the residual couplings between the chains .",
    "if the couplings are equal in both residual directions , some canting will presumably develop inside the chains to accomodate the frustration , like in the limiting case of the 180 degree classical ground state of the heisenberg model on the triangular lattice .",
    "this effective magnetic hamiltonian would be similar to that realized in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath249 , with possibly spinon excitations as reported by coldea et al@xcite .",
    "if however the symmetry is broken between the residual directions , the system is expected to develop rather collinear order , with lines of parallel spins along the direction of the most ferromagnetic or least antiferromagnetic residual coupling .",
    "for all parameters , the residual couplings predicted by the mean - field solution are very small , but their sign and symmetry depends on the parameters .",
    "they tend to be af for small @xmath250 and ferromagnetic for large @xmath250 , and the symmetry between the two directions may or may not be broken depending on the parameters . while this interesting point would deserve further investigation , we do not think that a reliable answer to such a subtle issue can be obtained just on the basis of this mean - field decoupling , and we do not discuss the point further .",

    "the mean - field approach has a very remarkable property however : in addition to the mean - field solutions with lowest energy shown in fig .  [ phases ] , there are several other mean - field solutions of the self - consistent equations with energies very close to the lowest energy corresponding to other dimer coverings of the triangular lattice . in such circumstances , going beyond mean - field is likely to couple these solutions , and the relevant model would then be a quantum dimer model describing resonances between these states . as we shall see below , this point of view",
    "is favoured by exact diagonalizations of finite clusters .",
    "so at that stage we think it is safer to think of these phases as a region of parameters where all dimer coverings are relevant states for low - energy physics .",

    "as can be seen from the energy levels , the @xmath266 state is present in the ` ground - state manifold ' of all the ordered phases .",
    "therefore we identified the phase boundaries by level crossings of the ` ground - state manifolds ' associated with each type of ordering , which agree reasonably well with the classical phase boundaries ( @xmath297 ) . at these phase boundaries continuous degeneracies",
    "appear in the classical wave function , suggesting a gapless excitation spectrum at those points .",
    "due to the small number of conveniently exploitable symmetries in the problem ( we have only the spin su(2 ) symmetry ) , the size of the hilbert space grows very rapidly with the size . in the @xmath298 sector",
    "it increases like @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the number of sites .",
    "this limits us to small cluster sizes , especially if we want to explore the phase diagram .",
    "the obvious choice was the 12-site cluster with periodic boundary conditions ( fig .",
    "[ clust ] ) , which has the full point @xmath12 symmetry of the lattice as well .",

    "the fully polarized ferromagnetic region ( @xmath301 ) is found for very similar values of @xmath212 . for small @xmath212 ,",
    "we identify 5 different regimes from @xmath182 to @xmath302 .",
    "they seem to correspond to 4 phases only since two regions join for intermediate values of @xmath212 , but given the difficulty to determine phase boundaries from exact diagonalizations , this should not be taken too seriously .",
    "the various regions are labelled according to the point in the brillouin zone where the ground state is found .",
    "exact diagonalizations : phase diagram for the 12-site cluster ]    in the vicinity of the su(4)-point ( @xmath303,@xmath304 ) , the low - lying spectrum is similar to the one obtained in the su(4 ) case@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the description of the ground state in terms of su(4 ) singlets is applicable in this region .    at the @xmath282 point",
    "the ground state is three - fold degenerate .",
    "this could correspond to the formation of af chains in phase b since these chains can form in three directions , resulting in a 3-fold degenerate mean - field solution . to confirm this interpretation",
    ", we have diagonalized the full hamiltonian in the variational sub - space spanned by the mean - field ground state wave -functions of phase b. it turns out that these states are not coupled because , due to the orbital configuration , they have different symmetries with respect to the inversion around the middle points of nearest - neighbour bonds .",
    "so the ground - state degeneracy in this variational subspace is still equal to 3 , supporting the interpretation in terms of chains .",
    "when the ground - state is at the @xmath305 point , the interpretation is not so straightforward .",
    "the ground state is strictly speaking twofold degenerate . but looking at the spectra the first excited state is at the @xmath284 point , and very close to the ground state . a possible explanation could be that all these states are degenerate in the thermodynamic limit.then this region could also be explained by the formation of chains . to check this point , we have diagonalized the hamiltonian in the variational sub - space spanned by the three mean - field ground state wave -functions of phase d. the orbital configuration is different from phase b , and the degeneracy is partially lifted , with a two - fold degenerate ground - state an a non - degenerate excited state . again",
    "the agreement supports the interpretation of this phase in terms of af chains .",
    "the most interesting region for our case is the central one .",
    "we will focus our attention on the line @xmath306 . along this line",
    "we will see that a description in terms of rvb states is reasonable .",
    "for instance , the low - lying spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) for @xmath307 and @xmath306 , shows a very large number of singlets states ( 125 ) before the first triplet ( at the top of the figure ) .",
    "all these singlets are very close in energy , the energy difference between the ground state and the first triplet being of the order of @xmath308 .",
    "note that the number of singlets below the first triplet ( 125 ) is a significant fraction of the total number of dimer - coverings for this 12-site cluster ( 348 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the spectrum found by lecheminant et al for the s=1/2 heisenberg model on the _ kagome _ lattice@xcite .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the mean - field results .",
    "indeed , in phases c and c , several solutions corresponding to various dimer coverings were found with comparable energies ( see fig .  [ dimpat ] ) .",
    "a similar observation was made in a preliminary study of a similar spin ",
    "orbital model in the context of bavs@xmath73@xcite .    a possible ground state for",
    "this region could be a spin ",
    "orbital version of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state@xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure could be envisaged as a fluctuating pattern of bonds among different dimer - coverings or a mixture between dimer - coverings and chains .",
    "all these states being singlets , they may be degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us also mention that there is also a partially polarized region @xmath309 .",
    "we suspect that it may be a finite - size effect , as it is greatly reduced with respect to the corresponding @xmath194 phase present in the phase diagram of the tetrahedron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag4 ] ) .",
    "two stable states for a 12-site cluster : the dashed line represents the cluster . @xmath306 and @xmath307 ]     two stable states for another 12-site cluster : the dashed line represents the cluster . @xmath306 and @xmath307 ]",
    "in transition metal oxides , the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath144 is typically in the range 4 - 10 ev , and the hund s rule coupling in the range 0.5 - 1 ev , leading to a physical range defined by @xmath311 .",
    "interestingly enough , all phases appear in this range and should be possible to observe in actual compounds provided the ratio @xmath175 has the appropriate value . in that respect , one should emphasize that the phase diagram depends only on the hopping integrals between orbitals , not on the actual orbitals . in particular ,",
    "even if the two orbitals were not orthogonal by symmetry on one of the bonds , diagonalizing the hopping matrix on a given bond would bring us back to the situation treated in this paper .",
    "so the discussion would carry over beyond the specific case of @xmath251 and @xmath312 up to the remarks dealing with jahn - teller distortions .",
    "now , coming back to linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0 , hence to @xmath251 and @xmath312 orbitals , simple arguments suggest that @xmath175 is _ negative _ and _ small_. that it is negative comes from the different symmetries of the orbitals : the @xmath251 orbitals on edge - sharing octahedra ( see fig .",
    "2 ) are symmetric with respect to the mirror plane that brings one octahedron into the other , while the @xmath312 are antisymmetric .",
    "now any direct overlap between @xmath13 wave functions in transition metal oxides is known to be very small .",
    "however one should not forget that the orbitals are in fact wannier functions centered on the transition metal ions which extend in general to infinity to insure orthogonality , and which have a significant weight on neighbouring o @xmath313 orbitals . in the case of the wannier orbitals with symmetry",
    "@xmath312 , this does not lead to any significant transfer because the o @xmath313 orbitals coupled to one of them are orthogonal to the @xmath312 of the neighbouring octahedron .",
    "this is not strictly true here since the ni - o - ni angle is not exactly 90@xmath4 , and also because the crystal field is not symmetric at the oxygen site , but still one expects the effective hopping to be very small .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath251 wannier orbitals have weight on the o @xmath313 orbitals above and below , and these o @xmath313 orbitals have a standard @xmath37 overlap regardless of the actual local distortions of the octahedra .",
    "so this should give rise to a significant overlap between the wannier functions with @xmath251 symmetry .    beyond the actual value of the parameters , it is important to emphasize that we have not adopted the same point of view as mostovoy and khomskii  @xcite , who have neglected any overlap between ni orbitals , although it is allowed by symmetry .",
    "further , they have assumed that ni - o - ni bonds make and angle of 90@xmath4 , although the actual angle is around 94@xmath4 in linio@xmath0 and 96.4@xmath4 in nanio@xmath0 , and they have neglected the role of crystal field at the oxygen site , known to produce antiferromagnetic couplings as shown by dar et al  @xcite . while the ferromagnetic coupling that comes out of these approximations is certainly relevant , the simplified hamiltonian studied by mostovoy and khomskii leads to a purely ferromagnetic coupling , while the more general hamiltonian studied in the present work exhibits a rich variety of phases which , we believe , might actually lead to the ultimate explanation of linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0 .      in the case of linio@xmath0 , which undergoes neither a jahn - teller distortion nor a magnetic phase transition upon lowering the temperature",
    ", we have to choose between two different realizations of rvb : the su(4 ) phase a ( for @xmath314 ) , and the fluctuating dimer phases c and c. since we have argued that @xmath315 , we opt for the dimer phases .",
    "actually , one should give preference to phase c since @xmath175 is negative , but as we discussed these phases should better be considered as defining a domain in which the physics of the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) on the triangular lattice might be relevant .",
    "the actual form of the effective qdm is not known yet , but it presumably will not be too far from the minimal model studied by moessner and sondhi  @xcite since phase c is a staggered state and belongs to the ground state manifold of their model for large engouh repulsion between face - to - face dimers , while phase c is a maximally flippable state and belongs to the ground state manifold in the limit of infinite attraction between face - to - face dimers .",
    "note however that phase c is _ not _",
    "the columnar state realized for finite attraction in the minimal model , so differences are to be expected .",
    "still , close to the boundaries between the phases , one may speculate that an rvb phase will be present .",
    "such a phase does not break any symmetry and could explain the absence of any kind of ordering in linio@xmath0 .",
    "let us also note that the exafs results by rougier et al  @xcite are also consistent with this proposal since the orbitals entering all these states are jahn - teller orbitals with two long bonds and four short bonds .",
    "if the system undergoes resonances between different states , this would produce a dynamic jahn - teller effect between these states , a situation still leading to two long bonds and four short bonds on average .",
    "due to some disorder , and/or to coupling to the lattice , the system might actually prefer to freeze in a non - periodic dimer covering of the triangular lattice , as suggested by reynaud et al  @xcite .",
    "such a frozen , non - periodic state would also be consistent with the results of ref .",
    "[  ] .      as far as nanio@xmath0 is concerned , the only potential candidate is phase d since this is the only ferro - orbital phase with jahn - teller orbitals consistent with the distortion that occurs at 480 k in that system .",
    "this phase has the largest boundary with phase c , a good point in view of the very similar structures of linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0 .",
    "as stated earlier , the effective model consists of weakly coupled af chains , and the resulting magnetic structure will depend on the residual couplings .",
    "a thorough analysis of this point will require to go beyond the present calculation and is left for future investigation .",
    "but in any case , with some interlayer coupling , this is expected to lead to some kind of af ordering at finite temperature , in agreement with experiments .",
    "let us emphasize that , while simultaneous ferromagnetism _ and _ jahn - teller active ferro - orbital order have been argued to be possible by mostovoy and khomskii  @xcite in the context of their simplified model , this seems to be impossible in the context of our microscopic model .",
    "now , as far as experiments are concerned , the actual order is not known yet .",
    "it has been often assumed so far that this af state consists of ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically , but new , preliminary results seem to indicate that this can not be the case  @xcite , which opens the way for another type of antiferromagnet .      at this stage ,",
    "the essential problem when comparing our predictions to the experimental data for linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0@xcite is the sign of the curie - weiss constant , which is a measure of the average coupling . in both cases , it is ferromagnetic if determined at not too high temperature@xcite , while in our calculation , it is antiferromagnetic .",
    "this is not a very serious problem however . in deriving our model ,",
    "we have only kept second order terms in the hopping @xmath46 and @xmath198 between wannier orbitals centered at ni sites .",
    "this derivation , exactly similar to the derivation of kinetic exchange , neglects the ferromagnetic coupling that is always present due to the overlap of these wannier functions .",
    "the precise form of this ferromagnetic coupling in the context of extended wannier functions centered at the nickel site , which is the point of view adopted in the present paper , has not been derived yet but it is expected to be similar to the form derived by mostovoy and khomskii . in any case , we have checked that if we include an _ ad hoc _",
    "ferromagnetic term ( the b term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effham3ph ] ) ) @xmath316 to the hamiltonian ( @xmath317 ) , the phases discussed above remain stable in a region where the curie - weiss constant is ferromagnetic .",
    "more precisely , we have solved the self - consistent equations including such a term , which leads to the effective spin hamiltonian : @xmath318 where @xmath319 , and the curie - weiss constant is given by : @xmath320 where @xmath321 means summation over all first neighbours of a a given site @xmath322 , while @xmath323 means summing over three pairs of nearest - neighbours in three inequivalent directions .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ hvst ] .",
    "as announced , the curie - weiss temperature changes sign inside phases c and d before one enters the ferromagnetic phase , and this occurs for values of @xmath324 which are small enough to be physically relevant .    @xmath325 as a function of @xmath324 for c and d phases ( see fig .",
    "[ var - dia ] ) : @xmath326 and @xmath327 for the solid line ( d phase ) , @xmath328 for the dashed line ( c phase ) ]",
    "we have shown that a spin - orbital model on the triangular lattice with realistic parameters leads to a very rich physics .",
    "the presence of various important phases ( su(4 ) , dimers and ferromagnetic ) is confirmed for every cluster ( 4 , 12 and 16 sites ) .",
    "moreover it seems that this model is able to provide a good description of the behaviour of linio@xmath0 and nanio@xmath0 , and to explain the puzzling difference between these two compounds .",
    "we have given specific meaning to the claim that an rvb state seems to be at the origin of the magnetic properties of linio@xmath0 .",
