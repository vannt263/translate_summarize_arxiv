    ", is a very important aspect of heavy - ion physics .",
    "one of the important quantity which has been used extensively to study this hot and dense nuclear matter is the collective transverse in - plane flow @xcite .",
    "this quantity has a beauty of vanishing at a certain incident energy .",
    "this energy is dubbed as balance energy ( @xmath1 ) or the energy of vanishing flow ( evf ) @xcite .",
    "this beauty is due to the counterbalancing of attractive mean - field at low incident energies and repulsive nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions at higher incident energies .",
    "the balance energy of the masses ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 at different colliding geometries was studied experimentally and theoretically and found to be sensitive with the composite mass of the system @xcite as well as with the impact parameter of a reaction @xcite .",
    "+ with the passage of time , isospin degree of freedom in terms of symmetry energy and nn cross section is found to affect the balance energy or energy of vanishing flow and related phenomenon in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "+ experimentally , pak _ et al . _ , studied the isospin effects on the collective flow and balance energy at central and peripheral collision geometries @xcite . on the other hand , theoretically , this effect is studied by using the isospin - dependent boltzmann uehling - uhlenbeck model ( ibuu ) @xcite , and isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) model @xcite . + as noted , balance energy is due to the counterbalancing of the attractive mean - field and repulsive nucleon- nucleon collisions .",
    "the coulomb interaction in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions is expected to play a dominant role in balance energy due to its repulsive nature .",
    "these effects are supposed to be more pronounced in the presence of isospin effects @xcite . the comparative study which will show the shift in balance energy due to coulomb interactions in the presence of isospin effects by taking into account asymmetry of reaction in a controlled fashion is still missing in the literature .",
    "the second point is the asymmetry of the reaction . in some of the studies ,",
    "the asymmetry of a reaction is taken into care , but not in other , which is very important to study the isospin effects @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the reaction can be defined by the parameter @xmath4 ; where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the masses of target and projectile .",
    "the @xmath7 = 0 corresponds to the symmetric reactions , whereas , non - zero value of @xmath7 define different asymmetry of the reaction .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the reaction dynamics in a symmetric reaction ( @xmath7 = 0 ) can be quite different compared to asymmetric reaction ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the deposition of excitation energy in the form of compressional energy and thermal energy in symmetric and asymmetric reactions , respectively .",
    "the effect of the asymmetry of a reaction on the multifragmentation is studied many times in the literature @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , very little study is available for the asymmetry of the reaction in terms of transverse in - plane flow .",
    "+ in this paper , we will perform the first ever study for the balance energy in terms of asymmetry of the reaction and then observe the effect of coulomb interactions , symmetry energy , equations of state as well as different frame of references . the iqmd model used for the present analysis",

    "one of its version ( qmd ) , has been very successful in explaining the subthreshold particle production @xcite , multi - fragmentation @xcite , collective flow @xcite , disappearance of flow @xcite , and density temperature reached in a reaction @xcite .",
    "we shall not take relativistic effects into account , since in the energy domain we are interested , there is no relativistic effect @xcite .",
    "the isospin degree of freedom enters into the calculations via both cross sections , mean field and coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the details about the elastic and inelastic cross sections for proton - proton and neutron - neutron collisions can be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "the nucleons of the target and projectile interact via two and three - body skyrme forces and yukawa potential .",
    "the isospin degrees of freedom is treated explicitly by employing a symmetry potential and explicit coulomb forces between protons of the colliding target and projectile .",

    "standard skyrme - type parameterizations is employed .",
    "the skyrme energy density have been shown to be very successful at low incident energies where fusion is dominant channel @xcite .",

    "the inclusion of coulomb interactions does not alter the conclusions .",
    "note that the increase in the asymmetry is related with the increase in the n / z ratio . because the symmetry potential for the neutron rich systems is stronger compared to the neutron poor systems due to large relative neutron strength .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry potential is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons . on the other hand ,",
    "more negative value of directed flow ( dominating the mean field ) is observed in the absence of coulomb interactions in center of mass as well as in lab .",

    "this is due to the well known fact of increase in the frequent nn collisions with increase in the incident energy @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the directed flow with asymmetry of a reaction follows the opposite trend at e = 50 mev / nucleon as compared to other high incident energies .",
    "it has been discussed many times in literature and also clear from the present findings that attractive mean - field is dominating at e = 50 mev /nucleon compared to higher incident energies under consideration @xcite .",
    "this is due to the different mechanisms contributing at low and high incident energies within isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics .",
    "it was shown by us as well as by others @xcite that symmetry potential dominates the physics at low incident energy , while , nn cross sections one major driven force at higher incident energies .",
    "furthermore , at low incident energies , symmetry potential is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons . with the increase in the asymmetry of a reaction ,",
    "the number of neutrons increases and hence comparative repulsion due to neutrons also increases leading to less attractive value of the flow .",
    "it is also clear from ref .",
    "@xcite , that with the increase in asymmetry of a reaction , the participant zone decreases and spectator zone increases . at higher incident energies , where the effect of symmetry energy is negligible",

    "hence directed flow is found to be less positive with increase in the asymmetry of the reaction .",
    "the directed flow has less positive value with soft equation of state compared to hard equation of state .",
    "the less positive means the dominance of mean - field .",

    "we have displayed here the results upto 250 mev / nucleon , since we are interested in and around balance energy . in the presence of coulomb interactions , more positive value of the flow is obtained .",

    "<S> we aim to understand the role of coulomb interactions as well as of different equations of state on the disappearance of transverse flow for various asymmetric reactions leading to same total mass . for the present study , </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of the system is kept constant ( @xmath0 = 152 ) and asymmetry of the reaction is varied between 0.2 and 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contribution of mean - field at low incident energies is more for nearly symmetric systems , while the trend is opposite at higher incident energies . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interactions as well as different equations of state are found to affect the balance energy significantly for larger asymmetric reactions . </S>"
