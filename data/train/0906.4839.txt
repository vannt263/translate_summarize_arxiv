    "in the cold dark matter framework , large spiral galaxies are built hierachically , and there is much observational evidence of galaxy interactions to support this .",
    "however , we still face many challenges in understanding the details of galaxy evolution . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to study the hot , massive stellar populations in nearby galaxies which can be a robust tracer of recent star formation activity due to their short lives .",
    "young massive stars contribute to the global characteristics at the current epoch of their host galaxy and have a major role in the galaxy evolution .",
    "young massive stars emit powerful ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , therefore uv imaging is ideal to detect and characterize these stars , which are confused with older stellar populations in observations at longer wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in most cases ,",
    "young massive stars are formed in associations in the galactic disk .",

    "specifically , the integrated fuv @xmath9 nuv color of young stellar populations is very sensitive to the age of the population , owing to the rapid evolution of the most massive stars ( e.g. bianchi 2007 , 2009 :  fig .",
    "consequently , uv imaging data allow us to unambiguously identify the young stellar populations and to estimate their ages and masses from colors and extinction - corrected uv luminosities , respectively .",
    "these results provide the means of probing the history and modality of recent star formation in galaxies .",
    "m31 is one of the two largest spiral galaxies in the local group , along with the milky way .",
    "however , there has been growing evidence that the milky way and m31 have different properties ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "m31 shows a lower star formation rate ( sfr ) than the milky way @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are suggestions that m31 appears to be a more typical spiral galaxy than the milky way @xcite . as with the bulk of local spirals , m31 shows evidences for a formation and evolution history affected by merging and/or accretion events , including substructures in its halo (",
    "* and references therein ) . in this respect ,",
    "it is important to investigate the star - forming ( sf ) regions in m31 .",
    "we present the first extensive study of the young stellar populations from uv imaging , covering the entire m31 disk within 26 kpc radius , and extending beyond this radius in some fields . by studying the sf regions in m31 traced by uv imaging",
    ", we investigate the recent star formation history of this galaxy .    in section 2 , we describe the _ galex _ uv data used .",
    "we describe the detection and photometry of sf regions , from uv imaging , in section 3 , and estimate their interstellar extinction in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we select ob associations from ground - based photometry of stellar sources and compare them with our uv - defined sf regions . the age and mass of the sf regions",
    "are derived in section 6 , the star formation history in section 7 , and the conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "we focus on the disk region of m31 where most of the recent sf regions are located .",
    "we adopt the disk semi - major axis value of r = 26  kpc from @xcite .",
    "we considered 20 fields from the _ galex _ fourth data release ( gr4 ) .",
    "_ galex _ observed the disk region of m31 as part of the nearby galaxies survey ( ngs , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we rejected the fields which have only fuv observations and exposure time shorter than 2,000  s ( except for  ps_m31_mos03 \" ) , then selected the fields closer to the major axis when different pointings are located along the galaxy s major axis .",
    "ps_m31_mos03 \" field has a shorter exposure than 2,000  s but it is the only _ galex _ field observed in the south outermost disk region of m31 . as a result , we selected 7 _ galex _ fields covering the entire disk region ( see fig . 1 and table 1 ) .",
    "each selected _ galex _ field has fuv ( 1344 - 1786   ) and nuv ( 1771 - 2831   ) imaging with the same exposure time .",
    "_ galex _ fuv and nuv imaging has 4.2 and 5.3  arcsec resolution ( fwhm ) or about @xmath319  pc in m31 , and the field of view ( fov ) is about 1.27 and 1.25 degree respectively @xcite .",
    "we used in our analysis only the central 1.1  degree diameter portion of the field , for best photometry .",
    "_ galex _ images have a sampling of 1.5  arcsec  pixel@xmath8 which corresponds to 5.67  pc , assuming a distance of 785  kpc @xcite .",
    "the fuv images provide a direct measure of the flux from young massive stars not heavily embedded in interstellar dust .",
    "most sf regions are gravitationally unbound systems and have irregular shapes . rather than using aperture photometry , we constructed contours of the sf regions to trace their morphology , and measure their uv flux and flux density .",
    "the procedure was originally developed by @xcite in his dissertation , and we have modified the procedure for a more precise detection and photometry of the sf regions . our procedure consisted of three steps .",
    "the first step was to detect all image pixels which have flux above a certain threshold in each fuv image .",
    "an important factor in detecting and defining sf regions is the brightness limit .",
    "the second step was to define the contours of each sf region from contiguous pixels detected above the threshold over a minimum area . in this way",
    ", we can define contours of sf regions even if they have a complicated shape , and reject isolated stars which are smaller than the minimum size .",
    "the third step was to estimate the background and to measure the flux of the defined sf regions .",
    "even though the background in the uv image is much lower than in the optical , it is important to correctly subtract its contribution from the source photometry .",
    "we performed various tests for determining the optimum flux threshold , minimum size of a sf region , and best background subtraction method .",
    "we used the field  nga_m31_mos0 \" which has the longest exposure time ( 6,811  s ) in our selected _ galex _ data , to test and refine our procedures , which were then applied to all our selected fields .",
    "this field is good for testing various types of sf regions because it contains portions from innermost to outermost spiral arms and the large ob association ngc 206 .",
    "first of all , we compared various thresholds for the detection of source pixels .",
    "we used the background - subtracted image (  -intbgsub \" ) provided by the gr4 pipeline .",
    "we estimated the mean background value by the sigma clipping method .",
    "we examined the results using thresholds of two , three , and five sigma above the mean background value ( see fig .",
    "we detect fainter objects if we use the lower thresholds , however the sf regions in the spiral arms merge together and the contamination by the background ( including older , diffuse populations ) is larger .",
    "we can easily define the bright regions if we use higher thresholds , however we can not detect the faint ones .",
    "the fuv magnitude limits of our detected sf regions from each threshold are shown in fig .",
    "3 , they are @xmath321.5 ( low ) , @xmath321.0 ( mid ) , and @xmath320.4 ( high threshold ) mag in the ab magnitude system .",
    "we adopted a threshold of three sigma above the mean background value , which showed in our analysis less contamination by background and marginally detects the faint regions .",
    "this results in an average fuv flux threshold of @xmath30.0032  c  s@xmath8  pixel@xmath8 , or @xmath325.9  mag  arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "then , we considered the minimum acceptable size of the sf regions , in order to eliminate contamination by background objects , artificial sources , foreground stars , and isolated bright stars in m31 .",
    "we considered 3@xmath10fwhm of _ galex _",
    "( @xmath313  arcsec or @xmath38.5  pixels ) as minimum diameter of a sf region , therefore we adopted a requirement of a minimum of 50 contiguous pixels ( @xmath31,600  pc@xmath2 or @xmath340  pc ) for the smallest sf region .",
    "we contoured the contiguous pixels selected for measuring the defined regions and we estimated the center of each sf region by the mid - point of the maximum diameter of its contour .",
    "these adopted threshold and minimum size of the sf regions , were then applied to all the selected fields .",
    "however , the exposure time differences among fields induces variation of the detection limit .",
    "therefore , we compared the detection fraction in overlapping image regions , one by one against the  nga_m31_mos0 \" field .",
    "we first tried a fixed threshold ( @xmath30.0032  c  s@xmath8  pixel@xmath8 ) for source detection in the  nga_m31_mos0 \" image . in this case , in images with shorter exposure time sources are over - detected and include noise .",
    "a second method used the variable threshold of three sigma above the mean background value from each image .",
    "this produced similar contours in the overlapping regions .",
    "however , some sources in the shorter exposure time images were undetected because the background has larger sigma values .",
    "finally , we adopted the ratio between detected and undetected pixels of overlapping regions .",
    "this case produced slight over - detection in the shorter exposure time images .",
    "therefore , we used the last method , manually varying the thresholds in each field , such as to obtain similar detections in overlapping regions .",
    "the final selected fuv pixel maps are shown in fig .",
    "4 . as a last step , we compared the detected sf regions within overlapping image portions by visual inspection to select a final catalog of unique sources . at the end , we obtained a catalog of 894 sf regions cleaned of artifacts , isolated stars , and overlapping objects .",
    "we measured the flux within the contours of the sf regions as defined above , and subtracted the local background , estimated in a circular annulus surrounding the source .",
    "we initially used an inner / outer size of the annulus of 1.5/3 times the size of each sf region .",
    "however , for the largest sources , which are mostly found along the spiral arms , the annulus for background measurement scaled in this way becomes too large and includes unrelated stellar populations .",
    "therefore , we tested three different procedures to estimate the background .",
    "one was to measure the local background (  ap .",
    "sky \" in fig .",
    "5 ) , adjusting the radius of the background annulus according to the size of the source .",
    "we adopted a variable scaling of inner / outer radii for the background annulus , adjusted as 2/4 , 2/3 , 1.5/2.5 , 1.1/1.3 , and 1.05/1.2 times the source size ( r@xmath11 ) for the following ranges of source size respectively : r@xmath11",
    "@xmath12 10 , 10 @xmath5 r@xmath11 @xmath12 20 , 20 @xmath5 r@xmath11 @xmath12 50 , 50 @xmath5 r@xmath11 @xmath12 100 , and 100 @xmath5 r@xmath11 ( [ pixels ] ) .",
    "such ranges were found adequate to ensure a large enough area for the background measurement for the smallest sources , while preventing excessively large areas to be included in the calculations for large sources .",
    "the second background estimate was obtained from the gr4 pipeline background image (  -skybg \" ) , and the third measurement was performed by applying a median filter to the image . in the case of the gr4 pipeline background (  pipe .",
    "sky \" in fig .",
    "5 ) , a sky background image is produced by a 5@xmath105 median filter size which is good for the case of poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "the background measured using this image , underestimates the local contribution by the galaxy s background light , especially from surrounding stellar populations in the spiral arms . in the case of the median",
    "filtered background (  med .",
    "sky \" in fig .",
    "5 ) , a smaller filter size ( 3@xmath103 pixels ) than the standard pipeline was used to produce the background images .",
    "the choice of a smaller filter size was driven by the consideration of spiral arm regions which host most of the sf regions .",
    "the results from this background estimate are similar to those from the local background and reflect well the brightness of spiral arms .",
    "the results from the three methods are compared in fig .",
    "the background from the pipeline sky image is always underestimated because it measures the lowest sky level and not the local diffuse stellar population surrounding the source . in the right - side panels in fig . 5",
    ", we see that this estimate is not sensitive to the spiral arm enhancements , as the local - background estimates are .",
    "the local sky estimate is similar to the results from the median - filtered measurements but shows less scatter for sources with multiple observations in overlapping regions . in fig .",
    "6 , we compare the photometry results using the three different methods for background subtraction in color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "most sf regions have fuv @xmath9 nuv color between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in abmag .",
    "the measurements from the pipeline and median - filtered backgrounds induce brighter nuv than fuv , especially for sources fainter than 20  mag .",
    "we finally adopted the result from the local background .",
    "the resulting catalog of sf regions and their _ galex _ photometry is given in table 2 .",
    "in order to derive the physical parameters of the sf regions from the integrated photometry , we must take into account the interstellar extinction .",
    "we estimated the reddening of each uv sf region from the reddening of the massive stars included within its contour . for massive stars we used the reddening - free parameter q @xcite .",
    "we used the optical point - source measurements of m31 sources from p. massey ( priv .",
    "comm . , 2009 ) , which is a revised m31 catalog from the noao survey data described by @xcite .",
    "we selected sources with @xmath15 measurements having photometric errors lower than 0.1  mag in all bands ( 108,089 objects out of their 371,781 total sources catalog ) , which results in a magnitude limit of about 23rd  mag in @xmath16-band .",
    "this data is deep enough to select ob type stars which we used to estimate the interstellar reddening of our sf regions .",
    "we selected ob type stars by comparing colors and brightness of the galactic ob type main sequence stars from @xcite .",
    "we selected stars from o3 to b2v , because a b2v star has @xmath17 = @xmath18 which is @xmath16 = @xmath19 in m31 ( @xmath20 = 24.47 ) in absence of extinction .",
    "we do nt know the internal reddening of m31 , therefore we used the reddening - free parameter @xmath21 to select the ob stars .",
    "@xmath21 = @xmath22 - @xmath23@xmath24    the @xmath25 ratio is a constant ( 0.72 ) for milky way dust type @xcite and does not vary much for other dust types , within a reasonably small range of @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we selected the ob stars which have @xmath21 between @xmath27 ( o3v ) and @xmath28 ( b2v ) . in order to reduce contamination , we also adopted magnitude and color limits ; @xmath29 @xmath5 @xmath17 @xmath5 @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath5 @xmath32 @xmath5 0.46 , and @xmath33 @xmath5 @xmath34 @xmath5 @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "the location of the selected ob stars in color - magnitude diagrams are presented in fig .",
    "7 . with these restrictions",
    ", we finally selected 22,655 o - b2 stars from the data of @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of these stars , shown in fig .",
    "1 , represents well the spiral structure of m31 .",
    "the interstellar extinction of the selected ob stars was estimated from the reddening free parameter q@xmath36 , using the empirical relationship for giant and main - sequence stars by @xcite .",
    "@xmath37    the estimated @xmath26 has mean , median , and mode value of about 0.34 , 0.32 , and 0.29 , respectively , from our selected ob stars .",
    "the mean reddening value of ob stars is larger than @xcite s typical value @xmath26 = 0.13 which is estimated visually from the location of the `` blue plume '' in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this difference may be caused by our selection of blue stars for the reddening estimate .",
    "we also explore in this paper more reddened regions than the average entire stellar population .",
    "we estimated the extinction by interstellar dust for each sf region from the average reddening of the ob stars within the sf region contour .",
    "for the sf regions outside of @xcite survey , we assumed @xmath26 = 0.20 .",
    "the spatial distributions of estimated interstellar reddening of ob stars and sf regions are shown in fig",
    "the interstellar extinction decreases from the inner disk region outwards .",
    "in particular , inner - most and south - west areas where we could not detect sf regions , have high interstellar extinction .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .",
    "our detection method is based on the fuv flux , which could vanish in high interstellar extinction regions .",
    "for comparison with our fuv - defined sf regions , we also used a path linkage criterion ( plc : * ? ? ? * ) method ( explored by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) to detect ob associations using o - b2 stars .",
    "we applied the plc method varying the minimum number of stars ( n@xmath38 ) and maximum link distance ( d@xmath39 ) ( see fig .",
    "the best choice of n@xmath38 and d@xmath39 was found to be n@xmath38 = 5 stars and d@xmath39 = 10.4 arcsec ( @xmath340  pc ) .",
    "@xcite found 174 ob associations and estimated a total number of @xmath3420 associations in m31 from a similar method but different optical photometry . with this method",
    ", we found 650 ob associations in m31 from the o - b2 stars selected by us from @xcite photometry , which is @xmath3 2 mag deeper than what @xcite used .",
    "we compared these ob associations with the 894 sf regions selected from fuv imaging .",
    "they mostly overlap with the fuv - detected regions ( see fig .",
    "10 ) , however some of fuv - selected sf regions have a larger area than ob associations defined from stellar photometry , and some additional ob associations are found from stellar photometry in high interstellar extinction regions .",
    "the observation fields of @xcite cover a smaller area than our _ galex _ imaging , therefore we compared our results within 17  kpc de - projected distance ( about 1  deg@xmath2 ; dashed ellipse in fig .",
    "10 ) from the center of m31 .",
    "the total area of the sf regions derived from the fuv contours ( section 3 ) , and of the ob associations derived from stellar photometry ( above ) , are 4.1  % and 3.5  % of the area of the 17  kpc disk , respectively .",
    "the numbers of o - b2 stars are 9094/11350 and 8670/11774 inside / outside of the uv - defined sf regions and of ob associations .",
    "the average projected density of ob stars in the associations is 0.017 and 0.018  stars  arcsec@xmath4 from uv - selected sf regions and ob associations selected from stellar photometry , respectively .",
    "the projected density of stars inside sf regions is about a factor of 20 higher than in general field .",
    "the comparison between the two methods is interesting , because the fuv - selected contours are more affected by interstellar reddening than the optical stellar photometry , on the other hand optical bands are not as sensitive as the fuv is to the t@xmath40 of the hottest stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the similarity of the total number of ob stars detected inside young associations and in the field , by the two methods is remarkable .",
    "the slight difference in the estimated area of the associations may be due , at least partly , to the low ( @xmath415  arcsec ) spatial resolution of the _ galex _ imaging .",
    "we estimated the ages of the sf regions by comparing the measured ( fuv @xmath9 nuv ) colour with synthetic simple stellar population ( ssp ) models , reddened by the extinction amount estimated for each region .",
    "we explored effects of metallicity and dust type on the results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then we estimated the masses of the sf regions from the reddening - corrected uv luminosity and the derived ages .",
    "we used two sets of ssp models , one from @xcite ( bc03 ) and the other from padua ( pd : a. bressan , priv .",
    "comm . , 2007 ) .",
    "the ages derived from the two grids of models do not differ significantly ( see lower left panel of fig .",
    "ages estimated using the bc03 models tend to be slightly younger than those derived using the pd models , below 30  myrs , and do not differ at all for older populations ( fig .",
    "11 , lower left panel ) .",
    "the small age difference propagates to the derived masses , as shown in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "the differences between results from the two model grids is not significant .",
    "we used the pd models in our analysis .",
    "most sf regions have uv colour between @xmath13 and 1.0 ( see upper left panel of fig .",
    ". the estimated ages of most sf regions in our sample are younger than 400  myrs , reflecting our fuv - based selection .",
    "our detection limit , plotted with a line in fig .",
    "11 , indicates quantitatively how the flux - detection limit translates into mass detection limit , as a function of age , and shows that we can not detect low mass sf regions at older ages , as expected .",
    "however , we also notice a lack of massive sf regions at younger ages . this will be discussed later .",
    "we explored three metallicity values : subsolar ( z=0.008 ) , solar ( z=0.02 ) , and supersolar ( z=0.05 ) metallicity , although m31 is believed to have a typical metallicity about twice higher than the mw ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our census of young stellar populations based on wide - field fuv imaging has an unprecedented extent , while direct metallicity measurements from spectroscopy are confined to limited samples .",
    "therefore , we wanted to assess in general the dependence of our results on metallicity , which may vary in some environments .",
    "we also examined the effect of four types of interstellar dust : milky way ( @xmath42 = 3.1 ; mw , @xcite ) , average large magellanic cloud ( avglmc ) , 30 doradus ( lmc2 ) @xcite , and small magellanic cloud ( smc , * ? ? ? * ) dust extinction .",
    "the resulting ages and masses of the sf regions are plotted in figs 11 , 12 , and 13 .",
    "the differences in derived ages and masses for three metallicity values and different types of interstellar dust are presented in fig .",
    "we considered metallicity values of no less than z=0.008 because we expect the young sf regions not to be as metal poor as old globular clusters . in fig .",
    "12 ages and masses derived from models with solar metallicity , and assuming mw - type interstellar reddening ( r@xmath43 = 3.1 ) , are compared to results from subsolar ( z=0.008 ) and supersolar ( z=0.05 ) metallicities ( top four panels ) .",
    "the derived ages are older for subsolar metallicity , and younger for supersolar metallicity , with respect to solar metallicity results .",
    "the differences are most significant for ages younger than 100  myrs ( see also fig .",
    "9 of * ? ? ?",

    "the number distribution of sf regions with ages also differs , as shown in fig .",
    "12 . this will be taken into account in the following analysis , where we derive the global sf in m31 as a function of time .",
    "the difference in the derived masses is not conspicuous , considering the uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty of the ages derived by comparing the photometry to synthetic population models , reported in table 2 , is derived by propagating only the photometric errors , because we investigated and showed separately the effects of different metallicity values and dust types .",
    "the uncertainty on the derived masses reflects the uncertainty on the photometry and the age .",
    "reddening corrections , as derived in section 5 , are applied .",
    "the lower four panels of fig .",
    "12 show the effects of the correction for reddening",
    ". if the selective extinction by dust is steeper in the uv than the mw dust , as observed for example in the lmc ( average ) or the extreme starburst regions 30 dor ( labelled as  avglmc \" and  lmc2 \" , respectively , in fig . 12 ) , the dereddened uv luminosity will be higher but the dereddened fuv @xmath9 nuv color bluer , resulting in much younger ages and consequently lower masses .",
    "an lmc - type dust is however not likely in m31 .",
    "@xcite report uv extinction curves in m31 similar to the average mw extinction , from uv spectra of ob stars . moreover , if we apply uv extinction steeper than mw dust , most measured fuv @xmath9 nuv colors appear to be over - corrected , when compared to ssp model predictions . out of 847 sf regions",
    "whose ( fuv @xmath9 nuv)@xmath44 is within the model color range when dereddened with mw dust type , only 569/227/26 sf regions have ( fuv @xmath9 nuv)@xmath44 colors within the model range if the progressively steeper dust types avglmc / lmc2/smc are applied . therefore , uv - steep dust extinction seems to be not realistic in most cases .",
    "the fuv - selected sf regions follow the disk structure of m31 and their spatial distribution traces the recent star formation in m31 ( fig .",
    "13 ) . as can be seen in fig",
    ". 13 , most sf regions have de - projected distances between 40 and 75  arcmin ( 9 and 17  kpc ) from the center of m31 , with two peaks in this region .",
    "this region is well - known as the ring of fire or the star - formation ring ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this star formation ring between 40 and 75 arcmin from the galaxy center ,",
    "the number of young ( @xmath12 10  myrs ) sf regions is similar to that of older ( @xmath45 10  myrs ) ones .",
    "one thing of interest is that the number of younger sf regions ( 82 ) is larger than the number of older sf regions ( 40 ) outside of this ring ( @xmath46 @xmath45 75  arcmin ) . inside of the star formation ring ,",
    "the number of younger sf regions ( 14 ) , however , is less than that of older ones ( 89 ) .",
    "this suggests that the m31 disk formed stars continuously during the last few hundreds myrs at least and , furthermore , the outer disk shows more recent star formation .",
    "the size of some younger sf regions is larger than that of older sf regions , however most of them are less massive ( as derived from the uv flux ) than older regions .",
    "young , large sf regions may be broken into several sf regions with time , while some of the dense , small sf regions may survive longer than the others .",
    "we noticed a lack of massive sf regions younger than 50  myrs in fig .",
    "we would expect to find some massive young sf regions if star formation was constant .",
    "we estimated the total sfr in m31 using the ages and masses of the sf regions derived in section 6 .",
    "we added the estimated initial masses of the sf regions separated in four time bins , to investigate the sfr time evolution .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "14 , and reported in table 3 , for three metallicity values .",
    "although in each age interval the derived sfr depends on the assumed metallicity , in all cases fig.14 shows an apparent decrease of sfr in the recent epoch ( @xmath12 10  myrs ) with respect to the average value in the interval 10 - 100  myrs ago , the difference being smallest ( and probably not significant ) for supersolar metallicity , which is currently believed to be the most probable value for m31 .",
    "the dashed line across the whole time interval is the average from the sf regions of all ages .",
    "when interpreting this diagram , we must first of all recall that the masses are estimated from the uv flux above a certain threshold , and the corresponding limit for mass detection increases at older ages ( fig .",
    "11 , continuous line ) .",
    "therefore , the total stellar mass formed over 100  myrs ago may be relatively underestimated compared to that of younger populations , due to our fuv selection .",
    "this bias makes the apparent decrease in sfr at young ages more robust .",
    "most of the time - binned and mean sfrs are lower than one solar mass per year .",
    "these values can be compared to the m31 s sfrs from ir and h@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite estimated a sfr of 0.4  @xmath47  yr@xmath8 from 8  @xmath48 m non - stellar emission , higher than our uv - derived sfr in the @xmath124  myrs bin , if we assume solar metallicity , but comparable to our value for supersolar metallicity .",
    "this shows that each indicator alone , uv or ir , may miss about half of the most recently formed stellar mass .",
    "@xcite estimated 0.05  @xmath47  yr@xmath8 from h@xmath6 luminosities , lower ( within a factor of two ) than our estimate for the @xmath1210  myrs bin ( solar metallicity ) .",
    "we used 7 _ galex _ fields covering the entire disk of m31 ( out to @xmath3 26  kpc radius ) to study its young stellar population .",
    "we detected 894 sf regions from the fuv imaging , and measured their integrated fuv and nuv fluxes .",
    "we estimated the interstellar extinction in each sf region from the ob stars within its contour , using the ground - based stellar photometry of @xcite .",
    "we estimated ages and masses of our sf regions in m31 , detected from fuv imaging , by comparing the fuv and nuv measurements to population synthesis models .",
    "most are younger than 400  myrs ( uv is not sensitive to older ages ) .",
    "interestingly , there are no massive sf regions at young ages ( age @xmath12 50  myrs in fig .",
    "11 ) , suggesting an apparent decrease of the sfr , as detected from the fuv imaging .    there may be a potential bias , due to our definition of the sf contours from the fuv image , concerning the size distribution and average surface brightness .",
    "younger sf complexes tend to be more compact , and older stellar associations are less dense , in general @xcite .",
    "therefore , the same flux detection algorithm may break a young sf area into several peaks , but these contiguous regions may appear connected if they spread out at older ages .",
    "this bias , however , does not appear significant from visual inspection of the complex sf areas along spiral arms , and younger associations tend to have larger size in our selection . in any case , the bias would only affect the apparent distribution [ with age ] of sizes and masses of the individual sf regions , and not affect the results when we add all individual masses in a wide age interval , in order to derive the total sfr in m31 .",
    "because we have estimated ages and masses of the individual sf complexes , and the uv flux is sensitive to a much broader age range than e.g. h@xmath6 or ir , we were also able to derive the recent sfr in m31 as a function of time .",
    "we estimated the sfr in four time intervals adding the masses of the sf regions of corresponding ages .",
    "the resulting masses are restricted by our detection limit which is shown in fig .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "14 shows a recent apparent decrease of the sfr , as derived from the uv flux .",
    "however , we know that the youngest and compact sf regions are often still embedded in dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these escape detection from uv imaging , but are instead revealed by ir emission from heated dust .",
    "therefore , for a complete account of star formation in the very young age bins ( @xmath12 10  myrs ) , we added the ir - measured star formation from @xcite .",
    "the total sfr at young ages ( uv + ir estimates ) is shown as thick lines at the top of vertical arrows in fig .",
    "this more realistic and complete estimate of the star formation in the recent few million years significantly reduces the apparent recent decrease in sfr , as derived from uv flux only .",
    "we also show the average stellar mass formed in a @xmath5 10  myrs bin , from our uv measurements , for comparison to h@xmath6 estimates . because h@xmath6 is an indirect measurement of the ionizing photons from the short - lived o - type stars , the sfr derived from this method",
    "must be compared to our age bin of @xmath5 10  myrs .",
    "the uv and h@xmath6 sfr estimates agree within a factor of two , for solar metallicity , as shown in fig . 14 .",
    "if we assume supersolar metallicity for all sources ( z=0.05 ) , then the h@xmath6 underestimates the sfr by a factor of ten with respect to the sfr derived from the uv sources in the recent 10  myrs .",
    "we note that the results shown in fig .",
    "14 are derived by dereddening the uv fluxes with mw - type dust extinction .",
    "if uv - steeper reddening applies to the intrinsic dust extinction in some sf regions , their derived ages would be younger ( see fig .",
    "12 ) , resulting in a sfr lower for older ages and higher for younger ages than the values shown in fig.14 , and increasing the discreapancy with the h@xmath6 estimate .",
    "even when the ir- and uv - derived sfrs are added at the youngest epochs , there seem to be a recent decrease of sfr , or a peak of sfr between @xmath3 10 - 100  myrs ( although the uv estimate of sf at older ages is a lower limit , as previously explained ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that m31 had a starburst during this interval .",
    "a possible scenario is that galaxy interaction may have induced violent star formation around this time interval .",
    "@xcite considered a collisional event with m32 around 20  myrs ago to explain the ring structure by dynamical models .",
    "@xcite also postulated a head - on collision event with m32 and estimated it happened around 210  myrs ago .",
    "we now have a possible evidence of a recent starburst in m31 , which may have constructed the ring structure .",
    "this work presented the first estimate of the recent sfr based on measurements of individual sf regions across the entire galaxy , from uv imaging .",
    "@xcite provide a comparison of sf , based on h@xmath6 measurements , among local group galaxies , and several other authors give estimates of sf in nearby galaxies .",
    "however , their results are mostly derived under the assumption of continuous star formation , translating global fluxes into sf .",
    "our study provides a time - resolved sfr over the past few hundred million years .",
    "we will perform a similar analysis on other local group galaxies , for a consistent comparison of results from our method within a range of physical environments .",
    "such comparison should also clarify the relative calibration of uv , ir , and h@xmath6 as sf indicators as a function of galaxy physical conditions .    in future works , we will also compare the parameters describing the properties of sf regions from the integrated measurements with resolved studies of their stellar populations ( from ground - based and bianchi s hst programs data ) .",
    "we will estimate ages and masses from deeper _ galex _ images to test the limit of our current detection threshold .",
