    "however , since the integrals of motion   and   do not hold along the geodesics , the velocities will not necessarily match .",
    "newton found that if the angular velocity of a particle following a keplerian orbit is multiplied by a constant factor @xmath421 , it is then possible to describe the dynamics by superposing a central force depending on an inverse cubic power of the radius .",
    "the additional perturbing terms depend only on the angular momentum of the original orbit and the value of @xmath421 .",
    "consider a keplerian orbit defined as @xmath469 here @xmath470 denotes the true anomaly .",
    "the radial motion of hyperbolic spirals of type ii eq .",
    " resembles a keplerian hyperbola .",
    "the difference between both orbits comes from the angular motion , because they revolve with different angular velocities . indeed , recovering eq .",
    ", identifying @xmath471 and @xmath472 , and calling the spiral anomaly @xmath473 , it is @xmath474 when equated to eq .",
    ", it follows a relation between the spiral ( @xmath475 ) and the true ( @xmath476 ) anomalies : @xmath477 the factor @xmath421 reads @xmath478 replacing @xmath476 by @xmath479 in eq .   and introducing the result in the equations of motion in polar coordinates gives rise to the radial acceleration that renders a hyperbolic generalized logarithmic spiral of type ii , namely @xmath480 this is in fact the same result predicted by newton s theorem of revolving orbits .    the radial acceleration @xmath481 yields a hyperbolic generalized logarithmic spiral of type ii .",
    "this is a central force which preserves the angular momentum , but not the integral of motion in eq .  .",
    "thus , a particle accelerated by @xmath481 describes the same trajectory as a particle accelerated by the perturbation in eq .  , but with different velocities . as a consequence ,",
    "the times between two given points are also different .",
    "the acceleration derives from the specific potential @xmath482 where @xmath483 denotes the keplerian potential , and @xmath484 is the perturbing potential : @xmath485      the inverse of a generic conic section @xmath486 , using one of its foci as the center of inversion , defines a limaon . in particular , the inverse of a parabola results in a cardioid .",
    "let us recover the equation of the trajectory of a generalized parabolic cardioid ( a true cardioid ) from eq .  , @xmath487.\\ ] ] taking the cusp",
    "as the inversion center defines the inverse curve : @xmath488^{-1}.\\ ] ] identifying the terms in this equation with the elements of a parabola it follows that the inverse of a generalized parabolic cardioid with apoapsis @xmath150 is a keplerian parabola with periapsis @xmath489 .",
    "the axis of symmetry remains invariant under inversion ; the lines of apses coincide .",
    "the subfamily of elliptic generalized logarithmic spirals is a generalized form of cotes s spirals , more specifically of poinsot s spirals : @xmath490 cotes s spirals are known to be the solution to the motion immerse in a potential @xmath491 @xcite .    the radial motion of interior type ii hyperbolic and type i elliptic sinusoidal spirals has the same form , and is also equal to that of type ii hyperbolic generalized cardioids , except for the sorting of the terms .",
    "it is worth noticing that the dynamics along hyperbolic sinusoidal spirals with @xmath377 are qualitatively similar to the motion under a central force decreasing with @xmath2 . indeed , the orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinusoidal_trans ] behave as the limit case @xmath84 discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  4 ) .",
    "on the other hand , parabolic sinusoidal spirals ( off - center circles ) are also the solution to the motion under a central force proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical symmetries in kepler s problem hold under a special nonconservative perturbation : a disturbance that modifies the tangential and normal components of the gravitational acceleration in the intrinsic frame renders two integrals of motion , which are generalized forms of the equations of the energy and angular momentum .",
    "the existence of a similarity transformation that reduces the original problem to a system perturbed by a tangential uniparametric forcing simplifies the dynamics significantly , for the integrability of the system is evaluated in terms of one single parameter .",
    "the algebraic properties of the equations of motion dictate what values of the free parameter make the problem integrable in closed form .",
    "the extended integrals of motion include the keplerian ones as particular cases .",
    "the new conservation laws can be seen as generalizations of the original integrals .",
    "the new families of solutions are defined by fundamental curves in the zero - energy case , and there are geometric transformations that relate different orbits",
    ". the orbits can be unified by introducing the weierstrass elliptic functions .",
    "this approach simplifies the modeling of the system .",
    "the solutions derived in this paper are closely related to different physical problems .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of the acceleration decreases with @xmath492 makes it comparable with the perturbation due to the solar radiation pressure .",
    "moreover , the inverse similarity transformation converts keplerian orbits into the conic sections obtained when the solar radiation pressure is directed along the radial direction .",
    "the structure of the solutions , governed by the roots of a polynomial , is similar in nature to the schwarzschild geodesics .",
    "this is because under the considered perturbation and in schwarzschild metric the evolution of the radial distance takes the same form .",
    "the perturbation can also be seen as a control law for a continuous - thrust propulsion system .",
    "some of the solutions are comparable with the orbits deriving from potentials depending on different powers of the radial distance .",
    "although the trajectory may take the same form , the velocity will be different , in general .",
