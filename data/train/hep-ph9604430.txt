    "one important framework for non  perturbative studies of qcd is provided by the infinite tower of its dyson  schwinger equations .",

    "schwinger equation in landau gauge originally proposed by mandelstam @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equation will be referred to as mandelstam s equation in the following .",
    "two distinct approaches to its numerical solution are reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "it was already pointed out by mandelstam that for selfconsistent solutions to exist , certain conditions on the behavior of the gluon propagator in the infrared have to be met @xcite .",
    "an existence proof , a discussion of the singularity structure and an asymptotic expansion in the infrared for the solution to mandelstam s original equation can be found in @xcite . taking care of various violations of gauge invariance in the approximation ,",
    "one arrives at a slightly different equation @xcite .",
    "we present an approach to the numerical solution of both equations , which combines methods of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general arguments that follow apply to both versions of the equation .    to remove the ultraviolet divergences in the equation for the gluon self  energy , wave  function renormalization",
    "is required , thus introducing an arbitrary scale @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrate , how the renormalized equation can be cast in a renormalization group invariant form .",
    "we solve this equation numerically and determine the running coupling from the solution via the renormalization condition .",
    "we show that the product of the coupling and gluon propagator , @xmath7 , does not acquire multiplicative renormalisation in the mandelstam approximation .",
    "this allows to identify a physical scale , the string tension , from the infrared singular result for this quantity .",
    "consequently , our non  perturbative and renormalisation group invariant results yield a relation between the string tension and the only parameter in our calculation , the qcd scale @xmath8 .",
    "this relation is in reasonable agreement with the respective phenomenological values .",
    "we obtain a non  perturbative @xmath0 function and recover the scaling behavior of perturbative qcd at the ultraviolet fixed point modulo small corrections due to the presence of ghosts in landau gauge . for positive values of the coupling no further fixed point exists .",

    "the situation changes dramatically when ghosts are included @xcite .",
    "then the running coupling approaches an infrared stable fixed point .",

    "a generalization to the solution of the coupled gluon ",
    "ghost equations will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the central idea of how to treat anticipated infrared singularities in non  linear integral equations is much more transparent and easier developed from the simplified equations discussed here .",
    "the present results allow furthermore for a detailed comparison of the two schemes .",

    "the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation for the inverse gluon propagator in the covariant gauge would be transverse without further adjustments .",
    "the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator does not acquire dressing and cancels with the one of the bare propagator .",

    "taylor identities and also due to a regularization that does not preserve the residual local invariance , i.e. , the invariance under transformations generated by harmonic gauge functions ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "this term violates the masslessness condition ( [ massless ] ) and has therefore been dismissed .",
    "as observed by brown and pennington @xcite , in general , quadratic ultraviolet divergences can occur only in the part of the inverse gluon propagator proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , that part can not be unambiguously determined , it depends on the routing of the momenta .",
    "this is due to the various violations of gauge invariance mentioned above .",

    "for the sake of a detailed understanding of what exactly can be attributed to ghosts , it is nevertheless necessary to thoroughly study the implications of the mandelstam approximation , most remarkably on the running coupling , in order to compare to conclusions of the present and earlier work on the dyson  schwinger equations of landau gauge qcd .",
    "besides this , the major numerical concepts used in the present paper , entirely devoted to the mandelstam approximation , will apply to the coupled system of ghosts and gluons in landau gauge with little changes .",
    "one might think that the particular problem problem with ghosts can be avoided using gauges such as the axial gauge , in which there are no ghosts in the first place . as for studies of the gluon dyson ",
    "schwinger equation in axial gauge @xcite it is important to note that these rely on an _ ad hoc _ assumption on the tensor structure of the gluon propagator .",
    "the occurrence of a second independently possible term , which happens to vanish in perturbation theory , has been disregarded so far @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the complete tensor structure of the gluon propagator in axial gauge is taken into account properly , one arrives at a coupled system of equations which is of similar complexity as the ghost ",
    "gluon system in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "progress is desirable in axial gauge as well , of course .",
    "a necessary prerequisite for this , however , is a proper treatment of the spurious infrared divergences which are well known to be present in axial gauge due to zero modes .",
    "this can be achieved by either introducing redundant degrees of freedom , i.e.  ghosts , also in this gauge ( by which it obviously looses its particular advantage ) or by using a modified axial gauge @xcite , which is specially designed to account for those zero modes .",
    "eventually , progress in more than one gauge will be the only reliable way to asses the influence of spurious gauge dependencies .",

    "@xmath187 is , @xmath188 from the infrared behavior of the renormalization group invariant product @xmath189 we may deduce a linear rising potential between static color sources for large distances .",
    "this allows us to relate the coefficient of the @xmath190 term in the interaction to the string tension @xmath2 , @xmath191 with the identification @xmath192 ( from the ultraviolet ) and the infrared behavior of the solution , @xmath193 the non  perturbative result for the gluon propagator relates the string tension to the scale @xmath194 , yielding @xmath195 in the mandelstam approximation .",
    "the string tension can be fixed from quarkonia potentials and regge phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the result is a value of about @xmath196 .",
    "this has also been confirmed in lattice calculations @xcite . here",
    ", it corresponds to a scale @xmath194 of 600 mev .",
    "in this paper we have derived the infrared behavior of the strong coupling constant from mandelstam s approximation @xcite to the gluon dyson  schwinger equation .",
    "this approximation results in a gluon propagator diverging like @xmath197 for @xmath198 .",
    "this highly infrared singular behavior of the gluon propagator generates a linearly rising potential between static color sources .",
    "the corresponding string tension @xmath2 can be used to fix the scale in the resulting gluon self  energy . in particular , the non  perturbative solution allows to relate the string tension to the qcd scale @xmath194 .",

    "note that dimensional transmutation occurs here : the coefficient @xmath199 of the infrared singular term is a dimensionful physical quantity , whereas all input is dimensionless except for the renormalization scale @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown that the product of the coupling and the gluon propagator , @xmath189 , does not acquire multiplicative renormalization in mandelstam approximation ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "the leading logarithmic decrease of the gluon renormalization function allows to identify the scaling coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath200 at the fix point .",
    "the scaling coefficients we obtain are in reasonable agreement with the perturbative results .",
    "in addition , we have shown that there is no further fix point for positive values of the coupling in the mandelstam approximation .",
    "the resulting strong coupling constant increases without bound in the infrared .    we have demonstrated how to solve an integral equation with infrared singlular solution .",
    "this combines numerical and analytic methods based on asymptotic expansions .",

    "on startup all relevant variables are initialized .",
    "these include the maximum number of iterations ( _ nitmax _ ) , the number of meshpoints ( _ meshpts _ ) used to represent @xmath72 on a grid , and the orders in the asymptotic expansion ( _ nmax , mmax _ ) .",
    "furthermore the infrared matching point @xmath131 and the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath133 are set to some appropriate values ( _ xmin , xmax _ respectively ) .",
    "the variable _ eps _ is introduced to assess the accuracy of the result .",
    "after this , the initial gluon function and the corresponding asymptotic series are generated . in the following , in each iteration a new temporary gluon function is calculated from equation . in order to fullfill the constraint this temporary gluon function together with the asymptotic series , i.e. , the constant @xmath130 , are rescaled appropriately before the result of this two  step process is used in the next iteration .",
    "convergence is monitored by pointwise comparing the relative deviation between the current result for the gluon function and the result of the previous iteration .",
    "once the maximum deviation is below the desired accuracy _",
    "eps _ , the iteration process is halted .",
    "finally , from @xmath72 the running coupling @xmath201 is calculated along with the @xmath0-function defined by @xmath202 .",

    "extensive tests were performed to establish resonable ranges to be used for the infrared matching point @xmath131 als well as the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath133 .",
    "independence of the results on these matching points was obtained within these ranges to sufficiently high accuracy . to achieve this ,",
    "tests have been performed to find the necessary order in the asymptotic infrared expansion .",
    "the inclusion of even higher orders in this expansion was verified to have no considerable effect on the results .",
    "similar tests were done to verify the independence of the ( sufficiently large ) number of momentum meshpoints as well as the independence of the initial values chosen for the gluon renormalization function .",
    "we solved both , mandelstam s original equation ( [ eq : mandelstam ] ) as well as the improved equation ( [ eq : brown ] ) obtained by brown and pennington in the same truncation scheme , with the method presented here .",
