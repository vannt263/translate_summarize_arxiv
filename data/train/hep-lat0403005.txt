    "a major goal of nuclear physics is to be able to rigorously compute the properties and interactions of nuclei directly from qcd .",
    "while qcd is formulated in terms of quarks and gluons , the relevant degrees of freedom of strongly interacting systems probed at low - momentum are the lowest - lying hadrons .",
    "while the properties of these hadrons are well known experimentally , and some of their interactions are also well studied ( such as the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross - section ) , in general , direct measurement of the interactions that contribute to nuclear processes is not possible .",
    "for instance , there are multi - nucleon interactions induced at the chiral symmetry breaking scale , that will not be directly measured , but which contribute to the interactions of nuclei .",
    "the only way of rigorously computing strong interaction observables and electroweak observables involving hadrons , is with lattice qcd . in lattice",
    "qcd space - time is discretized and green functions are evaluated in euclidean space . at this point in time the variety of processes that can be addressed with lattice qcd is quite limited .",
    "present day computational power restricts the sizes of lattices , the lattice spacings , and the quark masses that can be used in simulations , making the extraction of physical observables non - trivial .",
    "even if infinite computing power were to become available tomorrow most of the formal framework with which to calculate most nuclear properties and observables does not yet exist .",
    "notable exceptions are the nn and nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) scattering lengths and range parameters  @xcite . at the heart of the issue",
    "is the maiani - testa theorem  @xcite which precludes determination of scattering amplitudes from euclidean - space green functions at infinite volume away from kinematic thresholds . by generalizing a result from non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite to quantum field theory , lscher  @xcite showed how to extract the @xmath1 scattering amplitude from the energy - levels of two particles in a finite - volume lattice simulation .",
    "this technique has been used to determine the low - energy @xmath2 phase shifts directly from qcd , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . however , only one lattice qcd calculation of the nn scattering lengths  @xcite exists , and it is quenched with relatively large quark masses ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we establish a framework with which to extract the electroweak matrix elements in the two - nucleon sector .",
    "this is only a small step toward a framework with which to determine electroweak matrix elements in arbitrary multi - nucleon systems , however , the two - nucleon sector is pleasantly challenging all by itself . naively this appears to require the computation of hadronic five - point correlators , a daunting task that is beyond the reach of current computers .",
    "however , calculation of the energy - levels of two nucleons in a finite volume in the presence of appropriate background electroweak fields allows for these matrix elements to be extracted with little more computing resources than are needed to calculate the scattering parameters .",
    "we start by studying the energy - levels of two nucleons immersed in a background magnetic field . clearly",
    "a calculation of the deuteron electromagnetic properties will not be heralded as a major accomplishment ( though it would be an impressive test of lattice qcd ) as they are well - known from precise experiments , e.g. ref .",
    ". however , they do provide an illustration of how the long - distance and short - distance contributions can be isolated with lattice qcd .",
    "this technique is then generalized to weak background fields in order to allow for calculation of the axial matrix element that dominates @xmath3 break - up  @xcite , the process used by sno  @xcite to determine the flavor composition of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "the present - day uncertainty in this matrix element will provide a significant uncertainty in the determination of neutrino mass differences and mixing matrix derived from future experiments .",
    "determinations of the electroweak matrix elements will be independent of the hadronic theory used to compute the infrared ( ir ) properties of qcd as long as it is a complete theory consistent with all the symmetries of qcd . in this work we use effective field theory ( eft ) , and in particular , the pionless eft , @xmath4 to study the very low - momentum ( @xmath5 ) interaction of nucleons and electroweak gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 has been developed over the last few years to describe systems with unnaturally large scattering lengths , as are found in the multi - nucleon sector of qcd .",
    "such large scattering lengths result from a fine - tuning that nature has presented to us , more than likely for anthropic reasons , and as a result , the analysis in this work will not apply for arbitrary values of the light - quark masses .",
    "in the traditional approach to calculating electroweak observables in nuclear physics , one assumes that all processes are dominated by one - nucleon interactions with the electroweak probe , and that multi - nucleon contributions are small .",
    "these multi - nucleon interactions result from currents coupling to the exchange of single mesons , @xmath6 s , @xmath7 s and so forth , the same mesons that are used to construct nucleon - nucleon potentials  , do not rely on single meson exchange to describe the short - distance component of the nn potential , instead use some `` best - fit '' functional forms that minimize the @xmath8 of the fit to nn data . ] and are called `` meson - exchange currents '' ( mec s )   limit of qcd , is not true in general . ] . in the context of eft",
    ", these matrix elements receive contributions from one - nucleon interactions with the electroweak current , from interactions with the mesons that have masses below the cut - off of the theory ( in the pionless theory there are no mesonic contributions , while in the pionful theory there are contributions from pions ) and from local , two- ( or more ) nucleon  electroweak current interactions .",
    "these multi - nucleon interactions result from the physics at momentum scales above the cut - off of the eft that has been integrated out .",
    "a significant advantage of the eft is that no attempt is made to force these interactions to look like they result from the exchange of mesons  they are what they are .",
    "however , before the eft can become predictive , the coefficients of the various operators that occur in it must be determined either from experiment or from lattice qcd .    as the scattering lengths in both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are unnaturally large ( both channels are near their ir fixed - points  @xcite ) , @xmath4 can even be used to describe electroweak processes involving the deuteron .",
    "@xmath4 can be recast into a somewhat simpler theory with which to perform computations up to a given order in the momentum expansion by introducing dynamical   fields  @xcite .",
    "as s - matrix elements calculated in the usual formulation of @xmath4 and with the   formalism are the same at any given order in the expansion and the two frameworks differ only in the ultra - violet ( uv ) , both forms will give identical results for observables in a finite - volume .",

    "for the weak interactions , and in particular for an axial - vector interaction , the left- and right - handed quarks need to be immersed in different background fields .",
    "one way to implement this is to use domain - wall ( kaplan  @xcite ) fermions in the simulation and have the background field vary only in the fifth dimension .",
