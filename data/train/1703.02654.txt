    "orient the gray rectangles in the odd rows as whirlpools or anti - whirpools in such way that every gray square ( possibly except the last gray square in every row or every column ) in a even row , together with the four gray squares sharing a vertex with it , induce a digraph isomorphic to @xmath53 ( figure [ 4 * 4-c=4 ] ) .",
    "of course , to achieve this end , we also need to orient four additional arcs dividing either two white squares of @xmath7 , or a white square and the exterior face of @xmath7 . now , every unoriented edge of @xmath7 divides two white squares , or a white square from the exterior face in an even row or column of gray squares .",
    "orient every edge dividing two white squares in the same direction as the closest arc in a gray square in the same row or column .",
    "there are unoriented edges parallel to the arcs oriented in the previous step ; orient those edges in the same direction as the arcs they are parallel to .",
    "the remaining unoriented edges form paths on the exterior face of @xmath7 joining pairs of gray rectangles .",
    "orient those paths as directed paths in such way that , if any , the corner vertices of @xmath7 in a white square have in - degree and out - degree equal to one .",
    "figure [ n*m - c = abfig ] shows an example of this orientation .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath539 .",
    "orient @xmath540 as a whirlpool .",
    "now , re - orient the corresponding arcs in the fiber @xmath541 to obtain a directed path in the same direction ( left or right ) as the arc between @xmath542 and @xmath543 . also , orient the fiber @xmath544 as a directed path in the same direction as the arc between @xmath542 and @xmath543 .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath544 is oriented right .",
    "finally orient down every edge in @xmath545 except for @xmath546 , which is oriented up . if @xmath0 is the resulting oriented graph , then it is easy to verify that @xmath547 is a convex set of @xmath0 , and @xmath548 .    if @xmath522 , then orient @xmath549 as a whirlpool and @xmath550 as a whirlpool or as an anti - whirlpool in such way that the fibers @xmath551 and @xmath552 are isomorphic . orient the remaining edges arbitrarily ,",
    "as long as there is one arc going up and one arc going down , to obtain @xmath0 . we will show that @xmath292 is a convex set of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath553 be a @xmath554-path in @xmath0 such that every intermediate vertex of @xmath553 belongs to @xmath293 .",
    "then @xmath553 can be codified as @xmath555 .",
    "let @xmath556 be the sequence such that @xmath557    from the way we oriented @xmath302 and @xmath303 we conclude that @xmath558 defines a @xmath554-path in @xmath0 , strictly shorter than @xmath553 and such that @xmath559 .",
    "hence , @xmath292 is a convex set of @xmath0 .    recalling that @xmath560 , and using the fact that every convex set with more than @xmath561 vertices has at least two vertices in @xmath292 and at least two vertices in @xmath293 , we conclude that @xmath548 .",
    "consider a coloring of the squares of @xmath7 similar to the coloring used in the proof of lemma [ n*m - c = ab ] , with the following differences . in the lower left corner of the aforementioned orientation of @xmath7",
    "we have a rectangle , @xmath569 , of @xmath570 gray squares .",
    "consider the subgraph @xmath302 of @xmath7 obtained by deleting the first @xmath571 columns and the first @xmath572 rows of vertices of @xmath7 .",
    "color @xmath302 as in the proof of lemma [ n*m - c=4 ] .",
    "finally , complete the checkerboard - like pattern with gray rectangles of size @xmath573 squares in the first row , and with gray rectangles of size @xmath574 squares in the first column .",
    "we want our largest convex set to be a segment of @xmath569 , the gray rectangle in the lower left corner .",
    "color white the squares in the first @xmath96 columns from the top row of @xmath569 .",
    "also color white the squares in the first @xmath580 rows of the rightmost column of @xmath569 to obtain the gray region @xmath581 .",
    "now , orient @xmath7 as in lemma [ n*m - c = ab ] , orienting @xmath581 as a whirlpool .",
    "orient all the remaining edges to the right and down to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "an example of this orientation is depicted in figure [ n*m - c = ab - k - lfig ] .",
    "now , observe that the top right corner of @xmath581 coincides with the top right corner of @xmath569 .",
    "hence , this orientation has the same properties as the orientation of lemma [ n*m - c = ab ]",
    ". we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath582 .",
    "otherwise , assuming that @xmath583 , we have that @xmath584 for some pair of integerers @xmath585 such that @xmath586 , @xmath587 .",
    "hence , @xmath588 . from here",
    ", it is easy to observe that the only proper convex sets of @xmath0 are the vertices in each of the gray regions of @xmath0 . since the largest one is @xmath581 , which has @xmath589 vertices , we conclude @xmath590 .",
    "first , consider the case @xmath594 and @xmath514 .",
    "if @xmath595 , then the result follows from lemma [ n*m - c = ab - k - l ] .",
    "the orientations for @xmath596 are shown in figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] .",
    "it can be easily verified that the set of white vertices is a largest convex set for this orientation .",
    "now suppose that @xmath597 .",
    "the case @xmath598 follows from lemma [ n*m - c = ab - k - l ] .",
    "the orientation for @xmath599 is depicted in figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] .",
    "again , it is not hard to verify that the sets of white vertices are largest convex sets for each of the orientations .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath600 .",
    "if @xmath601 , then the result follows from lemma [ n*m - c = ab - k - l ] . the orientations for @xmath602 are depicted in figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] . as in the previous cases , the sets of white vertices are largest convex sets for the corresponding orientation .",
    "observe the orientations of the @xmath609 and @xmath610 grids in figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] for @xmath599 .",
    "clearly , the orientation of the latter can be obtained from the orientation of the former by adding an additional row of squares at the bottom of the grid , and orienting this new row as a whirlpool .",
    "naturally , three arcs of the former orientation should change its direction , in this case , these are the arcs @xmath611 and @xmath612 of the former oriented graph .",
    "we have a similar situation with the orientation of the @xmath613 and @xmath610 grids for @xmath599 and @xmath614 , respectively .",
    "again , the latter can be obtained from the former by adding one row and one column of squares , orienting the new row as an anti - whirlpool and the new column following certain pattern .",
    "the idea of this proof is to observe that the three orientations of the @xmath610 grids , shown in figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] , can be naturally extended to obtain the desired orientations .",
    "first , observe that , independently of the value of @xmath77 , we can always add a new row of squares at the bottom of the grid .",
    "notice that we are extending the largest convex set of the grid , but the complement of such set remains unchanged .",
    "hence , if we consider the aforementioned orientations of the @xmath610 grid , we can conclude that @xmath616 for every integer @xmath608 .    to add a new column of squares we have two different behaviors .",
    "first , consider the orientations for @xmath599 and @xmath598 . in this case , to add a new column , we need to change the direction of one arc , as in the @xmath609 and @xmath610 grids for the @xmath599 argument .",
    "but , to add further columns we will not need to change the direction of any arc , just add a column of squares oriented as a whirlpool . following this procedure we will obtain an orientation of the grid @xmath187 for every pair of integers @xmath617 , for @xmath599 and @xmath598 , respectively . in the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath614 , adding a new column will not preserve the complement of our largest convex set , the complement will grow larger .",
    "if we add a new column , following the pattern as in the example in figure [ n*m - c = nm - kfig ] , we will obtain an orientation of the grid @xmath187 for every pair of integers @xmath89 , for @xmath618 .",
    "we can generalize the orientations used for @xmath599 and @xmath598 , respectively , to obtain orientations of the grid @xmath187 for @xmath619 and @xmath620 .",
    "the idea is to extend the pattern horizontally , we will explain how it is done for the case @xmath621 , the remaining case is analogous .",
    "we want to preserve the @xmath622 directed path defined by the sequence @xmath623 , and the whirlpool ( or anti - whirlpool ) of @xmath624 squares in the upper right corner of the grid .",
    "the square of the upper left corner of the grid is oriented as a whirlpool and the rest of the grid is oriented as a whirlpool or anti - whirlpool , except for some alternating squares adjacent to the aforementioned directed path .",
    "the remaining unoriented edges are oriented as @xmath625 and , if it is still unoriented , @xmath626 . following a similar idea , orientations for every grid @xmath187 for any pair of integers @xmath627 and",
    "any @xmath628 can be obtained .",
    "we depict the orientations for @xmath629 for @xmath630 in figure [ n*m - c = nm - kfig ] .",
    "since all these orientations follow a similar pattern , it can be easily proved that each one has convexity number @xmath631 , as desired .",
    "now , consider the case @xmath514 . if @xmath634 ( mod 4 ) , then lemma [ n*m - c = nb ] gives the desired orientation .",
    "else , we give basic orientations that can be enlarged adding columns of whirlpools , either to the largest convex set , or to its complement . the orientation for @xmath599 is the orientation used for the @xmath613 grid ( figure [ 5 * 4-c = nm - kfig ] ) .",
    "clearly , additional rows of whirlpools can be added in the bottom of the grid .",
    "we give the orientations for @xmath635 in figure [ n*m - c = nm - kfig2 ] .",
    "again , the set of black vertices is the complement of the largest set of the oriented graph . since it is easy to observe that the given orientations have the desired properties , and",
    "when we extend them the arguments remain the same , this concludes the proof ot the lemma .              as a final remark",
