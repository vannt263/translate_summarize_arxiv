    "two - electron systems present an excellent basis both for testing the new quantum calculational approaches to many - body systems and for studying a number of photo - electron and other atomic processes .",
    "this is because such systems are the simplest ones with enough complexity to contain the main features of a many - body theory .",
    "this complexity arises from the electron - electron coulomb potential which depends on the interelectronic distance @xmath2 .",
    "the proper hamiltonian for infinite nuclear mass and charge @xmath3 , in atomic units used throughout the paper , is given by @xmath4 it does not depend on any experimental constants whose values change considerably with improvements in measurement equipment .",
    "therefore , it provides a standard for theoretical calibration .",
    "it has been established @xcite that relativistic and quantum - electrodynamic corrections to the energy levels of an atomic or molecular system require highly accurate nonrelativistic wave functions .",
    "rayleigh - ritz variational calculations provide a wave function with relative error approximately proportional to the square root of the relative error in the energy . therefore",
    ", if the energies are used to estimate the quality of the wave functions , then it is necessary to calculate the nonrelativistic energies to far greater accuracy than would otherwise be needed .",
    "the alternative way for obtaining the very accurate and locally correct wave functions is a direct solution of the three - body schrdinger equation .",
    "the correlation function hyperspherical harmonic method ( cfhhm ) , employed in this paper , realizes successfully this way of solution @xcite .",
    "accuracy of the method is comparable to the most sophisticated variational calculations .    for problems in atomic or molecular physics , eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) exhibit singular behaviour at those points in configuration space where two or more charged particles come together and the resulting potential becomes infinite . for systems with zero total orbital momentum ( @xmath5-states ) the wave function depends only on three scalar variables @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i. e. , @xmath9 . at the two - particle coalescences , the derivatives of the wave function @xmath10 have discontinuities characterized by the famous kato cusp conditions @xcite , which have the simplest form for the @xmath5-state of a two - electron atomic system : @xmath11\\ ] ] @xmath12\\ ] ] @xmath13\\ ] ] the conditions ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) pertain to the situation when the coordinates of one of the electrons and the nucleus coinside .",
    "these conditions are valid for the electrons , which have the same ( triplet states ) or the opposite ( singlet states ) spin directions .",
    "the condition ( 4 ) deals with coincidence of coordinates of two electrons .",
    "it is valid only for the singlet states , while due to the pauli exclusion principle @xmath14 for the triplet states .",
    "the inclusion of functions with such cusps into trial wave functions has been shown to improve dramatically the rates of convergence of rayleigh - ritz variational calculations @xcite .",
    "the using of the proper correlation function , which obey the kato conditions ( 2)-(4 ) , accelerates considerably the convergence of cfhhm @xcite approach , as well .",
    "it is known that the cusp conditions ( 2)-(4 ) are consequences of the coulomb singularity in the potential and provide specific relations between the wave function and its first derivative at the points of coalescence .",
    "it was shown in ref . [ 5 ] that the coalescence behaviour also uniquely determines the third derivative of the spherically averaged wave function in terms of the lower derivatives .",
    "the deduced relations are valid for any atom , molecule , or electron gas in any smooth external field .",
    "there are also singularities involving more than two particle , such as the triple - coincidence singularity in the helium atom , when both electrons simultaneously approach the nucleus .",
    "a formal expansion in powers of the hyperradius @xmath15 and its logarithm @xmath16 about this singular point was proposed by fock @xcite for the @xmath5-state wave functions of the helium atom .",
    "subsequently , much efforts has been devoted to understanding this expansion .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 terms in fock s expansion are easy to obtain analytically .",
    "the @xmath20 term in the expansion has been obtained in closed form by maslen and co - workers , through the extensive use of computer algebra @xcite .",
    "myers and co - authors @xcite have examined their results , and have verified that the inclusion of this term in the expansion yields a continuous `` local '' energy , whereas the `` local '' energy is finite but discontinuous at @xmath21 if the term is omitted .",
    "forrey @xcite performed variational calculations of the ground - state energy of helium .",
    "his basis set included an explicit treatment of the fock expansion in hyperspherical coordinates and extra products of laguerre polynomials in perimetric coordinates .",
    "this work has demonstrated that the use of fock basis functions provided a substantial improvement in the convergence rate .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the calculation of the accurate wave function at the coalescence lines is a very difficult problem just because of their cusp nature . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of atomic physics problems could be solved by using the functions appearing on the rhs of eqs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) .",
    "the processes of photoionization in the helium atom and heliumlike ions @xcite could serve as an example .    it is well - known ( see , e. g.,@xcite ) , that using hamiltonian ( 1 ) we can present the schrdinger equation for @xmath5-states of two - electron atom / ions in the form @xmath22   = \\left ( \\frac{z}{r_{1}}+\\frac{z}{r_{2}}-\\frac{1 } { r_{12}}+ e \\right)\\psi .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper we provide the accurate analytic solutions of the schrdinger equation  ( 5 ) at the coalescence lines for both small and very large @xmath23 .",
    "the kato cusp conditions ( 2)-(4 ) are employed to solve the problem .",
    "to investigate the case of coalescence of one electron and the nucleus in two - electron atom / ions , one should find the limit as , e.g. , @xmath7 approaches zero for both sides of eq .",
    "it is easier to perform this mathematical operation with the help of following relations : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath27 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is clear that : @xmath30      it is seen that the lhs of eq .",
    "( 9 ) presents a sum of the form @xmath36 ,  where for the partial derivatives of @xmath10 taken at the electron - nucleus coalescence line , we have @xmath37 here @xmath38 .",
    "then , in the case of the first partial derivatives we have @xmath39 , whereas one of the numbers @xmath40 is equal to zero .",
    "let us now denote the two - electron wave @xmath5-function at the electron - nucleus coalescence line as @xmath41 so , if we could express all of the functions @xmath42 through the functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with factors being depending on @xmath23 , then we obtain an ordinary differential equation of the second order for the function @xmath43 .",
    "the prime denotes differentiation , as usual .",
    "solution of this differential equation under the proper boundary conditions could give us the desired function @xmath43 .",
    "we do not yet know how to do this in general form .",
    "however , as a first but important step we propose here a method for solving eq .",
    "( 9 ) in the boundary regions , i.e. , at very large @xmath46 and at small @xmath23 .",
    "one should notice that the numerical calculation of @xmath43 in these regions is particularly difficult .",
    "the direct correlation function hyperspherical harmonic method allows to calculate numerically the two - electron wave function @xmath47 , as well as its special case @xmath43 , with very large accuracy . by using the cfhhm numerical calculations we obtained the following limit relations between the functions mentioned above for the asymptotic region of very large @xmath23 : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53",
    "the calculations show that these relationships are valid at least to four significant digits .",
    "we can not achieve higher accuracy due to the fact that the inaccuracies of the wave functions and especially of their derivatives go up with @xmath23 .",
    "note that the asymptotic relations ( 12)-(17 ) are valid for the ground states of the two - electron atom / ions , as well as for its _ excited _ states , including _ triplet _ states .",
    "of course , we were not able to perform the proper calculations for all of the excited states .",
    "however , we could guarantee the validity of eqs .",
    "( 12)-(17 ) for several first ones .    relations ( 15)-(17 ) show that we can neglect the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the calculations of the accurate cfhhm wave functions show that the ratio of @xmath54 achieves a finite value as @xmath23 approaches infinity . in the next sections",
    "we will obtain this ratio as a finite function of @xmath3 and @xmath55 .",
    "this property together with the limit relation ( 12 ) allows us to neglect the terms proportional to @xmath56 on both sides of eq .",
    "( 9 ) . and finally , using the relations ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , eq .",
    "( 9 ) is transformed into the following simple differential equation : @xmath57 as is well known , the solution , which is convergent at @xmath58 , has the form @xmath59 the function @xmath60 is the asymptotic representation ( for very large @xmath23 ) of the accurate two - electron wave function in the situation when one of the electrons `` seats '' on the nucleus , while the other electron is far away .",
    "( 12 ) shows that this function depends on two parameters , the nuclear charge @xmath3 and the total energy @xmath55 of the two - electron atomic system .",
    "@xmath61 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we used only the accurate wave functions of the discrete spectrum ( @xmath62 ) to obtain the relations ( 12)-(17 ) .",
    "the condition of exponent in eq .",
    "( 19 ) to be real leads to the inequality @xmath63 at least for the @xmath5-states of the helium atom or heliumlike ions with the nuclear charge @xmath3 .",
    "we have calculated the cfhhm energy levels of the helium atom and the ions of li@xmath64and b@xmath65 for both the singlet and triplet @xmath5-states with @xmath66 .",
    "these data , presented in table i , confirm the validity of the inequality  ( 20 ) .",

    "the solid line describes the deviation curve for the two - exponential approximate function @xmath70 of the helium atom . for comparison",
    ", we have also drawn the corresponding one - exponential function ( 42 ) , presented by the dotted line .",
    "the graphs are limited by the value of @xmath71 a.u . , because of the very fast decay of the two - electron atomic wave functions at the electron - electron coalescence line .",
    "for example , if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) . for comparison , we can point out that the corresponding value of the wave function at the electron - nucleus coalescence line @xmath75 .",

    "demonstrate that the two - exponential function is considerably more accurate than the one - exponential one , @xmath76 .",
    "all of the approximate functions presented in this section could be employed for the evaluation of different atomic phenomena , and processes of the atomic photoionization in particular .",
    "we have considered and analyzed some particular solutions of the schrdinger equation for the two - electron atom or ion ( with the nucleus charge @xmath3 and the total energy @xmath55 ) using the accurate cfhhm wave functions .",

    "we have found that the fock s logarithmic terms vanished at the electron - nucleus coalescence line , unlike the case of the electron - electron coalescence , but only in the framework of the second order expansion .",
    "we have proposed simple two - exponential approximations for the two - electron atomic wave functions at the coalescence points .",
    "the approximations are valid for the lowest energy ( nodeless ) states .",
