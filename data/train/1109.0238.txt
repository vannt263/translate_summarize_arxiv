    "the search for the higgs boson is one of the most exciting endeavors that takes place at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . whatever its nature , the higgs resonant production can be more easily studied in the diphoton channel ( @xmath3 ) if its mass is less than about 160  gev",
    "this is so even if its branching ratio is mild , as is the standard model ( sm ) case , roughly @xmath4 for a higgs mass @xmath5  gev  @xcite .",
    "the most recent experimental results on the search for a higgs boson resonance through diphoton decay have been made available by the atlas collaboration  @xcite at cern lhc in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath7  tev , and also by the cdf and d@xmath8 collaborations  @xcite at fermilab tevatron in @xmath9 collisions at @xmath10  tev .",
    "also , the cms collaboration  @xcite has just delivered a huge analysis of their higgs search for a large range of masses , and a small excess of events is being observed in region below @xmath11  gev .",
    "the diphoton higgs decay channel also provides an excellent opportunity to test some alternatives to the sm that could be realized at the electroweak scale , and hence , be promptly probed at the current phase of lhc . since the main higgs production channel is through gluon fusion , there are some possibilities of augmenting the diphoton signal in some extensions of the sm by addition of heavy colored fields , charged under @xmath12 , and/or increase the number of heavy electrically charged vector bosons that couple to the higgs , strengthening the @xmath3 amplitude  @xcite . some explicit examples of such sm extensions are models with more fermionic generations  @xcite  gev with @xmath13  c.l .",
    "@xcite . ] , composite higgs models  @xcite , spatial extra - dimension models  @xcite , new colored scalars  @xcite , higgs impostors  @xcite , supersymmetric models  @xcite , two higgs doublets models ( 2hdm - type i ) and triplet models  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore a class of models which are based on the gauge group @xmath14 , and known as 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite .",
    "the models are modest in their departure from the sm , but have many new features that make them competitive with more daring proposals .",
    "many studies concerning signals of the new particles predicted by 3 - 3 - 1 models at current colliders have been done recently  @xcite .",
    "it is on the peculiar particle content of the 3 - 3 - 1 models that we concentrate to look for a clear signal of its lightest scalar particle , which is also contained in a doublet under the @xmath12 gauge symmetry , and is identified as the higgs boson",
    ". since we are interested in achieving some enhancement on the @xmath3 signal , the best choices among the variety of 3 - 3 - 1 model versions are the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite and its cousin that contains an exotic lepton in place of the right - handed components of the usual charged leptons , we call it exotic lepton 3 - 3 - 1 model ( el331 )  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that there are four new electrically charged vector bosons in their spectra that add to the standard @xmath15 contributions in the loop to the @xmath3 amplitude , one of them being doubly charged which further enhances the decay rate .",
    "as we shall see , the new vector bosons can have a large impact on the process in question , which also offers a way to test a mass interval for those particles if the higgs is light enough .",
    "we analyze the window on light higgs mass , @xmath16  gev , and our results show that if the @xmath17 excess is really confirmed in the next months at the cern lhc , then the 3 - 3 - 1 models with relatively light new vector bosons become a possible explanation for this beyond the sm physics signal .",
    "on the other hand , if the background hypothesis is confirmed only very heavy new vector bosons will be consistent with the experimental results .",
    "thus , the lhc will be able to place the most stringent constraints on the 3 - 3 - 1 models to date , in the light higgs mass range , ruling out portions of the model s parameter space .",
    "moreover , since these models do not bring any new contribution to the gluon fusion higgs production and our higgs boson decays into sm particles mostly as in the sm case , lhc can put important limits on these 3 - 3 - 1 models on similar grounds as for the sm , considering all assessable higgs boson decay modes .",
    "the simulations were based on partonic cross sections and nlo corrections were taken into account in the computation of all backgrounds and signals .    in the following , we define the essential aspects of the models for describing the higgs decay into two photons , the phenomenological analysis and our results .",
    "the content of quarks and vector bosons is equal for the models we deal with  @xcite .",
    "thus , we start defining the quark sector .",
    "quarks form the following representations , where the number inside parenthesis means transformation properties under @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , ( we are omitting @xmath20 color ) .",
    "left - handed quarks compose the multiplets @xmath21 @xmath22 where the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 label the quark families , with the corresponding right - handed quarks as @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the standard quarks , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 the exotic ones with electric charge @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "observe that we are omitting any superscript that would indicate that our fermions are not in a mass eigenstate basis .",
    "however , for our purposes this will be irrelevant , except that mixing would allow for some diverse phenomenological consequences not to be explored in this work .",
    "leptons do not play an essential role in our analysis here but we comment that two constructions are possible . in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model ,",
    "the standard lepton fields compose three triplets in the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and the third component @xmath38 is the charge conjugation of the charged lepton field @xmath39 @xcite . in order to generate mass to all leptons a scalar sextet",
    "would be needed  @xcite .",
    "but we disregard such a scalar sextet by taking into account that in this version lepton masses can arise through nonrenormalizable effective operators  @xcite .",
    "another possible construction for the leptons sector , which characterizes the el331 model @xcite , is such that it is composed by three leptonic triplets @xmath40 , and the right - handed singlets @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "dirac masses can be obtained for charged leptons in the el331 model by means of renormalizable operators @xcite to yield a majorana neutrino mass . ] .",
    "the gauge symmetry structure @xmath43 of the models implies the existence of nine vector bosons .",
    "the four standard ones , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath15 , and five new ones , namely , a neutral @xmath46 , two simply charged vector bosons @xmath47 , and two doubly charged vector bosons @xmath48 .",
    "these new charged vector bosons affect in an important way the contribution to the higgs width for its decay into two photons as we shall see in the next section .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to the mass generation for the vector bosons and quarks is engendered by a set of three scalar triplets , @xmath49  ( * 3*,-1 ) , @xmath50   ( * 3*,1 ) , and @xmath51  ( * 3 * , 0 ) . in order to correctly generate the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge group to the electric charge symmetry , @xmath52",
    ", we allow the neutral components of the triplets to develop vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55",
    ". we can understand this breaking as a two - step process , the first one produced by @xmath56 , breaking @xmath43 to @xmath57 symmetry , while @xmath58 and/or @xmath59 break @xmath57 to the electric charge symmetry , @xmath60 .",
    "we present in the appendix the scalar potential from which we obtain the scalar s mass eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "also , in the appendix we show the vector boson masses and the yukawa lagrangian involving the quarks .",
    "it has to be said that our results are applicable not only for the two model versions we have taken into account but also for other similar versions with different scalar particle content as well @xcite .",
    "this is because addition / subtraction of few charged scalar particles do not impact significantly the amplitude for the higgs decay into two photons .",
    "an important difference about the versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model we deal with here is on the bounds that are imposed to their vector bosons by current available data  @xcite .",
    "while these bounds can be very stringent to vector masses , @xmath61  gev , in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 due to muonium - antimuonium conversion and @xmath62  gev from the _ wrong _ muon decay @xmath63 , they may be alleviated in the el331 if these are sufficiently heavy ( few hundreds gev ) .",
    "this is because the doubly charged vector can couple to two ordinary leptons in the minimal version , and only with an ordinary plus an exotic leptons in the el331 .",
    "however , there are studies that can release the vector boson masses from such strong constraints even in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 if the scalars and mixing in the leptonic sector are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the lack of any signal from any model beyond sm gives us the freedom to choose these last possibilities as working tools to study the resonant decay @xmath3 at lhc in what follows .",
    "the higgs decay into two photons is possible through effective operators only ( loops ) and its analytical decay rate is well known for the sm  @xcite . in general , the diagrams contributing to the higgs decay amplitude into two photons are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for unspecified charged vectors , scalars and fermions .     decay amplitude in a generic model .",
    "]    we are going to specialize to the case where the higgs does not couple just proportionally to the particles masses .",
    "this happens in models with an extended scalar sector when the particle masses are generated by more than one vev , which is the case of the models we are dealing with .",
    "moreover , in these models the higgs eigenstate is a linear combination of the neutral cp - even scalars , which may diminish somehow the higgs - diphoton interaction strength . following the refs .",
    "@xcite , we can write an effective lagrangian for the higgs - diphoton interaction by first specifying the relevant interactions of the higgs field ( @xmath64 ) with fermions ( @xmath65 ) , vectors ( @xmath66 ) , and scalars ( @xmath67 ) in a general fashion as _ int & = & -(g_f)^m__i|_i_i h + 2(g_f)^m_w^2 c_v_i v_i^v_i h + & & + g^2 v_i^ * v_i h^2 -2(g_f)^m__i^2_i^ * _ i h - _i _",

    "[ lint2 ] where @xmath68 is the fermi constant , @xmath69 is the @xmath70 boson mass , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 the electroweak and scalars self couplings , respectively .",
    "the mass parameter , @xmath73 , is not generally the fermion mass , as it would be the case of sm .",
    "it only means the higgs contribution to the fermion mass in a more complex scalar sector , where the neutral scalars can mix among themselves and several vevs may appear to engender the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in other words , the higgs boson coupling to the other fields is not generally proportional to their masses .",
    "similarly , we introduce the coefficients @xmath74 for the charged vectors , so as to take account of this peculiar feature . for the present models such coefficients , under the assumptions for the vevs ( @xmath75 ) and the scalar fields self couplings as shown in the appendix ,",
    "are @xmath76 , @xmath77 . the same is true for the physical charged scalars that are not present in the sm , and @xmath78 are to be treated as parameters with squared - mass dimension , not to be identified directly with their masses . in any particular model ,",
    "all these parameters can be easily recognized and are well defined , as is our case in the 3 - 3 - 1 model . from the interaction lagrangian ,",
    "( [ lint2 ] ) , we can obtain the following effective lagrangian for the @xmath79 coupling , _ h & = & _ i ( g_f)^ h f^f _ , [ leff ] where @xmath80 is the color factor for the particle in the loop ( @xmath81 for singlet color fields ) , @xmath82 is the ratio of the electric charge of the corresponding field to the positron one , and the form factors @xmath83 are given by , f__i & = & -2__i , + f_v_i & = & c_v_i , + f__i & = & , [ fs ] where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 correspond to the masses of fermionic , vector and scalar particles , respectively , with _",

    "finally , the higgs decay rate into two photons can be obtained , _",
    "h =    sm higgs - like sector , a kind of decoupling violation occurs in the @xmath87 decay rate since the higgs couples proportionally to the particles masses and heavier particles develop a more important contribution than lighter ones . in multi - higgs scenarios , that is not completely true .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) , the vector boson couplings carry a suppression factor @xmath88 .",
    "this mass ratio suppression appears due to factoring out the fermi constant , namely , @xmath89 , in eq .",
    "( [ lint2 ] ) , diminishing the contribution from vectors much heavier than the @xmath15 . in the limiting case of heavy particles ,",
    "compared to the higgs mass , eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) can be approximated to , f__i & & - , + f_v_i & & 7 c_v_i , + f__i & & - .",
    "[ fs2 ] from this result , we can contemplate the role of new vector bosons in models beyond sm .",
    "in the 3 - 3 - 1 models , the minimal and the el331 , there are two additional singly charged , @xmath90 , and two doubly charged , @xmath91 , vector bosons , potentially increasing the signal of diphoton higgs decay .",
    "other 3 - 3 - 1 models also possess a couple of charged vectors , but the models studied here have a further factor of enhancement which is the double charge of one of these vectors , since the electric charge appears in eq .",
    "( [ largura ] ) to the fourth power .",
    "we can also observe that although scalars contribute destructively , their importance is generally marginal since for heavy scalars the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ fs2 ] ) is only a fraction of fermion and vector boson ones .",
    "therefore , scalars would compete with the vector bosons only for very light scalars and/or for too many physical scalars in the spectrum . while the latter option is not going to be the case for the 3 - 3 - 1 models here investigated ,",
    "the former could be a possible window for the charged scalar sector of the theory .",
    "we postpone this investigation for a future work though , here we restrict our analysis to portions of the parameter space where the charged scalars are not too light .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in the next section that a barely visible effect of lighter scalars shows up already for the higgs and charged vector s masses accessible for the cern lhc running at 7 tev of center - of - mass energy .",
    "the lightest neutral cp - even higgs boson of the 3 - 3 - 1 models , which we call just higgs boson for short , has the same tree - level couplings to the sm weak bosons @xmath45 and @xmath70 , leptons and quarks , as the sm higgs boson .",
    "furthermore , the higgs boson in these models lack couplings to the new heavy quarks and/or leptons ( these turn out to be singlets under the @xmath12 symmetry ) . for these reasons , the main production mode for such",
    "a higgs is the usual gluon fusion process  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the cross sections from all production modes are expected to be the same size as the sm higgs .",
    "moreover , higgs boson here should have the same branching fractions to those sm particles to which it couples at tree - level as the sm higgs .",
    "the loop - induced decays , however , receive contributions from the new scalars and vector bosons of the model .",
    "this is indeed the case for the decays @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but not for @xmath94 , once the higgs here does not couple to the new heavy quarks . as a consequence ,",
    "the total and partial widths of the 3 - 3 - 1 higgs boson are nearly identical to the sm higgs ones except for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 channels .",
    "any expected deviations from the sm case concerning the higgs boson production and decay at hadron colliders are due solely to the branching ratio into two photons and @xmath45 plus a photon , and not from the production cross sections or decays into the other channels .",
    "this interesting feature allows us , for instance , to easily apply the exclusion limits from the tevatron  @xcite recent results to the 3 - 3 - 1 models parameters space , although the present amount of data is just barely enough to constrain the model . until its closure , however , the tevatron has the potential to exclude a larger region of the 3 - 3 - 1 masses and couplings .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , the indirect bounds on the charged vector masses from muonium - antimuonium conversion and muon decays  @xcite can be evaded when the effect of the destructive interference between the scalar and vector states are properly taken into account . even in those cases where the interference is not relevant , mixing effects in the leptonic sector",
    "could weaken the couplings responsible for muonium - antimuonium conversion and muon decays .",
    "moreover , present bounds from direct searches of a @xmath97  @xcite boson may also be evaded in the case of the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : bratios ] the ratio between the branching fractions of the higgs boson into a pair of photons from the 3 - 3 - 1 model and the sm .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath92 was calculated by adapting the ` h`decay program from the formulas br_331(h ) & = & + _ 331,total & = & _ sm , total-_sm(h)+_331(h ) [ eq : br331 ] where @xmath98 was calculated at one loop - level from the contributions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and all the other partial widths calculated from ` h`decay , including qcd and ew corrections as implemented in the program .",
    "the qcd two - loop corrections to @xmath99 partial width are very small for light higgs masses ( @xmath100 )  @xcite and are not accounted for in ` h`decay , so our lo calculation has the same accuracy as the sm higgs computed by the program .    at the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bratios ] , we show the ratio as a function of the higgs mass for some charged vector masses and plot altogether the 95% c.l .",

    "for a 120 gev higgs , we see that a light vector mass results in a larger ratio as expected . for @xmath101  gev",
    ", the enhancement compared to the sm case is around a factor 3 .",
    "the decoupling behavior as the new vector boson mass increases is also evident . note that a @xmath102 amount of data will start to probe effectively the 3 - 3 - 1 parameters space .        at the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bratios ] , we display the ratio as function of the new charged vector boson mass for six different higgs boson masses .",
    "the decoupling is more visible in this plot .",
    "we also note that the tevatron already excludes very light new vector boson masses .",
    "notice that in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bratios ] a small dip , shows up for intermediate higgs masses ( @xmath103  gev ) . at the left of the dip ,",
    "the partial width into two photons increases substantially .",
    "this corresponds to the regime where the higgs can produce a pair of on - shell charged scalars , @xmath104 , as can be demonstrated writing the charged scalar masses as a function of the neutral higgs and the vector mass . at the right of the dip , the partial width increases as the mass of the charged scalars diminishes reducing the overall effect of the destructive interference between the scalar and the vector loop amplitudes",
    "however , as the masses of vectors increase , the decoupling behavior takes place , bringing the partial width closer to the sm value .",
    "the enhanced decay rate into photons is a very distinctive signature of the 3 - 3 - 1 models that can already be probed at the low luminosity runs of the cern lhc running at 7 tev of center - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the large mass spectrum of the model affects significantly the branching ratios of the light higgs boson into photons , as we discussed above .    in order to show the potential of the 7 tev lhc to probe the class of 3 - 3 - 1 models we performed a simulation of the process pph+ x [ eq : pphaa ] and the main irreducible and reducible backgrounds .",

    "the prospects for the 14  tev lhc are much more promising but we postpone this study to a future work  @xcite , where a combination with other production modes and decay channels will be performed using a multivariate analysis .",
    "meanwhile we emphasize the importance of a deeper investigation of the 3 - 3 - 1 models , and extended gauge sectors in general , to potentially explain the @xmath154 excess and the top forward / backward asymmetry reported by the tevatron collaborations in connection to the possible excess seen in the @xmath92 channel at the lhc .",
    "in this work , we investigated the potential of the 7  tev cern lhc to search for a light neutral higgs boson from 3 - 3 - 1 models in the @xmath163 channel .",
    "the presence of additional singly and doubly charged vector bosons in the @xmath99 loop enhances the higgs boson branching ratio into a pair of photons compared to the sm case .",
    "the enhancement may reach a factor @xmath0 or more depending on the new vector bosons masses .",
    "however , due to the striking capabilities of the cern lhc to detect a light higgs boson , smaller enhancement factors may be reached by the experiment , and large portions of the parameters space of these models can be probed with up to @xmath102 of integrated luminosities .",
    "for example , if @xmath164 , then charged vectors with up to @xmath165 can be discovered at the @xmath152 statistical level even for very heavy scalar masses .",
    "the potential of the lhc to exclude portions of the parameters space if no statistically significant signal is observed is far beyond the current indirect experiments . in the absence of any signal ,",
    "tev scale masses can be excluded at 95% confidence level with @xmath102 , and charged vectors with masses of several hundred gev with up to @xmath156 .",
    "a small excess of @xmath145 has been reported by the lhc collaborations  @xcite in the @xmath99 channel with @xmath166 of data .",
    "such a level of statistical excess is expected for a higgs boson from 3 - 3 - 1 models for charged vector bosons masses around @xmath150 .",
    "interestingly these masses would correspond to a @xmath167 vector boson mass in these models which can explain the observations at the tevatron of top forward / backward asymmetry as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , if a construction is possible where the new charged vector bosons are leptophobic , then a @xmath153 @xmath155 could explain the @xmath154 excess at tevatron and the @xmath145 excess in the higgs search at the lhc .",
    "we believe these coincidences are strong enough to motivate further studies for the 3 - 3 - 1 and other similar extended - gauge sector models .",
