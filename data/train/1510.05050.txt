    "constructive field theory resums perturbative quantum field theory in order to obtain a rigorous definition of quantities such as schwinger functions for interacting models @xcite .",
    "the loop vertex expansion ( lve ) is a constructive technique @xcite , improving on the traditional constructive tools in order to treat more general models with non - local interactions and/or on more general geometries .",
    "following @xcite , it can be described as a reorganization of the perturbative series , combining an intermediate field decomposition with replicas and a forest formula .",
    "it allows to write the connected schwinger functions as convergent sums indexed by spanning trees rather than as divergent sums indexed by feynman graphs .",
    "indeed a connected schwinger function @xmath2 is usually expanded in term of a feynman series as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the feynman amplitude associated to the graph @xmath5 . however , even if each of these amplitudes are ultra - violet convergent , the sum is generally badly divergent , because of the very large number of graphs of large size , so that the perturbative expansion has a zero radius of convergence in the coupling(s ) , hence @xmath6 the lve allows to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "the first step is to consider for any pair made of a connected graph @xmath5 and of a spanning tree @xmath7 in it , a universal _ non trivial weight _",
    "@xmath8 , which is the percentage of hepp s sectors of @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is leading , in the sense of kruskal _ greedy algorithm _ ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these weights , being by definition _ percentages _ , are normalized : @xmath11 they allow to rewrite the feynman expansion as a sum indexed by spanning trees : @xmath12 where : @xmath13 since trees do not proliferate as fast as feynman graphs , in good cases it can be shown that : @xmath14 at least in a certain domain that we call the _ summability domain_. strictly speaking , such a program can be achieved with standard feynman graphs only for fermionic theories , because of the pauli principle , since in that case amplitudes at same order combine into a determinant implying nice compensations @xcite . such compensations",
    "do not occur at fixed order for bosonic theories , hence the sum does not converge , even if it is repacked as a tree expansion .",
    "fortunately the loop vertex expansion overcomes this difficulty by working in another representation , called intermediate field , or hubbard - stratonovic .",
    "this representation amounts to a clever exchange of the roles of propagators and vertices .",
    "the program summarized by equations - then works , but _ for the graphs of the intermediate field representation _ , and the corresponding sum converges absolutely to the _ borel sum _ of the initial expansion .",
    "+ group field theories ( gft ) , on the other hand , are a class of field theories defined on a group manifold and characterized by a specific form of non - locality in their interactions , giving their feynman diagrams the structure of cellular complexes rather than graphs @xcite . in some recent works ,",
    "such theories appear as a promising way for research on quantum gravity .",
    "more precisely , gfts can be viewed either as a tentative to extend to higher dimensions the success of matrix models in dimension two @xcite , or as a second quantization of loop quantum gravity states because spin foams arise as feynman diagrams of gfts @xcite .",

    "_ respecting position of indices__. the same scheme is used for tgfts , the sums overs indices being replaced by integrations over group variables . for tgfts , it has been proved recently that this additional invariance allows to define a locality principe , the _ traciality _ , useful for renormalization and for importing other classical field theory tools , such as the functional renormalization group @xcite renormalization and phase transitions are at the core of the space - time emergence and _ geometrogenesis scenario _ @xcite .",

    "@xcite phase transitions @xcite and _ infrared non - gaussian fixed points _",
    "@xcite are common features of tgfts , and promising steps in the long way towards understanding semi - classical space - time .",
    "+ in this paper we propose a systematic constructive study of tgfts , starting with the simplest non - trivial model , namely tensors of rank 3 , with abelian group u(1 ) , and the simplest color - symmetric quartic interactions .",
    "we call the corresponding model the @xmath19 model . with the lve technique , we prove borel summability in the coupling constant of its free energy and connected schwinger functions .",
    "as we shall see , the _ closure constraint _ coming from the gfts origins of our model , plays an important role , because it reduces the effective intermediate fields , which are matrices , to their diagonal parts .    for more complicated tgft models which require renormalization",

    "in addition to the source terms , there are two pieces in the definition [ partitionfunc ] .",
    "the first one is the gaussian measure @xmath34 , requiring the choice of a covariance @xmath35 .",
    "the second piece is the interaction called @xmath36 .",
    "the theory is said to be ",
    "tensorial \" if these terms are invariant under independent unitary transformations on each tensor index .",
    "the only way to achieve this is that , in each terms of @xmath36 , any variable attached to a field @xmath23 is identified to another variable of a field @xmath28 _ with same position _ , and summed over the group manifold .",
    "an example in @xmath37 is : @xmath38 such a interaction , with tensorial invariance , is called _ bubble _ and a gft with interactions of this type is called a tgft .",
    "each bubble can be pictured graphically as a @xmath39-colored bipartite regular graph , where fields @xmath23 and @xmath28 are represented respectively by white and black vertices .",
    "each of these vertices are joined by @xmath16 lines , representing the group variables of the field , and the way according to which these lines are connected to the vertices follows the sums over field variables .",

    "hence a field @xmath23 is a map @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore in our model , fields are chosen to be invariant under right uniform group translation of each variable : @xmath42 this symmetry , called  closure constraint \" can be understood as a discrete gauge invariance in the language of lattice gauge theory .",
    "it comes from simplicial gravity and spin foam model , where it is interpreted as a discrete connection , and can be seen as an additional enrichment or pre - geometric data for tgfts @xcite . at the field theory level , this symmetry is implemented by the gaussian measure , and we choose the following propagator : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the heat kernel over @xmath0 , satisfying the heat kernel equation : @xmath45 we restrict to quartic interactions ( which are all automatically _ melonic _",

    "hence , we have proved the first result of this paper :    the free energy expansion is absolutely convergent for a small enough coupling .",
    "more precisely , the analyticity domain is defined by the equation @xmath243 , which , with definition [ k ] for @xmath159 , corresponds to the interior of a cardioid in the complex plane .",
    "after the convergence , we now move on to the borel summability of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the previous result shows that the first requirement of theorem [ borel ] is satisfied , because we can find a disk inside of the cardioid in which the series converge , and we will establish the second point in this section .",

    "secondly , we can perform the gaussian integration . because there are @xmath266 fields , the number of wick contractions is @xmath267 .",
    "these contractions add many intermediate loop lines to the original tree . a typical contribution to the wick contractions",
    "can be pictured as in figure [ fig9 ] below .",
    "[ fig9 ] in this picture , which is based on the tree of figure [ fig8 ] , that we call _ root tree _ , the original tree is enriched with additional loop lines coming from the wick contraction of the intermediate fields which were hidden in the tree resolvents .",
    "each vertex has coordination @xmath268 , where @xmath189 is the original number of arcs .",
    "the @xmath269 intermediate fields of a given vertex @xmath190 can be contracted together , giving tadpoles , or with the intermediate fields of others vertices , forming the loops . from lemma [ lemma1 ]",
    ", it follows that @xmath270 .",
    "moreover , the contribution of the intermediate fields is twofold .",
    "the @xmath271 decrease the weight of each vertex , and the additional lines can be viewed as constraint on the sums over @xmath193 . as a result ,",
    "all the contributions are bounded by one of the root tree , giving the bound : @xmath272^{n}\\bigg|\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\phi/2)}\\bigg|^{4n-2+(2r-2n)}\\leq 2^rr!\\bigg[\\frac{\\sup(k_1,k_2)}{\\cos^2(\\phi/2)}\\bigg]^n\\bigg|\\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\phi/2)}\\bigg|^{r-1}.\\ ] ] finally , the remaining integration over @xmath273 gives @xmath274 , which together with the denominator @xmath275 exactly compensates the combinatorial factor @xmath276 .",
    "as in the previous section , using cayley s theorem for the number of trees with @xmath118 vertices and stirling s formula , as in [ sectionconv ] , we find a bound of the form : @xmath277 for some constants @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 . because @xmath252 , summing over @xmath118 , we find the final bound : @xmath281 for the contributions in [ restf ] for which @xmath252 . as explained before , the contributions for @xmath249 are all bounded by bounds of the form : @xmath282 , and the sum behaves as : @xmath283 . ultimately , because , for positive constants @xmath284 and @xmath285 , @xmath286 , we find that @xmath287 , which corresponds to the second condition of theorem [ borel ] .",
    "it completes the proof of borel summability .",
    "schwinger functions , or connected correlation functions are obtained from the logarithm of [ intermediatevec ] by functional derivative with respect to the sources @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "only the terms with @xmath17 such source terms give a non - zero contribution .",
    "this contribution is a resolvent .",
    "the remaining terms , involving the logarithm are then derived , but the connectivity impose that the resolvent factors coming from the derivative of the source terms are derived at least one time with respect to the @xmath121 . once more , using lemma [ lemma1 ] each resolvent or derivative of resolvent can be bounded by a constant in the cardioid domain , in the same way as for the free energy , and the absolute convergence of the expansion of any schwinger function follows .",
    "we have shown that an ultraviolet convergent tgft can be successfully treated with the lve , and proved the existence of a finite analyticity domain in which perturbative expansion makes sense .",
    "as we saw , the closure constraint considerably simplified the proofs in comparison to similar works for models without this additional symmetry @xcite . hence ,",
    "if the result obtained in this paper is not very surprising , it is an encouragement for future works on more complicated tgfts with divergences and renormalization .",
    "the next step in the constructive program for tgfts should be to construct _ super - renormalizable _ theories , such as @xmath0-@xmath296 in dimension @xmath297 and @xmath0-@xmath298 in dimension 5 .",
    "such theories need only the renormalization of a finite set of divergent graphs .",
    "however , even in this simple case , taking properly into account the corresponding subtractions in a constructive way requires a refined technique , the so - called _ multi - scale loop vertex expansion _ ( mlve ) which includes a multi - scale decomposition .",
    "a further more difficult step should be the construction of a _ just - renormalizable _ tgft such as @xmath0-@xmath299 , which is asymptotically free @xcite .",
