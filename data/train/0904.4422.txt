    "ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is one of the most extensively studied binary star systems in the milky way and , although it has been the subject of many observational campaigns , the true nature ( i.e. microquasar or binary pulsar ) of the system remains unclear .",
    "the system can be classified as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) located at a distance of @xmath62 kpc ; the components of the system consisting of a compact object in a 26.496 ( @xmath70.003 ) day orbit around a massive bo ve main sequence star ( hutchings and crampton 1981 , casares et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the motion of the compact object around its main sequence companion is traditionally characterized by the orbital phase , @xmath8 , ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 .",
    "@xmath9 is set at jd 2443366.775 ( gregory and taylor 1978 ) , with periastron passage believed to occur at @xmath8=0.23@xmath10 ( casares et al . 2005 ) or @xmath8=0.30@xmath11 ( grundstrom et al .",
    "2006 ) , and apastron passage between @xmath8=0.65 and @xmath8=0.85 .",
    "historically , ls i + 61@xmath0 303 has been an object of interest due to its periodic outbursts at radio ( paredes et al .",
    "1998 , gregory 2002 ) and x - ray energies ( leahy et al .",
    "1997 , taylor et al .",
    "1996 , greiner and rau 2001 , harrison et al .",
    "the radio outbursts are well correlated with the orbital phase ( gregory 2002 ) , although the phase of maximum emission can vary between @xmath8=0.45 and @xmath8=0.95 .",
    "ls i + 61@xmath0 303 was first identified at gamma - ray energies with the cos - b source 2cg 135 + 01 ( hermsen et al .",
    "1977 ) and has also been identified with the egret source 3eg j0241 + 6103 which also shows evidence for 26.5 day modulation in the gev band ( massi 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , ls i + 61@xmath0 303 has been detected as a variable tev gamma - ray source ( albert et al .",
    "2006 , acciari et al .",
    "2008 ) with maximum emission observed near apastron",
    ".    ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is one of only three reliably detected tev binaries : the other two being ls 5039 ( aharonian et al . 2005a ) and psr b1259 - 63 ( aharonian et al .",
    "psr 1259 - 63 is a confirmed binary pulsar ( johnston et al .",
    "1992a , b ) whereas the nature of both ls 5039 and ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is still under debate .",
    "the two main competing scenarios which can explain these systems are @xmath12 ( i.e. non - thermal emission powered by accretion and jet ejection ) or @xmath13 ( i.e. non - thermal emission powered by the interaction between the stellar and pulsar winds ) .",
    "the microquasar model used to describe ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is supported by evidence for strong jet outflows ( massi 2001 ) .",
    "however , this model suffers from the failure to detect blackbody x - ray spectra expected in an accretion scenario .",
    "the microquasar scenario has not been ruled out and is still the subject of much theoretical work , for example , see romero et al .",
    "the binary pulsar model is most strongly supported by vlba data ( dhawan 2006 ) which reveal a cometary radio structure around ls i + 61@xmath0 303 that is interpreted as due to the interaction between the pulsar and be star wind structures . however , there is currently no detection of pulsed radio or x - ray emission confirming the presence of a pulsar .",

    "the xmm - newton observations also detail very fast changes of flux , with fluxes doubling over the span of 1000 seconds ( sidoli et al .",

    "this provides an indication that particle acceleration may be taking place as far away as 0.05 - 0.12 parsecs from ls i + 61@xmath0 303 .",

    "for the 2007/2008 dataset , a significant fraction of the data ( @xmath650@xmath2 ) were taken under partially moonlit sky in order to maximize the observing time .",
    "for these observations , an increased analysis threshold of 500 gev was imposed . in order to provide a more accurate comparison between the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 datasets , the 2006/2007 tev data presented in acciari et al .",

    "while we do not consider this result to be statistically significant evidence for tev emission outside of apastron passage , the excess indicates the possibility of a low level flux which warrants further investigation .    ls i + 61@xmath0 303 has been demonstrated by previous observations ( acciari et al .",

    "2009 ) to be variable tev source . to confirm this result we performed a test for the probability of the source having a constant flux over both years during which the dataset presented here was accrued .",
    "we tested 200 individual fluxes between 1@xmath2 and 20@xmath2 crab flux strength and computed the corresponding probabilities that these constant fluxes would provide a reasonable fit to the observed nightly flux upper limits and detections based on the observed excess events , livetime , and calculated effective area of each night s data .",
    "we found no probable constant flux fit to the observed data , with the best fit constant flux corresponding to a 6.3@xmath2 crab nebula flux above 500 gev .",
    "this constant flux value resulted in a reduced @xmath39 value of 4.1 ( for 55 degrees of freedom ) , corresponding to a probability of less than 10@xmath40 that ls i + 61@xmath0 303 presented a constant flux over the two years of data presented here .",
    "the x - ray flux in the 2006/2007 season , as seen by both instruments , is highly variable , ranging between approximately 0.5 @xmath41 ergs @xmath4s@xmath5 and 3 @xmath41 ergs @xmath4s@xmath5 over the 26.5 day orbit ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "similar variability is also present in the 2007/2008 dataset which also shows the presence of three exceptionally large x - ray flares , reaching a peak flux on mjd 54356.96 of 7.2@xmath41 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 during a @xmath6500 s integration window ( see figure 4 , top panel ) .",
    "this flare is the largest x - ray flare detected from this source , a factor of 2 - 3 larger than any previously measured .",
    "there were several other powerful x - ray flares occurring shortly after this flare in the rxte data .",
    "further analysis of these flares ( smith et al . 2009 ) shows that the x - ray flux from ls i + 61@xmath0 303 undergoes doubling over timescales as short as several seconds , as well as changing by up to a factor of six in several hundred seconds .",
    "this rapid variability likely explains the apparent disagreement between the rxte and swift data points in figure 4 .",
    "the fit spectra for both the rxte and swift nightly observations are also variable , with indices ranging from 1.4 to 2.6 over the span of the observations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the 2007/2008 rxte data shows that there is a strong correlation between the spectral index and flux values observed from the system ( smith et al .",
    "2009 ) , with the spectrum hardening as luminosity increases .",
    "given the indication in albert et al .",
    "( 2008 ) of a possible correlation between x - ray and tev emission , we combined both datasets in order to attempt to look for further evidence of this correlation . for the 2006/2007 observing season",
    "there were contemporaneous data for three of the five orbital cycles observed by veritas . while there were several examples of contemporaneous observations which appeared to show similar behavior in both bands , ( see , for example , observations taken between 2006/10/27 and 2006/10/30 in figure 3 ) there were also contemporaneous observations which showed elevated flux in the x - ray regime with no corresponding observed tev flux ( see , for example , observations from 2006/11/21 to 2006/11/23 ) .",
    "the 2007/2008 combined dataset showed conflicting results as well , with some contemporaneous observations showing similar behavior between the x - ray and tev bands while other observations did not .",
    "for example , the observations taken by veritas from 2007/10/28 to 2007/11/05 ( see figure 4 ) showed a 5.2 @xmath1 detection of a 6@xmath2 crab nebula flux between phases 0.7 - 0.8 , whereas only flux upper limits can be placed on emission preceding this ( phases @xmath300.5 - 0.6 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is very similar during both of these observations , which calls into question any strong correlation .    although significant tev flux detections are relatively sparse throughout both seasons , a test for any correlations present between the x - ray and tev data is performed .",
    "a z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) ( alexander 1997 ) is computed for the x - ray and tev data from both seasons .",
    "this method of correlation testing has been used before for x - ray / tev datasets in blazejowski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and was shown to be more effective in finding any present correlations than standard discrete correlation testing on datasets which are sparsely populated ( alexander 1997 ) .",
    "there are no statistically significant features present in either test . however , both tev sets are poorly sampled and it is not clear that this lack of correlation is intrinsic to the source , or due to sparse data sampling .    to examine whether or not the sampling presented here would be sufficient to detect a correlation , if one exists , we generated two continuous lightcurves with similar properties to each year s x - ray observations .",
    "each of these simulated lightcurves was then duplicated and sampled at the times corresponding to the real x - ray and tev data for each year , with the errors on the fluxes corresponding to the real errors on the tev and x - ray data . both sets of lightcurves",
    "were then tested using the zdcf test with no correlations resulting .",
    "this demonstrates that even if the tev and x - ray emission were perfectly correlated , the sampling provided by the observations detailed in this work would not result in a correlation using the methods described above .",
    "given that this correlation would not be apparent under even the best case scenario with the tev and x - ray sampling provided in this work , any claim of correlated emission between the two bands can not be justified with the currently available data .",
    "the data presented in this work show that the x - ray and tev emission from ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is highly variable over the entire accrued dataset from 2006 to 2008 .",
    "a gamma - ray signal was significantly detected over the 2006/2007 observing season during apastron passage at a peak flux level of 15 - 20@xmath2 crab nebula flux ( above 500 gev ) , and during the 2007/2008 observations at a @xmath185@xmath2 crab nebula flux during apastron passage ( above 500 gev ) .",
    "although ls i + 61@xmath0 303 has only been detected during orbital phases @xmath8=0.5 - 0.9 ( including magic observations ) , there is marginal evidence for emission outside of apastron passage as suggested by both the 2007/2008 veritas observations as well as the observations conducted by magic ( albert et al .",
    "given the relatively sparse tev data detailed in this work , we are unable to place a constraint on periodicity within the tev signal as reported in albert et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux from ls i + 61@xmath0 303 is also variable , with strong outbursts occurring at multiple regions of the orbit .",
    "the zdcf analysis of the quasi - contemporaneous x - ray and tev dataset does not show evidence for a correlation between the two bands .",
    "however , due to the lack of dense tev coverage overlapping with x - ray observations , our sensitivity to such a correlation is inadequate .",
    "more specifically , observations conducted with rxte , swift , and xmm - newton ( smith et al . 2009 , paredes et al .",
    "2007 , sidoli et al . 2006 ) show that the x - ray flux from ls i + 61@xmath0 303 can change significantly over short timescales ( up to a factor of 6 over several hundred seconds ) .",
    "if the x - ray and tev emission are indeed correlated on fast timescales , truly simultaneous coverage in both bands would be necessary to confirm this correlation .",
    "although the data presented here do not conclusively rule out or reinforce any of the proposed models ( i.e. binary pulsar or microquasar ) , the derived tev and x - ray spectra can be compared to recent model predictions from both scenarios . since both tev spectra presented here are composed of data taken over several orbital cycles",
    ", it is not possible to construct a truly simultaneous or contemporaneous spectral energy distribution for the data examined in this paper . instead , the rxte data which fell between orbital phases 0.5 and 0.8 ( the phases from which the tev spectrum was derived in both seasons ) were integrated into a single spectrum and were fit by the same procedure as described above for the nightly rxte points .",
    "this resulted in an x - ray spectrum from 3 to 10 kev , which is well fit by the power - law 5.84 ( @xmath70.06)@xmath1610@xmath42@xmath16e@xmath43 @xmath4 s@xmath5 kev@xmath5 .",
    "this spectrum is plotted along with the egret spectrum from hartmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the veritas tev spectra from acciari et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in figure 8 .",
    "an example of a binary pulsar model with a broadband sed prediction is the compactified pulsar wind scenario of zdziarski , neronov and chernyakova ( 2008 ) ( znc ) . in this model , the x - ray to tev emission",
    "is powered by inverse compton scattering off stellar uv photons by energetic electrons injected from the pulsar wind into the fast , clumpy polar wind of the be star , as well as by the more traditional binary pulsar emission mechanism of a shock front located at the interaction point of the be equatorial and pulsar winds .",
    "this model also predicts observable variations in the high - energy emission along the orbit due to accompanying density variations in the be equatorial wind , as well as inhomogeneities introduced by the mixing of the fast polar and pulsar winds .",
    "the model prediction plotted in figure 8 is a three part broken power - law ( similar to that in chernyakova et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) which represents the high x - ray state of the system .",
    "the model performs well in predicting the observed spectral energy distribution , with the resulting tev spectrum prediction of index -2.76 falling within the allowed error range of the veritas fit ( -2.40@xmath70.39@xmath22 ) .",
    "we note that in binary pulsar models the dominant emission mechanism is dictated by the magnetic field strength at the shock , which is in turn dictated by the so called `` stand - off '' distance , or the distance from the compact object to the shock front . when the stand - off distance is smallest ( i.e. when the stellar wind strength is greatest ) near periastron , the magnetic field strength is greatest , allowing the synchrotron loss channel into hard x - rays to dominate , quenching the production of tev gamma rays via the inverse - compton process .",
    "the possible existence of tev emission near periastron passage calls into question the validity of this prediction in the binary pulsar scenario .",
    "if confirmed with further observations , the appearance of periastron tev emission would necessitate modifications to this model .",
    "an example of a microquasar model which may offer an explanation for the observed emission is that of gupta and boettcher ( 2006 ) .",
    "this scenario provides a time - dependent leptonic jet framework that models synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton , and inverse - compton ( on stellar uv photons ) losses resulting from an accretion powered jet within the system .",
    "while all mechanisms contribute in varying amounts , the synchrotron contribution dominates the x - ray emission , while the inverse compton contribution ( both external compton and synchrotron self - compton ) is only significant above mev energies .",
    "( see the double humped structure in figure 8) .",
    "this model examines the hypothesis that the observed tev variability may be able to be interpreted solely as a geometrical effect arising from absorption in the dense photon field of the star .",
    "the regions of highest tev production , therefore , are those that have limited exposure to this dense absorption field such as the @xmath8=0.5 orbital region which is plotted in figure 8 .",
    "as can be seen , while the synchrotron contribution adequately reproduces the observed x - ray spectrum , the inverse compton contributions underproduce both the egret and veritas spectra , predicting a cutoff at a few tev .",
    "this fit could most likely be improved , however , if the constraint of absorption being the only contributing factor to the tev variability was removed .",
    "given the possible existence of tev emission outside of apastron passage , this would seem to be a necessary modification .",
    "recently , swift - bat has reported the detection of a short ( 0.23 s ) , extremely powerful x - ray burst with a luminosity of 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath5 in the 15 - 150 kev energy range within the 90@xmath2 containment radius of ls i + 61@xmath0 303 ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2008 ) . while barthelmy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) notes the possibility that this emission episode was due to an unrelated short gamma - ray burst , they claim that the evidence is in favor of activity from a source within ls i + 61@xmath0 303 ( barthelmy et al .",

    "( 2008 ) by dubus and giebels ( 2008 ) interprets this burst as evidence for magnetar activity within ls i + 61@xmath0 303 , the first within a high mass x - ray binary .",
    "if confirmed by subsequent observations , this type of extremely powerful bursting may help to resolve the question of the identification of ls i + 61@xmath0 303 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the multiwavelength observations reported here demonstrate clear variability of ls i + 61@xmath0 303 in the high energy regime , however , the tev data has insufficient sampling to constrain the correlation between the x - ray and tev bands . additionally , while neither conclusively ruling out nor confirming either the microquasar or binary pulsar scenarios , the observations reported here show marginal evidence for tev emission near periastron passage , a feature which , if confirmed , may be necessary to incorporate into future models .",
    "future simultaneous , multiwavelength observations with instruments such as veritas and magic in the tev regime , combined with gev observations by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , and x - ray monitoring by various instruments will aid in the deeper understanding of this unpredictable and exciting source .",
