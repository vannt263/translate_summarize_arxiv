    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is a potentially powerful observational tool for cosmology .",
    "it is a small distortion in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum caused by scattering of cmb photons off a distribution of high energy electrons in dense structures such as clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this effect has the unique property that its signal is independent of redshift , making it particularly well suited for deep cluster surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the next generation of sze instruments , such as the south pole telescope ( spt ) and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , should be capable of mapping a fairly large portion of the sky and finding a large number ( @xmath2 ) of clusters out to high - redshift .",
    "such large and homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters will enable direct and precise measurements of their number density as a function of redshift , and the expected survey yields will be sufficient to provide one of the most powerful constraints on the nature of dark energy @xcite .    to realize the full statistical power of the upcoming sze surveys , however , systematic uncertainties would have to be controlled at a level comparable to statistical uncertainties .",
    "one of the main sources of the systematic uncertainties lie in the relation between the sze observable and cluster mass as a function of redshift .",
    "making this connection is important because the cluster mass is not directly observable . for the future sze surveys ,",
    "the requirement is to control systematic uncertainties in the sze observable - mass relations to better than @xmath35% at all redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this poses a serious challenge to both observers and theorists . to date",
    ", observational studies of the sze scaling relations have been performed using two largest datasets of sze measurements obtained by the ovro / bima cm - wave imaging experiment @xcite and multiband suzie experiment @xcite along with x - ray observations . analyzing a sample of 36 clusters observed with both the ovro / bima sze imaging and _ chandra _ x - ray observations",
    ", @xcite showed that there are tight correlations between the observed sze flux and x - ray temperature and cluster masses .",
    "the observed regularity of the sze effect of clusters is encouraging news , but further progress is clearly needed for the future sze surveys .",

    "one of the main results is that a sze signal integrated to a sufficiently large fraction of cluster volume is an extremely good proxy for its enclosed mass , independent of details of gas physics and dynamical state of a cluster ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the slope and the redshift evolution of the sze scaling relation also appear to be insensitive to details of cluster gas physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while these results are encouraging for cosmological applications , these previous studies have focused on simulating a large number of clusters , and the resolution was inevitably limited to capture relevant cluster physics . as such , the impact of galaxy formation on normalization of the sze scaling relations has not yet converged among different simulations .",

    "in this section , we study the impact of galaxy formation on the sze scaling relations using cosmological simulations of cluster formation . our general strategy is to assess their effects on cluster observables and scaling relations by comparing two sets of simulations with and without processes important for galaxy formation .",
    "since the thermal sze is sensitive to the pressure of the icm , we will start with the analysis of pressure profiles of clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows a comparison of the mean pressure profiles of clusters simulated in the adiabatic regime and those with gas cooling and star formation at @xmath22=0 and @xmath22=1 . to compute the mean profiles , we first normalize differential and cumulative pressure profiles of individual clusters using the mean integrated pressure within a sphere of @xmath112 , denoted as @xmath115 , and plot them as a function of the cluster - centric radius in units of @xmath112 .",
    "the mean profiles are computed by averaging the normalized profiles over the entire cluster sample . to highlight the impact of gas cooling and star formation on the pressure profiles , we normalize the pressure profile of the csf run using @xmath115 of the ad run for each cluster .",
    "the shaded bands show @xmath116 rms scatter around the mean profile of the csf runs .",
    "the mean and scatter of the profiles are computed for a logarithm of pressure .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] illustrates that clusters ranging in an order of magnitude in mass exhibit remarkably similar pressure profiles at all radii .",
    "the differential pressure profile declines by nearly four orders of magnitude from the center to @xmath112 , and the scatter is small ( @xmath117 ) throughout clusters . in the outskirts ,",
    "the radial profile of gas pressure generally falls faster than that of gas or dark matter density .",
    "this is because pressure is a product of gas density and gas mass - weighted temperature for the ideal gas , and the latter also declines with radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a typical power - law slope of the differential pressure profile is @xmath118 at @xmath112 , which is steeper than a typical slope of the density profile of @xmath119 seen in cosmological simulations @xcite as well as recent x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "one of the main results from this analysis is that gas pressure is suppressed in a region outside @xmath120 in the csf runs compared to the ad runs . the cumulative pressure at @xmath112 , for example ,",
    "is suppressed by @xmath121 on average , and this effect is relatively constant ( @xmath122 ) in a region outside @xmath123 at @xmath22=0 . in the center ,",
    "gas pressure is significantly more concentrated , because of strong gas cooling and contraction of dark matter @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this high pressured cluster core contributes very little to the cumulative pressure at large radii . for example , the inner regions within @xmath124 contribute less than 2% of the total sze signal within @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the sze signal integrated out to a sufficiently large radius is insensitive to properties of cluster cores .",
    "although general trends are similar , the suppression of gas pressure varies more strongly with radius at @xmath22=1 , because a dense , cool core dominates a larger fraction of @xmath112 at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the suppression of the cumulative pressure at @xmath112 is comparable at @xmath22=0 and 1 .",
    "however , the difference becomes more apparent in the inner region ; for example , the effect at @xmath125 changes from 35% at @xmath22=0 to 20% at @xmath22=1 .",
    "if a similar trend exists in real clusters this implies that redshift evolution of the sze scaling relations is expected to deviate from the prediction of the self - similar model , if the sze flux is computed within the aperture considerably smaller than @xmath112 .    in order to better understand the suppression of gas pressure",
    ", we examine the impact of gas cooling and star formation on density , temperature and entropy profiles of the icm .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles_comp ] shows that the suppression of pressure is accompanied by strong suppression in gas density and moderate increase in gas mass - weighted temperature .",
    "an entropy profile provides further insights into these phenomena , because it uniquely characterizes thermodynamic properties of the icm , given a shape of its confining potential well ( see voit et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "[ fig : profiles_comp ] shows that the entropy of the icm , defined as @xmath126 , is enhanced from @xmath127 out to @xmath128 .",

    "star formation can increase the entropy of the gas in one of two ways : ( 1 ) the level of entropy is elevated throughout as gas cooling and star formation proceed in the cluster center @xcite or ( 2 ) direct heating of the icm by energy injection from supernova explosions .",
    "the former is likely a dominant mechanism that shapes the overall entropy distribution , while the second process is important for regulating a rate of gas cooling in high density regions ( e.g. , a vicinity of a central galaxy and cluster galaxies ) , where stars are forming with sufficiently high rates .    to examine a mass dependence of the effects ,",

    "the net effect is a reduction of the sze signal by 32% , which falls slightly short of a 34% change in the normalization of the sze - m relation .",
    "this illustrates that changes in @xmath34 and @xmath145 alone do not fully account for the change in normalization .",
    "in addition , gas cooling and star formation slightly modify the total cluster mass .",

    "the effect becomes larger at a smaller radii , and it is about 10% at @xmath125 .",
    "this effect causes shifts in the sze - m relation in both x- and y - directions by the same amount .",
    "however , since the slope of the relation is @xmath1475/3 , the 6% shift in the positive x - axis translates into a 8% shift in the negative y - axis . the net effect is therefore a negative 3% change in normalization due to the change in @xmath146 .",
    "putting them all together , we find that the 34% decrease in normalization of the sze - m relation at @xmath112 is due to combined effects of the 38% decrease in @xmath34 , the 9% increase in @xmath33 and the net 3% decrease in normalization due to the change in @xmath146 .",

    "note that the change in the normalization of the sze-@xmath149 relation has an opposite sign from the change in the sze - m relation , because gas cooling and star formation significantly reduce cluster gas mass .",
    "recall that the inclusion of these physical processes reduces the sze signal by 29% and @xmath149 by 35% at @xmath112 . for the slope of 5/3 ,",
