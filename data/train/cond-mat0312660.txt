    "on the first look , the phase diagram of the high transition temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprates has a striking simplicity : there are only three universal phases in the phase diagram of all htsc cuprates : the antiferromagnetic ( af ) , the superconducting ( sc ) and the metallic phases , all with _ homogeneous _ charge distributions . however , closer inspection shows a bewildering complexity of other possible phases , which may or may not be universally present in all htsc cuprates .",
    "a large class of these phases have inhomogeneous charge distributions .",
    "because of this complexity , formulating an universal theory of htsc is a great challenge .",
    "the @xmath1 theory unifies the af and the sc order parameters into a single five dimensional order parameter called the superspin , and the effective quantum theory of the superspin naturally explains proximity between the af and the sc phases in the observed phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the goldstone modes of the superspin fluctuations can be identified with the @xmath2 resonance mode observed in the neutron scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "this theory also predicts the af vortex state@xcite , which has recently been observed in a number of experiments@xcite .",
    "initially , the @xmath1 theory was motivated by the simplicity of the pure af and sc states , however , given the encouraging agreements with the experiments , it is tempting to construct an unified theory of the global phase diagram of the htsc which addresses the more complex inhomogeneous phases as well .",
    "complexities can of course be introduced phenomenologically into the landau - ginzburg type of theories by simply introducing more order parameters .",
    "however , this type of approach necessarily limits the predictive power of theory .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a single effective quantum model of the superspin degree of freedom , which can be derived systematically from the microscopic electron models , and can be investigated reliably both analytically and numerically .",
    "the global phase diagram of this model is then compared with the experimentally observed phase diagram of the htsc cuprates .    when formulated on a coarse - grained lattice , with high energy charge states projected out , the projected @xmath1 model describes five local superspin degrees of freedom per plaquette@xcite .",
    "these five states are the spin singlet state at half - filling , the spin triplet states at half - filling , and the singlet d - wave hole pair state . using the contractor renormalization group ( core ) algorithm , altman and",
    "auerbach@xcite showed that the projected @xmath1 model can be systematically derived from the microscopic electron models , and they also determined the parameters of the effective @xmath1 model explicitly from the microscopic interaction parameters ( see also ref .",
    "[ ] ) . restricted within the subspace of these five local states , the hamiltonian describing their propagation and interaction is completely expressed in terms of bosonic operators and can be studied reliably by the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations .",
    "the simplest form of the projected @xmath1 model has been studied extensively by the qmc method both in two dimensions @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the overall topology of the phase diagram , the scaling properties near the multi - critical point and the nature of the collective excitations can be reliably obtained from the qmc method , within the parameter regime of experimental interests .",
    "the simplest form of the quantum @xmath1 model describe either the direct , first order transition from the af to the sc state , or two second order transitions with an uniform , intermediate af / sc mix phase in between the pure af and the sc states@xcite . in the case of the direct first order transition as a function of the chemical potential , the system at a fixed density is phase separated .",
    "however , in the htsc cuprates , there are other forms of charge and spin ordered states . for example , neutron scattering cross section in @xmath3 material is peaked around @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6@xcite .",
    "stm experiments have revealed periodic charge modulation with period close to four lattice spacing@xcite , either near the vortex core or near surface impurities . in latter case , alternative interpretation@xcite based on quasi - particle interference is also possible , and the two points of views are summarized by kivelson _",
    "et al_.@xcite . motivated by these experiments ,",
    "we extend the simplest form of the projected @xmath1 model to include extended interactions among the five bosonic states .",
    "in fact , these extended interactions also arise naturally by carrying out the core algorithm to extended ranges .",
    "the projected @xmath1 model with extended interactions support a more complex phase diagram .",
    "in particular , there are insulating phases at fractional filling factors where the charges form a lattice , usually commensurate with the underlying lattice .",
    "a crucial aspect of this model is that all charge density wave states are formed by the cooper pairs of the holes , rather than the holes themselves@xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall denote such states as the pair - density - wave ( pdw ) states or pair checkerboard states .",
    "this distinction has a profound experimental consequence , since the real space periodicity of the former is larger than the latter by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "this type of insulating pdw states is a consequence of strong pairing and low superfluid density , a condition which is naturally fulfilled in the underdoped cuprates , but has not yet been unambiguously identified in other experimental systems before .",
    "the pdw state can either take the form of stripes or checkerboards , depending on the ratios of the extended interaction parameters in the model .",
    "furthermore , pdw states with longer periodicity generally requires longer range interactions to stabilize .",
    "based on this reasoning , a simple picture emerges for the global phase diagram of underdoped cuprates .",
    "the phase diagram consists of islands of insulating pdw states , each with a preferred rational filling fraction , immersed in the background of sc states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - types ] ) . the height of the mott insulating pdw lobes vary depending on the preferred filling fraction and the range of extended interactions , but in principle , these insulating states are all self - similar to each other , and similar to the parent af insulator at half - filling",
    ". there can be either a direct first order phase transition , or two second order phase transitions between the sc state and the pdw state , with the possibility of an intermediate  supersolid \" phase , where both orders are present .",
    "based on our model , the bewildering complexity of the cuprate phase diagram can be deduced from a simple principle of the  law of corresponding states \" .",
    "this concept is borrowed from the work of kivelson , lee and zhang on the global phase diagram of the quantum hall effect@xcite , in fact , our proposed phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig - types ] bears great similarity to fig . 1 of that reference .",
    "in the case of the qhe , the  law of corresponding states \" physically relates _ all _ quantum phase transitions at various filling fractions to a _",
    "single _ quantum phase transition from the @xmath8 integer state to the hall insulator . in recent years , this powerful mapping among the different fractional states has been made more precise by the derivation of the @xmath9 discrete modular group transformation from the chern - simons theory@xcite . similarly , the central idea of the current paper is to relate the fractional mott insulator to sc transition with the transition from the af mott insulator at half - filling to sc state , which is already well understood within the context of the original , simple @xmath1 theory .",

    "the various different compounds of the htsc cuprates families have slightly different microscopic parameters , and they correspond to different slices of this global phase diagram .",
    "the global phase diagram provides a basic road - map to understand the common elements and differences among various htsc compounds .",
    "this paper mainly focuses on the zero temperature global phase diagram of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "however , it is understood that the model is valid below the pseudogap temperature , which we interpret as the temperature below which the system can be effectively described by the collective bosonic degrees of freedom , like the magnons and the hole pairs .",
    "therefore , it is implied that the pseudogap state is a regime where the various ground states discussed here compete with each other , and different experiments may access different aspects of these competing states .",
    "the existence of the pseudogap temperature gives the fundamental experimental justification to investigate the global phase diagram of the underdoped cuprates by a purely bosonic model . in the future",
    ", we shall use the same model to investigate the manifestations of these competing states at finite temperature , in the pseudogap regime .",
    "a comparison of the charge order predicted by this work and the stm experiment in the pseudogap regime has recently been reported in ref .",
    "while this paper is presented within the logical context of the @xmath1 theory , some of the ideas and results bear intellectual similarities to the previous theoretical works .",
    "the idea of doped holes forming ordered stripes has been discussed extensively in ref .",
    "although we focus more on the charged ordered states in the forms of checkerboards of hole pairs , they are conceptually related to stripes and can be realized experimentally or theoretically depending on the microscopic parameters .",
    "the pseudogap temperature was identified as the formation temperature of cooper pairs by emery and kivelson@xcite .",
    "our interpretation of the pseudogap temperature is more general , which also includes the formation of the magnetic collective modes in addition to the holes pairs .",
    "vojta and sachdev@xcite have discussed the phase diagram of doped mott insulator with various charge ordered insulating states at rational fractions .",
    "more recently , zhang , demler and sachdev have studied extensively the competition among charge and spin order@xcite .",
    "laughlin pointed out that the small superfluid density in the underdoped regime is responsible for various charge ordering phenomena@xcite .",

    "the qualitative features found at the mean - field level are still present in a full numerical calculation and we have a very nice overall agreement ( see fig .  [ fig - phase - mf ] and  [ fig - phase - qmc ] ) .",
    "of course , exact critical values of @xmath34 for superconducting - insulator transition are different from mean - field values but this does not change the physical conclusions .",
    "it is very difficult to point precisely where af vanishes since spin stiffness does not show any sharp drop .",
    "however , we clearly see a strong reduction of @xmath250 , which seems to decrease linearly with doping . with the chosen parameters",
    ", it seems plausible that both this line and the pdw transition line merge close to the tip of the @xmath251 lobe as was found at the mean - field level .",
    "this result was associated to the dynamical restoration of @xmath1 symmetry at this point .",
    "our data might be an indication that this is indeed the case ( we have taken the same @xmath53 and @xmath54 so it seems pretty robust ) .",
    "however , a complete answer can only be provided by computing dynamical correlations , which is more involved and require good statistics .",
    "in this work we have constructed a single quantum hamiltonian based on the projected @xmath1 model with extended interactions , and presented detailed analytical and numerical calculations which give a consistent global phase diagram as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - types ] .",
    "this schematic phase diagram is obtained from the quantitative model calculations summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig - phase - mf ] and [ fig - phase - qmc ] .",
    "this model captures the overall topology of the cuprates phase diagram , including the dome - like feature of @xmath0 , which is determined within our model by the superfluid density , the @xmath105 anomaly due to charge ordering , the coexistence of sc with af and possibly with charge order . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "some of these features have been discussed in other theoretical contexts before , however , it is rather remarkable that they are all reproduced by a single quantum model accessible by reliable qmc .",
    "below we shall discuss some of these features and present more detailed theoretical predictions .",
    "a remarkable feature of the htsc cuprates is the dome - like dependence of @xmath0 on doping .",
    "experiments have also shown a remarkable dependence of superfluid density on doping .",
    "on the underdoped side , both @xmath0 and the superfluid density scales linearly with doping , a fact commonly referred to as the  uemura plot \" .",
    "further examination also shows that the superfluid density in the overdoped regime decreases with increasing doping , which is commonly referred to as the  boomerang effect \" . in cuprate system ,",
    "the muon spin relaxation rate @xmath252 is proportional to @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the superfluid density and @xmath255 is the effective mass of hole - pairs@xcite . to explain the deviation from the linear relation between @xmath71 and doping in the overdoped regime , uemura proposed that some of the doped holes do not form pairs and are phase separated from the sc hole - pairs , even at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "a similar phase separation picture was proposed by uchida@xcite .",
    "however , it has always been rather puzzling that if the phase separated normal electrons existed at zero temperature , they should provide a channel of relaxations , which has not been observed experimentally .    within our effective bosonic model , @xmath0",
    "is directly determined by the superfluid density @xmath212 . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] , @xmath212 indeed scales linearly with the doping density for small doping , and has a dome - like dependence for higher doping for intermediate values of @xmath34 .",
    "it peaks around @xmath256 for @xmath257 .",
    "the physical reason for the behavior on the overdoped side arises from the tendency of hole pairs to form a competing charge ordering state at either @xmath258 or @xmath259 . within this picture , when more holes are added into the system on the overdoped side , the holes are still paired , but some of them form a charge ordered pdw state , with preferred doping of @xmath258 or @xmath259 .",
    "this charge ordered pdw state either phase separate from the sc state , or coexists with it , but either way , the superfluid density is reduced because of the repulsive coupling between the two forms of order .",
    "therefore , this picture predicts a new charge ordered state on the overdoped side , which should be tested experimentally .",
    "since the magnon density decreases monotonically with doping , the charge ordered states on the overdoped side may not be af ordered , which makes it hard to observe by neutron scattering .",
    "furthermore , on the overdoped side , our purely bosonic model also becomes less accurate , and a fully quantitative theory has to include the low energy fermionic excitations .      in the @xmath3 systems",
    ", @xmath0 has a pronounced dip near doping of @xmath154@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been demonstrated that the competition between the nearly insulating @xmath105 phase and the sc phase in @xmath3 family can be controlled by pressure .",
    "there are two different approaches .",
    "one is to apply hydrostatic or uniaxial pressure on single crystal@xcite . in this way",
    ", the pressure in @xmath260 plane increases @xmath0 while the pressure in @xmath261 direction decreases @xmath0 .",
    "the other is to introduce compressive or expansive strain into thin films with the help of the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate@xcite .",
    "enhanced @xmath0 and disappearance of the @xmath105 anomaly for compressed film and strong reduction of @xmath0 for expanded film were observed@xcite .",
    "our model reproduces the @xmath154 effect for @xmath262 , as one can see from fig . [",
    "fig : sc ] .",
    "the pronounced dip is caused from the competition between the sc state and the insulating pdw states .",
    "varying doping correspond to the  b2 \" or ",
    "b3 \" traces as depicted in fig . [ fig - types ] . on the other hand , pressure in the @xmath260 plane reduces the lattice constant , thus increases the hopping term @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , applying pressure in the @xmath260 plane is equivalent to following a  class a2 \" trace starting from a small @xmath34 in the global phase diagram . the doping dependence of @xmath0 for different films given in fig . 3 of sato _ et al_@xcite shares many common features with our doping dependence of sc order parameter , both mf results ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sc - mf ] ) and qmc results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] ) . the destructive effect on @xmath0 of the pressure in the @xmath261-direction",
    "can also be understood in terms of the poisson effect .",
    "the lattice constant in @xmath260 plane will increase when the sample is compressed in the @xmath261 direction .",
    "this will lead to the decrease of @xmath0 as argued previously .",
    "similar to the  class a2 \" trace , ",
    "class a3 \" trace can also be realized by applying pressure .",
    "therefore , we predict a similar pressure induced superconductor - to - insulator transition at @xmath104 .    in this way , the pressure effect on the @xmath105 anomaly is understood in terms of the bosonic superfluid - to - insulator transition at the fixed density of @xmath154 .",
    "standard predictions on the superfluid - to - insulator transition applies to the @xmath154 transition .",
    "in addition , we argued that the tip of the @xmath154 lobe can possibly have the full quantum @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this prediction can be experimentally tested by comparing both the static and dynamic charge and magnetic responses , as we have discussed in section ii.b .",
    "the  class a2 \" and  class a3 \" traces can also be approached in the cuprates by applying a magnetic field along the @xmath261-axis , which effectively reduces the hopping term @xmath34 . in underdoped @xmath3 samples",
    ", we predict that the magnetic field destroys sc order by localizing hole - pairs into a pdw state .",
    "this naturally leads to the field - induced insulating behavior in underdoped @xmath3@xcite . for the @xmath138 and @xmath108 systems",
    ", the magnetic field could drive the hole - pairs into a disordered state before the lobe of @xmath154 or @xmath104 is reached .",
    "recently , a striking feature is revealed in the stm experiments by hoffman _",
    "et al._@xcite , where the local density of states ( dos ) near the vortex core show a two dimensional checkerboard - like modulation with a @xmath264 charge unit cell . here",
    "@xmath265 is the lattice spacing of the @xmath266 plane .",
    "this modulation decays exponentially away from the center of the vortex core , with a decay length of about @xmath267 .",
    "a similar pattern has also been seen in the absence of the applied magnetic field@xcite , possibly induced by the impurities at the surface . in the case of vortex core experiment ,",
    "sc is destroyed by the magnetic field , and the nature of the competing state is revealed .",
    "the case of impurity scattering is more complex , and the experimental observation can also be interpreted as due to quasi - particle interference@xcite .",
    "the @xmath154 insulating pdw state was proposed as an explanation for the stm measurements@xcite .",
    "this state has the @xmath264 checkerboard symmetry as observed in the experiment , and the doping level for the insulating @xmath154 state is reasonably close to the optimal doping level of the cuprates .",
    "on the other hand , if the holes themselves , rather than the hole pairs , form a wigner crystal state , the periodicity of the charge ordering would be larger by a factor of @xmath7 , inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "therefore , by forming the wigner crystal state of the hole pairs rather than the holes themselves , the doping level can be compatible with the observed size of the charge unit cell . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the hole pair checkerboard state was established by a mean field calculation . a main result of the present work is to establish the existence of this state by qmc calculations .",
    "our calculations as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig - phase - mf ] and [ fig - phase - qmc ] show that the charge ordered insulating states are also accompanied by af magnetic order . enhanced af fluctuation in the vortex state",
    "was originally predicted within the @xmath1 theory in ref .",
    "[ ] , and has been experimentally observed in a number of htsc cuprate families by a variety of experimental techniques@xcite .",
    "more recently , af order has been detected by neutron scattering above @xmath263 , in electron doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "this magnetic field induced quantum phase transition from the sc state to the af state correspond to the  a2 \" trace as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - types ] .      in previous subsections",
    ", we argue that the competition between pdw and sc can be tuned by applying pressure or magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we show that the pdw ordering of hole - pairs can develop in the vortex core .",
    "the localized hole - pairs in a pdw state are expected to have little contribution to the transport properties such as thermal conductivity .",
    "this leads to the argument of the suppression of thermal conductivity by applying a magnetic field in @xmath261-axis below some temperature @xmath268 .",
    "since the onset temperature @xmath268 is expected to be proportional to the superfluid density , @xmath268 has weak dependence on the magnetic field and follows @xmath0 in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "moreover , the closer the system is to the charge ordered insulating state such as the @xmath105 pdw state , the smaller the suppression effect would be .",
    "finally , the in - plane magnetic field has little effect on the thermal conductivity due to the fact that it does not create vortex in the @xmath260 plane .",
    "therefore , trace  a2 \" in our global phase diagram and the charge localization into a hole pair crystal can possibly explain the recent experiment on the suppression of thermal conductivity by applying a magnetic field in @xmath261-direction@xcite .",
    "we also predict that applying pressure will also induce the suppression or enhancement of the thermal conductivity around the @xmath105 doping , assuming the pressure will not induce strong effect of the lattice structure which can also change the thermal conductivity .",
    "as discussed in section [ section - heuristic ] , additional insulating lobes at @xmath104 and @xmath106 doping levels are predicted if interactions are more extended than the nnn interactions included in this work .",
    "the charge and spin ordering patterns for this state are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - diagonal - stripe ] .",
    "even though the current paper does not investigate this type of more extended interactions explicitly due to numerical complexities , it is clear that the physics of these pdw states are similar to the @xmath105 doping .",
    "preliminary evidence for the @xmath104 insulating state exists for the @xmath3 material@xcite . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig - diagonal - stripe ] and [ fig - inphase - stripe ] , the charge ordering pattern rotates from diagonal at @xmath104 to square at @xmath154 .",
    "this transition between states with different rotational symmetries could possibly be related to the diagonal to square transition observed in the neutron scattering experiments at @xmath269 in the @xmath3 material@xcite .    .",

    "the accompanied af magnetic order is commensurate , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig - inphase - stripe ] .",
    "this type of magnetic structure is consistent with the recently observed field induced magnetic order in the @xmath140 material@xcite , but not consistent with the magnetic structure observed in the @xmath3 material , which has anti - phase domain walls .",
    "we would like to stress that this is not a limitation on the fundamental approach taken here . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - magnetic - stripe ] , checkerboard charge order of the hole pairs can be fully consistent with the af magnetic structure with anti - phase domain walls .",
    "however , stability of this type of magnetic structure requires more extended magnetic interactions .",
    "since the complexity of both the core algorithm and the qmc increases substantially , we have not yet been able to derive such extended interactions from the microscopic models , and simulate them with qmc .",
    "while the simple @xmath1 model@xcite predicts the coexistence phases of af and sc , more regions with coexisting charge , af and sc orders are predicted in the global phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig - phase - mf ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - phase - qmc ] .",
    "in particular , the  type 1 \" first order transition from undoped af state to sc state predicted by simple @xmath1 model is turned into two  type 2 \" second order transitions by the interactions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which is consistent with previous study@xcite . while the width of these coexistence regions is model dependent , coexistence phases are important qualitative predictions of our theory .",
    "experiments on cuprates have indeed suggested such coexistence phases@xcite .    as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig - af - mf ] , the af order disappears around @xmath270 .",
    "this is consistent with the value obtained from the @xmath10-@xmath11 model@xcite .",
    "the width of the af / sc coexistence phase largely depends on the values of @xmath55 and @xmath58 . as determined by core method , @xmath55 is negative and @xmath58 is positive .",
    "thus , at the mean - field level , both @xmath55 and @xmath58 terms induce a repulsion between af and sc in the mixed state of coexisting af and sc .",
    "when these terms are included , one would expect a smaller region of the af / sc coexistence state of in the global phase diagram .",
    "on the other hand , these two terms have different effects on the checkerboard state .",
    "since the mean - field value of @xmath2-operator in the pdw state is zero , the @xmath55 interaction will not induce any interaction terms at the mean - field level .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath58 term effectively changes the local chemical potential of hole - pairs ( magnons ) due to the nonzero mean - field value of magnons ( hole - pairs ) on nn plaquette .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 also reduces the height of the insulating pdw lobe .",
    "starting from commonly used microscopic models of high @xmath0 cuprates , an effective bosonic model can be derived by the core algorithm@xcite .",
    "in addition to the simple interactions included in the original projected @xmath1 model@xcite , extended interactions play an important role in determining the global phase diagram of the model . this model can be studied systematically by the analytical mean field theory and by the qmc method , thanks to the absence of the minus sign problem .",
    "the global phase diagram consists of self - similar insulating pdw phases at rational filling fractions , immersed in the background of the uniform sc phase , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig - types ] .",
    "different families of cuprates are attributed to different traces in the global phase diagram .",
