    "strong maser radiation has been detected in various astronomical environments , from nearby starforming regions to distant galactic nuclei .",
    "the extremely high brightness temperature of astronomical masers allows very high angular resolution observations to study the kinematics and physical properties of the masing environments ( reid & moran 1981 ) .",
    "it has been recognized that maser radiation is generally polarized , either linearly or circularly . in some cases",
    "the polarization degrees up to 100% have been observed . because polarization of the radiation field is related to spatial anisotropy , i.e the presence of a strong and ordered magnetic field , maser radiation holds the promise of providing valuable information on the elusive magnetic field . + a complete understanding of the mechanism to generate polarization of maser emission is essential to interpret observational results and to infer the physical properties , such as magnetic field direction and strength , in the maser environment .",
    "theoretical study of astronomical masers started with the work of litvak ( 1970 ) .",
    "subsequently goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) worked out the basic model of maser polarization for the j=10 transition .",
    "their work predicts that , in the presence of a strong magnetic field , radiation from saturated masers is linearly polarized , reaching a limit of q / i=@xmath31 for @xmath4 and ( 3@xmath5)/3@xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "however , the result is derived only for the case of a fully saturated maser and the question of how that limiting polarization is reached for any real astronomical maser remains open .",
    "numerical studies by western & watson ( 1984 ) , deguchi & watson ( 1990 ) and nedoluha & watson ( 1990 ) provide the dependence of fractional linear polarization on the saturation parameter r/@xmath8 , the ratio between the stimulated emission rate r and the loss rate @xmath8 .",
    "numerical results show that for the j=10 transition , the linear polarization increases slowly toward the limiting solution , and for higher lying rotational transitions such as j=21 , the limiting polarization predicted by goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) can only be attained in the fully saturated regime , namely r/@xmath8 @xmath9 100 or even higher .",
    "observationally , such high intensities are almost impossible to be realised in astronomical masers .",
    "more detailed calculations by deguchi & watson ( 1990 ) , taking into account population mixing between magnetic sub - levels in the regime of large stimulated emission rate , actually predict that the polarization fraction decreases and disappears at high enough intensity .",
    "thus , the limiting polarization can never be reached in high lying transitions such as j=21 .",
    "+ observationally , sio maser lines in vibrationally excited state @xmath10 , such as j=32 and even j=54 , from evolved stars have been known to possess large linear polarization ( mcintosh & predmore 1993 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is often cited ( elitzur 1993 , 1995 ) as deficiency of the framework under which previous numerical studies are carried out .",
    "recently , in a series of papers ( elitzur 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ) a different model of the maser polarization was proposed .",
    "the linear polarization fraction is determined through finding the eigenvalues of the radiation transfer equations . in an important departure from previous studies , an ensemble average of the different modes of the radiation field , which is inherently broadband and random ,",
    "is considered .",
    "some novel solutions are found , namely that unsaturated maser emission can have the same polarization fraction as saturated masers and when the magnetic field is close to the maser axis ( @xmath11 ) , propagation of polarized emission is forbidden .",
    "in addition , the same analysis predicts that polarization properties of astronomical masers are spin independent , i.e high lying transitions should behave in the same way as the often studied j=10 transition .",
    "instability during the amplification of maser radiation is cited as the main reason for the new solutions , although in subsequent publications ( elitzur 1995 , 1996 ) , more emphasis is put on the ensemble average over modes or configurations of the radiation field .",
    "elitzur ( 1995 ) points out that a full understanding of the creation and evolution of polarization in masers requires simulations involving a statistical ensemble of waves .",
    "these new results are vehemently criticized by watson ( 1994 ) , who performs again the stability analysis on the radiation transfer equations and finds no instability .",
    "more recently , gray ( 2003 ) points that the multi - level model ( field & gray 1988 , gray & field 1995 ) can be formally reduced to the idealized two - level case with a similar set of equations as in watson ( 1994 ) , leading to the same predictions for the linear polarization properties of astronomical masers as obtained earlier by watson and co - workers .",
    "+ obviously , the explicit incorporation of the broadband random radiation field into the study of astronomical masers is of geat importance .",
    "that kind of simulation might help to elucidate the current debate regarding the polarization theory of astronomical masers . to simulate from first principles the amplification of radiation by a masing medium , as suggested by elitzur ( 1995 ) ,",
    "is a complicated task .",
    "in addition to a new formulation of the interaction process between radiation field and the maser medium , a dramatic increase in computing power to follow the evolution of a large number of realisations of the incident radiation field is also required .",
    "+ so far the only work aimed to treat the broadband maser radiation from first principles , and in a transparent and self - consistent manner , is published in menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) . however , due to limited computing power , they could not perform a large enough number of simulations to effectively draw any firm conclusion on the statistics of the maser radiation field . in a previous paper ( dinh - v - trung 2009 ) we have followed the formulation of menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) to investigate the standard theory of a scalar maser and the statistics of the maser radiation field . in this paper",
    "we generalize our model of the astronomical maser to include the vector nature of the radiation field . that will allow us perform simulations of polarized maser radiation , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "we hope that our work will provide a small step toward a better understanding of the properties of astronomical masers .",
    "in this paper we consider a one - dimensional maser and assume that a strong magnetic field exists inside the maser medium and makes an angle @xmath1 to the propagation direction of the radiation .",
    "that means the zeeman splitting @xmath12 between magnetic sub - levels of a particular rotational level j is much greater than the decay rates due to collisions and/or radiative transitions . as a result , the magnetic field defines a preferred direction in space and a good quantization axis .",
    "we adopt here the geometry used by deguchi & watson ( 1990 ) in which the magnetic field @xmath13 is aligned with the oz@xmath14 axis of the * b*-frame .",
    "the * k*-frame which has the oz axis directed along the propagation direction is obtained from the * b*-frame system by rotating through an angle @xmath1 about the ox@xmath14 axis .",
    "+ the spherical basis is defined in the conventional way ( brink & satchler 1994 , zare 1988 ) : @xmath15 where ( @xmath16 ) are the unit vectors along the frame axis .",
    "similarly the spherical bases in the * b*-frame is defined as : @xmath17 the relation between the two bases associated with the * k*-frame and the * b*-frame follows easily : @xmath18 we represent the electric field of the maser radiation and the induced macroscopic polarization vector in the spherical bases : @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "+ because our aim is to simulate the spectral properties of the maser radiation , it is preferable to work from the beginning in the frequency domain . in expressing the frequency dependence of the electric field and polarization vector ,",
    "we retain only the positive frequencies .",
    "the anti - resonant ( negative ) frequencies are ignored .",
    "this approximation is usually referred to as the rotating wave approximation .",
    "the spherical components of the electric field and polarization vector can be written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular frequency at the maser line center .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25 are assumed to vary slowly with time in comparison to the term @xmath26 . using the spectral representation theorem ( priestley 1981 ) , for any realisation of the radiation field during the time interval @xmath27 the amplitude of electric field and polarization vector can be expressed in terms of fourier series : @xmath28 where @xmath29 = @xmath30 .",
    "the stokes parameters of the radiation field are the quantities measured directly in observations of astronomical masers .",
    "these parameters are commonly used to characterize the polarization properties of the maser radiation .",
    "because the radiation field is stationary and ergodic , these parameters can be defined as either an ensemble average or time average of different realisations of the radiation field . for the convenience of presenting the simulation results",
    ", we will follow the same convention as in deguchi & watson ( 1990 ) in defining the four parameters @xmath31 for each frequency @xmath29 during an interval @xmath27 of each realisation : @xmath32   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the inclusion of @xmath35=@xmath36 is due to the fact that we use fourier series to decompose the radiation field into discrete harmonic components .",
    "each fourier component represents the radiation field in the frequency band of @xmath35 .",
    "the coherence time of the electric field ( mandel & wolf 1965 ) is indeed the interval @xmath27 .",
    "thus , during this interval of time , the radiation field within the frequency band @xmath35 can be considered as quasi - monochromatic .",
    "the four parameters @xmath31 , which are real and defined as above , are similar to stokes parameters of a monochromatic wave and statisfy the usual relation : @xmath37 we emphasize here that these parameters contain all the information on the amplitudes and the relative phase between different spherical components ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) of the radiation field in each frequency band .",
    "the usual stokes parameters of the random radiation field are then the ensemble averages , denoted as @xmath40 , of the above @xmath31 parameters : @xmath41 for unpolarized continuum radiation , the harmonic components of different polarization and frequency are independent random variables having zero mean and the same variance . therefore , after taking the ensemble average , the ensemble - averaged stokes parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish .",
    "we note that the information on the amplitude and relative phase of different spherical components of the radiation field at each frequency band is lost after the step of taking the ensemble average .",
    "that is the fundamental difference between the four parameters @xmath31 defined above for each realisation and the stokes parameters .",
    "the basic transfer equations of maser radiation are derived here for the case involving the transition j=10 . for higher transitions",
    "the procedure is similar but algebraic manipulation is considerably more involved . because we consider a one - dimensional maser amplifying the background continuum radiation , the spontaneous emission of masing molecules",
    "is ignored .",
    "this assumption is often used in theoretical studies of astronomical masers . to study self - consistently the effect of spontaneous emission , full quantum treatment of the radiation field",
    "is necessary and will be the subject of future publications .",
    "goldreich et al .",

    "however , the difference in phases between frequency modes of the radiation field is enough to randomize the stokes parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which characterize the linear polarization property of the background radiation field",
    ". therefore , in our simulations the amplitude of all frequency modes is a constant @xmath1271 on scale of @xmath128 .",
    "the intensity of the maser shown in all figures is also of the form @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the intensity per unit frequency @xmath131 as defined in the previous section .",

    "each realisation of the background radiation field is evolved through the maser by solving the equations * eqs .",
    "*  25 to determine the density matrix , together with integrating the equations * eq . *  29 to calculate the change of the amplitudes and phases of different spherical components ( @xmath39 and @xmath133 ) of the radiation field .",
    "we then record the emergent radiation for later analysis . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will present the results in the form of the parameters @xmath31 , as defined in sec.2.1 for each realisation of the background continuum radiation .",
    "these parameters have the advantage of containing the same information on the amplitudes and phases as the spherical components @xmath39 and @xmath133 , and at the same time are directly related to the usual stokes parameters through a simple ensemble average .",
    "+ we carry out our simulations in the partially saturated regime , which is likely relevant to most astronomical masers .",
    "the choice is also necessary because we consider only a limited number of harmonic components of the molecular population inversion . in the saturated regime",
    "the fluctuation will be stronger and thus require the consideration of a larger number of harmonic components .",
    "the amplification of the maser with length @xmath134 is specified by the unsaturated optical depth @xmath135 at the line center : @xmath136 a value of @xmath135 = 20 is used throughout in our simulations .",
    "the spontaneous transition rate between the upper and lower maser levels is taken to be 10@xmath137 s@xmath114 .",
    "the einstein coefficient @xmath100 is related to the spontaneous transition rate by the well - known relation @xmath138\\,b$ ] .",
    "our choice of unsaturated optical depth corresponds to a partially saturated maser . as such",
    ", the number of harmonic components of the density matrix used in our simulation is adequate to capture the pulsations induced by the radiation field .",
    "however , for higher optical depth , a larger number of harmonic components will be necessary .",
    "+ we consider two representative cases : in the first case the magnetic field @xmath13 makes an angle @xmath139 with respect to the maser axis and in the second case the magnetic field is perpendicular ( @xmath140 ) to the maser axis .",
    "the partially saturated masers in these two cases allow us to assess the validity of the standard formulation and also test the predictions of the model presented in elitzur ( 1992 , 1993 , 1996 ) . + in * fig .",
    "*  1 we show the parameters ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) of one realisation of the background continuum radiation for the case @xmath139 . because in our simulations the amplitude of both @xmath39 and @xmath38 of quasi - monochromatic modes are the same , the parameter @xmath144 is identical to zero .",
    "the intensity @xmath141 is also constant across the bandwidth of the incident radiation . only the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 of the radiation field fluctuate strongly due to the random phase of the electric field components @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , the ensemble average stokes parameters q and u are identically zero , as expected from a non - polarized background continuum radiation . the amplified radiation at the output of the maser as shown in * fig . *",
    "2 clearly displays the line narrowing effect and intensity fluctuations induced by the population pulsations .",
    "because the maser is only partially saturated , the harmonic components @xmath145 of the magnetic sub - level populations are small for @xmath146 as seen in * fig . *",
    "3 . in * fig .",
    "*  4 we show the ensemble averaged stokes parameters of the maser radiation calculated using 2400 realisations of the background continuum radiation field .",
    "these stokes parameters are consistent with the results of standard formulation for the same case as shown in * fig .",
    "similar results for the case @xmath140 are shown in * fig . *",
    "our simulation results show that the amplified radiation propagating close to the direction of the magnetic field ( @xmath139 ) possesses both linear and circular polarization .",
    "the appearance of circular polarization is a natural consequence of taking into account the zeeman splitting , which in our case is not negligible in comparison to the maser linewidth . since the stimulated emission rate is quite small even at the line centre ( @xmath1470.05 , @xmath1480.1 ) , the fractional linear polarization q / i is small @xmath1491% at the line center , well below the limit of 100% predicted by goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) for fully saturated masers . within the partial saturation regime , which is probably most relevant to astronomical masers ,",
    "our results are consistent with the results obtained from standard formulation ( * eqs .",
    "*  30 and * eqs . *  33 ) and with the calculations of western & watson ( 1984 ) , which indicate that linear polarization approaches the 100% limit very slowly for @xmath150 . the fractional linear polarization of the maser polarization grows faster in the case @xmath140 and reaches q / i @xmath91.5% at the line center ( * figs . *  6 & 7 ) .",
    "this result is also consistent with that predicted by western & watson ( 1984 ) .",
    "we note that by reducing the multi - level model to the idealized two - level case , gray ( 2003 ) also reached similar conclusions .",
    "thus our results agree with previous analytical and numerical simulation works done by gray ( 2003 ) and by western & watson ( 1984 ) .",
    "+ the creation of linear polarization when the magnetic field is close to the maser axis ( @xmath151 or @xmath152 ) contradicts the model of maser polarization described in elitzur ( 1993 , 1996 ) , which predicts that propagation of polarized radiation is inhibited in the directions close to the magnetic field * b*. no instability associated with the evolution of fully polarized modes of maser radiation is seen during the integration of the radiation transfer equations * eqs . *  25 and * eqs . *  29 .",
    "such instability is identified in elitzur ( 1993 ) as the main reason for maser radiation to be linearly polarized at the polarization limit q / i = ( 3@xmath5)/3@xmath6 for @xmath7 even when the maser is unsaturated .",
    "contrary to this assertion , our simulation for the case of a partially saturated maser with @xmath140 shows that the fractional linear polarization of the maser radiation is actually small , @xmath91.5% , well below the limit of 33% given by the above expression .",
    "+ we note that in elitzur ( 1993 , 1996 ) the equations normally reserved for stokes parameters and steady - state populations , quantities obtained by ensemble averaging over large number of realisations of radiation fields , are used to describe the evolution of quasi - monochromatic and fully polarized modes of the radiation field .",
    "consequently , it leads to some difficulty in understanding the requirement given in elitzur ( 1993 , 1996 ) to perform another averaging step to justify the mathematical solutions of the eigenvalue problem for the standard radiation transfer equations .",
    "the confusing description of the way to handle the random radiation field ( elitzur 1991 , 1993 ) seems to indicate that a self - consistent treatment of the interaction between radiation and masing medium has not been achieved .",
    "the explicit incorporation of broadband random radiation field into our treatment of the astronomical maser has proved very important to investigate the properties of maser emission .",
    "we are able to directly simulate the amplification of the background continuum radiation by the maser and study in detail the appearance of linear polarization .",
    "our simulation results show that there is no problem with previous numerical studies of the maser polarization in the unsaturated and partially saturated regime .",
    "hopefully , the current formulation can be extended and applied to study maser emission under conditions other than that considered here .",
