    "the radio - loud source pks 2004 - 447 , @xmath1 , was identified as a candidate narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) from low resolution optical spectra of a subsample of quasars identified in the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample @xcite(hereafter phfs ) .",
    "the phfs is designed to efficiently select radio - loud agn by looking for flat or inverted radio spectra over the range of 2.7 and 5.0 ghz .",
    "it contains 323 radio bright ( @xmath2jy at 2.7 ghz ) , generally compact radio sources .",
    "higher resolution spectroscopy of this object was obtained giving more accurate velocity widths of the emission lines indicating this may be an nls1 but more accurate spectroscopy is still needed to be able to clearly separate the broad and narrow components of h@xmath3 . in any case this object has very interesting implications to the study of agn .",
    "nls1s are generally considered to be an extreme but common subclass of agn .",
    "they are defined by their optical emission line properties , such that the h@xmath3 line is both strong ( with a flux ratio [ ] /h@xmath4 , similar to seyfert 1 galaxies ) and narrow ( the h@xmath5 km s@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "these properties are correlated with strong emission and a strong soft x - ray excess , amongst other properties , for most objects in the subclass .",
    "nls1s do not appear to form a distinct class but are instead connected to the `` standard '' broad - line seyfert population through a continuum of properties .",
    "@xcite have shown that nls1s cluster at one end of the region defined by the first principal component described in their study of the optical spectra of 87 low - redshift bqs quasars .",
    "the first principal component is thought to describe the major physical property in quasar structure that is responsible for spectral differences between agn , independent of orientation .",
    "@xcite suggest that the physical parameter driving this eigenvector is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rate of mass accretion onto the central massive object .",
    "nls1s are thought to be accreting at a rate closer to the eddington limit ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "nls1s are generally radio - quiet objects , with only three previously identified radio - loud objects , pks 0558 - 504 @xcite , rgb j0044 + 193 @xcite and j0134.2 - 4258 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that radio - loud qsos and the nls1s ( with a strong , soft x - ray excess ) lie at opposite ends of the primary eigenvector .",
    "although the criteria for nls1s are well defined , it is unclear whether these phenomenological attributes reflect a single underlying physical mechanism .",
    "thus the discovery of a very radio - loud nls1 may indicate that the observational definition of nls1s requires refinement .",
    "alternatively , radio - loud nls1s may provide a more stringent test of the models of nls1s .",
    "three important consequences of the identification of a radio - loud nls1 will be considered .",
    "firstly , are the radio - loud nls1s the same class of objects as most others in the class .",
    "secondly , are radio - loud nls1s consistent with any of the popular models for nls1s and thirdly , do radio - loud quasars require large mass black holes .",
    "this object challenges that assertion as is further discussed in section  4    in section 2 , we present the observational data on pks 2004 - 477 . in section 3 , this object is compared to the three other radio - loud nls1s which have been identified .",
    "the central black hole mass is determined using standard techniques in section 4 , and possible models for nls1s are discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 was first identified as a nls1 candidate from a low resolution spectrum obtained using the rgo / fors spectrograph at the aat in 1984 and published in @xcite .",
    "a higher resolution confirmation spectrum was taken using the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the anu 2.3 m telescope , 1st august 2000 , and is shown in fig  1 .",
    "the conditions were not photometric .",
    "the spectrum was reduced using standard procedures in the iraf .",
    "the spectrum has a resolution of@xmath10 .",
    "typically , in nls1s , emission contaminates the spectrum making accurate measurements of h@xmath3 and [ ] difficult . in order to account for this and to get an estimate on the strength of the emission in this object we employed the subtraction method introduced by @xcite and now commonly used .",
    "we use a template spectrum taken from the prototype strong fe emitter i zw 1 and scale it and shift it until the width and intensity match those seen in our object .",
    "we did this over the region 5050 - 5500   using a @xmath11-minimisation to get the best value for the scaling .",
    "we find that this spectral region contains very little emission with an equivalent width ew@xmath12  for the whole complex in the region 5050 - 5450  .",
    "compared to values measured in @xcite , this is extremely low ( although we are fitting a slightly different region of the spectrum ) .",
    "we measured the line widths and fluxes using lorentzian fits to the emission lines and the results are summarised in table 1 .",
    "the width of @xmath13 km s@xmath6and the flux ratio [ ] /h@xmath14 , fit the criteria for classification as a nls1 .",
    "the dbs spectrum does not extend to wavelengths of the ( @xmath154570 ) lines .",
    "however the previous low resolution spectrum indicates emission in the region 4435 - 4700  , blueward of the @xmath16 line ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the low resolution spectrum also shows strong h@xmath17 and evidence for h@xmath18 emission and it also indicates that the stregth of the h@xmath3 emission , relative to [ ] has varied between the two epochs .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 is also optically variable .",
    "the magnitude of this object measured from the cosmos / ukst southern sky catalogue is @xmath19 , while more recent photometry obtained on the anu 2.3 m telescope gave @xmath20 @xcite , indicating a drop in flux by a factor of @xmath21 over an interval of several years .",
    "simultaneous optical / ir photometry are shown in fig  3 .",
    "the continuum is very red and there is no evidence of a big blue bump .",
    "the absolute magnitude is between -19.0 and -21.2 , for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , clearly placing this in the seyfert luminosity class .",
    "( 5007 ) + fwhm(km s@xmath6 ) & 1447 & 951 & 754 + flux relative to h@xmath3 & 1.0&0.61 & 1.61 + ew (  ) & 31.6&19.6 & 50.6 + offset ( km s@xmath6 ) & @xmath24&@xmath25&0 +      under the selection criteria , the phfs objects are detected above 0.5 jy at 2.7ghz and with a spectral slope @xmath26 ( f@xmath27 ) taken from non - simultaneous observations at 2.7ghz and 5.0 ghz . using this method pks 2004 - 447 had a 2.7 ghz flux of 0.81 jy and a spectral index @xmath28 .",
    "subsequent simultaneous observations of this source were taken using the atca ( 23rd november 1995 ) and the radio flux had varied since the parkes observations , demonstrating long term variability at these frequencies as well .",
    "the radio spectrum is shown in fig  3 . a powerlaw fit to the simultaneous data gives a spectral index @xmath29 ; thus pks 2004 - 447 is actually a steep spectrum source . calculating @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the ratio of radio to optical flux ( @xmath31 ) , @xcite , gives values in the range @xmath32 depending on value used for the optical magnitude . obviously , this source is very radio - loud .",
    "the radio image is unresolved in the atca observations .",
    "the visibility of pks 2004 - 477 was measured using the parkes - tidbinbilla interferometer on a 275 km baseline at 2.3 ghz @xcite .",
    "the average of two measurements gave a visibility of 0.680 corresponding to an angular size of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "since this source size is derived from a 2-element interferometer , it is measured along one baseline .",
    "there are two previous studies of the radio properties of nls1s .",
    "the most recent and well defined is that of @xcite , who obtained high resolution observations of 24 nls1s at 20 cm and 3.6 cm using the vla .",
    "all but one of the sources were detected , with 20 cm fluxes up to @xmath35 , which is higher , on average , than classical seyferts .",
    "moran found most nls1s unresolved at @xmath36 , with generally quite steep ( @xmath37 ) radio spectra , though the spectral index of pks 2004 - 477 is consistent with the flattest values .",
    "in other words these could be considered as low luminosity compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources .",
    "there is also a few cases of variability at 20 cm , again , as seen in pks 2004 - 477 .",
    "thus pks 2004 - 477 is compact , steep - spectrum and variable in the radio , which are similar properties to other nls1s @xcite .",
    "this is further discussed in section 5 .",
    "nls1s have unusual x - ray properties .",
    "they generally display a large soft x - ray excess , a steep hard x - ray spectrum and large amplitude x - ray variability over short and long timescales .",
    "@xcite investigated the x - ray properties of the phfs using the rosat all sky survey .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 was detected with a total flux in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev range of @xmath38 erg @xmath39 s@xmath6 corresponding to @xmath40erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we find an optical  to  x - ray slope of @xmath41 .",
    "this is consistent with values found by @xcite for a rosat selected sample of nls1s .",
    "most nls1s are radio - quiet and only three radio - loud nls1s are known @xcite .",
    "pks 0558 - 504 was optically identified on the basis of x - ray positions from the high energy astronomical observatory @xcite .",
    "it was noted as not only having very narrow hydrogen emission lines , but also strong emission .",
    "it has a radio flux of 113 mjy at 4.85 ghz , an optical magnitude @xmath42 and a redshift @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this source exhibits strong x - ray variability on medium ( months ) and short ( days , hours ) time scales @xcite and an x - ray flare indicating relativistic beaming @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified rgb j0044 + 193 as a radio - loud nls1 .",
    "rgb j0044 + 193 has only a moderate radio flux , but is calculated to have a radio - to - optical flux ratio @xmath45 .",
    "it was identified as a radio - loud x - ray source with a redshift of @xmath46 in a cross - correlation of the rosat all - sky survey and the green bank 5ghz radio survey @xcite .",
    "it has the bluest optical spectrum of any nls1 observed to date .",
    "@xcite measure an optical continuum slope of @xmath47 redward of 5000   and a slope of @xmath48 blueward of 5000 where @xmath49 .",
    "this source was detected in the 87 gb survey with @xmath50 mjy .",
    "a high resolution follow - up using the vla at 4.85 ghz gave a flux of only 7 mjy @xcite , indicating that this source is extended or variable .",
    "the latter is supported by the fact that the radio source is unresolved on the vla map and it is not detected at 1.4 ghz in the nrao / vla sky survey , which is sensitive down to 2.5 mjy .",
    "this suggests that the classification of the source as radio - loud is uncertain . in all other respects ,",
    "rgb j0044 + 193 is indistinguishable from radio - quiet nls1s .",
    "rx j0134.2 - 4258 was discovered by @xcite to have the steepest soft x - ray spectrum observed during the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "it has an optical magnitude of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it was detected in the pmn survey @xcite with a flux of 0.055 jy at 4.85 ghz , and was subsequently re - observed at the vla to have a flux of 0.025 jy at 8.4 ghz .",
    "this gives a ratio of @xmath53 , and a radio spectral index of @xmath54 for non - simultaneous observations .",
    "the source is highly variable in the x - ray , and there is evidence for variability at other wavelengths .",
    "the emission is strong , unlike that of pks 2004 - 477 .",
    "there seems to be a growing consensus that a more massive black hole is needed to produce a radio - loud quasar @xcite .",
    "pks  2004 - 447 appears to directly conflict with this statement .",
    "calculations of the black hole mass rely on the assumption that the dynamics of the blr gas are dominated by the central black hole . to calculate the black hole mass for this object we use the results of @xcite , which are derived from a reverberation study of 17 quasars . @xcite",
    "empirically determine linear relationship between @xmath55 and the luminosity ( @xmath56 ) which we use to estimate the radius of the blr - emitting gas . from equation  5 in @xcite .",
    "@xmath57^{0.700 } \\text{lt - days}\\ ] ] we use the luminosity taken from a linear interpolation between photometric data points @xcite at the rest wavelength of 5100 .",
    "following @xcite , the mass of the black hole is given by @xmath58 . to determine @xmath59 , the velocity , we correct @xmath60 of the h@xmath3 emission line by a factor of @xmath61 to account for velocities in three dimensions .",
    "the mass is then @xmath62 using the cosmology @xmath22 and @xmath63 km s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , this gives us a value for the central black hole mass of @xmath64 .",
    "this mass is two orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by other authors for radio - loud quasars . in a study of the black hole masses of quasars from the @xcite sample",
    ", it was found that all quasars with @xmath65 are radio - quiet @xcite .",
    "the data from this sample is shown in fig  4 , with the mass of pks  2004 - 447 added .",
    "it can be seen that pks  2004 - 447 is quite different than the rest of the sample .",
    "we note that @xcite assumes a flatter relationship than @xcite , but estimates that this difference results in a discrepancy of @xmath66 in the mass estimates .",
    "this corresponds to a shift of @xmath67 in log@xmath68 , which does not qualitatively affect the result in figure  4 .",
    "similarly @xcite , in their study of radio - loud and radio - quiet objects , came to the conclusion that a radio - loud quasar requires a mass @xmath69 .",
    "this again , is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the mass we derive for pks  2004 - 447 .",
    "we speculate that the reason our object has a black hole mass so much smaller than those seen in previous studies is not entirely due to it being an unusual object , but more likely due to the selection criteria in the previous samples .",
    "all previous studies have used optical selection to compile their sample .",
    "this selection technique preferentially selects radio - loud quasars which are blue with very broad emission lines .",
    "however samples of radio - selected quasars such as the phfs show that the general radio - loud population can be quite different @xcite . in these samples",
    "it may be quite common to have low mass black holes producing large radio - jets and this issue will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "since the subclass of nls1s are defined by phenomenological measurements , rather than a specific physical model , it is possible that more than one physical mechanism will produce the defining parameters .",
    "first we should consider whether pks  2004 - 447 should be defined as an nls1 .",
    "certainly it meets the formal definition of @xcite . in the x - ray ,",
    "the flux ratios are consistent with other nls1s , but pointed observations are required to obtain spectral information . in the optical , the emission is much weaker than other nls1s .",
    "apart from the obvious strength of the radio flux , the size of the radio source , and its spectral index are consistent with other radio measurements @xcite .    the object s radio properties fit with the definition of a compact steep spectrum radio source ( css ) according to the definition from @xcite of : @xmath70w hz@xmath6 ; a size smaller or comparable to the optical galaxy scale ; and the spectral index @xmath71 .",
    "the css sources tend to have spectra with narrow emission lines typical of radio - galaxies .",
    "the broad component of h@xmath3 seems to be extremely weak or absent @xcite .",
    "@xcite find an average value [ ] /h@xmath72 indicating that the h@xmath3 flux is too weak to be an nls1 . in the study of @xcite",
    "all css sources with measurable h@xmath3 are of quasar luminosity .",
    "so pks 2004 - 447 is unusual in both categories : firstly it has an optical spectrum which is unusual for css source ; and secondly has radio power unusual for nls1s .",
    "the source is clearly in the seyfert luminosity range , as are a significant fraction of the sources in phfs .",
    "the differences in optical spectral properties , ( such as the weakness of the emission ) between pks 2004 - 477 and nls1s in general raise the possibility that the nls1-defining characteristics of this source are due to a different physical mechanism from other objects in the subclass .",
    "this possibility may be resolved when an x - ray spectrum is obtained .",
    "finding unusual objects in a particular class is a useful method for distinguishing between different possible physical models .",
    "although there have been a variety of physical models suggested for nls1s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see for a summary ) it seems that the model with the strongest observational support is the high accretion rate , low black hole mass model .",
    "this model suggests that nls1s are objects where the black hole is accreting at a rate closer to the eddington limit compared to broad - line seyferts .",
    "since there is a higher rate of accretion , a given luminosity corresponds to a black hole with a smaller mass .",
    "if the size of the blr is determined by the bolometric luminosity , then , at a given radius , the broad line clouds will have slower velocities and the emission lines will be narrower .",
    "this model was developed to explain the soft x - ray excess and the steep x - ray powerlaw , by analogy with the x - ray spectra of galactic black hole candidates accreting in their `` high''state @xcite . for high accretion rates ,",
    "the soft thermal emission from the disk becomes energetically dominant , producing the soft x - ray excess , and the x - ray powerlaw spectrum can be steepened as a result of compton cooling of the electrons by the soft x - ray photons .",
    "an alternative model for the narrow hydrogen lines suggests we are viewing the source near the axis of the accretion disk .",
    "if the velocity width of the hydrogen emission lines is dominated by the rotation of the accretion disk , then they will appear narrow .",
    "the radio emission in pks is moderately steep spectrum , which weakens the argument that we observe this source near the axis .",
    "indeed it also weakens arguments which suggest that the radio emission is strongly boosted by beaming .",
    "however the radio source is very compact , with no evidence at any frequency for double - lobed emission .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 , detected in the phfs , is an unusual source . to summarize the major points regarding pks  2004 - 447 :    1 .",
    "it has h@xmath3 width and strength consistent with being classified as an nls1 as defined by @xcite .",
    "2 .   its radio properties are very unusual for a seyfert galaxy having the following characteristics : very strong radio flux , 0.81 jy at 2.7 ghz ; very radio - loud , @xmath73 ; steep radio spectral index @xmath74 ; compact radio source ; some evidence of long term variability .",
    "these properties are consistent with it being classified as a compact steep spectrum source .",
    "it has been detected in the rass with a flux @xmath75 erg  @xmath39  s@xmath6 but no spectral information is available .",
    "4 .   following the procedure set out by @xcite",
    ", we calculate the black hole mass to be @xmath76 .",
    "this mass is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than those seen previously for radio - loud agn and challenges previous results that a large black hole mass is needed to produce radio - loud agn .",
    "additional observations of the x - ray spectrum will further constrain models and may provide evidence that the black hole is accreting at a rate closer to the eddington limit .",
    "this would be an indication that the underlying physical mechanism in this object is similar to those in other nls1s , and that the radio power of the object is actually connected to a different parameter .",
