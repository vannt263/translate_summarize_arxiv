    "in recent papers @xcite we have studied heavy tetraquark candidates combining lattice qcd and quark model techniques proceeding in two steps .",
    "first we have computed potentials of two static antiquarks @xmath0 in the presence of two quarks of finite mass @xmath1 ( @xmath2 throughout this work ) using lattice qcd @xcite ( such potentials have also been computed by other groups , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the static approximation is expected to be a rather good approximation for @xmath3 and allows for a comparably easy computation of the potentials . for larger @xmath0 separations",
    "some of these potentials can be interpreted as potentials of two @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 mesons , which are degenerate in the static limit . in a second step",
    "we have inserted these potentials into the schrdinger equation for the relative coordinate of the two @xmath6 mesons .",
    "we have then checked , whether they are sufficiently attractive to host bound states , which would indicate stable @xmath7 tetraquarks . for a specific potential ( isospin @xmath8 , light quark spin @xmath9 )",
    "we have found a bound state with confidence level @xmath10 and binding energy @xmath11 , while there seems to be no bound state in any of the other channels @xcite .    in the static limit effects due to the spin of @xmath12 quarks",
    "are neglected , e.g.  there is no mass difference of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for infinitely heavy @xmath12 quarks . these effects , however , could be of the same order as the @xmath11 binding energy of the tetraquark predicted in @xcite , as can e.g.  be estimated from the mass difference @xmath13 .",
    "the goal of this work is to take the heavy @xmath12 spins into account , in particular to estimate their effect on the binding energy of the above mentioned @xmath14 @xmath7 tetraquark .",
    "due to static quark symmetries it is essential to couple the light spin indices and the static spin indices separately , when defining @xmath16 potential creation operators . to interpret the meson - meson structure generated by such operators",
    ", one needs to express them in terms of static - light bilinears .",
    "we do this by using the fierz identity @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote spin indices , + @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the inverse of @xmath22 .",
    "the left hand side of this equation has the structure of a @xmath16 potential creation operator ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) , while the right - hand side allows to read off , which linear combination of @xmath4 meson pairs it excites .    in the following we are interested in those matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 generating @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 mesons ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) . after some linear algebra one finds that there are 16 such combinations , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes the charge conjugation matrix ) .",
    "the @xmath16 potentials , which have been computed in the static limit , depend only on the light spin coupling @xmath23 , but not on the heavy spin coupling @xmath24 .",
    "there are two different potentials , ( 1 )  @xmath29 ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) , attractive for isospin @xmath8 , repulsive for isospin @xmath31 , and ( 2 )  @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) , repulsive for isospin @xmath8 , attractive for isospin @xmath31 , where @xmath34 .",
    "note that it is not possible to choose @xmath24 and @xmath23 in a way that exclusively @xmath4 mesons appear on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fierz_identity ] ) .",
    "one always finds linear combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , e.g.  for @xmath35 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fierz_identity ] ) is proportional to @xmath36 ( the indices @xmath37 denote the spin orientation of @xmath5 ) .",
    "taking this mixing of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons into account , which differ in mass by @xmath38 , is the goal of this work , as already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we study a coupled channel schrdinger equation @xmath39 where the hamiltonian @xmath40 acts on a 16-component wave function @xmath41 .",
    "the components of @xmath41 correspond to the 16 possibilities to combine + @xmath42 and @xmath43 , i.e.  the first component corresponds to @xmath44 , the second to @xmath45 , etc .",
    "the hamiltonian can be split in a free and an interacting part , @xmath46 .",
    "the free part is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "the interacting part can be written according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a @xmath52 matrix relating the 16 choices for @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec001 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fierz_identity ] ) ) to the 16 components of @xmath41 ( the entries of @xmath51 can be computed using the fierz identity ( [ eq : fierz_identity ] ) ) .",
    "rotational symmetry allows to bring the coupled channel schrdinger equation ( [ eqn001 ] ) to block diagonal form , i.e.  to split it into independent simpler equations corresponding to definite total spin @xmath54 and isospin @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related , because quarks are fermions and have to obey the pauli principle ( cf .",

    "one can show that the radial wave function of an @xmath74 wave bound state is subject to the boundary conditions @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "first exploratory numerical tests have been performed with @xmath8 potentials , i.e.  with an attractive @xmath77 and a weakly repulsive @xmath78 channel is excluded by the pauli principle , it is conceptually interesting to compare numerical results with existing results from @xcite , where heavy spin effects have not been taken into account . ] .",

    "[ fig : plot ] we show results obtained with an unphysically strong attractive potential @xmath77 ( roughly a factor @xmath85 stronger than the lattice qcd result for @xmath77 ) .",
    "the intersection of the red line and the green line at @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath84 , i.e.  represents an energy eigenstate . since @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the upper boundary of the plot ) , this eigenstate is a bound four quark state .",

    "is needed , to confirm or rule out a bound state . in any case",
    ", one can conclude that the heavy @xmath15 spins counteract four - quark binding .",
    "most interesting will , of course , be an investigation of the physical channels listed at the beginning of section  [ sec003 ] , in particular the @xmath93 channel , which has a stronger attractive potential than the @xmath59 channels .",
