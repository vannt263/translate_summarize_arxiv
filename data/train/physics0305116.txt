    "with the maturing of the quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) technique , in particular by electric - field poling of ferro - electric materials , such as linbo@xmath0 @xcite , by poling of polymers @xcite and quantum - well disordering in semiconductors @xcite , the number of applications of quadratic nonlinear ( or @xmath1 ) materials has increased significantly .",
    "even complicated qpm grating structures are now commercially available in periodically poled linbo@xmath0 ( ppln ) .",
    "it is therefore more important than ever to have complete knowledge of the effects a qpm grating has on the properties of @xmath1 materials .",
    "the most fundamental effect of a qpm grating , with a certain spectrum of spatial wave vectors , is to allow noncritical phase matching at all wavelengths for which the wave - vector mismatch @xmath2 matches a component of the grating spectrum .",
    "thus qpm gratings allow for efficient multiple wavelength second harmonic generation ( shg ) @xcite , which may , for example , be used for multiple - channel wavelength conversion @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing phase matching , qpm gratings have the basic effect that they induce an asymmetric cubic nonlinearity ( acn ) in the equations for the average field in the form of self- and cross - phase modulation terms @xcite .",
    "this acn appears in linear and/or nonlinear periodic qpm gratings of arbitrary shape @xcite , it can be focusing or defocusing , depending on the sign of the phase mismatch @xcite , and its strength can be increased ( e.g. , dominating the kerr nonlinearity ) by modulation of the grating @xcite . in continuous - wave operation",
    "the acn induces an intensity - dependent phase mismatch , just as the inherent kerr nonlinearity , with potential use in switching applications @xcite . the acn further explains a wide spectrum of novel fundamental properties of solitons @xcite and modulational instability ( mi ) @xcite .",
    "importantly the acn is a general effect of non - phase - matched wave interaction and as such appear also in homogeneous @xmath1 materials in the cascading limit .",
    "in fact , in this case the asymmetric signature of the acn may be measured as the difference between the properties in upconversion and downconversion , since there is no effective @xmath1 nonlinearity competing with the acn as in qpm gratings .",
    "such an experiment was recently reported @xcite and thus the acn has now been confirmed both numerically and experimentally .    in this paper , we present the results of a complete study into the modulational instability of beams in 1 + 1d qpm waveguides .",
    "we find that in general , the mi gain spectrum has a multipeaked structure of up to three fundamental bands with accompanying overtones .",
    "our previous work@xcite concentrated on the structure of the fundamental ( long - wave instability ) bands at low transverse wavenumbers .",
    "these bands are due to mi of the averaged field , and are predicted by averaged equations , provided the effective acns are taken into account for the most accurate description .",
    "for example , for qpm with a simultaneous linear and nonlinear grating and/or with a nonlinear grating with a dc - value ( as with qpm in polymers @xcite and semiconductors @xcite ) , the acns can suppress these fundamental bands , making plane waves modulationally stable over hundreds of diffraction lengths @xcite .",
    "exact floquet calculations and numerical simulations confirmed the predictions for the low - frequency bands , but also revealed high - frequency bands not predicted by the averaged theory .",
    "these gain bands were surmised to be related to the inherent instability in homogeneous ( non - phase - matched ) @xmath1 media @xcite .",
    "however , an accurate _ analytic _ description of the first overtone bands was not derived and the higher overtone bands were not discussed at all .",
    "here we concentrate on ppln slab waveguides , which are @xmath1 media with a purely nonlinear qpm grating with no dc - component .",
    "although more - general kinds of grating can be analysed with our method , we choose to focus on the simpler case for clarity .",
    "for example , with this simple qpm grating we do not need to take into account the acn for an accurate description of mi @xcite , however our analytic method does allow for such cubic nonlinearities to be included .",
    "we present the first analytical and numerical description of the complete mi spectrum with all overtones .",
    "we show explicitly that the overtone series are caused by mi in the rapidly varying components of the propagating fields , which are in turn induced by the grating .",
    "we derive approximate analytic expressions for the positions of the gain bands and compare them with exact floquet results and direct numerical simulation , to find good agreement .",
    "we consider a linearly polarized electric field propagating in a lossless @xmath1 slab waveguide with a qpm grating under conditions for ( the most efficient ) first - order qpm and type i shg .",
    "the normalized dynamical equations for the slowly varying envelopes of the fundamental @xmath3 and second harmonic ( sh ) @xmath4 take the form    @xmath5    where the asterisk means complex conjugate .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 scales have been normalised by @xmath8 and @xmath9=@xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11=@xmath12 is the normalized wave - vector mismatch .",
    "the nonlinearity is periodic in @xmath7 with expansion    @xmath13    where @xmath14=@xmath15 ( @xmath16 is real ) and the grating wave number @xmath17 is defined to be positive .",
    "the grating will force the same periodicity in the propagating fields .",
    "we therefore expand these also :    @xmath18    where @xmath19=@xmath20 is the residual mismatch , with @xmath21=@xmath22 for first - order qpm . substituting all expansions into eqs .",
    "( [ field_eqns1]-[field_eqns2 ] ) gives    @xmath23    where @xmath24 .",
    "this set of equations has plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite .    to study mi",
    "we consider small perturbations of the plane - wave solutions :    @xmath27\\exp{(i\\lambda z ) } , \\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\   v_n(x , z)&=&\\left[\\bar v_n + \\mu_n(x , z)\\right]\\exp{(i2\\lambda z)}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substitution into eqs .",
    "( [ coupled1]-[coupled2 ] ) gives the linearized equations    @xmath28    where @xmath29 .",
    "writing the perturbations in the form    @xmath30    one obtains a linear matrix equation for the perturbation @xmath31=@xmath32 , which couples all fourier components .    to derive a simple result we consider nearly phase - matched interaction with @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35@xmath361 in the typical ( for ppln ) square qpm grating , for which @xmath14=0 for @xmath37 even and @xmath14=@xmath38 for @xmath37 odd .",
    "the requirement @xmath39 allows us to assume that the amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 vary slowly compared to @xmath42 and that the higher harmonics are much smaller than the dc - fields , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the structure of the matrix equation means that the evolution of the perturbation in each component is to a good approximation decoupled from the other components ,    @xmath46\\vec{\\delta}_n \\equiv m_n \\vec{\\delta}_n ,    \\label{mi_matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47=@xmath48 , @xmath49=@xmath50 , @xmath51=@xmath52 , and @xmath53=@xmath54 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath55 are    @xmath56    where    @xmath57    any positive real part of an eigenvalue corresponds to mi with the gain @xmath58 .",
    "for the gratings that we consider here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "analysing the gain versus @xmath47 and @xmath53 reveals three gain bands , with extrema remaining close to @xmath61 ( diagonal branch db ) and @xmath62 ( hyperbolic branches hb@xmath63 , hb@xmath64 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ branches ] for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the extrema @xmath61 of db correspond to    @xmath67    while the extrema @xmath62 of hb@xmath63 and hb@xmath64 correspond to    @xmath68    for @xmath69 the hb@xmath63 bands appear at @xmath70 and the hb@xmath64 bands at @xmath71 .",
    "thus we have the structure of up to 3 gain bands in the average field ( @xmath37=0 ) , each with a set of equally spaced ( in @xmath72 ) weak overtone gain bands ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , the gain is large only near @xmath47=0 ( see fig .  [ branches ] ) . for @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 can be satisfied without violating the assumptions only on hb@xmath64 , and thus the overtones of the other branches will be small .",
    "consider a system at exact phase - matching @xmath76 , with dimensionless parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for a linbo@xmath0 qpm grating with period @xmath79 designed to phase - match at wavelengths of around @xmath80 nm , these dimensionless parameters correspond to having an input intensity of @xmath81gw@xmath82m@xmath83 , if one assumes a waveguide depth of @xmath84 m .",
    "the distance scaling parameters for this case are @xmath85 m and @xmath86 mm . for fixed distance",
    "scaling , different values of the magnitude of @xmath87 correspond to different input intensities , and different signs of @xmath87 correspond to different ratios of the fundamental to second harmonic@xcite . on the other hand , keeping @xmath88 fixed while varying the input intensity corresponds to changing the distance scaling : to a good approximation , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and hence @xmath91 .    for @xmath87=1",
    "our analytic results predict only one fundamental @xmath37=0 gain band ( hb@xmath63 ) and three gain bands in all overtones .",
    "however the overtones of db and hb@xmath63 are too small to be seen .",
    "thus the visible gain bands have maxima at @xmath92=1.18 ( hb@xmath63 ) , @xmath93=36.64 , @xmath94=51.84 , etc .",
    "( all hb@xmath64 ) .",
    "in physical units these are @xmath95m@xmath96 , @xmath97m@xmath96 , and @xmath98m@xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the analytical results agree with exact floquet calculations @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "[ gtheory ] .    for @xmath87=@xmath99 two fundamental @xmath37=0 bands are predicted ( db and hb@xmath63 ) , with one set of visible overtones from hb@xmath64 .",
    "the maxima are at @xmath92=2 ( db ) , @xmath92=3.38 ( hb@xmath63 ) , @xmath93=36.70 , @xmath94=51.88 , etc .",
    "( all hb@xmath64 ) .",
    "in physical units these are @xmath100m@xmath96 , @xmath101m@xmath96 , @xmath102m@xmath96 , and @xmath103m@xmath96 , respectively .",
    "this is again confirmed by the exact floquet calculations seen in fig .",
    "[ gtheory ] .",
    "figure [ gtheory ] also shows the gain profiles predicted by eq .",
    "( [ evalues ] ) , which agree well with the exact floquet results .",
    "direct numerical simulation @xcite of eqs .",
    "( [ field_eqns1]-[field_eqns2 ] ) with mi seeded by noise also confirmed our results ( see fig .",
    "[ gnumerical ] ) .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ nudia]-[nuhyp ] ) that the dimensionless spectral positions of the higher - order bands depends on @xmath17 , whereas the fundamental bands do not .",
    "the different dependence implies a different scaling with input intensity , since for fixed @xmath88 , both the distance scalings @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the dimensionless wave vector @xmath17 depend on the intensity .",
    "the result is that the spatial frequencies of the higher - harmonic instabilities remain the same , in physical units , whereas the frequencies of the fundamental - band instabilities generally increase with the quartic root of the intensity .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple theory able to accurately predict the complete mi spectrum in general qpm gratings in @xmath1 materials . in particular ,",
    "we have predicted and verified that overtone gain bands originate from mi in the higher - order fourier components of the field .",
