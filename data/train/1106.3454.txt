    "recent advances on nanomagnetism technology allow to fabricate stoner particles ( single - domain magnetic nanoparticles due to strong exchange interaction)@xcite , which has attracted much attention both from a fundamental point of view and potential applications in information industry@xcite .",
    "magnetization dynamics of a single stoner particle has been extensively studied , either by static or time - dependent magnetic fields @xcite , or by spin - polarized current approaches@xcite .",
    "the current - induced magnetization switching attracts much interest due to the locality and convenient controllability of currents .",
    "however , the high critical switching current @xmath0 ( or density ) hinders practical applications@xcite .",

    "recently lower @xmath0 has also been proposed in ferromagnetic semiconductors@xcite .    moreover , since magnetic nanoparticles are actually fabricated in arrays@xcite , the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) between them will be important for the magnetic switching behavior .",
    "indeed there were several theoretical studies on systems of two stoner particles , the simplest case to investigate the ddi effect , concluding the dipolar interaction can assist the magnetic switching@xcite . recently a collaboration including the present authors revisited the two - body stoner particles problem and proposed a novel technological perspective by showing that , in a synchronized dynamics mode ( i.e. both the magnetic vectors of the particles runs synchronously )",
    ", the critical switching field in presence of magnetic ddi can be dramatically lowered .",
    "this implies even zero - field switching to be achieved by appropriately engineering the ddi strength by adjusting the interparticle distance@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we extend these studies by investigating current - induced synchronized magnetization switching of such the two - body stoner particles system on injecting a spin - polarized current through a spin - valve - like structure . as a result , the critical switching current @xmath0 ( or its density )",
    "can be lowered to about @xmath1 of the usual value without ddi around a critical ddi strength .",
    "this ddi strength corresponds to a distinguished interparticle distance and has the same value as in the previously studied case of field - induced switching@xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 bifurcates at the critical ddi strength by a square - root - like behavior on the ddi parameter .",
    "moreover , we have also numerically investigated issues including the magnetic hysteresis loop , magnetization self - precession , reversal time , and the synchronization stability phase diagram for the two - body system in presence of the ddi .",

    "is analytically obtained and numerically verified in two typical geometric perp and para configurations . in the interesting perp configuration ,",
    "the critical switching current bifurcates at a critical ddi strength with a square - root behavior , near where it can be lowered to about @xmath1 of the usual value without ddi .",
    "moreover , we also numerically investigate the current - induced magnetization hysteresis loops , magnetic self - precession phenomenon , reversal time and the synchronization stability phase diagram in the two - body system , which shows interesting predictions and is expected to be useful for future device applications .",
