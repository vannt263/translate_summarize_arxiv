    "when a flat thin sheet of material is subjected to increasing pressure , it eventually buckles , crumples , or cracks . by buckling , the sheet releases stress over wavelengths much larger than its thickness . during the past years",
    "there has been increasing interest in phenomena , such as crumpling , where the deformation goes from an initial uniform state to a localized region occupying an arbitrarily small fraction of the sample @xcite .",
    "monolayers of surface - active molecules ( surfactants ) , adsorbed on a liquid , are found in many systems containing water ",
    "air or water  oil interfaces @xcite .",
    "such monolayers exhibit a rich variety of collapsed structures under lateral compression , most of which occur on an intermediate scale between the macroscopic one and the molecular thickness of the layer .",
    "fluid monolayers collapse into disks , tubes , or pearls - on - string structures , depending on spontaneous curvature and charge of the lipid monolayer @xcite . like elastic sheets , many solid - like monolayers crack @xcite or buckle @xcite under pressure , yet other solid - like monolayers fail by abrupt buckling into straight , micron - wide folds @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_buckle ] for an example ) .",
    "in addition , liquid - like monolayers may form micron - scale vesicular objects of various shapes @xcite or giant convoluted folds @xcite .",
    "this type of folding is believed to be driven by the interfacial energy gained from the contact across the two sides of the fold @xcite .",
    "thus , the failure of surfactant monolayers under lateral pressure displays distinctive mechanical behaviors , which crucially depend on the in - plane rigidity @xcite and viscoelasticity @xcite .",
    "lipid monolayers and bilayers are the material of choice for spatial partitioning in living matter , such as cells and compartments within them .",
    "these partitions are often observed to fold and wrinkle under stress . in particular , lipid monolayers that model the expanding and contracting sacs in an animal s lung exhibit the abrupt folding signature described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this abrupt buckling is particularly puzzling . the abrupt relaxation motions or ",
    "jerks \" have been extensively characterized for a particular system @xcite , but their distinctive length and time scales have not been explained . why do the jerks occur over a time scale of about 0.1 seconds  far from any molecular or apparatus time - scales ?",
    "why does the motion stop suddenly , before the driving stress is relaxed ? why do the jerks show a robust characteristic displacement of a few microns ?",
    "an intriguing hypothesis to explain this micron length scale was recently proposed by pocivavsek et al @xcite .",
    "these authors recalled that any thin sheet under compression on a liquid substrate buckles at a well - defined wavelength @xmath0 . for lipid monolayers",
    "the expected value of @xmath0 lies in the micron range .",
    "thus it is of the same order as the characteristic displacement of the jerk relaxations .",
    "these authors also noted that the incipient wrinkles at wavelength @xmath0 are unstable against folding , in which the excess wrinkled material from throughout the sample is concentrated into a single loop or fold .",
    "this paper aims to account for the dynamical features of the jerk motion . in section [ sec_system ]",
    "we argue that the monolayer may be viewed as a broad , thin slab that translates almost rigidly during the jerk motion .",
    "then in section [ sec_dynamics ] we describe how such a slab should respond to horizontal forcing , accounting for progressive viscous entrainment of the fluid subphase . using this result ,",
    "combined with experimental observations , we set a lower bound on the kinetic energy of the jerks .",
    "we then survey the possible forces that might give rise to this kinetic energy , notably the energy released by folding in the mechanism of ref .",
    "even upper limits of this folding energy are far less than this observed kinetic energy . in section [ sec_discuss ]",
    "we discuss effects that might account for this kinetic energy .",
    "for definiteness we focus our study on the jerks analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and re - examined in ref .",
    "we begin by reviewing the parameters of this system .",
    "the monolayer was a 7:3 mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) and dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol ( popg ) spread on pure water at room temperature in a @xmath1-cm - long langmuir trough and viewed in a microscope in a 100-micron - wide field of view at conventional video frame rates .",
    "it is compressed at 0.1 mm / sec to a nominal pressure of about 70 mn / meter before viewing .",
    "the measured pressures are consistent with the slight overpressure needed for folding @xcite . in these conditions",
    "this material microphase separates into a biphasic foam - like pattern of compact patches separated by narrow strips of different composition , visualized by a dilute fluorescent additive .",
    "the patches are 15 - 25 microns in size .",
    "the monolayer behaves mechanically as a solid , not a fluid ; the jerks move in the direction of the langmuir barrier motion .",
    "rheological measurements in similar systems showed stress relaxation times of order @xmath2@xmath3 sec.@xcite .",
    "the jerks vary statistically in their net displacement @xmath4 and their duration @xmath5 .",
    "no statistical correlations between jerks were observed .",
    "the displacements @xmath4 vary from a minimum of about 1.2 microns to several times larger , with an average of 2 microns @xcite .",
    "the durations @xmath5 vary from a minimum of about @xmath6 sec to a few times longer , where the average is 0.12 sec .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the larger jerks are cascades of elementary jerks , with this average @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the estimates below",
    ", we use these average @xmath4 and @xmath5 values .",
    "we may simplify our description of the monolayer using three further features .",
    "first , the monolayer may be assumed to translate _ rigidly _ outside the folding region over distances of several cm .",
    "it thus entrains substrate fluid over these distances . in principle",
    "compressibility could invalidate this assumption .",
    "compressibility implies that an initial imbalance of membrane stress produces a compressional wave whose speed is given by , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the two - dimensional uniaxial compression modulus and @xmath9 is the mass density per unit area .",
    "if forces are applied on a timescale @xmath5 , the resulting compression or expansion is confined to distances @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , the compression is negligible and the body moves rigidly if its size @xmath11 is smaller than about @xmath12 .",
    "thus to show that our monolayer translates rigidly , we must establish that @xmath13 is sufficiently large .    for our case",
    "the density @xmath9 is the density of the material to be accelerated in propagating the wave .",
    "since the monolayer entrains substrate fluid as it moves , the density must take account of this subphase .",
    "we may find a lower limit on this @xmath13 by using a lower limit to the modulus @xmath8 and an upper limit for the surface density @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly we estimate @xmath8 by neglecting any compressional effects of the subphase",
    ". measurements of the monolayer compression modulus range from 0.1 n / m to several n / m @xcite .",
    "we use the conservative estimate of @xmath14",
    "n / m below . as for the surface density @xmath9",
    "we find an upper limit by including all the water that might be entrained .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_dynamics ] , an upper limit on the entrained density @xmath9 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 kg / m@xmath18 ) is the density of the water subphase , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 m@xmath21/sec ) is its kinematic viscosity .",
    "thus in the jerk time of 0.12 sec , a local compression can propagate a distance @xmath22 m , i.e. even by our minimal assumption , information from the folding region has reached about half the sample ( 5 cm ) within the jerk time .",
    "thus we expect only minor effects from compressibility of the sheet . in the calculations to follow we will assume @xmath23 cm is the size of the moving sheet .",
    "a second feature of the monolayer is that its compressibility has negligible effect on the energetics of folding . as explained below",
    ", the over - pressure @xmath24 released in the wrinkle - to - fold transition @xcite in this system must be smaller than @xmath25 mn / m .",
    "given the large lower - bound modulus @xmath8 above , the compressive displacement @xmath26 in a system of length @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath27 micron .",
    "it is thus much smaller than the observed displacements @xmath4 .",
    "likewise , the compressive energy released is a small fraction ( @xmath28 ) of the folding energy .",
    "a third feature of these monolayers is that the longitudinal propagation of the fold tips is much faster than the transverse folding and its accompanying jerk . within the temporal resolution of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath29 s ) the fold traverses the field of view ( @xmath30 @xmath31 m ) instantaneously ; this sets a lower bound of @xmath32 mm / s for its speed . in the system of ref.@xcite two types of longitudinal folds",
    "were observed , the slower of which propagated at @xmath33 mm / s . comparing these values with the characteristic translation velocity , @xmath2",
    "@xmath31 m/s @xcite , we see that the requirement is safely fulfilled .",
    "these features allow us to consider a simplified two - dimensional problem of a thin elastic sheet moving over a semi - infinite viscous liquid ( fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] ) .",
    "current understanding @xcite attributes the jerks to the mechanical buckling or wrinkling instability of any elastic sheet that is floating on a liquid and is under compression @xcite . above a threshold pressure @xmath34 ,",
    "the sheet distorts , at a cost of bending energy .",
    "the wrinkles also produce a net upward and downward displacement of the liquid , thus increasing its gravitational energy . taking account of these costs ,",
    "one finds a threshold pressure given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bending stiffness and @xmath37 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the predicted buckling wavelength @xmath0 is given by @xmath38^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "this buckling is unstable , leading to a release of the overpressure @xmath34 over a displacement @xmath39 comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "though @xmath34 is too small to measure directly in our system , it can be estimated either using typical values of @xmath36 or by inferring @xmath36 from the observed jerk displacement . bending stiffness for lipid monolayers like our system",
    "lie in the range @xmath40 j. @xcite .",
    "this @xmath36 value implies an upper bound for @xmath34 : @xmath41 mn / m .",
    "if instead we infer @xmath34 from the observed jerk displacements via @xmath42 , we obtain values of @xmath43 mn / m , i.e. 30 times smaller than our upper bound @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will use the more conservative  upper - bound \" value of @xmath34 , namely @xmath44 mn / meter .",
    "there are many forces in the system that exceed this value - the total pressure from the trough , drift flows , flows from faraway jerks , or residual flows from previous jerks .",
    "however , these larger pressures lack the central feature needed to explain jerks .",
    "the jerks clearly result from an instability , in which a small displacement @xmath4 leads to an increasingly _ unbalanced _ pressure .    to summarize the above discussion , the sheet is assumed to deform in the @xmath45@xmath46 plane while remaining uniform along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "it is laterally compressed by a two - dimensional , uniform pressure @xmath24 .",
    "( in the experimental system @xmath24 is given by the actual pressure exerted at the boundaries minus the surface tension of the liquid . )",
    "prior to instability the monolayer remains flat ( @xmath48 ) and responds to compression by slightly decreasing its actual length .",
    "when the pressure exceeds @xmath34 , the monolayer wrinkles or folds out of the @xmath45@xmath47 plane ( @xmath49 ) . since the pressure @xmath34 produces negligible elastic compression , the total length @xmath11 is fixed , and the displacement @xmath4 along the @xmath45 axis is fully accounted for by the wrinkles or folds . the underlying liquid , having viscosity @xmath50 and mass density @xmath16 , occupies the region @xmath51 .",
    "as noted above , the motion of the sheet depends strongly on the viscous entrainment of the fluid beneath it . in this section",
    "we determine the motion taking account of this entrainment .",
    "we begin with a simplified situation .",
    "suppose we control the surface pressure and increase it above the instability pressure , @xmath52 .",
    "we further suppose that as the sheet begins to fold , the buckled region is decreasing the pressure by a constant amount @xmath24 . at this moment",
    "the forces on the sheet are unbalanced and it begins to accelerate . in all but the small folding region the sheet is horizontal and",
    "its motion is a pure horizontal translation .",
    "the flat sheet adjacent to the fold will translate laterally , thus creating a velocity profile @xmath53 in the underlying liquid . on larger scales this flow produces circulation of fluid in the sample .",
    "we ignore such large scale gestures , since these only increase the kinetic energy and the discrepancy we are discussing .",
    "the resulting viscous drag decreases with time , as the velocity profile penetrates deeper into the liquid and its gradient becomes less sharp .",
    "we shall assume that the sheet s velocity is always equal to that of the water immediately beneath it .",
    "that is , the fluid obeys a no - slip boundary condition .",
    "we examine such assumptions in section [ sec_discuss ] below .",
    "we may neglect the mass of the sheet relative to the much greater mass of the entrained fluid .",
    "thus the problem is simplified to that of finding the velocity of a half infinite fluid due to a rigid surface moving with a constant lateral pressure .",
    "the equation of motion for the fluid is : @xmath54 where @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity given by the ratio of viscosity and density , @xmath55 , and a dot denotes derivative with respect to time .",
    "the constant stress at @xmath56 implies a boundary condition of the form @xmath57 accompanying it are the condition of vanishing flow far away from the interface , @xmath58 and initial conditions of stationarity , @xmath59 eqs ( [ fluid_motion ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) may be simplified by defining the laplace transform @xmath60 by @xmath61 : @xmath62 the solution in laplace space is @xmath63 and in the time domain , @xmath64 ,   \\   \\",
    "\\alpha\\equiv z/(2\\sqrt{\\nu t } ) \\label{solution_real}\\ ] ] the displacement of the sheet is given by integrating the velocity on the surface , @xmath65 , @xmath66 since the accelerated mass is constantly increasing in time , the acceleration @xmath67 decreases with time as @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to the unusual `` jerky '' increase of the velocity @xmath69 . we note that this predicted motion arises from basic hydrodynamics",
    "; it does not depend on the source of the pressure @xmath24 .",
    "we note also that a fixed fraction @xmath70 of the input power @xmath71 goes into kinetic energy ; the remainder goes into viscous dissipation .      buckling relaxes stress at the tip of the fold",
    "; we would therefore expect the driving pressure to depend on the displacement .",
    "the equation for @xmath72 can readily be generalized to include such a @xmath73 .",
    "we discuss it here for completeness .",
    "@xmath74 where the first term on the right is the driving stress , the last term is the stress from the fluid , and @xmath75 is the two - dimensional mass density of the sheet .",
    "for the fluid , eq .",
    "( [ fluid_motion ] ) still applies , and the two are supplemented by a no - slip boundary condition at the interface , @xmath76 a condition of vanishing flow far from the surface ( eq . [ bc2 ] ) , and initial conditions of stationarity ( eq . [ bc3 ] ) .",
    "we proceed by eliminating @xmath77 to obtain an equation for the sheet alone .",
    "the velocity green function of the liquid is given by the boundary condition @xmath78 and eqs .",
    "( [ bc2],[bc3 ] ) .",
    "explicitly , @xmath79    the general solution with the no - slip boundary condition of eq .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) is obtained simply by integration , @xmath80 . inserting this expression in eq .",
    "( [ motion1 ] ) and integrating by parts , produces an equation for the sheet alone : @xmath81 as before , we may neglect the inertial term on the left hand side . for a constant pressure , eq .",
    "( [ power32 ] ) gives the same displacement as eq.([solution_real ] ) .",
    "we may now compare the observed jerk motion with the motion expected from the folding forces .",
    "it is straightforward to solve eq .",
    "( [ power32 ] ) using the predicted ( quadratic ) @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the resulting motion proves to be much slower than the observed jerks .",
    "we may quantify this discrepancy in two ways .",
    "first we ask what constant pressure @xmath24 would be required to give the observed displacements @xmath4 in the observed time @xmath5 .",
    "then we determine the observed kinetic energy and compare it to the energy available from folding .    to find the pressure required to produce the observed jerks , we substitute @xmath82 microns and @xmath83 sec into eq .",
    "( [ power32 ] ) , to obtain @xmath84 mn / m .",
    "this is some 50 times larger than the upper - bound folding pressure @xmath85 mn / m obtained above .",
    "the same discrepancy emerges if we compare the observed kinetic energy @xmath86 with the work @xmath87 done by the pressure difference @xmath73 .",
    "both are proportional to the width @xmath88 of the jerking region .",
    "the pressure @xmath73 is always smaller than @xmath34 throughout the folding .",
    "thus @xmath89 n . other things being equal ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath86 for a given average velocity @xmath90 is larger if @xmath5 is larger ( since larger @xmath5 implies a greater entrained mass ) .",
    "thus we may obtain a lower bound on the kinetic energy by limiting @xmath5 to the observed duration of @xmath91 sec . for the moment we simply use the constant - pressure solution of eq .",
    "( [ solution_real ] ) and use @xmath92 \\label{max_kinetic}\\ ] ] we examine this estimate in sec .",
    "[ sec_discuss ] . for @xmath93",
    "m , @xmath82 microns and @xmath83 sec , this gives @xmath94 n  some 32 times our upper bound of the work @xmath87 supplied by folding .",
    "thus even when one ignores the work that must go into viscous dissipation , the observed energy is far larger than what the folding energy , @xmath87 , can supply .",
    "( taking account of the dissipated energy , one recovers the factor-50 discrepancy quoted above . )",
    "the arguments above indicate a worrisome discrepancy between the observed jerking motion and the mechanics of folding presumed to account for this motion . the discrepancy is serious ; it survives even when we use conservative bounds in our estimates . in this section",
    "we survey possible ways to account for the discrepancy .",
    "first we review possible flaws in our description of the kinetic energy and the folding forces .",
    "then we consider other forces that might account for the jerking motions .",
    "our estimate of the kinetic energy was a simplified one , but it gives a proper lower bound for a given displacement @xmath4 and time @xmath5 .",
    "we will proceed by reinforcing several of the assumptions .",
    "firstly , we assumed a constant pressure , though the actual unbalanced pressure increases with time .",
    "however other choices would have led to a higher kinetic energy .",
    "we consider the effect of replacing our constant - pressure estimate by allowing the pressure to increase with time . in order to achieve the required @xmath95 in the given time @xmath5 with a time - increasing pressure",
    ", we will necessarily reduce @xmath96 at early times and increase it at late times",
    ". however , any shift of @xmath96 from earlier to later times has the effect of increasing the kinetic energy . to see this",
    ", we consider a small decrease of @xmath96 at time @xmath97 over a brief interval @xmath98 . to maintain a fixed total displacement @xmath4",
    ", we make an equal addition to @xmath96 at a later time @xmath99 .",
    "any shift of @xmath96 from earlier to later times can be accomplished by repeating this process .",
    "this perturbation of @xmath96 creates a corresponding perturbation of the fluid velocity at the final time @xmath5 : we denote it by @xmath100 .",
    "we may then express the final kinetic energy @xmath101 in terms of this @xmath102 and the initial profile @xmath103 using the integral of eq .",
    "[ solution_real ] .",
    "@xmath104 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & = e_{0k}(t)/w + l \\rho \\int dz~ v_0(z , t)~ \\delta v(z , t ) ~~+ { \\cal o } ( \\delta v^2 ) \\label{kineticdeltav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second perturbing term is necessarily positive provided the ( positive ) @xmath105 profile is monotonic . to see this we express @xmath102 in terms of the green function @xmath106 of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) : @xmath107.\\ ] ] we may express any monotonic @xmath108 as a sum of positive step functions extending from 0 to some @xmath109 . for a given step function , the contribution to @xmath86 is given by @xmath110 .",
    "thus it suffices to show that this integral is positive . in terms of the @xmath106 functions ,",
    "this means @xmath111 is an increasing function of @xmath112 .",
    "this may be verified explicitly using eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "thus a small shift in the pressure profile from a constant one to an increasing one with the same @xmath4 and @xmath5 only increases the energy @xmath86 .",
    "if further small shifts are added , the same reasoning implies that the @xmath86 again increases , provided the starting @xmath105 remains monotonic in @xmath46 .",
    "we conclude that the constant - pressure @xmath86 of eq .",
    "( [ max_kinetic ] ) under - estimates @xmath86 .",
    "a second assumption that affects our estimate of the kinetic energy is the no - slip boundary condition between the sliding monolayer and the fluid beneath . having a slip would cause less drag of the fluid and thus less kinetic energy .",
    "but in our case of hydrophilic heads facing the water , there is no justification for a significant slip .    a further effect that can potentially reduce the kinetic energy is the possibility that the motion is restricted in area , so that less fluid is entrained .",
    "as noted above , this restriction can occur if the surface layer is compressible .",
    "the expected compressibility is such that there could be a noticeable effect on the scale of the entire @xmath1 cm sample . to account for this",
    ", we assumed that the motion is restricted to a range of only 5 cm . on this scale we argued that any departure from rigid sliding of the sheet would be negligible .",
    "one possibility we did not consider is that the modulus of the sheet , @xmath8 , is smaller than observed in experiments ( that dealt with sheets without any folds ) .",
    "the existence of folds would make the material weaker , softer .",
    "if that is indeed the case , the part of the sheet that moves rigidly due to jerking could be smaller .",
    "however , in order to resolve the discrepancy , the rigid moving part must be a few millimeters at most , which is not consistent with the statistics of observed jerks @xcite .    another potential way to resolve",
    "this discrepancy is that we have _ under_estimated the folding pressure @xmath24 .",
    "as was noted in section [ sec_dynamics ] , the creation of a fold reduces the pressure .",
    "since folding must occur when the pressure exceeds @xmath113 no greater excess pressure can be sustained .",
    "this is true even if additional folds are present .",
    "could it be that @xmath114 mn / m ? this would imply that we have greatly underestimated the bending rigidity @xmath36 .",
    "the local structure of the monolayer might imply a bending rigidity greater than is usually observed due to texture in the sheet @xcite , but how much larger ? equating the folding and kinetic energies requires @xmath34 of at least @xmath115 i.e. @xmath116 j a suspiciously larger value .",
    "we do not see how to resolve the kinetic discrepancy discussed here without departing qualitatively from the wrinkle - to - fold model of ref .",
    "@xcite . to resolve the discrepancy , either the kinetic energy must be smaller than our conservative bounds or",
    "the driving force must be stronger than our bounds .",
    "the former possibility seems unlikely .",
    "our estimates for the kinetic energy are based on direct observations of the motion , together with simple and unquestioned hydrodynamics . however , our account of the driving force depends explicitly on the mechanical properties of a folding monolayer leading to the pressure @xmath34 that we estimated .",
    "perhaps this mechanical picture is wrong .",
    "what other forces are strong enough to trigger the observed motion ?",
    "one possible force is the force of adhesion between two folds that touch .",
    "these forces are comparable to the surface tension of the fluid and are thus many times larger in magnitude than the pressure @xmath34 .",
    "if adhesion forces are responsible , then the observed jerks must take place only after the folds have touched .",
    "this leaves unexplained how the folds came to touch and what causes the jerking to stop .",
    "a second way to have a larger force is to abandon our picture of a simple molecular monolayer .",
    "the observed jerks occur when many folds are already present .",
    "the out - of - plane structure from these prior folds could well impart great rigidity to the surface layer and increase its buckling pressure by a large factor .",
    "if such structures were important , it would qualitatively alter our picture of how the jerks occur .",
    "there would no longer be a clear connection to the simple wrinkle - to - fold model that gave a plausible account of the jerk displacements .",
    "the force responsible for jerks in the monolayers of ref .",
    "@xcite may well be important in a broader context .",
    "the wrinkle - fold transition has been implicated in a broader class of nanoscale systems : nanoparticle trilayers @xcite and single - component lipid monolayers @xcite .",
    "the various energies in these systems are different , and the motion is also somewhat different from that of ref .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy shown above may also apply to these other systems .",
    "it is also possible that the force responsible for jerks affects structure as well as dynamics .",
    "that is , the magnitude of a fold may be governed by other characteristic lengths than the wrinkle wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "still , the incipient instability might be due to the wrinkle - fold mechanism while the rapid subsequent motion is controlled by adhesion or some other force .",
    "this work highlights the distinctive dynamics of thin solid sheets on fluids in general .",
    "equation ( [ power32 ] ) applies whenever such a sheet is accelerated by an unbalanced force , whether folding occurs or not .",
    "the equations imply a distinctive form of acceleration and a distinctive partitioning of the supplied work into kinetic energy and dissipation .",
    "the wrinkle - to - fold mechanism @xcite for thin film buckling has allowed a new avenue for understanding buckling phenomena in a range of nanoscale systems .",
    "its successes in explaining structural aspects of folding have led us to apply it to the well - studied dynamics of monolayer jerks . for these dynamic phenomena",
    ", our study indicates that other forces are at play .",
    "supporting this conclusion are experiments on lipid - coated micro - bubbles , where it is clear that gravity , an important ingredient of the folding mechanism , plays no role @xcite .",

    "<S> these limits imply a kinetic energy at least thirty times greater than the energy supplied by the buckling instability . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible extensions of the accepted picture that might resolve this discrepancy . </S>"
