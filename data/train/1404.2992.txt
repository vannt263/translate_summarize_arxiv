    "several statistical methods allow testing of the relationships between the cell entries of a @xmath4 contingency table .",
    "pearson s @xmath2 is a popular test for independence between the rows and columns of a data table , and is calculated as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the observed and expected values for the cell entries , respectively , @xmath8 the number of rows , and @xmath9 the number of columns . for this test",
    ", @xmath3-values are obtained from the @xmath2 distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom , and the null hypothesis is rejected when @xmath3 is smaller than a chosen critical point . however , this test has several limiting assumptions .",
    "sample size is expected to be sufficiently large , or type ii error rates may increase .",
    "in addition , cell entries for a @xmath0 table are expected to be at least 5 , below which type i error rates tend to increase .",
    "there is a correction available if the latter assumption proves false . _",
    "yates s correction _ ( @xcite ) subtracts 0.5 from the difference between observed and expected values for each cell entry , thereby increasing @xmath3-values .",
    "however , the method tends to over - correct , leading again to increased type ii error rates .",
    "another method is r.a .",
    "fisher s eponymous fisher s exact test ( fet ) , which can handle low cell entries , and additionally benefits from the elimination of nuisance parameters by conditioning on sufficient statistics ( see @xcite for a review of the benefits of exact tests )",
    ". fisher demonstrated that conditional on the row and column margin totals , the distribution of a cell entry follows the hypergeometric distribution .",
    "the test is very useful for categorical data , with the caveat that it can only be used on contingency tables with discrete cell entries , since the hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution .",
    "this limitation can be significant in many instances .",
    "for example , contingency tables are sometimes constructed as averages ( due to limited sampling ability ) , or represent estimates from continuous approximations . in population genetics , it is common to ask whether species evolve at different rates , or whether natural selection has been operating on a given gene .",
    "data to address these questions can be summarized using @xmath4 contingency tables in the following manner . after sequencing and aligning a gene across multiple species , observed mutations",
    "can be cross - classified as either non - synonymous mutations ( which occur when a dna mutation causes a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein ) or synonymous ( which occur when a dna mutation in a protein - coding region of the genome does not affect the amino acid sequence ) , and whether they occurred in one set of species or another .    however , not all mutations can necessarily be observed , particularly for distantly related species . this is because multiple dna substitutions can serially arise at a single site , thereby masking the true number of events that have occurred .",
    "the most common way to model the evolutionary process is to assume a continuous approximation , or to calculate the expected number of dna substitutions from a poisson process .",
    "clearly , both of these modeling approaches lead to non - integer estimates for substitution counts .",
    "moreover , for some common population genetics tasks , some cell entries are continuous while others are discrete .",
    "this arises for instance with the mcdonald - kreitman test ( @xcite ) , which compares substitutions across species ( continuous ) versus polymorphic mutations within a species ( often discrete ) .    to address challenges such as these",
    ", we derive a statistical test that extends fet to the non - negative real line @xmath10 .",
    "we call our procedure the continuous fisher s exact test ( cfet )",
    ". we evaluate its performance through simulations under the null hypothesis , and find that when all cell entries are treated as continuous , cfet has a distribution of p - values that is nearly uniform ( as compared to fet , which is highly skewed and conservative ) .",
    "when the null hypothesis is false , we find that cfet is a more powerful test than the common practice of rounding cell entries to their nearest integer and applying fet .",
    "we then apply cfet to a genome - wide data set of protein coding genes that have been aligned across human , rhesus macaque , mouse and rat to examine differences in evolutionary rates between primates and rodents .",
    "we find several statistically significant genes that highlight the interesting evolutionary history of primates .",
    "in this section , we introduce a framework for extending the binomial distribution to allow for a mixture of continuous and discrete values . in the next section ,",
    "we extend the model further to consider the general case of two continuous values .",
    "we then derive a new exact test for @xmath4 contingency tables with discrete and/or continuous cell entries .",
    "consider a general @xmath4 contingency table as shown in table [ gentable ] , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the primary random variables of interest , with the additional random variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 representing the two row sums and first column sum ( respectively ) .",
    "following the derivation of fet , assume an observed table with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "further assume that the distribution of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "this could arise , for example , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , if @xmath23 but @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , then the strict binomial modeling assumption is violated .",
    "instead , we can extend the binomial distribution using newton s generalized binomial theorem , which states the following result for @xmath27 ( or even @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "for the general scenario shown in table [ gentable ] with a mixture of continuous and discrete cell entries , we say that the conditional distribution of @xmath11 given @xmath13 follows a continuous / discrete binomial distribution , which we write as @xmath31 .",
    "we define this distribution as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a normalizing constant . the corresponding probability for @xmath12 could also be constructed .",
    "drawing from the analogy of @xmath34 to the binomial distribution , we note that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the proof of this is analogous to proving that the sum of binomial random variables ( with the same probability of success ) is also a binomial random variable by writing @xmath39 and utilizing newton s generalized binomial theorem to show that @xmath40 .",
    "we next turn to the case of all four cell entries being continuous before deriving our new statistical test .",
    "now suppose we have table [ gentable ] where @xmath41 . in this case , all cell entries are continuous , and there is yet another extension of the binomial model that can applied .",
    "the gamma function is an extension of the factorial function to the real line @xmath42 , shifted by one . that is , for a natural number @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and for any @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "this function has been used to extend the binomial coefficient to the non - negative real line @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will refer to this quantity as the continuous binomial coefficient , and define it as follows for @xmath47 with @xmath48 : @xmath49    in this way , if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are non - negative integers , then ( [ m1 ] ) returns the classic binomial coefficient . if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then ( [ m1 ] ) returns newton s generalized binomial coefficient from section [ sec2.1 ]",
    "otherwise , this provides the functional form necessary to interpolate .",
    "note that @xmath54 is similar , but not equal to the inverse beta function .",
    "we can now use this to extend the binomial probability distribution to the non - negative real line , where if @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then @xmath58 } \\label{m2}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a normalizing constant .",
    "a closed - form solution for @xmath60 has not been found , but it is easily obtained numerically and , as we show below , is irrelevant for the development of our exact test .",
    "returning to table [ gentable ] , assume that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . similar to section [ sec2.1 ] , drawing from the analogy of @xmath63 to the binomial distribution , we note that @xmath64 , where @xmath38 .",
    "we note that if @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then while @xmath67 , the distribution of @xmath68 does not follow a known distribution .",
    "however , figure [ cbinvgamma ] shows that cbin ( ) is a good approximation , at least for the parameters evaluated here .",
    "this is an important development , as the gamma distribution is a natural extension of the poisson distribution to @xmath69 . for figure [ cbinvgamma ]",
    ", we simulated @xmath70 @xmath71 pairs with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we then plot the distribution of @xmath11 conditional on @xmath74 being within a defined range .",
    "explicitly , we plot the distribution of @xmath75 , and see very good agreement when we overlay the cbin(24 , 1/3 ) distribution .      our goal is to test the null hypothesis @xmath76 for both the case of a mixture of discrete and continuous cell entries presented in section [ sec2.1 ] and for the case in which all four cell entries are continuous as presented in section [ sec2.2 ] .",
    "to do so , we test the conditional distribution of @xmath11 given the row ( @xmath77 ) and column ( @xmath15 ) sums , analogous to what is done in fet .",
    "we derive our exact test for table [ gentable ] assuming @xmath41 .",
    "the derivation for the case of @xmath78 but @xmath79 is analogous , exchanging integration for summation .    under the null hypothesis in fet , @xmath80 , and the distribution of @xmath81 .",
    "the following algebraic manipulations lead us to a continuous version of the hypergeometric distribution : @xmath82    since @xmath83 , we must have @xmath84 , demonstrating that the conditional distribution is independent of the nuisance parameter @xmath3",
    ". we will refer to the resulting distribution as a continuous hypergeometric distribution , and write @xmath85    the test for significance is similar to that of fet , but using numerical integration .",
    "let @xmath86 and @xmath87 be the minimal and maximal values @xmath11 can take on such that all the cell entries are non - negative when conditioning on the marginal totals @xmath88 and @xmath50",
    ". then for the general case of table [ gentable ] , and @xmath89 in ( [ m3 ] ) , let @xmath90 to get a p - value for @xmath91 , we use @xmath92    for the case of a mixture of discrete and continuous cell entries presented in section [ sec2.1 ] , the test is directly analogous to fet , and can be similarly derived by replacing numerical integration with summation .      in population genetics and comparative genomics ,",
    "one is often interested in comparing orthologous genes across species to detect instances of natural selection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , if species are sufficiently diverged , the number of dna substitutions that have arisen can not necessarily be observed .",
    "this is because multiple substitutions may have occurred at the same site , thereby masking the true number of events .",
    "instead , researchers often infer the rate at which substitutions have occurred under a parametric model . to detect natural selection ,",
    "the goal is to estimate the rate of non - synonymous substitutions per non - synonymous site in a gene ( @xmath93 ) and the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site in a gene ( @xmath94 ) . since non - synonymous mutations change the makeup of the protein coded for by the gene , the @xmath95 ratio can be seen as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein - coding gene .",
    "a @xmath95 ratio of one indicates no selection , a ratio greater than one implies positive darwinian selection , and less than one implies purifying ( stabilizing ) selection .",
    "another formulation of the test is to construct a @xmath96 contingency table as shown in table [ relratetable ] for the example of comparing selective pressures in rodents versus primates . in this case , we need the number of synonymous and non - synonymous substitutions that have occurred in each lineage , either within rodents ( determined by comparing the mouse and rat genomes ) or within primates ( determined by comparing human and rhesus genomes ) . given an observed number of substitutions for each cell entry of this @xmath96 table , one could then perform a fet .",
    "but , given the large divergence time between each of these sets of species , parsimoniously counting substitutions can be biased ( see @xcite ) . by estimating the total number of positions in a gene at which a non - synonymous ( @xmath50 ) or synonymous ( @xmath97 ) mutation could arise , the expected number of non - synonymous and synonymous substitutions can then be obtained from the products @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "but , since @xmath93 and @xmath94 are rates they are always continuous .",
    "we therefore have @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 as the expected number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in primates ( and analogously @xmath102 and @xmath103 for rodents ) . instead of fet",
    ", we can use cfet ( derived in section [ sec2.3 ] ) on the resulting @xmath4 table with continuous cell entries .",
    "this test can be interpreted as a relative evolutionary rates test , where the null hypothesis is that the odds ratio of the @xmath4 table is equal to one ( i.e. , that the primate and rodent @xmath95 ratios are equal ) .",
    "another scenario that frequently arises in population genetics is where one column in a @xmath4 table is more easily observed than the other . in the mcdonald - kreitman test ( @xcite ) ,",
    "one compares synonymous and non - synonymous variants that are either substitutions across species or polymorphic within a species .",
    "depending on the species being compared , an order of magnitude less polymorphisms might be observed compared to substitutions .",
    "it is therefore often reliable to assume that there are not multiple mutations segregating at the same site within the population ( i.e. , the infinite sites assumptions , where polymorphisms can be observed directly ) .",
    "the number of substitutions , however , can be large enough that statistical estimation of the expected number of substitutions is required as above . in this case , the resulting @xmath4 table consists of a column of polymorphisms that are natural numbers , and a column of substitutions that are non - negative real numbers .",
    "such a @xmath0 table can be analyzed using cfet based on the distribution derived in section [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "to test the power and type - i error of cfet , we simulated @xmath0 tables and generated graphical representations of comparisons between the application of cfet and fet ( after rounding ) to these tables .",
    "rather than drawing cell entries from _",
    "_ c__bin , they were simulated via the gamma distribution @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the `` shape '' parameter and @xmath106 is the `` scale '' parameter .",
    "the mean of this distribution is @xmath107 and its variance is @xmath108 here , we always set @xmath109 so that the mean equaled the variance in our simulations , to mimic the properties of the poisson distribution extended to @xmath69 .",
    "we chose to simulate data from the gamma distribution to better mimic the cell entries we might observe in data rather than drawing cell entries directly from the distributions we derive in sections [ sec2.1]-[sec2.2 ] .",
    "considering the setup in table [ gentable ] , let @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we evaluated cfet with @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for each pair of @xmath114 and @xmath115 in @xmath116",
    ", we simulated 10,000 data tables with @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "for each simulated data table , we applied cfet , then rounded the cell entries to the nearest integer and applied fet .",
    "the distribution of p - values for each test ( as well as the proportion of simulated tables rejected at the 0.05 level ) are reported in figure [ pvaldist ] .",
    "figure [ pvalscat ] shows a smoothed scatter plot of the @xmath121 for fet ( applied to rounded cell entries ) versus cfet when @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , along with vertical and horizontal lines to indicate @xmath125 .",
    "points in the upper right quadrant indicate tables for which both tests reject @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , points in the upper left and lower right indicate tables in which only one of the methods ( fet or cfet , respectively ) rejected @xmath91 .",
    "the skew of @xmath3-values below the diagonal line indicates that in general , cfet has more power than applying fet after rounding . for these parameters , cfet rejects @xmath91 for @xmath126 more tables fet ( applied to rounded cell entries ) .",
    "tests evaluating cfet with a mixture of discrete and continuous cell entries resulted in @xmath3-value distributions that were nearly indistinguishable from fet , and are not shown .",
    "we obtained 4,375 human protein coding genes that could be accurately aligned to rhesus macaque , mouse , and rat ( @xcite ) . to test for differences in the evolutionary rate in the primate versus rodent lineage",
    ", we used paml ( @xcite ) to infer the number of synonymous and non - synonymous dna substitutions that occurred in the primate lineage ( e.g. , human or rhesus ) or the rodent lineage ( e.g. , mouse or rat ) .",
    "we created @xmath0 tables following the structure shown in table [ relratetable ] , and analyzed all tables using cfet .",
    "figure [ orqq]a shows the distribution of ln(odds ratio)@xmath127 across all tables .",
    "the interpretation of this quantity is the log fold change in @xmath95 between species . under the null hypothesis that rodents and primates evolve at the same rates",
    ", we would expect this distribution to be centered around zero .",
    "instead , we find that the distribution is shifted to toward positive values , with 520 genes ( @xmath128 ) having an odds ratio @xmath129 with @xmath130 , as compared to only 127 genes ( @xmath131 ) having an odds ratio @xmath132 with @xmath130 .",
    "we find that the average evolutionary rate for primates has been greater than rodents for the genes we were able to accurately align .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous observations using different methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "we next sought to statistically test the observed @xmath0 tables using cfet . in figure [ orqq]b",
    ", we show the qq - plot for our observed -log@xmath133(@xmath3-value ) versus their expectations after controlling for global inflation of significant @xmath3-values .",
    "we find that several genes significantly deviate from the null hypothesis .",
    "the genes with @xmath134 surpass bonferroni correction , and are shown in table [ siggenes ] .",
    "we find two genes lyg1 and lhb have @xmath3-values below the resolution of our implementation of cfet ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "consistent with the odds ratio distribution shown in figure [ orqq]a , eight of our top nine genes show significantly elevated evolutionary rates in primates compared to rodents .",
    "the alignments for all genes shown in table [ siggenes ] have been manually verified , and confirmed using two independent protocols including muscle ( @xcite ; downloaded from ) and mosaic ( @xcite ) .    to understand whether our top genes show",
    "continued rapid evolution in the human lineage , we performed a genome - wide analysis of mcdonald - kreitman tables , where substitutions were inferred to have occurred along the human lineage since our divergence with chimpanzee ( using @xcite alignments ) , and polymorphisms from the 1000 genomes project ( @xcite ) .",
    "the continuous / discrete form of cfet failed to identify any genome - wide significant tables due to lack of power .",
    "we instead used the poisson random effects model snipre ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , ubxn10 exhibits one of the strongest signatures of human lineage selection in the genome , suggesting that much of this gene s signal of rapid evolution in primates may be due to human - lineage - specific evolutionary pressures .",
    "we then inspected signatures of very recent natural selection in humans using the ihs statistic ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this statistic looks for abnormally long haplotypes at high frequency , indicative of recent positive selection .",
    "our top gene from the cfet analysis , lyg1 , is within the top @xmath136 of all genes in the genome for this statistic .",
    "this suggests that this gene may be under continued evolutionary pressure in modern humans .",
    "in the analysis of @xmath0 contingency tables , exact tests , such as fisher s exact test ( fet ) , are appealing because conditioning on sufficient statistics causes nuisance parameters to cancel out .",
    "however , fet can not be applied to @xmath0 tables with non - integer entries .",
    "such tables frequently arise , such as when some or all of the cell entries are not directly observed , but , rather , are inferred as the expectation from a model . here",
    "we present two such scenarios where this arises , one in population genetics ( the mcdonald - kreitman test when outgroup species are sufficiently diverged ) and one from comparative genomics ( in the case of a relative evolutionary rates test ) .    to surmount the problem of cell counts that lie along the non - negative real line , we developed cfet , a continuous analog of fisher s exact test .",
    "our test is based on the extension of the notion of binomial coefficients to the real line using either newton s generalized binomial theorem ( in the case of a mixture of discrete and continuous cell entries ) or interpolating between integer values using the @xmath137 function .",
    "we show that in the case of all cell entries being continuous , cfet has a distribution of @xmath3-values that are nearly uniform under the null hypothesis , and has more power than fet when applied to cell entries that have been rounded .",
    "we applied cfet to a genome - wide set of 4,375 human transcripts that could be accurately aligned across rhesus macaque , mouse and rat .",
    "we find evidence for an overall increased evolutionary rate among primates compared to rodents .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations using different analyses ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find 13 genes with @xmath3-values that exceed the bonferroni corrected threshold ( see table [ siggenes ] for the top 9 with @xmath134 ) .",
    "in contrast , applying fet to rounded cell entries yields eight genes that surpass the stringent bonferroni correction .",
    "this observation is consistent with our simulations showing increased power for cfet compared to fet .",
    "these genes highlight fundamental aspects of mammalian evolution , eight of which exhibit significantly elevated rates among primates compared to rodents .",
    "our top gene from this analysis is lysozyme g - like 1 ( lyg1 ) , which is thought to be an anti - bacterial enzyme , and highlights the importance that pathogens have had in shaping the human genome .",
    "interestingly , lyg1 also shows signatures of very recent positive selection in modern humans ( in the top @xmath136 of all human proteins ) .",
    "this suggests that there are likely ongoing selective pressures operating on the human genome , perhaps the result of continued host - pathogen interactions .",
    "another gene , ubxn10 has not been well studied , but exhibits among the top scores in the entire proteome for natural selection along the human lineage since our divergence with chimpanzee 5 - 7 million years ago .",
    "it remains to be determined what fraction of these genes that have undergone significantly increased evolutionary rates in primates compared to rodents are involved in shaping uniquely human phenotypes and disease ( @xcite ) .",
    "while we have largely explored applications of cfet within population genetics and comparative genomics , there are potentially many other uses of cfet . for example , in gene expression studies , one often obtains quantitative expression values that are continuous . to test whether a gene is over- or under - expressed in a particular tissue compared to one or more housekeeping genes , one could apply cfet as an exact test for differential expression .",
    "the method developed here is flexible , and can readily be extended in multiple ways whenever observations lie outside of @xmath101 .",
    "cfet is implemented in the ` c ` programming language , and is available upon request or from the corresponding author s webpage ( ) .",
    "numerical integration has been implemented using romberg s method as implemented in @xcite .",
    "the current implementation provides a highly efficient implementation of the original fisher s exact test , as well as both extensions described herein ( for continuous as well as a mixture of discrete and continuous data ) .",
