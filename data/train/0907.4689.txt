    "it is now widely accepted that the universe is presently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite , the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite and the clustering properties probing the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite are concordant pieces of evidence in favour of this cosmic speed up . in the concordance @xmath3cdm cosmological model , this wide dataset",
    "is excellently reproduced @xcite by assuming a spatially flat universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite . however , this scenario has two serious drawbacks : ( 1 ) if interpreted as vacuum energy , the @xmath3 value is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than what is expected from quantum field theory ; ( 2 ) the coincidence and fine - tuning problems do not seem to have a natural explanation . this circumstance has motivated the search for alternative explanations .",
    "they mostly rely on scalar fields with a suitable potential which provides a varying @xmath3 term or other dark energy fluids @xcite with exotic properties .",
    "an alternative route towards solving the problem of the accelerated cosmic expansion may be explored by looking at the cosmological constant as an additive constant term in the einstein - hilbert gravity lagrangian : from the point of view of the field equations , one is not adding any new source term to the energy - momentum tensor , but rather it is the geometrical sector ( the left - hand side of the equations ) that has been modified .",
    "it is therefore worth wondering whether the accelerated expansion can indeed be obtained by generalizing this approach , i.e. by adding other non - linear terms to the action .",
    "the search for a generalization of einstein general relativity ( gr ) actually dates back to just few years after the seminal einstein papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a historical review ) , but the relevance of these corrective terms were considered to be restricted only to the strong gravity regimes . moreover , effective field theory considerations motivated the introduction of small couplings which suppress these non - linear terms in all the other curvature regimes . as a consequence , corrections to gr",
    "were considered only close to the planck scale , i.e. in the very early - universe @xcite , and in the attempt to avoid black hole singularities @xcite .",
    "the qualitative similarities between the present - day acceleration and the early universe inflationary expansion renewed the interest in what are now collectively referred to as _",
    "@xmath1 theories_. indeed , it became clear soon that an accelerated expansion in a matter only universe can be achieved by suitably choosing the functional expression for @xmath1 leading to a non - linear gravity lagrangian , @xmath4 .",
    "the impressive amount of papers @xcite investigating different aspects of @xmath1 theories helps understanding that the success in explaining the cosmic acceleration must be balanced by the constraints provided by the local gravity tests ( see , e.g. , @xcite for exhaustive reviews discussing these issues ) .",
    "indeed , many models providing an accelerated expansion were later rejected because the non - linear terms do not turn off their effect on the solar system scale and thus lead to unacceptable contrast with the success of gr in this regime .",
    "recently , two models carefully designed to evade the local gravity tests but still providing an accelerated cosmic expansion has been proposed @xcite",
    ". however , neither of these models has yet been quantitatively tested against the available astrophysical data . here , in order to to further support ( or rule out ) @xmath1 theories as alternative candidates to the dark energy hypothesis , we search for the appropriate set of parameters of these models to verify that the acceleration , that they qualitatively predict , actually quantitevely agree with the data .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "ii , we will briefly remind the basics of @xmath1 theories writing down the equations needed to determine the background evolution of the universe .",
    " iii discusses the theoretical constraints driving the choice of a functional expression for @xmath1 thus motivating the adoption of the two popular models to be tested .",
    "the data used and the statistical method used to constrain the model parameters are presented in ",
    "iv , while the results of the analysis are commented upon in  v. conclusions and future perspectives",
    "are finally given in ",
    "the idea of modifying the gravity sector of the einsteinian general relativity ( gr ) dates back to the starobinsky @xcite attempts to get an inflationary expansion of the early universe without the need of any scalar field .",
    "this can be accomplished by generalizing the einstein - hilbert action as : @xmath5 } \\label{eq : fogaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature , @xmath7 ( we use units where the light speed @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the standard matter lagrangian , and @xmath1 is an analytical function expressing the deviation from the einstein gr . for @xmath10 , we get back the concordance @xmath3cdm model , while nontrivial dynamics is obtained for other choices .    under the metric approach to @xmath1 gravity ,",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying the action ( [ eq : fogaction ] ) with respect to the metric only .",
    "we obtain : @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the usual einstein and source stress - energy tensor .",
    "hereafter the subscript @xmath6 will denote differentiation with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume a spatially flat robertson - walker metric , with scale factor @xmath14 ; in this case , the scalar curvature reads    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the hubble parameter and the dot indicates the time derivative ; by using the more convenient variable @xmath17 , we denote the derivative with respect to @xmath18 with a prime . with these definitions , eqs.([eq : fogfield ] ) lead to the modified friedmann equation@xmath19 where we have assumed that dust matter with enery density @xmath20 and pressure @xmath21 is the only fluid filling the universe .",
    "to solve eqs.([eq : defr ] ) and ( [ eq : fogfried ] ) , we follow @xcite and introduce the dimensionless variables : @xmath22 with    @xmath23    a convenient curvature scale depending on the present day values of the matter density parameter @xmath24 and the hubble constant @xmath25 .",
    "the background evolution of the universe is determined by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath26 @xmath27 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : yrpeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the above system of equations of first order in @xmath28 is equivalent to a single second order equation in @xmath29 .",
    "if we look at the definition of @xmath29 , we see that the full system is equivalent to a single fourth - order non - linear differential equation for the scale factor @xmath30 : this property explains why @xmath1 theories are also commonly referred to as fourth - order gravity theories .    in order to integrate the system , we need to set the boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    ", the authors set them at redshifts @xmath31 , by requiring that @xmath1 tends to a constant at this epoch and by considering the detailed balance of the perturbative corrections to @xmath32 .",
    "however , here we are interested in fitting the model to data that probe the range @xmath33 ; therefore , it is more interesting to set the present day values of @xmath28 and integrate the equations back in time up to @xmath34 @xmath35 . by setting , as usual , @xmath36 and remembering that @xmath37 with @xmath38 the deceleration parameter , we get : @xmath39 it is worth noting that , because of eq.([eq : defm ] ) , the initial conditions ( [ eq : incond ] ) are determined by the values of the three parameters @xmath40 .",
    "this is again consistent with @xmath1 models being fourth - order theories ; thus , we require three initial conditions to determine the evolution of the scale factor for any given @xmath1 .",
    "had we written down a single equation for @xmath30 , we should have set the present - day values of the first three time derivatives of @xmath30 which include the jerk parameter @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , the introduction of the @xmath28 auxiliary functions and of the curvature scale @xmath42 enables us to replace the quite uncertain jerk parameter with the more manageable matter density @xmath24 .",
    "a key role in fourth - order gravity is obviosuly played by the functional expression of @xmath1 . in principle , such a choice is fully arbitrary unless one has a theoretical motivation leading to a unique expression for @xmath1 .",
    "actually , things are not so easy .",
    "indeed , the modification of gr introduces deviations not only on the cosmological scales , but at all the scales where gravitational phenomena can be tested . in particular , it has proven to be quite difficult for a large class of @xmath1 theories to evade the constraints on the solar system scale ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs therein ) . as chiba @xcite has shown , the main difficulty arises from @xmath1 models introducing a new scalar degree of freedom with the same coupling to matter as gravity . as a consequence",
    ", it appears a long range fifth force that violates the constraints on the ppn parameters .",
    "although the derivation of the ppn parameters has been questioned @xcite , significant deviations from the gr metric around the sun seem to be confirmed because of a decoupling of the scalar curvature from the local density . as a possible way out",
    ", one can invoke a chamaleon effect @xcite to reassociate high density with high curvature so that the scalar degree of freedom becomes very massive and the fifth force escapes any detection . to this aim",
    ", @xmath1 should be tailored in such a way to give rise to a mass squared term which is large and positive in high curvature environments @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that this same condition is also required if we want to recover gr in the early universe @xcite and obtain the usual matter dominated era . since @xmath43 in this limit",
    ", we expect that @xmath1 tends to a small constant in order to make its effect negligible with respect to the gr term . on the other hand , in the late universe",
    ", we expect to mimic the same evolutionary history of the @xmath3cdm because this model agrees with the data ; therefore @xmath1 should reduce again to a small constant , but it should again tend to zero in the limit of a vanishing @xmath6 to agree with the observational fact that @xmath3 takes a very low value . summarizing",
    ", one has to look for a functional expression satisfying the following constraints : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a typical curvature scale and the last condition @xcite ensures that , in the limit @xmath46 , the solution is stable at high curvature .    among the possible choices left out by the above conditions , we will consider here two classes of @xmath1 models .",
    "for the first one , we follow @xcite and set : @xmath47 with @xmath42 given by ( [ eq : defm ] ) , and @xmath48 are positive dimensionless constants . we will refer to this choice as the hu & sawicki ( hereafter , hs ) model by the name of the authors who first suggested this expression .",
    "it is easy to check that all the constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] ) are easily passed by the hs model .",
    "in particular , we note that , since @xmath49 , there is no actual cosmological constant in the model , but @xmath50 so that , when @xmath51 at fixed @xmath52 , we recover an effective cosmological constant in high curvature @xmath53 environments .    another possibility to satisfy all the constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] )",
    "is offered by the starobinsky proposal @xcite : @xmath54 \\label{eq : frst}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 a scaling curvature parameter and @xmath56 two positive constants",
    ". we will refer to this class of @xmath1 theories as the starobinsky ( st ) model .",
    "note that , even in this case , @xmath49 so that no actual cosmological constant is present .",
    "nevertheless , an effective one is recovered in the high curvature regime as can be seen from @xmath57 with @xmath58 .    as a general remark",
    ", we note that the hs and st models are quite similar at both very low and very high redshifts since they are both built up by imposing the same constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , they both aim at mimicking the successful @xmath3cdm scenario in the late and early universe . put in other words , the hs and st models",
    "both reduces to the gr+@xmath3 case in the limits of very high and very low curvature .",
    "what makes them different is the way the two extreme cases are connected , i.e. how the universe evolves from the present day @xmath3 dominated phase to the early matter epoch .    for completeness",
    ", we finally remind the reader that the two models we are considering here are not the only viable ones ; other possible examples are given in @xcite .",
    "it is , moreover , possible to work out @xmath1 models which can also provide an inflationary expansion in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "however , all these other cases share many similarities with the hs and st models so that we are confident that exploring just two classes of fourth - order gravity theories should provide us with some general conclusions on their viability .",
    "any model that aims to describe the evolution of the universe must be able to reproduce what is indeed observed . matching the model with observations is also a powerful tool to constrain its parameters and allows to estimate some further quantities of interest .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the hs and st models are carefully designed to give an effective cosmological constant in the late universe . moreover ,",
    "both theories are assigned by a three parameters function , and one can anticipate that the considerable freedom allowed by the degeneracy among the parameters makes it easy to find some combinations that lead to quite similar @xmath59 in the low @xmath60 regime . fitting to sneia data can only tell us whether the models are viable over the redshift range @xmath61 .",
    "we expect that this is indeed the case because the @xmath1 functions have been tailored to do so .",
    "what is not garanteed is that the hs and st @xmath1 models can describe the background expansion up to higher redshifts @xmath60 . to probe this regime , we will use the recently derived hubble diagram of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .    in the bayesian approach to model testing",
    ", we explore the parameter space through the likelihood function : @xmath62 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & \\times & \\exp{\\left [ - \\frac{1}{2 }   \\left ( \\frac{h_{hst } - h}{\\sigma_{hst } } \\right ) ^2 \\right ] } \\label{eq : deflike}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where * p * denotes the set of model parameters . before discussing in detail the term related to the sneia and grb data , we concentrate on the two gaussian priors",
    "the former takes into account the constraints on the physical matter density @xmath63 with @xmath64 as inferred from wmap5 data @xcite .",
    "one can wonder whether such an estimate may be used as a constraint on the @xmath1 models since it has been obtained by fitting the cmbr spectrum assuming the validity of gr .",
    "however , what is really needed for this estimate to be model independent is not that gr holds along all the evolutionary history , but that the gravity lagrangian reduces to the einstein - hilbert one at the last scattering . since , for both hs and st models , @xmath65 for @xmath66 , we can safely use the wmap5 @xmath67 value as a constraint .",
    "the gaussian prior on @xmath68 in eq.([eq : deflike ] ) stems from the results of the hst project @xcite which has estimated the hubble constant @xmath69 using a well calibrated set of local distance scale .",
    "averaging over the different methods , the survey finally gives : @xmath70 as a cosmological model independent constraint in agreement with our adopted value . ] .",
    "the main two terms in the likelihood ( [ eq : deflike ] ) are both related to the hubble diagram , the first one being , in particular , connected with sneia .",
    "these latter data have provided the first piece of evidence for the cosmic speed up and are still a sort of _ ground - zero _ test that every cosmological model has to pass to be considered acceptable . to check this , one relies on the predicted distance modulus : @xmath71 } \\label{eq : defmuth}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 the dimensionless comoving distance : @xmath73 the likelihood function is then defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of sneia used , @xmath76 is a @xmath75-dimensional vector with the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the @xmath79 covariance matrix of the sneia data .",
    "note that , if we neglect the correlation induced by systematic errors theories . ] , as we do here , @xmath78 is a diagonal matrix and eq.([eq : deflikesneia ] ) simplifies to : @xmath80 } \\label{eq : likesneiasimple}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 ^ 2 } \\label{eq : defchisneia}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 the error on the observed distance modulus @xmath83 for the i - th object at redshift @xmath84 . as input data , we use the union sneia sample assembled in @xcite by reanalysing with the same pipeline both the recent sneia snls @xcite and essence @xcite samples and older nearby and high redshift @xcite datasets .",
    "although quite useful in probing the accelerated expansion , sneia are limited to @xmath85 . as a consequence",
    ", one has to resort to a different distance indicator to push the hubble diagram to higher redshift and probe the ( supposedly ) matter dominated era .",
    "thanks to the enormous energy release that makes them visibile up to @xmath86 , grbs stand out as ideal candidates to this scope .",
    "the discovery of 2d correlations between their properties have opened the way towards making grbs standard candles similarly to sneia @xcite . as a result ,",
    "schaefer @xcite have provided the first grbs hubble diagram containing 69 objects with @xmath87 estimated by averaging over 5 different 2d correlations .",
    "we use here the updated grbs hubble diagram recently presented in @xcite based on a model - independent recalibration of the same 2d correlations used by schaefer .",
    "since there is no correlation among the errors of different grbs , the likelihood function now simply reads : @xmath88 } \\label{eq : likegrbsimple}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 ^ 2 } \\label{eq : defchigrb}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 takes care of the intrinsic scatter inherited from the scatter of grbs around the 2d correlations used to derive the individual distance moduli .",
    "and yet included into the error @xmath82 provided in the union dataset . ]",
    "the @xmath1 functions for the hs and st models in eqs.([eq : frhs ] ) and ( [ eq : frst ] ) depend on three parameters , while other three parameters are needed to set the initial conditions ( [ eq : incond ] ) . by adding the grbs intrinsic scatter @xmath90",
    ", we end up with a seven dimensional parameter space to be explored . to do this efficiently",
    ", we use a markov chain monte carlo code which maximizes the likelihood ( [ eq : deflike ] ) along a chain with @xmath91 points .",
    "the constraints on the parameters are then obtained by cutting out the first @xmath92 of the chain ; we thus skip the burn - in phase and thin the chain to reduce spurious correlations .    before discussing the results",
    ", we warn the reader that , in the context of bayesian statistics , the best fit model , i.e , the set of parameters @xmath93 maximizing @xmath94 , represents the most plausible model in an occam s razor sense given the data at hand .",
    "however , in a bayesian context , the best fit parameters individually do not necessarily have to be probable , but rather they must have a high joint probability density that might occupy only a small volume of the parameter space .",
    "this situation can arise if the best fit solution does not lie in the bulk of the posterior probability distribution .",
    "such a situation may often occur when the posterior is non - symmetric in a high dimensional space so that the volume can dramatically increase with the distance from the best fit solution . in this case , the best fit solution for each parameter could easily lie outside the bulk of the individual posterior distribution for @xmath95 obtained by marginalizing over the other parameters .",
    "this is indeed what happens for our models so that we have preferred to remind the reader that this somewhat counterintuitive outcome is not a problem , but rather a common feature in statistics in multi - dimensional spaces .",
    "the hs @xmath1 functional expression depends on three dimensionless positively defined parameters .",
    "while it is reasonable to expect that @xmath96 is not a large quantity , nothing can be said a priori on the order of magnitude of @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , should both of them be very large , then eq .  ( [ eq : frhs ] ) reduces to @xmath98 so that this case provide an effective cosmological constant .",
    "in contrast , should @xmath99 be very small , we get @xmath100 thus recovering power - law corrections to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian which are known to provide accelerated expansions for @xmath101",
    ". we must therefore explore a huge range for @xmath97 ; we thus skip to logarithmic units and get constraints on @xmath102 by running the mcmc code .",
    "the best fit model turns out to be :    @xmath103    @xmath104    with a best fit grb intrinsic scatter @xmath105 .",
    "the overall quality of the fit may be seen by looking at fig.[fig : bfhsplot ] and quantified by considering the following estimators :    @xmath106    so that we can safely conclude that the hs model is in very good agreement with the data .",
    "a cautionary note is in order here concerning the @xmath107 values reported above .",
    "the mcmc code maximizes the likelihood ( [ eq : deflike ] ) which is strictly not the same as minimizing either @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , from a statistical point of view , the significance level of the above reduced @xmath107 values can not be estimated from the usual tables since these standard results do not take into account systematic errors or intrinsic scatter .",
    "as such , both @xmath110 and @xmath111 must be considered only as a useful tool to quantify the agreement with the data , but should not be overrated .",
    "the constraints on the single parameters are summarized in table i where we give the mean and median values and the @xmath112 and @xmath113 confidence limits . while the best fit solution for @xmath40 is quite close to the median values , this is not the case for @xmath114 , with the best fit solution for @xmath96 lying marginally outside the @xmath113 cl . however , according to the bayesian philosophy , one must take the constraints in table i as the final outcome of the likelihood analysis .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that setting all the parameters to their median values gives :    @xmath115    so that the quality of the fit is still not unreasonably bad .",
    ".constraints on the hs model parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath116    clearly show that the best fit st model is in very good agreement with the data as can also be appreciated by looking at fig.[fig : bfstplot ] .",
    "table ii reports mean , median and confidence ranges for the individual parameters .",
    "an important caveat is in order here for the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , the markov chain tends to drift towards negative values of @xmath96 which are a priori excluded in order the st model to pass the theoretical constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the histogram of @xmath96 values is clearly cut by this a priori assumption and , although formally mean and median values may be computed , they are not reliable .",
    "we thus give only upper limits on @xmath96 because the data are unable to constrain this model parameter .",
    "a similar problem also takes place for the intrinsic scatter @xmath90 which must be positive by definition .",
    "nevertheless , the chain drifts towards the border probably because of a degeneration with @xmath96 , with low @xmath96 preferring low scatter .",
    "we therefore only give upper limits on @xmath90 too .",
    "the comparison between table i and ii shows that the values of the three parameters @xmath40 are consistent with each other .",
    "there is actually some tension for the deceleration parameter @xmath117 with the st model favouring a greater speed up , but the good overlap of the confidence ranges makes this difference statistically irrelevant .",
    "we do not discuss the comparison with previous results in the literature but we refer to what we have said above for the hs model . as a remark , however , we note that the agreement of the parameters @xmath118 is not completely unexpected .",
    "indeed , these quantities set the initial conditions ( [ eq : incond ] ) so that this is only telling us that the auxiliary functions @xmath28 are very close to each other for @xmath119 . since",
    "both the hs and st models are designed to fit the same present day data , it is not surprising that they are quite similar today and lead to the same values of the parameters which set the initial conditions .",
    "it is , on the contrary , somewhat surprising that , notwithstanding the initial larger acceleration , the transition redshift ( estimated with the same procedure used above ) is lower than in the hs case , being :    @xmath120    @xmath121    although formally in marginal disagreement at the @xmath112 level with the results for the hs model , the two sets of constraints are however not too different . in particular",
    ", the st @xmath122 value remains in good agreement with the previous estimates in the literature .",
    "finally , even if we can not put strong constraints on @xmath123 , we briefly discuss their values .",
    "first , we note that , since the term @xmath124 quickly starts dominating over unity , at intermediate @xmath60 , we get : @xmath125 \\ .\\ ] ] let us suppose , for a moment , to drop the assumption @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath127 , the above @xmath1 is approximated by the sum of a ( negative ) cosmological constant and a quadratic @xmath128 correction modulated by the value of @xmath129 .",
    "once again , we therefore recover a lagrangian similar to the inflationary lagrangian of starobinsky , since the negative cosmological constant soon becomes subdominant .",
    "this qualitative discussion helps us understanding why the chain drifts towards negative @xmath96 which have been excluded , in order to give eq.([eq : frst ] ) the correct limit for @xmath43 . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the code is forced to look for an accelerating solution in this regime . since , again , the term @xmath124 quickly overcomes the unity , the above approximation of the st @xmath1 still holds ; we may easily note that the dominant correction is of the form @xmath130 so that the best fit @xmath131 makes the model similar to the @xmath132 proposal firstly introduced as a fourth - order gravity motivated alternative to scalar field dark energy . as a final remark",
    ", we look at fig.[fig : qzlamcont ] which shows that @xmath117 is correlated with the weighting parameter @xmath133 which here plays the same role as @xmath134 for the hs model .",
    "the impact of @xmath1 on the expansion history can be alternatively discussed by resorting to the effective dark energy equation of state ( hereafter , eos ) .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of the background evolution , @xmath1 models are equivalent to a cosmological scenario made out of dust matter and an effective dark energy term with an eos given by : @xmath135 \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & \\times & \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\omega_m ( 1 + z)^3}{e^{2}(z ) } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\ , \\label{eq : eoseff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the dark energy density parameter reads :    @xmath136 } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : omdeeff}\\ ] ]    fig.[fig : effeos ] shows the effective eos for both the hs and st models setting the parameters to their best fit values .",
    "it is impressive to see how closely the two eos are with @xmath137 being almost exactly the same for the two models for @xmath138 .",
    "note that here we have not plotted the full redshift range up to the last scattering @xmath139 to make easier to see the details at low @xmath60 .",
    "however , when @xmath140 , we have checked that @xmath137 converges to @xmath141 , i.e. the effective dark energy behaves as a matter term in the early universe and scales with the redshift in the same way .",
    "this is still an expected consequence of the constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] ) ensuring that @xmath65 for @xmath142 .",
    "in such a limit , we therefore recover a gr universe with only matter .",
    "hence , we get @xmath143 which , inserted into eq.([eq : eoseff ] ) leads to @xmath144 whatever is the @xmath1 model considered .",
    "the hs and st effective eos are different in the low @xmath60 regime .",
    "indeed , for the best fit models , we find : @xmath145 for the hs model and : @xmath146 for the st case .",
    "for both models , the present day values of @xmath147 and its redshift derivative disagree with the @xmath3cdm expected values , @xmath148 and @xmath149 . actually , we must consider the bayesian constraints obtained from evaluating these quantities along the chain . for @xmath150 , we find : @xmath151_{med } = -1.04 \\ \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath152 for the hs model , while for the st we get : @xmath153_{med } = -1.18 \\ \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath154 defining @xmath155 , we get : @xmath156 @xmath157 for the hs model , while in the st case it is : @xmath158 @xmath159 as it is apparent , an effective cosmological constant is reasonably consistent with these constraints .",
    "the present day value of the eos is indeed close to @xmath160 , while its first derivative , although being not null , is quite small and consitent with zero within the @xmath113 confidence range .",
    "however , we stress that neither the linear fit @xmath161 nor the widely used chevallier - polarski - linder @xcite ansatz @xmath162 provide a good approximation over the redshift range probed .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us look again at fig.[fig : effeos ] . for both @xmath1 theories ,",
    "the effective eos takes a positive value during the epoch of galaxy formation @xmath163 and over a wide redshift range in the matter dominated epoch .",
    "however , the effective dark energy density @xmath164 is very small during this period so that the deceleration parameter stays almost constant to @xmath165 for @xmath166 as for a matter only universe .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that the departures from @xmath141 have essentially no impact on the background when struture formation takes place .",
    "the @xmath1 functional law for both the hs and st models has been formulated in such a way to pass the constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] ) .",
    "however , this does not mean that there are no detectable deviations from the gr metric on solar system and galactic scales whatever the model parameters are .",
    "indeed , the hs and st models correctly represent two different classes of @xmath1 theories containing , as particular cases , models which are able to evade the local tests of gravity .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore whether the cosmologically selected models belong to this subclass .",
    "a key role will be played by the value of @xmath167 . by evaluating this quantity along the chain",
    ", we get : @xmath168 @xmath169 for the hs model and @xmath170 @xmath171 for the st model .    in order to see how these values compare with the constraints from the local tests of gravity @xcite , we follow @xcite who have explicitly considered the case of the hs model .",
    "they have demonstrated that , in order to be consistent with the constraints on the ppn parameter @xmath172 , one has to impose the following condition : @xmath173^{-(n + 1 ) } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : gammahs}\\ ] ] such a constraint thus depends on the value of the hs model parameters and could , in principle , be included to limit the volume of the parameter space to be explored . however , we have preferred to let the mcmc code be free of searching the full parameter space since ( [ eq : gammahs ] ) is actually a quite weak prior .",
    "indeed , for the best fit model , this reduces to @xmath174 , while the best fit value is @xmath175 so that the test is easily passed .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to impose a similar constraint to the st model . to this aim , one should first solve the field equations for a static spherically symmetric source matching the inner and outer solutions and taking care of a model for the sun mass density profile . in @xcite",
    ", it is argued that , for every @xmath1 model , the ppn parameter @xmath172 may always be expressed as , : @xmath176 with @xmath177 the total solar mass and @xmath178 with @xmath179 and @xmath180 the scalar curvature of the local metric as function of the radial coordinate @xmath181 and @xmath180 the mass density profile . in order to pass the solar system constraints , @xmath182 should be as low as possible which can be accomplished by making @xmath179 follow @xmath183 so that a chamaleon effect takes place . since the st model has been designed in such a way to develop such an effect , we are confident that the solar system constraints are fulfilled even if we can not make any quantitative estimate .    finally , let us consider the galactic scales where the following constraint @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the maximum rotation velocity of the stars , has been advocated in @xcite as a @xmath1 indepedent condition to be fulfilled in order to have no deviations of the gravitational potential from the keplerian @xmath186 profile on the galaxy scales .",
    "we remind that @xcite look for a model describing the accelerated expansion of the universe , but still require a substantial dark matter content .",
    "however , the leading term @xmath187 of the lagrangian of our best fit models induce a power law deviation from the newtonian gravitational potential which was shown to describe the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies without the need of dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that our cosmologically motivated constraints on @xmath188 are definitively larger than the upper limit @xmath189 for a milky way like galaxy .",
    "although the result of the lagrangian used by @xcite can not be directly extrapolated to the hs and st models , it is however suggestive that the violation of eq.([eq : frgalaxy ] ) is an expected outcome of the region in the parameter space preferred by the data .    rotation curves of spiral galaxies are an excellent probe of the gravitational potential so that we can rely on them to judge whether any deviation from the classical newtonian result is detected .",
    "indeed , the observed flatness of @xmath190 in the outer regions , well far away from the edge of the visible disc , clearly indicates that something unusual is taking place .",
    "if one assumes a priori that the potential remains keplerian even on these scales , the only solution is to invoke the presence of a halo made out of dark matter particles ( which have not yet directly observed ) .",
    "in contrast , one can reject the dark halo hypothesis and thus interpret the flateness problem as an evidence for deviations from the newtonian potential .",
    "should this interpretation be correct , one can try to fit the rotation curves with a modified potential coming out of the low energy limit of a @xmath1 theory , which has indeed been done with success @xcite .",
    "as such , the fact that both the cosmologically selected subclasses of the hs and st models violate the constraint ( [ eq : frgalaxy ] ) should not be considered as a serious problem . actually , giving off the dark halo in favour of a modified potential could lead to a different problem .",
    "in such a case , indeed , the matter density parameter should reduce to the baryons only one , i.e. @xmath191 in disagreement with the values in tables i and ii . a possible way out could be to invoke massive neutrinos @xcite or a dark matter component only present on cluster scales .    as a final remark ,",
    "however , it is also possible that the constraint ( [ eq : frgalaxy ] ) is overrestrictive or not valid at all .",
    "indeed , eq.([eq : frgalaxy ] ) has been obtained assuming a spherical galaxy described by an nfw @xcite profile .",
    "such a profile is motivated by numerical simulations which assumes the validity of gr and hence a newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , testing the validity of gr based on a model which yet assumes this is the case is somewhat a contradiction .",
    "moreover , the derivation in @xcite assumes that the galaxy is an isolated system , while galaxies actually reside in groups or clusters .",
    "should a long range fifth force be present , its effect must be taken into account when deriving a constraint in eq.([eq : frgalaxy ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "an analytical computation which takes care of all these details is likely to be impossible and one should resort to n - body simulations in a @xmath1 cosmological background , which are yet unavailable . because of these problems , we warn the reader against considering the violation of ( [ eq : frgalaxy ] ) by the hs and st @xmath1 models as a definitive evidence that these theories should be ruled out .",
    "as soon as the observational and conceptual problems related to the cosmological constant and other dark energy scenarios became pressing , modification of the gravity sector of einstein field equations immediately appeared as an interesting alternative explanation of the observed cosmic speed up .",
    "fourth - order gravity theories then appeared as the most immediate generalizaton of einstein gr since they just encoded all the deviations into a single analytic function @xmath1 .",
    "as the problem of acceleration was solved in this framework , a new problem came out , namely how to choose a functional expression for @xmath1 which is not only able to speed up the expansion ( there were too many actually ! ) , but also not to violate the local tests of gravity and turn off its effect in the early universe where gr indeed correctly appears to work .    from a mathematical point of view , one has to look for a @xmath1 expression satisfying the constraints ( [ eq : frconstr ] ) which is indeed what the hs and st models efficiently do , postulating that @xmath1 is given by eqs.([eq : frhs ] ) and ( [ eq : frst ] ) , respectively .",
    "our aim here was then to test whether these two well behaved models actually fit the data which suggest the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "to this end , we have considered the background evolution as probed by the hubble diagram by using both sneia and grbs to cover the redshift range @xmath192 . as a first encouraging result",
    ", it turns out that both the hs and st models are in very good agreement with the data .",
    "moreover , the predicted values of the matter density parameter @xmath24 , the hubble constant @xmath68 , the deceleration parameter @xmath117 and the transition redshift @xmath122 nicely compare with previous estimates in the literature . as a further positive outcome",
    ", the cosmologically selected subclasses of the general hs and st parameterizations easily pass the constraints on the @xmath172 ppn parameter and reduce to gr in the early universe , as can also be seen by noting that the corresponding effective eos and density parameter vanish at the redshift of the last scattering surface .",
    "some unpleasant tension with the constraints on the deviation from the newtonian potential on galaxy scales is possible , but the way these constraints are derived put serious doubts on their validity hence decreasing the significance of the problem .",
    "while this manuscript was near completion , a paper was posted on the arxiv @xcite where the authors try to constrain the hs model parameters using the union sneia sample , the hubble expansion and age data @xcite and the baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , their results may not be compared straightforwardly to ours in table i. notwithstanding the different dataset used , the main difference relies in how they reparameterize the hs model .",
    "while we have directly used @xmath193 as parameters , they prefer to use the set @xmath194 with @xmath195 the effective matter density parameter and @xmath97 estimated by : @xmath196 @xmath197 finally , they have limited a priori their exploration of the parameter space to models with @xmath198 , while we have shown here that the best fit is obtained for much larger values . in principle",
    ", we can solve the above relations to get @xmath195 for our best fit model .",
    "but this is actually not possible since such relations have been obtained assuming that @xmath199 which is not true in our case .",
    "such a condition was also imposed in order to have @xmath137 not departing too much from a cosmological constant , but we have shown here that this is an unnecessary assumption . indeed , for both the hs and st models @xmath137 is close to the @xmath3 eos over a very limited range , but nevertheless we are able to fit the data since the impact of the effective dark energy term becomes quickly subdominant during the matter dominated era no matter what its eos is .",
    "as fig.[fig : effeos ] shows , although the @xmath1 functional expression is different , both the hs and st best fit models have a very similar effective eos and hence the predicted distance modulus is almost the same .",
    "moreover , the values in tables i and ii tell us that the sneia and grbs hubble diagram is unable to put strong constraints on the model parameters .",
    "it is worth wondering how the situation can be improved . as a first attempt , one can try to extend the redshift range probed by relying on the use of the so - called distance priors @xcite which provide a useful set of distance - related quantities that summarize the information contained in the cmbr anisotropy spectrum . although widely used as observational constraints in the recent literature @xcite , it is worth stressing that they are derived by assuming a fiducial @xmath3cdm model .",
    "it is then argued that the mean and covariance matrix of the distance priors parameters do not change when the model space is enlarged , i.e. the choice of the fiducial model does not impact the estimate of the priors .",
    "moreover , one also assumes that the posterior probability from the cmbr anisotropies and galaxy power spectra is correctly described by the distance priors , i.e. no information is lost when dropping the full dataset in favour of the simplified one .",
    "while both these hypotheses have been verified for dark energy models @xcite , such an exercise has never been performed for @xmath1 theories .",
    "therefore , to be conservative , we have preferred not to use them in the present analysis .",
    "one can , however , argue that including the distance priors can narrow down the constraints on some of the model parameters , but it is likely that the degeneracy between the hs and st models is not broken .",
    "indeed , the distance priors probe the universe mainly at the last scattering redshift @xmath200 thus complementing sneia and grbs which cover the range @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the early universe , both the hs and st models converge to gr so that they are likely to be too similar to be discriminated by probing this redshift regime .",
    "major improvements in the constraints and in the possibility to discriminate not only between the hs and st models , but , more generally , among dark energy and @xmath1 theories are expected from the analysis of the growth of perturbations .",
    "indeed , even if one can tailor the @xmath1 parameters in order to closely mimic the same expansion history of a given dark energy model , the evolution of the density perturbations can be rather different @xcite .",
    "in particular , this has a strong impact on both the power spectrum and halo statistics @xcite and the weak lensing signals @xcite : it is thus possible to compare predictions with data and severely constrain the viability of @xmath1 theories .",
    "it is this combination of extended hubble diagrams ( made out of sneia and grbs ) and structure growth probes ( such as galaxies power spectrum and cosmic shear ) that will finally tell us whether the observed cosmic speed up has been the first evidence of a new fluid , as mysterious as fascinating , or of new physics in the gravity sector , as unexpected as challenging .",
