    ", the mutated dna can provide molecular markers of diagnostic utility  @xcite . among them are point mutations , involving a change in a single base pair in the dna , such as those occurring in the p53 and k - ras genes  @xcite .",
    "the detection of such point mutations is useful in screening for cancers  @xcite as well as typing the cancer in order to optimize the treatment protocol  @xcite .",
    "dna microarrays  graves , wang , `` dna chips '' , are among the analytical techniques of proven potential to this end  @xcite .",
    "the detection of somatic point mutations is hampered by the presence of an excess of wild type dna .",
    "this favors hybridization of the wild type single stranded dna ( ssdna ) with mismatched sequences resulting in false positives .",
    "a similar problem occurs in analyzing single nucleotide polymorphism of pooled samples  @xcite . in the following",
    "we present a theoretical analysis of the errors introduced by such mishybridization utilizing equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "it suggests methods of quantifying the detection of point mutations by dna chips .",
    "in particular , these methods allow to obtain the ratio of concentrations of mutated and wild type dna in the sample .",
    "this ratio is of diagnostic interest and it provides a systematic method for the minimization of false positives .",
    "the numerical calculations illustrating this approach are based on recent dna chip studies of point mutation in the k - ras gene  prix , livache .",
    "dna chips consist of a support surface carrying `` spots ''  @xcite .",
    "each spot comprises numerous oligonucleotides of identical and known sequence , `` probes '' , that are terminally anchored to the surface .",
    "the spots are placed in a checkered pattern such that each sequence is allocated a unique site .",
    "each probe hybridizes preferentially with a ssdna containing a complementary sequence referred to as `` target '' . in a typical experiment",
    "the dna microarray is immersed in a solution containing a mixture of labelled ssdna fragments of unknown sequence .",
    "the presence of a given sequence is signalled by the hybridization on the corresponding spot as monitored by correlating the strength of the label signal with the position of the spot .",
    "false positives can occur because each probe can also hybridize with a mismatched sequence . when the dna microarray is designed to investigate gene expression it is possible to optimize the probe design in order to minimize this effect  @xcite . however , the implementation of this strategy is more difficult for studies of point mutations .",
    "when studying somatic point mutations the situation is further complicated by an excess of wild type , non - mutated , dna .",
    "two observations substantiate this point .",
    "first , solid tumors are heterogenous , containing a mixture both cancerous and normal , stromal , cells .",
    "the cancer cells are a minority and the fraction of mutated dna obtained from homogenized tumor biopsy can be as small as @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the fraction is much smaller for noninvasive testing for early stage cancers using body fluids such as urine  @xcite , serum  @xcite or stool  @xcite .",
    "since the hybridization is controlled by the mass action law , the excess of wild type sequence will typically contribute to the hybridization on the spots allocated to the point mutations .",
    "accordingly , the ratio of intensities of different spots may not reflect the ratio of concentrations of dna species in the sample .",
    "this mishybridization contribution will increase with the ratio of wild type dna to mutated dna thus diminishing the efficacy of the early stage screening .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in the analysis of pooled single nucleotide polymorphism samples .",
    "this problem can be resolved by determining the contribution of the wild type dna to the signal of the mutation spots .",
    "as we shall discuss , this is possible when three conditions are fulfilled : ( i ) the hybridization is allowed to reach equilibrium .",
    "( ii ) the equilibrium hybridization isotherm , relating the hybridization fraction on the spot to the sample composition , is of the langmuir form i.e. , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fraction of surface sites that bind a reactant of concentration @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the equilibrium constant of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "this regime is expected when the surface density of probes is sufficiently low  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the sample contains an excess of ssdna as is the case when using asymmetric pcr amplification  @xcite or following digestion by lambda exonuclease  @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the fraction of correctly hybridized probes on a spot is obtainable yielding also the concentrations of mutated and wild type dna in the sample .",
    "two approaches are possible : ( a ) comparing the signals of two spots with probes that match , respectively , the wild type and mutated sequences .",
    "( b ) comparing the signals of the spot corresponding to the mutation of interest at two different temperatures , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first approach requires measurement of the saturation signal of the two spots while for the second this step may be eliminated .",
    "importantly , the experimental set up reported by fotin et al  @xcite satisfies the three conditions listed above and allows to implement the two temperature approach .",
    "our analysis is based on the hybridization isotherms of dna chips allowing for the role of two types of competitive hybridization  @xcite .",
    "competitive surface hybridization occurs when two different targets can hybridize with the same probe .",
    "competitive bulk hybridization takes place when the target can hybridize with a complementary sequence in the bulk .",
    "the second process is dominant when the samples are produced by symmetric pcr amplification .",
    "when asymmetric pcr  @xcite is used the sample contains an excess of ssdna which does not experience the effect of competitive bulk hybridization .",
    "this situation can also be obtained by digesting the product of symmetric pcr with lambda exonuclease  @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the excess of ssdna dominates the hybridization with the probes and competitive surface hybridization becomes the major source of error . in the general case",
    "the hybridization isotherm reflects the electrostatic penalty incurred because each hybridization event increases the charge of the probe layer  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on systems where these interactions are screened and the hybridization isotherm assumes the langmuir form  @xcite which facilitates quantitative analysis of the data .",
    "the use of pcr amplification renders the absolute concentrations of dna species meaningless . our analysis",
    "is thus concerned with the ratio @xmath7 of the excess concentrations of mutated ( @xmath8 ) and wild form ( @xmath9 ) of ssdna .",
    "probes at the mutation spot can hybridize with both the complementary @xmath10 targets and the mismatched wild type @xmath11 targets .",
    "the fraction of mishybridized , @xmath12 , probes is high when the @xmath11 targets are present in excess .",
    "double stranded targets are not shown.,width=377 ]    our discussion focuses on the situation following amplification by asymmetric pcr ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it concerns two spots : a mutation spot carrying @xmath13 probes and a wild type spot carrying @xmath14 probes .",
    "the sample solution comprises of a wild type ssdna fragment @xmath11 and a mutated fragment @xmath10 as well as their complementary fragments , @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the number of @xmath11 and @xmath10 fragments is however larger .",
    "we assume that all free @xmath14 and @xmath15 fragments hybridize with the free complementary @xmath11 and @xmath10 ssdna fragments .",
    "our analysis focuses on the excess of unhybridized @xmath10 and @xmath11 fragments whose concentrations are denoted respectively by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we consider the small spot limit , when the hybridization at the spot has a negligible effect on the bulk concentrations . in this limit",
    "the double stranded dna @xmath16 and @xmath17 pairs in the bulk do not affect the hybridization equilibrium at the spot .",
    "in other words , the hybridization isotherm relates @xmath8 and @xmath9 to the measured hybridization signal of a spot .",
    "the targets are actually much larger than the probes . in the k - ras studies we cite the target",
    "is comprised of 117  @xcite to 157  prix monomers ( nucleotides ) while the probes comprise of 13 - 14 monomers .",
    "as we shall discuss , this `` size asymmetry '' mostly affects the boundary of the langmuir regime .",
    "its effect on the hybridization isotherms of spots of high probe density is beyond the scope of this article . in section",
    "ii we present the necessary background on the hybridization isotherm when competitive surface hybridization is dominant . the following two section",
    "discuss respectively the two - spot and two - temperature approaches for the determination of @xmath7 .",
    "experimental considerations , the relation to existing experimental studies as well as open questions are presented in the discussion .",
    "the hybridization isotherm relates the equilibrium fraction of hybridized probes on the spot to the composition of the sample  @xcite .",
    "a simple derivation of this isotherm is possible upon equating the rates of hybridization and denaturation at the surface of the spot  @xcite . in the following we consider the isotherm obtained when competitive surface hybridization is important . in particular ,",
    "both the wild type sequence , @xmath11 , and the mutated one , @xmath10 , can hybridize at the mutated @xmath15 spot .",
    "consider a spot carrying a total of @xmath18 @xmath15-probes in a sample containing unhybridized @xmath10 and @xmath11 targets of concentrations @xmath8 and @xmath19 moles per liter respectively .",
    "the total hybridization reflects both hybridization of the perfectly matched @xmath10 targets and of the mismatched @xmath11 ones .",
    "the fractions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 hybridized probes are denoted respectively by @xmath2 and @xmath22 the rate of denaturation of mismatched @xmath21 probes is @xmath23 while the rate of hybridization of @xmath15 probes with @xmath11 targets is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the corresponding rate constants .",
    "when electrostatic interactions within the layer are strongly screened , the rate constants do not depend on the probe density and the fraction of hybridized probes . at equilibrium",
    "the two rates are equal , @xmath27 leading to@xmath28where @xmath29 is the equilibrium constant  moore .",
    "similarly , the two rates for the perfectly matched @xmath20 probes are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . their equality at equilibrium",
    ", @xmath32 @xmath31 leads to @xmath33here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the equilibrium constants of hybridization between @xmath15 probes and @xmath11 and @xmath10 targets , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding standard gibbs free energies , @xmath38 is the absolute temperature and @xmath39 is the gas constant .",
    "this kinetic derivation recovers the results of a rigorous thermodynamic analysis  @xcite with one caveat : the molar concentrations should be replaced by dimensionless activities @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the activity coefficient  @xcite . since @xmath42 as @xmath43 we will retain expressions used above noting that the @xmath44 are dimensionless having the numerical value of the molar concentrations of the @xmath45 species .",
    "the two isotherms , ( [ ii1 ] ) and ( [ ii2 ] ) , are not helpful because pcr amplification of a given sample does not allow for different labels of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 targets . since both are labeled identically , the measurement yields the total hybridization fraction @xmath46 rather than @xmath2 and @xmath47 separately .",
    "accordingly , the observed isotherm for the @xmath15 spot is @xmath48as obtained by summing ( [ ii1 ] ) and ( [ ii2 ] ) .",

    "the values of @xmath58 ( figure 2 ) for a typical situation ( table 1 ) confirm that competitive surface hybridization is important only when the competing species is present in large excess . as noted earlier ,",
    "this is the case in studies of somatic point mutations when the wild type ssdna is a majority component .",
    "the wild type ssdna then contributes to the hybridization on all the mutation spots .",
    "in contrast , the concentrations of the different mutated ssdna are much smaller . as a result their contribution to the hybridization on the @xmath15 spot , and on other mutation spots , is negligible .",
