    "sutured manifold theory has produced many stunning results in the study of dehn surgery on knots , including the solution to the property r and poenaru conjectures @xcite , the result that satellite knots have property p @xcite , and an understanding of how dehn surgery on a linking number zero knot in a link complement restricts the intersections between essential surfaces and the knot @xcite . adding a 2handle to a boundary component of genus greater than 1 is a natural generalization of dehn surgery , but sutured manifold theory has not often been exploited in this study .",
    "typically , 2handle addition has been studied using purely combinatorial techniques .",
    "for example , scharlemann and wu @xcite show that if a genus 2 or greater boundary component of a hyperbolic manifold contains a reducing slope and a boundary - reducing slope , either the slopes are disjoint or they can be isotoped into a common once - punctured torus .",
    "zhang , qiu , and li @xcite have shown that if @xmath0 is simple and if the genus of a boundary component @xmath1 is at least 2 , then any two reducing slopes on @xmath1 must intersect minimally no more than 4 times .",
    "the same authors @xcite show that if @xmath1 has genus 2 , then there is at most one separating slope which will create a boundary - reducible manifold .    using combinatorial sutured manifold theory ,",
    "the paper @xcite studied a limited form of 2-handle attachment , called `` refilling meridians of a genus 2 handlebody '' .",
    "this paper continues the project of that paper , although the sutured manifold techniques in this paper are easier ( in spirit ) and apply to a wider variety of situations . in particular , we are able to draw conclusions about 2handle additions to a genus 2 boundary component @xmath1 of a simple 3manifold @xmath0 which produce a non - simple manifold . in general",
    ", there is not much overlap between the work of this paper and earlier work on 2handle additions . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because although sutured manifold theory is a very powerful technique , it is limited by the need to place sutures on non - torus boundary components .",
    "if , in a particular situation , there were knowledge about the placement of sutures the main theorem of this paper would allow a fairly thorough study of 2handle addition along even non - separating curves .",
    "the main theorem of this paper applies to sutured manifolds with any number of boundary components of any positive genus . for the applications , we focus attention on a genus two boundary component .",
    "the advantage of such a restriction is that , without knowing much about the manifold , we can be specific about suitable sutured manifold structures .",
