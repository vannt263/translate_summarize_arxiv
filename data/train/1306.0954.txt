    "due to the advent of dedicated photometric and spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the old metal - poor components of our milky way ( mw ) galaxy , namely , the thick disk and the stellar halo , are found to be far more complex than previously thought exhibiting various degrees of substructures .",
    "the origins of the complex nature of these old structural components have been studied through observations and theoretical models as one of the central issues to unveil how the mw formed and evolved along with the evolution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "although these efforts were successful in greatly advancing our view of these old mw components , their origins remain unclear .",
    "although the mw thick disk has been known for many years , its dynamical and chemical structures are still controversial to constrain its formation mechanism .",
    "the mw thick disk was originally discovered as an extra component required to fit the stellar number density distribution over the thin disk component at distances from the disk plane greater than @xmath7 kpc @xcite .",
    "the thick disk is widely believed to have been formed at an early epoch of galaxy formation because constituent stars have older ages and lower metallicities compared to the thin disk stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the solar neighborhood , thick disk stars lag in rotational velocities behind thin disk stars by @xmath8 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "chemical abundances of the thick disk stars are known to be characterized by higher [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios than the thin disk stars @xcite , more similar to the stars in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "systematic analyses of low - resolution spectra for a large number of stars from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) have significantly advanced our view of this component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , based on the sdss / segue data , @xcite suggest that the previously known metal - poor tail ( @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath11 ) of the metallicity distribution function of the thick disk , which is called the `` metal - weak thick disk '' ( mwtd ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) , could indeed be associated with an independent stellar component . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite questioned the distinct nature of the thick disk apart from the thin disk based on the analysis of chemically defined subpopulations by carefully taking into account possible selection biases in the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "the mw stellar halo is known as another oldest remnant of the early chemodynamical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "recent large surveys such as sdss reveal that the mw stellar halo is highly structured and can not be approximated by a smooth spherical distribution of metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it became clear that the stellar halo contains a number of substructures in spatial distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of constituent stars .",
    "the most prominent example is a currently merging dwarf galaxy , sagittarius and its tidal debris ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently confirmed that the mw stellar halo is divisible into two globally overlapping stellar components , namely , the inner and outer stellar halos , based on the analysis of kinematics and metallicity for a large sample of calibration stars obtained by sdss / segue . these authors showed that the inner halo dominates at galactocentric distances @xmath12 smaller than @xmath13 kpc .",
    "it has a modestly flattened distribution of stars with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath14 .",
    "the kinematics of the stars likely belonging to the inner halo are characterized by a zero to slightly prograde mean rotational velocity with large velocity dispersions . in contrast , the outer halo was found to dominate at @xmath15 kpc and exhibit a more spherical stellar density distribution .",
    "the mean metallicity was estimated to be [ fe / h]@xmath16 , which is lower than that of the inner halo .",
    "the kinematics of the outer halo component are characterised by a larger number of extreme motions ( e.g. large prograde or retrograde orbit ) that are the outlier of the typical inner halo stars @xcite .",
    "although the definite rotational properties of the two components remain under discussion ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the proposed difference in the structural properties between the inner and outer parts of the mw halo suggests that these two components formed through different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "chemical abundances of individual metal - poor stars that constitute the thick disk and stellar halos provide unique opportunity to test theoretical models for the chemodynamical evolution of these components , particularly for the possible progenitors of these systems @xcite . it has long been known that chemical abundances of metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood are characterized by an enhancement of @xmath2 elements ( mg , si , ca , and ti ) to iron abundance ratios ( [ @xmath2/fe ] ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "this result is usually interpreted as evidence that the mw field metal - poor stars are formed out of gas enriched mainly through type ii supernovae ( sne ) of massive stars , which would yield high [ @xmath2/fe ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , observations of spasial distribution , kinematics , and metallicity for a number of mw stars suggest that the metal - poor stars in the galaxy are a mixture of apparently different stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if each of these populations has their own chemical enrichment histories , we would expect to distinguish these populations through kinematics and detailed chemical abundances of individual metal - poor stars .    in this context ,",
    "any correlation between orbital kinematics and chemical compositions is of particular interest since a star with extreme kinematics is more likely to have been accreted from an external system , which may have quite different chemical enrichment histories in their birth place .",
    "detailed chemical abundances of such stars provide us with clues for understanding properties such as star formation rates , efficiency of galactic wind , initial mass function ( imf ) , etc .",
    ", of possible building blocks of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of a high - resolution spectrograph on 8 - 10 m class telescopes , comprehensive studies on the correlation between detailed chemical abundances and kinematics of nearby halo stars have been carried out ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite reported that stars having a large apocentric distance ( @xmath17 ) tend to have lower [ @xmath2/fe ] while no correlations of abundances on other orbital parameters were identified .",
    "since sample stars with extreme outer halo kinematics were still limited , the presence or absence of the correlation remained uncertain .",
    "recently , @xcite suggest that their sample of nearby dwarf stars can be divisible into two distinct groups in terms of abundances of several @xmath2 elements , namely , the low-@xmath2 and high-@xmath2 stars .",
    "the two chemically distinct groups of stars tend to show different characteristic kinematics .",
    "@xcite further reported that these groups show different abundances in other elements such as na and zn .",
    "these studies imply that the stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h]@xmath1 can not be formed within a single well mixed gas but more likely formed in different pre - galactic clumps that have their own chemical enrichment history .",
    "it remained uncertain , however , how the presence of the chemically distinct groups of stars in the solar neighborhood is fit into the formation scenario for the thick disk and inner / outer stellar halos . a sample of stars with a wide range of kinematics and metallicities , including those characteristics of the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo components , would provide useful insights into this issue . in this paper , we investigate similarities and differences in detailed chemical abundance patterns among the kinematically selected thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo stars .",
    "this allows us to investigate whether or not the stars in these components with their overlapping metallicity range formed under the influence of a similar chemical enrichment history or not . for this purpose a sample of 97 metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 ) stars spanning a wide range of orbital parameters and [ fe / h ]",
    "are studied .",
    "in paper i , we present the abundance analysis of @xmath2-elements ( mg , si , ca and ti ) for the sample stars .",
    "we showed that in a metallicity range of @xmath18[fe / h]@xmath1 , kinematically defined thick disk stars have higher [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] with small scatter , while the inner and outer halo stars show lower average abundance ratios for these elements with larger scatter . in the present study",
    ", we further present the results for sodium , iron(fe)-peak , and neutron - capture elements for the same sample of stars and investigate possible scenarios that consistently explain the observed abundance patterns in each of the old galactic components .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we present a summary of our sample stars and their membership to the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo subsamples , that have been taken from paper i. in section [ sec : analysis ] , a brief review of the observation , which was fully described in paper i , is presented . then , determination of stellar atmospheric parameters and abundance analyses of individual elements are described . in section [ sec : results ] , we present the abundance results on the distribution in the [ x / fe]-[fe / h ] plane for each of the kinematically selected subsamples and examine the correlation between [ x / fe ] and orbital parameters . finally , section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the interpretation of the abundance differences and similarities among the three subsamples and their implications for the formation of these components .",
    "the sample of 97 dwarf and giant stars with [ fe / h]@xmath19 was selected from the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite based on their kinematics . the proper motions and distance estimates were partly updated from those in the original catalog as described in paper i. the radial velocities for the sample stars were also updated to those measured from the high - resolution spectra obtained in our observation .",
    "the orbital parameters @xmath17 ( apocentric distance ) , @xmath20 ( maximum distance from the galactic plane ) , and @xmath21 ( orbital eccentricity ) were calculated by adopting the stchel - type galactic potential in the same manner as described in @xcite .",
    "more details on the sample selection and kinematics of the sample stars are described in paper i.      based on the kinematics , we assigned the membership for the thick disk , inner halo or outer halo components to each of the sample stars as described in paper i. in short , we calculated the probabilities that each of the sample stars belongs to the thick disk ( @xmath22 ) , inner halo ( @xmath23 ) or outer halo components ( @xmath24 ) , based on their space velocities in the galactic cylindrical coordinate ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) . in this calculation , the mean velocities and dispersions for the thick disk , inner halo and outer halo components as well as a fractional contribution of each component at different @xmath20 were adopted from the values obtained by @xcite based on their analyses of sdss dr7 .",
    "then , the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo stars were defined as the stars with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "other stars with @xmath31 were classified as either the thick disk / inner halo or the inner halo / outer halo intermediate populations . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we conventionally refer to the stars classified as the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo categories as the  thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo stars/ subsamples \" , respectively . in the above definitions , 12 , 34 , and 37 stars",
    "are assigned to the thick disk , inner halo and outer halo components , respectively .",
    "the adopted criteria for the membership assignment are purely based on kinematics while metallicities for each component are not taken into account .",
    "we briefly describe its consequence in the next subsection .",
    "as shown in figure 1 of paper i. , the thick disk stars in our sample have a mean rotational velocity @xmath32 km s@xmath9 , whose orbit is confined to @xmath7 kpc above and below the galactic plane ( @xmath33 kpc ) .",
    "the inner halo stars show no rotation @xmath34 on average and exhibit larger velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , the outer halo stars show a much larger dispersion in @xmath26 and some have extreme prograde or retrograde rotation . at the same time",
    ", almost all stars with orbits that reach the distance of @xmath35 kpc from the galactic plane were classified as the outer halo stars by definition .",
    "our classification of the sample stars into the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo subsamples described above is purely based on kinematics . as a result",
    ", metallicities for each of the three subsamples may be different from those of the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo components obtained in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this subsection , we compare metallicities of our thick disk , inner halo and outer halo subsamples with the metallicity distribution functions reported in the literature for each galactic component .    the thick disk stars in our sample span a lower metallicity range than that reported for the canonical thick disk component and likely include stars with chemical and kinematical properties similar to the mwtd component .",
    "the canonical thick disk component was reported to dominate in the metallicity range @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath37 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while our thick disk subsample extends to the metallicity as low as @xmath38 . at metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath11",
    ", @xcite suggested that the independent mwtd component is required to account for the observed [ fe / h ] and @xmath26 distribution for their sample stars close to the galactic plane .",
    "they also reported that the metallicity of the mwtd component is in a range @xmath39[fe / h]@xmath40 and @xmath41 km s@xmath9 with a dispersion of @xmath42 km s@xmath9 .",
    "four of the thick disk stars in our sample with [ fe / h]@xmath40 have rotational velocities similar to the mwtd ( @xmath43 km s@xmath9 ) , where the two of the most metal - poor ones have the lowest @xmath26 values .",
    "it is unclear whether these two stars represent the lowest metallicity tail of the mwtd or interlopers from the halo component .",
    "chemical abundances other than iron for the mwtd have been investigated by several studies , in which a distinct chemical signature for this component was not clearly identified .",
    "@xcite studied elemental abundances for @xmath2 , iron - peak and neutron capture elements in the 14 candidate mwtd stars and found that their abundances are indistinguishable from halo stars with similar metallicity .",
    "@xcite studied abundances of iron and @xmath2-elements for a large sample of metal - poor stars based on the medium - resolution spectroscopic data from the radial velocity experiment .",
    "they reported that the metal - poor thick disk stars are enhanced in [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios similar to the halo stars .    in paper",
    "i , we investigate [ @xmath2/fe ] for the four stars with similar properties as the elusive mwtd as mentioned above . as a result",
    ", these stars were shown to have higher [ mg / fe ] or [ si / fe ] ratios than the inner / outer halo stars .",
    "although the number of stars in this sample is very small to extract a definite conclusion about the properties of the proposed mwtd , we later compare their chemical abundances other than @xmath2 elements with those of the typical thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo stars in our sample .",
    "our classification of inner and outer - halo stars may not be representative of the stellar halo components observed in other surveys @xcite .",
    "stars with outer halo like kinematics are classified as outer halo members regardless of their [ fe / h ] . following the same criteria , stars with inner halo kinematics",
    "are assigned to the inner halo component independently from their metallicity . as a result ,",
    "our sample of inner halo and outer halo stars both span the wide range in metallicity @xmath44[fe / h]@xmath45 .",
    "this is in contrast to the inner / outer halo division reported by @xcite , where the inner halo stars have a peak metallicity of @xmath46 while the outer halo stars have @xmath16 dex .",
    "note that some of the stars assigned to the inner - halo or the outer - halo have metallicity in agreement with these components as derived in previous works .",
    "the reason for this metallicity difference is not clear .",
    "one possible explanation is that our sample selection in the solar - neighborhood ( @xmath47 kpc ) may be biased toward / against particular metallicity among the inner halo or outer halo components . in the following ,",
    "we focus on comparing abundance ratios between kinematically defined subsamples at a given metallicity .",
    "the observations for all of the sample stars were made with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; * ? ? ? * ) mounted on the subaru telescope during 2003 to 2010 .",
    "the wavelength range of @xmath48 was covered with spectral resolution of @xmath3 for most of the sample stars , while the several sample stars ( g 64 - 12 , g 64 - 37 , bd+13 2995 , g 14 - 39 and g 20 - 15 ) were observed with @xmath49 .",
    "the data reduction including bias correction , cosmic - ray removal , flat fielding , scattered light subtraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization , was performed with standard iraf routines .",
    "details of the observational setting and their reduction procedures are described in @xcite and paper i. the equivalent widths ( ews ) of absorption lines were measured by fitting gaussian to each feature .",
    "abundance analyses are performed by using an lte code with model atmospheres of @xcite , which is widely described in @xcite and in paper i. in this subsection , we describe additional details on derivation of individual elemental abundances .",
    "we basically adopt the effective temperature ( @xmath50 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath51 ) and micro - turbulent velocity ( @xmath52 ) that were estimated and used in paper i. the @xmath50 was estimated by the color @xmath50 relation using the calibrations of @xcite for dwarfs and @xcite for giants that are based on the infrared flux method .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , adopting @xmath50 from the color results in a non - negligible slope in the iron abundances versus excitation potentials of the lines for some of the sample stars .",
    "the two stars hd 171496 and lp 751 - 19 show exceptionally large slopes ( 0.09 and 0.14 dex ev@xmath9 , respectively ) compared to the median value of @xmath53 dex ev@xmath9 for the whole sample .",
    "a possible reason for the peculiar behavior of these stars is that the @xmath54 values may be underestimated .",

    "on the other hand , we estimate @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , using the iterative algorithm to take into account the finite distance to each star ( 294 and 56 pc , respectively ) . these estimate may be affected by the uncertainty in the distance estimate as well as the uncertainty in the distribution of dust near the galactic disk . since accurate estimates of @xmath54 from interstellar lines",
    "is difficult for the spectral resolution of our data , we adopt the @xmath50 value of hd 171496 from @xcite , in which the same @xmath50-scale of @xcite was used but with a more sophisticated @xmath54 estimate based on the d line . for lp 751 - 19",

    "this may suggest that the thick disk formation timescale was sufficiently short and/or the imf in the progenitor of the thick disk was biased toward high mass stars so that nucleosynthesis products of low - mass stars ( i. e. , type ia sne ) played a minor role .",
    "second , the increase in [ mn / fe ] with [ fe / h ] for the thick disk stars indicates that some contribution of type ia sne may present , since mn is predominantly synthesized in the explosive burning of type ia sne in the metallicity typical of the thick disk stars @xcite .",
    "third , the [ eu / ba ] , [ eu / la ] , [ sm / ba ] , and [ nd / ba ] ratios for the thick disk are below the values expected for the solar system r - process components , which suggests that the s - process has contributed to the chemical enrichment of the thick disk .",
    "fourth , the lower [ eu / fe ] and [ eu / mg ] ratios in the thick disk stars than in the inner / outer halo stars further support distinct chemical enrichment histories among these components , while its interpretation depends on a currently unknown astrophysical site for eu production .",
    "finally , for most of the elements , scatter in the abundance ratios for the thick disk stars is comparable to or smaller than the observational errors , which is in contrast to that for the inner / outer halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath6 .",
    "the lack of scatter may indicate that the gas from which the thick disk has formed may have been relatively well mixed .",
    "the short timescale for the formation of the thick disk might be expected in scenarios ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) , where sufficient cold gas is supplied in the form of smooth gas accretion @xcite or multiple gaseous mergers @xcite at high redshift .",
    "scenario ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) could also be possible if a preexisting thin disk formed under the sufficiently high star formation rate so that the whole disk stars rapidly became metallicity as high as the thick disk stars . in each of the above cases , the nucleosynthesis products of type ia sne and s - process",
    "should have been rapidly mixed in the ism .",
    "consistent with previous studies , the abundances of the thick disk stars in our sample do not resemble those of the known dwarf satellite galaxies around the mw , like fornax , whose abundance is characterised by much lower [ @xmath2/fe ] and [ na / fe ] and higher [ ba / fe ] at similar [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the thick disk has been totally built through an assembly of dsphs having similar properties as surviving galactic dsphs ( e.g. scenario ( 2 ) ) .    the four thick disk stars with [ fe / h]@xmath40 in our sample , all of which have kinematic properties similar to the proposed mwtd component , have particular implication on the earliest evolution of the mw thick disk .",
    "as shown in the previous sections and in paper i. , the candidate mwtd stars show distinct abundance ratios for several elements from those of the inner / outer halo stars at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath5 . even though the abundance ratios in the candidate mwtd become almost indistinguishable from the inner / outer halos at lower metallicities , their trends with [ fe / h ] seem to smoothly follow those seen in the canonical thick disk stars ( i.e. the thick disk stars with @xmath175[fe / h]@xmath1 ) with relatively small scatter .",
    "this result implies that these candidate mwtd stars may have indeed formed within the progenitors of the thick disk , which are distinct from those of the stellar halo . in other words ,",
    "our result favors the interpretation that they are remnants of the ancient mw disk system rather than the interloper of the halo population that happened to acquire disk - like kinematics .",

    "the formation of the stellar halo is believed to have involved multiple processes .",
    "these processes are frequently classified into two mechanisms , namely , a dissipational collapse of a proto - galactic gas cloud within a very short time scale , which was introduced by a landmark study of @xcite , and dissipationless mergers of smaller stellar systems with much longer timescales , which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the existing observations of halo stars seem to favor the scenario that the inner part of the stellar halo is formed via dissipative collapse of gaseous proto - galactic fragments while the outer part has built up through dissipationless merging of small stellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite studied metallicity of the stellar halo at heliocentric distances in the range 5 - 8 kpc based on sdss _ ugriz _ photometry .",
    "they found that the metallicity distribution function can be modeled with two gaussian components with peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath182 and @xmath183 , which favors the above scenario that at least two mechanisms are responsible for building up the present day stellar halo .",
    "it was also shown that such a hybrid scenario can naturally occur in the context of galaxy formation theory under the current standard cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results show that the inner halo at relatively low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath100 ) has similar abundance ratios as the outer halo and is broadly consistent with previous abundance results for the mw dsphs .",
    "this may suggest that , in [ fe / h]@xmath100 , inner halo stars were , at least in part , assembled from progenitor systems similar to these dsphs .",
    "the presense of stars accreted from dsphs is also predected from cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of @xcite , which suggests that , although the inner halo is expected to be dominated by stars formed in situ within the proto disk and later dynamically heated up to the halo region , a small fraction of accreted populations is indeed expected . in the higher metallicity range ,",
    "the abundance ratios in the inner halo subsapmle for some elements were clearly different from those in the thick disk subsample .",
    "in particular generally larger dispersion in abundance ratios in the inner halo stars compared to those in the thick disk stars argues against the hypothesis that the inner halo component is entirely built up with a single dissipational collapse and star formation within a well - mixed gas .",
    "rather , the results favor the senario that multiple gas - rich systems that have experienced various levels of chemical evolution prior to the merging have contributed to the present day inner halo .",
    "the cosmological simulation of @xcite suggests that a certain fraction of inner halo stars are expected to form within the central region of a galaxy later heated up to halo - like orbits via mergers and such stars can be distinguished from accreted stars with their chemical abundances .",
    "stars that are likely formed in such a process can indeed frequently be found in our inner halo subsample with [ fe / h]@xmath130 , characterized as high [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ na / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios .",
    "the simulation of @xcite , suggests that the large fraction of the inner halo is populated by the stars formed in the disk system later puffed up by the dynamical heating via merging dark matter subhalos .",
    "the candidate of such population can be found in our sample stars having kinematics intermediate between the thick disk and the inner halo subsamples .",
    "these stars are found to have similar abundance as the thick disk stars inferring that a certain fraction of the halo is populated by stars originally belonging to the mw disk and later heated up while partly conserving their initial kinematics and chemical abundances .",
    "our outer halo subsample shows broadly similar abundance ratios of light elements ( @xmath177 ) with many of the mw dsphs in [ fe / h]@xmath140 , which may support the hypothesis that the outer stellar halo , where @xcite found it to be dominant in [ fe / h]@xmath100 , was assembled from stellar systems similar to the present - day low luminosity mw dsphs . on the other hand , our outer halo subsample with higher metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath130 ) shows different abundance ratios compared to the inner halo stars .",
    "our sample of more metal - rich outer halo stars is generally similar to the low-@xmath2 stars reported by @xcite in terms of abundances ( e.g. low [ na / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ) and kinematics ( e.g. extreme retrograde orbit ) , although distinction from higher-@xmath2 halo stars at a given [ fe / h ] is not as clear as that observed in their works .",
    "these results may suggest that systems that have experienced extended period of chemical evolution including type ia sne before their accretion may have contributed to relatively metal - rich outer halo stars in the solar neighborhood that have distinct abundances compared to the bulk of inner halo stars .",
    "the contribution of a certain fraction of the accreted stars is also suggested from medium resolution spectroscopic samples that include more distant halo stars @xcite .    the present study of chemical abundances in the kinematically selected sample stars",
    "provides important insights into the progenitor systems that gave rise to the present stellar halo at least in the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , the number of sample stars is too small and incomplete to quantify the fractional contribution of accretions to build up the stellar halo in the solar neighborhood .",
    "upcoming surveys such as _ gaia _ and its spectroscopic followup will provide valuable insights into the origins of halo stars by measuring accurate phase - space information and chemical abundances of a large number of stars within several kpc from the sun . besides , kinematics and chemical abundance analysis of in situ outer halo stars at galactocentric distance of several tens of kpc are important to constrain the nature of the outer stellar halo .",

    "<S> we present chemical abundance analyses of sodium , iron - peak and neutron - capture elements for 97 kinematically selected thick disk , inner halo and outer halo stars with metallicities @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 . the main aim of this study is to examine chemical similarities and differences among metal - poor stars belonging to these old galactic components as a clue to determine their early chemodynamical evolution . in our previous paper , we obtained abundances of @xmath2 elements by performing a one - dimensional lte abundance analysis based on the high - resolution ( @xmath3 ) spectra obtained with the subaru / hds . in this paper , a similar analysis </S>",
    "<S> is performed to determine abundances of an additional 17 elements . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath4 , the abundance ratios of many elements in the thick disk , inner halo , and outer halo subsamples are largely similar . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) , differences in some of the abundance ratios among the three subsamples are identified . specifically , the [ na / fe ] , [ ni / fe ] , [ cu / fe ] , and [ zn / fe ] ratios in the inner and outer halo subsamples are found to be lower than those in the thick disk subsample . a modest abundance difference between the two halo subsamples in this metallicity range </S>",
    "<S> is also seen for the [ na / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to what was observed for [ mg / fe ] in our previous paper , [ eu / fe ] ratios are more enhanced in the two halo subsamples rather than in the thick disk subsample .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed distinct chemical abundances of some elements between the thick disk and inner / outer halo subsamples with [ fe / h]@xmath6 support the hypothesis that these components formed through different mechanisms . in particular , our results favor the scenario that the inner and outer halo components formed through an assembly of multiple progenitor systems that experienced various degrees of chemical enrichments , while the thick disk formed through rapid star formation with an efficient mixing of chemical elements . the lower [ na / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] observed in stars with the outer halo kinematics may further suggest that progenitors with longer star formation timescales contributed to the build - up of the relatively metal - rich part of stellar halos . </S>"
