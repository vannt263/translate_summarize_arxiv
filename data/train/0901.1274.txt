    "the short handwritten note by einstein on the back of a greetings card sent to max born on the first of january 1954 may be taken as the conceptual framework of the present work :   _ if _ @xmath2__and _ _ @xmath3 _ _  are two solutions of the same schrdinger equation , _ _",
    "_  is another solution of the same equation equally able to represent a possible situation . if however we are dealing with a ",
    "macrosystem  and _ _ @xmath2__and _ _ @xmath3 _ _  are  narrow  respect to the macrocoordinates in the vast majority of cases _ _ @xmath5 _ _  can not be  narrow  .",
    "narrowness respect to the macrocoordinates [ _ _ i.e .",
    "macro - localization _ _ ] is a property not only independent of the principles of quantum mechanics but also incompatible with them _ _  @xcite .    as we can see since the early decades of quantum mechanics the counter - intuitive properties associated with the superposition state of macroscopic objects and the problem concerning the  classicality   of quantum macrostates were the object of an intense debate epitomized in 1935 by the celebrated  _ schrdinger cat  paradox _  eins35,schr35 .",
    "in particular , the actual feasibility of such quantum object has always been tied to the alleged infinitely short persistence of its quantum coherence , i.e. of its overwhelmingly rapid  decoherence  . in modern times the latter property , establishing a rapid merging of the quantum rules of microscopic systems into classical dynamics , has been interpreted as a consequence of the entanglement between the macroscopic quantum system with the environment @xcite . by tracing over the environmental variables in the final calculations , generally the pure quantum state decays irreversibly towards a probabilistic classical mixture @xcite .",
    "recently , the general interest for decoherence has received a renewed interest in the framework of quantum information theory where it plays a fundamental detrimental role  since it conflicts with the experimental realization of the quantum computer or of any quantum device bearing any relevant complexity @xcite . in this respect",
    "a large experimental effort has been devoted recently to the implementation of macroscopic ( i.e. many - particle ) quantum superpositions states ( mqs ) , adopting photons , atoms and electrons in superconducting devices .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the realization of the mqs involving  coherent states   of light , which exhibits interesting and elegant wigner function representations @xcite .",
    "the most notable results of this experimental effort have been reached with atoms interacting with microwave fields trapped inside a cavity @xcite or for freely propagating fields @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the long lasting efforts spent in these endeavors , in these realizations the mqs  has always proved to be so fragile that even the loss of a single particle  was found to be able to spoil any possibility of a direct observation of its quantum properties .",
    "precisely on the basis of these negative results in many scientific communities ( and also within some influential editorial teams ) grew the opinion that the  schrdinger cat   is indeed an ill defined and then avoidable concept since  it fundamentally lacks of any directly observable property @xcite .    in spite of these conclusions",
    ", very recently a new kind of mqs  involving a number of particles @xmath6 in excess of @xmath0 has been realized allowing the direct observation of entanglement between a microscopic ( micro- ) and a macroscopic ( macro- ) photonic state and showing a very high resilience to decoherence by coupling with environment @xcite .",
    "precisely , the mqs was generated by a quantum - injected optical parametric amplifier ( qi - opa ) seeded by a single - photon belonging to an epr entangled pair .",
    "we emphasize here that the reported qi - opa can be considered for the present purpose as a paradigmatic system consisting of the simplest realizable _",
    "optimal  phase - covariant _ _ _ quantum cloning machine  _ _ @xcite .",
    "indeed , precisely the process of  _ quantum cloning _  was there responsible for the transfer of the entanglement and the superposition properties of a pure single - particle qubit into a multiparticle mqs .",
    "in other words , the qi - opa  encoded optimally  into a macro - state the information associated with the input microstate , a _ seed _",
    "qubit dema98,dema05,dema05b , naga07,ricc05 . by this device , that includes an orthogonality filter ( o - filter ) for enhanced state discrimination ,",
    "the micro - macro state non - separability was successfully tested and the micro - macro violation of the bellinequalities for spin-1 excitations was attained @xcite . in view of this peculiar , striking behavior , we felt that a careful analysis  of the decoherence of this novel mqsdevice was necessary .",
    "the present approach to decoherence will be cast within the  useful framework developed in the past by wojciech h.zurekzure03 .",
    "accordingly , the systems we shall consider will be characterized according to the concepts of  _ information flow _ ,  _ pointer states _ , _",
    "einselection_. precisely , according to zurek s definition , the `` pointer states '' of any detector , or of any open quantum system , consist of a preferred basis that is selected , i.e. `` einselected '' by the characteristic detector - environment interaction . when expressed in terms of these states , the correct density matrix for the detector - system combination can be obtained by standard schrdinger equation theory without having to appeal to the von neumann s nonunitary `` reduction '' process .",
    "these privileged pointer states represent the natural behavior of the detector s `` pointer '' expressing the physical outcome of any measurement process .",
    "the present work is intended to provide a new insight in the elusive , fundamental problem of decoherence and , at last , it will provide a sensible reply to the argument expressed in the einstein letter to born .",
    "hopefully , it may also lead to a revision of several prejudices about mqs .",
    "let s summarize the content of the present paper .",
    "in section ii , we introduce the criteria adopted to characterize the resilience to decoherence of  any mqs while , in order to test the validity of our approach , these criteria are applied in section iii to the case of the `` coherent '' glauber s - state mqs .",
    "we obtain an universal function which is in agreement to the expected exponential decrease of coherence , induced by losses , peculiar of this class of states .",
    "the central point of the paper is addressed in section iv where a thourough computer analysis of the decoherence affecting the mqsgenerated by the process of _ optimal _ phase - covariant quantum cloning of a single - photon state .",
    "the applicaton of the criteria here introduced show the very high resilience to losses of this mqs .",
    "finally , by the conclusive section v the scope of the work is considered on a broader perspective involving some relevant , basic quantum mechanical issues .",
    "in this section we introduce the method we intend to adopt in order to provide a consistent investigation of the `` resilience to decoherence '' of any mqs . precisely , we introduce first the criteria , based on the concept of `` distinguishability '' between two orthogonal quantum states and the related `` degree of coherence '' of a mqs involving the same states .",
    "the parameter here introduced , the `` bures distance '' is assumed as the `` merit figure '' expressing the persistance of quantum effects when decoherence process progressively randomizes the relative phase between the two components of  the mqs . finally , we describe the model adopted to simulate the transmission of the analyzed field over a `` lossy channel '' .    * criteria for macroscopic superposition . * in order to distinguish between two different quantum states , let us introduce the definition of  distance ",

    "as we shall see later in the paper , the physical interpretation of @xmath27 is legitimate insofar as the component states of the corresponding superposition , @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be defined , at least approximately , as  _ pointer states _  or  _ einselected states _  @xcite . within the set of the eigenstates characterizing any quantum system the pointer states",
    "are defined as the ones least affected by the external noise and that are highly resilient to decoherence . in other words ,",
    "the pointer states  are  quasi classical  states which realize the minimum flow of information from ( or to ) the system to ( or from ) the environment . amongst the reasonable criteria of classicality , such as the ones based on  purity  of the macrostates or on their  predictability  , discussed by w. h. zurek in reviews of modern physics @xcite , the distinguishability criterion adopted in the present work is likely to be related to the ",

    "is assumed to represents well the decoherence process , the one that provides the flow of information from the system to the environment .",
    "as it is well known , the bs - scattering is also generally assumed to model the necessarily limited quantum efficiency of any realistic photodetector , @xmath30 @xcite",
    ". then our present interpretation may be thought of as to include conceptually the latter effect into an overall decoherence scheme involving only ideal detectors @xmath31 at the end of the measurement chain .",
    "the calculation of the output density matrix consists of the @xmath32dependent bs - scattering transformation on the input state , and of the evaluation of the partial trace ( r - trace ) of the emerging field on the reflected mode , i.e. the loss variables .",
    "the aim of the paper is to study the evolution of two macro - states @xmath16 and @xmath33 and of their superpositions @xmath34 by the size of the corresponding @xmath35 , @xmath36 as a function of the parameters @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 of the lossy channel .",
    "we start by analyzing the well known mqs generated by the glauber s coherent states brun92,raim01 . then we shall consider somewhat extensively the qi - opa solution , which is at the focus of the present analysis . at",
    "last , the comparison between the two cases will provide an insightful assessment of our results .",
    "the method introduced in the previous section for studying the resilience to decoherence of macroscopic states and their quantum superposition is here applied to the mqs  of `` coherent '' glauber s - states .",

    "the quantum superposition of these states is exclusively attributable to this very peculiar ",
    "_ comb  _ structure of the fock spectrum .",
    "this structure is indeed extremely fragile under the effect of losses since ther - trace operation must be carried out in the space of the _ non - orthogonal _ coherent - states .",

    "the loss of 1 photon , on the average , leads to the mqs  visibility value : @xmath65 , and then to the practical cancellation of any detectable interference effects involving @xmath66 .",
    "this is fully consistent with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the previous calculations generalize to the general coherent state mqs : @xmath67= @xmath68 by substituting @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",

    "note that the function @xmath73 approaches its minimum valuewith zero _ slope _ : @xmath74    as noted by gunnar bjork @xcite , a similar behavior is obtained by applying the present decoherence model to the entangled two - mode number states , i.e. the states @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 and to their superpositions , called noon states : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 , for large n @xcite .",

    "indeed , owing to linearity and to the phase - covariance of the cloning process , each basis set of macrostates lying on the equatorial plane is a quantum superposition of any other macrostate set lying on that same plane .",
