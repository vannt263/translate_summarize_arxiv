    "<S> towards the goal of extracting the continuum properties , we have studied the topological charge density correlator ( tcdc ) and the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) for the topological charge density ( @xmath0 ) in su(3 ) lattice yang - mills theory for relatively small lattice spacings including some smaller than those explored before . with the help of </S>",
    "<S> recently proposed open boundary condition , it is possible to compute observables at a smaller lattice spacing since _ trapping problem _ is absent . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the reference energy scale provided by wilson flow allows us to study their scaling behavior in contrast to previously proposed smearing techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of tcdc for different lattice spacings at a fixed hyp smearing level shows apparent scaling violations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at a particular wilson flow time @xmath1 for all the lattice spacings investigated ( except the largest one ) , the tcdc data show universal behavior within our statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum properties of tcdc are studied by investigating the small flow time behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we have also extracted the pseudoscalar glueball mass from tcdc , which appears to be insensitive to the lattice spacings ( 0.0345 fm @xmath2 0.0667 fm ) and agrees with the value extracted using anisotropic lattices , within statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have studied the localization property of @xmath0 through ipr whose continuum behavior can be probed through the small values of wilson flow time and observed the decrease of ipr with decreasing wilson flow time . a detailed study of @xmath0 under wilson flow time revealed that as wilson flow time decreases , the proximity of the regions of positive and negative charge densities of large magnitudes increases , and the charge density appears to be more delocalized resulting in the observed behavior of ipr . </S>"
