    "the decay rate of pionium ( @xmath10 bound state ) has generated much interest recently , because of the possibility of extracting from a future experiment at cern @xcite @xcite precise values of the pion scattering lengths which can , in turn , be related to the quark condensate parameter , a fundamental ingredient of chpt . in order to do so ,",
    "however , all corrections of order @xmath3 times the lowest order decay rate must be evaluated . these fall in several categories and",
    "have been the subject of several recent papers @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish between pure qed corrections and corrections which arise from the interplay of strong and qed effects .",
    "the former are associated with an expansion in @xmath3 whereas the latter contains an expansion in powers of @xmath3 and other chpt coefficients , such as scattering lengths , the pion mass difference , etc .",
    "the pure qed corrections can be subdivided in relativistic and nonrelativistic contributions .",
    "this separation of scales is used , in one form or another , in all nonrelativistic bound state calculations but is the most transparent in the effective field theory ( eft ) formalism .",
    "the eft appropriate to the study of nonrelativistic qed bound states , nrqed , was developed by caswell and lepage more than ten years ago @xcite .",
    "nrqed has since been used to calculate high order corrections to the hyperfine splitting of both muonium @xcite and positronium @xcite .",
    "using nrqed , it is easy to convince oneself that in hydrogen and positronium , the @xmath11 qed corrections are purely relativistic in nature whereas the nonrelativistic corrections start at order @xmath2 .",
    "this argument was used in @xcite to dismiss the nonrelativistic corrections \" . ] .    in this note , we want to point out that the vacuum polarization correction to the coulomb interaction ( referred to as the  vpc \" correction in the following ) is actually of order @xmath3 times a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath5 is the reduced mass of the bound state . in hydrogen and positronium , this ratio is very small ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) and the function can be taylor expanded , leading to a correction of higher order . in pionium , however , the ratio is equal to @xmath15 and the function turns out to be of order one .",
    "this means that the vpc correction represents an @xmath11 correction to the lowest order rate .",
    "we want to emphasize that the observation that the vpc correction is enhanced in atoms with large reduced mass is not new ; it is , for example , discussed in the landau and lifshitz textbook on quantum electrodynamics @xcite , in the context of energy levels .",
    "another system in which this type of correction is large is dimuonium , the @xmath9 bound state . in that system ,",
    "the ratio @xmath16 is about @xmath17 and the vpc correction is also of order @xmath3 times the lowest order decay rate .",
    "this contribution was evaluated , among several other corrections , in a recent paper by jentschura _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in this note , we use effective field theories to calculate the vpc contributions to both dimuonium and pionium .",
    "our dimuonium result , @xmath18 , agrees with @xcite our result for pionium is equal to @xmath19 , which is as large as the other corrections evaluated in @xcite @xcite .",
    "we first consider the vpc corrections to the decay rate of dimuonium .",
    "for the present calculation , the only relevant interactions of the nrqed lagrangian are _",
    "fermions  & = & \\ { i _ t + -e a_0 ) }  +   same  terms  with   & - & c_4   ^_2 ^ * ^t _ 2 -  c_5  ^_2 ^ * ^t _ 2 where @xmath20 refers to the muon field , @xmath21 refers to the antimuon field and @xmath22 is the muon mass . our sign convention for the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 differs from @xcite in order to avoid minus signs in the feynman rules . to the order of interest , we can approximate the gauge derivative @xmath25 by @xmath26 since the correction due to transverse photons are suppressed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the feynman rules of the relevant interactions are presented in fig.[1 ] .",
    "we work in coulomb gauge in which the coulomb photon propagator is simply given by @xmath27 .",
    "the vacuum correction to the coulomb propagator is also illustrated in fig.[1 ] .",
    "we consider only the vpc because it is the only interaction which contributes at order @xmath28 times a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the vacuum polarization correction to the transverse propagator can be neglected because the vertices connecting transverse photons to fermions are suppressed by at least one power of the muon mass , which translates into additional factors of @xmath3 in the bound state calculation ( the interested reader is referred to @xcite for more details on nrqed power counting rules ) .    the four - fermion operator proportional to @xmath23 leads to the decay rate of orthodimuonium ( dimuonium with no angular momentum and a total spin equal to 1 ) whereas the other four - fermi operator contributes to the decay of paradimuonium ( @xmath30 ) . in a nonrelativistic system ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is nonperturbative and must be summed up to all orders , which is equivalent to solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "we will focus on the decay rate of the ground state ( @xmath31 ) , for which the wavefunction is given by ( p ) = 8 ^1/2 ^5/2 ( p^2 + ^2 ) _ ^+ _ ^- where the @xmath32 s are the two component pauli spinors of the muon and antimuon and @xmath33 represents the typical bound state momentum ( the ground state energy is given by @xmath34 ) .    in nrqed ,",
    "bound state properties are computed in two steps .",
    "first , one fixes the nqred coefficients by matching qed and nrqed scattering amplitudes , and then one computes the bound state energy by applying time ordered perturbation theory to the nrqed vertices ( with the coulomb interaction defining the unperturbed problem ) . the decay rate is given in terms of the imaginary part of the energy by @xmath35 -2 i m ( e ) .    to illustrate the use of nrqed",
    ", we now focus on the decay rate of orthodimuonium . to simplify the following discussion",
    ", we define the operator ( ^3s_1 ) ( c_4 ) s^2where the spectroscopic notation @xmath36 is used to indicate the quantum numbers of a state annihilated by this operator . in terms of this operator , the decay rate is given by ( 1 ^ 3s_1 ) = - 2   = -4 ( r = 0 ) ^2 i m ( c_4 )  =  - m_^3 ^3 2 i m ( c_4 ) [ decay ] where a factor of 2 comes from the spin average of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath23 contains an infinite expansion in powers of @xmath3 , the lowest order contribution being found by performing the matching illustrated in fig.[2 ] .",
    "all diagrams are computed exactly at threshold ( no external momenta ) , in the center of mass frame of the particles , and a nonrelativistic normalization is used for the qed diagram ( _ i.e. _ a factor of @xmath39 is provided for each external particle ) . also , we match the amplitude matrix @xmath40 and not @xmath41 .",
    "the superscript 1 on @xmath23 indicates that this is a contribution coming from a one - loop qed diagram .",
    "the nrqed diagram is simply @xmath42 whereas the imaginary part of the qed diagram is @xmath43 . solving for the nrqed coefficient , we get ( c_4^(1))=-^2 3 m_^2 [ yaya ] which , after putting in eq.([decay ] ) gives the lowest order rate , _ 0(1 ^ 3s_1)= m _",
    "we now turn to the contribution from the vacuum polarization correction to the coulomb photon .",
    "the first thing to do is to revise the matching of @xmath44 beyond one - loop . at first",
    ", this might seem unnecessary since we are interested in @xmath45 corrections only , but we must be careful about factors of @xmath46 which might compensate for factors of @xmath3 . indeed",
    ", this situation occurs in the matching illustrated in fig.[3 ] .",
    "the result for the imaginary part of the qed diagram can be found from @xcite : 2()^2 ( 9 ( 2 ) 16 m",
    "_ m_e + 4 3 ( m _ m_e ) + 22 36 + o ( m_e m _ ) ) \\ { -2 3 ^2 m_^2 } where the term in curly brackets is simply the lowest order result and the overall factor of 2 takes into account the two permutations of the diagram .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath47 represents a correction equal to @xmath48 and should therefore be treated as an @xmath11 correction instead of an @xmath2 correction . to the precision of interest in this work",
    ", we can neglect the log term , which comes from the running of the coupling constant , and all the other terms not enhanced by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "the calculation of the nrqed one - loop scattering diagram in fig.[3 ] is straightforward : \\{- 2 3 ^2 m _ }   dv  -4 ^2 v^2(1-v^2/3 ) k^2 ( 1 - v^2 ) + 4 m_e^2  =   3 16 m _",
    "^2 \\{-2 3 ^2 m_^2 } which is seen to cancel exactly the @xmath49 term in the qed diagram .",
    "this is not a coincidence .",
    "the @xmath49 term is associated to the low energy behavior of the qed diagram , and since nrqed is designed to reproduce qed in the nonrelativistic limit , this term had to be present in the nrqed diagram .",
    "this will hold for higher order loop diagrams as well .",
    "the end result is that the coefficient @xmath50 does _ not _ receive any correction of order @xmath51 from the matching to qed .",
    "therefore , we can simply use the lowest order coefficient @xmath52 given in eq.([yaya ] ) in the bound state calculation .",
    "the bound state contribution of the vpc interaction is found by applying second order perturbation theory : _",
    "vpc(^3s_1 ) = 2",
    "n | o ( ^3 s_1 ) _ m n v_vpc | n where @xmath53 is the potential corresponding to the vacuum polarization correction to the coulomb interaction : v_vpc  =   _ 0 ^ 1 dv - 4 ^2 v^2 ( 1 - v^2/3 ) k^2(1-v^2 ) + 4 m_e^2 . for the sum over intermediate states , we must include the full coulomb green s function @xmath54 in terms of which the previous expression can be written as _",
    "vpc ( ^3s_1 ) = -8 & & & &  g(p , q ) & &   ( _ 0 ^ 1 dv - 4 ^2 v^2 ( 1 - v^2/3 ) k^2(1-v^2 ) + 4 m_e^2 ) 8 ^1/2 ^5/2 ( p - k)^2 + ^2 = 2  g(p , q )   ( _ 0 ^ 1 dv - 4 ^2 v^2 ( 1 - v^2/3 ) k^2(1-v^2 ) + 4 m_e^2 ) 8 ( p - k)^2 + ^2   _ 0 [ decay2 ] where , in the first expression , a factor of -2 comes from the relation @xmath55 im(e ) , a factor of 2 comes from the spin average , and another one comes from the two sides on which the interaction can take place .",
    "the second expression gives the correction in terms of the lowest order rate , @xmath56 .",
    "for the coulomb green s function , we use the following expression derived by schwinger @xcite : g(p , q )  =  -2 _ r p^2 + ^2 ( 2 ) ^3 ^3(q ) - 16 _ r^2 ( p^2 + ^2 ) ( p - q)^2 ( q^2 + ^2 ) - 64 ^4 r(p , q ) where the first term corresponds to no coulomb interaction in the intermediate state , the second term corresponds to one coulomb line and the third term corresponds to the the exchange of two or more coulomb photons .",
    "we will refer to these three terms as the @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 contributions , respectively . a graphical representation of eq.([decay2 ] )",
    "is presented in fig.[4 ] . an explicit expression for @xmath60 can be found in @xcite .",
    "all we need for the present work is the following integral @xcite ( d^3p d^3 q ) f(p ) r(p , q )  =  - 4 ^3 ^7  _ 0^ dp   p^2 f(p ) ( p^2 + ^2)^2 ( ( 2 ) - 5 2 + p arctan ( p ) - 1 2 ( 1 + p^2 ^2 ) + 4 ^2 p^2 + ^2 ) [ rr ] where @xmath61 is an arbitary function of the magnitude of the three - momentum @xmath62 .",
    "we now calculate the correction to the decay rate of orthodimuonium .",
    "the no coulomb correction to eq.([decay2 ] ) can be integrated analytically and is found to be e_0-c  =  2 ^3 i_0(r )   _ 0 [ noc ] where @xmath63 is a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath64 which is @xmath17 in dimuonium .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we give @xmath65 for arbitrary values of r : i_0 & = & ^2 ( -59 -1 3 r^2 + r ( 1 4 + 1 6 r^2 ) + ( -2 r + 1/r + 1/r^3 ) 3 \\ { arctan ( r ) - 2 } )  ( r < 1 ) & = & ^2 36 ( -32 + 15 )  ( r=1 ) & = & ^2 ( -59 -1 3 r^2 + r ( 1 4 + 1 6 r^2 ) - ( -2 r + 1/r + 1/r^3 ) 6 \\{ln ( + r r- ) } )  ( r > 1 ) . using eq.([noc ] ) with @xmath66 , the no coulomb contribution to the dimuonium decay rate is found to be e_0-c(dimuonium )  =  0.216 _ 0  [ nocdm ] .",
    "we have reduced the one coulomb and r term contributions of eq.([decay2 ] ) to two dimensional integrals ( using the identity ( [ rr ] ) ) which were evaluated using the adaptive monte - carlo integration routine vegas @xcite .",
    "the results are respectively e_1-c ( dimuonium )  =   0.08674 _ 0 [ ocdm ] e_r ( dimuonium )  =   0.0344 _ 0 [ rtdm ] leading to a total equal to ( sum of eqs.([noc ] ) , ( [ ocdm ] ) and ( [ rtdm ] ) ) @xmath18 .",
    "this result agrees with ref.@xcite which gives @xmath67 .",
    "notice that the lowest order decay rate of paradimuonium is also given in terms of a four - fermi interaction ( the interaction proportional to @xmath24 in the lagrangian ) so that the vpc correction is also @xmath68 where @xmath56 is now the lowest order paradimuonium decay rate .",
    "the calculation of the vpc correction to the pionium decay rate is very similar to the dimuonium calculation .",
    "this is the most apparent by using a nonrelativistic field theory reproducing chpt at low energy , which we will refer to as  nrchpt \" .",
    "the only nrchpt interactions relevant to the present calculation are the coulomb interaction ( for the charged pions ) and the four - pion vertex of the form @xmath69 ( a more detailed presentation of nrchpt and calculations of the other @xmath11 corrections will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "the matching of the four pions interaction is presented in fig.[5 ] . at threshold ,",
    "the chpt amplitude for the @xmath69 vertex is equal to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the scattering amplitude in the isospin channel @xmath72 . using a nonrelativistic normalization for the external states , we divide by a factor ( ) ^2 4 m_^0 m_^+ 4 m_^+^2 where we have set @xmath73 .",
    "as we will see below , this is possible because we are interested in the decay reate to leading order in @xmath74 ( the @xmath75 corrections will be treated in a future publication ) .",
    "the end result of the matching is that the coefficient of the nrchpt four - pion interaction is c_4-pions  =   8 3 ( a_0 ^ 0-a_0 ^ 2 ) m_^+^2 .    for the coulomb photon and the vpc interaction",
    ", we use the same feynman rules as in the dimuonium calculation . as before",
    ", the coulomb interaction must be summed up to all orders , which means that the @xmath10 state will be described by the same ground state schrdinger wavefunction as before .",
    "the lowest order rate is trivially computed by considering the nrchpt interaction sandwiched between wavefunctions :  =  1 2 ( p )  c_4 pions  g_^0 ^0(q^2 )  c_4 pions ( p ) [ lo ] where the overall factor of @xmath76 is a symmetry factor and @xmath77 is the free propagator of the @xmath78 pair , given by g_^0 ^0(q^2 ) = 1 e_0 - e_intermediate [ green ] where we have neglected the binding energy in @xmath79 ( the full expression is @xmath80 ) since it leads to a correction of order @xmath81 .",
    "the difference @xmath82 appearing in eq.([green ] ) can not be set to zero since it leads to the imaginary part of the integral and , therefore , to the first order decay rate .",
    "a trivial integration gives , for the integral eq.([lo ] ) e  =   - ( 0)^2 16 m_^0 9 ( a_0 ^ 0 - a_0 ^ 2)^2 m_^+^4 ( + i 2 ) [ res ] where @xmath83 is an ultraviolet cutoff on the @xmath84 integration which would be canceled by a counterterm in a calculation of the bound state energy @xcite . since we are only interested in the decay rate , we need only to concentrate on the imaginary part of the energy . working in first order in @xmath85 , eq.([res ] ) finally leads to a decay rate equal to the well - known result _ 0 = - 2 i m ( e ) = 16 9 ( a_0 ^ 0 - a_0 ^ 2)^2 m_^+^2  ( 0 ) ^2 .",
    "turning now to the vpc correction , we have to carry out the integral given in eq.([decay2 ] ) , using the reduced mass of pionium , @xmath86 .",
    "the no - coulomb term is clearly given by eq.([noc ] ) , with @xmath87 .",
    "we find a result equal to e_0-c ( pionium )  =  0.26677 _ 0 .",
    "[ ncp ] we have also computed the one coulomb and r term contributions to the pionium decay rate using vegas and found e_1-c ( pionium )  =   0.1193 _ 0   [ ocp ] e_r ( pionium )  =   0.04372 _ 0 . [ rtp ] our final result is the sum of eqs.([ncp ] ) , ( [ ocp ] ) and ( [ rtp ] ) : e_vpc ( pionium )  =  0.4298 _ 0 which is of the same order of magnitude as the other corrections calculated in @xcite and @xcite",
