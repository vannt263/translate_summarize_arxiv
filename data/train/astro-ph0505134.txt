    "@xcite demonstrated that some quasar absorption lines arise in intervening galaxies with the discovery of the caii h and k absorption lines from ngc 3067 in the spectrum of 3c 232 .",
    "in the subsequent decades , much progress has been made in the understanding of the physical conditions , such as abundances ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , temperatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) and kinematics ( @xcite ) , of the gas responsible for intervening low - ion / neutral - gas - rich absorption .",
    "however , an overall physical description of the structures giving rise to the absorption has been more elusive .",
    "do these absorbers select extended galaxy disks , halos , stripped gas , galactic winds , clouds condensing from ionized gas surrounding galaxies , enriched igm gas not directly associated with a specific galaxy , some combination of processes , or do they have other natures altogether ?",
    "more importantly , what does the answer to this question tell us about the _ physical nature of galaxies _ , and how the properties of galaxies _ evolve with cosmic time _ ? in this contribution we address these issues in light of the results of our recent surveys for mgii absorbers in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release ( edr ) quasar spectra and in data obtained at the 6.5 m mmt on mount hopkins , az .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental result from absorption line surveys is the determination of the incidence of absorbers .",
    "as regards mgii systems , an important early survey was @xcite .",
    "the survey of @xcite determined the incidence of systems over the interval @xmath4 for absorbers with mgii @xmath5 rest equivalent width @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite determined the incidence of `` weak '' ( @xmath7 ) systems .",
    "it is both traditional and useful to consider the incidence ( proportional to total cross section , which is the integrated product of absorber cross section and comoving number density ) of systems , @xmath8 , as it depends on @xmath2 and redshift separately .",
    "the incidence as a function of mgii @xmath5 line strength , @xmath9 , from the ss92 and crcv99 surveys are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : dndw ] .    .",
    "left : the surveys of ss92 , crcv99 and ntr05a .",
    "right : fitting the data with a sum of two exponentials . ]",
    "ss92 fitted their data equally well with a power law or an exponential , but the combined ss92 and crcv99 results suggested that @xmath9 was best described by a power law . in @xcite , we presented the results of a detailed mgii survey using the sdss edr quasar spectra . though the redshift coverage and minimum @xmath2 of this survey were similar to ss92 , it was more than an order of magnitude larger which not only provided smaller statistical errors but allowed for the measurement of systems with @xmath2 up to almost 6 .",
    "the incidence determined from this survey , also shown in figure  [ fig : dndw ] , indicates that the distribution for @xmath10  is very well fit by an exponential .",
    "power law fits drastically over predict the incidence of the strongest systems .",
    "however , extrapolating our exponential fit to the weak regime drastically under predicts the crcv99 results .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the number of clouds ( kinematic sub - components ) comprising a mgii absorber is consistent with a poissonian distribution , _ except _ for the excess of single - cloud systems , which are optically - thin in neutral hydrogen and comprise @xmath11 of `` weak '' systems .",
    "it thus appears that these single - cloud systems are indeed a distinct population .",
    "therefore , we fitted the combined @xmath2 incidence data with a sum of two exponentials , shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : dndw ] .",
    "indeed , the extrapolation of the shallow exponential accounts for @xmath12 of the expected number of weak systems consistent with the fraction of multi - cloud weak systems found by rcc02 .",
    "since the crcv99 data does not overlap with the ss92 or ntr05a data , it is a concern that the upturn below @xmath13  is due to some unknown systematic difference in the surveys .",
    "we were able address this concern with our mmt survey , which achieved greater sensitivity allowing the study of weaker lines .",
    "the incidence as a function of @xmath2 determined from the mmt survey @xcite is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : dndw2 ] .     from the edr , mmt and crcv99 surveys .",
    "right : redshift dependence of @xmath14 from the edr survey . ]    also shown is the edr and crcv99 results .",
    "one can see that the @xmath7  mmt results are quite consistent with crcv99 and significantly above the extrapolation of the exponential fit to the stronger systems . however , the slope of the exponential measured in the mmt data is steeper than that determined from the edr data due to the difference in mean redshift of the surveys : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . as can be seen in the right panels of figure  [ fig : dndw2 ] which show the edr results divided into three redshift ranges , @xmath9 steepens with decreasing redshift .",
    "the mmt results for @xmath17  are consistent with the lower - redshift edr results .",
    "multi - cloud systems span a large range of strengths , and thus velocity spreads ( since @xmath2 for saturated lines is primarily a measure of line - of - sight velocity complexity ) .",
    "insight into the nature of the stronger systems can be gained by considering how their incidence depends on redshift , and thus cosmic time .",
    "the same results on incidence presented above can be shown as a function of redshift for @xmath2 ranges as opposed to as a function of @xmath2 for a range of @xmath18 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : dndz ] for the results of the sdss edr , mmt and crcv99 studies .",
    "for ranges of @xmath2 .",
    "the horizontal bars represent the redshift - bins and the vertical bars the one - sigma uncertainty .",
    "circles are from the mmt survey , and @xmath19-symbols from crcv99 .",
    "the other points represent the edr results .",
    "also shown as the dashed lines is @xmath20 for a non - evolving population in a ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) = ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 ) cosmology , normalized to the edr ( or crcv99 in the top - left panel ) results . ]",
    "there are two notable trends apparent in figure  [ fig : dndz ] .",
    "first , @xmath20 is consistent with no evolution over a long period of cosmic time , to within strong limits , for intermediate - strength ( 0.3  @xmath26 ) systems .",
    "the redshift interval @xmath27 $ ] , for example , corresponds to 6 gyrs .",
    "there are various possible interpretations of this result : ( a ) the timescales / lifetimes governing the structures are @xmath28 gyrs ; ( b ) the creation / destruction of the structures is regulated by feedback , producing a nearly steady - state ; or ( c ) a range of formation epochs , together with evolution , conspire to keep the total absorption cross - section constant . several authors ( e.g. , ss92 ; @xcite ; cv01 ) have discussed the difficulties associated with long lifetimes from effects including evaporation , hydrodynamic and rayleigh - taylor instabilities , and cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "thus , feedback and creation / destruction balance have been favored over long - lifetimes ( see , e.g. , ntr05a ) .",
    "balanced formation / evolution without feedback seems somewhat contrived , though it should be noted that this is precisely what is predicted for the low - mass end of the halo mass function in @xmath29cdm simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , without a clear picture of the physical nature of the absorbers , it is difficult to completely eliminate any of the scenarios .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : dndz ] indicates that the total absorption cross - section for systems with @xmath30  decreases with decreasing redshift , especially at @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution is such that the rate is a function of @xmath2 , or a steepening of @xmath32 with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "this can be understood if : ( 1 ) various physically - distinct structures contribute to the incidence of mgii absorbers ; ( 2 ) their relative contributions are @xmath2-dependent ; and ( 3 ) they evolve in time at different rates .",
    "thus , determining the relative contribution of each type as a function of @xmath2 can tell us about the time evolution of each type ( and perhaps vice - versa . )",
    "individual mgii systems can be studied in more depth using high - resolution spectroscopy to uncover the line - of - sight kinematic structure of the absorption .",
    "much of these results are due to churchill and collaborators ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; cv01 ) who have reported that : ( a ) intermediate - strength ( @xmath33 ) systems consist of multiple kinematic subsystems usually containing a dominant group and weak kinematic outliers ; ( b ) such systems have multiphase ionization structures ; ( c ) disk+halo models have partial / limited success describing the absorption kinematics ; and ( d ) such systems show no correlation between gas kinematics and galaxy properties . also , direct study of galaxies associated with the absorber is possible at relatively low ( @xmath34 ) redshift .",
    "such work in the 1990s ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) found that intermediate - strength mgii absorber galaxies span a range of properties and impact parameters consistent with normal , relatively luminous ( @xmath35 ) galaxies .",
    "in addition , authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have combined imaging and galaxy spectroscopy with high - resolution spectroscopy of the absorption ( though for only a small number of systems that were exclusively nearly edge - on spirals ) , finding that extrapolated disk rotation is consistent with the absorption kinematics , though could not explain it in full .",
    "furthermore , work presented at this symposium ( e.g. , tripp 2005 ; kacprzak et al .",
    "2005 ) gave new clues to the nature of mgii absorbers .",
    "for example , the covering factor for intermediate - strength systems may be much smaller than previously thought ( @xmath36 as opposed to @xmath37 ) and absorption properties show no correlation with galaxy orientation , but _ are _ correlated with galaxy asymmetry .      until recently ,",
    "very few strong ( @xmath30 ) mgii absorbers with relatively low - redshift were known , and no `` ultra - strong '' systems with @xmath38  were known .",
    "thus , the nature of the extreme end of the @xmath2 distribution , which exhibits mostly saturated absorption over a _",
    "huge _ kinematic spread ( @xmath39 kms@xmath40 ) , has not been investigated .",
    "our surveys with the sdss data , however , have uncovered a large number of such systems at redshifts low enough for direct study .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the sightlines toward two such systems .",
    "absorption doublet with the fwhm resolution marked . left : field of 0902@xmath41372 , with @xmath42and @xmath43 .",
    "if at @xmath44 , the three galaxies have @xmath45 , @xmath46 kpc ( compact galaxy close to los ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 kpc ( disturbed companion ) ; and @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc .",
    "right : field of 1520@xmath41611 with @xmath51  and @xmath52 .",
    "if at @xmath44 , the galaxy has @xmath53 and @xmath54 kpc . ]    the 0902@xmath41372 field appears to contain an interacting group of three galaxies spanning a projected distance of @xmath55 kpc .",
    "there are other galaxies at larger impact parameters , spanning @xmath56 kpc , including a pair of interacting spirals and a large bright galaxy .",
    "these galaxies that have magnitudes which are consistent with @xmath57 if they are at the absorption redshift , suggesting that the three galaxies are part of a larger group .",
    "the apparent interaction is evidence for gas - stripping being responsible for the extreme velocity spread seen in absorption .",
    "the 1520@xmath41611 field , contrastingly , reveals a lone bright galaxy at lower impact parameter .",
    "spectroscopy of the galaxy will be necessary to test models based on superbubbles or rotating disk / halo absorption .",
    "evidence from both large statistical surveys and smaller direct - observation studies provide evidence that various physically distinct types of systems give rise to intervening mgii absorbers .",
    "single - cloud weak systems are likely associated with enriched ly@xmath58 clouds , as proposed by rcc02 , in the vicinity of galaxies .",
    "the nature of the more kinematically complex systems has been difficult to determine with confidence .",
    "it seems that disks and halo clouds do contribute , though can not explain the kinematics in full .",
    "we know that a significant fraction of the strong mgii absorbers harbor damped ly@xmath58 systems ; this has been discussed separately by rao ( 2005 ) and turnshek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at this symposium .",
    "interaction - stripped gas and superwinds may have important contributions , especially at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is intriguing that the various populations contribute to the incidence of these absorbers such that @xmath1 is described extremely well by a single exponential out to the largest @xmath2 values detected in recent large surveys .",
    "detailed study of a large , uniform , unbiased sample of systems is necessary to determine the relative contributions , which will hopefully lead to a consistent understanding of their evolution in time with the determined nature of @xmath8 .",
    "we thank members of the sdss collaboration who made the sdss a success .",
    "we acknowledge support from nsf , nasa - ltsa , and nasa - stsci on various projects to study qso absorption lines .",
    "funding for creation and distribution of the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , participating institutions , nasa , nsf , doe , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society ."
