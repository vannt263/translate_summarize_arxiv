    "the evolution of galaxy populations , subsequent to the peak of cosmic star formation at @xmath4 , has been driven by a progressive extinguishing of activity as galaxies lose or exhaust their gas .",
    "recent surveys of galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath5 ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al . 2007 )",
    "reveal the corresponding growth in stellar mass on the `` red sequence '' of quiescent galaxies .",
    "a theme which emerges from such work is the  `",
    "downsizing' trend , whereby star - formation appears to be shut off at high redshifts in the most massive galaxies , while lower - mass galaxies are `` quenched '' only at more recent epochs .",
    "evidence for downsizing is also found in cluster galaxy populations .",
    "distant clusters are deficient in faint red - sequence members , relative to local clusters , suggesting that low - mass galaxies continued to form stars well after the giant ellipticals were quenched ( e.g. de lucia et al . 2007 ; stott et al . 2007 ) .",
    "there is also evolution in the typical mass of `` post - starburst '' ( post - quenching ? ) galaxies , with more massive galaxies passing through this short - lived phase at higher redshifts than the low - mass galaxies .",
    "( tran et al . 2003 ) .",
    "an alternative to studying galaxy populations at higher redshifts is to infer the quenching history from detailed spectroscopic analyses of _ today s _ red sequence galaxies .",
    "in particular , comparison of observed metal and balmer line strengths against model predictions can yield estimates of stellar population `` age '' , weighted towards the most recent star - formation episode . until recently , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) absorption - line data were limited to fairly small samples of galaxies , and generally to giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. kuntschner et al .",
    "samples based on much larger spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. nelan et al .",
    "2005 ; bernardi et al . 2006 ; graves et al .",
    "2007 ) generally do not have sufficient s / n to measure ages for individual galaxies , except at the highest luminosities .",
    "nonetheless , these surveys do recover an _",
    "average _ trend of younger ages for galaxies with lower @xmath6 , which is the expected signature of downsizing in the low - redshift fossil record .",
    "downsizing implies that today s _ faint _ red sequence galaxies are of crucial importance to understanding the evolution of galaxy populations at @xmath7 .",
    "some early progress in measuring galaxy ages in the low - luminosity regime was made by mobasher et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and caldwell , rose & concannon ( 2003 ) . here , we present new results from a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the shapley supercluster ( @xmath8 ) using the aaomega spectrograph at the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "our study is unique in its combination of wide luminosity baseline coverage , large sample size , and high s / n maintained even at low luminosity .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] of this paper summarizes the material published as smith , lucey & hudson ( 2007a ) .",
    "section  [ sec : ages ] presents further analysis , to appear in subsequent papers ( smith , lucey & hudson , 2007b , c , in preparation ) .",
    "in april 2006 , we obtained spectra for a total of 416 galaxies in the shapley supercluster , forming a magnitude - limited ( @xmath9 ) sample from the photometric catalogue of the noao fundamental plane survey ( nfps , smith et al 2004 ) .",
    "the sample covers the central 40@xmath1040 arcmin@xmath11 region in each of the three clusters abell 3556 , abell 3558 and abell 3562 .",
    "two aaomega fibre configurations were employed , with @xmath18 hours total integration for each configuration . the spectra cover the range 37005800   at a resolution of 3.5  fwhm in the blue spectrograph , and 58007300  at 1.9  fwhm in the red arm .",
    "the median s / n for faint galaxies ( @xmath12 ) is @xmath145 per  , ( at rest - frame 44005400 ) . for galaxies with @xmath13 , the median s / n is @xmath190 per  .",
    "redshifts and velocity dispersions were measured using standard cross - correlation methods .",
    "emission line equivalent widths were measured after removing a best - fiting stellar continuum model .",
    "the lick absorption line indices ( trager et al .",
    "1998 ) , were measured on the blue - arm spectra , and converted to the lick system using resolution transformations based on model ssp spectra , to avoid smoothing the observed spectra .",
    "our stellar population analysis is restricted to supercluster members using the measured redshift , and to quiescent galaxies defined by their  emission , ew ( ) @xmath14 , yielding a sample of 232 galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : ixsigs ] shows the correlations of selected absorption line indices with velocity dispersion for this sample .",
    "note that @xmath130 galaxies have measured velocity dispersions consistent with zero and are shown at an arbitrary @xmath6 at the left of the figure .",
    "index@xmath15 slopes are fitted to the @xmath1200 galaxies with measured @xmath6 .",
    "the slopes of the index@xmath15 relations can be used to infer the scaling relations followed by the stellar population parameters ( e.g. nelan et al .",
    "2005 ; smith et al .",
    "2006 ) . for the thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) models , the derived parameters are age , total metallicity ,  and @xmath3-element abundance ratio , , estimated by comparison to predictions for simple stellar populations ( ssps ) . fitting for the slopes of nine index@xmath15 relations , in comparison to the these models ,",
    "we recover : @xmath16 the quoted errors include a ( dominant ) contribution from sytematic errors , estimated using a large set of different indices in the fitting process .",
    "the age@xmath6 scaling relation is consistent with that obtained by nelan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from similar analysis of the nfps , and implies that even if the most massive red galaxies formed at very high redshift , much of the faint red population became quiescent only at recent epochs ( @xmath17 ) . as shown in smith et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , the implied deficit of faint red galaxies as a function of redshift agrees _ quantitatively _ with the observed evolution in the red sequence luminosity function ( stott et al . 2007 ; de lucia et al . 2007 ) .",
    "to move beyond the average scaling relations , we use stellar population models to determine the values of age ,  and  which reproduce a non - degenerate set of observed indices , for each galaxy individually .",
    "the results shown here are derived from fitting to the models of thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , using indices @xmath18 , fe5015 and mgb5177 . for the _ faintest _ galaxies in the sample ( @xmath19 ) , the median formal errors are 25% in age , 0.08 dex in z / h and @xmath3/fe",
    ". some key correlations of the derived parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : agesig ] .",
    "intriguingly , we find that although age is correlated more tightly with @xmath6 than with luminosity , metallicity is better correlated with luminosity .",
    "the abundance ratio  is well - correlated with @xmath6 and also follows a tight age  relation .",
    "the latter suggests that `` younger '' galaxies formed stars over more extended periods , broadly consistent with a quenching scenario rather than formation in a single rapid burst .",
    "confidence intervals for galaxies in each of three intervals in velocity dispersion .",
    "the rest of the sample is shown in grey / yellow for reference .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction in which the median age and metallicity move with increasing mass . the heavy black line ( same in all panels )",
    "indicates the direction of the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy : movement parallel to this line generates no change in galaxy broadband colours . , title=\"fig:\",width=510 ] -2 mm    figure  [ fig : ammr ] shows the relationship between age and metallicity for three intervals in @xmath6 . as expected from the previous figure , both age and  increase with increasing @xmath6 , on average .",
    "however , at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath6 , they are anti - correlated : galaxies which are younger than average for their mass are also more metal - rich than average .",
    "the sample populates a plane ( the `` z - plane '' ) described by @xmath20 = 0.66\\pm0.04 \\log\\sigma - 0.68\\pm0.04 \\log { \\rm age }   - 0.64\\pm0.08 , $ ] with scatter @xmath10.1dex in .",
    "the coefficients are consistent with those obtained by trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a smaller sample , mostly comprising giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "our results demonstrate the continuity of this plane into the low - luminosity regime .",
    "the age coefficient in the z - plane is such that the distribution of galaxies is approximately aligned with the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy , so that the reddening effect of higher metallicity compensates for the bluer colours expected of younger populations .",
    "the tightness of the tight colour  magnitude sequence is partly a consequence of this `` conspiracy '' .",

    "metallicity anti - correlation at fixed mass is crucial to understanding the star - formation history of the galaxies prior to quenching . in smith , lucey & hudson ( 2007c , in preparation ) , we describe a simple self - enrichment model for the pre - cursors of today s red sequence galaxies , and show that the rate of metallicity growth required to fit the z - plane agrees _ quantitatively _ with the evolution observed in the metallicity  mass relation for star - forming field galaxies ( e.g. from erb et al ."
