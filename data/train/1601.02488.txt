    "intensive spectroscopy of the nucleon excitation spectrum and detailed studies of the structure of these excited states has played a pivotal role in the development of our understanding of the strong interaction .",
    "the concept of quarks that emerged through such studies led to the development of the constituent quark model  @xcite ( cqm ) in the 1980s . as a result of intense experimental and theoretical effort over the past 30 years ,",
    "it is now apparent that the structure of the states in the nucleon excitation spectrum is much more complex than what can be described in terms of models based on constituent quarks alone . at the typical energy and distance scales found within the @xmath0 states , the quark - gluon coupling is large",
    "therefore , we are confronted with the fact that quark - gluon confinement , hadron mass generation , and the dynamics that give rise to the @xmath0 spectrum , can not be understood within the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the need to understand qcd in this non - perturbative domain is a fundamental issue in nuclear physics , which the study of @xmath0 structure can help to address .",
    "such studies , in fact , represent a necessary step toward understanding how qcd in the regime of large quark - gluon couplings generates mass and how systems of confined quarks and gluons , i.e. mesons and baryons , are formed .",
    "studies of low - lying nucleon excited states using electromagnetic probes at four - momentum transfer @xmath9  gev@xmath8 have revealed that the structure of these states is a complex interplay between the internal core of three dressed quarks and an external meson - baryon cloud .",
    "@xmath0 states of different quantum numbers have significantly different relative contributions from these two components , demonstrating distinctly different manifestations of the non - perturbative strong interaction in their generation .",
    "the relative contribution of the quark core increases with @xmath7 in a gradual transition to a dominance of quark degrees of freedom for @xmath10  gev@xmath8 .",
    "this kinematics area still remains almost unexplored in exclusive reactions .",
    "studies of the @xmath7 evolution of @xmath0 structure from low to high @xmath7 offer access to the strong interaction between dressed quarks in the non - perturbative regime that is responsible for @xmath0 formation .",
    "electroproduction reactions @xmath11 provide a tool to probe the inner structure of the contributing @xmath0 resonances through the extraction of the amplitudes for the transition between the virtual photon - nucleon initial state and the excited @xmath0 state , i.e. the @xmath5 electrocoupling amplitudes , which are directly related to the @xmath0 structure .",
    "these electrocouplings can be represented by the so - called helicity amplitudes  @xcite , among which are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which describe the @xmath0 resonance electroexcitation for the two different helicity configurations of a transverse photon and the nucleon , as well as @xmath14 , which describes the @xmath0 resonance electroexcitation by longitudinal photons of zero helicity .",
    "detailed comparisons of the theoretical predictions for these amplitudes with their experimental measurements form the basis of progress toward gauging our understanding of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath5 electrocouplings is needed in order to gain access to the dynamical momentum - dependent mass and structure of the dressed quark in the non - perturbative domain where the quark - gluon coupling is large  @xcite , through mapping of the dressed quark mass function  @xcite and extractions of the quark distribution amplitudes for @xmath0 states of different quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "this is critical in exploring the nature of quark - gluon confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) in baryons .",
    "figure  [ electrocoupling ] illustrates the two contributions to the @xmath5 electrocouplings . in fig .",
    "[ electrocoupling](b ) the virtual photon interacts directly with the constituent quark , an interaction that is sensitive to the quark current and depends on the quark - mass function .",
    "however , the full meson electroproduction amplitude in fig .",
    "[ electrocoupling](a ) requires contributions to the @xmath5 vertex from both non - resonant meson electroproduction and the hadronic scattering amplitudes as shown in fig .",
    "[ electrocoupling](c ) .",
    "these contributions incorporate all possible intermediate meson - baryon states and all possible meson - baryon scattering processes that eventually result in the @xmath0 formation in the intermediate state of the reaction .",
    "these two contributions can be separated from each another using , for example , a coupled - channel reaction model  @xcite .",
    "current theoretical approaches to understand @xmath0 structure fall into two broad categories . in the first category are those that enable direct connection to the qcd lagrangian , such as lattice qcd ( lqcd ) and qcd applications of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) . in the second category",
    "are those that use models inspired by or derived from our knowledge of qcd , such as quark - hadron duality , light - front holographic qcd ( ads / qcd ) , light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) , and cqms . see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of these different approaches .",
    "it is important to realize that even those approaches that attempt to solve qcd directly can only do so approximately , and these approximations ultimately represent limitations that need careful consideration . as such ,",
    "it is imperative that whenever possible the results of these intensive and challenging calculations be compared directly to the data on resonance electrocouplings from electroproduction experiments over a broad range of @xmath7 for @xmath0 states with different quantum numbers .",
    "studies of the structure of the excited nucleon states , the so - called @xmath0 program , is one of the key cornerstones of the physics program in hall  b at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "the large acceptance spectrometer clas  @xcite , which began data taking in 1997 and was decommissioned in 2012 , was designed to measure photo- and electroproduction cross sections and polarization observables for beam energies up to 6  gev over a broad kinematic range for a host of different exclusive reaction channels .",
    "consistent determination of @xmath0 properties from different exclusive channels with different couplings and non - resonant backgrounds offers model - independent support for the findings .",
    "to date photoproduction data sets from clas and elsewhere have been used extensively to constrain coupled - channel fits and advanced single - channel models .",
    "however , data at @xmath7=0 allows us to identify @xmath0 states and determine their quantum numbers , but tell us very little about the structure of these states .",
    "it is the @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath5 electrocouplings that unravel and reveal these details .",
    "in addition , electrocoupling data are promising for studies of nucleon excited states as the ratio of resonant to non - resonant amplitudes increases with increasing @xmath7 . finally , the electroproduction data are an effective tool to confirm the existence of new @xmath0 states as the data must be described by @xmath7-independent resonance masses and hadronic decay widths .",
    "the goal of the @xmath0 program with clas is to study the spectrum of @xmath0 states and their associated structure over a broad range of distance scales through studies of the @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath5 electrocouplings . for each final state",
    "this goal is realized through two distinct phases .",
    "the first phase consists of the measurements of the cross sections and polarization observables in as fine a binning in the relevant kinematic variables @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath15 ( where @xmath15 represents the phase space of the final state hadrons ) as the data support .",
    "the second phase consists of developing advanced reaction models that completely describe the data over its full phase space in order to then extract the electrocoupling amplitudes for the dominant contributing @xmath0 states .",
    "electrocoupling amplitudes for most @xmath0 states below 1.8  gev have been extracted for the first time from analysis of clas data in the exclusive @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels for @xmath7 up to 5  gev@xmath8 , in @xmath18 for @xmath7 up to 4  gev@xmath8 , and for @xmath19 for @xmath7 up to 1.5  gev@xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ low - lying ] shows representative clas data for the @xmath20 electrocouplings for the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "studies of the electrocouplings for @xmath0 states of different quantum numbers at lower @xmath7 have revealed a very different interplay between the inner quark core and the meson - baryon cloud as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "structure studies of the low - lying @xmath0 states , e.g. @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 , have made significant progress in recent years due to the agreement of results from independent analyses of the clas @xmath1 and @xmath26 final states  @xcite .",
    "the good agreement of the extracted electrocouplings from both the @xmath1 and @xmath3 exclusive channels is non - trivial in that these channels have very different mechanisms for the non - resonant backgrounds .",
    "the agreement thus provides compelling evidence for the reliability of the results .",
    "the size of the meson - baryon dressing amplitudes are maximal for @xmath27  gev@xmath8 ( see fig .  [ low - lying ] ) . for increasing @xmath7",
    ", there is a gradual transition to the domain where the quark degrees of freedom begin to dominate , as seen by the improved description of the @xmath0 electrocouplings obtained within the dse approach , which accounts only for the quark core contributions . for @xmath10  gev@xmath8",
    ", the quark degrees of freedom are expected to fully dominate the @xmath0 states @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath5 electrocoupling studies for @xmath10  gev@xmath8 expected with the future clas12 program ( see section  [ clas12-program ] ) , the quark degrees of freedom will be probed more directly with only small contributions from the meson - baryon cloud .",
    "analysis of clas data for the @xmath3 channel has provided the only detailed structural information available regarding higher - lying @xmath0 states , e.g. @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . fig .",
    "[ high - lying ] shows a representative set of illustrative examples for @xmath33 for the @xmath28 @xcite , as well as for @xmath20 for the @xmath31 and @xmath34 for the @xmath32  @xcite . here",
    "the analysis for each @xmath0 state was carried out independently in different bins of @xmath6 across the width of the resonance for @xmath7 up to 1.5  gev@xmath8 with very good correspondence within each @xmath7 bin .",
    "note that most of the @xmath0 states with masses above 1.6  gev decay preferentially through the @xmath3 channel instead of the @xmath1 channel .    with a goal to have an independent determination of the electrocouplings for each @xmath0 state from multiple exclusive reaction channels , a natural avenue to investigate for the higher - lying @xmath0 states",
    "is the strangeness channels @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , data from the @xmath4 channels are critical to provide an independent extraction of the electrocoupling amplitudes for the higher - lying @xmath0 states .",
    "the clas program has yielded by far the most extensive and precise measurements of @xmath4 electroproduction data ever measured across the nucleon resonance region .",
    "these measurements have included the separated structure functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite , recoil polarization for @xmath35  @xcite , and beam - recoil transferred polarization for @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite . for the hyperon polarization measurements , we have taken advantage of the self - analyzing nature of the weak decay of the @xmath43 .",
    "these measurements span @xmath7 from 0.5 to 4.5  gev@xmath8 , @xmath6 from 1.6 to 3.0  gev , and the full center - of - mass angular range of the @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath4 final states , due to the creation of an @xmath45 quark pair in the intermediate state , are naturally sensitive to coupling to higher - lying @xmath46-channel resonance states at @xmath47  gev , a region where our knowledge of the @xmath0 spectrum is the most limited .",
    "note also that although the two ground - state hyperons have the same valence quark structure ( @xmath48 ) , they differ in isospin , such that intermediate @xmath0 resonances can decay strongly to @xmath35 final states , but intermediate @xmath49 states can not .",
    "because @xmath36 final states can have contributions from both @xmath0 and @xmath49 states , the hyperon final state selection constitutes an isospin filter . shown in figs .",
    "[ lam_q1_w ] and [ sig_q1_w ] is a small sample of the available data in the form of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 structure functions @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42  @xcite , illustrating its broad kinematic coverage and statistical precision .",
    "while there has been progress toward a better understanding of the low - lying @xmath0 states in the region below 1.6  gev , the vast majority of the predicted missing @xmath0 and @xmath49 states lie in the region from @xmath51  gev .",
    "to date the pdg lists only four @xmath0 states , @xmath29 , @xmath52 , @xmath32 , and @xmath53 , with known couplings to @xmath54 and no @xmath0 states are listed that couple to @xmath55  @xcite ; only a single @xmath49 state , @xmath56 , is listed with coupling strength to @xmath55 .",
    "the branching ratios to @xmath4 provided for these states are typically less than 10% with uncertainties on the order of the measured coupling . while the relevance of this core set of @xmath0 states in the @xmath57 reaction",
    "has long been considered a well - established fact , this set of states falls well short of reproducing the experimental results for @xmath58  gev .    figs .",
    "[ lam_q1_w ] and [ sig_q1_w ] include two of the more advanced single channel reaction models for the electromagnetic production of @xmath4 final states .",
    "the mx model is the isobar model from maxwell @xcite , and the rpr-2007  @xcite and rpr-2011  @xcite models are from the ghent regge plus resonance ( rpr ) framework .",
    "both the mx and rpr models were developed based on fits to the extensive and precise photoproduction data from clas and elsewhere and describe those data reasonably well .",
    "however , they utterly fail to describe the electroproduction data in any of the kinematic phase space .",
    "reliable information on @xmath4 hadronic decays from @xmath0s is not yet available due to the lack of an adequate reaction model .",
    "however , after such a model is developed , the @xmath0 electrocoupling amplitudes for states that couple to @xmath4 can be obtained from fits to the extensive existing clas @xmath4 electroproduction data over the range @xmath59  gev@xmath8 , which should be carried out independently in different bins of @xmath7 with the same @xmath4 hadronic decays , extending the available information on these @xmath0 states .",
    "the development of reaction models for the extraction of the @xmath5 electrocouplings from the @xmath4 electroproduction channels is urgently needed .",
    "it is also important to note that the @xmath1 and @xmath26 electroproduction channels represent the two dominant exclusive channels in the resonance region .",
    "the knowledge of the electroproduction mechanisms for these channels is critically important for @xmath0 studies in channels with smaller cross sections such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 production , as they can be significantly affected in leading order by coupled - channel effects produced by their hadronic interactions in the pionic channels .",
    "ultimately such effects need to be properly included in the @xmath4 reaction models .",
    "as part of the upgrade of the jlab accelerator from a maximum electron beam energy of 6  gev to a maximum energy of 12  gev , a new large acceptance spectrometer called clas12 was designed for experimental hall  b to replace the clas spectrometer .",
    "the new clas12 spectrometer  @xcite is designed for operation at beam energies up to 11  gev ( the maximum possible for delivery to hall  b ) and will operate at a nominal beam - target luminosity of @xmath60  @xmath61s@xmath62 , an order of magnitude increase over previous clas operation .",
    "this luminosity will allow for precision measurements of cross sections and polarization observables for many exclusive reaction channels for invariant energy @xmath6 up to 3  gev , the full decay product phase space , and four - momentum transfer @xmath7 up to 12  gev@xmath8 .",
    "the physics program for clas12 has focuses on measurements of the spatial and angular momentum structure of the nucleon , investigation of quark confinement and hadron excitations , and studies of the strong interaction in nuclei .",
    "the commissioning of the new clas12 spectrometer is scheduled to take place in the first part of 2017 , followed shortly thereafter by the first physics running period .",
    "the electrocoupling parameters determined for several low - lying @xmath0 states from the data involving the pionic channels for @xmath7 up to 5  gev@xmath8 have already provided valuable information . at these distance scales , the resonance structure",
    "is determined by both meson - baryon dressing and dressed quark contributions . the @xmath0 program with the new clas12 spectrometer in hall  b",
