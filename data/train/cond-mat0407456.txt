    "the phenomenon of magnetization reversal is of intense interest to the data storage and recording industries , for obvious reasons .",
    "most treatments of this phenomenon have employed the standard techniques of micromagnetic modeling : analytically or numerically solving a partial differential equation satisfied by the magnetization vector , which is valid in an averaged , coarse - grained sense , on scales large compared to the crystal lattice  @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic samples of many geometries have been studied theoretically  @xcite .    provided that a sufficiently strong reversed field is applied to a ferromagnetic sample ,",
    "the reversal of the direction of magnetization is an essentially deterministic process , which if the sample is sufficiently large ( larger than the coherence length ) will begin with the formation of a spatially localized ` nucleus ' of reversed magnetization .",
    "this nucleus will grow , eventually yielding a global reversal of the magnetization .",
    "this is in contrast to the case when the applied field is less strong than the nucleation field , in which a critical nucleus can only be formed by thermal fluctuations , though its subsequent growth may be deterministic .",
    "the two types of reversal are sometimes called field - activated and noise - activated . in  many applications , such as quantifying the likelihood of loss of stored data , it is the second phenomenon , more closely tied to statistical mechanics than to the theory of deterministic evolution equations , which is of interest .",
    "the difference between the two types of reversal is made clear by an analogy .",
    "consider an oversimplified overdamped scalar model of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1  is a bistable effective potential , the two minima of which correspond to an alignment of the magnetization with and against an applied field .",
    "as the field strengthens , this double",
    "- well potential may become sufficiently skewed that the latter of the two minima disappears , leading to a rapid fall into the remaining minimum , which corresponds to alignment with the field .",
    "this is the essence of field - activated nucleation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the field is insufficiently strong , then there will remain two minima : a  metastable one ( against the field ) and a stable one ( with the field ) .",
    "it  is clear that noise - induced nucleation is in essence a standard problem of noise - induced escape from a metastable state . of  course",
    ", a satisfactory model will need to be more sophisticated than this scalar model . even if the sample is small ( `` zero - dimensional '' ) , so that reversal takes place by a process of spatially coherent rotation of the magnetization vector , the vectorial nature of the magnetization is crucial .",
    "the process of noise - activated reversal by coherent rotation was first treated theoretically by brown  @xcite , who by adapting the kramers theory of weak - noise escape rates was able to work  out an asymptotic ( low - temperature ) expression for the reversal rate in a single - domain particle with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "his work has been extended to the case of cubic anisotropy .",
    "however , the issue of which reversal mechanisms are dominant in _ large _ ferromagnetic particles remains controversial .",
    "the simplest sort of non - zero - dimensional sample is a ferromagnetic nanowire : a  long , thin cylinder of width at  most a few tens of nanometers .",
    "the most extensive treatment of field - induced but noise - activated magnetization reversal in such a sample is that of braun  @xcite . by applying the infinite - dimensional kramers theory of langer and coleman  @xcite to a stochastically",
    "perturbed landau  lifshitz  gilbert equation governing the evolution of the magnetization vector along the nanowire , he worked  out analytically an asymptotic expression for the weak - noise reversal rate .",
    "however , his treatment assumes a _ toroidal _ sample ( with periodic boundary conditions ) , and applies only in the limit of infinite sample length . in this limit ,",
    "the nucleus of his model is a metastable field configuration of soliton type , with a simple functional form .",
    "it comprises a ` critical droplet ' of reversed magnetization bounded by a @xmath2  wall and a  @xmath3 wall ; this droplet may form with equal likelihood anywhere along the sample .",
    "his computed reversal rate is accordingly proportional to the sample length  @xmath4 .",
    "it  also contains a factor @xmath5 , where @xmath6  is the energy of formation of the droplet . like brown s asymptotic reversal rate formula ,",
    "braun s contains corrections to the arrhenius ( i.e. , exponential ) low - temperature falloff .",
    "for reasons explained below , both fall  off as  @xmath7 as  @xmath8 . a  non - arrhenius behavior of the reversal rate as  @xmath8 has been found in stochastic simulations of single - domain particles , at  least  @xcite .",
    "aharoni  @xcite has criticized braun s not including the ( nonlocal ) magnetostatic self - energy in his landau  lifshitz  gilbert hamiltonian .",
    "if the magnetization is not solenoidal ( @xmath9 ) , there will be a magnetostatic volume charge , which will generate a demagnetizing field .",
    "this term can be neglected in a planar topology  @xcite , but not in the cylindrical topology .",
    "aharoni has also criticized the assumption that the magnetization vector is constant across the cross - section of the cylindrical sample , which prevents reversal from occurring via a ` curling ' mode . however , this assumption is presumably justified in the limit of small sample width . also , by what amounts to dimensional analysis",
    ", braun has shown that in this limit the nonlocal part of the self - energy is relatively small , and the local part may be absorbed into a renormalization of crystalline anisotropy constants  @xcite . with these emendations ,",
    "braun s analysis seems to be applicable to thin cylindrical samples of at  least some materials , though of  course the assumption of a very long sample with periodic boundary conditions is unrealistic and will need to be dropped .    in this extended abstract",
    "we indicate how the analytic treatment of braun can be extended to the case of a thin cylinder with flat ends , at which open ( i.e. , neumann ) boundary conditions on the magnetization vector are appropriate .",
    "we  do this by adapting our work on reversal in a real ginzburg ",
    "landau equation perturbed by weak spatiotemporal noise  @xcite . since we do not take the @xmath10 limit , our expression for the metastable nucleus configuration is more complicated than braun s .",
    "it  involves elliptic functions  @xcite , which have long been used in the analytic modeling of periodic micromagnetic structures .",
    "( see ref .  ,   2.4 , and ref .  .",
    ") sophisticated numerical simulations at the magnetic moment level of noise - activated reversal , in a thin cylinder with flat ends , show that a droplet of reversed magnetization forms at one of the ends and spreads inward  @xcite .",
    "this reversal mode is in agreement with our analytic treatment",
    ". we  also comment on the prefactor in the low - temperature reversal rate , i.e. , the factor that multiplies @xmath11 . as  @xmath10 , it does not grow linearly in  @xmath4 , but rather tends to a constant , since the formation of a droplet of reversed magnetization away from both ends of the cylinder is energetically disfavored .",
    "we  also find that the prefactor includes no  @xmath12 factor .",
    "that  is , the rate of noise - activated magnetization reversal , if physically reasonable boundary conditions are imposed , follows an arrhenius law .",
    "the theory of noise - activated fluctuations away from a metastable state  @xcite , including escape to a stable state , was developed most significantly by kramers  @xcite .",
    "major contributions were also made by eyring , who worked on escape in multidimensional state spaces in the context of reaction - rate theory .",
    "it  should be emphasized that the kramers approach to escape rates is _ asymptotic _ : increasingly accurate in the weak - noise limit , in which escape per unit time becomes exponentially unlikely . in this limit ,",
    "the phenomenology of noise - activated escape from the domain of attraction of a metastable state involves eventual motion along an ` optimal trajectory ' that typically goes uphill from the metastable state to a saddle point , near which exit occurs . by definition , this is the escape pathway of least resistance .",
    "the escape rate is computed as the integral of the outgoing probability flux through a region on the boundary of the domain of attraction which is centered on the saddle point . the optimal trajectory picture and the associated computations become increasingly valid in the weak - noise limit .    the present author and",
    "his collaborators have extended kramers theory to the case when the system being modeled , if noise is absent , has ` nongradient ' dynamics : for example , when its order parameter  @xmath13 ( not a magnetization , in  general ) is finite - dimensional but does not evolve according to any law of the form @xmath14",
    ". this could be because the dynamics include dissipation or non - conservative forces . in the nongradient case",
    "the phenomenology of escape may be quite different from that described above .",
    "the domain of attraction of a metastable state may have an unstable limit cycle as its boundary , and the outgoing optimal trajectory may spiral into this limit cycle .",
    "this is in  fact a feature of the abovementioned coherent rotation model of brown  @xcite , which is hamiltonian but includes a damping term . in two - dimensional models in which the boundary of the domain of attraction is an unstable limit cycle , the kramers escape rate must be computed as the integral of the outgoing probability flux over the entire boundary , rather than merely over the vicinity of a saddle point ( which may not be present ) .",
    "this usually gives rise to anomalous weak - noise behavior of the kramers prefactor , i.e. , the factor that multiplies the usual exponential suppression factor in the asymptotic weak - noise escape rate .    in this section",
    "we review the extensions to kramers rate theory that we shall need in understanding and extending the results of braun  @xcite , with an emphasis on the prefactor and on the phenomenology of escape .",
    "we  shall use dimensionless units throughout .",
    "suppose a point  @xmath15 in finite - dimensional euclidean space ( or  possibly on a surface such as a sphere ) evolves according to the overdamped langevin equation @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a drift field , @xmath18  is normalized white noise , which satisfies @xmath19 and @xmath20  is a noise - strength parameter .",
    "suppose the drift field has a metastable point  @xmath21 and a stable point  @xmath22 , with a saddle point denoted  @xmath23 ( for unstable ) between them , on the common boundary of their domains of attraction . if  @xmath24 initially , the time for noise - activated escape can be defined as the time needed for @xmath15 to reach some specified region  @xmath25 that lies strictly within the domain of attraction of  @xmath22 , and contains @xmath22 itself .",
    "this escape time @xmath26 is a random variable , the distribution of which in the weak - noise limit will not be much affected by the choice of region  @xmath25 . as @xmath27 , its mean @xmath28 will grow exponentially ( to  leading order ) , and its distribution will increasingly resemble that of an exponential random variable .",
    "the escape rate @xmath29 can be defined as the reciprocal @xmath30 .",
    "just as there is noise - activated motion from @xmath21 to  @xmath22 , there is noise - activated motion from @xmath22 back to  @xmath21 , but reverse motion is exponentially suppressed in the weak - noise limit , relatively as  well as absolutely .",
    "the escape rate @xmath29 may be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32  is the minimum amount of energy the noise must put into the system to drive it over the saddle  @xmath23 . by definition ,",
    "the second factor is the kramers factor , and @xmath33  is the kramers prefactor .",
    "the case when the drift field  @xmath17 is the negative gradient of a potential function , i.e. , @xmath34 , is the easiest case to treat , since the optimal escape trajectory is simply a time - reversed relaxational trajectory , and satisfies @xmath35 .",
    "it turns  out that @xmath36 ( the factor of  @xmath37 is sometimes absorbed into a redefinition of  @xmath38 ) .",
    "the weak - noise behavior of the escape rate can readily be expressed in  terms of linear approximations to the drift field at @xmath24 and  @xmath39 , by the kramers  eyring formula . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "this formula is @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the eigenvalue of the linearized negative drift field at  @xmath21 whose corresponding eigenvector points along @xmath42 , the direction locally parallel to the departing optimal trajectory .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 is the eigenvalue of the linearized negative drift field at  @xmath23 whose corresponding eigenvector points along  @xmath44 , the direction locally perpendicular to the approaching optimal trajectory , and so forth .",
    "@xmath45  is the eigenvalue of the linearized negative drift field at  @xmath23 that corresponds to the unstable , or ` downhill ' direction ; it is negative .",
    "the formula  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) generalizes immediately to the case when the order parameter @xmath15  has arbitrary finite dimensionality  @xmath46 . in  general",
    ", the prefactor will contain a product of @xmath47 factors resembling @xmath48 , one for each direction transverse to the optimal trajectory .",
    "the standard formula  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) contains a constant prefactor , which does not include any power of the noise strength  @xmath38 .",
    "but the derivation of  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) makes clear how such a power could arise .",
    "the _ stationary _ probability density function  ( pdf ) of the order parameter  @xmath15 is @xmath49 , up  to normalization .",
    "the slowest decaying nonstationary mode of the drift - diffusion equation for the pdf is a _ quasistationary _",
    "pdf  @xmath50 , which characterizes how probability equilibrates between the domains of attraction of @xmath21 and  @xmath22 . like  @xmath51",
    ", it will contain an @xmath52 factor , so it will typically be concentrated on the @xmath53 transverse lengthscale near the saddle point  @xmath23 .",
    "but unlike  @xmath51 , @xmath50  will have opposite signs in the two domains . along the @xmath54 direction through  @xmath23",
    ", it will change sign .",
    "the rate @xmath29 is the rate at which probability diffuses across the saddle , from @xmath21 toward  @xmath22 .",
    "as kramers showed , this is easily evaluated as an integral of the probability flux . in this",
    "integral there are several powers of  @xmath38 that must be kept track  of .",
    "for example , there is a normalization factor proportional to  @xmath55 in @xmath50 ( as  there is in  @xmath51 ) .",
    "also , it follows from the langevin equation  ( [ eq : langevin ] ) that besides drifting along  @xmath17 , the pdf diffuses with diffusivity  @xmath38 . a  careful evaluation of the probability flux integral yields the kramers prefactor shown in  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) , with all powers of  @xmath38 canceling .",
    "a prefactor containing a nontrivial power of  @xmath38 could arise from the potential energy  @xmath56 behaving non - quadratically near @xmath57 or  @xmath23 , causing one or more of the four eigenvalues appearing in  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) to equal zero  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , non - arrhenius behavior will also arise in the case of a two - dimensional order parameter if the separatrix between the domains of attraction of @xmath21 and  @xmath22 contains no  saddle point , and is an unstable limit cycle . for this to be the case , the drift  @xmath17 can not be the negative gradient of a potential function .",
    "a  transverse integration of the probability flux generated by the quasistationary pdf  @xmath50 over an @xmath58 lengthscale around a limit cycle , rather than over an @xmath53 transverse lengthscale near a saddle point , will yield an escape rate larger by a factor roughly proportional to  @xmath59 . in  such a situation , @xmath60 where",
    "` @xmath61 ' can be evaluated as an integral around the separatrix , will replace  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) .",
    "all of the preceding remarks apply to the case of finite - dimensional _ overdamped _ dynamics , where the langevin equation for the order parameter has the form  ( [ eq : langevin ] ) .",
    "if  there is damping but the strength of the damping is not taken to infinity , a more appropriate langevin equation in dimensionless units is @xmath62 where @xmath63  is a damping constant , or equivalently @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "this is effectively an overdamped langevin equation for a @xmath66-dimensional order parameter  @xmath67 that diffuses only in the velocity direction .",
    "but if @xmath68  has some fixed positive value , the weak - noise behavior of the kramers prefactor in this non - overdamped model is surprisingly similar to that discussed above .",
    "the prefactor becomes @xmath68-dependent  @xcite , but there is still no @xmath38-dependence if @xmath34 with @xmath69  quadratic near @xmath21 and  @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath70 , an @xmath71 factor will appear in the kramers prefactor if @xmath72  is not derived from a potential and there is no  saddle on the separatrix , for essentially the reason already discussed .",
    "there are clearly some subtleties associated with the reduction of the non - overdamped model of  ( [ eq : nonoverdamped ] ) to the overdamped model of  ( [ eq : langevin ] ) when  @xmath73 , but we do not discuss them here .",
    "infinite - dimensional kramers theory is a theory of rate and relaxation phenomena exhibited by random fields , rather than by randomly evolving finite - dimensional order parameters .",
    "however , it is formally quite similar to finite - dimensional kramers theory .",
    "this is perhaps not entirely clear from standard expositions  @xcite , but we shall make it  so",
    ". for simplicity , consider a field @xmath74 perturbed by noise of strength  @xmath38 , which evolves with overdamped dynamics on a spatial domain  @xmath75 $ ] according to @xmath76 the first term on the right - hand side is the functional derivative of an energy functional , and @xmath77  is normalized _ spatiotemporal _ white noise , which satisfies @xmath78 i.e. , has a flat power spectrum in space as  well as time .",
    "typically @xmath79 = \\int_0^l \\left [ \\frac{\\phi'(x)^2}2 + v\\left(\\phi(x)\\right ) \\right]\\,dx,\\ ] ] so that the evolution equation is a stochastically perturbed ginzburg ",
    "landau equation , namely @xmath80 if the potential  @xmath69 is bistable or multistable then noise - induced transitions between stable spatially extended states , each of which is concentrated around a field value that is a minimum of  @xmath69 , may occasionally take place .",
    "each such transition will involve a passage through an intermediate ( unstable ) saddle state .",
    "these spatially extended states are strongly affected by the boundary conditions at @xmath81 and  @xmath82 .",
    "suppose that @xmath83 has two local minima , at @xmath84 , with the latter being the global minimizer ; and that the intervening local maximum is at  @xmath85 .",
    "if  periodic or neumann boundary conditions are imposed , one would expect that the metastable , saddle , and stable states are the constant field configurations @xmath86 ; though if ( say ) dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed , one would expect them to differ , especially near @xmath81 and  @xmath82 .",
    "actually , even in the periodic and neumann cases the saddle state most relevant to noise - induced transitions may not be the constant solution  @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath4  is sufficiently large , there may be a lower - energy saddle in the field configuration space , which is spatially oscillatory rather than constant  @xcite .",
    "the importance of such nonconstant saddle configurations was first pointed  out by langer  @xcite in a study of the @xmath10 limit of escape from a metastable state . due to their oscillatory character",
    "they are sometimes called `` langer s bounces '' .",
    "each such oscillatory saddle configuration can be viewed as a background metastable ( @xmath88 ) state , within which a droplet of the stable ( @xmath89 ) state has formed .",
    "the droplet is critical , which means that if pushed in the right direction , the saddle configuration may roll ` downhill ' to the stable rather than the original metastable state .",
    "the kramers  eyring formula  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) generalizes readily to the infinite - dimensional case , becoming @xmath90 here @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the eigenvalues of the linearizations of the negative drift field @xmath93 at the metastable state @xmath94 and the dominant saddle @xmath95 , arranged in increasing order .",
    "the only negative eigenvalue in either set is  @xmath96 , which corresponds to ` downhill ' motion away from the saddle .",
    "it  is easy to see that in the two - dimensional case , ( [ eq : infdem ] )  reduces to  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) .    because the numerator and denominator of the quotient inside the square root are products of an infinite number of eigenvalues , which tend to infinity as  @xmath97 , each diverges",
    "however , their quotient can be defined as a limit of finite - dimensional truncations .",
    "usually it is recast as a _ determinant quotient _ , computed from the linearized deterministic evolution operators at @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "consider for example a small perturbation  @xmath99 away from the metastable state , i.e. , @xmath100 . then to leading order @xmath101\\xi$ ] , where @xmath102\\equiv\\delta^2{\\cal h}/\\delta\\phi^2[\\phi_s]$ ] specifies the linearized zero - noise dynamics near  @xmath103 .",

    "if the boundary conditions at @xmath108 are periodic , so that the spatial domain  @xmath75 $ ] is effectively a circle , and the dominant ( lowest - energy ) saddle state @xmath95 is not the constant solution @xmath87 but rather a field configuration containing a critical droplet , the asymptotic formula  ( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) must be modified .",
    "since the droplet configuration can be shifted arbitrarily around  @xmath75 $ ] , the operator @xmath104 $ ] will have a zero eigenvalue  @xmath109 , the accompanying eigenfunction being a goldstone mode that expresses translation invariance .",
    "so in this case the prefactor of  ( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) will diverge , signalling a change in the phenomenology of escape . in  the infinite - dimensional space of field configurations",
    ", the separatrix between the domains of attraction of the metastable and stable states will now include an _ unstable limit cycle _ of length  @xmath4 , and noise - activated escape may take place anywhere along  it .",
    "we  have already explained how to handle such separatrices .",
    "since the escape rate must be computed by integrating the outgoing probability flux around the separatrix , rather than on a transverse lengthscale of magnitude  @xmath53 , the prefactor will be larger by a factor that grows like  @xmath110 as  @xmath10 .",
    "the asymptotic weak - noise behavior of the escape rate in this case , when @xmath4  is fixed , is accordingly of the form @xmath111",

    "this will tend to a limiting value as  @xmath10 , since the droplet tends to a limiting shape .",
    "we  stress that the asymptotic linear growth of the prefactor with  @xmath4 in this case occurs for a simple physical reason : if  periodic boundary conditions are imposed , the critical droplet may form with equal likelihood anywhere in the spatial domain . departures from linearity will occur when @xmath4  is small , but they are due  to the droplet assuming its limiting shape only in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "the large-@xmath4 behavior of the prefactor displayed in  ( [ eq : novel ] ) is well - known , but the finite - volume case of fixed  @xmath4 has only recently been systematically treated  @xcite .",
    "we can now relate the low - temperature micromagnetic reversal rate theories of brown  @xcite and braun  @xcite to finite - dimensional and infinite - dimensional kramers theory , respectively , and explain the physical origin of the @xmath12 prefactor that modifies each of their arrhenius laws .",
    "our discussion will indicate how braun s treatment of a very long ( @xmath10 ) ferromagnetic nanowire can be modified and extended to the case of a thin ferromagnetic cylinder with flat ends , and fixed length  @xmath4 .",

    "it  can be shown that the optimal trajectory for noise - activated escape is , in  fact , a time - reversed infalling spiral .",
    "so the mechanism of activated magnetization reversal in this model is of the sort discussed in section  [ sec : kramers ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that when @xmath146 , the metastable state becomes unstable , and there is no separatrix to be crossed .",

    "the weak - noise reversal rate will be given by  ( [ eq : needed ] ) , i.e. , @xmath149 the factor ` @xmath61 ' can be calculated by integrating along the limit cycle the rate at which the probability density of  @xmath113 is absorbed .",
    "however , this derivation already makes it clear why the nel  brown reversal rate , as it is now called , falls  off in the limit of low temperature in a non - arrhenius way .",
    "the anomalous power @xmath71 , i.e. ,  @xmath12 , arises from the need to integrate a probability flux around the entire limit cycle , rather than over an @xmath53 transverse lengthscale near a saddle point , as is more typical in the kramers theory of noise - activated escape .",
    "this derivation can be extended to the case of a single - domain ferromagnetic particle with mildly non - uniaxial anisotropy tensor  @xmath127 , in which , as here , the barrier to reversal is an unstable limit cycle .",
    "we now turn to the thin nanowire computations of braun . in their full generality , they apply to a thin nanowire of a ferromagnetic material with cubic anisotropy , the easy axis of which is aligned with the axis of the wire ; which may be taken to be the @xmath122-axis . by",
    "adding an appropriate multiple of the identity matrix to  @xmath127 ( which has no physical effect , since @xmath114 at all points in the sample ) , and rotating the coordinate system about the wire , @xmath127  can be taken to equal @xmath150 for some @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath152-axis will be a hard axis , and the @xmath122@xmath153  plane an easy plane , within which the magnetization vector at every point along the wire is preferentially confined .",
    "a  hard axis of this sort could arise from a shape anisotropy rather than a crystalline anisotropy , e.g. , from the cross section of the wire being elliptical rather than circular .    for simplicity",
    "we consider here only the limiting case @xmath154 , in which all fluctuational motion of the magnetization vector out of the @xmath122@xmath153  plane is suppressed .",

    ", they will be those for which the magnetization inclination angle  @xmath136 as a function of distance  @xmath122 along the wire satisfies @xmath158 for the moment , suppose that the wire can be viewed in some sense as toroidal , i.e. , suppose that periodic boundary conditions @xmath159 , @xmath160 can be imposed",
    ". then the solutions of  ( [ eq : eulerlagrange ] ) will include @xmath161 and  @xmath162 , which are the familiar states of metastable and stable magnetization , with the magnetization pointing against or along the external field , which is itself applied parallel to the wire .",
    "the solution @xmath163 is also stationary in  time , though unstable .",
    "this is the _ uniform _ ( nel  brown ) barrier to magnetization reversal , which in this context is a saddle point in the infinite - dimensional space of field configurations .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is sufficiently large , there will also be a _ nonuniform _",
    "barrier to magnetization reversal . by proceeding as in our analysis  @xcite of the ginzburg ",
    "landau equation  ( [ eq : gl ] ) , one can show that @xmath164 where @xmath165 depend on @xmath4 and @xmath166 , and @xmath167  is arbitrary , is also an unstable stationary solution , and is at lower energy than the nel  brown barrier . here",
    "@xmath168 is the jacobi elliptic function with modular parameter @xmath169 , the period of which is  @xmath170 , where @xmath171  is the first elliptic integral  @xcite .",
    "the parameter  @xmath172 is of  course chosen so that  @xmath173 , as a function of  @xmath122 , has period  @xmath4 . if  such a lower - energy barrier to reversal exists , its ` height ' in  terms of energy , which may be written as  @xmath174 , will determine the exponential falloff of the rate of escape from the metastable state @xmath161 , as the noise strength tends to zero .    at this point , we have gone significantly beyond the analysis of braun .",
    "it  is not difficult to check that the solution @xmath175 can be viewed as a critical droplet : for many choices of parameter , it  resembles a droplet of the @xmath141 phase inserted into a background consisting of the @xmath139 phase , and delimited by a @xmath2  wall and a @xmath3  wall .",
    "however , its shape depends on the length  @xmath4 of the wire . as  @xmath10 , it tends to a limiting shape , which may be expressed in  terms of hyperbolic trigonometric functions .",
    "this is possible because as  @xmath10 , the modular parameter  @xmath172 tends to unity , and @xmath176 degenerates to  @xmath177 .",

    "similar expressions for periodic micromagnetic structures , involving elliptic functions , have been derived in other contexts  @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately from the discussion in section  [ sec : kramers ] that for this model of a thin cylindrical particle of length  @xmath4 with periodic boundary conditions , the magnetization reversal rate  @xmath178 satisfies @xmath179 c(l)\\,\\sim\\,{\\rm const}\\times l,&\\quad l\\to\\infty\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath59 is due  to the fact that the separatrix between the metastable and stable domains of attraction contains a limit cycle of length  @xmath4 , since the droplet may be formed anywhere along the wire , on account of translation invariance .",
    "( @xmath167  above is arbitrary . )",
    "this is also responsible for the asymptotic linear growth of the prefactor with  @xmath4 .",
    "these two features were noted by braun , but we now see they have a simple physical origin .    the present approach , in which the shape of the critical droplet for fixed  @xmath4 is precisely specified in  terms of elliptic functions , yields precise values for the exponent @xmath180 and the prefactor  @xmath181 .",
    "details of the calculations , which are numerical rather than analytic , may appear elsewhere .",
    "what is of greater interest , however , is the modification of this analysis to include more realistic boundary conditions .",
    "braun has pointed  out that in a cylinder of finite length , ` open ' boundary conditions with the magnetization perpendicular to the ends may be appropriate  @xcite . in  the present scheme",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath182 , i.e. , to _",
    "neumann _ boundary conditions .    equipped with",
    "neumann boundary conditions , the euler  lagrange equation  ( [ eq : eulerlagrange ] ) still has the metastable and stable states @xmath161 , @xmath162 as solutions .",
    "a  detailed analysis , which will be published elsewhere , reveals that by choosing parameters appropriately , the unstable elliptic solution @xmath175 of  ( [ eq : newelliptic ] ) can also be made to satisfy neumann boundary conditions .",
    "however , when this is done , it becomes a ` half - droplet ' delimited by a @xmath2  wall and either @xmath81 or  @xmath82 . unlike the case of periodic boundary conditions , nucleation at low temperatures",
    "is therefore not likely to take place anywhere along the wire , but must , on energetic grounds , preferentially begin at either end .",
    "once a critical half - droplet has formed near either end , it may roll ` downhill ' in the magnetization configuration space by spreading along the wire , replacing the original value @xmath139 by @xmath141 as it goes .",
    "the important point is that if neumann rather than periodic boundary conditions are imposed , there will be no infinite degeneracy of the transition state , no  unstable limit cycle , no  non - arrhenius o(@xmath71 ) behavior of the kramers prefactor , and also no asymptotic linear dependence of the prefactor on  @xmath4 as  @xmath10 .",
    "the noise - activated magnetization reversal of a long thin ferromagnetic cylinder actually fits much better into traditional kramers theory if neumann boundary conditions are imposed .",
