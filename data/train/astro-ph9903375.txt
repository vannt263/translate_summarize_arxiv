    "the hard x - ray structure of the galactic center region is quite unusual as well as those of the other wavelengths . in particular",
    ", thin thermal hot plasma prevails all over the region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has several surprising natures .",
    "first , the temperature is quite high , about 10  kev .",
    "second , the total energy is also high , about @xmath2 erg .",
    "third , the plasma wide - spreads in the region bigger than 1@xmath31 , which corresponds to about 150pc@xmath3150pc for the distance of the galactic center .",
    "fourth , the spectrum of the plasma is surprisingly uniform from field to field except for the slight change of the surface brightness .",
    "the origin of the plasma is still an enigma .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are one of the possible candidates for the origin of the hot plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the other candidates ; the past activity of the central massive black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) , unresolved many cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the global magnetic activity which heats the interstellar matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the snrs explain all the hot plasma , first , the total energy ( @xmath4 erg ) requires about 10@xmath5 supernovae in the narrow region with the scale of a few hundred pc in the last 510@xmath6 years , which is the age of the plasma ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would lead to the much higher supernova rate than the common rate of a few supernovae in a century in all the galaxy .",
    "however , the possible starburst activity in the galactic center region has been often discussed . in particular ,",
    "recent _ comptel _ observations of 1.8  mev line suggest that 10@xmath7 supernovae occurred in the last 410@xmath8 years ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is consistent with the required supernova rate .",
    "second , the supernova origin hypothesis requires the mean temperature of about 10 kev .",
    "it is much higher than the usual temperature of snrs ( @xmath9 a few kev ) .",
    "however , if snrs densely exist in the region , the temperature may heat up to about 10 kev by the mutual interaction of the shocks .",
    "thus , snrs are still one of the candidates for the origin of the galactic center plasma .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the x - ray natures of the snrs in the galactic center region from the observational point of view .",
    "the capability of imaging spectroscopy with 0.510 kev ( @xcite ) is quite suitable for the study .",
    "in fact , owing to the hard x - ray sensitivity of , particularly above 2  kev , we can possibly detect new snrs which have been hidden by the heavy interstellar absorption , hence obtain some information whether the snrs are valid for the origin of the galactic center plasma .",
    "using all the available pointing observations in this region ( @xmath01@xmath101 , @xmath01@xmath111 ) and a part of the data of the ongoing galactic center survey , we studied the x - ray emission from the known snrs ( @xcite ) , and searched new snrs .",
    "we assume the distance to the galactic center to be 8.5 kpc .",
    "we searched x - ray emission from the cataloged snrs ( @xcite ) , and then investigated each nature where significant x - ray emission is detected .",
    "[ fig:359.1 - 0.5 ] ( upper panel ) shows the gis image of g359.1@xmath00.5 with 1.62.1 kev band .",
    "we detected center - filled x - rays from this source , whereas the radio image shows a clear shell - like structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum is found to have emission lines from highly ionized ion ( fig .  [ fig:359.1 - 0.5 ] ( lower panel ) ) , hence the x - rays come from thin thermal plasma .",
    "the most distinct two lines are k@xmath12 lines from helium - like silicon and hydrogen - like sulfur . they imply that the plasma has multi - temperature structure .",
    "the absorption column density is estimated at @xmath13 , suggesting that g359.1@xmath00.5 is located at near the galactic center , which is consistent with the radio observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this column density is larger by a factor of 2 or 3 than that with the measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are still confident of our estimation because the energy band is the most suitable for measuring such heavy absorption .",
    "details of the analysis are given in yokogawa ( 1999 ) .",
    "[ fig : img:0.9 + 0.1 ] ( upper panel ) shows the gis image of g0.9@xmath10.1 with 310 kev band .",
    "we detected significant x - ray emission from this source in this hard energy band , whereas no significant x - ray is detected in the softer energy band .",
    "the x - ray emitting region is compact and not resolved with gis .",
    "the radio size of the source is 2 in diameter ( @xcite ) , hence it is consistent with the x - ray image .",
    "the spectrum is found to be hard ; @xmath142 kev ( the best - fit of 40 kev ) in thermal model or @xmath151.5 in power - law model , with heavy absorption of @xmath16 , although the statistics are not good .",
    "this hardness may imply the emission to be non - thermal origin .",
    "the flux is 210@xmath17 in 210 kev band .",
    "it is consistent with the upper limit by ( @xcite ) , but significantly lower than the result ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : img:359.1 + 0.9 ] ( upper panel ) shows the gis image around g359.1@xmath10.9 .",
    "x - ray emission from the position corresponding to g359.1@xmath10.9 is detected with the significance of 9.8@xmath18 in 0.73 kev band ( ax  j1739.6@xmath02911 in fig .",
    "[ fig : img:359.1 + 0.9 ] ) , whereas the significance in 310 kev band is 2.1@xmath18 .",
    "faint extended emission around ax  j1739.6@xmath02911 also can be seen in the 0.73 kev band image .",
    "we made the radial profile with the center at the peak of ax  j1739.6@xmath02911 and fitted it with the model of the point spread function ( psf ) and the background ( nxb@xmath1cxb(cosmic x - ray background ) ) where the normalizations of the psf and the background were allowed to be free .",
    "the model is found to be rejected with the confidence of 97.4% , _",
    "i.e. _ , the slightly extended emission with the radius of 4@xmath195 was marginally detected with the significance of 2.2@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img:359.1 + 0.9 ] lower panel ) .",
    "the size is consistent with the radius of the radio shell , @xmath205 .",
    "the spectrum of the central region of ax  j1739.6@xmath02911 is found to be well fitted with the thin thermal plasma model with @xmath210.7 kev ( @xmath22/d.o.f.@xmath232.67/5 ) and @xmath24 , although the statistics are not good .",
    "the flux is 310@xmath25 in total energy band , converted to the luminosity of 210@xmath26 if we assume the distance to be 8.5 kpc .",
    "note that the soft spectrum with no absorption may imply that this source is not located in the galactic center region , but is a foreground source , hence the above estimated luminosity may be reduced by several factors or more .",
    "the extended emission with positional coincidence with the radio structure strongly supports that it is an x - ray counter part of the snr , if the detection of the extended emission is true .",
    "the soft spectrum also supports it",
    ". the luminosity may be rather low for an snr .",
    "however , plane survey has failed to detect many radio snrs , suggesting their quite dim x - ray luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the low x - ray luminosity of this source may be acceptable for an snr",
    ". future observations with high sensitivity will be encouraged .      for the other cataloged snrs ( g359.0@xmath00.9 , sgr a east ( g0.0@xmath10.0 ) , g0.3@xmath10.0 , sgr d snr ( g1.0@xmath00.1 ) )",
    ", we detected no significant x - ray emission associated with the snrs .",
    "it is possibly because no strong x - ray is actually emitted .",
    "however we should be conservative for no x - ray emission from those sources because the detected positions of those snrs are heavily contaminated from nearby strong x - ray sources ; slx  1744@xmath0299/300 near g359.0@xmath00.9 , sgr  a and ax  j1745.6@xmath02901 near sgr  a east , 1e  1743.1@xmath02843 near g0.3@xmath10.0 , and gx3@xmath11 near g1.0@xmath00.1 .",
    "we discovered two new candidates of snrs . in this section ,",
    "we report the preliminary results on them .",
    "[ fig:0.0 - 1.3 ] ( upper panel ) shows the gis image of g0.0@xmath01.3 ( ax  j1751@xmath029.6 ) in 0.73 kev band .",
    "we discovered the clearly extended emission with the scale of about 40@xmath310 .",
    "the spectrum is found to have the emission lines from highly ionized ions , hence is the thermal origin ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0.0 - 1.3 ] lower panel ) .",
    "in fact , the spectrum is well fitted with a thin thermal plasma model with @xmath27 kev and @xmath2810@xmath29 .",
    "the x - ray flux is @xmath30 in 0.53 kev band .",
    "the column density suggests that this source may be in front of the galactic center region according to sakano ( 1999 ) , and be located at the distance of about 4  kpc if we assume the mean interstellar density of 1 h  @xmath31 .",
    "then , the obtained flux is converted to the luminosity of 3@xmath32 under the assumption of the distance of 4  kpc . even in the case of the quite small distance of 1  kpc ,",
    "the luminosity is larger than @xmath33 .",
    "we now consider the classification of the source .",
    "the clearly extended emission of the thin thermal plasma with @xmath210.5 kev implies that this source is an snr or a star forming region .",
    "the luminosity is also within the typical range of snrs but much higher than that of a star forming region .",
    "therefore , ax  j1751@xmath029.6 is a strong candidate for a new snr .",
    "[ fig : g0.56 - 0.01 ] ( upper panel ) shows the gis image of g0.56@xmath00.01 ( ax  j1747.0@xmath02828 ) in 67 kev band , where this source can be seen the most significantly .",
    "the x - ray emitting region is compact and not resolved with gis .    the background subtracted spectrum is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : g0.56 - 0.01 ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "we accumulated the source x - ray photons from the @xmath34-radius circular region around ax  j1747.0@xmath02828 , and the background photons , from an elliptical region with the major axis parallel to the galactic plane , excluding the @xmath34-radius circular regions around ax  j1747.0@xmath02828 itself and sgr b2 ( see murakami ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "the spectrum is found to be characterized with a quite strong line at between 67 kev , which is also implied from the x - ray image . we tried to fit the spectrum with the thermal bremsstrahlung and a gaussian line .",
    "then we found the equivalent width of the line to be quite large , @xmath192 kev , and the center energy of the gaussian to be 6.63@xmath350.06 kev , being consistent with k@xmath12 line from helium - like iron .",
    "hence , the spectrum is definitely a thin thermal origin with high temperature of several kev or higher .",
    "we then fitted the spectrum with a thin thermal plasma model .",
    "the model well represents the total spectral shape .",
    "the best - fit temperature is @xmath36 kev , the abundance , @xmath37 solar , and the hydrogen column density , @xmath38 .",
    "the flux is 1.610@xmath17 in 0.710 kev band .",
    "the large column density suggests this source to be located at near the galactic center .",
    "thus , the absorption corrected x - ray luminosity is estimated at @xmath193.610@xmath39 under the assumption of the distance of 8.5 kpc .    this high temperature and",
    "the overabundance suggest ax  j1747.0@xmath02828 to be a possible new candidate of a young snr .",
    "the luminosity is also within the range of that of the typical snr .",
    "although the supernova remnant is the most probable source , the other possibility , for example , a cataclysmic variable , still can not be excluded ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in any case , it is a new class object in the galactic center region , which is a good candidate for the origin of the galactic center plasma .",
    "snrs are one of the possible candidates for the origin of the galactic center hot plasma .    with , we completely surveyed the region of @xmath40and @xmath41 , where a large portion of snrs in this region are expected to exist , and partially surveyed some areas with larger galactic latitude .",
    "the number of the detected snrs with is two or three in 7 cataloged snrs , and two for the new candidates in the galactic center region . on the other hand , the required number to be responsible for the galactic center plasma is about 10@xmath5 in the region of @xmath42and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the number of the detected snrs is quite insufficient .    from recent radio molecular line observations , hasegawa ( 1998 ) found over 300 shell - like structures ,",
    "possibly snrs , in the region of @xmath44 , which correspond to about 20 shell - like structures along any line of sight in the region .",
    "therefore , the number of snrs may be possibly too much to resolve with .",
    "future observations with higher angular resolution would be required to solve this problem .",
    "the spectra of four of the detected five snrs ( or candidates ) are relatively soft ( g359.1@xmath00.5 , g359.1@xmath10.9 , and g0.0@xmath01.3 ( ax  j1751@xmath029.6 ) ) or have no line - like feature ( g0.9@xmath10.1 ) .",
    "thus they can not explain the spectrum of the galactic center plasma .",
    "on the other hand , a new snr candidate g0.56@xmath00.01 ( ax  j1747.0@xmath02828 ) is notable for the strong iron line similar to that of the galactic center plasma .",
    "such class of objects may be a key to understand the origin of the plasma .",
    "search for such objects will be strongly encouraged .",
