    "willman 1 is a small diffuse low - luminosity object identified by willman et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter w05 ) from an analysis of the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "its size and luminosity were found to be consistent with both low - luminosity globular clusters ( e.g. , palomar 1 , e3 , am 4 , bh 176 , sau a and am 1 ) and low - luminosity dsph galaxies ( see figure 10 of w05 ) .",
    "further investigation revealed irregular structure , possible mass segregation and a spatial size too large for willman 1 to be bound without substantial amounts of dark matter ( willman et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter w07 ) .",
    "spectroscopic study ( martin et al . 2007 ; hereafter m07 ) showed that willman 1 s red giant branch ( rgb ) stars appear to form a velocity group at -12.3 km s@xmath3 with a moderate velocity dispersion ( 4.3 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the latter implies a high ( 470 - 700 ) mass to light ( m / l ) ratio that would potentially be enough to bind willman 1 at its present galactocentric distance .",
    "additionally , m07 show an apparent spread in abundance with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.5  the latter being consistent with the abundance estimate from main sequence photometry ( w07 ; m07 ) .",
    "the combination of abundance spread and high dark matter content would indicate that willman 1 is a dsph galaxy  the lowest luminosity dsph known to be orbiting the galaxy .",
    "however , if willman 1 is a dsph galaxy , its properties depart significantly from the established patterns of dsph properties ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the m / l ratio and [ fe / h ] abundance of dsph galaxies have been shown to follow total luminosity ( see , e.g. , mateo 1998 ) , a trend used to argue that the dsph galaxies are of similar mass and origin .",
    "m07 noted and we confirm that willman 1 s apparent m / l ratio is an order of magnitude lower than the linear trend established in milky way dsph galaxies  although it is similar to other dsph galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "willman 1 is also significantly more metal - rich that dsph galaxies of comparable luminosity .",
    "simon & geha ( 2007 , hereafter sg07 ) used similar departures from the established @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 trends to argue that the coma and ursa major ii dsph galaxies could be the tidally disrupted remnants of larger forebears .",
    "however , while ursa major ii appears to overlap the  orphan stream \" ( belokurov et al . 2007 ) , neither coma nor willman 1 are known to overlap a halo stream .",
    "this is particularly problematic in the case of willman 1 .",
    "if willman 1 s relatively high metallicity reflects its initial , rather than current , luminosity , figure 1 would indicate that willman 1 s tidal stream would contain _ several thousand _ times more mass than its core .    in this paper",
    ", we add several pieces of information to the previous studies of willman 1 in an effort to clarify its nature .",
    "we improve membership analysis and provide better constraint on the abundance distribution using optimized spectra of two supposed willman 1 members and washington+@xmath2 photometry (  3.1 ) .",
    "we also survey willman 1 for rr lyrae stars (  3.2 ) and use wide - field photometry to probe the extended distribution of the putative dwarf (  3.3 ) .",
    "we obtained spectra of the two brightest willman 1 rgb stars identified by m07 and three bright rgb candidates identified from washington photometry (  3.1 ) using the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and high resolution spectrograph ( hrs , tull 1998 ) .",
    "data were obtained as part of standard queue scheduled observing ( shetrone et al .",
    "2007 ) in november 2006 and april 2007 .",
    "hrs was configured to achieve r=18,000 over the spectral range of 4840 - 6820  with the 600g5822 cross - disperser .",
    "the november data , which were used for abundance analysis , consist of multiple 2250 - 2700 second exposures taken over several nights to achieve total exposure times of 4500 - 16200 seconds and snr of 23 - 30 per resolution element . the april data , taken to determine radial velocities , have total exposure times between 600 and 720 seconds to achieve snr @xmath6 15 per resolution element .",
    "the spectra were reduced with iraf s echelle and twodspec scripts .",
    "the standard iraf scripts for overscan removal , bias subtraction , flat fielding and scattered light removal were employed .",
    "the sky fiber spectra were extracted separately and the two resulting sky spectra were combined and subtracted from the target spectra .",
    "we confirmed that no residual solar spectrum remained in the target spectra by cross - correlating to the solar atlas of hinkle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and looking for a peak at zero relative velocity .",
    "the target spectra were shifted to the heliocentric rest frame by cross - correlating with the hinkle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) arcturus atlas and combined in the rest frame .",
    "we observed willman 1 with the mcdonald observatory 0.8 m telescope and prime focus corrector ( pfc ) on ut 19 - 20 march 2007 and 16 - 19 april 2007 .",
    "photometry was obtained in the broadband @xmath7 , washington @xmath8 and intermediate - band @xmath2 filters .",
    "although unguided , the 0.8 m telescope is stable enough over 600 second time intervals to produce excellent wide - field photometry at the coarse ( 1.3 \" /pixel ) pixel scale of the pfc with little image ellipticity . in an effort to identify any variable stars in the field , we observed ten @xmath9-band epochs over the course of the observing runs .",
    "total observing times were 6000 , 600 , 600 , 1200 and 6000 seconds in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 filters , respectively . the 460 field of the pfc should easily enclose the entirety of the willman 1 object , which has a measured half - light radius of @xmath13 and a limiting radius of @xmath14 ( w05 , w07 and m07 ) .",
    "the pfc covers nearly twice the area of sky as w07 s and m07 s photometric surveys , although to much shallower depth .",
    "data were reduced with iraf ccdproc package and photometered using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "photometry was calibrated to the standards of landolt ( 1992 ) and geisler ( 1990 , 1996 ) using iterative techniques described in siegel et al .",
    "both standard and object stars were measured to total magnitudes using the curve - of - growth analysis of daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the run of photometric error with @xmath10 magnitude .",
    "the line marks the assumed apparent magnitude of willman 1 s horizontal branch ( hb ) assuming @xmath15 = 0.15 [ fe / h ] + 0.80 and taking the m07 [ fe / h ] and @xmath16 values of -1.5 and 17.9 , respectively .",
    "the reddening maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indicate the field should have minimal extinction ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that the data provide good ( @xmath18 ) photometry in all passbands for any stars on willman 1 s hb or upper rgb .",
    "our data do not reach the msto of willman 1 , which would be near @xmath19 .",
    "accurate stellar positions were measured using the iraf task tfinder with the nomad astrometric catalog ( zacharias et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the abundance distribution and velocity dispersion measured by m07 are key arguments for willman 1 s classification as a dsph galaxy and both are inconsistent with the trends established from other dsphs ( figure 1 ) .",
    "however , surveys of willman 1 are hard - pressed to separate out _ bona fide",
    "_ members of such a low surface - brightness object from the strong foreground of milky way disk stars .",
    "radial velocities are helpful but willman 1 s radial velocity is near the center of the galactic field star radial velocity distribution ( figure 3 ) , which complicates membership assignment . m07 overcome this difficulty by using the equivalent width of na lines as a surface gravity discriminant . however , additional information on stellar surface gravities can be acquired either directly through high s / n spectra or indirectly through a photometric proxy .",
    "we used the het to observe two bright stars classified as willman 1 members by m07 ( 1269 and 1578 in our table 1 ) in an effort to determine surface gravities and abundances .",
    "the analysis for these two stars used the methods and calibrations of shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) but with the adjustment that the temperature was set to match photometric temperatures derived using the color - temperature relations of ramirez & melendez ( 2005 ) .",

    "we attempted to fit the light curve using the fitting code and templates of layden ( 1998 ) and siegel ( 2006 ) but found the fit periods to be degenerate .",
    "while the data are not extensive enough to break the period degeneracy , they indicate that this variable is unlikely to be associated with willman 1 .",
    "first , the variable star has a mean magnitude of @xmath50 , two mag brighter than the likely hb of willman 1 ( see figure 8) .",
    "second , the variable is over 20 from the nominal willman 1 center ",
    "ten times the @xmath44 measured by w05 .",
    "although located within @xmath51 of the apparent willman 1 major axis ( see figure 3 of w07 ) , is it unlikely that the only variable star in willman 1 would be so far removed from the photocenter .",
    "the simplest and most likely explanation is that the variable star is a foreground rr lyrae star .",
    "it is possible , but less likely , that it is an anomalous cepheid ( ac , pritzl et al . 2004 ) associated with willman 1 and embedded in an extended stellar distribution . the specific frequency of acs has been shown to increase with declining mass and abundance ( mateo et al .",
    "1995 ; pritzl et al .",
    "however , willman 1 is so small that even if the pritzl et al .",
    "absolute magnitude - specific frequency relation were extrapolated over another _",
    "six _ magnitudes , it would predict less than one ac . the abundance - specific frequency relation would predict zero acs , whether evaluated at [ fe / h]=-1.5 or -2.2 .",
    "figure 8 shows the @xmath7 , @xmath46 and @xmath8 color - magnitude diagrams of the willman 1 field .",
    "these diagrams have been cleaned to retain only objects with daophot _ sharp _ parameters between -0.1 and 0.1 and photometric errors below 0.15 mag .",
    "the hb magnitude and isochrones are identical to those in figure 6 .",
    "the starred point indicates the variable star identified in  3.2 while the squares indicate the bhb star identified in w05 from sdss and the rgb star we confirm in  3.1 .",
    "consistent with previous investigations and  3.1 , we find little evidence of a prominent rgb in the 0.6 square degree pfc field .",
    "there is a slight overdensity where the lower part of the willman 1 rgb is located .",
    "however , these faint blue objects show a flat spatial distribution across the field and are therefore more likely to represent the metal - poor turnoff of the halo field stars or compact background galaxies .",
    "the cmds show about a dozen stars slightly bluer than the field star edge with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath33 colors similar to bhb stars .",
    "a handful of these are clumped at the faint end of the data near v@xmath54 and could potentially be a diffuse willman 1 hb if the distance modulus has been badly underestimated",
    ". however , the number and magnitude distribution of these objects would also be consistent with the number and magnitude distribution of faint blue field stars we have seen in similar surveys of other dsph galaxies such as bootes ( siegel 2006 ) .",
    "they also do not show any central concentration in the field .    that these faint blue objects are not willman 1 hb stars is demonstrated in figure 9 , which compares the raw @xmath46 field cmd to one overlayed with both isochrones and synthetic horizontal branches ( shb ) from dotter et al .",
    "the two shbs have 50 stars each and are set at [ fe / h]=-1.5 and -2.2 , [ @xmath0/fe]=+0.0 .",
    "hb mass is set at the mass of the trgb for the relevant isochrone with an average mass loss of @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the apparent sequence of faint blue stars is well below the magnitude of the shb and has a downward slope that is not seen in the synthetic model .",
    "in fact , only three objects are within 0.5 magnitudes of the shb .",
    "the bhb star identified in w05 lies slightly bluer and brighter than the shb .",
    "as noted in  3.1 , this star is at the willman 1 radial velocity .",
    "its location above the shb could indicate either that willman 1 is closer than 40 kpc or that the star is evolving away from the bhb . a second star is within 7 the willman 1 photocenter and along the metal - poor shb but has a @xmath52 color of 0.28 .",
    "our studies of other dsph galaxies ( see , e.g. , siegel 2006 ) have shown this color to lie near or in the instability strip .",
    "since this star does not vary , it is unlikely it is a willman 1 hb star .",
    "finally , a third star , located more than 14 from the willman 1 photocenter , is slightly brighter and bluer than the w05 hb star . while this star could be a willman 1 member",
    ", its membership would require that the star be both extratidal _ and _ unusually blue and evolved .",
    "it is highly unlikely that an object as faint as willman 1 has two such rare bhb stars . in short ,",
    "it is likely that willman 1 does not have any bhb stars within the pfc field beyond the one identified in w05 .",
    "willman 1 could , however , have non - variable rhb stars lost within the field star blue edge .",
    "when combined with the negative detection of extratidal giants (  3.1 ) or rr lyrae (  3.2 ) , this indicates that our thorough 0.6 square degree survey identifies no measurable extended structure in willman 1 . not a single confirmed rgb , rr lyrae or bhb star lies beyond the measured optical limit .",
    "the only confirmed members are the w05 hb star and some of the m05 giants , all of which are within 5 of the willman 1 photocenter .",
    "the paucity of bright spectroscopic targets in willman 1 and the difficulty in using radial velocities alone to separate out members makes conclusions about its nature and properties tentative .",
    "however , our survey results have several important implications about the nature of willman 1 .",
    "@xmath57 the metallicity spread implied by m07 is now less certain . the most metal - rich m07 star , and the only metal - rich member with @xmath58 in m07 , is clearly a foreground dwarf star .",
    "another metal - rich m07 star , 1302 , is close to the dwarf locus , with an rgb probability of 34% . without star 1269 ,",
    "the metallicity dispersion of willman 1 drops to 0.3 dex , which is only slightly greater than the measurement error ( estimated by m07 to be 0.2 dex at s / n=15 ) .",
    "moreover , the remaining metal - rich willman 1 members are close to the msto where the cat abundance method used by m07 it not very reliable since it is designed for use with late - type rgb stars ( rutledge et al . 1997 ; carretta & gratton 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the only confirmed member of willman 1 with an m07 @xmath59 has an abundance of [ fe / h]=-2.1 , which we confirm directly from the fe lines ( as [ fe / h]=-2.2 ) .",
    "_ the existing evidence does not support an abundance spread in willman 1 and hints at a low , rather than intermediate abundance_. figure 10 shows the revised @xmath4 $ ] trend of the dsph galaxies , assuming a -2.2 metallicity for willman 1 and shows that a metal - poor willman 1 would be consistent with the trend established in other very low - luminosity dsph galaxies ( munoz et al . 2006 ; m07 , sg07 ) .",
    "the flattening of the luminosity - metallicy relation  and many of the brighter dsph galaxies with multiple populations having similar trace metal - poor populations  could support the hypothesis of a common origin for many of the dsph galaxies ( kunkel & demers 1977 ; lynden - bell 1982 ; majewski 1994 ; lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ; metz & kroupa 2007 ; metz et al .",
    "2007 ) . alternatively",
    ", this could be a threshold metallicity for the formation of stellar populations .",
    "@xmath57 our study does not affect the inferred velocity dispersion of willman 1 .",
    "the nine member stars we match to our washington photometry have a velocity dispersion of @xmath60 km s@xmath3 . when star 1269 is removed , the remaining m07 stars have a dispersion of @xmath61 km s@xmath3 .",
    "further pruning of the sample  even down to the extreme of the three stars that are either spectroscopically or photometrically classified as giants  does not reduce the velocity dispersion .",
    "we measure a slightly sub - solar @xmath0-abundance in star 1578 , a value similar to but lower than the @xmath0-abundances measured in stars of similar [ fe / h ] in other dsph galaxies ( venn et al . 2004 ) and globular clusters thought to have been tidally stripped from dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , palomar 12 ; dinescu et al . 2000 ; cohen 2004 ) .",
    "this indicates that willman 1 has a chemical evolution history similar , but not identical , to that of other dwarf galaxies .",
    "it certainly formed in a different environment than the milky way field stars or globular clusters .",
    "a slow chemical evolution would be consistent with willman 1 having always been a low - mass object .",
    "@xmath57 while the isophotes of w07 appear to show an irregular object , the wide - field 0.6 square degree survey of willman 1 fails to conclusively identify a single bright rgb star , a single rr lyrae star or a single bhb star outside of the half - light radius ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "in fact , we identify _ no _ willman 1 members beyond those identified in m07 ( several of which appear to be non - members ) .",
    "the lack of extratidal stars supports the structural analysis of m07 and w07 , which , using the more numerous stars of the upper main sequence , show radial profiles that are roughly consistent with a king ( 1962 ) or exponential profile with no indication of extended structure .    @xmath57 it is important , however , to realize that the extant data are limited in their ability to probe the extended structure of willman 1 .",
    "w07 and m07 only trace willman 1 over two orders of magnitude and barely reach the foreground starcount level in the outer isophotes .",
    "such surveys can lack the sensitivity needed to trace low surface - brightness extended structure ( see , e.g. , siegel et al .",
    "while tracer studies of evolved stars are more sensitive to low surface - brightness extensions , willman 1 is so small and sparse that even the @xmath2 photometry provides no additional information on the surface brightness profile .",
    "only a deeper survey using an 8-m class imager would be able to trace willman 1 s outer isophotes to fainter levels using faint main sequence stars .",
    "these properties are consistent with a low - mass dark matter - dominated dsph galaxy .",
    "however , it is worth noting that they would also be consistent with a low - mass globular cluster in the late stages of tidal disruption by the milky way .",
    "willman 1 bears some resemblance to the globular cluster palomar 13 .",
    "pal 13 , like willman 1 , is small , diffuse and shows signs of being tidally disrupted ( siegel et al .",
    "cote et al . ( 2002 ) measured an apparent m / l ratio of 40 for pal 13 .",
    "while this can be interpreted as an indication of dark matter , objects in the final throes of tidal disruption can also have an inflated core velocity dispersion ( munoz et al .",
    ". moreover , blecha et al . ( 2004 ) and clark et al . ( 2004 ) have shown that palomar 13 has a high binary fraction , possibly resulting from the preferential loss of low - mass stars , which inflates the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "this is an important point to keep in mind with willman 1 , which , like palomar 13 , could have an inflated velocity dispersion owing to its overlap with the disk radial velocity distribution , its sparseness and/or a high binary fraction .",
    "a binary fraction enhanced by mass loss would also account for the broad ms observed in m07 and w07 , obviating the need for an abundance spread .",
    "determining if willman 1 is a low - luminosity dsph or a disrupting globular cluster remains just out of reach of the present studies but is amenable to further investigation .",
    "deep spectroscopy from next - generation telescopes would allow abundances to be measured for the msto and ms stars , minimizing the problem of foreground dwarf contamination .",
    "further spectroscopy and more extensive photometry would reveal if willman 1 , like palomar 13 , has a high binary fraction that is inflating its velocity dispersion .",
    "proper motions would allow separation of member stars from the field and determine the orbit of willman 1 , revealing much about its dynamical past .",
    "as more low - luminosity objects are discovered in the sdss , the parameter - space defined by these objects will become clearer . for the moment",
    ", willman 1 still remains in the nebulous parameter space between dsph galaxies and globular clusters .",
    "it has yet to definitively reveal its nature .",
    "support for this work was provided by nsf grant ast-0306884 we would like to thank steve odewahn , eusebio terrazas , john caldwell , heinz edelmann , vicki riley and frank deglman for their assistance in collecting the het spectra .",
