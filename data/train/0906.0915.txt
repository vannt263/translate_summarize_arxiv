    "the valence electron shell of re is 6s@xmath46 and 5d@xmath47 , and that of n is 2s@xmath46p@xmath48 so that the total number of valence electrons is 17 for ren@xmath7 .",
    "ved obtained in four phases ( table i ) is slightly lower than that of re metal ( 0.4761 electrons / @xmath48 ) due to the adding of n atoms .",

    ", ren@xmath0 has a very high bulk modulus , and therefore can be regarded as a candidate of a superhard material .",
    "however , a high bulk modulus by itself does not directly lead to high hardness .",
    "in general , both high bulk modulus and high shear modulus are indispensable to high hardness .",
    "therefore , the shear modulus must be taken into account when searching for new superhard materials .",
    "the bulk modulus represents the resistance to fracture , while the shear modulus represents the resistance to plastic deformation .",
    "moreover , two other factors are important for technological and engineering applications : young s modulus _ e _ and poisson s ratio @xmath58 .",
    "young s modulus , defined as the ratio between stress and strain , is used to provide a measure of stiffness of the solid .",
    "the larger the value of _ e _ , the stiffer the material .",

    "g _ , and young s modulus",
    "_ e _ of ren@xmath0 with @xmath1 structure are 334 gpa , 127 gpa , and 337 gpa , respectively , of which the bulk modulus of ren@xmath0 is slightly smaller than that of re metal ( 360 gpa ) .",
    "it is worthy to note that the bulk modulus obtained from the elastic constants agrees well with the one obtained through the fit to the 3rd - order birch murnaghan eos ( b@xmath38 ) , providing a consistent estimation of the compressibility for ren@xmath0 .",
    "ratio @xmath58 reflects the stability of a crystal against shear",
    ". this ratio can formally take values between -1 and 0.5 , which corresponds respectively to the lower limit where the material does not change its shape , or to the upper limit when the volume remains unchanged .",
    "poisson s ratio of @xmath1 structure is 0.3319 , which is larger than 0.3 , indicating that there exists small volume change during elastic deformation .",
    "also possion s ratio provides more information on the characteristics of the bonding forces .",
    "it has been proved that @xmath58=0.25 is the lower limit for central - force solids and 0.5 is the upper limit , which corresponds to infinite elastic anisotropy .",
    "the high value @xmath58 for ren@xmath7 means that the central interatomic forces are central.@xcite in order to predict the brittle and ductile behavior of solids , pugh introduced the ratio of the bulk modulus to shear modulus of polycrystalline phases.@xcite a high ( low ) _",
    "value is associated with ductility ( brittleness ) . the critical value which separates ductile and brittle materials is about 1.75 .",
    "the significant difference obtained between bulk and shear modulus indicates the higher ductility of ren@xmath0 .",
    "now , we turn to discuss the elastic anisotropy of ren@xmath0 , which is estimated by the universal anisotropy index @xmath61.@xcite the discrepancy of @xmath62 from zero determines the extent of single crystal anisotropy and accounts for both the shear and the bulk contributions . the obtained @xmath62 value is 1.252 , indicating that ren@xmath7 has a large elastic anisotropy . additionally , fractional axis compression as a function of pressure are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the curves presented in this figure clearly exhibit that : a bigger difference in fractional axis compression values exists for @xmath1 phase , implicating that there is a evident structure deformation with increasing pressure ; there is a transition point for compression along @xmath63- and @xmath23-axis with increasing pressure , that is , @xmath63-axis is more difficult to be compressed than @xmath23-axis at 38 gpa above .",
    "this abnormality for compression along different axis can foretell that there is a structural phase transition at about 40 gpa .",
    "further analysis of the change of the structural parameters ( atomic coordination , bond length , et al . ) shows that from 40 to 45 gpa fractional coordinations @xmath42 and @xmath43 in 8@xmath31 ( @xmath42 , @xmath41 , @xmath43 ) sites ( n atoms ) change much , yielding the great change of the nearest distance between n atoms ( @xmath64 ) . in detail , at 40 gpa , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are 0.2184 and 0.0752 , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath42 and @xmath43 reduce to 0.1385 and 0.0349 at 45 gpa , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath64 reduces from 2.359   at 40 gpa to 1.432   at 45 gpa .",
    "further , the debye temperature @xmath65 which correlates with many physical properties of materials , such as specific heat , elastic constants , and melting temperature is given .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath65 can be calculated by the equation @xmath66^{1/3 } [ \\frac{2}{3}(\\frac{\\rho}{g})^{3/2}+\\frac{1}{3 } ( \\frac{\\rho}{b+4g/3})^{3/2}]^{-1/3}$],@xcite where @xmath67 is plank s constant , @xmath68 is boltzmann s constant ,",
    "@xmath69 is avogadro s number , @xmath70 is density , @xmath71 is the molecular weight and @xmath72 is the number of atoms in the molecule .",
    "the calculated @xmath65 value of 735 k in @xmath1 is comparative to the values of 866.4 @xmath73 in reb@xmath0@xcite , 850 @xmath73 in reo@xmath7@xcite and 691 @xmath73 in osn@xmath0.@xcite employing the correlation between the shear modulus and vickers hardness reported by teter @xcite for a wide variety of hard materials , the indentation hardness of ren@xmath0 can be estimated to be approximately 17.1gpa , which is comparable to that of si@xmath2n@xmath3 ( 21@xmath74 gpa).@xcite it is well known that the hardness of superhard materials should be higher than 40 gpa , indicating that ren@xmath0 is not a superhard material .",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed that the hardness is determined by elastic constant _ _",
    "c__@xmath52 rather than shear modulus . in our case",
    ", we note that there is little difference between the _",
    "_ c__@xmath52 value of elastic constant and shear modulus .",
    "accordingly , both teter estimation and jhi s viewpoint of hardness actually achieve a consistent result for ren@xmath0 .      in order to understand the nature of elastic property",
    ", the electronic density of states is also analyzed .",
    "the total and partial density of states ( dos ) with respect to fermi level is shown in fig .",
    "3 . finite dos at fermi level _",
    "n_(e@xmath75 ) of 5.035 states / ev shows that ren@xmath0 is metallic .",
    "the electrons from re-5__d _ _ and the n-2__p _ _ states both contribute much to the dos near the fermi level .",
    "that is , the electronic structure of ren@xmath0 is governed by strong hybridization between the re-5@xmath31 and n-2@xmath76 states , imaging that there is a covalent bond in between re and n atoms .",
    "the existence of covalent bonding contributes to large bulk modulus , i.e. , strong incompressibility .",
    "however , we have not found any pseudogap that observed in reb@xmath0,@xcite osb@xmath0@xcite and osn@xmath0,@xcite implying that covalent bonding in between re and n atoms is not so strong . besides , the calculated net charges on n and re atom are -0.57 e and 1.15 e , which indicates that the chemical bonding between re and n have some characteristics of ionicity .",
    "the occurrence of ionic bonding results in the smaller shear modulus , which explains the reason of the not so large hardness in ren@xmath7 .",
    "in conclusion , the most stable structure of ren@xmath0 is explored based on first - principles methods in the framework of density functional theory within local density approximation .",
    "it results that orthorhombic @xmath1 structure is the most stable structure at ambient pressure .",
