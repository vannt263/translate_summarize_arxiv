    "vehicular ad - hoc networks ( vanets ) are formed by a collection of vehicles , wirelessly connected to each other to form a communication network .",
    "these networks are typically one dimensional as they dynamically and rapidly self - organise on roads and highways , although communication with road side access point infrastructure is possible under different scenarios . primarily ,",
    "vehicle to vehicle ( v2v ) and vehicle to infrastructure ( v2i ) communications involve safety related issues , such as collision warnings aimed at preventing imminent car accidents through broadcasting and relaying messages , thereby increasing local situation awareness @xcite .",
    "v2v communications can also be exploited for applications such as intelligent cruise control or platooning , traffic information and management , as well as internet access and advertising .",
    "the ieee 802.11p standard defines a wireless area network ( wlan ) for dedicated short range communication ( dsrc ) among vehicles .",
    "the standard defines protocols for the physical and mac layers , has a 75 mhz bandwidth allocated at 5.9 ghz , and is the prime candidate currently being deployed in order to get ieee 802.11p equipped cars on the roads @xcite . under the standard , it is possible to bundle together information on position , speed , direction , brake information , steering wheel angle , threat - events , etc . , and append them to a _",
    "basic safety message _ ( bsm ) which is then broadcasted @xcite .",
    "vehicles within range can then actuate on this information , edit it , or append to the content message , and re - broadcast , thus locally flooding the network .",
    "flooding algorithms are commonplace in ad hoc networks , however here the algorithm is also spatially constrained to run along a one - dimensional road network .",
    "such networks are typically modelled as random geometric graphs @xcite formed by a 1d poisson point process ( ppp ) and a communication range @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : graph ] ) directly related to snr @xcite thus lending themselves to mathematical analysis and engineering .",
    "a major challenge in vanets is the timeliness and latency in which information must arrive to be useful to a fast approaching vehicle .",
    "hop - count statistics find application in a variety of other settings , e.g. , in gas pipe sensor networks @xcite , nanowires @xcite , and map navigation problems in general .",
    "therefore , hop - count statistics have been extensively studied in 1d @xcite and 2d networks @xcite .",
    "they were first studied by chandler @xcite , who looked at the probability that two wireless network nodes can communicate in @xmath1 hops .",
    "such information can further assist the calculation of network centrality measures @xcite , or achieve range - free localisation @xcite .    )",
    "used to model a vanet .",
    "the geodesic length between the two extreme nodes is @xmath2 . ]    in this paper we are concerned with the statistical properties of the _ shortest _ multihop paths , also referred to as _",
    "geodesics _ , between nodes in 1d vanets .",
    "to this end , we calculate for the first time the first few moments of the number of geodesics @xmath3 between nodes in a 1d vanet , as a function of the euclidean distance @xmath4 between them and the vehicle density @xmath5 .",
    "clearly for @xmath6 , the shortest possible path is of length @xmath1 hops , employing just @xmath7 relay nodes , thus defining a fundamental upper limit on the latency involved with such transmissions . on",
    "the other hand , due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions , multiple bsms containing similar information may arrive via different @xmath1-hop paths almost simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand the statistical properties of the number of @xmath1-hop paths @xmath8 , as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "such statistics can be used to enhance throughput @xcite , validate threat events , protect against collusion attacks , infer location information , and also limit redundant broadcasts thus reducing interference .",
    "must involve at least 1 relay node located in each of the shaded  lenses \" . ]",
    "consider a source node @xmath9 located at the origin , and a destination node @xmath10 a distance @xmath11 to the right of @xmath9 along the positive real line .",
    "further , consider a 1d ppp of density @xmath5 vehicles per unit length forming on the real line , with each point ( node ) representing a vehicle along an infinite stretch of road .",
    "nodes are then connected via communication links whenever their euclidean distance is less than a predefined communication range @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , thus forming a 1d network .",
    "the source and destination nodes are unable to communicate directly and must employ multihop communications in order to share information .",
    "depending on the density of vehicles @xmath5 , there may be none , one , or several multihop paths connecting @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the _ length _ of these paths is the number of hops required for a message to pass between the two vehicles .",
    "it follows that the length of the _ shortest _ multihop paths is @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , paths of length @xmath1 are geodesic . running a breadth - first search ( bfs ) algorithm can find all geodesic paths in linear - time since the underlying graph is neither directed , nor weighted .",
    "let the set of all geodesics be described by @xmath13 .",
    "then the number of geodesic paths is @xmath14 .\\end{split}\\ ] ] monte carlo simulations of the pmf of @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "we will first demonstrate the difficulties with obtaining the distribution of @xmath8 for the case of @xmath15 , and then calculate its first few moments for the general case of @xmath16 .",
    "the cases of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are trivial and therefore omitted .     for @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that geodesics are of length @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath15 as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] such that there are two sub - domains @xmath24 and @xmath25 within which relay nodes must be situated in order for a 3-hop path to exist .",
    "we call these sub - domains lenses , since in two dimensions they are formed by the intersection of two equal disks .",
    "this is because the first relay node located at a maximum distance of @xmath0 can form a 3-hop path by connecting with any node in @xmath26 $ ] . by symmetry",
    "@xmath27 $ ] such that the two lenses are of equal widths @xmath28 .",
    "the number @xmath29 of relay nodes in @xmath24 is therefore a poisson random variable with mean @xmath30 , where we have defined @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , for each relay node in @xmath24 there corresponds a subset of @xmath25 within which a second relay node must be located as to form a 3-hop path from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . labelling the @xmath29 relays in descending distances @xmath32 from the source ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) we can identify subsets @xmath34\\subseteq l_2 $ ] within which if located a second relay can successfully form a 3-hop path . defining the sub - domains @xmath35 $ ] , for @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "it can be seen that a relay node in @xmath39 connects to @xmath40 relays in @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore arrive at a simple expression for the number of shortest 3-hop paths @xmath41 where the @xmath42 is the number of relays in @xmath39 and are thus poisson random variables with mean @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : windows ] ) .",
    "the widths @xmath39 are also random variables however must satisfy the constraint that @xmath44 , i.e. , the @xmath42 are correlated .",
    "nodes in the left lens @xmath24 , and the corresponding sub - domains @xmath39 in the right lens @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is within range from all three nodes and therefore a fourth node located in @xmath45 will connect to all in @xmath24 , to form three @xmath21-hop paths from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath46 is in range of nodes 1 and 2 ( not 3 ) , @xmath47 is only in range of node 1 ( not 2 or 3 ) , and @xmath48 is not in range from any of the nodes in @xmath24 . ]",
    "the pmf of @xmath3 can be expressed as follows : @xmath49   \\!=\\ ! \\mathbb{e}_{n_1,\\mathbf{w}}\\big [ \\mathbb{p } [ \\sigma_{3 } \\!=\\ ! x   \\big|   n_1 , \\mathbf{w } ] \\big ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and any configuration of widths @xmath51 is equally likely .",
    "we can attempt to obtain the pmf of @xmath52 through the use of probability generating functions ( pgfs ) .",
    "namely , we have that the pgf of the random variable @xmath53 is given by @xmath54\\!=\\!g_{n_i}(z^i)\\!=\\!e^{\\lambda w_i ( z^i -1)}$ ] since @xmath42 is poisson distributed with mean @xmath43 .",

    "geometrically , the indicator function defines a simplex polytope with @xmath63 vertices at @xmath64 .",
    "the integral is therefore over the surface of the @xmath29-simplex .",
    "recall that the @xmath29-simplex is a triangle , a tetrahedron , a 5-cell , for @xmath65 and @xmath22 respectively , and therefore is an evermore complex polytope embedded in the positive hyperoctant of @xmath66 for which the integration of becomes intractable .",
    "for this reason we next restrict our study to the mean and variance of @xmath52 .",
    "we now describe a method which allows us to analytically derive the moments of @xmath67 .",
    "this involves dividing up the lenses into many small parts and making a simplifying approximation about the interactions .",
    "this allows us to treat the problem as one involving many independent random variables rather than trying to account for dependence .",
    "the final step is to take the limit of the number of divisions of the lenses to infinity , in which our approximation becomes exact .",
    "we firstly split the lenses @xmath68 into a large number @xmath69 of equally sized , disjoint domains @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the number of relay nodes in each @xmath70 is then a poisson distributed random variable @xmath73 with mean @xmath74 . for finite @xmath75",
