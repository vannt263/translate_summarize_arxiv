    "chaotic dynamics is present in many astrophysical systems and stellar variability is not an exception , although in this case , chaos was studied mostly in the context of hydrodynamic models of large amplitude pulsators . @xcite and @xcite found a chaotic behaviour in their radiative type - ii cepheid models ( w  vir and rv  tau ) .",

    "in this paper we report on the chaotic behaviour we have found in a sequence of non - linear convective bl  her models . for the first time in stellar pulsation modelling",
    "we clearly demonstrate the appearance of dynamical phenomena well known and common to classical chaotic systems , both discrete ( e.g. logistic or hnon maps ) and continuous ( e.g. rssler or lorenz equations ) . in all these systems the basic route",
    "to chaos is through a cascade of period doubling bifurcations also present in our models and in earlier studies of radiative type - ii cepheid models @xcite .",
    "in addition , our models display a full wealth of dynamic behaviour characteristic for deterministic chaos . within chaotic band",
    "we find several windows of non - chaotic variation ( windows of order ) , with stable period-@xmath0 limit cycles .",
    "these windows are either extremely narrow or relatively large . in the latter case the periodic window is preceded by the type - i intermittent behaviour , till the periodic cycle is born through the tangent bifurcation .",
    "this periodic cycle again undergoes a series of period doubling bifurcations en route to chaos .",
    "the interior crisis bifurcations , in which separate chaotic bands merge , leading to the abrupt increase of the attractors volume are detected in our models , as well as crisis induced intermittency and type - iii intermittency .",

    "( _ iii _ ) the striking similarity between our hydrodynamic models of pulsating stars and even the simplest chaotic systems , like logistic map , is noteworthy , indicating that many very different systems may share the same dynamical properties .",
    "( _ iv _ ) finally , although the chaotic behaviour was not detected in any bl  her star so far , we can not exclude such possibility in the future .",
    "we note that the period doubling effect in these stars was predicted by @xcite , based on radiative hydrodynamic models , but it took 20 years to discover the effect in the first star of this type @xcite .    in section  [ sec.logistic ]",

    "the reader familiar with the chaos theory may safely skip this section . in section  [ sec.hydro ]",

    "first , a stable period-3 cycle is born together with unstable period-3 cycle .",
    "the stable branch undergoes a series of period doubling bifurcations to form three chaotic bands , which finally collide with the unstable period-3 cycle to form one chaotic band ( section  [ ssec.intercrises ] ) . to the contrary , in the window at @xmath150k , a stable period-6 cycle , which looks like two stable period-3 cycles born very close to each other , emerges from the chaos",
    "we are not aware of any bifurcation that may lead to such scenario and of any other system showing such behaviour .",
    "one of the possibilities is that in fact a pair of stable and unstable period-3 cycles is born , as expected , and stable cycle immediately undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . to check this",

    "if the proposed scenario indeed takes place it must occur in a temperature range narrower than @xmath45k .",
    "the situation at @xmath150k looks even more complex .",
    "it seems that at this temperature we deal with discontinuity  the bifurcation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig.histo ] ) divides into two parts apparently decoupled from each other . on the cool side we clearly see a gradual evolution of the chaotic bands , divided , from time to time , by periodic windows .",
    "this gradual evolution seems to continue till @xmath101k , but not for the band extending at higher effective temperatures .",
    "this behaviour may result from the coexistence of two attractors in the system .",
    "note that by default we initialized all the models along a sequence in the same manner ( section  [ sec.hydro ] ) .",
    "it is possible that such initialization leads to different attractors for models cooler / hotter than @xmath101k . to check the possible existence of other stable attractor(s ) ( with different basins of attraction ) , we have repeated the computation for many models , but with several different initializations .",
    "in all cases however , we finally arrived at the same attractor as in the case of our default initialization . at the moment the cause and nature of bifurcation we observe at @xmath101k remains unclear .",
    "the other phenomenon we have not discussed yet , is the appearance of chaos itself .",
    "the chaotic bands appear through a well understood period doubling route ; the question is about the trigger . in the case of radiative models of @xcite and @xcite , analysis of the floquet coefficients",
    "clearly shows that the first period doubling bifurcation is caused by the half - integer resonance between pulsation modes ( @xmath151 between fundamental and second overtone modes ; * ? ? ?",
    "the following cascade en route to chaos was not analysed .",
    "@xcite analysed a toy model of parametrically driven oscillator and showed that the first period doubling in such system results from the resonance and the following cascade is a result of increasing non - linearity .",
    "we note that the non - linearity may be the only cause of period doublings in classic chaotic systems void of internal resonances .",
    "we do not have appropriate tools ( floquet coefficients ) to proof that half - integer resonance is responsible for the period doubling of single - periodic pulsation we observe at the cool and the hot sides of our computation domain .",

    "the loci of the @xmath155 resonance , causing the period doubled pulsation detected in a single bl  her star @xcite is located more than 300k - off the hot side of the computation domain considered here and likely plays no role .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that non - linearity is the only cause of the observed behaviours .",
    "the appearance of periodic windows is also very interesting and important for stellar pulsation studies . as in the case of period - doubled pulsation",
    ", resonances were also invoked as a possible explanation . in a recent study",
    "@xcite proposed that a @xmath156 resonance between the fundamental mode and the first overtone is responsible for a period-20 cycle behaviour they found in one of their rr  lyrae models ( their model h ; for other model they propose a @xmath157 resonance ) . in this case however , a caution is needed , as inferences about the role of resonance are not based on firm theoretical grounds .",
    "the presence of first overtone can not be deduced from the frequency spectrum .",
    "the role of resonance is most likely deduced based on approximate coincidence of the model s location in the h - r diagram with the loci of the @xmath156 resonance determined with linear pulsation periods . since pulsation periods change in the non - linear regime , and fine - tuning of such high - order resonance is difficult ,",
    "claims on the possible role of resonances must be supported with other ( dynamical ) arguments .",
    "we are not aware of any studies showing that such high - order resonances may indeed have a noticeable effect on stellar pulsations .    in a simpler explanation ,",

    "the @xmath94k neighbours of the discussed model of @xcite show chaos and thus situation corresponds to periodic window within chaotic band , just as we report in this paper ( section  [ ssec.pw ] ) , and as is found in many chaotic systems void of resonances . in chaotic systems",
    "the spectrum of periodic windows is dense ( it is one of the key properties of chaotic systems ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but most of the windows are extremely narrow . based on extreme similarity of our bifurcation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig.histo ] ) , to bifurcation diagrams for other systems , we conclude that also in the case of our computations the spectrum of periodic windows is most likely dense , but most of the windows are extremely narrow ( in effective temperature ) . with the default @xmath44k resolution of our model computation only few of the windows",
    "were detected ( and most of them are narrower than @xmath158k ) .",
    "studying linear periods we find no tight connection between location of the periodic windows and the loci of high - order resonances between low order pulsation modes .",
    "we conclude that existence of periodic windows is an intrinsic property of non - linear system studied in this paper .",
    "there is no need to invoke resonances to explain them .",
    "phenomena discussed in this paper are certainly exotic in the context of bl  her stars . except of period",
    "doubling phenomenon detected in one star @xcite , bl  her stars are single - periodic pulsators .",
    "we recall however , that existence of period - doubled bl  her star was predicted @xmath159 years before its discovery @xcite .",
    "the future detection of other , more complex dynamical phenomena in these stars can not be excluded .    period doubling and irregular brightness variations are common in higher luminosity siblings of bl  her stars , namely in more luminous type ii cepheids of rv  tau type and in semi - regular variables .",
    "period doubling is a characteristic feature of rv  tau stars which , in addition , show irregular variation .",
    "chaos was reported in several stars of these types @xcite .",
    "our models suggest that other phenomena , intrinsic to chaotic dynamics , may also occur in these groups of stars .",
    "particularly interesting would be the discovery of period-@xmath2 behaviour ( with @xmath2 other than 2 ) and of intermittency .",
    "period-@xmath2 behaviour may arise either within a period doubling cascade or within chaotic band .",
    "a possible period-4 behaviour in rv  tau type star , supporting the period - doubling transition to chaos scenario , was reported by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our unpublished analysis of the ogle - iii data for this star does not confirm the detection .",
    "models indicate that in the case of period doubling cascade the domains of period-@xmath2 behaviour get narrower as @xmath2 increases , making the detection less probable for larger @xmath2 .",
    "also most of the periodic windows within chaotic domain are very narrow .",
    "nevertheless , in our opinion , the firm detection of period-4 behaviour in rv  tau stars is only a matter of time .    from observers point of view , the strongest evidence for period-@xmath2 behaviour would be the presence of additional signal in the frequency spectrum , at @xmath160 and its harmonics .",
    "the difficulty arises for long - period variables , as very long time - series is necessary to get sufficient resolution in the sub - harmonic part of the frequency spectrum ( i.e. in a range @xmath161 $ ] ) .",
    "in addition , the effect may be obscured by irregular variability on top of period-@xmath2 behaviour , as is commonly observed in rv  tau stars ( see eg .",
    "lightcurves in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these stars ,",
    "a sporadic switching of the deep and shallow minima also occurs @xcite which is yet another difficulty in the analysis .",
    "therefore , inspection of the time - series , folding the light curve with multiple of the basic period , are invaluable tools to search for the effect .",
    "this however requires not only long time - series , but also well sampled time - series . in this respect the projects aimed at long - term and regular monitoring of the sky or individual stars , such as ogle @xcite , eros ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , asas @xcite , or programs led by amateur associations of variable star observers ( e.g. aavso ) are extremely important and should be continued as long as possible .",
    "it is worth noting that the observations of the only stars rigorously analysed for the presence of chaotic dynamic ( i.e. those from tab .",
    "[ tab.lyap_comparison ] ) were all collected by amateur astronomers and in all cases covered more than 10 years ( up to a century for r  cyg ) .    based on our rather restricted model survey",
    "we can not predict the expected amplitude of brightness alternations within period-@xmath2 cycle . in period - doubled rv",
    "tau stars the amplitude of alternations vary from a hundredth of magnitude to few tenths of magnitude .",
    "more precise the photometry , larger the chance to detect the smaller effect .",
    "long - lasting and frequent observations of the stars are also crucial for the possible detection of intermittency .",
    "models indicate that the intervals of apparently periodic / chaotic behaviour may last many tenths of pulsation cycles which , as pulsation periods of the luminous stars are long , requires a very long monitoring .",
    "again , intermittency is expected in the narrow domains close to the edges of periodic windows and thus probability of its detection is certainly very small .",
    "the bl  her models discussed in this paper fall along a single stripe of constant luminosity in the h - r diagram and cover a range of only @xmath162k .",
    "yet they display a wealth of dynamical behaviours characteristic for deterministic chaos .",
    "many of the discussed phenomena are detected for the first time in the context of stellar pulsation models .",
    "it was possible because our model survey was dedicated to study such phenomena  a tiny step in effective temperature , sometimes as small as @xmath45k ( and @xmath44k max ) , allowed to follow the dynamical evolution of the system from single - periodic pulsation , through period doubling cascade to well developed chaotic regime , and back to single - periodic pulsation .",
    "the chaotic regime turned out to be a gold - mine of interesting dynamical phenomena .",
    "we found several periodic windows ( with cycle-3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 behaviours ) .",
    "we stress that the existence of periodic windows is not related to resonances among pulsation modes , but is an intrinsic property of a chaotic system . at the edges of the largest period-3 and period-6 windows",

    "are interrupted with bursts of chaos . in type - iii intermittency",
    "the oscillations switch between two periodic cycles . in our models",
