    "whereas anderson localization phenomena @xcite are rather well understood for a single particle ( see the reviews @xcite ) , the case of interacting particles in a random potential has remained much more challenging ( see the review @xcite ) . in the field of disordered fermions ,",
    "there has been for instance a lot of works on quantum coulomb glasses ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , including the debate on the existence of a metal - insulator transition for interacting electrons in two dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the field of disordered bosons ,",
    "many studies have been devoted to the existence and properties of the superfluid - insulator transition ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the idea to reformulate the many - body localization problem as an anderson localization problem in fock space or in hilbert space has been very useful @xcite . in particular , this type of analysis has led to the prediction that the conductivity of interacting electrons models could exactly vanish in some finite region of parameters in the absence of any external continuous bath @xcite .",
    "the reason is that conduction mechanisms based on variable - range hopping need a continuous bath to locally supply or absorb energy to permit hopping between levels which are not exactly degenerate . since quantum levels",
    "are discrete , the many - particle system can fail to be an effective heat - bath for itself .",
    "following these ideas , oganesyan and huse have proposed that this type of many - body localization transition could be realized in some one - dimensional lattice models of interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical study concerning the spectral statistics alone presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has turned out to be not completely conclusive as a result of very strong finite - size effects .",
    "moreover , the analogy with anderson localization on high dimensional and cayley tree indicates that criteria based on the level repulsion may not be very appropriate in this case @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we propose to study the existence of a many - body localization transition in the very same model of ref .",
    "@xcite by studying another type of observable which contains some information on the localization of eigenstates .",
    "more precisely , we use an exact renormalization procedure in configuration space to compute numerically the renormalized hopping between two configurations as a function of their distance in configuration space .",
    "we present numerical results on the statistical properties of this renormalized hopping that point towards the existence of a many - body localization transition at a finite disorder strength . in the localized phase , we measure a power - law divergence of the localization length . in the delocalized phase",
    ", we measure an essential singularity for the asymptotic renormalized hopping .",
    "these scaling laws are thus reminiscent of the anderson localization transition on the cayley tree , which is the simplest example of anderson transition in a space of infinite dimension , but the values of exponents are different .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secrg ] , we describe how many - body localization models can be studied numerically via an exact renormalization procedure ( rg ) in configuration space that generalizes aoki real - space rg procedure for anderson localization one - particle models . in section [ secnume ] , we present our numerical results for a one - dimensional lattice model of interacting fermions . in section [ secdiscussion ]",

    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the aoki real space renormalization ( rg ) method for one - particle localization models before we describe its generalization for many - body problems .      for anderson localization models",
    ", there exists an exact real - space renormalization procedure at fixed energy @xmath14 which preserves the green functions of the remaining sites @xcite .",
    "the renormalization ( rg ) procedure can be applied to any anderson localization model of the generic form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the on - site energy of site @xmath17 , and where @xmath18 is the hopping between the sites @xmath17 and @xmath19 . upon the elimination of site @xmath20 in the schrdinger equation at energy @xmath14 @xmath21",
    "the remaining sites satisfy the schrdinger equation at energy @xmath14 with the renormalized parameters @xmath22 these renormalization equations are exact since they are based on elimination of the variable @xmath23 in the schrdinger equation .",
    "as stressed by aoki @xcite , the rg rules preserve the green function for the remaining sites .",
    "this means for instance that if external leads are attached to all surviving sites , the scattering properties will be exactly determined using the renormalized parameters ( see @xcite for more details ) . in particular , the renormalized hopping between the last two surviving sites ( after all other sites have been decimated ) determines the two - point landauer transmission between leads attached to these two points @xcite : it decays exponentially with the distance in the localized phase , it remains finite in the delocalized phase , and at the critical point it becomes multifractal .",
    "the above rg procedure has the following natural generalization for many - body models .",
    "let us denote @xmath24 a configuration of the many - body problem to write the hamiltonian as @xmath25 then the schrdinger equation projected onto the configuration @xmath26 @xmath27 allows to eliminate @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining configurations satisfy the schrdinger equation with renormalized parameters @xmath29 these rules in configuration space have been already used for the two - particle 1d anderson tight - binding model @xcite . in the following , we apply them to a model of interacting fermions that we now describe .      in numerical studies of quantum problems containing both interactions and disorder ,",
    "it is natural to consider first the spatial dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the simplest model is then a chain of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interaction and on - site disorder ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this type of model can also be studied in the language of quantum spin chains as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a powerful time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method has been used to characterize the many - body localized phase . in this paper",
    ", we consider the same class of model , but with second - neighbor hopping in addition , as in ref . @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is defined by the following hamiltonian on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 sites with periodic boundary conditions @xmath31 \\label{hamilton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the usual notations :    \\(i ) @xmath32 represents the number of spinless fermion on site @xmath17 and can take only two values ( @xmath33 if the site is empty or @xmath34 if the site is occupied ) .",
    "the many - body hilbert space has thus for dimension @xmath35 the spinless character has been chosen to reach bigger sizes @xmath2 for a given value of the hilbert space dimension @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the on - site energies @xmath37 are independent gaussian variables with zero mean and variance @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath0 measures the disorder strength ( we have not used the microcanonical constraint of ref .",
    "@xcite consisting in the requirement that @xmath39 should be exactly @xmath38 to reduce statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the nearest - neighbor interaction is chosen to be @xmath40 , the hopping terms between nearest - neighbors and second - neighbors are chosen to be @xmath41 . the second - neighbor hopping is included to have non - integrability at zero randomness , see @xcite for more details on the properties of the model in the zero - disorder limit .",
    "\\(iv ) the total number of particles is conserved : we study the case of half - filling with @xmath42 particles for @xmath2 sites as in @xcite .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is then given by the binomial coefficient @xmath43 physically , the important point is that at leading order , it still grows exponentially in @xmath2 .    in summary , we consider in this paper the model of ref .",
    "@xcite with exactly the same values of parameters , but we study another observable to detect the possible many - body localization transition .",
    "we have applied the rg procedure in configuration space described above , to obtain , in each disordered sample of even size @xmath2 , the renormalized hopping @xmath1 at some energy @xmath14 between two configurations @xmath44 and @xmath45 after the decimation of all other configurations @xmath46 we have made the following choices :    ( c1 ) we consider the zero - energy case @xmath47 , because it represents the center of the many - body energy levels .",
    "indeed , in anderson localization models , it is well known that energy levels near the center are the more favourable to delocalization : if these states are localized , one expects that all other states will also be localized .",
    "( c2 ) we have chosen the following configurations : the configuration @xmath48 has all even sites occupied and all odd sites empty , whereas the configuration @xmath45 has all odd sites occupied and all even sites empty . their distance in configuration space is thus @xmath42 ( the minimal path to go from configuration @xmath48 to configuration @xmath45 requires @xmath42 elementary moves ) . in the absence of disorder",
    ", the model is known to be conducting ( see @xcite for a detailed study of conductivity properties ) ; the two configurations @xmath48 and @xmath45 are equivalent up to a translation of one lattice site , and are thus expected to be connected by a finite renormalized hopping . in the presence of disorder , these two configurations are not equivalent anymore , and one expects that the renormalized hopping @xmath1 will become exponentially small in @xmath2 for sufficiently strong disorder .",
    "this choice ( c2 ) of alternate configurations @xmath48 and @xmath45 can be questioned in various ways .",
    "for instance , if one wishes to maximize the distance in fock space , one obtains the configurations where all particles are on the first half or on the second half : physically , it is however clear that these two configurations are not typical because they are extremely inhomogeneous and because only 4 particles ( 2 particles at each boundary of the macroscopic cluster ) can move for arbitrary large @xmath2 ( instead of an extensive number of particles for typical configurations ) .",
    "more generally , in contrast to usual anderson localization models where all sites are equivalent , a new difficulty that arises in many - body localization models is that all configurations are not equivalent : configurations have different hopping connectivities , and different interaction energies , so that the configuration space has already an inhomogeneous structure even before the introduction of disorder variables .",
    "since an extensive study of the renormalized hoppings in this complicated configuration space is not really possible , we have decided to consider only the choice ( c2 ) of alternate configurations @xmath48 and @xmath45 in the remaining of this paper .",
    "however , to show that our results are meaningful and do not really depend of our precise choice ( c2 ) , we present in section [ sec - corre ] independent numerical results concerning the simplest real - space two - point correlation function .",
    "in this section , we describe our numerical results concerning the statistics of @xmath1 at @xmath47 between the alternate configurations @xmath48 and @xmath45 described above for even sizes @xmath49 with corresponding statistics @xmath50 of disordered samples ( we have also data corresponding to @xmath51 with @xmath52 samples , but this statistics has turned out to be insufficient for most purposes ) .       in the localized phase ( data for the disorder strength @xmath53 ) : ( a ) probability distribution @xmath54 of the logarithm of renormalized hopping @xmath1 for the sizes @xmath55 .",

    "the idea is to analyse whether there exists an anderson localization in configuration space , and to study the consequences for real - space properties .",
    "the geometry of configuration space is usually very different from the regular finite - dimensional lattices considered in anderson one - particle localization models , and has been argued to be qualitatively similar to the cayley tree @xcite . since anderson localization on the cayley tree has been studied for a long time as a mean - field limit @xcite , results and methods have been then borrowed to analyse many - body localization properties of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this approximation by a tree structure has been however sometimes criticized @xcite .",
    "indeed , in many - body localization models , the fock space or hilbert space is never exactly a tree , and thus the approximation by a cayley tree has been proposed as a simplifying approximation to obtain an exactly solved model @xcite ( note however that in @xcite , it has been argued that an effective cayley tree structure should actually well capture the properties of low - dimensional electronic models ) .",
    "but independently of the technical convenience of the tree structure , we believe that the physically important property in this analogy is the infinite - dimension property , defined as the exponential growth of the configuration space @xmath91 with the real - space linear size @xmath2 @xmath92 ( whereas in finite dimension @xmath93 , the configuration space of a single particle grows as a power - law @xmath94 ) . as argued in @xcite , it is the exponential growth of eq .",
