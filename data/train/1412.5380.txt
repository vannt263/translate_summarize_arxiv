    "the observation of 2-solar mass neutron stars  @xcite seems to indicate that the equation of state(eos ) for compact stars needs to be sufficiently stiffer to accommodate the mass larger than 1.5-solar mass .",
    "this observation led us to try to formulate a field theory framework wherein both low and high density regimes are treated on the same footing . the low - density regime is constrained by experimental data available up to and slightly above nuclear matter density @xmath2 and hence is fairly well controlled theoretically but the high density regime much above @xmath2 is more or less uncharted both experimentally and theoretically , the latter due to the lack of lattice qcd . to cover both regimes in a consistent way in a unified field theoretic",
    "approach seems like a tall order , but a first step forward to that goal has been made and this will be reviewed in a long article to appear  @xcite .    in this paper , we will pick up the first case studied for the formulation with a confrontation with the observed massive stars  @xcite , discuss the physical properties of stellar matter with the eos obtained therein and subject it to an observable different from what s given in @xcite , which constitutes a prediction that could be tested in gravity waves .",
    "the aim here is then to confirm or falsify the strategies taken and assumptions made in @xcite .",
    "the hope is that the result would then help point the directions to be taken in the efforts described in @xcite@xcite",
    ".    stated briefly without going into the details found in @xcite which are not needed for this paper , the issue is as follows . when the br scaling ( referred to as  old - br \" ) proposed in 1991  @xcite is applied to the neutron - star calculation using realistic nn potentials  @xcite ,",
    "the mass is estimated to be in the range , @xmath3 , typically less than the massive stars , @xmath4 2@xmath5 . in @xcite@xcite , in the framework that combines scale symmetry and hidden local symmetry of strong interactions for the elementary degrees of freedom , a new density - scaling of the bare parameters of the lagrangian called  new - br / blpr \"",
    "was proposed to incorporate the change in topology of the crystal structure of dense skyrmions , skyrmion @xmath6 half - skyrmion  @xcite , which is expected in large @xmath7 qcd .",
    "it turns out that this is one option among others that one can take for going to high density with the given lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "suppose the threshold density , @xmath8 , is higher but not much higher than the normal nuclear density @xmath2 , then we expect such topology change to have nontrivial effects on nuclear matter at the density @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that the effect is drastic , specially in the symmetry energy .",
    "as precisely stated in @xcite , the change in the symmetry energy observed at the density @xmath8  @xcite@xcite can be translated into the parameter changes of the effective lagrangian , leading to a new scaling in physical quantities .",
    "one of the most dramatic effects of the parameter change is the modification of the nuclear tensor forces , thereby drastically affecting the symmetry energy at high density @xmath10 . in a nutshell ,",
    "what happens is that the contribution to the tensor forces by the exchange of the @xmath11 meson gets strongly suppressed at @xmath8 , thereby increasing the net tensor forces entering into the eos . in @xcite ,",
    "the new br / blpr scaling was incorporated into the @xmath12-implemented nuclear eft and the mass - radius relation of a compact object of a pure neutron matter was calculated .",
    "it was found that the eos got stiffer at @xmath8 , giving rise to a star mass as large as @xmath13 , seemingly consistent with the recently observed high mass neutron stars . in arriving at this result which is consistent with the observables of  @xcite ,",
    "certain assumptions are made that require verification .",
    "it is the purpose of this note that some of those assumptions be verified by gravity - wave observations , probing properties different from or additional to those of  @xcite .    in what we do below",
    ", we make the approach for the compact star more realistic than in @xcite with electrons , protons and neutrons , which are believed to be in weak equilibrium , rather than pure neutron matter . near the surface of star , which is supposed to be in lower density region , @xmath14",
    ", we adopt the equation of state used by k. hebeler _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed , in the range of density we are considering , that the energy density of asymmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) can be described by the conventional form in terms of the symmetry energy factor , @xmath17 , as given by _",
    "nuc ( n , x ) = _ nuc ( n,1/2 ) + n(1 - 2x)^2 s ( n ) , [ enuc ] where @xmath18 is the mass of nucleon and @xmath19 is the fraction of proton density .",
    "then the symmetry energy factor @xmath17 can be written as [ sym_e_fac ] s(n ) & = & [ _ nuc ( n,0 ) - _ nuc ( n , x=1/2)]/n which is equivalent to the difference in the ground - state energy per nucleon between the symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath20 ) and the neutron matter ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the pressure of nuclear matter is given by @xmath22 . in this work ,",
    "we use the corresponding ground - state energy and the symmetry energy factor obtained in @xcite with the new scaling . the chemical potential difference between proton and neutron",
    "is then given by _",
    "n-_p = 4(1 - 2x)s(n ) [ munp ] . in the weak equilibrium , the proton fraction , @xmath23 ,",
    "is determined essentially by the chemical equilibrium condition together with the charge neutrality condition ,    now given an eos for energy density , @xmath24 , and pressure , @xmath25 , the radius @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 can be determined by integrating the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite .",
    "the equations are integrated up to the radius of the star , @xmath26 , where @xmath28 , and the mass of the star is determined by @xmath27 .",
    "what we are particularly interested in is that the masses and radii , which depend on the equation of state , are important in predicting the gravitational waves emitted from the coalescing binary neutron stars . during the inspiral period of binary neutron stars , tidal distortions of neutron stars",
    "are expected and the resulting gravitational wave is expected to carry a clean imprint of the equation of states involved  @xcite .",
    "the tidal deformability of polytropic eos , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a pressure constant and @xmath31 is the polytropic index , were evaluated by flanagan and hinderer @xcite and by others in more detail  @xcite .",
    "however , polytropes are known to be a rough approximation to the eos . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the mass - radius and the tidal deformability using the stiffer eos , which has been recently proposed with the new scaling law ( new - br )  @xcite .    the equation of state of compact stars with neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in weak equilibrium and charge neutrality condition is discussed and the mass and radius are estimated .",
    "we then apply the new stiffer eos to investigate the tidal deformation of compact stars .",
    "the results obtained are clear - cut , parameter - free and could be confirmed or falsified in forthcoming ligo gravity - wave observations .",
    "this confrontation with nature could give a hint as to whether the novel structure of the eos predicted by the new scaling law is viable .",
    "we use units in which @xmath32 and the notation in which minkowski metric @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the asymmetry of neutron and proton numbers at high density , dictated by the chemical potential difference , inevitably leads to the weak equilibrium configuration with electrons and muons with neutrinos escaped .",
    "it can be summarized by the relation between chemical potentials : the chemical potential difference between neutron and proton should be the same as the electron chemical potential , @xmath34 , where the last equality is due to the muon emergence at higher density when the chemical potential difference from neutron and proton becomes larger than the muon mass . for the charge carriers , protons , electrons and muons with the local charge neutrality condition , @xmath35 one can get the carrier densities at a given density .",

    "what characterizes the approach presented in this work is the stiffening of the eos due to topology change predicted in the description of baryonic matter with skyrmions put on crystal background to access high density .",

    "given that the approach describes fairly well the baryonic matter up to normal nuclear density , it is the changeover of skyrmions to half - skyrmions at a density @xmath100 that is distinctive of the model used .",
    "this topology change involves no change of symmetries  and hence no order parameters , therefore it does not belong to the conventional paradigm of phase transitions .",
    "but it impacts importantly on physical properties as described in various places in a way that is not present in standard nuclear physics approaches available in the literature .",
    "as has been discussed recently  @xcite , there is another way to produce the stiffening in eos to access the massive compact stars .",
    "it is to implement a smooth changeover from hadronic matter  more or less well - described  to strongly correlated quark matter , typically described in njl model . by tuning the parameters of the quark model so as to produce a changeover at a density @xmath101 , it has been possible to reproduce the features compatible with the properties of observed massive stars .    at first sight",
    ", the hybrid hadron - quark model looks quite different from the above new - br model .",
    "however , it is not implausible that the two mechanisms share the same physical mechanism .",
    "in fact , as argued in @xcite , topology can be traded in for quark degrees of freedom via boundary conditions , i.e. , cheshire cat phenomenon .",
    "one can then think of the skyrmion - half - skyrmion transition as depicting baryon - quark transition as one sees in the chiral bag model . in this connection , it would be interesting to see what the hybrid hadron - quark model predicts for the tidal deformation calculated here .",
    "the detections of gravitational wave signals from coalescing binary neutron stars are expected to inform us on the tidal deformation@xcite@xcite .",
    "recently the tidally modified waveforms have been developed up to the high frequency of merger@xcite @xcite , such that the deformability parameter @xmath0 , a function of the neutron - star eos and mass , is measurable within the frequency range of the projected design sensitivity of aligo and adv .",
    "it has been also demonstrated in bayesian analysis that the tidal deformability can be measured to better than @xmath102 g @xmath103 s@xmath104 when multiple inspiral events from three detectors of aligo - adv network  @xcite@xcite are analyzed  @xcite .",
    "they also show that the neutron star radius can be measured to better than @xmath105 km .",
    "thus the simultaneous measurement of mass , radius and deformability using gravitational wave detectors could present an exciting possibility to eventually pin down the highly uncertain eos for the nuclear matter in the mass range of @xmath106 .",
