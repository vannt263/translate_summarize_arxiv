    "in 1979 , telescopes in spacecrafts and astronomers around the world detected the emission of very intense gamma and x rays .",
    "the sources of these rays were first called soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) and later identified as possible remnants of supernova explosions , the tragic death of very massive stars . if this remnant is a neutron star that spins very rapidly , an intense magnetic field is formed ; if it spins slower the magnetic field is strong but not as much as in the first case .",
    "the ordinary neutron stars , also known as pulsars , bear a magnetic field of the order of @xmath3 g. the neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath4 g are known as magnetars and they are believed to be the sources of the intense gamma and x rays detected in 1979 .",
    "most of the time the magnetar remains inactive , but the strong magnetic field causes the solid crust to break into small pieces .",
    "the crustquake leaves a fireball which cools down and emits x rays from its surface until it evaporates completely @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the equation of state used to describe neutron stars in a strong magnetic field is obtained from a field theoretical approach .",
    "two relativistic models are used : one normally called non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) and the other one with a derivative coupling between mesons and baryons . the importance of including anomalous magnetic moments ( amm ) is discussed .",
    "a more recent work @xcite analyses the importance of the scalar - isovector @xmath5 mesons in the eos that describes magnetars . in @xcite density",
    "dependent hadronic models are used with the same purpose . in all three works",
    "the amm of the electrons were not considered because they were shown to cancel out if properly introduced @xcite . in two papers @xcite the amm of the muons",
    "were also taken into account .",
    "all above mentioned papers refer to neutron stars composed of hadrons and leptons .",
    "these stars are called hadronic stars .    in the stellar modeling ,",
    "the structure of the star depends on the assumed equation of state built with appropriate models .",
    "the true ground state of matter remains a source of speculation . in conventional models ,",
    "hadrons are assumed to be the true ground state of the strong interaction .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that _ strange quark matter _ ( sqm ) is the true ground state of all matter .",
    "this hypothesis is known as the bodmer - witten conjecture .",
    "hence , the interior of neutron stars should be composed predominantly of @xmath6 quarks , plus leptons to ensure charge neutrality .",
    "pulsars described by matter composed of sqm are often called strange stars . however , as the strangeness content depends on the model used to describe the quark matter , we prefer to describe any model in which the interior involves deconfined quarks ( not bound in hyperons ) as _ quark stars _ @xcite .",
    "apart from the differences in the eos , an important distinction between quark stars and conventional neutron stars is that the quark stars are self - bound by the strong interaction , whereas neutron stars are bound by gravity .",
    "this allows a quark star to rotate faster than would be possible for a neutron star .",
    "moreover , some authors have argued that quark stars should be bare @xcite , in the sense that any crust would either not form or would be destroyed during the supernova explosion .",
    "the characteristics of the radiation from hot , bare strange stars have been identified @xcite and the electron - positron pairs that can be emitted from bare quark stars @xcite require the existence of a surface layer of electrons tied to the star by a strong electric field .",
    "two of the most common models used to describe quark matter are the mit bag model @xcite and the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that while the electron chemical potential of a quark star described by the mit bag model is very low ( less than 20 mev ) , the njl model gives much higher values reaching 100 mev inside the star , accounting for the necessary electric field that explains the emission of electron - positron pairs .",
    "an important point to be investigated refers to the stability of quark matter in the interior of quark stars .",
    "two different possibilities for the mit bag model can be found in relation to quark matter in the interior of quark stars : the unpaired phase @xcite , which is widely favored in the literature on strange stars , and the color - flavor - locked phase ( cfl ) @xcite , which allows the quarks near the fermi surface to form cooper pairs which condense and break the color gauge symmetry @xcite . at sufficiently high densities",
    "the favored phase is the cfl . in @xcite",
    "the stability of quark matter described by the two - flavor njl model and subject to an external magnetic field was investigated .",
    "it was shown that the stability depends on the strength of this field and on model parameters .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the eos for magnetized quark stars was described with the help of the mit bag model .",
    "amm for the quarks were properly taken into account .    the njl model in a magnetic field",
    "was considered in @xcite and it was shown that the magnetic field spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry . the formalism used in the above mentioned study was based on a previous calculation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the scope of the present work is to study @xmath7 quark matter in a magnetic field within the njl model , with or without the requirement of @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "we focus our work on the su(2 ) version of the model .",
    "moreover , we remark that the present work may also be relevant regarding the physics of non - central heavy ion collisions such as the ones performed at rhic and lhc - cern which can provide a possible signature for the presence of cp - odd domains in the presumably formed quark - gluon plasma phase @xcite . in this particular case one",
    "reaches magnetic fields of about @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( @xmath10 representing the pion mass and @xmath11 the fundamental electric charge ) .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii we set up a lagrangian density adequate to describe two flavor quark matter , in @xmath1 equilibrium , in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this allows the derivations to be carried out in a uniform fashion from a common lagrangian density making the evaluations more transparent and pedagogically more interesting to the reader . using functional techniques we derive the effective potential , which represents landau s free energy density , using the standard large-@xmath0 approximation . in section",
    "iii the relevant expressions for quark matter eos subject to a magnetic field are displayed .",
    "specific cases , for the symmetric version , are discussed in section iv a for finite density and no magnetic field , iv b for zero density in a magnetic field and iv c for the general case of finite density matter in a magnetic field . in section",
    "v , details of matter in @xmath1- equilibrium are given and in section vi our results are shown and discussed . in section vii the more important conclusions are drawn .",
    "in order to consider ( two flavor ) quark stars in @xmath1 equilibrium with strong magnetic fields one may define the following lagrangian density @xmath12 where the quark sector is described by the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xmath13 \\psi_f \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g \\left [ ( { \\bar \\psi}_f \\psi_f)^2 + ( { \\bar \\psi}_f i\\gamma_5 { \\vec \\tau } \\psi_f)^2 \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{njl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a summation over the quark flavors , @xmath14 is implied while @xmath15 represents the quark electric charge .    note that we have used @xmath16 as representing the current masses .",
    "the leptonic sector is given by @xmath17\\psi_l \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{lage}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "one recognizes this sector as being represented by the usual qed type of lagrangian density . as usual ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are used to account for the external magnetic field .",
    "then , since we are interested in a static and constant magnetic field in the @xmath21 direction , @xmath22 .    regarding the actual evaluations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 bear two fundamental differences . due to the quadratic fermionic interaction ,",
    "the former is non renormalizable in 3 + 1 dimensions ( @xmath25 has dimensions of @xmath26 ) , meaning that eventual divergences can not be eliminated by a consistent redefinition of the original model parameters ( fields , masses , and couplings ) .",
    "the renormalizability issue arises during the evaluation of momentum integrals which represent feynman loops and , in the process , one usually employs regularization prescriptions ( e.g. dimensional regularization , sharp cut - off , etc ) which are formal ways to isolate divergences .",
    "however , the procedure introduces _",
    "arbitrary _ parameters with dimensions of energy which do not appear in the _ original _ lagrangian density . later , when ( unlike the 3 + 1 njl model ) the theory is renormalizable , one may choose any value for the arbitrary energy scale and the original parameters _ run _ with it as dictated by the renormalization group . within the njl model a sharp cut off ( @xmath27 ) is preferred and since the model is nonrenormalizable one gives up the very high energy scales fixing @xmath27 to a value related to the physical spectrum under investigation .",
    "this strategy turns the 3 + 1 njl model into an effective model while @xmath27 is treated as a _",
    "parameter_. the experimental values of quantities such as the pion mass ( @xmath28 ) and the pion decay constant @xmath29 are used to fix both , @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "a second important issue regards the fact that , when @xmath30 , the quark propagator brings unwanted infra red divergences meaning that the evaluations have to be carried out in a _ nonperturbative _ fashion .",
    "moreover , very often physical quantities ( such as the self energy ) appear as powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath31 which is greater than the unity spoiling any possibility of success via standard perturbative evaluations .",
    "as far as analytic nonperturbative evaluations are concerned , one can consider one loop contributions dressed up by a fermionic propagator whose effective mass ( @xmath32 ) is determined in a self consistent way .",
    "this approximation is known under different names , e.g. , hartree , large-@xmath0 or mean field approximations ( mfa ) . the leptonic sector , on the other hand , is described by a qed type of lagrangian density which is renormalizable and which , in principle , could be treated in a perturbative fashion . here , we treat the complete @xmath33 in a consistent way by evaluating the thermodynamical potential related to @xmath33 up to one loop .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , in practice , one does not have to consider the full @xmath33 since both sectors have similar polynomial structures , apart from the four quark interaction term which , as discussed , makes the theory nonrenormalizable and renders perturbative calculations useless .",
    "so , concerning the evaluation of the equation of state , our strategy is the following .",
    "we use quantum field methods , in the imaginary time formalism , to evaluate the effective potential , or landau s free energy density ( @xmath34 ) , for the quark sector in the large-@xmath0 approximation . after summing over the matsubara s frequencies we will regularize the divergent ( three ) momentum integrals by using a sharp _ non covariant _ cut off , @xmath27 . when evaluated at its minimum",
    ", the effective potential is equivalent to the thermodynamical potential , @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the pressure , @xmath37 the energy density , @xmath38 the temperature , @xmath39 the entropy density , and @xmath40 the chemical potential ( a sum over repeated indices is implied ) .",
    "the quark density , @xmath41 , and the baryonic density , @xmath42 , are simply related by @xmath43 . for the present study ,",
    "just the zero temperature case is important and , as a consequence , the term with the entropy vanishes .",
    "equivalent results for the leptonic sector , within the same approximation , can be trivially obtained by performing the replacements @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "finally , this procedure allows us to obtain the eos from the full pressure for @xmath1 stable dense quark matter in the presence of a magnetic field(@xmath48 ) @xmath49 where our notation means that @xmath36 is evaluated in terms of the quark effective mass , @xmath32 , which is determined in a ( nonperturbative ) self consistent way while @xmath50 is evaluated at the leptonic bare mass , @xmath51 .",
    "the term @xmath52 arises due to the electromagnetic term @xmath53 in the original lagrangian density . in order to normalize our results",
    "we shall require that the pressure vanishes at zero chemical potentials by defining @xmath54 note that the above normalization prescription , which washes away the @xmath52 term , is not unique and one could as well require that the pressure vanishes at zero chemical potential and zero magnetic field in which case the @xmath52 term survives .",
    "although we use the former prescription for most of the time we will also consider the latter in section vi , when stellar matter is discussed . throughout this paper",
    "we consider the following set of parameters @xcite : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "to obtain the effective potential ( or landau free energy density ) for the quarks , @xmath34 , it is convenient to consider the bosonized version of the njl which is easily obtained by introducing auxiliary fields ( @xmath60 ) through a hubbard - stratonovich type of transformation . here , @xmath34 is evaluated using the large-@xmath0 approximation which is equivalent to the mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "then , to introduce the auxiliary bosonic fields and to render the theory more suitable to apply the large-@xmath0 approximation it is convenient to use @xmath61 formally treating @xmath0 as a large number which is set to its relevant value , @xmath62 , at the end of the evaluations . to retrieve some well known results related to chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) , in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "let us set @xmath63 for the moment . ,",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath48 by modifying some of the relevant feynman rules ] one then has @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "note that the introduction of the auxiliary ( or background ) fields does not change the physics since they do not propagate and their euler - lagrange equations of motion trivially lead to @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , their introduction simplifies the selection of the relevant contributions at any order in @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "basically , each closed quark loop contributes with a factor of @xmath0 while each internal bosonic line brings a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "the effective potential ( or landau s free energy density ) , @xmath34 , is defined as the classical potential which appears ( at the tree level ) in the original plus radiative ( quantum ) corrections . as it is well known , @xmath34 is particularly useful in the study of symmetry breaking / restoration since a symmetry which is observed at the classical level may be broken by quantum corrections with the appearance of a non vanishing order parameter .",
    "the effective potential , which is also the generating functional all 1pi contributions with zero external momenta @xcite , can be readily obtained by integrating over the fermionic fields . within the large-@xmath0 approximation this procedure results in @xcite @xmath70 \\,\\ , .",

    "therefore @xmath79 is the order parameter which signals csb which comes as no surprise since , by the equations of motion , @xmath80 and the existence of a non vanishing quark condensate breaks cs .",
    "equation ( [ gengap ] ) also shows that @xmath79 is identical to the quark self energy within our approximation which allows us to write the effective quark mass as @xmath81 . finally , in the present work , the relevant quantity is the thermodymic potential , @xmath82 , which is defined as landau s free energy at its minimum @xmath83 .",

    "later , when discussing our numerical results , in section vi , we again address some issues related to the symmetric case .",
    "as one can see , in figure [ marcusfig2 ] , the minima obtained for both cases have different values .",
    "the case of symmetric magnetized quark matter has a minimum at a density lower than the one obtained for symmetric quark matter .",
    "the concavity of the curve in that case is also greatest .",
    "now , after reviewing some of the most important issues regarding how symmetric quark matter is affected by the presence of an external magnetic field we can incorporate @xmath1-equilibrium in our results to consider stellar matter .",
    "in a star with quark matter we must impose both , @xmath1 equilibrium and charge neutrality @xcite . through out this paper we only consider the latest stage in the star evolution , when entropy is maximum and neutrinos have already diffused out . the neutrino chemical potential is then set to zero . for @xmath1-equilibrium matter we must add the contribution of leptons ( electrons and muons ) in a magnetic field to the energy density and pressure .",
    "the relations between the chemical potentials of the different particles are given by @xmath175 for charge neutrality we must impose @xmath176 now , eqs .",
    "( [ qch ] ) and ( [ chneutrality ] ) will have to be satisfied together with the self consistent relations for the quark effective mass during the numerical evaluations .",
    "the eos for the leptonic sector is also needed .",
    "let us now obtain this eos by recalling that , as emphasized in the introduction , the total leptonic pressure , @xmath177 , is quickly recovered from the quark pressure , @xmath178 , upon performing obvious replacements such as @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "also , because the leptonic sector does not have the analog of the quartic interaction , @xmath181 , so that when translating the results one takes @xmath182 which lead to @xmath183_{m_l}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{pressbmulep}\\ ] ] being evaluated at the same ( one loop ) approximation level all terms have exactly the same mathematical structure as those in @xmath178 ( including the divergences in the vacuum contribution ) .",
    "a major difference is that all terms in eq .",
    "( [ pressbmu ] ) are evaluated with the bare @xmath51 reflecting the fact that an undressed lepton propagator has been used . at this one loop level of approximation",
    "the leptonic contribution is that of a free gas of relativistic fermions and the divergences contained in the vacuum contribution can be properly absorbed with a zero point subtraction .",
    "however , note that according to our normalization procedure we require @xmath184 at @xmath185 as in the quark case which leads to the following effective pressure for the leptonic sector @xmath186_{m_l}=p^{med}_l \\,\\,,\\ ] ] since @xmath187 and all these quantities are written in terms of the @xmath188-independent mass , @xmath51 .",
    "the result shows that , at the one loop level , only the following ( finite ) medium contribution has to be considered @xmath189 \\right \\},\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the leptonic density is easily evaluated yielding @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "finally , the leptonic energy density reads @xmath192 where , again , a sum over the repeated ( @xmath193 ) indices is implied . finally , the total effective pressure corresponding to the theory described by @xmath33 in the presence of a constant external magnetic field , @xmath48 , is @xmath194    we now have all the ingredients to evaluate the eos in @xmath1 equilibrium since @xmath195 where the quark and leptonic densities are given by eqs .",
    "( [ rhoqmub ] ) and ( [ rholmub ] ) respectively .",
    "we start by discussing , in more detail , the effects of the magnetic field on the eos of symmetric matter described by the usual su(2 ) version of the njl model without @xmath1-equilibrium whose inclusion will be addressed afterwards . whenever mentioned in the figures , @xmath196 g. by symmetric matter we mean @xmath7 matter for which the chemical potential of both particles are equal .",
    "for a zero magnetic field this is equivalent to having symmetric matter . for finite magnetic fields due to the different electrical charge of both quarks and the appearance of landau levels ,",
    "@xmath7 is symmetric only for restricted densities .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ stars ]",
    "the role of the magnetic field effects on quark matter has an importance of its own and it has already been exploited in the literature .",
    "one of the conclusions is that the consequences of landau quantization are not negligible for large values of the magnetic field .",
    "quark matter is generally described by the mit bag model . in this work",
    "we tackle the inclusion of the magnetic field in quark matter described by the su(2 ) version of the njl model , known to have more realist features .    using the standard large-@xmath0 technique",
    "we have evaluated the effective potential for the su(2 ) version of the njl model in 3 + 1 dimensions which has allowed us to obtain its thermodynamical potential at finite density and in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "then , we have reviewed some of the most important well known results related to three different situations : a ) @xmath135 and @xmath63 ( chiral symmetry breaking / restoration ) , b ) @xmath148 and @xmath93 ( magnetic catalysis ) and c ) @xmath135 and @xmath197 ( magnetic induced quark matter stability ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath198 , for magnetized quark matter described by njl su(2 ) model , has a minimum which is lower than the one determined for magnetic free quark matter .",
    "we have also obtained that a magnetic field of the order of @xmath199 g barely affects the effective mass as compared with the results for matter not subjected to the magnetic field and for @xmath200 g matter is totally polarized for chemical potentials below 490 mev . for small values of the magnetic fields",
    "the number of filled ll is large and the quantization effects are washed out , while for large magnetic fields the chiral symmetry restoration occurs for smaller values of the chemical potentials .    in order to introduce @xmath1-equilibrium ,",
    "we have extended the thermodynamical potential so as to consider leptonic contributions .",
    "our numerical results show that , for the su(2 ) case , only very high magnetic fields ( @xmath201 g ) affect the eos in a noticeable way .    while for quark matter in @xmath1-equilibrium , the densities at which the pressure is zero increase with the inclusion of the magnetic field , the opposite happens in matter not subjected to @xmath1-equilibrium .    regarding the tov equation results",
    ", we can see that the su(2 ) version with magnetic field provides masses and radii for the maximum mass stable configuration larger than the analogous magnetic free configuration .",
    "the radii are quite lower than the corresponding one obtained within the magnetic free su(3 ) njl .",
    "this is mainly due to the softness of the su(2 ) eos at the lower densities .",
    "the mass - radius results were obtained with a density dependent magnetic field , which increases from the surface to the interior of the star .",
    "the masses of the maximum mass stable configuration for fields of the order or larger than @xmath202 g are larger than 1.4 @xmath203 , and much larger than the analogous magnetic free configuration , due to the contribution of the magnetic field .",
    "the inclusion of the magnetic field in the su(3 ) version of the njl is not trivial and is currently under way .",
    "we expect to obtain larger results for the radius .",
    "knowing that the effects of the anomalous magnetic moments is very relevant we also intend to take them into account in the next calculations .",
    "an alternative model , usually called pnjl@xcite , can also be investigated in the presence of magnetic fields .",

    "in this appendix we give the results for the main integrals and matsubara sums appearing along the text .",
    "the matsubara sums which are relevant for the different integrals considered in our work can be derived as ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath204\\ ] ] @xmath205/t}\\ } + t \\ln\\{1 + e^{-[e_p-\\mu]/t}\\}\\ ; , \\label{sum1}\\ ] ] which , as @xmath206 , becomes @xmath207\\ ] ] @xmath208 \\theta(\\mu -e_p ) = { \\rm max}(e_p,\\mu ) .",
