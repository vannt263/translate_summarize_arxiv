    "segue 1 was discovered by  @xcite as an overdensity of resolved stars in imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "it is located at equatorial coordinates @xmath1 and has a heliocentric distance of @xmath2 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to galactic coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 and a galactocentric distance of @xmath5 kpc .",
    "@xcite suggested that segue 1 was an extended globular cluster , possibly associated with the sagittarius stream . with its initially determined half - light radius of approximately @xmath6 pc",
    ", it would be amongst the largest milky way globular clusters such as palomar 5 .",
    "the object is also unusually faint ( @xmath7 ) for its size .",
    "segue 1 has some points in common with two other discoveries made with sdss  namely willman 1  @xcite and bootes  ii  @xcite .",
    "all three objects have similar absolute magnitudes and half - light radii , intermediate between the dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which are dark matter dominated , and the globular clusters , which show no evidence for dark matter ( see figure @xmath8 in  @xcite ) . determining the true nature of these three objects is important as it may shed light on the important question of the size of the smallest dark matter haloes in which baryons collapsed to form galaxies .",
    "the interpretation of segue 1 as a globular cluster has recently been contested by  @xcite . using keck / deimos spectroscopy , they measured the radial velocities of 24 stars in segue 1 with a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath9 kms@xmath10 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath11 kms@xmath12 , leading to claims that segue 1 is a dwarf galaxy rather than a globular cluster . assuming these stars are gravitationally bound to segue 1 and are in dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "then the implied mass - to - light ratio is @xmath13  @xcite , which would make segue 1 the most dark matter dominated galaxy detected to date .",
    "however , both assumptions are questionable",
    ". if segue 1 is a globular cluster that is undergoing tidal disruption , then extra - tidal stars may not be so easy to distinguish from gravitationally bound members and the hypothesis of dynamical equilibrium may be a poor one . more seriously ,",
    "if segue 1 is immersed in the sagittarius stream , then contamination of any sample of segue 1 stars by stream stars may be hard to avoid .    in this paper , we analyze sdss and auxiliary canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) photometry of segue 1 .",
    "we use the optimal filter techniques pioneered by @xcite to identify tidal features in  2 and  3 .",
    "a stellar population embedded deep in a massive halo would not be expected to show visible signs of battering by the galactic tides .",
    "we compute segue 1 s structural parameters in  4 . finally ,",
    "in  5 , we extract from the sdss spectral database blue horizontal branch stars and used them to identify the kinematical signal from the sagittarius stream .",
    "we show that contamination of kinematically selected segue 1 stars by sagittarius stream stars is a serious problem , and can lead to artificially inflated velocity dispersions .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that covers one - quarter of the celestial sphere .",
    "the sdss data are described in the data release papers ( adelmann - mccarthy 2008 for the sixth release , dr 6 ) and documented at `` http://www.sdss.org . ''",
    "we select stars in a @xmath14 box centered on segue 1 from sdss dr 6 data , using the sdss clean photometry flags and a magnitude cut ( @xmath15 ) to remove data reduction artifacts from the field .",
    "in addition , we correct for extinction using the maps of @xcite and apply the ubercal correction as described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : density]a shows the density of all stars ( fainter than @xmath16 ) selected by dividing the area in @xmath17 pixels and smoothing the field with a gaussian kernel fwhm of 2 pixels ( this is applied to all density plots in this work ) .",
    "segue 1 is too faint to stand out in this figure .",
    "figure [ fig : density]b shows a density plot of stars that we have removed from the sample using our magnitude cut .",
    "structural artifacts due to problems in data reduction are clearly visible and correspond to the sdss scan patterns on the sky .",
    "figure [ fig : density]c shows our estimate of the field star density with extinction contours overplotted .",
    "the estimate is determined by first replacing segue 1 within @xmath18 with a representative patch of the field star distribution taken at @xmath19 . by a similar cloning method",
    ", we remove the other obvious overdensity in the field , the leo i dwarf galaxy ( @xmath20 , at a galactocentric distance of 250 kpc ) .",
    "we then compute the density and smooth the resulting distribution with a gaussian kernel with a fwhm of 5 pixels and a box - car smoothing over 25 pixels . finally , since classification of galaxies and stars especially at faint magnitudes can be uncertain in the sdss , it is important to verify that possible structures are not influenced by such misclassifications .",
    "figure [ fig : density]d shows that there are no obvious galaxy overdensities in the immediate vicinity of segue 1 .",
    "there does seem to be an underdensity , however , this would not generate spurious tidal structures near segue 1 except in the highly unlikely event that almost all galaxies were misclassified as stars .",
    "the main dataset used in this paper is from the sdss .",
    "however , we also have access to a set of megacam pointings taken on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on 17 - 25th january 2007 .",
    "data were taken in @xmath21 and @xmath22 filters , typically three 200 s exposures using the measured zero - points for megacam .",
    "the megacam @xmath21 and @xmath22 magnitudes are converted to sdss magnitudes by matching the stars in the cfht data to the sdss observations .",
    "we find 21952 matches between the two data sets .",
    "we then plot the difference in magnitudes in the two systems versus cfht color to find the relations @xmath23 there are 10 megacam fields each covering 1 deg@xmath24 , straddling segue 1 at fixed declination . a rectangle bounding the 10 fields is shown in figure  [ fig : density]a .",
    "although deeper than the sdss data by about a magnitude , the cfht data cover considerably less area and are not so useful for diagnosing tidal features . nonetheless , it is the best dataset for estimating the surface brightness profile and hence the structural parameters of segue 1 .",
    ".k - s tests comparing the hess diagrams of different above average signal regions and segue 1 .",
    "a high k - s probability indicates a high confidence that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the number of stars is the count of stars inside the cmd mask in a given box .",
    "the count of sagittarius stars ( i.e. stars falling inside the cmd mask but belonging to the sagittarius stream rather than segue 1 ) is estimated using the methods described in  5.1 .

    "we also show as dotted lines the characteristic velocity distributions of the galactic halo and thick disk to emphasise that the features can not be ascribed to these components .",

    "segue 1 lies in a very busy area of the sky with multiple wraps of the sagittarius stream as well as other debris streams , as shown in the `` field of streams '' ( belokurov et al .",
    "it has been known since the work of ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the sagittarius tidal debris is wrapped around the galaxy a number of times .",
    "there are at least 4 wraps corresponding to two streams , leading and trailing  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a schematic plot is shown in figure  [ fig : rosette ] , in which the orbit of the sagittarius dwarf is integrated for @xmath37 gyr backwards and forwards in time .",
    "segue 1 is located close to an intersection of the trailing and leading arms .",
    "the `` field of streams '' traces the young leading ( a ) and old trailing ( b ) wraps , which are closely matched in distance around the north galactic cap .",
    "simulations suggest the existence of further streams corresponding to old leading and young trailing wraps in the same field of view .",
    "so far , observational evidence for these wraps is sparse .    at the location of segue 1 , the wraps have similar distances and",
    "are composed of similar stars .",
    "the only way to identify them is through their different kinematics . to this end",
    ", we interrogate the sdss spectral database to pick out blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : selection ] shows the bhb branch of m92 with an enclosed box , which is used for selection in @xmath38 versus @xmath39 . to eliminate false positives",
    ", we simultaneously impose the cut @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "this box selects bhb stars at the approximate distance of segue 1 .",
    "our rationale is to trace with bhbs a slice through the sagittarius stream at constant right ascension ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "any features that stand out in the same range of declination can be attributed to the sagittarius stream .",
    "the right panel tells us what this range of declination is .",
    "the density of turn - off stars is shown as the uppermost solid line , with the turn - off stars selected via the mask shown in the left panel .",
    "the mask is wide enough to include all stars ( 22 , excluding 2 bhbs ) in the spectroscopically confirmed sample of @xcite .",
    "although the mask is centered on the cmd of segue 1 , because of its width , it will also pick out stars in the sagittarius stream .    to make sagittarius stand out more clearly",
    ", we subtract the galactic foreground .",
    "the number density of sagittarius stars depends on the model adopted for the foreground . in one method",
    ", we take advantage of the apparent linearity of the foreground ( shown as a dotted line ) .",
    "once subtracted , this gives the lower dashed profile , which peaks at @xmath42 stars per deg@xmath43 .",
    "however , at low declinations , the fit could be in error due to a contribution from the `` virgo overdensity ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) . as an alternative",
    ", we examine the density of stars at the same galactic latitude but with the sign of longitude reversed .",
    "this results in a lower foreground estimate and a higher peak density for the sagittarius of @xmath44 stars per deg@xmath45 .",
    "the sagittarius stream is limited to declinations satisfying @xmath46 .    figure  [ fig : signal ] shows the distribution of bhb stars in the plane of radial velocity versus declination . once the gradients due to the projection of the local standard of rest have been removed , the two overdensities coincident with the sagittarius stream in declination stand out at @xmath47 kms@xmath12 and @xmath36 kms@xmath12 . at this location , it is unlikely that these features can be due to the galactic thick disk or halo , as evidenced by the velocity histograms in the lower panel . in fact , they nicely match the velocities of the wraps of the sagittarius stream at this location shown in figure  3 of fellhauer et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "segue 1 is in the sagittarius stream and appears to be moving with the same velocity as one its wraps . in the lower panels in figure  [ fig : signal ] , we show gaussian fits to each of the overdensities associated with sagittarius .",
    "the dispersions are @xmath48 kms@xmath12 . assuming typical radial velocity errors of @xmath49 kms@xmath12",
    "gives the intrinsic dispersion in each wrap to be @xmath50 kms@xmath12 .",
    "of course , this is approximate , as both measured dispersion and the errors could be somewhat larger .",
    "this has immediate consequences for estimates of the velocity dispersion of segue  1 , as the problem of contamination by sagittarius stream stars is substantial .",
    "let us estimate the number of sagittarius stars in the sample of  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : selection ] , our mask already wraps around the candidate stars of geha et al .",
    "hence , the total number of sagittarius stars at the location of segue  1 can be read off the dashed curve in the right - hand panel .",
    "it is between @xmath51 and @xmath52 stars per deg@xmath53 depending on the model adopted for foreground subtraction . to estimate how many of these move with @xmath54 kms@xmath12 , we note that the two velocity peaks in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : signal ] integrate to roughly the same numbers of stars",
    "so , allowing a factor of 0.5 to to account for the fact that both leading and trailing arm stars occur at this location and scaling to the @xmath55 deg@xmath53 field of view used by geha et al , we estimate that the final contamination in their sample is at least @xmath51 stars deg@xmath56",
    "@xmath57 deg@xmath53 , which comes to 4 stars .",
    "this might be raised as high as 8 stars , if the lower value for the foreground is adopted .",
    "we caution that such estimates necessarily involve extrapolation from comparatively small numbers of bhbs .",
    "could contaminating stars be responsible for the high velocity dispersion of @xmath58 kms@xmath12 reported by  @xcite ?",
    "figure  [ fig : mc ] shows the results of monte carlo simulations to gauge the importance of this contamination .",
    "the sagittarius stream stars are assumed to have a velocity dispersion of @xmath59 kms@xmath12 and segue  1 stars to have a velocity dispersion of @xmath60 kms@xmath12 ( typical for a globular cluster ) . in the simulations , samples of 24 stars",
    "are generated , with the number of contaminating sagittarius stream stars allowed to vary between 0 and 10 .",
    "the simulations are run for 10000 iterations .",
    "the points on the plot are the average dispersion measured in the 10000 samples of 24 stars and the error bars represent the spread .",
    "the number of contaminating sagittarius stars required to inflate the velocity dispersion from its true value ( in the simulation ) of @xmath60 kms@xmath12 to the value reported by geha et al is surprisingly small  perhaps even one contaminating star is enough ! recall that we estimate the actual number of contaminants in the geha et al sample is probably between 4 and 8 .",
    "although the kinematic selection of geha et al is sufficient to exclude stars from one of the wraps of the sagittarius , it is not sufficient to exclude stars from the wrap moving with @xmath61 kms@xmath12 .",
    "a very modest contamination from this wrap can cause an anomalously high velocity dispersion to be reported .          assuming that segue 1 is on a sagittarius - like orbit , its radial and tangential velocities are sufficiently well constrained to ask what effect galactic tides would have on the object .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbit_info ] shows the results of orbit integrations , in which a test particle is placed at the location of segue 1 with a variety of initial velocities .",
    "the particle travels through the milky way potential as defined in fellhauer et al . (",
    "2006 ) for roughly 2 periods .",
    "we then measure the perigalactic distance of the orbit as well as its eccentricity .",
    "the contours show the regions in which the points lie in the plane of perigalactic distance and eccentricity .",
    "we then calculate the tidal radius for a cluster of mass @xmath62 travelling on such an orbit using  @xcite @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the perigalactic distance , @xmath65 is the eccentricity , and @xmath66 is the mass of the galaxy interior to @xmath64 . in both panels of the figure , the radial velocity is @xmath67 kms@xmath12 ( heliocentric ) or 118 kms@xmath12 ( galactocentric ) .",
    "but , panel ( a ) shows the results with initial tangential velocities corresponding to a typical galactic range ( @xmath68 kms@xmath12 to @xmath69 kms@xmath12 ) , and with cluster masses of @xmath70 and m=@xmath71 .",
    "panel ( b ) assumes the tangential velocity is chosen to correspond approximately to that of the old leading arm 215 kms@xmath12 galactocentric ) .    from both panels",
    ", we find that if segue 1 is a globular cluster with mass around @xmath72 , then its tidal radius would be smaller than its observed half - light radius which implies that it could not survive on such an orbit for long and would be in the throes of destruction .",
    "if segue 1 is a dwarf galaxy with mass of @xmath71 , the estimated tidal radius is much larger than the measured half - light radius and we would not expect to see any signs of tidal disruption",
    "the distinction between star clusters and dwarf galaxies is largely based on size .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath73 difference in the characteristic sizes of clusters and galaxies . despite differences in the velocity dispersion ,",
    "this translates into an order of magnitude difference in the estimated mass - to - light ratios , under the assumption of virial equilibrium .",
    "the example of pal 5 shows the dangers of assuming virial equilibrium .",
    "pal 5 has a half - light radius of @xmath48 pc , one of the largest of the milky way globular clusters .",
    "it is also well - known to be disintegrating under the galactic tidal field , and so its half - light radius exceeds its tidal radius .",
    "the most distant stars are therefore already unbound and belong properly speaking to pal 5 s tidal tails .",
    "the assumption of virial equilibrium would lead to a mass - to - light ratio that is in serious error .",
    "as noted by dehnen ( 2004 ) , the final disruption of pal 5 happens very quickly , and most mass is lost during the final few percent of its lifetime .",
    "another example of a dissolving milky way satellite is provided by ursa major ii ( uma  ii ) . in the model of fellhauer",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) , the orbit of uma  ii has pericentric and apocentric distance similar to that of the sagittarius .",
    "the fate of uma  ii is very similar to that of pal 5 , but the final disruption happens on a longer timescale , comparable to the orbital period of 1 gyr ( see figure 6 of fellhauer et al .",
    "suppose we were to observe pal 5 or uma  ii at a future time equal to a fraction of their orbital period .",
    "then , just a few faint stars will mark the nucleus , whilst any streams will become blurred and of lower contrast as they diffuse in the milky way potential .",
    "in other words , we will see something like segue 1 .    of course",
    ", to prove the hypothesis of extra - tidal stars for segue 1 , what is needed is wide - field kinematical data . at the moment ,",
    "the only published study is by @xcite .",
    "they measured the radial velocities of 24 stars and concluded that segue 1 has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath9 kms@xmath10 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath74 kms@xmath12 .",
    "the systemic velocity therefore coincides with both the predicted velocity of the sagittarius stream  @xcite and the measured velocity as recorded in this paper .",
    "this not only strengthens the argument that segue 1 is a star cluster , originating from the sagittarius , but also raises the question of the levels of contamination in kinematically selected datasets around segue 1 s location .",
    "in particular , such contaminants may be inflating the velocity dispersion , and hence the inferred mass - to - light ratio , of segue  1 .",
    "taking advantage of the wide field of view of the anglo - australian telescope/ aaomega fiber - fed spectrograph combination  , gilmore and collaborators have observed a @xmath75 area around segue  1 .",
    "observing parameters were the same as those for the related study of bootes  1 ( see norris et al .",
    "targets are selected from the sdss photometric data to be broadly consistent with the segue 1 cmd published by belokurov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and a radial velocity accuracy of @xmath76 kms@xmath12 is attained . analysis of this dataset is ongoing and will be presented elsewhere . here ,",
    "we are primarily concerned with existence of extratidal stars .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : aat ] shows the dataset plotted in the plane of heliocentric radial velocity and angular distance from segue 1 .",
    "applying a kinematic cut of @xmath77 kms@xmath12 picks out the 8 likely members , which are reasonably well separated from the galactic foreground populations .",
    "the right panel shows the location of the likely members as compared to the density distribution inferred from the optimal filter .",
    "not only do the candidates extend well beyond the half - light radius marked by the thin circle , but they also follow in broad outline the distribution suggested by the photometric analysis .",
    "this confirms the wide spatial distribution of stars with kinematics like segue 1 in this field .",
    "accordingly , we favour the scenario in which segue 1 is a star cluster stripped early on from the sagittarius galaxy .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the fact that all four of the phase space coordinates that are measured coincide with those of the sagittarius stream .",
    "what is needed to make the argument complete is a demonstration that the metallicity of segue 1 is compatible with an origin in the sagittarius galaxy .",
    "@xcite measured the metallicity of one star as [ fe / h ] = -3.3 , and the metallicity of a further 13 as [ fe / h ] = -1.8 .",
    "the latter is consistent with the metallicity of sagittarius .",
    "the former is very surprising , as there are no sagittarius clusters with a metallicity lower than -2.2 .",
    "however , the declination and radial velocity of segue 1 place it in the very oldest wrap of material , and so it must have been stripped first and have resided in the very outskirts of the sagittarius progenitor .",
    "this could explain variations in the metallicity of segue 1 and other parts of the sagittarius stream .",
    "regardless of whether the metal - poor star of @xcite is a member of segue 1 or not , it signifies the detection of a substantial metallicity gradient in the sagittarius progenitor , although this is more extreme than has been measured so far  @xcite . in any case , the claimed status of segue 1 as the least luminous galaxy is very uncertain .",
