    "the standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) approach to model the universe begins with two basic assumptions .",
    "first , it is assumed that our @xmath2dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic at sufficiently large scales .",
    "second , it is also assumed the weyl s principle , that ensures the existence of a cosmic time @xmath3 .",
    "the most general spacetime metric consistent with these assumptions is @xmath4,\\ ] ] where ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the cosmological scale factor , and we have set the speed of light @xmath7 .",
    "the metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) only expresses the above assumptions , and to proceed further in this geometrical approach to model the physical world , one needs a metrical theory of gravitation as , e.g. , general relativity ( which we assume in this work ) to study the dynamics of the universe .",
    "these very general assumptions imply that the cosmological fluid is necessarily of a perfect - fluid type , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fluid four - velocity , with total density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 given , respectively , by @xmath12\\ ; , \\label{rho - eq } \\\\ p & = & - \\frac{1}{8\\pi g}\\left[\\ , 2\\,\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a } + \\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2 } + \\frac{k}{a^2 } \\,\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{p - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and dots denote derivative with respect to the time @xmath3 .    without assuming any particular equation of state",
    ", one can proceed even further in this approach to model the universe by invoking the so - called _ energy conditions _  @xcite that limit the energy - momentum tensor on physical grounds .    in the flrw context , where only the energy - momentum of a perfect fluid  ( [ em - tensor ] )",
    "should be considered , these conditions take one of the forms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath13 where nec , wec , sec and dec correspond , respectively , to the null , weak , strong and dominant energy conditions . from eqs .",
    "( [ rho - eq ] )    ( [ p - eq ] ) , one has that these energy conditions can be recast as a set of differential constraints involving the scale factor @xmath14 and its derivatives for any spatial curvature @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 \\leq \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a }   \\leq \\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2}+\\frac{k}{a^2 } \\;.",
    "\\label{dec - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where from the above nec / wec inequations  ( [ ec ] ) , the nec restriction [ eq .  ( [ nec - eq ] ) ] is also part of both wec and nec constraints .",
    "a further step in this flrw approach is to confront the energy condition predictions with the observations . in this regard , since the pioneering works by visser  @xcite , it has been shown that in the flrw framework the energy conditions provide model - independent bounds on the cosmological observables , and an increasing number of analyses involving such bounds have been discussed in the recent literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , we have studied the behavior of the distance modulus to cosmic sources for any spatial curvature and confronted these bound predictions with current type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by assuming a flat ( @xmath17 universe and that only the dark energy component obeys the wec , it was derived upper limits on the matter density parameter @xmath18 .",
    "more recently , the confrontation of the nec and sec bounds with a combined sample of 192 supernovae was carried out providing similar and complementary results  @xcite .",
    "energy conditions constraints on alternative gravity models , such as the so - called @xmath19-gravity , have also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also@xcite for other analyses ) .    in this paper , to shed some additional light on the interrelation between energy conditions and observational data , we extend and complement our previous results  @xcite in two different ways .",
    "first , we derive model - independent energy - conditions bounds on the lookback time - redshift relation @xmath20 in an expanding flrw universe for any spatial curvature @xmath21 .",
    "second , by assuming the total age of the universe to be @xmath22 gyr , as given by current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurement  @xcite , we transform the age estimates of 32 galaxies , as provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , into lookback time observations and concretely confront these data with the energy conditions bound predictions . similarly to our previous studies , we find that all energy conditions seem to have been violated at some point of the cosmic evolution .",
    "the lookback time @xmath23 is defined as the elapsed time between the present age of the universe ( @xmath24 ) and the time @xmath25 , when the light from a cosmic source at a particular redshift @xmath26 was emitted . in the context of the flrw models it is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the subscript 0 denotes present - day quantities .    before deriving the bounds from energy conditions on the lookback time - redshift relation , we shall discuss how the lookback time @xmath20 can be recast in a suitable form to confront with observational data .",
    "to this end , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we first note that the age @xmath29 of a cosmic source ( a galaxy or a quasar , for example ) at redshift @xmath26 is the difference between the age of the universe at @xmath26 and its age when the galaxy was born ( at @xmath30 ) , which in turn can be written in terms of the lookback time as @xmath31 from this expression it is straightforward to show that the observed lookback time of a cosmic source at @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the present estimated age of the universe and @xmath35 stands for the _ incubation time _ or _ delay factor _ , which accounts for our ignorance about the formation redshift @xmath30 of the source .",
    "* a. bound from the nec / wec *    in order to obtain the bounds from the nec / wec on the lookback time @xmath20 , we note that for all @xmath36 the first integral of eq .",
    "( [ nec - eq ] ) gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the current values of the curvature and hubble parameters .",
    "now , making use of this inequality , we integrate  ( [ lookbacktime ] ) to obtain the following upper bound for the lookback time :    @xmath40^{1/2 } } \\right ]     - \\ln \\left ( \\frac { \\sqrt{1-\\omega_k } } { 1 + \\sqrt{1-\\omega_k } } \\right ) \\right\\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which , for @xmath41 , reduces to @xmath42 concerning the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ nec - wec - bound ] ) , some words of clarification are in order here : first , that we have incorporated the constraint @xmath43 that arises from the wec , as given by eq .",
    "( [ wec - eq ] ) ; second , by requiring the argument of the square root in the first logarithmic term to be positive we restrict our analysis of a spatially closed geometry ( @xmath44 ) to redshifts lying in the interval @xmath45 .",
    "note , however , that given the current estimates of the curvature parameter from wmap and other experiments , i.e. , @xmath46  @xcite , the above interval leads to @xmath47 , which covers the entire range of galaxy observations ( @xmath48 ) we shall be concerned with in our analysis .",
    "clearly , if the nec / wec are obeyed , then @xmath20 must take values such that eq .",
    "( [ nec - wec - bound ] ) holds .",
    "the three curves at the top of fig .",
    "1(a ) illustrate the nec / wec bounds on the lookback time @xmath23 as a function of the redshift @xmath26 for different signs of the curvature parameter @xmath49 .",
    "to plot this curves we have used the central value of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) key project estimate , i.e. , @xmath50 @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "* b. bound from the sec *    similarly to the nec / wec case , the first integral of eq .",
    "( [ sec - eq ] ) clearly gives @xmath52 for all @xmath36 .",
    "the above inequality along with equation  ( [ lookbacktime ] ) furnishes @xmath53 which , differently from the nec / wec case , holds regardless of the value of the curvature parameters @xmath49 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line of fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the upper bound for the sec - fulfillment prediction [ eq . ( [ sec - bound ] ) ] as a function of the redshift for different values of the hubble parameters .    *",
    "c. bounds from the dec *    from inequation  ( [ dec - eq ] ) the dec provides upper and lower bounds on the rate of expansion @xmath54 , and therefore gives rise to two associated bounds on the lookback time @xmath20 .",
    "inequations  ( [ nec - eq ] ) and  ( [ wec - eq ] ) along with  ( [ dec - eq ] ) make apparent that the dec upper bound coincides with the nec / wec bound given by eqs .",
    "( [ nec - wec - bound ] ) and ( [ necflat ] ) .",
    "now , in order to set the lower bound from the dec , we integrate both sides of the first inequality  ( [ dec - eq ] ) to obtain @xmath55 inserting this inequality into the expression  ( [ lookbacktime ] ) we obtain the following lower bound for the non - flat ( @xmath56 ) flrw models : @xmath57 where the @xmath58 sign corresponds , respectively , to values of @xmath59 , @xmath60^{1/4}$ ] is a new variable , and the upper limit of integration is @xmath61^{1/4}$ ] .",

    "note also that , for the flat case ( @xmath62 ) , eq .",

    ", it is worth emphasizing that , differently from the case of the distance modulus @xmath65 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the energy conditions predicted bounds on the lookback time @xmath20 depends strongly on the value adopted for the hubble parametercdm model , the age of the universe can be approximated by @xmath66 gyr , where @xmath18 is the matter density parameter .",
    "the error propagation in the determination of @xmath24 , @xmath67 , clearly shows that the fractional error in @xmath68 is three times more important than the fractional error in @xmath18  @xcite . ] . to illustrate this point ,",

    "similar conclusions also apply to the nec / wec and dec lookback time predictions .",
    "we use age estimates of 32 galaxies ranging from @xmath0 , as recently analized in ref .",
    "this sample includes objects from the recently released gemini deep deep survey ( gdds )  @xcite , archival data  @xcite and the two prototypical evolved red galaxies lbds 59w091 and lbds 59w069 @xcite , whose cosmological impications have been largely discussed in the literature  @xcite ( see  @xcite for more details ) .    in order to build up our lookback time sample , we combine the ages of the above galaxy sample with estimates of the total age of the universe @xmath34 , according to eq .",
    "( [ tauobserved ] ) . here , we assume @xmath75 , as provided by a joint analysis involving current cmb and large - scale structure experiments ( wmap , cbi , acbar and 2dfgrs )  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the last step toward our lookback time sample concerns the delay factor @xmath35 [ the third term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ tauobserved ] ) ] . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , the most likely star formation history for this galaxy sample is that of a single burst of duration less than @xmath76 gyr , although in some cases the duration of the burst is consistent with @xmath77 gyr , which means that the galaxies have been evolving passively since their initial burst of star formation .",
    "in the subsequent analyses , to check the influence of @xmath35 on our results , we assume following two values for this quantity : @xmath78 gyr and @xmath79 gyr .      in figs .",
    "( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) we confront the energy conditions predictions for @xmath20 with current lookback time observations for values of the hubble parameter lying in the interval @xmath70 @xmath51 and @xmath80 , which corresponds to the central value of the estimates provided by current cmb experiments  @xcite .      figure  2(a ) shows the upper and lower - bound @xmath20 curves for the nec / wec and dec - upper bound fulfillment with @xmath78 gyr . similarly to the results involving current sne ia observations  @xcite , an interesting aspect of these two panels is that they indicate that these energy conditions may have been violated at @xmath81 irrespective of the value of @xmath68 in the above 1@xmath82 interval .",
    "a clear example of such violation is given by the galaxies at @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , while their observed lookback time are @xmath85 gyr and @xmath86 gyr , the upper - bound nec / wec  fulfillment prediction for the corresponding redshifts are given , respectively , by @xmath87 gyr and @xmath88 gyr for @xmath50 @xmath51 ; and @xmath89 gyr and @xmath90 for @xmath91 @xmath51 . by considering the central value of _ hst",

    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) ] in the entire interval of @xmath68 considered in this paper . ]",
    "similar conclusions for the nec / wec and dec ( upper bound ) are also obtained when a delay factor of 0.5 gyr is considered in our analysis [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . in this case , however , a clear evidence for violation of the nec / wec and dec ( upper - bound ) conditions is possible only for values of @xmath94 @xmath51 . for @xmath50 @xmath51 , e.g. ,",
    "the difference between the observed values of the lookback time and the nec / wec / dec prediction at @xmath83 , for instance , is of 1.32 gyr or , equivalently , @xmath95 .    concerning the above results , some interesting aspects are worth mentioning at this point .",
    "first , similarly to the results involving current sne ia observations  @xcite , all the above results holds only for the upper - bound of the dec predictions , and the lower - bound of dec is not violated by these lookback time data .",
    "second , again similarly to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , the above analysis is very insensitive to the values of the curvature parameter so that all the above conclusions remain unchanged for values of @xmath49 within the interval provided by the current cmb experiments , i.e. , @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "limit given by wmap , i.e. , @xmath96 , the nec / wec predicted lookback time at @xmath97 ranges ( for @xmath50 @xmath51 ) between @xmath98 gyr and @xmath99 gyr , respectively , which corresponds to a difference of @xmath100 third , although our analyses and results are model - independent , in the context of a flrw model with a dark energy component parameterized by an equation of state @xmath101 , violation of nec / wec and dec is associated with the existence of the so - called _ phantom _ fields ( @xmath102 ) , an idea that has been largely explored in the current literature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , by assuming this standard framework , the above results seem to indicate a possible dominion of these fields over the conventional matter fields very recently , for @xmath81 .",
    "the upper - bound @xmath20 curves for the sec - fulfillment are shown in figs .",
    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) for different values of the hubble parameter . for @xmath78 gyr [ fig .",
    "( 3a ) ] and @xmath68 in the 1@xmath82 interval given by the _ hst _ key project  @xcite , sec seems to be violated in the entire redshift range , without a single galaxy in agreement with the theoretical upper - bound sec prediction .",
    "such an outcome is in agreement with both the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the sne ia analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , although in this latter analysis the first clear evidence for sec violation happens only at @xmath103 .",
    "interestingly , a better concordance with these sne ia results is possible when the hubble parameter is fixed at @xmath104 @xmath51 , as recently advocated by sandage and collaborators  @xcite [ the upper curve in figs .",
    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) ] . for the central value of _ hst _ key project ,",
    "the discrepancy between the observed value and the sec - fulfillment prediction value , e.g. at @xmath105 , is as large as @xmath106 gyr .",
    "this means that , for @xmath78 gyr and by considering the hubble parameter within the current accepted interval , even at very high redshifts , i.e. , @xmath107 , when the universe is expected to be dominated by normal matter , all the lookback time estimates discussed here are at least @xmath69 higher than the theoretical value derived from eq .",
    "( [ sec - bound ] ) .",
    "a slightly different conclusion is obtained by considering a delay factor of @xmath108 gyr [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] . in this case ,",
    "an interval of concordance between the sec prediction and the observational data is possible for @xmath109 @xmath51 , which corresponds to the 1@xmath82 lower bound of the _ hst _ key project measurements .",
    "for its central value , however , although reduced relative to the previous case ( @xmath78 gyr ) , the discrepancy between the prediction and observed values for the entire interval of redshift is still considerable .",
    "in this work , by using the fact that the classical energy conditions can be recast as a set of differential constraints involving the scale factor @xmath14 and its derivatives , we have extended and complemented our previous results  @xcite by deriving model - independent bounds on the lookback time - redshift relation and confronted them with the sample of lookback time measurements discussed in section iii .",
    "although the predicted bounds on @xmath20 depend upon the adopted values for the hubble parameter , we have shown that , similarly to the results involving sne ia observations  @xcite , all the energy conditions seems to have been violated in recent past of cosmic evolution for the current estimated values of @xmath68  @xcite and the value of the curvature parameter in the interval @xmath46",
    ". an important outcome of our analyses is that , for the above @xmath68 and @xmath49 intervals , the sec , whose violation in a flrw expanding model is closely related to the accelerating expansion of the universe , seems to have been violated in the entire redshift range of the galaxy sample , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "another interesting aspect related to this sec violation is that there seem to be a better concordance of the @xmath20 and the sne ia results  @xcite for lower values of the hubble parameter as , e.g , the one recently advocated by sandage _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that in agreement with our previous analysis  @xcite and other recent recent studies  @xcite , the results reported in this work reinforce the idea that , in the context of the standard cosmology , no possible combination of _ normal _ matter is capable of fitting the current observational data .",
