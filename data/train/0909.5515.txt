    "fermion determinants in the background of certain nontrivial gauge fields play some important roles in connection with various quantum field - theoretic studies , but they are notoriously difficult to calculate analytically . at the heart of the problem",
    "lies the fact that this requires the knowledge on the spectral shifts for given partial differential operators with the introduction of background fields .",
    "but , for partial differential operators which are completely separable ( as would be the case with generic radially - symmetric background fields ) , it has become possible to evaluate the corresponding functional determinants numerically with high precision . see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for a particularly efficient method developed recently by us ( with g. dunne ) .",
    "our method , which is really a combination of analytic and numerical schemes , was first used to compute the qcd instanton determinant for an arbitrary value of quark mass @xcite .",
    "then , applications to other cases involving more general classes of radial background fields were also made @xcite .",
    "the single - instanton determinant due to a quark field of mass @xmath0 is essentially a function of @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the instanton size ( as the dependence on the renormalization mass scale @xmath11 can easily be separated ) . aside from finding the precise numerical value for the determinant for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it will then certainly be desirable , for practical physics applications for instance , to have an explicit ( analytic ) function form for the quantity in some limiting cases at least . for large @xmath4",
    "a systematic large mass expansion @xcite ( accounted for most simply by using the heat - kernel expansion ) provides such analytic formula , and for @xmath12 this formula was shown to be a good representation of our numerically determined results .",
    "more interesting is the small @xmath4-limit , as instanton effects are believed to be important for light quarks especially .",
    "t hooft , in a classic paper @xcite , first obtained the analytic expression appropriate to the @xmath13 limit of the determinant and the result of @xcite , being essentially exact for all @xmath4 values , is of course consistent with his expression .",
    "but , as we increase the value of @xmath4 from zero , a small discrepancy was observed between the numerical result of @xcite and the formula based on the small - mass expansion of the determinant @xcite given in earlier literatures . as the latter expansion ( utilizing the known exact massless particle propagator @xcite in the instanton background ) required rather delicate manipulation for certain integrals appearing due to the infrared problem , we had naturally our suspiction on this small - mass expansion .",
    "we thus decided to develop an entirely new approach for the small - mass behavior of the instanton determinant , which is the present work . here",
    "we not only go beyond the previous finding but also introduce a new method which should have useful application in dealing with other related problems .",
    "our new small - mass expansion formula is now fully consistent with the numerical result of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss small - mass behaviors of the instanton determinant within the general strategy of ref .",

    "( i.e. , valid over the entire radial range ) solutions to the gelfand - yaglom initial - value problems of sturm - liouville - type differential equations @xcite .",
    "so the nontrivial part of our analysis concerns the development of globally - valid small - mass perturbation theory for the solution of the gelfand - yaglom initial value problem . in view of the presence of two characteristic length scales ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath14 , we here find such globally - valid approximation by combining one perturbative solution valid in the radial range @xmath15 ( here , @xmath16 can be any value satisfying the condition @xmath17 ) with another perturbative development valid in the asymptotic range @xmath18 , through an appropriate _ matching _ procedure .",

    "because of a hidden supersymmetry @xcite , the spinor dirac operator in an su(2 ) single instanton field @xcite @xmath20 has the same spectrum ( except for zero modes and an overall multiplicity factor of 4 ) as the corresponding scalar klein - gordon operator .",
    "therefore the one - loop effective action , i.e. , minus the logarithm of the functional determinant for a dirac spinor field of mass @xmath0 ( and isospin @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , is directly related to the corresponding scalar effective action @xmath23 ( for a complex scalar of mass @xmath0 and isospin @xmath21 ) by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath11 is the renormalization scale .",
