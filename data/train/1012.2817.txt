    "satellite @xcite has uncovered a large number of new or previously poorly studied `` igr '' sources @xcite .",
    "while _ integral _ excels at detecting sources in the 2050  kev band , it only localizes the sources to @xmath8@xmath9 , requiring follow - up observations with other x - ray satellites to obtain secure optical or ir counterparts , allowing for a determination of the nature of the sources @xcite .    as more and more of these sources have been identified , possibly the biggest surprise is the large number of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) as well as the properties of these systems .",
    "many of the dozens of _ integral _ hmxbs @xcite have large levels of intrinsic absorption with @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these are commonly called obscured hmxbs . in many cases , it appears that this is due to the compact object being embedded in a strong stellar wind @xcite .",
    "some members of the group of _ integral _ hmxbs exhibit other extreme properties , including the high amplitude x - ray flaring of the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or long - period pulsations from very slowly rotating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "_ integral _ observations have also led to the addition of more hmxbs in the be x - ray binary class @xcite . the optical flux from these systems",
    "is dominated by an early - type star with emission lines from a circumstellar disk . in most cases ,",
    "transient x - ray emission demonstrates the binary nature of the system as eccentric orbits lead to periodic x - ray outbursts when the compact object approaches periastron . of the 64 known",
    "be x - ray binary systems , x - ray pulsations indicate the presence of a neutron star in 42 cases , and the compact object type is unknown for the remaining systems @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting properties of this class is the observed correlation between the orbital period and the spin period of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "igr  j01363 + 6610 has been tentatively classified as a be x - ray binary .",
    "the source was discovered during _ integral _ observations on 2004 april 19 but was not detected @xmath122 weeks later , indicating that the source is transient @xcite .",
    "the peak flux observed from the source was 17 mcrab ( @xmath12@xmath13 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ) in the 1745  kev band and 9 mcrab ( @xmath12@xmath14 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ) in the 815  kev band @xcite .",
    "the 3-@xmath15 upper limit in the 1745  kev band 2 weeks later was @xmath611 mcrab @xcite , and the source has not been detected in other _",
    "integral _ observations even though 2.3  ms of _ integral _ time have been accumulated at the position of this source @xcite .",
    "reports of non - detection include both detailed studies of the cassiopeia region @xcite and catalogs indicating that the source was only detected during the discovery outburst in 2004 @xcite .",
    "although the _ integral _ position uncertainty of @xmath16 leaves a large error region , a be star was found within the error circle using narrow - band h@xmath17 imaging and follow - up optical spectroscopy , and it has been suggested to be the likely counterpart @xcite . however , a sensitive x - ray observation taken with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in 2007 failed to detect the be star @xcite . at the 2  kpc distance estimated for the be star @xcite , the non - detection implies an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of @xmath6@xmath18 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2 @xcite , which is lower than quiescent luminosities for other be x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "this luminosity approaches the level that has been seen during quiescent periods from transient low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) due to thermal emission from the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "although neutron stars in hmxbs might not be heated to the high levels seen for lmxbs , it is interesting that these observations probe this luminosity regime .",
    "currently , there are significant uncertainties about the nature of igr  j01363 + 6610 .",
    "while we know that it is an x - ray transient , and the hard x - ray emission makes it likely that it is a binary ( although its orbital period is unknown ) , the _ chandra _ non - detection makes it unclear whether it is really a be x - ray binary .",
    "finding a be star in the relatively large _ integral _ error circle is not convincing because be stars are more commonly found as single stars rather than being part of a binary system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can not be certain that the compact object in the system is a neutron star since pulsations have not been detected .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a second sensitive x - ray observation of the igr  j01363 + 6610 field with _ xmm - newton _ along with optical spectroscopy of the be star as well as other x - ray sources with optical counterparts in the field . with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , we confirm that the be star is an x - ray source .",
    "we also re - analyze the _",
    "observation and discuss the 2007 results in the context of the new information from _ xmm - newton_.",
    "we observed the igr  j01363 + 6610 field with _ xmm - newton _ on 2009 july 31 from 14.4  h to 22.3  h ut . the observation ( obsid 0603850101 ) occurred during _ xmm - newton _ revolution 1766 .",
    "the epic pn , mos1 , and mos2 instruments @xcite were all operated in full frame mode with a medium filter .",
    "we used the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas-10.0.0 ) package to process the raw data files .",
    "we used the sas tool cifbuild to obtain the necessary `` current calibration files '' for the observation .",
    "then , we reprocessed the pn , mos1 , and mos2 data using epproc and emproc , yielding photon event lists for the three instruments .",
    "although proton flares sometimes cause portions of _ xmm - newton _ observations to have very high backgrounds , we did not find evidence for proton flares , and we were able to use the full exposure time .",
    "we also used an observation of the igr  j01363 + 6610 field made by the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the observation ( obsid 7533 ) , which had an exposure time of 4,976  s , was made on 2007 june 8 .",
    "we used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the aimpoint was placed on the acis - s3 chip . the 90% confidence _",
    "integral _ error circle for igr  j01363 + 6610 @xcite is contained on the acis - s3 and acis - s4 chips .",
    "results of the observation were previously reported in @xcite , and the procedures used for data reduction are described in that work .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations were made with the boller & chivens ccd spectrograph on the 2.4  m hiltner telescope of the mdm observatory on 2009 august 23 ut .",
    "conditions were clear , but with high humidity .",
    "the 150 g / mm grating , blazed at 4700   , was used with a 1@xmath19 wide slit , which gave a wavelength coverage of 3700@xmath207360   at 7.6   resolution .",
    "spectra of six stars coinciding with x - ray sources in the field of igr  j01363 + 6610 were obtained , each with an exposure time of 120  s. of these , three are inside the refined _ integral _ error circle and are presented here .",
    "spectral reduction was performed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "flux calibration used @xcite standard stars , although the spectrophotometry is not expected to be accurate because of the narrow slit .",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _ analysis , we used the sas tool edetect_chain to search for sources in the @xmath1230@xmath21 diameter field - of - view ( fov ) of the mos1 and mos2 instruments , and included photons in the 0.110  kev energy band .",
    "all seven of the mos2 ccds were operational , but , for mos1 , ccd#6 was not active because it was switched off after an anomaly that occurred in 2005 .",
    "while this means that some of the mos2 fov is not covered by mos1 , the central ccd , which includes the entire _ integral _ error circle , is covered by both mos units .",
    "we found a total of 21 sources , including 14 detected by both mos units and seven detected by mos2 in the part of the fov that mos1 did not cover .",
    "we determined the number of counts for each source using @xmath22 radius apertures and subtracted the background using circular apertures of the same size in 16 source - free regions of the detector .",
    "the mean number of background counts per aperture is @xmath23 for mos1 and @xmath24 for mos2 ( in 28,180  s of exposure time ) .",
    "the sources range in brightness from @xmath25 to @xmath26 counts ( both of these sources are in the region covered only by mos2 ) .",
    "five of the sources are in the @xmath16 _ integral _ 90% confidence error circle for igr  j01363 + 6610 given in @xcite .",
    "these five sources include the second brightest source in the field ( @xmath27 counts ) as well as sources with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 counts , where these numbers of counts are averages of the two mos detectors .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ source names and positions are given in table  [ tab : xmmsources ] .",
    "in addition to mos1 and mos2 , we also determined the position measured by the pn instrument for each source , and we report the average position measured by the three instruments ( except for xmmu  j013632.4 + 660924 , which fell between two pn ccd chips ) . in averaging the positions , we weighted each measurement by its statistical uncertainty . in table",
    "[ tab : xmmsources ] , we also report the overall 90% confidence position uncertainties , and , in each case , the error is dominated by the systematic pointing uncertainty of @xmath32 , and we have multiplied this by 1.7 to obtain the 90% confidence value . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using the 2007 observation of the field by _ chandra _ , we previously reported three sources in the _ integral _ error circle @xcite . however , in the most recent _ integral _ source catalog @xcite , the best estimate of the igr  j01363 + 6610 position has shifted by @xmath33 relative to the value used in @xcite , and a fourth _ chandra _ source , cxou  j013644.5 + 661301 , is now also consistent with the _ integral _ position for igr  j01363 + 6610 , and its _ chandra _ position is r.a .",

    "the fact that we have now conclusively shown that the be star is a transient x - ray source and that none of the other fainter x - ray sources in the _ integral _ error circle have optical properties that would be expected of a hard x - ray source strengthens the association between the be star and igr  j01363 + 6610 , and we focus exclusively on the x - ray properties of the be star xmmu  j013549.5 + 661243 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we used the sas tool xmmselect to produce mos1 , mos2 , and pn energy spectra for xmmu  j013549.5 + 661243 and considered the recommendations given in a recent epic ( mos and pn ) calibration document for event filtering and energy ranges .",
    "for mos , we used event filtering with the expression `` # xmmea_em & & pattern@xmath6=12 '' and included events within an aperture with a @xmath22 radius . a background spectrum was extracted from an annulus centered on the source , and the source and background regions are shown in figure  [ fig : image]a .",

    "the results of using an absorbed power - law are shown in table  [ tab : spec ] and figure  [ fig : spec ] . for absorption , we used the photoelectric absorption cross sections from @xcite and elemental abundances from @xcite , which correspond to the estimated abundances for the interstellar medium .",
    "this model gives a good fit ( @xmath77 ) , and requires a relatively hard power - law photon index of @xmath3 .",
    "the power - law fit gives a 0.212  kev unabsorbed flux of @xmath78 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2 and a column density of @xmath4  @xmath1 , which is somewhat higher than the value through the galaxy along the line of sight , @xmath79 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although this could indicate a small amount of absorption local to the source , it is much lower than the values near @xmath80 @xmath1 seen for the sources usually considered to be obscured hmxbs .",
    "another argument against local absorption of the x - ray source is that the value of @xmath812.0 corresponds to an @xmath82 in the range ( 1.01.4)@xmath83  @xmath1 @xcite , which is consistent with the column density determined from the x - ray spectrum .    , indicating a relatively hard spectrum ( @xmath3 ) but not a highly absorbed spectrum .",

    "the very hard x - ray spectrum that we measure for xmmu  j013549.5 + 661243 is inconsistent with a thermal spectrum with such a low temperature , indicating that the be star must have a compact binary companion that is emitting most of the x - ray emission .    while the x - ray luminosity and spectrum are not consistent with an isolated star , the _ xmm - newton _ data alone are not sufficient to determine the nature of the compact binary companion .",

    "we discuss igr  j01363 + 6610 in this context .      models for x - ray emission from be x - ray binaries are based on the picture of a neutron star with a relatively strong magnetic field ( @xmath117  g ) and a relatively slow rotation speed ( @xmath1181,000  s ) periodically accreting from the circumstellar disk around the be star @xcite . in most systems ,",
    "the orbits have non - zero eccentricity , and `` type 1 '' x - ray outbursts occur when the neutron star makes its closest approach to the star so that the outburst periodicity is equal to the orbital period , @xmath119 .    within this physical picture , there are two accretion regimes that are usually considered .",
    "one regime is at higher mass accretion rates when the accretion pressure overcomes the centrifugal magnetic field barrier , and matter is accreted directly onto the poles of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the second regime is during times when the accretion is inhibited by the magnetic field .",
    "this is often called the propeller regime @xcite , and the x - ray emission is much lower in this regime because the matter being accreted only reaches the neutron star magnetosphere rather than falling onto the neutron star surface .",
    "a gap is predicted between the minimum luminosity in which the system can be in the direct accretion regime and the maximum luminosity in which the system can be in the propeller regime @xcite , and we define @xmath120 to be equal to this luminosity ratio . for typical neutron star properties",

    "s@xmath2 in 2009 .",
    "these luminosities are unabsorbed values measured in or extrapolated into the 0.212  kev band .",
    "the 2004 outburst luminosity is at the lower end of typical values for normal ( `` type i '' ) be x - ray binary outbursts , which are in the @xmath115 to @xmath124 ergs  s@xmath2 range @xcite .",
    "still , it is likely ( but perhaps not certain if the neutron star spin or magnetic field strength have extreme values ) that the source reached a high enough accretion rate to enter the direct accretion regime .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we derive an upper limit on the luminosity produced by magnetospheric emission of @xmath125 .",
    "thus , under the assumptions that the neutron star properties ( mass , radius , and magnetic field strength ) are typical and the system reached the direct accretion regime during the 2004 outburst , the luminosity measured by _ xmm - newton _ in 2009 implies a neutron star spin period less than 17  s for igr  j01363 + 6610 .    while the propeller regime may extend to very low luminosities , a third regime to consider",
    "is when the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star drops to zero . in this case",
    ", any x - ray emission produced could have contributions from the be star and from the neutron star .",
    "emission from the neutron star would be thermal in origin and would be extremely soft .",
    "such components are seen at temperatures near 50150  ev in lmxbs @xcite and although it is unclear whether this regime occurs for be x - ray binaries , it has probably been seen for the hmxb supergiant fast x - ray transient ( sfxt ) igr  j175442619 @xcite . during the _ xmm - newton _ observation of igr  j01363 + 6610 , we are not seeing this regime since we measure a hard spectrum , which is either non - thermal or has a much higher temperature ( @xmath126  kev ) than would be expected from a non - accreting neutron star . since we did not detect the source during the _ chandra _ observation , the spectrum is not constrained .",
    "assuming the same @xmath82 as seen during outburst ( @xmath127 @xmath1 ) , we can put limits on the flux and the temperature of the neutron star by requiring an acis count rate below the upper limit given above .",
    "we use the magnetic neutron star model _ nsa _",
    "@xcite , assuming emission from the entire neutron star , a mass of 1.4 , a radius of 10 km , a distance of 2 kpc , and a magnetic field of @xmath128  g. the upper limit on the ( unredshifted ) surface temperature is then 80  ev , and the unabsorbed 0.212  kev luminosity upper limit is @xmath6@xmath129 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "changes in the assumptions will affect this , particularly changes in the assumed @xmath82 or distance .",
    "for instance , a choice of @xmath130 @xmath1 gives @xmath131  ev and @xmath132 ergs  s@xmath2 , or a distance of 3  kpc gives @xmath133  ev and @xmath134 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "if the x - ray emission in this quiescent state is dominated by hot spots at the polar caps , their temperature may be higher , but the temperature of the rest of the neutron star surface must be even lower .",
    "the above analysis suggests that the igr  j01363 + 6610 luminosities can be explained within the standard picture for be - neutron star x - ray binaries , but the luminosity upper limit that we infer from the _ chandra _ observation is lower than has been previously reported from these systems . @xcite",

    "in addition , quiescent luminosities of ( 39)@xmath136 ergs  s@xmath2 and ( 24.5)@xmath136 ergs  s@xmath2 have been reported for gro  j2058 + 42 and a  0535 + 26 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the candidate be x - ray binary xte  j1829098 has been observed at a luminosity of @xmath138 ( @xmath139  kpc)@xmath140 ergs  s@xmath2 @xcite , which is low for a be x - ray binary , but still not as low as we find for igr  j01363 + 6610 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that , for a  0535 + 26 , @xcite found the source at this luminosity after it had previously been reported to have a quiescent luminosity two orders of magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "thus , it is clear that even when they are not in outburst , these sources exhibit a large amount of variability , and many observations may be required for each source to define a quiescent luminosity .",
    "while the _ chandra _ upper limit of @xmath6@xmath7 ( @xmath141  kpc)@xmath140 ergs  s@xmath2 obtained with a hard spectrum as seen in outburst is significantly lower than has been found for other be x - ray binaries , this conclusion does depend on the validity of the distance determination .",
    "the 2  kpc distance from @xcite depends on the measurement of the @xmath103-band magnitude , which is given in @xcite to high precision ( @xmath142 , based on three measurements ) , the extinction , and the spectral type . @xcite",
    "give a value of @xmath143 , and our determination is consistent with this suggesting that the uncertainty in the distance due to the measurement of extinction is not large .",
    "probably the largest uncertainty is related to the spectral type .",
    "@xcite use a spectral type of b1v and an absolute magnitude of @xmath144 = 3.2 for the 2  kpc estimate , but they indicate that the star could be a more luminous sub - giant ( i.e. , b1iv ) . the difference in the absolute magnitude of a main sequence b - type star compared to a b - type sub - giant is 0.60.7 magnitudes @xcite , so it is unlikely that the star is more luminous than @xmath145 4.0 , which corresponds to a distance upper limit near 3  kpc .",
    "this , in turn , indicates an upper limit on the quiescent x - ray luminosity of @xmath6@xmath146 ergs  s@xmath2 , which is still significantly lower than the x - ray luminosities given above for comparison .",
    "although it is not clear why the quiescent luminosity is so much lower for igr  j01363 + 6610 , there are several potentially interesting possibilities . among the more trivial",
    "is the possibility that the short ( 5  ks ) _ chandra _ observation occurred during an x - ray eclipse .",
    "although eclipses are not common for be x - ray binaries due to their typically wide orbits , we currently can not rule out this possibility since the orbit and binary inclination for igr  j01363 + 6610 are unconstrained .",
    "it is also possible that _ chandra _ did not detect the source either because the compact object was highly obscured during the _ chandra _ observation or that _ chandra _ happened to catch the source during a low point in its normal short - term variability .",
    "finally , there is also the possibility that the circumstellar disk , which was strongly present in 2004 and 2009 based on the detection of the h@xmath17 emission line with an ew of @xmath1250 , had dissipated during the 2007 _ chandra _ observation . although dissipation and re - formation of a circumstellar disk on this time scale did occur in the case of gro  j100857 @xcite , and significant disk loss",
    "was observed for igr  j06074 + 2205 on a time scale of @xmath123 years @xcite , in both of these cases , the h@xmath17 lines were significantly weaker than measured for igr  j01363 + 6610 .",
    "there is no precedent that we are aware of for dissipation and re - formation of a circumstellar disk in a system with an h@xmath17 ew as large as the one measured for igr  j01363 + 6610 .",
    "while there are possible explanations for the luminosity upper limit measured over a short period of time by _ chandra _ , these explanations do not apply to the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the luminosity measured by _ xmm - newton _ would also make it one of , if not the , lowest luminosity be x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , it is likely that the low luminosities measured for igr  j01363 + 6610 require that this system has some unusual physical properties .",
    "the be x - ray binaries with known compact object type have neutron stars , but binary evolution models predict that between zero and two of the 64 known be x - ray binary systems harbor a black hole instead of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the observational signatures for be x - ray binaries with black holes are not as clear as neutron star signatures , such as pulsations . at high mass accretion rates , one would expect the x - ray emission from black holes to be softer and brighter due to the presence of an inner accretion disk that can not form in systems with highly magnetized neutron stars due to the magnetosphere . at moderate to low mass accretion rates , accreting",
    "black holes typically have hard spectra @xcite . at very low mass accretion rates , black hole systems",
    "would likely be fainter than neutron star systems because the latter exhibit magnetospheric and surface emission , which are both absent from black holes .",
    "the expected hard spectrum and the faint quiescent luminosity are both consistent with the observed properties of igr  j01363 + 6610",
    ".    there may , however , be a less exotic explanation if the binary orbit of igr  j01363 + 6610 causes a neutron star to sample an unusually low density part of the circumstellar disk .",
    "this could occur if the system has a long orbital period with relatively low eccentricity . as pointed out by @xcite , the ew of the h@xmath17 line for igr  j01363 +",
    "6610 is one of the strongest of any be x - ray binary , suggesting the presence of a large circumstellar disk , which might favor a large and nearly circular orbit over a highly eccentric orbit . while the system may have a large circumstellar disk , @xcite have shown that tidal interations of the neutron star can lead to truncation of the circumstellar disk in low eccentricity systems .",
    "in addition to providing a possible explanation for the low quiescent luminosity of igr  j01363 + 6610 , the fact that the disk can be truncated to a size smaller than the be star s roche lobe means that the system will not show luminous outbursts @xcite , which is consistent with what has been seen so far for igr  j01363 + 6610 .    like",
    "igr  j01363 + 6610 , the orbital parameters for the other be x - ray binaries with the strongest h@xmath17 emission lines , a  1118616 @xcite and igr  j01583 + 6713 @xcite , are not known .",
    "it has been suggested that a  1118616 has a nearly circular orbit based on its having a small number of outbursts with no clear periodicity @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that both of these systems have relatively long orbital periods ( @xmath120.62.2 years ) based on measured neutron star spin periods of 405.6  s and 469.2  s and the @xmath119@xmath147 relationship for be x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "however , for igr  j01583 + 6713 , the detection of x - ray pulsations was noted as being marginal in @xcite .",
    "although there is no direct indication of the orbital or spin period for igr  j01363 + 6610 , it should be noted that the limit of @xmath148  s mentioned above could be taken as evidence for a smaller @xmath119 ; however , we view the evidence for a limit on the spin period as being relatively weak .",
    "in summary , the detection of the variable hard x - ray source xmmu  j013549.5 + 661243 at the location of a be star provides confirmation that igr  j01363 + 6610 is a be x - ray binary .",
    "although some of its properties suggest that it is a fairly typical hmxb , its 2007 non - detection by _",
    "chandra _ indicate a quiescent x - ray luminosity that is significantly lower than has been measured previously for other be x - ray binaries .",
    "while some possible explanations for the low luminosity ( an eclipse , a large change in the column density or spectrum , an extended drop in mass accretion rate , or dissipation of the be star s circumstellar disk ) may be consistent with relatively normal be x - ray binary properties , other possibilities would require that igr  j01363 + 6610 has unusual properties .",
    "one possibility is that the system has a large and relatively circular orbit , which could explain the low duty cycle for outbursts and , perhaps , the low quiescent luminosity .",
    "another very interesting possibility is that this could be a be - black hole system .",
    "the former suggestion could be confirmed by a measurement of the orbital period ( although this will be challenging since the source does not seem to produce regular outbursts ) , and the latter suggestion could be refuted with the detection of pulsations during another outburst from the source .",
