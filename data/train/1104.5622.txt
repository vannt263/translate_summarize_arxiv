    "recently , we have been interested in a family of soft , long - range pair interactions that give rise to novel physical behaviors of many - particle systems including classical disordered ground states for a range of densities , negative thermal expansion , and vanishing normal - mode frequencies.@xcite this family of soft pair interactions includes those pair potentials @xmath1 with fourier transforms @xmath2 that are positive , bounded , and vanish to zero at some finite wavenumber @xmath3 and beyond .",
    "the potential energy @xmath4 of a system of @xmath5 particles in a fundamental cell with volume @xmath6 under periodic boundary conditions can be written as @xmath7 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the distance between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the fourier coefficients of the density field , and @xmath12 are the wave vectors appropriate for the system size and shape .",
    "these soft pair interactions , called `` collective - coordinate '' potentials , are bounded and possess long - range oscillations in real space.@xcite    because of the finite cutoff in @xmath0-space , an analytic lower bound for the potential energy per particle @xmath13 is easily obtainable , and numerical methods allow for the construction and investigation of ground states with extremely high precision .",
    "a series of studies has examined the structural characteristics of ground states in one,@xcite two,@xcite and three dimensions.@xcite three structural ground - state regimes were found to characterize these two - dimensional systems .",
    "increasing the fraction of degrees of freedom that are constrained @xmath14 , equivalently decreasing density , spans regimes that are disordered , wavy - crystalline , and crystalline .",
    "recently , an analytical connection between the fraction of constrained degrees of freedom within the system and the disorder - order phase transition for a class of target structure factors has been provided@xcite by examining the realizability of the constrained contribution to the pair correlation function .",
    "more recently , these potentials were used to construct `` stealthy '' and `` hyperuniform '' materials in two dimensions.@xcite `` stealthy '' materials refer to point patterns that completely suppress single scattering of radiation for certain wavelength ranges . while nonstealthy materials may allow for some small amount of scattering , stealthy materials are absolutely transparent at those wavelengths .",
    "`` hyperuniform '' refers to point patterns in which infinite wavelength density fluctuations vanish.@xcite ( these terms are defined more precisely in sec .  [ sec : background ] . )",
    "the hyperuniformity notion enables the rank ordering of crystals , quasicrystals and special disorderedmany - particle systems.@xcite interestingly , disordered hyperuniform many - particle ground states , and therefore also point distributions , with substantial clustering can be constructed.@xcite    constructed ground states are now the basis for novel disordered materials with tunable , photonic band gaps.@xcite using a model potential from the family of collective - coordinate potentials in two dimensions , the `` @xmath0-space overlap potential , '' described in sec.[sec : background ] , we observed negative thermal expansion and vanishing normal - mode frequencies for ground - state configurations .",
    "we attributed these phenomena to the nature of the underlying energy landscape , which we described as having ground - state `` valleys '' that weave between the higher - energy portions of the landscape.@xcite    despite the discovery of the existence of such unique properties , the fundamental mechanisms allowing for disordered ground states and stealthy point patterns still need to be fully elucidated .",
    "here , we analyze the energy landscape further by examining the associated inherent structures , or local potential - energy minima , for the aforementioned @xmath0-space overlap potential in two dimensions to better understand these properties .",
    "we have two primary motivations for this work .",
    "first , through the course of our previous research , we have observed several paradoxical phenomena related to local potential - energy minima and glassy behavior .",
    "while an `` inherent structure '' is in general any local potential - energy minimum , the term `` glass '' refers to an amorphous solid that is kinetically trapped in a potential - energy well . in ref .  [ 2 ] , we observed an unusual equation of state when cooling a system compared to a more familiar ( _ e.g. _ , lennard - jones ) glass - forming system as fig .",
    "[ fig : glasses ] demonstrates this schematically . in fig.[fig :",
    "normglass ] , the dark and dotted lines represent the equilibrium equation of state and nonequilibrium isobaric cooling path for a lennard - jones system .",
    "figure [ fig : ccglass ] shows the corresponding cooling paths for a system interacting with the @xmath0-space overlap potential . in the more familiar glass - forming system , there is a well - defined glass transition below the freezing point that is dependent on the rate at which the system is cooled.@xcite it is well known that the glass - forming behavior of a system is a function of the underlying energy landscape.@xcite the depths of the potential - energy wells in the energy landscape dictate the dynamics of structural rearrangements of the system.@xcite for the @xmath0-space overlap potential , we observed that at high pressure the nonequilibrium curve deviated from the equilibrium curve at a temperature above the melting temperature , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccglass ] . at lower pressures where there is no well - defined melting temperature ,",
    "as in the wavy - crystalline regime , the nonequilibrium curve deviates similarly from the equilibrium curve .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-space overlap potential gives rise to negative thermal expansion , generally for nondimensional @xmath15.@xcite    other paradoxical behaviors have led us toward a broad analysis of the energy landscape .",
    "we have observed that some ground - state configurations , particularly crystalline structures , had many zero - energy normal modes .",
    "these ground states are therefore not mechanically rigid .",
    "however , while using numerical minimization algorithms to construct ground - state configurations , we encountered many mechanically stable local potential - energy minima .",
    "lastly , there exists a large density range in which the energy landscape was evidently devoid of all local minima .",
    "an increment in @xmath14 just outside this range introduced local potential - energy minima to the landscape .",
    "while we have previously observed these phenomena,@xcite the fundamental mechanisms that underlie them are not fully understood .",
    "the inherent - structure analysis has proven to be a fruitful method for relating the energy landscape to low - temperature phenomena .",
    "many studies have examined inherent - structure characteristics in glass - forming liquids with strong repulsive cores such as the stillinger - weber potential,@xcite water - like pair potentials,@xcite binary lennard - jones - like systems,@xcite and general repulsive potentials.@xcite the inherent structures for lennard - jones and steeply repulsive potentials are in general not hyperuniform or stealthy due to the dominance of grain boundaries and vacancy defects .",
    "in contrast to the above list of strongly repelling potentials , the @xmath0-space overlap potential is a soft interaction .",
    "soft interactions are often useful models for soft - matter systems such as colloids , polymers , and microemulsions.@xcite in addition , these @xmath0-space overlap interactions are also qualitatively similar to friedel oscillations in molten metals.@xcite the @xmath0-space overlap potential is localized in @xmath0-space and delocalized in real space as a result of the fourier transform .",
    "certain duality relations link the ground - state energies of the @xmath0-space overlap potential to the ground - state energies of real space analog.@xcite there have been several investigations of the inherent structures of various soft interactions . the gaussian - core model in two dimensions has polycrystalline inherent structure with a large correlation length even when sampled from the liquid state.@xcite energy landscape analyses revealed that the range of the morse potential affects the relation between temperature and the potential - energy distribution of sampled inherent structures.@xcite while for the yukawa potential , inherent structures varied depending on whether they were obtained from the liquid , crystal or hexatic phase.@xcite    novel , stealthy dielectric materials are currently being fabricated,@xcite and nearly stealthy ceramic materials are of interest for optical applications.@xcite because of these recent experimental applications and the unusual physical behaviors discovered,@xcite we are also motivated to understand the fundamental differences between point patterns that absolutely suppress scattering for certain wavelengths and those that nearly suppress scattering . our ground - state construction procedure @xcite automatically distinguishes stealthy and hyperuniform configurations from those that do not possess such properties .",
    "in particular , we want to understand whether the particle rearrangements required to transform nearly hyperuniform and stealthy materials to configurations that are perfectly hyperuniform and stealthy are global or local in nature .",
    "while a general method for understanding these particle rearrangements would require a new algorithm to search for collective motions that increase stealthiness , the collective - coordinate approach provides an excellent framework from which to address this question . here",
    ", we provide two methods for identifying rearrangements in particle systems to achieve stealthy and hyperuniform materials . for large @xmath14 , we use the nudged - elastic - band algorithm to connect inherent structures , which are nearly hyperuniform and nearly stealthy , to ground states along a minimum - energy path . for small @xmath14 values , we have identified that there are no inherent structures higher up in the energy landscape . therefore , we study the rearrangements from a saturated random sequential addition ( rsa ) of hard disks@xcite to ground states of the @xmath0-space overlap potential .",
    "we use saturated rsa systems as initial conditions because upon saturation they suppress scattering for small wavenumbers and are nearly hyperuniform.@xcite we also introduce a stealthiness metric and a configurational proximity metric to quantify characteristics of these transitions .    in this paper",
    ", we use a collective - coordinate potential and a simulation methodology to find stealthy point patterns and local potential - energy minima above the ground state .",
    "we probe the following fundamental questions :    * how are inherent structures and their thermodynamic properties in collective coordinate systems different from those found in other soft - potential systems ? * to what extent are inherent structures stealthy and/or hyperuniform ? * how are the features of inherent structures related to the pair potential function ? *",
    "what collective particle rearrangements are necessary to construct a path from an inherent structure to a ground state ? * what global and/or local particle rearrangements are necessary to convert a nearly stealthy and nearly hyperuniform system in to one that is absolutely stealthy and hyperuniform ?",

    "there are certain practical limits on stealthiness .",
    "because of the weights assigned by @xmath2 for @xmath0 near @xmath3 , the metric @xmath59 may not necessarily be suppressed to zero for ground states due to numerical precision of the quantity @xmath63 .",

    ", we subject the system to an additional quenching via the minop algorithm.@xcite we previously reported the efficiency of the minop algorithm compared to the conjugate gradient method.@xcite we add this final quench for reasons of increased efficiency and precision compared to simply using the conjugate gradient method to high precision .",
    "many of the inherent structures that we have found have very slight differences in the scaled potential energy @xmath52 that can be on the order of magnitude @xmath67 .",
    "our implementation of the conjugate gradient method becomes inefficient at these tolerances . while there is a possibility that the minop algorithm can traverse to other capture basins",
    ", we suspect that the system is quenched sufficiently deep into a potential - energy well after the conjugate gradient step that the minop algorithm will not push the system into another capture basin .",
    "we initialize the dynamical trajectories at a temperature associated with the liquid state . here , we report the dimensionless temperature @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath70 is the simulation temperature .",
    "we previously reported that the transitions from ground states to highly disordered liquids occur in the range of @xmath71-@xmath72 , depending on @xmath14.@xcite we initialize our simulations at @xmath73 .",
    "configurations are sampled every @xmath74 time steps until at least fifty are obtained .",
    "then the velocities of the system are rescaled to a lower temperature by @xmath75 , typically a value of 0.00015 , and the configurations are sampled again at the reduced temperature",
    ". the rate at which the system is effectively cooled becomes @xmath76 .",
    "we have explored a range of coolings rates from @xmath77 with @xmath74 varying from 3 to 750 .",
    "surprisingly , as discussed in sec.[sec : cooling ] , while the properties of the thermal structures are sensitive to the cooling rate , the properties of the inherent structures are not .    to construct pathways between ground - state configurations and inherent structures for @xmath78 , we use the `` nudged - elastic - band algorithm '' used for finding minimum - energy transition paths.@xcite this method requires as an input two local minima that are nearby in the energy landscape .",
    "we generate this pair of structures by initializing a known ground - state configuration ( obtained by the search methods in ref .  [ 3 ] ) , assigning a small temperature to the system , and integrating the equations of motion .",
    "the configurations are quenched by the conjugate gradient / minop minimization every five time steps .",
    "a simulation run is terminated when the quenching of a configuration produces a local minimum in a new capture basin .",
    "this new inherent structure is presumed to be near the original ground state in configuration space .",
    "we then apply the nudged - elastic - band ( neb ) algorithm@xcite to the ground state / inherent structure pair .",
    "the algorithm discretizes the path between two local minima in a potential - energy landscape into `` beads , '' or image configurations .",
    "these beads , representing configurations , are connected via harmonic springs of zero natural length .",
    "then a minimization algorithm is applied to minimize simultaneously the force parallel to the string of beads and the force perpendicular to the true force .",
    "the algorithm bends the string of beads around the `` hills '' in the energy landscape .",
    "the end result is a discrete path that provides the minimum - energy path from one potential - energy minimum , through a low - order saddle point , and to the other potential - energy minimum .",
    "while a large number of `` beads '' allows for a more refined minimum - energy pathway , we find that using fifty beads serves our purposes well by yielding a smooth transition pathway and a reasonable approximation to the saddle point .",
    "occasionally , there are other inherent structures in the vicinity of the straight - line interpolation between the inherent structure and ground state used as an initial condition . in these cases ,",
    "the neb algorithm will not produce a smooth transition from the ground state to the original inherent structure , and therefore we refine our initial ground state / inherent structure pair .",
    "for example , when using the triangular lattice as an initial condition for say @xmath79 , there are number of zero - energy modes that the system can traverse during the molecular dynamics trajectories . when applying the neb algorithm to a triangular lattice / inherent structure pair , the pathway has a preference to bend toward the zero - energy path before moving uphill toward the saddle point .",
    "this caused the energy of the transition - state pathway to appear rugged since the string of beads was pushed near a different inherent structure .",
    "in these cases , we searched the string of beads for a new ground - state / inherent structure pair .",
    "we minimized the potential energy of each bead until we found a new ground state / inherent structure pair closer together than the original pair and applied the neb algorithm again .",
    "this method does not guarantee that we find the closest inherent structure to a ground state nor does it guarantee that the saddle point is a first - order ( single negative eigenvalue ) saddle .    for @xmath42",
    ", we examine particle rearrangements from rsa configurations to ground states . to generate rsa packings , disks of diameter @xmath80",
    "are randomly , sequentially , and irreversibly placed inside a simulation cell so that they do not overlap with any other particles .",
    "the process is saturated when additional particles can not be placed without overlapping other particles . in practice , this occurs after a very large number of attempted particle insertions are rejected . here",
    ", we terminate the process after 1.5 million attempted particle placements .",
    "since @xmath3 is fixed to be unity , we must select a target number density @xmath81 that corresponds to our target @xmath14 . using a desired number of particles in a saturated system of 750 particles",
    ", we then identify the appropriate system area .",
    "the simulation cell is chosen to be a square box .",
    "we can then assign the particles a diameter @xmath80 so that upon saturation of the rsa process , we achieve close to the desired number density . for rsa processes in two dimensions , the saturation packing fraction @xmath82 is 0.547.@xcite the assigned diameter becomes @xmath83 . in our rsa patters ,",
    "the number of particles did not match the target number of particles due to finite system effects .",
    "given the dimensions of the box and the number of particles , we can then assign the appropriate wave vectors and @xmath14 value to the system .",
    "the potential energy of the system is then quenched using the conjugate gradient method followed by a quenching using the minop algorithm as was detailed above .    to characterize inherent structures , we use several quantitative metrics .",
    "the structure factor @xmath27 , _ cf . _ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) , provides structural information on the long - ranged ordering of the system .",
    "defined above , @xmath52 is a scaled potential energy and @xmath59 is a metric for the extent of stealthiness .",
    "in addition , we use the small-@xmath0 features of @xmath27 to compare the extent of hyperuniformity between structures .",
    "hyperuniform systems have the feature that @xmath27 vanishes as @xmath0 approaches zero .",
    "we fit the small-@xmath0 regime ( _ i.e. _ @xmath84 ) to a log - polynomial equation @xmath85 the parameter @xmath86 can be considered to be a metric for the extent of hyperuniformity , where a value that diverges to @xmath87 indicates that a system is hyperuniform .",
    "this metric is best used for relative comparisons among systems since numerical precision is limited .",
    "for example , one could say system a is more hyperuniform than system b because it has a lower value of @xmath86 .",
    "however , @xmath86 is not be a sufficient test to determine if a configuration is absolutely hyperuniform ( _ i.e. , _",
    "one should refrain from saying system a is absolutely hyperuniform ) .",
    "we also employ the bond - order parameter @xmath88 defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the angle between two particles with respect to a fixed , but arbitrary , coordinate axis , to quantify the local orientation order .",
    "particles are considered `` bonded '' if @xmath91 , chosen so as to include nearest - neighbors .",
    "for the perfect triangular lattice , @xmath88 has a value of unity while for the ideal gas @xmath88 vanishes .",
    "wavy crystals have value of @xmath88 that can range from about 0.4 to 0.8 .",
    "we introduce a configurational proximity parameter @xmath92 defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the positions of the rsa configuration and ground state configuration respectively and @xmath96 is the mean - nearest - neighbor in the rsa configuration .",
    "this metric @xmath92 quantifies the closeness of two different particle configurations . in what follows",
    ", we will apply it to characterize the relative particle displacements required for a configuration to relax to the ground - state energy .",
    "before discussing the results of the quenching and cooling simulations , we briefly discuss some aspects of system - size effects related to the inherent structures of this system . while we previously showed that system - size effects were negligible when characterizing the ground states@xcite and the equilibrium properties,@xcite we find that there are appreciable system - size effects when considering the inherent structures and energy landscape .",
    "we have compared inherent structures consisting 418 particles to 2340 particles sampled from the same temperature . in general , larger systems provide a slightly deeper quenching of the potential energy .",
    "in addition , the bond - order parameters for larger systems tend to be less than that of smaller systems .",
    "this is expected since larger systems often have various polycrystalline - like domains that impart destructive interference on @xmath88 .",
    "the fraction of quenchings from a fixed temperature that achieve the ground state varied considerably across system sizes . while the quenching of the energy of small systems occasionally resulted in achieving a ground - state structure , quenches of the large systems never resulted in a ground - state structure .",
    "the measure of the ground - state manifold becomes increasingly small as the system size increases .",
    "given that the number of inherent structures increases exponentially with respect to system size,@xcite it is unsurprising that larger systems would not sample the capture basins for ground states as frequently as smaller systems .",
    "system - size effects have been also been identified in the binary lennard - jones system.@xcite due to the system - size effects , we should not extrapolate true dynamical information from our results . here , we present the analysis for 418-particle systems , noting that the trends across @xmath14 values are similar to those in the 2340-particle system .",
    "the properties of the excited - state ( or thermalized ) structures behave as expected .",
    "the thermodynamic properties lagged the equilibrium values as the system was cooled , and for slower cooling rates , the lag in thermodynamic properties was smaller than that for fast cooling rates .",

    "five - particle rings , which are related to the local interactions between particles , disrupt the ability of a system to become a stealthy ground state , while grain boundaries , which arise for @xmath14 values in the wavy - crystalline regime , are attributed to the longer - range interactions in a system . while the hyperuniformity parameter @xmath86 and the stealthiness parameter @xmath59 are positively correlated with each other , the bond - order parameter @xmath88 can display a broad range of characteristics for various @xmath14 values .",
    "we have used the nudged - elastic - band algorithm to show that local particle rearrangements can allow systems to be perturbed over a relatively small energy barrier from an inherent structure to a ground state .",
    "these rearrangements correspond to a low configurational proximity metric @xmath92 .",
    "lastly , we have shown that highly local collective particle displacements , as quantified via the configurational proximity metric @xmath92 , are sufficient to convert a rsa configuration into a stealthy , hyperuniform ground state .",
    "while these studies represent another contribution to understanding the nature of these unusual long - ranged potentials , there are some natural extensions to this work that can further illuminate the relationship between particle interactions , stealthiness , and hyperuniformity",
    ". we have used simple metrics @xmath86 and @xmath59 as measures of stealthiness and hyperuniformity , there are a multitude of other metrics that can be constructed .",
    "measuring hyperuniformity for a single finite system is challenging due to the fluctuations and noise that can arise in the small-@xmath0 behavior of @xmath27 . ideally , one would prefer to have a large system where the number variance in an observation window can be measured accurately .",
    "however , we are limited in system size because of numerical methods .",
    "while our measurement of stealthiness is directly related to the structure factor , we assumed equal weights for all the @xmath27 , while one could assign weights differently to favor small-@xmath0 scattering or near-@xmath3 scattering .",
    "currently , there are no obvious metrics that stand out as superior to those used here .",
    "however , the development of new , improved metrics remains a potential direction of future research .",
    "while our paths connect ground states to inherent structures , a more generic algorithm taking inherent structures to ground states would be valuable .",
    "for instance , our methods relied on knowledge of the ground state and inherent structure _ a priori_. however , a more useful method would be to find the nearest ground - state structure given only an inherent structure",
    ". this algorithm would be far more powerful than the current method .",
    "one could further quantify the possible rearrangements in the inherent structures in order to help produce such an algorithm that relies on trial displacements that search for small energy barriers nearby .",
    "this could lead to a statistical analysis of the types of rearrangements made in a system to determine which are more likely to lead to a ground state .",
    "in addition , a more in - depth study of the rearrangements from rsa configurations to hyperuniform and stealthy configurations would be meaningful .",
    "perhaps one can distinguish the relative contributions of the features of the interaction potential that contribute to the hyperuniformity and stealthiness of a system .",
    "the precise role of the pair interactions in the formation of disordered ground states and stealthiness is unknown . here",
    ", we have determined that five - particle rings are a consequence of the first two minima in the overlap potential @xmath1 .",
    "the ground - state behavior holds for a class of potentials@xcite and we strongly suspect that similar behavior in the inherent structure analysis may generally hold as well . a systematic study involving the determination of ground states for the truncated overlap potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlapvr ] ) might help understand how many local minima in @xmath1 are necessary for disordered ground states to arise .",
    "the potential could be truncated at the first , second , third , _",
    "etc_.  minimum and numerical procedures could be used to find ground - state structures .",
    "this would encounter issues of rigor in that the structures found by numerical methods may not touch the lower bound on @xmath13 .",
    "the trivial lower bound for @xmath13 is zero ( due to the nonnegativity of the overlap potential ) , but for the densities associated with the disordered and wavy - crystalline regimes , the improved lower bound , that being @xmath27 must vanish for all @xmath132 , is not applicable to the truncated @xmath0-space overlap potential .",
    "in addition , we observed that the shape of @xmath2 , which assigns weights to @xmath27 in the potential - energy function , apparently influences the shape of the function @xmath27 for the inherent structures for @xmath106 . above this @xmath14 value",
    ", there was no obvious connection between @xmath2 and @xmath27 for the inherent structures .",
    "this raises the question as to whether the shape of @xmath2 actually influences the shape of the function @xmath27 for inherent structures .",
    "a simple study varying the shape of @xmath2 , but maintaining the compact support at @xmath3 and the positivity of @xmath2 would help answer this question .",
    "lastly , while this collective coordinate setup was used understand and design new materials in two - dimensions , such as photonic bandgap materials,@xcite the extension to three dimensions should be particularly fruitful . while we have some understanding of stealthy ground states in three dimensions,@xcite the relations between inherent structures and ground states may be different in three dimensions than two dimensions . connecting these structural rearrangements and physical properties can help to contribute to the next class of three - dimensional photonic bandgap materials .",
