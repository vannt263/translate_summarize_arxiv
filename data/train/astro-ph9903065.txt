    "the ursa minor ( umi ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy was independently discovered by wilson ( @xcite ) and hubble .",
    "ursa minor is the second closest satellite galaxy of the milky way at a distance of @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath0220,000 light years ) from the sun .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams of the brightest stars of this faint ( @xmath16 mag : kleyna @xcite ) small ( @xmath17 pc : irwin & hatzidimitriou @xcite ) galaxy feature a strong blue horizontal branch ( e.g. , van agt @xcite ; cudworth , olszewski , & schommer @xcite ; kleyna , @xcite )  a unique horizontal branch morphology amongst the nine galactic dsph satellite galaxies .",
    "the deep @xmath18 ccd observations of olszewski & aaronson ( @xcite ) indicate that ursa minor has an age and abundance very similar to that of the ancient metal - poor galactic globular cluster m92 ( ngc 6341 ) .",
    "ursa minor may be the only dwarf galaxy in the local group which is composed exclusively of stars older than 10 gyr ( mateo @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we investigate the star formation history of the ursa minor spheroidal galaxy using archival _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 data .",
    "section 2 is a discussion of the observations and photometric reductions .",
    "we present and compare our results with previous work in sec .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "appendix a describes a new robust algorithm for the computation of of fiducial sequences from high - quality stellar photometry .",
    "the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy was observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on 1995 july 4 through the f555w ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) and f814w ( @xmath0@xmath19 ) filters . the wfpc2 wfall aperture ( biretta @xcite )",
    "was centered on the target position given in table  [ tbl - obslog ] and shown in figure [ fig - fov ] .",
    "two low - gain observations were obtained in each filter .",
    "these observations were secured as part of the _ hst _ cycle 5 program gto / wfc 6282 ( pi : westphal ) and were placed in the public data archive at the space telescope science institute on 1996 july 5 .",
    "the datasets were recalibrated at the canadian astronomy data centre and retrieved electronically by us using a guest account which was kindly established for kjm .",
    "these wfpc2 observations contain several types of image defects .",
    "figure [ fig - u2pb0103 t ] shows a negative mosaic image of the u2pb0103 t dataset . besides exhibiting normal cosmic ray damage , this 1100-s f555w exposure also shows ( 1 ) a satellite trail on the wf4 ccd , ( 2 ) an elevated background near the inner corner of the pc1 ccd , and ( 3 ) shadows are seen on all four ccds .",
    "the elevated background near the inner - corner of the pc1 ccd is probably due to stray light patterns from a bright star just outside of the pc1 field - of - view ( cf .",
    "7.1.a of biretta , ritchie , & rudloff @xcite ) .",
    "the shadows seen on all four ccds are indicative of a serious problem with these observations because the shadows are generally seen against an elevated background throughout the entire wfpc2 field - of - view .",
    "this phenomenon is due to light from the bright sun - lit earth reflecting off the optical telescope assembly ( ota ) baffles and the secondary mirror supports ( `` spider '' ) and into the wfpc2 instrument .",
    "elevated backgrounds occur when the angle between the earth and the ota axis is @xmath2025 degrees ( cf .",
    "11.2.a of biretta @xcite ) .",
    "the background `` sky '' brightened significantly during the course of these observations ( see figure [ fig - intensity_histograms ] ) indicating that the _ hubble space telescope _ experienced earthrise during these wfpc2 observations of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "the experimental design of these wfpc2 observations was nearly identical to that of the carina dwarf spheroidal program gto / wfc 5637 ( pi : westphal ) which was analyzed by mighell ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore planned to follow mighell s carina photometric reduction procedures in this investigation of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal .",
    "unfortunately , the standard cosmic - ray removal procedure failed spectacularly due to earthrise causing the background sky level to change rapidly . we had to improvise more complicated analysis techniques than ones used by mighell in his carina study in order to obtain stellar photometry of comparable quality .",
    "we found stellar candidates on cosmic - ray cleaned images which were suitable for the detection of point sources but unsuitable for further photometric analysis .",
    "the cosmic rays were removed by using the crrej task of the iraf stsdas.hst_calib.wfpc package with the sky subtraction parameter set to sky = mode instead of the default value of sky = none  this unusual option was required because the sky levels of the observations did not scale with exposure time .",
    "we used crrej to make a clean f555w observation of 2100 s from the u2pb0102 t and u2pb0103 t datasets and a clean f814w observation of 2300 s from the u2pb0105 t and u2pb0106 t datasets .",
    "figure  [ fig - crrej ] shows that this procedure repaired most of the cosmic - ray damage seen in figure  [ fig - u2pb0103 t ] .",
    "this procedure is clearly not perfect since traces of the satellite trial are still visible .",
    "the sky = mode option produces cosmic - ray cleaned images with modal pixel values near zero .",
    "many background pixels will thus have negative values which implies negative background - flux values .",
    "such physically unrealistic background data values are quite rightly rejected by many standard ccd stellar photometry packages .",
    "unsharp mask images of the clean f555w and f814w observations were made using the ( low - pass difference ) digital filter which was designed by mighell to optimize the detection of faint stars in _ hst _ wf / pc and wfpc2 images ( appendix a of mighell & rich @xcite , and references therein ) . the f555w unsharp mask image ( see figure  [ fig - crrej_lpd ] ) and the f814w unsharp mask image were then added together to create a master unsharp mask image of each wf ccd .",
    "a simple peak detector algorithm was then used on the master unsharp images to create a list of point source candidates with coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 on each wf ccd .",
    "this allowed the use of almost the entire field - of - view of each wf camera while avoiding edge - effects in the outer regions .",
    "we only present the analysis of data obtained from the wf cameras in this paper .",
    "the data were analyzed with the ccdcap digital circular aperture photometry code developed by mighell to analyze _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 observations ( mighell @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a fixed aperture with a radius of 2.5 pixels was used for all stars on the wf ccds .",
    "the local background level was determined from a robust estimate of the mean intensity value of all pixels between 2.5 and 6.0 pixels from the center of the circular stellar aperture .",
    "point source candidates were rejected if either ( 1 ) the measured signal - to - noise ratio of either instrumental magnitude was snr@xmath2010 ; or ( 2 ) the center of the aperture [ which was allowed to move in order to maximize the snr ] changed by more than 1.8 pixels from its detected position on the master unsharp mask .",
    "the charge transfer effect was removed from the instrumental magnitudes by using a 4% uniform wedge along the y - axis of each ccd as described in holtzman ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the standard wfpc2 magnitude system ( holtzman @xcite ) which is defined using 1  diameter apertures .",
    "we measured the stars with a smaller aperture ( 0.5  diameter ) in order to optimize the measured stellar signal - to - noise ratios ; usage of 1  diameter apertures resulted in significantly poorer photometry for the faint stars .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , were transformed to johnson @xmath1 and cousins @xmath19 magnitudes using the following equations @xmath25(\\vmi ) + [ 0.027 \\!\\pm\\!0.002](\\vmi)^2 + [ 21.725\\!\\pm\\!0.005 ] $ ] and @xmath26(\\vmi ) + [ 0.025\\!\\pm\\!0.002](\\vmi)^2 + [ 20.839\\!\\pm\\!0.006 ] $ ] where an instrumental magnitude of zero is defined as one dn s@xmath27 at the high gain state ( @xmath014 e@xmath28 dn@xmath27 ) .",
    "the constants come from table 7 of holtzman ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values for average aperture corrections , required to convert instrumental magnitudes measured with an aperture of radius 2.5 pixels to a standard aperture of radius 5.0 pixels ( 1  diameter ) .",
    "a catalog of 289 synthetic point spread functions of a g - type star was created with a @xmath29 square grid for each filter ( f555w and f814w ) and ccd ( wf2 , wf3 , and wf4 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of one synthetic psf every 50 pixels in @xmath30 and @xmath31 allowed for the determination of aperture corrections for any star in the entire wfpc2 field - of - view to have a spatial resolution of @xmath3235 pixels . ] , @xmath33 , for each filter / ccd combination are listed in table [ tbl - delta ] .",
    "the zero - order ( `` breathing '' ) aperture corrections , for the small aperture which , by definition , can be positive or negative .",
    "zero - order aperture corrections are generally small for long exposures , however , they can be quite large for short exposures that were obtained while the wfpc2 was slightly out of focus ( by a few microns ) due to the expansion / contraction of the _ hst _ during its normal breathing cycle . ] for these observations ( @xmath34 : see table [ tbl - sdelta ] ) were computed using a large aperture with a radius of 3.5 pixels and a background annulus of @xmath35 pixels .",
    "two ( @xmath36 ) datasets pairs , ( u2pb0102 t , u2pb0105 t ) and ( u2pb0103 t , u2pb0106 t ) , were reduced independently using ccdcap and the resulting instrumental magnitudes were transformed to johnson @xmath1 and cousins @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "we determined which objects probably had acceptable photometry from these independent measurements .",
    "the @xmath1 measurements of a star , @xmath37 [ @xmath38 ( u2pb0102 t , u2pb0105 t ) ] and @xmath39 [ @xmath38 ( u2pb0103 t , u2pb0106 t ) ] , with photometric errors , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , were determined to be acceptable if the following condition was true : @xmath42 , 0.06 \\right ) $ ] . if the condition was satisfied , we then adopted the quantity , @xmath43 $ ] , as the @xmath1 magnitude of the star and adopted the quantity , @xmath44 , as a conservative estimate of its @xmath1 photometric error , @xmath45 .",
    "we assumed that cosmic rays would be the primary cause of poor photometry and therefore adopted the photometry of the faintest measurement of the star whenever the acceptability condition failed .",
    "the adopted @xmath19 magnitude and @xmath19 photometric error , @xmath46 , was determined from both @xmath19 measurements , @xmath47 [ @xmath38 ( u2pb0102 t , u2pb0105 t ) ] and @xmath48 [ @xmath38 ( u2pb0103 t , u2pb0106 t ) ] , in an analogous manner . figure [ fig - delta_mag ] shows the outlier measurements we have identified in this manner .",
    "figure [ fig - cmd_preliminary ] gives our preliminary @xmath1 versus @xmath49 color - magnitude diagram cmd of the observed stellar field in ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "we present our wfpc2 stellar photometry of 696 stars in the central region of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy in table  [ tbl - umi_vi_photometry ] .",
    "the first column gives the identification ( i d ) of the star .",

    "likewise , the fourth and fifth columns give the @xmath51 color and its rms ( @xmath50 ) photometric error @xmath52 .",
    "the sixth column gives the quality flag value of the star .",

    "the @xmath1 versus @xmath51 color - magnitude diagram of the observed stellar field in ursa minor is shown in figure [ fig - cmd ] .",
    "this cmd features a sparsely populated blue horizontal branch , a steep thin red giant branch , and a narrow subgiant branch .",
    "the main sequence reaches @xmath02 magnitudes below the turnoff of the main stellar population of the ursa minor galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig - cmd ] shows a small amount of foreground contamination by foreground stars in our galaxy .",
    "ratnatunga & bahcall ( @xcite ) used the bahcall and soneira galaxy model ( bahcall & soneira @xcite , @xcite ; bahcall @xcite ) to predict that 2.3 foreground stars brighter than @xmath54 mag would be found in one square arcmin in the direction of ursa minor .",
    "our observation surveys 4.44 arcmin@xmath55 of ursa minor and we would therefore expect , from the prediction of ratnatunga and bahcall , to find @xmath010 foreground stars brighter than @xmath54 mag in our color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "a direct check with observations is provided by figure 2 of kleyna ( @xcite ) which indicates that while foreground contamination towards ursa minor is small it can not be ignored .",

    "we get an excellent fit of the ursa minor fiducial sequences to the m92 fiducial sequences when we make the m92 fiducial sequence fainter by @xmath66 mag and add a small color offset of @xmath67 mag .",
    "we show below that the fit is so good that these fiducials are statistically equivalent over a 3 magnitude range ( @xmath68 mag ) from the base of the red giant branch of ursa minor to @xmath01.7 magnitudes below its main - sequence turnoff .",

    "the harris ( @xcite ) analysis of the galactic globular clusters ngc 2419 and m92 found that while the full impact of _ hipparcos _ data and improving stellar models has yet to be felt , an age range of 1215 gyr for the most metal - poor galactic globular clusters is well supported by the current mix of theory and observations .",
    "last year , pont ( @xcite ) estimated that m92 is 14 gyr based on their analysis of the luminosities of cluster turnoff and subgiant branch stars .",
    "they noted that their age estimate for m92 should probably be reduced by @xmath01 gyr if diffusion is important in the cores of globular cluster stars . our above analysis used the pont ( @xcite ) distance to m92 ,",
    "and so we now adopt their age estimate for m92 . using the m92 analogy one last time , we conclude that the age of the main stellar population of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is @xmath014 gyr old .",
    "the findings of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * our comparison of the fiducial sequence of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the galactic globular cluster m92 ( ngc 341 ) indicates that that the median stellar population of the umi dsph galaxy is metal poor ( @xmath4}_{\\rm umi } \\approx { \\rm[fe / h]}_{\\rm m92 } \\approx{\\rm-2.2}$ ] dex ) and ancient ( @xmath5 gyr ) . * the @xmath1 magnitude offset and @xmath51 color offset between ursa minor and m92 are estimated to be @xmath10 mag and @xmath11 mag .",
    "* the ursa minor @xmath6 reddening and the absorption in @xmath1 are estimated to be e@xmath131 mag and @xmath8 mag assuming that the @xmath6 reddening for m92 is @xmath132 mag .",
    "* we have determined that the distance modulus of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is @xmath133 mag based on the the adoption of the apparent @xmath1 distance modulus for m92 of @xmath12 mag ( pont @xcite ) .",
    "the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is then at a distance of @xmath13 kpc from the sun .",
    "these _ hst _ observations indicate that ursa minor has had a very simple star formation history consisting mainly of a single major burst of star formation about 14 gyr ago which probably lasted @xmath142 gyr . while we may have missed minor younger stellar populations due to the small field - of - view of the wfpc2 instrument",
    ", these observations clearly show that most of the stars in the central region ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy are ancient . if the ancient galactic globular clusters , like m92 , formed concurrently with the early formation of milky way galaxy itself , then the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal is probably as old as the milky way .",

    "johnson & bolte ( @xcite , hereafter jb98 ) recently published a @xmath1 versus @xmath49 fiducial sequence for the ancient galactic globular cluster m92 which is shown in figure [ fig - a01]on top of their stellar photometry which was kindly provided to use by jennifer johnson .",
    "jb98 found that mean and mode fitting proved to be susceptible to outliers due to not having enough stars to form a strong ridge line in some areas of the color - magnitude diagram ; their m92 fiducial sequence was determined from the best measured stars and was subsequently drawn by hand and eye .",
    "we now demonstrate that , given enough stars , it is possible to obtain similar results with a new robust fiducial - sequence algorithm which we present herein .    the median value of a normal ( a.k.a .",
    "gaussian ) distribution is the mean value of the distribution . the mean value , ( @xmath134 ) , of a _ small _ nearly - normally - distributed sample is sensitive to the presence of outlier data values ; the median value is less sensitive to outliers and is therefore considered to be a more robust statistic than the mean .",
    "likewise , the average deviation ( a.k.a .",

    "a robust estimate of the mean of a nearly - normally - distributed sample can be determined by deriving the median of a subsample of the parent sample that is within 3.0 average deviations of the median of the parent sample .",
    "this process can , of course , be repeated until the difference between the parent median and the subsample median is negligibly small .",
    "five iterations will generally suffice for the determination of fiducial sequences from high - quality stellar photometry .",
    "we now apply this algorithm ( with 5 iterations ) to the m92 @xmath2 color photometry as a function of @xmath1 magnitude in order to determine its fiducial sequence : @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "the algorithm results with 0.2-mag slices in @xmath1 are given in tabular form in table a1 and graphically in figures [ fig - a02 ] , [ fig - a03 ] and [ fig - a04 ] .",
    "we see that our m92 fiducial sequence ( table a1 ) matches the fit - by - eye fiducial sequence of jb98 near the main - sequence turnoff region ( @xmath141 ) to a remarkable degree with a mean and rms difference of just 0.0004@xmath1100.0047 mag .",
    "the scatter increases slightly for stars brighter than @xmath142 which is not at all surprising given the small sample sizes present on the subgiant branch and red - giant branch of m92 [ see column 6 of table a1 ] . at the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath143 mag ) on the main - sequence ,",
    "figures [ fig - a03 ] and [ fig - a04 ] indicate that our fiducial sequence m92 is slightly redder than that of jb98 . noting that the numbers of the stars in the sample gradually decreases below @xmath144 even though the m92 stellar luminosity function is known to be increasing over this magnitude range ( see , e.g. , stetson & harris @xcite )",
    ", we see that completeness effects become increasingly significant for the jb98 data below @xmath144 mag .",
    "the well - known tendency for faint stars to be measured too bright explains why the algorithm gave redder @xmath96 colors than the fit - by - eye values of johnson & bolte who consciously compensated for this effect in their determination of the m92 fiducial sequence ( see discussion in  3 .  of jb98 ) .",
