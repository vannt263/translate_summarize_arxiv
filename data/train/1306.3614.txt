    "for example , the most recent update of the saga database for chemical abundances of metal - poor stars ( @xcite includes less than 30 objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ; a number of others have recently been added by @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "this star is a subgiant with [ fe / h]@xmath13 , exhibits clear over - abundances of carbon and oxygen , and a lack of enrichment among the neutron - capture elements , placing it within the sub - class of cemp - no stars ( see beers & christlieb 2005 ) .",
    "thanks to its relative brightness , the abundances of other important elements that can constrain the possible progenitors of this star can be determined .",
    "for example , here we report a strong upper limit for be , which is measurable only in the near - uv spectral region .",
    "the be abundance for this star , as well as the abundance of li , are useful for constraining mixing processes that might have occured in this star , and/or the formation process of these light elements in the early universe .",

    "three different grating settings were used in order to cover 30809370  .",
    "we employed an 0.4 arcsec slit width ( and no on - chip binning ) , achieving a resolving power of @xmath21 .",

    "a spectral atlas is provided as online material ( see appendix ) .",
    "the august data are used only for a radial - velocity measurement .",
    "we carried out data reduction with the iraf echelle package , performing overscan subtraction , ccd linearity correction @xcite , cosmic - ray removal ( see  2.2 in @xcite ) , division by the normalized flat - field exposures , extraction of the echelle orders , wavelength calibration , continuum normalization , and combining of all overlapping orders .",
    "the data in pixels affected by bad columns were removed .    the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per 0.9  km  s@xmath23 pixel is estimated as the square root of the photon counts . for the october spectrum , a maximum s / n of 550/1 is achieved at 4700 , where the two grating settings overlap .",
    "the s / n decreases at shorter wavelengths to 300/1 at 3700 , and to 100/1 at 3100 . at 4800 - 7000 , a s / n of 200300",

    "we are in the process of compiling a large master line list of data from used by various studies ( aoki et al .",

    "the equivalent widths of unblended lines , measured by a gaussian fitting procedure , are employed to determine chemical abundances as described in  4 .",
    "the atomic data and measured equivalent widths are listed in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the error of the equivalent width measurement is estimated as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pixel width (  ) , @xmath35 is the number of pixels across the line , and s / n is the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel @xcite . applying this formula , the errors of our measurements are estimated to be smaller than @xmath36m for most of the measured lines , and at most @xmath37m for some individual cases .    for several undetected lines , we list upper limits on the equivalent widths in table  [ tab : lines ] , estimated with a spectrum synthesis approach . we also employ the spectrum synthesis technique for blended lines and molecular features .",

    "heliocentric radial velocities were measured for the high - resolution spectra obtained at four different epochs : 2008 august 22 , 2008 october 4 , 2008 october 5 , and 2008 november 16 . the spectrum obtained with the reddest setting in october 4 is not used , because the number of detected lines that can be employed for the measurement is too small in that wavelength range .",
    "we use 16 isolated lines in the wavelength regions 40304350 and 44204780 , which are covered by all of the spectra for the four epochs , in order to measure the radial velocities . the observed velocities are corrected for the motion of the earth , then converted to heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "the resultant radial velocities and hjd ( heliocentric julian date ) are listed in table  [ tab : velocity ] .",
    "random errors in the radial velocity measurements are estimated as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the sample standard deviation and @xmath40 is the number of lines used ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the derived random error is typically @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the total error is dominated by the systematic error due to the instability of the instrument , which is estimated to be about @xmath43 .",
    "we find no clear variation of the heliocentric radial velocity for bd+44@xmath0493 from 2008 august 22 to 2008 november 16 . furthermore ,",
    "our measurements agree ( within the reported errors ) with the results of the extended radial velocity monitoring of bd+44@xmath0493 from 1984 to 1997 reported by @xcite ; the results of both @xcite and our measurements are shown in figure  [ rv ] .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of radial velocity variations for their sample , including bd+44@xmath0493 .",
    "the ( @xmath44 ) of bd+44@xmath0493 is close to unity , indicating that the scatter of the radial velocity ( the `` rms external error '' @xmath45 ) is mostly explained by mean internal error of measurements ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the @xmath47 value ( 0.23 ) for bd+44@xmath0493 , which is significantly larger than the values of known binary stars , also indicates that the radial velocity scatter is explained by internal errors .",
    "hence , though no useful data exist between their measurements and ours , no signature of radial velocity variation is found for bd+44@xmath0493 over 24 years ( rms = 0.73 km  s@xmath23 ) , indicating that it is either not a binary star , or it is one with an extremely long period .      as shown in figure  [ interstellarna ] , we detect a clear single component of interstellar absorption associated with both the individual d1 and d2 lines .",
    "the observed wavelengths , heliocentric radial velocities , and equivalent widths , which were measured by fitting gaussian profiles , are presented in table  [ interstellard ] .",
    "we confirm that the equivalent widths measured by direct integration differ by less than 5% from those obtained by gaussian fitting .",
    "according to the relationship between the equivalent widths of the interstellar d2 line and distance shown in figure 7 of @xcite , a lower limit on the distance to bd+44@xmath0493 is estimated to be about 200pc .",
    "this result is consistent with the distance derived from the stars geometric parallax ( 205pc ; see  2.5 ) .",
    "the color excess for bd+44@xmath0493 is estimated to be @xmath48 , based on empirical relations between the equivalent width of the interstellar d2 line and @xmath49 provided in table 2 of @xcite .",

    "the orbital parameters of this star ( table  [ tab : kinematics ] ) are calculated for the above data and the radial velocity of bd+44@xmath0493 , following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "the galactocentic rotational velocity , @xmath52 , of bd+44@xmath0493 , its derived @xmath53 ( the maximum distance from the galactic plane reached during its orbit ) , and its orbital eccentricity , @xmath54 , are typical for values associated with objects belonging to the inner - halo population , even though most stars with such extremely low metallicity are usually members of the outer - halo population @xcite .",
    "the kinematic separation into these populations is , however , meaningful only in a statistical sense , and is not definitive for individual objects .",
    "indeed , the outer - halo population has a large dispersion in its orbital parameters , and this star may just be in the tail of the distribution .",
    "we present available photometry for bd+44@xmath0493 in table  [ photometry ] .",
    "values for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 photometry are taken from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite .",

    "the near - ir @xmath59 magnitudes are from the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite , while the value of the @xmath60 color and balmer discontinuity index @xmath61 are from the uvby@xmath62 catalog @xcite .",
    "note that the errors on @xmath63 listed in table  [ photometry ] are random errors , and do not include systematic errors .",
    "the reddening maps of @xcite and @xcite yield @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , along the line of sight toward .",
    "however , taking the short distance to bd+44@xmath0493 into account , these estimates represent upper limits to the true reddening .",
    "following @xcite , we reduced these estimates by the fraction @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the star s distance , @xmath68 is the galactic latitude , and @xmath69 is a constant defined by @xcite as 0.008pc@xmath23 . assigning @xmath70pc ,",

    "however , consensus on the nucleosynthetic origin of this class of stars has yet to be reached .",
    "bd+44@xmath0493 is a particularly important star for addressing this question , as it is by far the brightest cemp - no star at extremely low metallicity . in this section",
    ", we examine the scenarios that have been proposed to account for the origin of cemp - no stars , by comparing the obtained abundance pattern of bd+44@xmath0493 with theoretical predictions .",
    "we first note that self - enrichment of carbon by dredge - up of the products of the helium burning ( e.g. , @xcite ) is clearly excluded , because bd+44@xmath0493 is an unevolved subgiant .",
    "mass transfer from a companion agb star is proposed as one of the causes of c enrichment for many cemp stars , and such a model has had great success in explaining the observed properties of cemp-_s _ stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the observed properties of bd+44@xmath0493 do not support this scenario .",
    "the first difficulty , which applies to all cemp - no stars ( by definition ) , is that the neutron - capture elements that are expected to be enhanced by an agb companion are not over - abundant in this star .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , suggested that the apparently normal ba abundances of cemp - no stars might be explained by the high neutron - to- fe - peak - element seed ratio in the _ s_-process that occurred in the agb companion , resulting in little or no ba excess , but large pb enhancement .",
    "this follows , according to @xcite , because the very large number of neutrons available per fe - peak - element seed nucleus at low metallicity forces the @xmath39-process to run to completion , and terminate on lead . under this hypothesis , the pb abundance predicted by @xcite is @xmath178 at [ fe / h ] @xmath89 , although they comment that its detection would be difficult , because of the weakness of the line , and its location in a spectral region contaminated by a  thicket of ch features . \" in this regard , we are fortunate that bd+44@xmath0493 is as bright as it is , since the high s / n spectrum we have obtained ( as well as the relatively high effective temperature ) provides the opportunity to set a meaningful upper limit , even from measurements in the optical .",
    "our measured upper limit for lead in bd+44@xmath0493 , ( @xmath177 ) , is clearly much lower than the predicted value from @xcite , @xmath179 .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility that , since a relatively high - mass companion agb star ( @xmath180 ) produces little _ s_-process elements , due to inefficient radiative @xmath140c burning , this might account for the lack of ba enrichment in cemp - no stars . however , since a high - mass agb star converts c into n via hot - bottom burning , the low n abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 permits only a narrow range of mass .",
    "another constraint is the low c / o ratio ( c / o @xmath181 ) found for bd+44@xmath0493 , which can not be explained by the agb nucleosynthesis scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the radial velocity of bd+44@xmath0493 has stayed constant since 1984 (  2.3 ) , indicating no signature of binarity ( or only allowing a binary of very long period ) .",
    "our conclusion is that the binary mass - transfer scenario is excluded as the origin of the c excess of bd+44@xmath0493 .",
    "another scenario that has been put forward , that the c enhancement occurs prior to the formation of ( at least some ) cemp stars due to the predicted mass loss from rapidly - rotating massive stars of the lowest metallicity .",
    "@xcite explored models of rapidly - rotating @xmath182 stars with total metallicities @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and found that strong internal mixing increases the total metallicity at the stellar surface significantly , leading to large mass loss in the form of a vigorous wind .",
    "the ejecta are highly enriched in cno elements , which are products of triple-@xmath86 reactions and the cno cycle .",
    "in particular , the n excess is predicted to be quite large , due to operation of the cno cycle in the h - burning shell , which converts c into n. the low observed n abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 , however , can not be accounted for by this scenario .",
    "furthermore , recent models of rotating massive stars with @xmath185 explored by @xcite , over a wide range of mass ( 9 - 200@xmath186 ) , suggest that these stars experience only relatively little mass loss , in stark contrast to that from extremely low , but non - zero , metallicity models .",
    "their results indicate that the very first generation of stars , even though they might be rapidly rotating , are unlikely to lead to cno enrichment through mass loss .    a remaining possibility is element production by so - called faint supernovae associated with the first generations of stars , which experience extensive mixing of matter and fallback onto the nascent compact object that forms at their centers during their explosions @xcite .",
    "such a process is apparently realized in relativistic jet - induced supernovae with low energy - deposition rates @xcite . since a relatively large amount of material collapses onto the central remnant in such supernovae ,",
    "only small amounts of heavy elements , such as the fe - peak elements ( which are synthesized in the inner regions of the progenitors ) can be ejected , compared to lighter elements , such as c , which are synthesized in the outer regions .",
    "thus , high [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] ratios are predicted in the ejected material . since the luminosity of supernovae is generated by the radioactive decay of @xmath187ni through @xmath187co to @xmath187fe , the small amount of @xmath187ni ejected results in the faintness of the explosion .",
    "this scenario does not produce a serious conflict with the observed elemental - abundance pattern of bd+44@xmath0493 .",
    "indeed , a faint pop iii supernova model which undergo mixing - and - fallback during the explosion can well - reproduce the abundance pattern of this object , as shown in figure  [ ap - sn ] .",
    "this model is constructed with the same method as in @xcite for a main - sequence mass of 25msun @xcite , and explosion energy of @xmath188ergs , while a normal supernova explodes with an energy of @xmath189ergs ; the ejected @xmath187ni mass is only about 10% of that for a normal supernova . since a supernova with high entropy leads to a large [ zn / fe ] ratio @xcite , our low upper limit for [ zn / fe ] for",
    "bd+44@xmath0493 may constrain the explosion energy , and favor a supernova with normal entropy .",
    "the low [ n / c ] in bd+44@xmath0493 indicates that mixing between the he convective shell and h - rich envelope during pre - supernova evolution is not significant @xcite , and in the calculation only 15% of the c in the he layer is assumed to be converted into n , in order to reproduce the abundance pattern .",
    "thus , at present , a faint supernova is the most promising candidate for the origin of the c excess in bd+44@xmath0493 .",
    "our conclusion on the origin of the c excess in bd+44@xmath0493 impacts the interpretation of the entire cemp - no class of stars .",
    "faint supernovae should have played an important role in the chemical evolution of the early galaxy , and at least some ( perhaps all ) cemp - no stars probably formed from gas polluted by them .",
    "this supports the notion that the ultra metal - poor ( ump ; [ fe / h ] @xmath190 ) and hyper metal - poor stars ( hmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath191 ) are not low - mass pop iii stars but , rather , pop ii stars that formed from gas that had been pre - enriched by high - mass pop iii stars .",
    "@xcite discussed the possible existence of two cooling channels responsible for the formation of second - generation stars from gas clouds polluted by first generations of massive stars , following the studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of them is the process responsible for non carbon - enhanced stars , which is not yet well - defined ; dust - induced cooling is a candidate .",
    "the other is the cooling by fine - structure lines of and in the case of carbon and oxygen - enhanced material .",
    "our conclusion that bd+44@xmath0493 is formed from a gas cloud pre - enriched in carbon supports the existence of this channel of emp star formation .",
    "figure  [ be - fe ] shows the be abundance upper limit for bd+44@xmath0493 in the @xmath192 vs. [ fe / h ] plane , along with the results from @xcite .",
    "our observation ( an upper limit ) is consistent with the linear trend between be and fe seen in this figure .",
    "it is of significance that the be abundance keeps decreasing and exhibits no plateau at low metallicity , at least to the level of @xmath193 .",
    "previous measurements of be for stars permitted the possibility of a be plateau around @xmath194 @xcite , which would now be clearly called into question .",
    "our analysis is the first attempt to measure a be abundance for a cemp star . since be is produced via the spallation of cno nuclei , cno abundances , especially o abundances ,",
    "have been expected to correlate with be abundances .",
    "however , our low be upper limit shows that the high c and o abundances in bd+44@xmath0493 are irrelevant to its be abundance ( figure  [ be - fe ] , lower panel ) .",
    "moreover , the origin of the c excess in cemp - no stars such as bd+44@xmath0493 , which we have argued is most likely due to faint supernovae , is unlikely to be a significant source of high - energy cno nuclei that participate in the primary spallation process expected to be associated with be production .",
    "be abundances , as well the abundances of b , in metal - poor stars are proposed to be good indicators of the ages of stars formed in the early galaxy @xcite , because they could reflect the increase of cosmic ray flux in the early galaxy , while other metals such as fe would reflect the contributions from individual supernovae , and result in a spatial inhomogeneity in the abundance ratios .",
    "our finding that be is not significantly enhanced even by the supernovae that yield large amounts of c and o , provides additional support for this hypothesis .",
    "the above discussion is , however , based on the assumption that the be abundance in bd+44@xmath0493 is not depleted during its evolution .",
    "beryllium is a fragile element , with a burning temperature of @xmath195 , higher than that of li ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "given that the li abundance of this star , @xmath197 , is much lower than the spite plateau value , we should also examine the possibility of be depletion in bd+44@xmath0493 .    in figure  [ li - teff ]",
    ", we compare the li abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 with those of other metal - poor ( @xmath20}<-1.4 $ ] ) subgiants , which are mainly taken from @xcite , as well as metal - poor dwarfs with @xmath198 . as a star evolves from the main sequence to the red giant branch , the effective temperature decreases , that is , cooler subgiants in this diagram",
    "are more evolved . at @xmath198 ,",
    "metal - poor subgiants appear to have li abundances consistent with the spite plateau values , along with the metal - poor dwarfs .",
    "the sharp decline of li abundances in the range 5700 - 5400k indicates that significant li depletion occurs when stars pass through this temperature range , often referred to as the boesgaard dip @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that their subgiants have depleted li abundances that are generally consistent with predictions from standard models of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "since the li abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 is in agreement with the values found for their sample , we conclude that the li depletion in bd+44@xmath0493 is likely to be similar to those found in their sample , even though the metallicity is remarkably lower .    in order to investigate be depletion ,",
    "we adopt [ be / fe ] as an indicator .",
    "we assume that metal - poor stars originally have be abundances in proportion to their fe abundances , as found in figure  [ be - fe ] , that is , [ be / fe ] is close to 0.2 .",
    "if be is not depleted in a subgiant , the star is expected to follow the linear correlation , and have the same [ be / fe ] value as dwarfs , while lower [ be / fe ] values suggest be depletion in the star . in figure",
    "[ be - subgiants ] , we plot [ be / fe ] versus effective temperature for metal - poor subgiants ( @xmath20}<-1.4 $ ] ; the same metallicity range as adopted for discussion on li depletion ) .",
    "it appears that objects with @xmath198 did not experience be depletion , as expected from our discussion on the li abundances in the temperature range . on the other hand , [ be / fe ] values in cool subgiants are about one order of magnitude lower , which could be interpreted as the result of be depletion .    during the subgiant phase , the stellar convection zone extends into the interior , first reaching to the li - depleted layer , and later , to the be - depleted layer , because nuclear be burning requires higher temperatures than li burning .",
    "therefore , be depletion is expected in more - evolved subgiants with lower effective temperatures than li depletion .",
    "however , this is not clearly found in figures  [ li - teff ] and [ be - subgiants ] .",
    "one reason might be the paucity of stars of the sample in the temperature range 5400 - 5700k",
    ". more measurements of li and be abundances for metal - poor subgiants in this temperature range are strongly desired in order to assess this issue .",
    "futhermore , the uncertainty in effective temperature determinations could make the difference unclear . in comparisons with the results of previous studies ,",
    "consistency of temperature determinations are essential .",
    "since bd+44@xmath0493 has an effective temperature of 5430k that falls into the range where be depletion appears to occur , it is difficult to conclude whether or not be is depleted in this star .",
    "another constraint on be depletion could be obtained from boron abundance measurements .",
    "if b is depleted in a star , be also must be depleted , because the burning temperature of b , @xmath199 , is higher than that of be .",
    "the absence of an available b line in the wavelength range that can be accessed from ground - based telescopes makes a b abundance measurement a challenge .",
    "the stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) instrument onboard the hubble space telescope is at present the only spectrograph with which we could observe the resonance lines at 2497 .",
    "abundance measurements of li , be , and b for metal - poor subgiants will offer important clues for our understanding of mixing processes in stellar interiors , which can decrease surface abundances of light elements .",
    "theoretical modeling of the depletion for a wide range of metallicity and stellar mass should also be explored .",
    "we have conducted a detailed elemental abundance analysis for the 9th magnitude emp star bd+44@xmath0493 , based on very high - quality , high - resolution optical and near - uv spectra .",
    "this object is a cemp - no star , and has exhibited no detectable radial - velocity variations over the past 24 years .",
    "the abundance patterns we measure , in particular c , n , o , as well as the heavy neutron - capture elements , suggest that the most likely origin of this object is that it was born from gas polluted by the elements produced by a faint supernova undergoing mixing and fallback , which ejected only a small amount of metals beyond c , n , and o.    recent searches for emp stars have revealed that the fraction of cemp stars among them is substantially higher than that for less metal - poor stars @xcite , and that cemp - no stars are an important contributor to these ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hmp stars he  13272326 and he  01075240 are included in this class of objects .",
    "the results for bd+44@xmath0493 suggest a very important role for faint supernovae in the earliest phase of chemical enrichment in the galaxy , and ( at least for some low - mass stars ) the importance of cooling by fine - structure lines of and in their early formation .",
    "the low observed li abundance and non - detection of be for bd+44@xmath0493 also shed new light on the production of light elements in the early galaxy .",
    "however , it remains possible that these elements could have been depleted in this star during the course of its evolution .",
    "a future ( space - based ) measurement of b for this star has particular importance to distinguish whether these effects apply or not .",
    "further measurements of li and be for subgiants with @xmath75 of about 5500  k , in which depletion of these elements first appears , are also useful for understanding the nature of light elements in emp stars .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our measured upper limit on the abundance of pb ( @xmath200(pb)@xmath15 ) rejects that possibility that the observed neutron - capture - element abundance patterns in bd+44@xmath0493 arise from the operation of a modified @xmath39-process at low metallicity in cemp - no stars .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy in the region of the uv pb line of bd+44@xmath0493 from hst / stis has recently been obtained by beers et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and can be used to confirm our estimated limit . taken at face value , our present result already provides additional strong evidence that the c and o enhancements in bd+44@xmath0493 must have originated in an astrophysical site other than agb stars , as discussed in  5.1 .",
    "additional measurements of pb from the ground and with hst / stis would be highly desirable to obtain for low - metallicity cemp - no stars , if other sufficiently bright examples are identified in the future .    w.a . and n.t . were supported by the jsps grants - in - aid for scientific research ( 23224004 ) .",

    "<S> we present detailed chemical abundances for the bright carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) star bd+44@xmath0493 , previously reported on by ito et al . our measurements confirm that bd+44@xmath0493 is an extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 ) subgiant star with excesses of carbon and oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> no significant excesses are found for nitrogen and neutron - capture elements ( the latter of which place it in the cemp - no class of stars ) . other elements that we measure exhibit abundance patterns that are typical for non - cemp extremely metal - poor stars . </S>",
    "<S> no evidence for variations of radial velocity have been found for this star . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly suggest that the carbon enhancement in bd+44@xmath0493 is unlikely to have been produced by a companion asymptotic giant - branch star and transferred to the presently observed star , nor by pollution of its natal molecular cloud by rapidly - rotating , massive , mega metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> a more likely possibility is that this star formed from gas polluted by the elements produced in a `` faint '' supernova , which underwent mixing and fallback , and only ejected small amounts of elements of metals beyond the lighter elements . the li abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 ( @xmath3(li)=@xmath4(li / h)+12@xmath5 ) is lower than the spite plateau value , as found in other metal - poor subgiants . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit on be abundance ( @xmath3(be ) = @xmath4(be / h)+12@xmath6 ) is as low as those found for stars with similarly extremely - low metallicity , indicating that the progenitors of carbon- ( and oxygen- ) enhanced stars are not significant sources of be , or that be is depleted in metal - poor subgiants with effective temperatures of @xmath75400  k. </S>"
