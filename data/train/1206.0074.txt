    "in recent years several applications of quantum nonlocality have been proposed @xcite ( see a recent review on bell nonlocality @xcite ) .",
    "these proposals are based on the fact that nonlocal correlations can be certified without any assumption on the internal mechanisms of the devices used in the experiment .",
    "thus , once established , nonlocal correlations can be used in what is now referred as , device - independent protocols .",
    "nonlocal correlations can be obtained by measuring entangled quantum systems in appropriately chosen local observables .",
    "this is called a bell test since the nonlocal nature of the measurement outcomes can be certified by the violation of certain constraints known as bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "many bell tests have been performed in the last few decades , but no nonlocal correlations have been strictly established so far .",
    "this is because all of the performed experiments suffered either from the detection loophole or the locality loophole @xcite .",
    "experiments using entangled photons have reported bell inequality violations closing separetly the locality @xcite and the detection @xcite loopholes . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection loophole has been closed with stationary systems like atoms , ions and circuits @xcite .",
    "the main technological challenge to close both loopholes simultaneously is to have both efficient detection long - distance entanglement .     in this work ,",
    "we propose an experimental setup involving available technology to implement a loophole - free bell test .",
    "it uses a single atom coupled to the field of a cavity in order to produce a specific entangled state between the atom and the light emitted by the cavity and combines efficient detection schemes on the atomic side and the coherent nature of the light field to perform hybrid detection on the photonic side @xcite .",
    "our scheme considers experimental effects neglected in previous proposals @xcite and thus puts current atom - photon systems as good candidates to demonstrate loophole - free nonlocal correlations    the paper is structured as follows : first , we introduce the target state and the measurement settings used in the bell test .",
    "we then give an explanation of how this state can be produced by means of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) techniques and discuss the relevant and feasible parameter regime which yields the desired state .",
    "we also discuss an implementation of our scheme in optical cavities , and optimize the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite violation for currently available experimental parameters .",
    "finally , we discuss possible circuit qed implementations in the final section and compare our proposal to previous ones .",
    "our proposal takes advantage of two facts first noticed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , highly efficient detections are typically available for the electronic levels of single atoms @xcite . at the same time , photons propagating either in free space or in low loss optical fibers are excellent candidates for carriers of information over long distances .",
    "furthermore , the combination of high efficient homodyne detection with photodetection greatly reduces the required minimum photodetection efficiency @xcite . our starting point is to consider a state of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are two atomic states and @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote states of the electromagnetic field ( vacuum and a coherent state respectively ) with @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the energy eigenstates of the field .",
    "as we are going to see , this state violates a bell inequality even for low efficiency photodetection and can be well approximated with current technology .",
    "although we motivated this work by considering a real atom , the state ( [ eqn : target_state ] ) can be in principle devised using different platforms , _ e.g. _ , superconducting qubits , quantum dots , nitrogen - vacancy center and equivalent systems .",
    "we consider the chsh bell inequality @xcite which states that the correlations obtained are nonlocal if the following inequality is violated : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quantum state under scrutiny and @xmath9 denotes the bell operator @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being observables with outcomes @xmath13 . here",

    "the cavity is asymmetric with decay rates of the mirrors @xmath48 and the cavity decay rate @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the field leaks out of the cavity essentially only through the right mirror ( cf .",

    "the fact that one needs an asymmetric cavity is not _ a priori _ obvious and will be explained below .",
    "we assume that the level @xmath2 is detuned far enough such that it does not interact with the cavity field .",

    "an alternative is to apply a displacement on the transmitted field @xcite .",

    "the other part of the split pulse passes through an auxiliary cavity ( upper branch ) which is used to produce a pulse with the same spectral properties as that produced when the atom is in the @xmath2 state .",

    "both beam splitters have the property that @xmath74 .",
    "after the state preparation , the photonic part of the state goes to a location that , given the times necessary for choosing the measurement and registering the results , assures space - like separation , and is submitted to either photodetection or homodyne measurement .",

    "note that , in order to satisfy the condition @xmath71 , the spatiotemporal modes of the two coherent states @xmath75 and @xmath76 must be identical .",
    "this can be achieved e.g. by using an auxiliary cavity similar to the one containing the atom ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) , where @xmath77 .",
    "eventually , instead of using the auxiliary cavity , one might look for an atom - cavity - laser configuration in which the coupling of the field of polarization connecting the @xmath2 state with some excited state is negligible compared to the dispersive coupling of the @xmath44 transition , and the orthogonal polarization coupling to neither @xmath2 or @xmath1 or @xmath78 . in such a situation one might use this field to produce the displacement pulse using only a single cavity .    the problem of an input coherent pulse with frequency spectrum @xmath79 and amplitude @xmath54 impinging on a atom - cavity system can be treated using input - output theory @xcite ( see methods for details ) .",

    "the second condition is precisely the requirement of the asymmetric cavity we have mentioned at the beginning of this section and is dependent only on the transmission and losses of the cavity mirrors used . for completeness",
    ", we have also included non - radiative mirror losses .",
    "the third condition means that one needs large single - atom cooperativity .",
    "one remarkable feature of this result is that for @xmath104 , the visibility @xmath86 ( but of course not the state ) is independent of the details of the spectrum of the input pulse .",
    "the final point to note is that to satisfy the approximations used in our derivation , we require a negligible probability of exciting the atom throughout the duration of the input pulse .",
    "this is important , since , to maintain some specific amplitude of the output coherent state @xmath91 after the beam splitter , one might have to use a very large amplitude input laser if the integral in equation is small . for the sake of this theoretical analysis , we consider the case of an input gaussian pulse with the normalized spectrum @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the central laser frequency , and @xmath107 is the bandwidth of the pulse .    to close the locality loophole , one has to propagate the outgoing pulse for some minimum distance , given by the larger of the measurement times of the atom and the pulse , which depends on the pulse duration .",
    "the pulse duration is given by the relevant time scale of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ , either by the input pulse duration or the cavity lifetime , whichever is greater .",
    "this means that , from the point of view of closing the locality loophole , it is useful to push the duration of the input pulse down to the cavity lifetime , but not necessarily further .",
    "since the pulse duration and the cavity lifetime are proportional to the inverse of the pulse bandwidth @xmath107 and the cavity decay rate @xmath108 respectively , the best case would be if @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig : validity ] shows plots of @xmath110 , the maximum probability of exciting the atom as a function of the parameter @xmath111 ( the coupling strength over the total cavity decay rate ) , assuming that the central laser frequency is on resonance with the bare cavity , for @xmath112 .",
    "the left figure is the case for a fixed minimal bandwidth of the input pulse in the sense that we choose @xmath107 such that @xmath113 .",
    "the right figure corresponds to the situation when the input pulse bandwidth is set equal to the cavity bandwidth in order to minimize the pulse duration . in the following",
    ", we will consider the regions where @xmath114 , to be the parameter regimes when our analysis is suitable . as is evident from fig .",

    "we can thus look for some intermediate value of @xmath107 ( having all the other parameters fixed ) , which minimizes the pulse duration while still respecting the validity of the used approximation .",
    "this is the strategy we employ in the next section , where we will discuss a possible implementation of our scheme using realistic experimental parameters .",
    "so far , we theoretically described a general cavity scenario . in the following",
    ", we will focus our attention on possible implementations of our scheme in optical cavities .",
    "this implementation has the advantage of allowing large propagation distances due to the availability of low loss optical fibers .",
    "we start by general constraints on measurement times and propagation distances imposed by the locality loophole . to close the locality loophole ,",
    "one requires the start of the measurement event on one side to be space - like separated from the end of the measurement event on the other side . in other words , we need that the space - time coordinates of the end of the atomic measurement and the choice of measurement basis ( photon detection or homodyning ) on the photonic side be space - like separated , and vice versa .",
    "this constraint translates into the minimum propagation distance @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the speed of light in free - space , @xmath120 is the time required on the atomic / photonic side to choose the measurement settings , which also includes the time to change the measurement basis , @xmath121 is the time required on the atomic / photonic side to perform the actual measurement , which necessarily includes the duration of the light pulse .",
    "we assume that the main time constraint is set by the atomic measurement , which is typically slower than the measurement of photons .",
    "the above equation shows , that even if we used a very short pulse , we would still need to propagate it at least to a distance , given by the sum of atomic measurement time and the time required to choose a basis ( a rotation in the space of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , typically using rf pulses ) , multiplied by @xmath119 .",
    "the best trade - off in this case , is thus to have @xmath122 .",
    "this is possible because the time needed to choose a basis on the photonic side can be very fast @xcite .",
    "one possibility to perform a fast atomic state detection would be to use a 2-photon ionization technique @xcite .",
    "this technique has been performed in free - space configurations and can achieve 98% efficiency in < .",
    "although the restriction of a small cavity might make such a photo - ionization technique technically challenging , proposals to make focusing cavities with large physical volumes ( lengths of @xmath123 1 cm ) while still maintaining large coupling constants ( @xmath124 100mhz ) exist @xcite potentially making such techniques compatible . here , we assume @xmath125",
    ". we should thus seek to produce a pulse which requires a total measurement duration up to .",
    "for the gaussian pulse example considered in our calculation , we take the total pulse measurement duration to be @xmath126 .",
    "the factor @xmath127 is chosen such that if the bandwidth of the pulse incident on the cavity is @xmath128 , then the neglected tails of the outgoing pulse correspond to < 0.5% of the total integrated intensity of the outgoing pulse ( for the parameters used in table [ tab : parameters ] , see below ) . for a measurement time of @xmath129 , this corresponds to @xmath130 .",
    "it also means that for outgoing pulse bandwidths @xmath131 ( shorter pulses ) , the total measurement time is set by @xmath132 and the minimum propagation distance is 300 m.    next , we use experimental parameters given in @xcite . these experiments use and light respectively , which are subject to about loss in optical fibers . in the following ,",
    "we compare both experiments and possible modifications .",
    "as discussed previously , we will work in the large detuning regime , @xmath133 .",
    "we choose an arbitrary , but subjected to experimental constraints , value of @xmath134 .",
    "this ensures that we respect all approximations used , as long as we also satisfy condition @xmath135 .",
    "the figure of merit in both cases will be @xmath136 , which is the largest acceptable laser bandwidth that satisfies condition @xmath137 , and the state production visibility , which is computed using the actual laser bandwidth @xmath138 .",

    ", one may also consider circuit qed setups .",
    "the advantages of such setups are twofold .",
    "first , the very fast and efficient qubit state detection , on the order of @xcite potentially lowers the required propagation distances to laboratory scale distances ( or less ) .",
    "second , in this system , large ratios of coupling constant to cavity decay , @xmath116 , can be achieved .",
    "the drawbacks with current technology are the limited efficiencies of both photodetection and homodyne detection ( private communication with steve girvin ) , and the requirement to cool the propagation line down to cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the hope is that both these drawbacks , being of technological nature , can be eventually overcome in near future experiments .    before finishing let us compare our present results with previous proposals involving similar setups . in ref .",
    "@xcite a bell test involving the production of an entangled state between an atom and a photonic field created by atomic decay was studied ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that bell violations with photodetection efficiency of @xmath164 ( see green curve in fig .  [ comparison ] ) can be achieved .",
    "note however that this number refers to the ideal state , considering that all light emitted by the atom is collected .",
    "our scheme overcomes this problem since the photonic part of the state is the transmitted mode , and , moreover , requires lower efficiencies .",
    "we believe that our proposal will trigger possible implementations of loophole - free bell tests with atom - photon interfaces , which are particularly important in quantum communication and cryptographic applications .",
    "here we derive the input - output relations @xcite for a two - sided cavity , clearly stating the approximations used , and their validity .",
    "we consider a cavity mode ( @xmath20 mode ) which couples to a left mode ( @xmath26 mode ) and a right mode ( @xmath119 mode ) .",
    "we also include loss in the mirrors of the cavity as the coupling of the cavity @xmath20 mode to an additional @xmath165 mode . + these give the following heisenberg equation of motion for the cavity field , @xmath166 } - \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } a(t ) { } { \\nonumber}\\\\    & { } + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm b}}b_{\\rm in}(t ) + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm c}}c_{\\rm in}(t ) + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm l}}l_{\\rm in}(t ) , \\label{aeqn : starting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the system hamiltonian ( empty cavity or cavity with atom ) without considering the baths , which is either @xmath169 equation",

    ", one has to include atomic spontaneous emission .",
    "this can be done by including the coupling of the @xmath44 transition to an additional bath , @xmath175 mode , different from the cavity .",
    "this gives the set of equations @xmath176 } - \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } a(t ) { } { \\nonumber}\\\\    & { } + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm b}}b_{\\rm in}(t ) + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm c}}c_{\\rm in}(t ) + \\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm l}}l_{\\rm in}(t ) , \\\\",

    "note that @xmath95 can be made small if the physical cavity mode has a large spatial overlap with the emission pattern of the @xmath44 transition .    in the following ,",
    "we will investigate the system dynamics in the low excitation regime .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , we want to avoid exciting the atom in order to prevent the decay into the environment ( spontaneous emission with the decay rate @xmath95 ) .",
    "second , populating the excited state would induce a more complex dynamics producing in general a nontrivial entangled state between the atom and input , output and cavity fields .",
    "this is certainly an interesting regime to investigate in the context of quantum state engineering , but in the present paper we focus on the more intuitive picture in the spirit of ( [ eqn : principle ] ) .",
    "the assumption of the atom occupying mostly the ground state can be translated as @xmath178 . with this assumption ,",
    "the above set of equations can be solved analytically .",
    "proceeding analogously to the empty cavity case , we have @xmath179 where the unitary matrix @xmath180 with @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 is defined in equation , the vector @xmath184 reads @xmath185 and d ( ) = ( + i _ a)(+i_c)+g^2 . notice that this set of equations reduces to for the @xmath26 and @xmath119 modes , when @xmath186 .",
    "finally , we also assume that all output operators ( @xmath187 ) commute with each other , which is not true in general .",
    "this approximation is required , for an input coherent field in the @xmath188 mode to transform into a coherent reflected field in the @xmath189 mode and coherent fields in the @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 modes .",
    "lastly , as a consistency check of our work , we note that the approximation @xmath178 necessarily requires that the atom remains in the ground state throughout its evolution . solving for @xmath193 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath194 where we have used the fact that the @xmath195 and @xmath177 modes represent thermal noise and are thus taken to be negligible compared to the @xmath188 mode . taking the inverse fourier transform , one obtains @xmath196 we then conclude that the self - consistency of our approximation requires that @xmath197 , @xmath198 , which implies that @xmath199 . notice that this condition is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the approximation @xmath178 , since this condition itself is derived under the approximation .",
    "however , it should be noted that equation can be written in terms of @xmath200 to obtain @xmath201 then , for @xmath202 , meaning that if the laser addresses only wavelengths close to the bare cavity resonance compared to the detuning between the atom and the cavity , and the atom - cavity detuning is many atomic linewidths away from resonance , one has the condition @xmath203 which is the condition of validity of the dispersive approximation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the condition @xmath204 , together with condition @xmath199 , is sufficient to justify the approximation @xmath178 .",
    "the state produced after the cavity and beam splitter is of the form @xmath205 where o , b , l and e are the other port of the beam splitter , the reflected field from the cavity , the field loss in cavity mirrors and the spontaneous emission term respectively . if we measure only the atomic state and the @xmath20 mode , we lose information in all the other modes .",
    "tracing over all the rest of the modes , we obtain the state , where the visibility , @xmath86 is , @xmath206 we take only the magnitude of the inner products , since the total phase can , in principle , be compensated by suitable atomic state preparation .",
    "this gives the expression @xmath87 , \\label{eqn : v_app } \\\\",

    "<S> are the use of atom - photon entanglement and hybrid photonic measurements ( _ eg . </S>",
    "<S> _ photo - detection and homodyning ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have suggested that the use of atom - photon entanglement can lead to bell inequality violations with moderate transmission and detection efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> here we combine these ideas and propose an experimental setup realizing a simple atom - photon entangled state that can be used to obtain nonlocality when considering realistic experimental parameters including detection efficiencies and losses due to required propagation distances . </S>"
