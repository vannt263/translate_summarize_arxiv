    "the applications of pedestrians dynamics range from the safety of large events to the planning of towns with a view to pedestrian comfort . because of the computational effort involved with an experimental analysis of the complex collective system of pedestrians behavior , computer simulations are run .",
    "models continuous in space are one possibility to describe this complex collective system .    in developing a model , we prefer to start with the simplest case : single lane movement .",
    "if the model is able to reproduce reality quantitatively and qualitatively for that simple case , it is a good candidate for adaption to complex two - dimensional conditions .    also in single file movement pedestrians interact in many ways and not all factors , which have an effect on their behavior , are known .",
    "therefore , we follow three different modeling approaches in this work . all of them underlie diverse concepts in the simulation of human behavior .",
    "+ this study is a continuation and enlargement of the validation introduced in @xcite . for validation , we introduce two criteria : on the one hand",
    ", the relation between velocity and density has to be described correctly .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled , if the modeled data reproduce the fundamental diagram . on the other hand",
    ", we are aiming to reproduce the appearance of collective effects . a characteristic effect for the single file movement are stop - and - go waves as they are observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "we obtained all empirical data from several experiments of the single file movement .",
    "there a corridor with circular guiding was built , so that it possessed periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the density was varied by increasing the number of the involved pedestrians . for more information about the experimental set - up ,",
    "see @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the first two models investigated are force based and the dynamics are given by the following system of coupled differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the force acting on pedestrian @xmath2 .",
    "the mass is denoted by @xmath3 , the velocity by @xmath4 and the current position by @xmath5 .",
    "this approach derives from sociology @xcite . here",
    "psychological forces define the movement of humans through their living space .",
    "this approach is transferred to pedestrians dynamics and so @xmath1 is split to a repulsive force @xmath6 and a driven force @xmath7 . in our case",
    "the driving force is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the desired velocity of a pedestrian and @xmath10 their reaction time .",
    "the other model is event driven .",
    "a pedestrian can be in different states . a change between these states",
    "is called event .",
    "the calculation of the velocity of each pedestrian is straightforward and depends on these states .",
    "the first spatially continuous model was developed by helbing and molnr @xcite and has often been modified . according to @xcite the repulsive force for pedestrian @xmath2 is defined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 , \\tau=0.2\\ , [ s]$ ] and @xmath13 is the distance between pedestrians @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "the fluctuation parameter @xmath15 represents the noise of the system . in two - dimensional scenes ,",
    "this parameter is used to create jammed states and lane formations @xcite . in this study",
    ", we are predominantly interested in the modeled relation between velocity and density for single file movement .",
    "therefore the fluctuation parameter has no influence and is ignored .",
    "first tests of this model indicated that the forces are too strong , leading to unrealistically high velocities . due to this",
    "it is necessary to limit the velocity to @xmath16 , as it is done in @xcite @xmath17 in our simulation we set @xmath18 $ ] .      in this",
    "model pedestrians possess a degree of foresight , in addition to the current state of a pedestrian at time step @xmath19 .",
    "this approach considers an extrapolation of the velocity to time step @xmath20 . for it",
    "@xcite employs the linear relation between the velocity and the distance of a pedestrian @xmath2 to the one in front @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 for @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] this reproduces the empirical data .",
    "so with ( [ v(d ) ] ) @xmath25 can be calculated from @xmath26 which itself is a result of the extrapolation of the current state @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the repulsive force is defined as @xmath29 obviously the impact of the desired velocity @xmath9 in the driven force is negated by the one in the repulsive term . after some simulation time , the system reaches an equilibrium in which all pedestrians walk with the same velocity . in order to spread the values and keep the right relation between velocity and density , we added a fluctuation parameter @xmath30 . @xmath30",
    "uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath31 $ ] reproduced the scatter observed in the empirical data .      in this model pedestrians",
    "are treated as hard bodies with a diameter @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the diameter depends linearly on the current velocity and is equal to the step length @xmath33 in addition to the safety distance @xmath34 @xmath35 based on @xcite the step length is a linear function of the current velocity with following parameters : @xmath36 + 0.302\\ , [ s ] \\,v_i(t ) \\enspace .\\ ] ] @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be specified through empirical data and the inverse relation of ( [ v(d ) ] ) . here",
    "@xmath37 is the required space for a stationary pedestrian and @xmath38 affects the velocity term . for @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] the last equations ( [ d_i ] ) and ( [ st_i ] )",
    "can be summarized to @xmath41 + 0.758\\ , [ s ] \\ , v_i(t)\\enspace .\\ ] ] by solving the differential equation @xmath42 the velocity function is obtained .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with the parameters of the pedestrians movement .",
    "a pedestrian is accelerating to their desired velocity @xmath9 until the distance to the pedestrian in front is smaller than the safety distance . from this time on , he / she is decelerating until the distance is larger than the safety distance and so on . via @xmath43 and @xmath44 those events could be defined : deceleration ( [ bremsen ] ) and acceleration ( [ beschleunigen ] ) .    to ensure good performance for high densities ,",
    "no events are explicitly calculated .",
    "but in each time step , it is checked whether an event has taken place and @xmath45 or @xmath46 are set to @xmath19 accordingly .",
    "the time step , @xmath47 , of @xmath48 seconds is chosen , so that a reaction time is automatically included .",
    "the discrete time step could lead to configurations where overlapping occurs . to guarantee volume exclusion , case ( [ stoppen ] ) is included , in which the pedestrians are too close to each other and have to stop",
    "for the comparison of the modeled and experimental data , it is important to use the same method of measurement .",
    "@xcite shows that the results from different measurement methods vary considerably .",
    "the velocity @xmath4 is calculated by the entrance and exit times @xmath50 and @xmath51 to two meter section .",
    "@xmath52}{(t_i^{out}-t_i^{in})[s]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to avoid discrete values of the density leading to a large scatter , we define the density by @xmath53 where @xmath54 gives the fraction to which the space between pedestrian @xmath2 and @xmath55 is inside the measured section , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 is the mean value of all @xmath57 , where @xmath19 is in the interval @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "we use the same method of measurement for the modeled and empirical data .",
    "the fundamental diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fd ] , where @xmath59 is the number of the pedestrians .",
    "the velocities of the social force model are independent of the systems density and nearly equal to the desired velocity @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "additionally we observe a backward movement of the pedestrians and pair formation . because of",
    "these unrealistic phenomena are not observed in the other models , we suggest that this is caused by the combination of long - range forces and periodic boundary conditions .    in contrast , the model with foresight results in a fundamental diagram in good agreement with the empirical one . through the fluctuation parameter ,",
    "the values of the velocities and densities vary as in the experimental data .",
    "we are satisfied with the results of the adaptive velocity model . for reducing computing time",
    ", we also tested a linear adaptive velocity function , leading to a @xmath61 decrease in computing time for @xmath62 pedestrians .",
    "the fundamental diagram for this linear adaptive velocity function is not shown , but also reproduces the empirical one .",
    "during the experiments of the single file movement , we observed stop - and - go waves at densities higher than two pedestrians per meter , see fig . 5 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we compare the experimental trajectories with the modeled ones for global densities of one , two and three persons per meter . the results are shown in fig.[ges ] . since the social force model is not able to satisfy the criterion for the right relation between velocity and density , we omit this model in this section . figure [ ges ] shows the trajectories for global average densities of one , two and three persons per meter . from left",
    "to right the data of the model with foresight , the adaptive velocity model and the experiment are shown .    in the experimental data , it is clearly visible that the trajectories get unsteadier with increasing density . at a density of one person per meter",
    "pedestrians stop for the first time .",
    "so a jam is generated . at a density of two persons per meter stop - and - go waves",
    "pass through the whole measurement range . at densities greater than three persons per meter pedestrians can hardly move forward .",
    "for the extraction of the empirical trajectories , the pedestrians heads were marked and tracked .",
    "sometimes , there is a backward movement in the empirical trajectories caused by self - dynamic of the pedestrians heads .",
    "this dynamic is not modeled and so the other trajectories have no backward movement .",
    "this has to be accounted for in the comparison .    by adding the fluctuation parameter @xmath63 $ ] to the model with foresight a good agreement with experiment",
    "is obtained for densities of one and two persons per meter .",
    "the irregularities caused by this parameter are equal to the irregularities of the pedestrians dynamic .",
    "nevertheless , this does not suffice for stopping so that stop - and - go waves appear , fig.[vor2 ] and fig.[vor3 ] .    with the adaptive velocity model",
    "stop - and - go waves already arise at a density of one pedestrian per meter , something that is not seen in experimental data .",
    "however , this model characterizes higher densities well . so in comparison with fig .",
    "[ ed3 ] and fig .",
    "[ emp3 ] the stopping - phase of the modeled data seems to last for the same time as in the empirical data .",
    "but there are clearly differences in the acceleration phase , the adaptive velocity models acceleration is much lower than seen in experiment .",
    "finally other studies of stop - and - go waves have to be carried out .",
    "the occurrence of this phenomena has to be clearly understood for further model modifications .",
    "therefore it is necessarry to measure e. g. the size of the stop - and - go wave at a fixed position .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to measure over a time interval , because the empirical trajectories are only available in a specific range of 4 meters .",
    "the well - known and often used social force model is unable to reproduce the fundamental diagram . the model with foresight provides a good quantitative reproduction of the fundamental diagram .",
    "however , it has to be modified further , so that stop - and - go waves could be generated as well .",
    "the model with adaptive velocities follows a simple and effective event driven approach . with the included reaction time , it is possible to create stop - and - go waves without unrealistic phenomena , like overlapping or interpenetrating pedestrians .",
    "all models are implemented in c and run on a simple pc .",
    "they were also tested for their computing time in case of large system with upto 10000 pedestrians .",
    "the social force model offers a complexity level of @xmath64 , whereas the other models only have a level of @xmath65 . for this reason the social force model is not qualified for modeling such large systems .",
    "both other models are able to do this , where the maximal computing time is one sixth of the simulated time .    in the future",
    ", we plan to include steering of pedestrians . for these models",
    "more criteria , like the reproduction of flow characteristics at bottlenecks , are necessarry .",
    "further we are trying to get a deeper insight into to occurrence of stop - and - go waves ."
