    "a subset ( @xmath4 ) of the members of moderate redshift galaxy clusters have abnormally blue colors ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , coined the `` butcher - oemler effect '' .",
    "spectroscopy ( e.g.  @xcite ) of these galaxies confirms cluster membership and shows spectral features such as balmer absorption lines , indicating the presence of a post starburst population , or / and strong narrow emission lines , indicating ongoing active star formation or an agn .",
    "elliptical or s0 galaxies with strong balmer absorption features in their spectra are commonly denoted e+a galaxies . both for the butcher - oemler clusters ( @xcite ) and more distant ones ( @xcite ; @xcite ) many of the blue galaxies are spirals , a population which is relatively rare in nearby rich clusters . the discovery ( @xcite , @xcite ) of e+a and non - spiral emission line galaxies in the coma cluster , but at a redshift of only @xmath5 rather than the @xmath6 of the butcher - oemler clusters , makes it possible to study in greater detail the processes resulting in star formation in clusters .",
    "the mid and far infrared luminosity is a particularly useful measure in the study of galaxy evolution because it is a diagnostic of recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "the iso satellite ( @xcite ) has allowed us to observe the mid - infrared outputs of galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "of the 182 early - type galaxies surveyed with spectroscopy from the coma cluster ( by @xcite and @xcite ) , 20 showed balmer absorption features or narrow emission lines . in this paper",
    "we present iso observations at @xmath7 m of seven of these 20 galaxies and include one control or ` normal ' cluster galaxy lacking these spectral features .",
    "one additional late - type galaxy ( d100 ) appears in the same field as one of the post starburst or e+a galaxies ( d99 ) .",
    "ultimately the rate of star formation in any environment must be related to the availability of cold gas from which stars can form .",
    "the hierarchical picture of cluster formation holds that this reservoir of gas is replenished by spiral galaxies coming into the cluster .",
    "merging of subclusters or infalling galaxy groups would then result in a period of elevated star formation in the cluster galaxies .",
    "star formation in individual galaxies is triggered by the cluster tidal field , perturbations from nearby galaxies ( also referred to as galaxy harrassment ; @xcite ) , or interactions with the intracluster medium .",
    "incoming galaxies are expected to have an initial burst of star formation , after which galaxy harrassment and the cluster tidal field result in stripping , heating of the stellar velocity dispersion , and possibly a lower level of continuing star formation over a longer timescale ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these processes are expected to take place in high redshift clusters . however , even if major mergers of gas rich subclusters are common in the higher redshift clusters , it would be difficult to separate individual cluster infall events .",
    "evidence for such a merger is present in the coma cluster : it has two major ellipticals and two peaks in the x - ray flux density and radio source counts ( @xcite ) , one of which is associated with a number of galaxies with e+a and emission line spectral characteristics ( @xcite ) .",
    "kinematic differences observed in the galaxy populations can be interpreted in terms of interactions between the subcluster and the main body of the cluster and the later infall of field galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the association of e+a galaxies with cluster sub - structure would be consistent with an initial star formation burst period beginning about a gyr ago when the subclusters first began to interact .",
    "the possibility of a merger can be probed further by examining the star formation histories of these individual `` abnormal '' coma galaxies .    by comparing current star formation rates estimated with our iso observations with those @xmath8 gyr ago estimated from the balmer absorption lines we can study the recent star formation histories in these galaxies .",
    "our sample consists of a representative group of coma cluster galaxies with `` abnormal '' spectral features such as balmer absorption lines or / and emission lines . from their star formation histories",
    "we can estimate timescales for star formation in the cluster associated with a triggering event such as the infall of a sub - cluster .",
    "iras and iso studies of clusters have resulted in detection of extended far infrared emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "part of this emission has been attributed to intracluster dust , as modeled by @xcite to be consistent with reports of possible extinction through the coma cluster .",
    "the spatial resolutions of iras and iso were not sufficient to determine whether the cluster far infrared emission is smoothly distributed , as expected from intracluster dust , or associated with individual galaxies .",
    "recent observational surveys of the coma cluster in the radio ( @xcite ) and h@xmath2 emission ( @xcite ) and the compiled iras identifications of @xcite make it possible to determine the infrared luminosity function and estimate the cluster luminosity .",
    "here we investigate the possibility that galaxies in the cluster are the dominant source of infrared emission and could result in the color signature that has been attributed to intracluster dust ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the 12@xmath0 m iso observations of the galaxies . to determine whether the 12@xmath0 m flux density is above",
    "that expected from a quiescent old stellar population we also observed these galaxies at k band ( 2.2@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the 12 and 2.2@xmath0 m flux densities are compared in  3.1 and the set of galaxies with enhanced 12@xmath0 m emission is identified . in ",
    "3.2 we check our estimates for the far infrared luminosities by comparing the 12@xmath0 m flux densities of our brightest galaxies to iras or radio flux densities .    in  4.1 star formation histories for these galaxies are discussed .",
    "we compare the current star formation rate estimated from the infrared emission to that derived from h@xmath2 emission .",
    "we then compare the current star formation rates to the past rates inferred from the balmer absorption lines .",
    "we identify two groups of galaxies in our sample : those having current star formation rates that are substantially lower than that required to form their @xmath8 gyr old populations and those with significant ongoing star formation or / and agn activity .",
    "we then compare the spatial and velocity distribution of the two groups . in ",
    "4.2 by considering number counts of radio sources , iras identifications and h@xmath2 detections we constrain the form of the far infrared luminosity function of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "we then estimate the total far infrared luminosity of the coma cluster . in  4.3 we discuss the complications in measuring emission by intracluster dust because of the large contribution by cluster galaxies . in  4.4",
    "we re - examine the luminosity evolution of cluster galaxies using measurements of distant clusters from @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper , we refer to galaxies by ngc number or , when they have none , by their @xcite catalog or d number .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "images of 9 fields each centered on a coma cluster galaxy were taken with isocam ( @xcite ) in the imaging mode with @xmath11 per pixel and using the lw10 filter ( 8.6 - 14.4@xmath0 m ) . each field",
    "was observed for a total of 115 exposures each 5.04s long , taken in a @xmath12 raster on the sky , offsetting by @xmath13 between points .",
    "each point was observed for a total of @xmath14 seconds with additional time for stabilization on the first position .",
    "the total integration time per galaxy was 9.7 minutes .",
    "in each set of observations , we discarded the first 15 of 115 exposures because the array had not yet stabilized .",
    "based on the subsequent flat level of the sky , we judged the array to be stabilized after this time .",
    "cosmic ray glitches were removed using the ` mm ' multi - resolution spatial and temporal routine in the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) package .",
    "because of the extended total integration time , low frequency noise was observed in each pixel . to suppress this noise",
    ", we removed slowly varying third order polynomials in time from each pixel signal , excluding locations of bright source emission . following this procedure ,",
    "flat fields were constructed from the images themselves using an interpolator program to fit a smooth function of time to the entire data cube .",
    "the final mosaic was then constructed from the nine mosaic positions with a least - squares fit to each pixel in the images , after shifting them according to position on the sky .",
    "the final images are shown in figure 1 .",
    "images were flux calibrated using sensitivity parameters listed in later versions of the isocam data pipeline that are probably accurate to within @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the images used were observed after the array stabilized , the calibration should be accurate to this level .",
    "the resulting images have a pixel to pixel standard deviation of @xmath16 mjy per @xmath17 pixel in the central @xmath18 pixels . by removing some of the low frequency noise from the images we decreased the pixel to pixel standard deviation by a factor of @xmath19 from the automatic analysis product",
    ".      near - infrared j and k@xmath20 broad band images were obtained on may 8 , 1998 at the 90@xmath21 ( 2.3 m ) bok telescope on kitt peak with a @xmath22 nicmos3 near - infrared camera .",
    "on source total exposure times in each filter were 8 minutes for ngc 4865 , 4 minutes for ngc 4853 and 9 minutes for the remaining galaxies .",
    "observing conditions were photometric so images were calibrated by comparing to standards from @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry is listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath23 diameter apertures were used to measure the j - k color .",
    "k band magnitudes were measured in a larger @xmath13 aperture , with nearby stars and galaxies removed , to compare to the flux densities observed at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "the near - ir j - k colors are typical of normal galaxies , except in the case of d45 which is significantly bluer than the other galaxies , indicating the presence of younger stellar population or a lower metallicity .",
    "in the 12@xmath0 m images ( displayed in fig .  1 ) , 6 of 9 galaxies are clearly detected at a level of greater than a mjy .",
    "we also observed the control ( or normal ) galaxy , ngc  4865 , as well as a bright e+a galaxy which had been detected at longer wavelengths with iras , ngc  4853 .",
    "detected galaxies were seen at different locations in the data cube so we are confident that we are not misinterpreting cosmic ray hits . because of the remarkable pointing performance of iso ( absolute pointing error less than a few arcsecs , @xcite ) we are confident that the images are centered at the positions of the galaxies .",
    "all detected galaxies except for d99 and d100 were located at the center of the image .",
    "the galaxies d99 and d100 are @xmath24 apart and so can be viewed in the same image , which is centered on d99 .",
    "however the bright source detected in the 12@xmath0 m image is to the north - west of the center of the image and so at the expected location of d100 not d99 .",
    "this source is therefore probably d100 , which has narrow emission lines indicating active ongoing star - formation as well as balmer absorption features , rather than the more quiescent post starburst d99 , which has only balmer absorption features ( @xcite ) .",
    "fluxes at 12@xmath0 m measured from these images are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the brighter sources at 12@xmath0 m ( d16 , d100 , ngc  4865 and ngc  4853 ) are clearly extended even at the resolution of our @xmath17 pixels .",
    "to illustrate , we have included a point source in fig .  1 for comparison to the galaxies .",
    "the fainter galaxies ( in b band ; all but ngc  4865 and ngc  4853 ) have scale lengths ( measured in b band images ) of @xmath25 kpc or a few arcseconds whereas ngc  4853 has a larger scale length of @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the galaxies have similar extent in the mid infrared and blue .",
    "d16 , d44 , d45 , d94 , d99 , d100 and d112 all have similar luminosities in b band ( see table 1 ) . of this group , the galaxies with narrow emission lines ( d16 , d44 , d45 and d100 ) as well as balmer absorption features",
    "were clearly detected at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "the brighter galaxy , ngc  4853 , also has faint narrow emission lines as well as balmer absorption features ( @xcite ) and is detected at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "of the galaxies lacking emission lines ( the purely post starburst e+a galaxies d94 , d99 , and d112 ) , none were clearly detected .",
    "bright pixels at the expected location of these latter galaxies are observed in all three images ; however the detection is statistically significant only for d112 .",
    "a bright pixel coincident with this galaxy was observed in more than one place in the data cube and the net signal in the final image is 3 times above the standard deviation of the pixel to pixel noise fluctuations in the central @xmath27 pixels .",
    "we tentatively say we have detected d112 at the level of 0.4 mjy and we have not detected d99 and d94 with upper limits on the flux densities of 0.3 mjy .    to determine if the galaxies have excess 12@xmath0 m emission , we compare the @xmath28 m to @xmath29 m flux density ratio with that expected from an old quiescent stellar population .",
    "ngc  4865 is a control galaxy for our sample and has no balmer absorption features ( @xcite ) ; it has a flux density ratio @xmath30 , which is typical of early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  4853 , d16 , d44 , d45 and d100 are significantly brighter at 12@xmath0 m ( compared to their 2.2@xmath0 m flux densities ) than such galaxies .",
    "much of the uv emission exciting the low ionization narrow emission lines in these galaxies appears to be reradiated by dust at longer ( infrared ) wavelengths .",
    "d16 has high excitation narrow emission lines , no balmer absorption features and a broad h@xmath2 component , and so is likely to be a seyfert 1 galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its luminosity at 12@xmath0 m would probably support this interpretation ; however , the 12@xmath0 m emission is extended so it is likely that there is some active star formation occurring in this galaxy as well .",
    "d44 is intermediate in emission line characteristics , between a liner and a seyfert 2 ( @xcite ) , and is not bright enough that we can determine whether it is extended at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "the pure post starburst galaxies d94 , d99 and d112 ( lacking narrow emission lines ) have 2.2 to 12@xmath0 m flux density ratios ( or limits in the case of d94 and d99 ) consistent with expectations for old stellar populations .",
    "in such galaxies , the 12@xmath0 m emission scales with the @xmath28 m emission and so likely originates from thick dusty interstellar envelopes that form around red giant stars due to mass loss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the pure e+a phase corresponds to a later ( or post ) starburst phase where the brightest , most massive stars have already left the main sequence and correspondingly the reradiated infrared flux is low .",
    "the coma cluster e+a galaxy ngc  4853 was detected with iras with @xmath31 jy , and @xmath32 jy , giving @xmath33 .",
    "it was not detected at shorter wavelengths , but from our observed 12@xmath0 m flux density , we find that @xmath34 .",
    "this comparison with iras is valid , since the galaxy scale length is @xmath26 ( @xcite ) and we expect little extended emission past what we see in our 12@xmath0 m image .",
    "the ratio @xmath35 is also consistent with the mean value of the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xcite ) and the 12@xmath0 m normal galaxy sample of @xcite .",
    "thus , both the mid and far infrared colors of ngc  4853 are typical of a normal spiral galaxy .",
    "ngc  4853 and d100 are included in the list of optical identifications of radio sources in the coma cluster ( of @xcite ) . at 1.4ghz ,",
    "the flux densities are @xmath36mjy and @xmath37mjy , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of far - infrared to radio flux densities for ngc  4853 is comparable ( but at the high end of the distribution ) of that seen from the infrared to radio correlation ( for the iras galaxies of @xcite ) , and our predicted ratio for d100 coincides with the mean of the distribution .",
    "thus , d100 and ngc  4853 have infrared to radio flux density ratios that are typical of normal galaxies and not particularly low as found for some spiral galaxies in rich clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the far infrared luminosities for the coma cluster galaxies as @xmath38 at @xmath39 m assuming a flux density ratio of @xmath35 ( consistent with observations of ngc  4853 ) .",
    "the resulting luminosity , @xmath40 , is approximately equal to the parameter @xmath41 of @xcite based on the 60 and 100@xmath0 m flux densities for a galaxy with a typical ratio @xmath42 .",
    "infrared luminosities ( table 1 ) have only been estimated for galaxies with enhanced 12@xmath0 m emission compared to their @xmath28 m flux densities .",
    "most of the galaxies have low infrared to optical flux density ratios and moderate far infrared luminosities .",
    "the infrared to optical flux density ratios are similar to those of optically selected galaxies , which have log@xmath43 for shapely - ames galaxies ( @xcite , where @xmath44 is computed as @xmath38 at b band ) .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between this ratio and the infrared flux density ( as observed in the iras bright galaxy sample ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of correlation may result from our small sample and the decaying star formation rates in most of these galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we compare star formation rates estimated from elevated 12@xmath0 m emission to those estimated from h@xmath2 emission and a previous epoch inferred from the presence of balmer absorption lines .",
    "we first consider the more quiescent galaxies . from optical absorption lines",
    ", @xcite estimated that d94 , d99 and d112 have @xmath45 of their light at @xmath46 from a starburst population @xmath47 gyr old . assuming a saltpeter imf , a few times @xmath48 stars were formed during this episode of star formation ( e.g. , using mass - to - light ratios given in @xcite ) .",
    "these values correspond very approximately to star formation at a rate of @xmath1 5 m@xmath49/yr averaged over a gyr .",
    "the absence of observed line emission restricts the current star formation rates to less than @xmath50/yr ( using a conversion from @xcite ) .",
    "however , the lack of 12@xmath0 m emission , corresponding to @xmath51 ( using conversion factors discussed in @xcite and @xcite ) , limits the current star formation rate even more , @xmath52/yr .",
    "ngc  4853 has a star formation rate ( estimated from the h@xmath2 flux ) of @xmath53/yr ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with the far - infrared luminosity of @xmath54 estimated from the @xmath29 m emission . @xcite and @xcite estimated an age of @xmath55 gyr for a population contributing @xmath45 of the light at @xmath46 , which implies that @xmath56 stars were formed during this burst , i.e. , a rate of @xmath57/yr or higher averaged over a gyr .",
    "thus , the current star formation rates in ngc  4853 , d94 , d99 and d112 are well below those required to form the @xmath8 gyr old burst populations responsible for their balmer absorption features .",
    "d44 , on the other hand , has an e+a spectrum as well as emission lines characteristic of an agn .",
    "the galaxy is too faint at 12@xmath0 m to determine if the emission is resolved .",
    "d44 has absorption lines similar to those of ngc  4853 suggesting that a population of a few times @xmath48 was formed about a gyr ago",
    ". however its h@xmath2 emission ( which is primarily due to an agn ) restricts its star formation rate to less than @xmath58/yr .",
    "the 12@xmath0 m emission level restricts its current star formation to less than @xmath59/yr .",
    "this suggests that this galaxy is less active now than during the time when it formed its @xmath8 gyr old burst population responsible for its balmer absorption features .",
    "d100 has an emission line spectrum similar to hii regions , suggesting active ongoing star formation .",
    "the emission line fluxes correspond to a star formation rate of @xmath53/yr .",
    "the optical absorption lines indicate a @xmath1 @xmath60 gyr old population , contributing @xmath61 of the light at @xmath46 ( @xcite ) similar to the other galaxies and containing a few times @xmath48 stars .",
    "the far infrared flux density predicted from the 12@xmath0 m emission ( as described above ) is a factor of a few lower than predicted from the h@xmath2 luminosity but within the scatter observed by @xcite for the correlation of h@xmath2 to infrared luminosities . the higher current star - formation rate and younger post - star burst population in d100 suggest the current star formation rate is similar to that required to form its @xmath60 gyr old burst population .",
    "d45 has optical absorption spectral features similar to those of d94 , d99 , and d112 ( @xcite ) and so probably has a similar young population of a few times @xmath48 and of age @xmath62 gyr old .",
    "however this galaxy is irregular , very blue in optical and near - infrared colors ( b - k @xmath63 ) and has h@xmath2 emission flux consistent with a star formation rate of @xmath64/yr ( @xcite ) which roughly corresponds to the far infrared flux density predicted from its 12@xmath0 m flux density . as in the case of d100",
    ", the star formation rate of d45 is not necessarily significantly below that required to form its 1 gyr old burst population .",
    "we observe that the 12@xmath0 m emission in d16 , which contains an agn , is extended and so the galaxy is probably also forming stars .",
    "at least @xmath61 of the 12@xmath0 m flux density is resolved in the image .",
    "assuming that @xmath61 of the 12@xmath0 m flux density is due to star formation regions we estimate a star formation rate of @xmath59/yr .",
    "since d16 does not display balmer absorption features its activity is probably recent .",
    "based on these individual star formation histories we can divide our sample galaxies into two groups : 1 ) those that have current star formation rates that are substantially lower than that required to form their @xmath8 gyr old populations ( ngc  4853 , d94 , d99 , d112 , and d44 ) and 2 ) those with significant ongoing star formation ( d100 , d45 ) or / and agn activity ( d16 ) compared to that occurring @xmath8 gyr ago .",
    "we note no difference in the distribution on the sky between these two groups .",
    "in fact , d99 and d100 are within the same isocam imaging field and near the cluster center .",
    "however we do notice a difference these two groups when we consider their systemic velocities .",
    "the galaxies with ongoing activity have systemic velocities below the cluster mean velocity , @xmath65 km / s ( @xcite ) , and the galaxies from the more quiescent first group have velocities above this mean ( see table 1 ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines have a mean velocity about 200 km / s above the cluster mean velocity .",
    "late type galaxies , on the other hand , have a much higher velocity dispersion than the early type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our first group of galaxies is kinematically consistent with the the e+a galaxies of @xcite , whereas our second group of galaxies would be consistent with the kinematic properties of the late - type galaxies .",
    "this would be consistent with the interpretation of @xcite that the e+a galaxies ( lacking significant ongoing activity ) , in the first group , are part of a complex which entered the cluster environment @xmath8 gyr ago .",
    "galaxies in the second group , with ongoing and more recent activity , are likely to have entered the cluster as part of different complexes and at later times .",
    "the kinematic differences between the two groups suggest that star formation triggered by the cluster decays on a timescale of order a gyr ( consistent with simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "recent surveys conducted in the region of the coma cluster make it possible to place constraints on the far infrared luminosity function of galaxies in the cluster and so better compute the integrated far infrared luminosity of the coma cluster .",
    "we consider three magnitude limited samples : iras , h@xmath2 and radio .    the total far infrared luminosity of of a nearby rich cluster such as the coma cluster can be estimated from the total number of galaxies that are detected at a particular limiting luminosity and integrating the far - infrared luminosity function ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . to apply this method",
    ", we need to constrain the slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function . @xcite",
    "adopted a luminosity function in the form of two power laws and a slope at the low luminosity end of @xmath66 .",
    "they derived a total integrated flux density at @xmath67 of 2250 mjy at @xmath39 m for a typical rich cluster .",
    "however , more recent studies have suggested that the field galaxy luminosity function has a low end slope near @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical luminosity function in rich clusters has a slope of about @xmath69 at its low end ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it therefore appears likely that the value adopted by kelly and rieke is too steep .",
    "slopes of either @xmath68 or @xmath69 would yield an average @xmath39 m flux density for a rich cluster at @xmath67 of @xmath70 mjy , calculated by correcting the entry of 2250 mjy in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we can test this value by integrating the luminosity function and comparing the result to measurements of the observed ( by iras ) total far - infrared emission of nearby rich clusters .",
    "@xcite estimated a 100@xmath0 m emission of @xmath71 mjy for six clusters at a similar average redshift of @xmath67 but through a @xmath72 diameter aperture .",
    "this measurement corresponds to a 60@xmath0 m flux density of @xmath73 mjy ( assuming the far infrared colors typical of a normal galaxy ) . in the study of @xcite",
    "the 27 clusters of richness class 1 or greater ( with an average of @xmath74 ) have an average @xmath39 m flux density of @xmath75 mjy in a @xmath72 diameter beam . to compare directly with the luminosity function based estimates from the @xcite work",
    ", we would need measurements in a larger beam , @xmath1 @xmath76 .",
    "however , it is impossible to obtain iras measurements with larger beams because noise caused by confusion with the infrared cirrus increases with diameter more rapidly than does the signal from the galaxy cluster .",
    "nonetheless , it is difficult to reconcile the @xmath77 mjy predicted in a 30 aperture by @xcite assuming a low end slope of -0.8 with the @xmath78 mjy measured by @xcite and @xcite in a 10 aperture .",
    "for example , if such a steep aperture dependence held , the clusters would be more readily detectable in a @xmath76 beam by @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite show the coma cluster is centrally concentrated in the radio source counts .",
    "finally , @xcite find the 60@xmath0 m flux density of rich clusters at @xmath79 to be approximately point - like in the @xmath1 @xmath80 effective iras addscan beam .",
    "therefore , the data of @xcite and @xcite appear to be in better agreement with the corrected flux densities of @xmath1 800 mjy for low end slopes of @xmath68 or @xmath69 than with that of @xmath66 in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we adopt a slope in this former range .",
    "@xcite identify 5 galaxies detected with iras within 3 mpc ( 2 degrees ) of the coma cluster center with @xmath81 .",
    "normalizing the cluster luminosity function to these five galaxies and using eqns .  4 and 5 from @xcite to integrate it",
    ", we estimate that the total cluster luminosity is @xmath82 .    since we expect a correlation between the h@xmath2 emission and far infrared luminosity we can compare the above total luminosity to that predicted from the cluster galaxies with measured h@xmath2 luminosities . @xcite measured h@xmath2 luminosities for a sample of late - type galaxies with photographic magnitudes brighter than @xmath83 .",
    "the 13 late - type galaxies within a degree of the cluster center observed by them have h@xmath2 luminosities of @xmath84 erg / s corresponding to star formation rates of @xmath85/yr and far infrared luminosities of @xmath86 . assuming this luminosity as a limiting far infrared magnitude and a total of 13 late - type galaxies we derive a total cluster luminosity of @xmath87 , similar to but somewhat lower than that estimated from the iras identifications .",
    "this sample should give only a lower limit to the total cluster luminosity because it only covers late type galaxies with @xmath88 and consists only of optically bright spirals and so may be missing optically faint but star forming late - type galaxies ( such as d45 ) as well as earlier - type galaxies . some , but not all , of the iras detected galaxies of @xcite are detected with bright h@xmath2 emission by @xcite , emphasizing that the h@xmath2 data give a lower limit to the infrared luminosity .",
    "the deep vla study of @xcite is complete to a level of 1.2mjy at 1.4ghz and covers a square degree centered on the center of the coma cluster .",
    "they estimate that there are @xmath89 galaxies with flux densities above 3mjy in excess of the expected background radio source counts . at this level",
    "the radio source counts should be dominated by s0 and later type galaxies undergoing star formation rather than radio elliptical galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . assuming a typical far infrared to radio flux density ratio of 1/120 ( @xcite ) the flux density limit of 3mjy at 1.4ghz corresponds to a limiting luminosity of @xmath90 .",
    "if we assume that 36 galaxies are in the cluster with luminosities above this level , then the total luminosity of the cluster would be @xmath91 .",
    "this value should be taken as an upper limit for a number of reasons .",
    "for example , 50% of the possible radio detections are not optically identified and so have @xmath92 ; their nature requires further investigation .",
    "a fraction of the radio luminous galaxies are radio ellipticals and so should not have been included in this tally because their radio emission may be dominated by sources not associated with recent star formation .",
    "also the derived total cluster luminosity may be an upper limit if the average fir / radio ratio is lower than normal for galaxies in dense clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "in extrapolating to low luminosities , we have assumed that there is no unique infrared emitting population that would cause the luminosity function to differ from that in the field . to test this assumption",
    ", we compare our estimates for the total cluster luminosity to that which could be contributed from early type galaxies such as the e+a ones studied here .",
    "our target galaxies were drawn from the @xcite and @xcite survey of 182 early - type coma cluster galaxies out of which 18 had balmer absorption , 3 had agn - like characteristics and 2 had emission lines typical of recent star formation .",
    "20 galaxies total had abnormal spectral features since some had both types of features .",
    "the sample was drawn from the complete ( to b=20 ) sample of @xcite of @xmath70 galaxies and was color and morphology selected to include all early - type ( e and s0 ) galaxies .",
    "our sample of early - type galaxies with weak on - going star formation has a limiting flux density @xmath8 mjy at 12@xmath0 m . using a typical ratio of @xmath93",
    "this flux density corresponds to a limiting luminosity at @xmath39 m of @xmath94 .",
    "we can assume the galaxies ( 6/8 ) detected at 12@xmath0 m with abnormal spectral features would have far infrared flux densities greater than this limit .",
    "we then estimate that 15 galaxies would been found to have flux densities greater than this limit if we could have surveyed the entire list of 20 galaxies with abnormal spectral features .",
    "if we assume that this 20 represents all the relatively luminous early - type galaxies in the coma cluster with abnormal spectral features , then there would be 15 galaxies total with @xmath95 .",
    "using eqns 4 and 5 of @xcite but with a luminosity function with a slope at the faint end ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath69 we derive a total luminosity of @xmath96 for these galaxies , only a fraction of that predicted above for the full cluster .",
    "we conclude that early - type galaxies with weak ongoing star formation are probably not major contributors to the total far infrared cluster luminosity .",
    "typical nearby rich clusters contain less than 4% of blue late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the fraction of late - type galaxies in coma is estimated to be 14% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sw field contains most of the galaxies with abnormal spectral features and is coincident with a peak in x - ray emission ( and radio source counts ; @xcite ) suggesting that a merger of subclusters has taken place ( @xcite ) .",
    "since galaxies associated with this merger probably make a significant contribution to the total cluster far infrared flux density , the coma cluster luminosity should be higher than that of a typical rich nearby cluster .",
    "@xcite modeled the distribution of dust that might be responsible for the reported extinction through the coma cluster and found that the cluster would emit at @xmath97 m a flux density of 0.2 mjy / sr , due to heating of this intergalactic dust by the hot cluster gas .",
    "@xcite have reported detection of a surface brightness of 0.1 mjy / sr at 120@xmath0 m , which they take to confirm this prediction .",
    "the technique used by stickel et al .  is based on a small ( 3% ) change in the ratio of 120@xmath0 m to 185@xmath0 m flux densities .",
    "their data are not extensive enough to assess the variations in this ratio from galactic infrared cirrus alone , which constitute the `` noise '' in their technique . in fact",
    ", their scan at pa 36@xmath98 appears to be too noisy for an independent detection of the cluster .",
    "thus , the reality of their detection is difficult to assess on simple signal to noise considerations .",
    "moreover , in this paper we have found that the cluster galaxies themselves are likely to be a significant source of far infrared emission .",
    "it is noteworthy that we find roughly consistent estimates of the 60 @xmath0 m cluster luminosity in galaxies through three independent estimates : from the h@xmath2 emission , we find a lower limit of @xmath99 ; from the radio emission of individual galaxies , we find an upper limit of @xmath100 ; and finally , directly from the infrared measurements of cluster galaxies , we deduce a luminosity of @xmath101 . assuming a luminosity of @xmath101 in the central square degree of the cluster , and that the far infrared flux density ratios are as in ngc  4853 , we estimate a surface brightness of 0.06 mjy / sr at 100@xmath0 m , which is similar to the excess source measured by @xcite . thus ,",
    "if the far infrared spectra of the coma cluster galaxies are slightly hotter in 120/185 @xmath0 m color than is the galactic infrared cirrus , these galaxies could also be the cause of the apparent detection by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the surface brightness due to heating of the intergalactic dust is not convincingly detected and may be substantially lower than predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected five of 56 clusters in the iras far infrared data . in two cases ,",
    "the emission was possibly extended and they concluded it might arise in the intracluster medium .",
    "in other cases , the detected flux density could be attributed to individual galaxies . @xcite",
    "measured a modest level of extinction in cooling flow clusters and argued that a far infrared emission of @xmath102 jy at 100@xmath0 m was expected due to heating of the intergalactic dust responsible for this extinction .",
    "she found an average flux density of 0.3 jy from the iras data , in agreement with this prediction .    in both these cases",
    ", we have shown that the far infrared emission of the clusters is in reasonably good agreement with the flux densities that @xcite found for similar clusters , if we update their result with an improved galaxy luminosity function .",
    "because the flux densitiess of @xcite were obtained by summing the output of individual galaxies , this agreement suggests , as we found for coma , that much of the far infrared emission of these clusters arises from their member galaxies and not from the intergalactic dust .",
    "we now compare the typical 60@xmath0 m cluster flux density of 800 mjy at @xmath67 , ( corrected from @xcite ) to the measurement of @xcite of an average flux density of 28 mjy at @xmath3 for the distant cluster sample . at 60@xmath0 m",
    "the k correction between these two redshifts is about a factor of @xmath103 ( @xcite ) , so the predicted 60@xmath0 m flux density at @xmath3 would be 7.5mjy assuming no luminosity evolution . by comparing the measurements at the two redshifts we find a nominal luminosity evolution that is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "the uncertainties in this estimate remain large because of the problems in estimating the far infrared luminosity of the nearby clusters .",
    "@xcite find a far infrared density evolution for field galaxies in the iras data of @xmath105 , which is equivalent to a luminosity evolution of about @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if the far infrared emission from rich clusters arises primarily from their member galaxies , as we argue in the previous section , then we infer that the luminosity evolution of these galaxies is similar to , or perhaps somewhat stronger than , the evolution of field galaxies .",
    "we have presented broad band 12@xmath0 m images of 9 coma cluster galaxies , 8 of which show either e+a characteristics or / and narrow emission lines .",
    "we have detected 7 galaxies , 5 with narrow emission lines ( including 2 agns ) , one bright control galaxy lacking abnormal spectral characteristics , and one pure e+a galaxy lacking narrow emission lines but detected at the low flux density of 0.4 mjy .",
    "the remaining two e+a galaxies ( lacking narrow emission lines ) were not detected with an upper limit of 0.3 mjy .",
    "we use these data and information from the literature to conclude :    1 . ) only galaxies with emission lines have significantly enhanced 12@xmath0 m flux densities compared to their 2.2 micron flux densities .",
    "the e+a phase ( lacking emission lines ) appears to be truly a post starburst phase with little on - going star formation . 2 .",
    ") the one galaxy in our sample also detected by iras , ngc  4853 , has similar mid and far - infrared colors similar to those of a normal spiral galaxy .",
    "this behavior lets us estimate far infrared outputs for galaxies with enhanced 12@xmath0 m flux densities .",
    "\\3 ) by comparing the current star formation rates with previous rates estimated from the balmer absorption features we divide the galaxies into two groups : those having current star formation rates that are substantially lower than that required to form their @xmath8 gyr old populations ( ngc  4853 , d94 , d99 , d44 and d112 ) and those with significant ongoing star formation or / and agn activity ( d45 , d100 , and d16 ) .",
    "we note no strong difference in the spatial distribution on the sky between these two groups , however they have distinct ranges for their systemic velocities .",
    "the first group has velocities above the mean cluster velocity and the second group has velocities well below it .",
    "this would be consistent with the interpretation of @xcite that the different populations in the coma cluster originate from distinct cluster infall events .",
    "the kinematic differences between the two groups suggests that star formation triggered by the cluster decays on a timescale of order a gyr .    4 . ) using the iras identifications in the coma cluster ( @xcite ) , the h@xmath2 survey of late - type galaxies by @xcite and the radio survey of @xcite , and summing the indicated the far infrared luminosity function , we estimate that the total far infrared luminosity of the coma cluster is @xmath107 .    5 .",
    ") the early - type galaxies with abnormal spectral features ( balmer absorption or narrow line emission ) contribute only a small fraction of the total luminosity .",
    "late type galaxies , such as those that tend to be infrared bright in the field , dominate the coma cluster galaxian luminosity .",
    "their integrated luminosity is a substantial portion , probably the majority , of the far infrared luminosity of the cluster .",
    "the far infrared emission of the coma cluster intergalactic medium is not yet reliably detected .",
    "a complication in measuring this emission in large beam observations that do not resolve the individual galaxies is the potentially dominant role of the galaxies in the integrated cluster far infrared emission .    7 . )",
    "previous indications of very little far infrared cosmic luminosity evolution in rich clusters probably are incorrect because of an overestimate of the average luminosity of nearby clusters . using an updated galaxy luminosity function",
    ", we find that the cluster evolution is as fast as , or perhaps even faster than , that of field galaxies .",
