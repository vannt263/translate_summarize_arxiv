    "in this paper , we investigate the independent and identically - distributed ( i.i.d . ) random dynamics of rational maps on the riemann sphere @xmath0 and the dynamics of rational semigroups ( i.e. , semigroups of non - constant rational maps where the semigroup operation is functional composition ) on @xmath3    one motivation for research in complex dynamical systems is to describe some mathematical models on ethology .",
    "for example , the behavior of the population of a certain species can be described by the dynamical system associated with iteration of a polynomial @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , when there is a change in the natural environment , some species have several strategies to survive in nature . from this point of view",
    ", it is very natural and important not only to consider the dynamics of iteration , where the same survival strategy ( i.e. , function ) is repeatedly applied , but also to consider random dynamics , where a new strategy might be applied at each time step .",
    "another motivation for research in complex dynamics is newton s method to find a root of a complex polynomial , which often is expressed as the dynamics of a rational map @xmath5 on @xmath0 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the degree of @xmath8 we sometimes use computers to analyze such dynamics , and since we have some errors at each step of the calculation in the computers , it is quite natural to investigate the random dynamics of rational maps . in various fields",
    ", we have many mathematical models which are described by the dynamical systems associated with polynomial or rational maps . for each model , it is natural and important to consider a randomized model , since we always have some kind of noise or random terms in nature .",
    "the first study of random complex dynamics was given by j. e. fornaess and n. sibony ( @xcite ) .",
    "they mainly investigated random dynamics generated by small perturbations of a single rational map . for research on random complex dynamics of quadratic polynomials ,",
    "see @xcite . for research on random dynamics of polynomials ( of general degrees ) ,",
    "see the author s works @xcite .    in order to investigate random complex dynamics , it is very natural to study the dynamics of associated rational semigroups .",
    "in fact , it is a very powerful tool to investigate random complex dynamics , since random complex dynamics and the dynamics of rational semigroups are related to each other very deeply . the first study of dynamics of rational semigroups was conducted by a. hinkkanen and g. j. martin ( @xcite ) , who were interested in the role of the dynamics of polynomial semigroups ( i.e. , semigroups of non - constant polynomial maps ) while studying various one - complex - dimensional moduli spaces for discrete groups , and by f. ren s group ( @xcite ) , who studied such semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems . since the julia set @xmath9 of a finitely generated rational semigroup @xmath10",
    "has `` backward self - similarity , '' i.e. , @xmath11 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 0.2 ) ) , the study of the dynamics of rational semigroups can be regarded as the study of `` backward iterated function systems , '' and also as a generalization of the study of self - similar sets in fractal geometry . for recent work on the dynamics of rational semigroups , see the author s papers @xcite@xcite , and @xcite .    in this paper , by combining several results from @xcite and many new ideas , we investigate the random complex dynamics and the dynamics of rational semigroups . in the usual iteration dynamics of a single rational map @xmath5 with @xmath6 , we always have a non - empty chaotic part , i.e. , in the julia set @xmath12 of @xmath5 , which is a perfect set , we have sensitive initial values and dense orbits .",
    "moreover , for any ball @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 expands as @xmath16 regarding random complex dynamics , it is natural to ask the following question .",
    "do we have a kind of `` chaos '' in the averaged system ? or do we have no chaos",
    "? how do many kinds of maps in the system interact ?",
    "what can we say about stability and bifurcation ?",
    "since the chaotic phenomena hold even for a single rational map , one may expect that in random dynamics of rational maps , most systems would exhibit a great amount of chaos .",
    "however , it turns out that this is not true .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to prove that for a generic system of random complex dynamics of polynomials , many kinds of maps in the system `` automatically '' cooperate so that they make the chaos of the averaged system disappear at any point in the phase space , even though the dynamics of each map in the system have a chaotic part .",
    "we call this phenomenon the `` * cooperation principle * '' . moreover , we prove that for a generic system , we have a kind of stability ( see theorems  [ t : msmtaustint ] , [ t : msmtaust ] ) .",
    "we remark that the chaos disappears in the @xmath17 `` sense '' , but under certain conditions , the chaos remains in the @xmath18 `` sense '' , where @xmath18 denotes the space of @xmath19-hlder continuous functions with exponent @xmath20 ( see remark  [ r : holb ] ) .    to introduce the main idea of this paper , we let @xmath21 be a rational semigroup and denote by @xmath22 the fatou set of @xmath21 , which is defined to be the maximal open subset of @xmath0 where @xmath21 is equicontinuous with respect to the spherical distance on @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath23 the julia set of @xmath24 the julia set is backward invariant under each element @xmath25 , but might not be forward invariant .",
    "this is a difficulty of the theory of rational semigroups .",
    "nevertheless , we utilize this as follows .",
    "the key to investigating random complex dynamics is to consider the following * kernel julia set * of @xmath21 , which is defined by @xmath26 this is the largest forward invariant subset of @xmath9 under the action of @xmath24 note that if @xmath21 is a group or if @xmath21 is a commutative semigroup , then @xmath27 however , for a general rational semigroup @xmath21 generated by a family of rational maps @xmath28 with @xmath29 , it may happen that @xmath30 .",
