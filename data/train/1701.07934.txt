    "it is well known that in the evolution of the early universe , it presented a rapid but finite period of the expansion called inflationary period or simply inflation @xcite . in this context",
    ", inflation gives an elegant proposal for solving some problems of the standard model of the universe ; the flatness , horizon , monopoles , among other .",
    "nevertheless , an important feature of the inflationary epoch is that inflation gives account of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite , as well as gives a causal explanation of the source of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite .    among the different models that give account of the dynamical evolution of the inflation",
    ", we can mention the model of warm inflation . in the stage of warm inflation the early universe is filled with a self - interacting scalar field ( inflaton ) and the radiation . in this sense , the model of warm inflation",
    "has the special feature that it omits the reheating stage at the end of inflation , since this model introduces a decay of a scalar field into radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , the scenario of warm inflation differs from the standard inflation or the cold inflation . in this form , during the stage of warm inflation the decay takes place from the dissipative effects , and are caused from a friction term introduced on the background equations .",
    "another important characteristic of warm inflation are the thermal fluctuations produced from the inflationary epoch .",
    "these thermal fluctuations play an important role in the initial thermal fluctuations essential for the seeds of the lss formation @xcite .",
    "as warm inflation incorporates in its evolution a radiation field with temperature @xmath5 , and the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the scalar field are directly proportional to the hubble parameter @xmath6 and the temperature , and considering that during warm inflation the thermal fluctuations of the scalar field predominates over the quantum fluctuations , then the condition @xmath3 could be satisfied , see refs.@xcite .",
    "also , we mention that warm inflation ends when the universe stops inflating and smoothly goes into the radiation era of the standard big - bang model . for a review of models of warm inflation model ,",
    "see ref.@xcite , and for a representative list of recent references , see refs.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one general class of inflationary models in which the expansion of the universe is driven by a minimally coupled scalar field are the galilean models of inflation or g - inflation .",
    "the model of the g - inflation includes the canonical and non - canonical scalar field models of inflation , and in the literature are known as kinetic gravity braiding models@xcite .",
    "however , we can mention that the most general class of inflationary model corresponds to a generalized g - inflation or g@xmath7-inflation that was studied in ref.@xcite , here the authors shown the equivalence with the horndeski theory@xcite .",
    "the importance of these models is that the field equations still include derivatives only up to second order@xcite .",
    "the action of the g - model incorporate an additional term of the form @xmath8 to the standard action of the non canonical scalar field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model of g - inflation is an intriguing type of inflationary universe , since it has a blue spectrum of the primordial tensor modes which violates the null energy condition stability@xcite .",
    "however , considering the slow - roll approximation together with some effective potentials , these models can not generate a blue tensor spectrum@xcite .",
    "for example , in the model of higgs g - inflation that corresponds to a modification of the standard higgs inflation , in which @xmath9 , this situation does not occur @xcite .",
    "similarly , in ref.@xcite was studied the case of the graceful exist from higgs g - inflation and also the blue spectrum is prohibited , see also ref.@xcite for the generalized higgs g - inflation . in particular for the case",
    "in which the potential is exactly flat was studied in g - inflation , this model was called ultra slow roll g - inflation @xcite , and here the blue tensor perturbation and the null energy condition are prohibited . the same way , an effective potential of the form power law can be found in ref.@xcite , and depending of the parameters - space the consistency relation could be violated .",
    "recently , the reheating and the particle production at the end of inflation in g - inflation was studied in ref.@xcite , see also@xcite , and the difference from string gas cosmology in ref.@xcite .",
    "also , in the context of the dark energy these g - models was studied e.g. in refs.@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the model of the warm inflation in the context of the galilean model or g - model , and how a dissipative coefficient @xmath10 coming from an interaction between a standard scalar field and a radiation field influences the standard g - cold model . under a general formalism",
    ", we will find the dynamics and the cosmological perturbations ; scalar perturbation and tensor perturbation in which the function @xmath11 is given by @xmath0 . in order to consider the model of g - warm inflation at the background level",
    ", we will analyze the modified motion of equations assuming the slow roll approximation .",
    "also , from the langevin equation in this framework , we will obtain an analytical expression of the power spectrum and its spectral index . as a concrete example and in order to obtain analytical quantities , we consider an exponential potential , together with a dissipative coefficient and galileon parameter constants . here , we will consider a g - warm inflation for two regimes , namely the weak and strong regimes , where the standard weak and the strong dissipative stages together with the galileon effect are analyzed . in both stages , we will obtain constraints on the different parameters of our g - warm model , considering the condition for warm inflation in which @xmath3 , the condition for the weak regime in which @xmath1 ( or the strong regime where @xmath2 ) , together with the @xmath12 plane from planck data @xcite .",
