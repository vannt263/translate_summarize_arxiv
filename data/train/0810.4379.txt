    "the newly discovered phenomenon , the _ spectral softening _ of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by the swift instruments in their early x - ray afterglows [ 1@xmath25 ] has not been predicted by any of the existing grb models .",
    "credit of this discovery goes to the swift instruments , which can monitor x - ray emission of grbs at quite early time after the trigger events .",
    "soon after this discovery , authors of ref . [ 6 ] performed a systematic analysis on a selected sample of swift bursts and found that @xmath3 of the bursts ( 33 out of 44 ) show an obvious spectral softening process .",
    "besides their papers , the unlv ( university of nevada , las vegas ) grb group also presented the temporal and spectral data of swift bursts on their web - site , which are continued to be accumulated as the number of swift bursts keeps increasing .",
    "their data show , besides the steep decay phase , the softening can be observed in later phases as well ( see our analysis below ) .",
    "most softening processes are detected in the steep decay phase in the early x - ray afterglows of grbs .",
    "since the steep decay phase promptly follows , and is smoothly connected to , the prompt emission phase , it is regarded as the prompt emission tail [ 7@xmath210 ] .",
    "it is generally believed that this phenomenon is due to the high latitude emission of fireballs , in which the so - called curvature effect must play a role [ 6 , 9 , 11@xmath218 ] . however , the steep decay tails are expected from the curvature effect but the softening process is not , which puzzled astronomers .",
    "the curvature effect arises from the emission from the surface of an relativistically expanding fireball , where the delay of time , the shifting of the intrinsic spectrum due to high latitude emission areas , as well as other relevant factors of expanding fireballs must be taken into account ( for detail explanation and analysis , see [ 17 , 19@xmath221 ] ) .",
    "due to the great amount of energy release , relativistically expanding fireballs would be produced at very early epoch of grbs [ 22 , 23 ] .",
    "the curvature effect is thus expected in the prompt gamma - ray emission phase .",
    "investigations on the profile of the light curves of pulses , the spectral lags , the power - law relation between the pulse width and the energy , the evolution of the hardness ratio and the evolution of the peak energy in the prompt emission phase have been performed by various groups in the last decade [ 19@xmath221 , 24@xmath234 ] .",
    "it was shown that the effect can also play an important role in the early afterglow period [ 11 , 12 , 17 , 35 ] .",
    "there are only few attempts of interpreting the softening phenomenon which indicate that the phenomenon is beyond the expectation of current or underlying models .",
    "the few attempts of interpretation include : cooling of the internal - shocked region might be responsible for strong softening [ 6 ] ; at least in some bursts , the softening might be accounted for by the central engine , which is assumed to produce a soft and decaying afterglow emission [ 1 , 6 , 36 ] ; both the temporal behavior and the spectral softening of bursts might be a consequence of the cannonball model of grbs [ 37 ] ; a hard - to - soft behavior lasting to the latest phases of the afterglow can be expected base on the `` fireshell '' model with a `` canonical grb '' light curve containing two sharply different components [ 38 , 39 ] .",
    "one of the most remarkable investigation on this issue is performed by authors of ref . [ 16 ] .",
    "they concluded that the early emission in @xmath4 of early afterglows has a curved @xmath5 spectrum and that @xmath6 ( peak energy ) likely evolves from the @xmath7-rays through the soft x - ray bands on the timescales of @xmath8 s after the grbs .",
    "along with this is the discovery of ref .",
    "[ 5 ] : the @xmath6 of grb 060614 , which is one of the members of ref . [ 6 ] s sample , decreases to as low as @xmath9 8 kev at the beginning of the xrt observations .",
    "the same phenomenon was revealed in literature as early as in 2000 by the analysis of bepposax data : the peak energy was found to evolve from the prompt to the afterglow phase of grbs , decreasing from @xmath10 to @xmath11 for some bursts [ 40 ] .",
    "motivated by ref .",
    "[ 16 ] s finding , very recently , the author of [ 35 ] has shown that the curvature effect alone can produce both the softening and the decaying behavior observed in the early x - ray afterglow of the swift bursts .",
    "it is due the shifting of the band function spectrum [ 41 ] which gives rise to the softening along with the temporal decaying .",
    "two factors of the curvature effect , the time delay and the variation of the doppler effect of higher latitude emission from the fireball surface , cause the shifting of the band function spectrum .    according to the curvature effect scenario , the start time of the softening is much smaller than the terminating time of the process , and then it is expected that the softening duration must be correlated with its terminating time [ 35 ] .",
    "we will investigate statistically in the following if the two quantities are correlated or not . at the same time",
    ", some other statistical properties will also be explored .",
    "we will not limit our analysis on the steep decay phase , but instead , any softening detected in the xrt light curve will be considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe our sample of swift data and the data reduction ; in section 3 , we discuss the statistical properties obtained from our analysis ; conclusions of the present work are reported in the last section .",
    "the data ( up to may 23 , 2008 ) employed in our analysis on the relation between the duration and terminating time of the softening process are taken from the unlv grb group web - site ( see footnote 1 ) , where swift / xrt time - resolved spectra of selected bursts are available ( see ref . [ 6 ] for selection criteria of the bursts ) . the softening is observed in some of the bursts and we selected only those bursts which have noticeable x - ray softening , i.e. , those bursts which should contain at least three data points starting from a smaller spectral index and ending at a larger one ( refer to the time intervals presented in table 1 and the corresponding spectral evolution figures presented in the unlv grb group web - site ) .    the start time ( @xmath12 ) and the terminating time ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "together with the corresponding values of the spectral index ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , of the softening process of the selected bursts are listed in table 1 . here",
    "we divide the softening process into two distinct classes according to the corresponding terminating time : for class 1 , @xmath16 ( called the early type softening ) ; and for class 2 , @xmath1 ( called the late type softening ) .",
    "note that , for some bursts , there might exist both types of softening ( see table 1 ) .     and",
    "@xmath13 , and those in the upper panel represent that of @xmath17 and @xmath18.,width=480 ]    an examples of selecting the softening as well as the corresponding start time and terminating time is displayed in the lower panel of fig . 1 ( note that we employ index @xmath19 instead @xmath20 ) , where the spectral evolution of grb 070520b is shown .",
    "the light curve of this burst is displayed in the upper panel of the figure .",
    "the spectral and light curve data are taken from http://swift.physics.unlv.edu/ ( spectra.txt and lc.txt files ) .",
    "we first selected @xmath12 and @xmath13 by viewing the @xmath19 vs. @xmath21 plot ( see the lower panel of fig . 1 and the dash lines there ) , and then located them in the spectra.txt file of the burst , and then read and calculated ( see the explanation below ) their values as well as their uncertainties from this file .",
    "the provided data have been analyzed by the unlv grb group .",
    "the details of the analysis are described in ref .",
    "the unlv grb group have developed a time filter for the time - resolved spectral analysis which can be automatically performed .",
    "time intervals for analyzing the spectral index are determined by two criteria raised by them , and hence they are different from each other .",
    "for example , for grb 070520b , the lower limit of the time interval associated with its @xmath22 is @xmath23 and the upper limit of this interval is @xmath24 ( see fig . 1 and table 1 , and also the spectra.txt file ) .",
    "this gives rise to a time interval of @xmath25 . according to the data format file , the mean time of this interval is @xmath26 and its error is @xmath27 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , the lower limit of the time interval associated with @xmath28 of this burst is @xmath29 , and the upper limit of this interval is @xmath30 . that measures the time interval as @xmath31 .",
    "the mean time of this interval is @xmath32 and its error is @xmath33 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the unlv grb group use different nh for different sources .",
    "they used the xspec spectral fitting model : a simple power law combined with the absorptions of both our galaxy and the grb host galaxy , wabs@xmath34 zwabs@xmath35 power law ( for bursts with known redshifts ) or wabs@xmath34 wabs@xmath35 power law ( for bursts whose redshifts are unknown ) ( see ref .",
    "and the terminating time @xmath13 of the softening process observed in the x - ray afterglows of the selected bursts .",
    "the upper and lower solid lines are drawn by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "open circles and open circles with dots represent the early type softening and the late type softening , respectively.,width=480 ]    the duration of the softening is calculated by @xmath38 . the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath13 for these bursts is displayed in fig .",
    "2 . we find that the data of ( @xmath13 , @xmath39 ) for the selected bursts are distributed mainly within the area confined by the lines represented by @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",
    "we observed a difference between the two types of softening : the ( @xmath13 , @xmath39 ) data for the late type softening are well within the mentioned area , while some of the data for the early type softening dropped out the mentioned area ( especially when @xmath13 is relatively smaller ) .",
    "we performed a spearman s correlation analysis and obtained : for the early type softening , log @xmath41 log @xmath42 , and the fitting parameters are @xmath43 ( the correlation coefficient ) , @xmath44 ( the number of data points ) , and @xmath45 ( the chance probability ) ; for the late type softening , log @xmath46 log @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "this is well in agreement with the prediction made by the curvature effect [ 35 ] .",
    "in addition , the results show that the correlation between the two quantities for the late type softening well follows the trend of the identical curve , while in some extent it betrays the identical curve for the early type softening ( see also fig .",
    "the cause of this difference is currently not known .",
    "in addition to the duration and terminating time of the softening process , we also measured the variations of the spectral index and the flux density during this period .",
    "the period of the softening is confined by the lower limit ( @xmath51 ) of the interval that measures @xmath14 and the upper limit ( @xmath52 ) of the interval that measures @xmath15 .",
    "for example , for grb 070520b , the lower limit of the time interval associated with its @xmath22 is @xmath23 , and the upper limit of the time interval associated with its @xmath28 is @xmath30 ( see the last section ) , and thus the softening period of this burst is the time interval from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . within this period",
    ", we search the minimum and maximum of the flux @xmath55 from the lc.txt file of grb 070520b .",
    "the two extreme values of the flux are denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , and the corresponding times are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and their uncertainties are estimated in the same way adopted in measuring @xmath12 and @xmath13 and their uncertainties ( see the last section ) . for grb 070520b",
    ", we found @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "one might observe that for this burst @xmath18 is different from @xmath12 and @xmath17 is different from @xmath13 .",
    "two facts cause this difference .",
    "the first is that time intervals for measuring the flux are generally smaller than those for measuring the spectral index ( see fig .",
    "1 , where the number of data points of the flux within the softening period is much larger than that of the spectral index ) .",
    "the second is that in the softening process some bursts undergo a rise phase and then a decay phase in its light curve , and close to the lower limit of the softening we measure the peak of the flux instead of the flux at the very beginning of the softening process ( see also fig .",
    "( note that we identified a softening process according to the spectral index but not the flux . )    in table 2 , we listed the maximum and minimum values of the flux density detected during the softening process .",
    "we calculated the variation rates of the two quantities by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the time interval between @xmath57 and @xmath56 , which can be different from @xmath39 ( see table 2 ) .     and",

    "solid lines from top to the bottom represent the @xmath66 lines with @xmath67 , 2 , 1 , and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the open circles represent the early type softening while the open circles with dots represent the late type softening.,width=480 ]    in fig .",
    "3 , we presented the relation between the two variation rates .",
    "it shows that the two types of softening do have distinct behaviors in the variation rate .",
    "data of the late type softening are distributed within the @xmath68 and @xmath69 curves , which well follow the trend of the identical curve . for the early type softening",
    ", the data are scattered in a wider area confined by the @xmath70 and @xmath71 curves .",
    "the trend of the early type is obviously deviated from that of the identical curve .",
    "a spearman s correlation analysis between the two variation rates was also performed . for the early type softening we got @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , @xmath44 , and @xmath74 , and for the late type softening we obtained @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , @xmath49 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the correlation must owe to the fact that the softening scope ( represented by @xmath78 ) and the decaying scale ( described by @xmath79 ) vary mildly for different sources , but the time interval of the process differ significantly .",
    "the two types of softening occupy distinct areas in the plot due to the large variance of the softening duration between them . but",
    "why the trends of the relation for the two types are so different remains unclear .",
    "in the present work , we studied the relation between the duration and terminating time of the softening process observed in the x - ray afterglows of the swift bursts .",
    "we found that these two quantities are obviously correlated , as expected by the curvature effect .",
    "the analysis reveals that the softening can be divided into two classes merely on the basis of the corresponding terminating time : the early type softening ( @xmath16 ) and the late type softening ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the two types of softening show different behaviors in their duration and the terminating time plot .",
    "we also investigated the relation between the variation rates of the flux density and the spectral index during the softening process . in this aspect",
    ", more obvious discrepancy is observed between the two types of softening .    as revealed in ref . [ 35 ] , the duration of the softening can be affected by three parameters : the lorentz factor , the radius , and the intrinsic radiative peak energy concerned . as shown in ref .",
    "[ 35 ] fig . 6 , for the same lorentz factor @xmath20 and radius @xmath80 , a smaller intrinsic peak energy @xmath81 can lead to a smaller duration of the process , while the corresponding terminating time will be unchanged . it would give rise to the betray observed in fig .",
    "why this occurs in the early type softening but not in the late type softening ?",
    "we suspect , probably the early type softening is of the internal shock origin while the late type softening is of the external shock origin . in the former case",
    "the lorentz factor is large and then the curvature effect is sensitive to the fireball parameters while in the latter case the lorentz factor is small and hence the curvature effect is less sensitive to the fireball parameters .",
    "is it due to the selection effect ?",
    "this is unlikely , because if the earlier softening tends to have a relatively smaller duration due to the overlapping of its start time by other components of emission then it will affect both variation rates of the flux density and spectral index in the same way and then the possible influence will be canceled .",
    "2 clearly shows that the early softening does have a different behavior relative to the rest .",
    "the fact that the grbs with lowest @xmath13 tend to deviate from the @xmath82 law may be partially due to the fact that @xmath39 is defined as the difference of the linear quantities @xmath13 and @xmath12 and we take the logarithm of @xmath39 and correlate it with the logarithm of @xmath13 .",
    "is it better that we use the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath12 rather than use @xmath39 ?",
    "the ratio , when passing to logarithms , becomes the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "is it a more suitable quantity to be correlated with @xmath85 ?",
    "we studied this issue by replacing @xmath39 with @xmath86 in fig .",
    "2 . we found a weak correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath83 ( the plot is omitted ) .",
    "the data are quite scattered in the @xmath88 vs. @xmath83 plane .",
    "the analysis does not provide any information of the causes of the mentioned deviation .",
    "this must be due to the fact that @xmath89 is closer to @xmath83 than @xmath90 is , as long as the discrepancy between @xmath13 and @xmath12 is large enough ( say , when @xmath13 is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath12 ) .    the strongest reason in favor of our suggestion of two types of origin might be that the two types of softening occur at very different time scales ( the former appears much earlier and the latter emerges very late ) .",
    "in addition we found that the early type softening is observed in the steep decay phase which is believed to be due to the high latitude emission of the prompt phase [ 6 , 9 , 11@xmath218 ] and the late type softening is found in the normal afterglow phase which was believed to be due to the external shocks [ 42@xmath244 ] .     and @xmath13 for the newly defined two types of the softening process .",
    "filled circles in the upper panel and open circles in the lower panel represent the process with @xmath91 ( the newly defined late type softening process ) . filled circles in the lower panel and open circles in the upper panel stand for the process with @xmath92 ( the newly defined early type softening process ) .",
    "the two solid lines are the same as they are in fig .",
    "2.,width=480 ]    it should be pointed out that the softening process is divided into two classes empirically .",
    "if the two kinds of softening are associated with internal and external shock mechanisms , it might be more natural to divide them according to the start time of the process . by examining the data in tables 1 and 2",
    ", we roughly redivided the softening process into two classes according to @xmath12 being less or larger than @xmath93 .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "4 are the relations between the duration and the terminating time of the softening process for the newly defined early and late types .",
    "as expected , they do not dramatically affect the result .",
    "the two types are distributed in two distinguishable domains in the @xmath39 vs. @xmath13 plane .",
    "however , a slight overlapping between the two distributions is observed .",
    "we do not know if this overlapping is due to the overlapping of physical parameters or merely the statistical fluctuation .",
    "one might notice that few of the new early type occupy the late type domain near the identical curve and few of the late type are located in the early type domain near the @xmath37 curve .",
    "both seem to be a result of the extension of the two types .",
    "we therefore insist that this possibility can not be ruled out with the current data .",
    "however , as an empirical analysis , we prefer the former division , i.e. dividing them according to @xmath13 , since no overlapping is observed in this division scenario .     and @xmath78 , during the softening process observed in the x - ray afterglows of the selected bursts .",
    "filled circles stand for the late type of softening and open circles for the early type.,width=480 ]    studied in fig .",
    "3 is the relation between the variation rates of the flux density and spectral index during the softening process .",
    "how it would be when we simply study the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath78 ?",
    "shown in fig .",
    "5 is the result .",
    "one finds that the two types seem to have different distributions of @xmath95 and @xmath78 .",
    "the late type softening tends to have smaller @xmath78 and slightly larger @xmath95 .",
    "however , the overlapping is so heavy that we can not tell the type of a softening merely according to its location in the @xmath95 vs. @xmath78 plane .",
    "this difference , if confirmed statistically later , might become a hint in searching the physical difference between the two softening processes .",

    "<S> the softening process observed in the steep decay phase of early x - ray afterglows of swift bursts has remained a puzzle since its discovery . </S>",
    "<S> the softening process can also be observed in the later phase of the bursts and its cause has also been unknown . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was suggested that , influenced by the curvature effect , emission from high latitudes would shift the band function spectrum from higher energy band to lower band , and this would give rise to the observed softening process accompanied by a steep decay of the flux density . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature effect scenario predicts that the terminating time of the softening process would be correlated with the duration of the process . in this paper , based on the data from the unlv grb group web - site </S>",
    "<S> , we found an obvious correlation between the two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we found that the softening process can be divided into two classes : the early type softening ( @xmath0 ) and the late type softening ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs. terminating time plot . in the relation between the variation rates of the flux density and spectral index during the softening process , a discrepancy between the two types of softening is also observed . according to their time scales and the discrepancy between them </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that the two types are of different origins : the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of external shock origin . </S>",
    "<S> the early softening is referred to the steep decay just following the prompt emission , whereas the late decay typically conceives the transition from flat decay to late afterglow decay . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that there might be a great difference of the lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible for the observed discrepancy . </S>"
