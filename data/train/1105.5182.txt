    "since @xmath4 is bounded the embedding of @xmath10 into @xmath8 is compact and the spectrum of @xmath7 is discrete .",
    "it consists of a series of positive eigenvalues @xmath11 accumulating at infinity only .    in general , the eigenvalues @xmath12 can not be calculated explicitly and especially for large @xmath13 it is difficult to evaluate them numerically .",
    "therefore it is interesting to describe the asymptotic behavior of @xmath12 as @xmath14 .",
    "this is equivalent to the asymptotics of the negative eigenvalues of the operator    ' '' ''",

    "@xmath15 in the semiclassical limit @xmath3 .",
    "the first general result is due to h. weyl who studied the counting function @xmath16 in 1912 he showed that the first term of its semiclassical limit is given by the phase - space volume @xcite : for any open bounded set @xmath17 the limit @xmath18 holds as @xmath3 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the volume of the unit ball in @xmath5 .",
    "h. weyl conjectured in @xcite that this formula can be refined by a second term of order @xmath21 depending on the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "this stimulated a detailed analysis of the semiclassical limit of partial differential operators .",
    "we refer to the books @xcite for general results and an overview over the literature .",
    "eventually , the existence of a second term was proved by v. ivrii by means of a detailed microlocal analysis @xcite : if the boundary of @xmath4 is smooth and if the measure of all periodic geodesic billiards is zero then the limit @xmath22 holds as @xmath3 , where @xmath23 denotes the surface area of the boundary .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the sum of the negative eigenvalues @xmath24 this quantity describes the energy of non - interacting , fermionic particles trapped in @xmath4 and plays an important role in physical applications .",
    "the asymptotic relation ( [ eq : int : ivrii ] ) immediately implies a refined formula for the semiclassical limit of @xmath25 : suppose that the aforementioned geometric conditions on @xmath4 are satisfied . then integrating ( [ eq : int : ivrii ] )",
    "yields @xmath26 as @xmath3 , with @xmath27    in the following we present a direct approach to derive the semiclassical limit of @xmath25 .",
    "we prove ( [ eq : int : trace ] ) without using the result for the counting function .",
    "since we do not apply any microlocal methods the proof works under much weaker conditions .",
    "our main result holds without any global geometric conditions on @xmath4 .",
    "we only require weak smoothness conditions on the boundary - namely that the boundary belongs to the class @xmath28 for some @xmath29 .",
    "that means , we assume that the local charts of @xmath4 are differentiable and the derivatives are hlder continuous with exponent @xmath30 .",
    "[ thm : main ] let the boundary of @xmath4 satisfy @xmath31 , @xmath32 . then the asymptotic limit @xmath33 holds as @xmath3 .",
    "our work was stimulated by the question whether similar two - term formulae hold for non - local , non - smooth operators .",
    "this is unknown , since the microlocal methods leading to ( [ eq : int : ivrii ] ) are not applicable .",
    "therefore it is necessary to use a direct approach .    indeed ,",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] can be extended to fractional powers of the dirichlet laplace operator @xcite .",
    "the strategy of the proof is similar but dealing with non - local operators is more difficult and elaborate . in order to give a flavor of our techniques",
    "we confine ourselves in this article to the local case .",
    "the question whether the second term of the semiclassical limit of @xmath25 exists for lipschitz domains @xmath4 remains open .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is divided into three steps : first , we localize the operator @xmath34 into balls , whose size varies depending on the distance to the complement of @xmath4 .",
    "then we analyze separately the semiclassical limit in the bulk and at the boundary .    to localize ,",
    "let @xmath35 denote the distance of @xmath36 to the complement of @xmath4 .",
    "we set @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a parameter depending only on @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , we will finally choose @xmath40 proportional to @xmath41 .    in section [ sec : loc ]",
    "we introduce real - valued functions @xmath42 with support in the ball @xmath43 .",
    "for all @xmath36 these functions satisfy @xmath44 and for all @xmath45 @xmath46 here and in the following the letter @xmath47 denotes various positive constants that might depend on @xmath4 , but that are independent of @xmath48 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 .    [ pro : loc ] for @xmath38 and @xmath49 we have @xmath50    in view of this result , one can analyze the local asymptotics , i. e. , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath51 separately on different parts of @xmath4 .",

    "[ pro : bulk ] assume that @xmath52 is supported in a ball of radius @xmath53 and that @xmath54 is satisfied .",
    "then for @xmath49 the estimate @xmath55 holds , with a constant depending only on the constant in ( [ eq : int : gradphi ] ) .",
    "close to the boundary of @xmath4 , more precisely , if the support of @xmath56 intersects the boundary , a term of order @xmath21 appears :    [ pro : boundary ] assume that @xmath57 is supported in a ball of radius @xmath53 intersecting the boundary of @xmath4 and that inequality ( [ eq : int : gradphi ] ) is satisfied .",
    "then for all @xmath58 and @xmath59 the estimate @xmath60 holds .",
    "here @xmath61 denotes the @xmath62-dimensional volume element of @xmath63 and the remainder satisfies @xmath64 with a constant depending on @xmath4 , @xmath65 and the constant in ( [ eq : int : gradphi ] ) .",
    "based on these propositions we can complete the proof of the main result .    in order to apply proposition [ pro : boundary ] to the operators @xmath66 , we need to estimate @xmath67 uniformly .",
    "assume that @xmath36 satisfies @xmath68 .",
    "then we have @xmath69 , which by definition of @xmath67 implies @xmath70 in view of ( [ eq : int : grad ] ) we can therefore apply proposition [ pro : bulk ] and proposition [ pro : boundary ] to all functions @xmath71 , @xmath36 . combining these results with proposition [ pro : loc ]",
    "we get @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "now we change the order of integration and by virtue of ( [ eq : int : unity ] ) we obtain @xmath75 it remains to estimate the remainder terms .",
    "note that , by definition of @xmath67 , we have @xmath76 for all @xmath36 .",
    "together with @xmath77 this implies @xmath78 for any @xmath79 . inserting these estimates into ( [ eq : int : remainders ] ) we find that the remainder terms are bounded from above by a constant times @xmath80 finally , we choose @xmath40 proportional to @xmath41 and conclude that all error terms in ( [ eq : int : remainders ] ) equal @xmath81 as @xmath3 .",
    "the remainder of the text is structured as follows . in section [ sec : asympt ] we analyze the local asymptotics and outline the proofs of proposition [ pro : bulk ] and [ pro : boundary ] . in section [ sec : loc ] , we perform the localization and , in particular , prove proposition [ pro : loc ] .",
