    "early in the 1960 s physicists already well realized that in high energy strong interaction the regge trajectory with vacuum quantum number , the pomeron , plays a particular and very important role in soft processes , such as the energy dependence of @xmath10 , the behavior of the elastic differential cross section @xmath11at small @xmath12 , the single and double diffractive dissociation processes in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . after the advent of qcd",
    ", physicists begin to study the nature of the pomeron in the qcd framework @xcite .",
    "since the pomeron carries the quantum number of the vacuum , in qcd language , it is a colorless entity , which leads to the diffractive events are characterized by a large rapidity gap , a region in rapidity devoiding of hadronic energy flow , this distinct class of events are observed by the zeus and h1 collaboration at hera in deep inelastic scattering region @xcite , which offer a unique chance to study the the soft scattering process with a hard virtual photon probe , therefore provide a more complete understanding of qcd .    in an orginal paper @xcite , it was suggested that hard diffractive scattering processes would give new and valuable insight about the nature of pomeron . the ingelman - schlein ( i - s ) model assumes that the hard diffractive scattering processes can be calculated in a factorized way : first",
    ", a pomeron is emitted from the diffractively scattered hadron , then partons of the pomeron take part in hard subprocesses , the results will be diffractively produced high-@xmath13 jets in @xmath14 collisions or larger rapidity gap events in diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) , so the partonic struction of the pomeron could be established and studied experimentally . these pridictions were confirmed subsequently .",
    "the ua8 collaboration at cern s @xmath15s collider with @xmath16 gev studied the diffractive jet distribution , indicates a dominant hard partonic structure of the pomeron , however , the diffractive dijet event topology alone can not distinguish between a hard - quark or a hard - gluon struction in the pomeron @xcite .",
    "the ddis and dijet photoproduction experiments at hera have shed light on the partonic structure of the pomeron .",
    "combining the measurements of the diffractive structure function in ddis and the photoproduction jet cross sections , the zeus collaboration gives the first experimental evidence for the gluon content of the pomeron and determines that the hard gluon fraction of the pomeron @xmath17 is in the range @xmath18 , independent of the validity of the momentum sum rule for the pomeron and the normalization of the flux of pomeron from the proton@xcite .",
    "the h1 collaboration also determines the fraction of the momentum of the pomeron carried by the hard gluon , which is @xmath19 at @xmath20 gev@xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 gev@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the partonic structure of the pomeron , based on the i - s model for hard diffraction , was also studied by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron through diffractive w production and dijet production @xcite @xcite , which give further evidence for the hard partonic stucture of the pomeron .",
    "combining these two experiments , the cdf collaboration determined the hard - gluon content of the pomeron to be @xmath25 , this result is also independent of the pomeron flux normalization or the validity of the momentum sum rule for the pomeron .",
    "however , there is a problem .",
    "the i - s model is based on the assumption of diffractive hard scattering factorization .",
    "recently , a factorization theorem has been proven by collins @xcite for the lepton induced diffractive hard scattering processes , such as ddis and diffractive direct photoproduction of jets .",
    "this factorization theorem justifies the analysis given by the zeus and h1 collaboration , and establishes the the universality of the diffractive parton distrubutions for those processes to which the theorem applies .",
    "in contrast , no factorization theorem has been established for diffractive hard scattering in hadron - hadron collisions . as already known before the advent of qcd",
    ", factorization fails for hard processes in diffractive hadron - hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to preserve the shapes of the @xmath26 and t distributions in soft single diffraction ( sd ) and predict correctly the experimentally observed sd cross section at all energy in @xmath27 collisions , goulianos @xcite has proposed to renormalize the pomeron flux in an energy - dependent way , this approach indicates the breakdown of the triple - regge theory for soft single diffractive exciation , and implies that diffractive hard factorization is likely breakdown in hadron - hadron collisions which appears to be confirmed by cdf experiments@xcite@xcite . at large @xmath12 , where perturbative qcd applies to the pomeron",
    ", it was proven that there is a leading twist contribution which broken the factorization theorem for diffractive hard scattering in hadron - hadron collision @xcite .",
    "evidence for this substantial coherent perturbative contribution has been observed by the ua8 experiment in diffractive jet production , in which the square of the proton s four - momentum transfer t is in the region @xmath28",
    "gev@xmath21 @xcite . on the other hand , for the pomeron at small @xmath12 ,",
    "nonperturbative qcd phycics dominates , where the i - s model without much of a coherent contribution would be appropriate .",
    "therefore , various hard diffractive processes may be considered to probe the partonic struction of the pomeron , and test the hard diffractive factorization in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite @xcite .",
    "recently , alero _",
    "et al._@xcite extract the parton densities of the pomeron from the hera data on ddis and diffractive photoproduction of jets , and use the fitted parton densities to predict the diffractive production of jets and weak bosons in @xmath27 collisions at the tevatron .",
    "the predicted cross sections are substantially high than the experimental data , which signals a breakdown of hard scattering factorization in diffractive hadron - hadron collisions .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss another diffractive process , the associated @xmath29 single diffractive production at large @xmath30 : p + |p p + + + x .",
    "this process is of special significance because the produced large @xmath30 @xmath31 is easy to detect through its leptonic decay modes and the @xmath31 s large @xmath30 is balance by the associated high energy photon .",
    "we will see through the following calculations , although the production cross section of associated @xmath32 is sensitive to the color - octet matrix elements , the ratio of the single diffractive production cross section to the inclusive production cross section are not so .",
    "we find that the ratio is sensitive to the product @xmath33 , where d is the renormalization factor of the pomeron flux(which indicates the factorization broken effects,)and @xmath17 is the hard gluon fraction in the pomeron .",
    "the measurement of this process at the tevatron and lhc would shed light on the nature of the pomeron and test the diffractive hard scattering factorization .",
    "furthermore , this process is also interesting to the study of heavy quarkonium production mechanism .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in detail our calculation scheme in sec.ii",
    ". a brief introduction of the heavy quarkonium production mechanism , the hard subprocesses for associated @xmath29 production and a summary of the kinematics related to the @xmath34 @xmath13 distribution are given in this section .",
    "our results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "based on the i - s model for diffractive hard scattering , the associated @xmath29 single diffractive production process at large @xmath13 consists of three steps(shown in fig.1 ) .",
    "first , the pomeron is emitted from the proton with a small squared four - momentum transfer @xmath12 .",
    "second , partons from the anti - proton and the pomeron scatter in the hard subprocesses that produce the almost point - like large @xmath13 pair of @xmath35 and a associated photon . in the third step , @xmath36 is produced from the point - like @xmath37 via soft gluon radiation .",
    "prior to 1993 , the conventional wisdom for heavy quarkonium production was based on the so - called color - singlet model ( csm)@xcite which assumes that the heavy quark pair is produced in a color - singlet state with the right quantum numbers of the final heavy quarkonium in the hard subprocesses and the belief that the dominant production processes for color - singlet @xmath37 were the feynman diagrams that were lowest order in @xmath38 . however , at the tevatron , the csm prediction for prompt @xmath34 production is an order of magnitude smaller than the cdf data at large @xmath13 .",
    "the first major conceptual advance in heavy quarkonium production was the realization that fragmentation dominates at sufficiently large @xmath13 @xcite which indicates that most charmonium at large @xmath13 is produced by the fragmentation of individual large @xmath13 partons .",
    "the fragmentation functions are calculated in csm , for example , the fragmentation fuction for @xmath39 is calculated from the parton process @xmath40 in csm . including this fragmentation mechanism brings the theoretical predictions for prompt @xmath34 production at tevatron to within a factor of 3 of the data @xcite .",
    "but the prediction for the @xmath41 remains a factor of 30 below the data even after including the fragmentation contribution ( the @xmath42 `` surplus '' problem ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the logarithmic infrared divergences in the production cross sctions for p - wave charmonium states and the annihilation rate for @xmath43 indicate csm is incomplete .",
    "all these problems indicate that some important production mechanism beyond csm needs to be included @xcite@xcite . and",
    "so the color - octet mechanism is proposed which is based on the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd)@xcite@xcite . contrary to the basic assumption of csm , the heavy quark pair in a color - octet state can bind to form heavy quarkonium .",
    "although the color - octet fragmentation picture of heavy quarkonium production @xcite has provided valuable insight , the approximation that enter into fragmentation computations break down when a quarkonium s energy becomes comparable to its mass .",
    "the fragmentation predictions for charmonium production are therefore unrealiable at low @xmath13 . in the case of @xmath44 production , the exist data at the tevatron are in the @xmath45 gev region , which significantly disagree with the fragmentation predictions . based upon the above several recently developed ideas in heavy quarkonium physics , cho and leibovich@xcite identify a large class of color - octet diagrams that mediate quarkonia production at all energies , which reduce to the dominant set of gluon fragmentation graphs in the high @xmath13 limit . by fitting the data of prompt @xmath36 and @xmath44 production at the tevatron , numerical values for the long distance matrix elements are extracted , which are generally consistent with nrqcd power scaling rules @xcite . in order to convincingly establish the color - octet machanism , it is important to test whether the same matrix elements be able to explain heavy quarkonim production in other high energy processes , such as inclusive @xmath34 production in @xmath46 annihilation on the @xmath47 resonace and inelastic @xmath31 photoproduction at hera _",

    "the long distance effects for the produced almost point - like @xmath37 to form the bound state are isolated into nonperturbative matrix elements .",
