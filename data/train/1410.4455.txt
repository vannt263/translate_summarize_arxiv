    "kashiwara @xcite introduced crystal bases as combinatorial analogues for irreducible representations of quantum groups . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with tensor products of the kirillov  reshetikhin crystals , which we loosely call affine crystals , associated to a certain class of finite - dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra @xmath1 .    as a set , an affine crystal @xmath2 of type @xmath3 is the direct product of sets of semistandard young tableaux ( with entries in @xmath4 ) , of rectangular shape @xmath5 .",
    "affine crystals are equipped with a remarkable combinatorial @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 that generates an action of the symmetric group @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",
    "rigged configurations are collections @xmath9 of partitions @xmath10 and integer sequences @xmath11 subject to certain conditions ( see section [ sec : rc ] ) .",
    "the rigged configurations were introduced in the papers @xcite , motiviated by the bethe ansatz for the isotropic heisenberg model ( see @xcite for the precise relation between them ) .",
    "the rigged configuration bijection @xmath12 @xcite establishes a bijection between the affine crystal , modulo the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix , and a set of rigged configurations .",
    "this bijection is reviewed in section [ sec : phi ] .",
    "is available at @xcite . ]    in recent years , it has been realized that rigged configurations can be thought of as action - angle coordinates of certain discrete dynamical systems known as box - ball systems @xcite ( see @xcite for related references ) .",
    "box - ball systems are surprisingly rich integrable systems defined using elementary rules ( see section [ sec : bbs ] ) . in the language of dynamical systems ,",
    "finding the rigged configuration is akin to solving an initial value problem , and the inverse @xmath13 of the rigged configuration bijection has been written down explicitly as piecewise - linear functions in the case @xmath14 @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for an introductory account ) .",
    "this inverse @xmath13 is expressed in terms of certain @xmath15-functions which play a similar role in this theory as the classical @xmath15-functions play in the traditional theory of integrable systems .",
    "the present work is concerned with a piecewise - linear description of the map @xmath16 , in the special case that @xmath14 is a product of one - row crystals .",
    "let @xmath17 .",
    "we let @xmath18 stand for the number of occurrences of the letter @xmath19 in @xmath20 .",
    "the rigged configuration @xmath21 is invariant under the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix action on @xmath8 , and thus we expect each part @xmath22 of each partition ( and also every rigging ) in @xmath21 to be expressed as a piecewise - linear expression in @xmath23 invariant under the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix .",
    "since the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix generates an action of the symmetric group @xmath7 , the answer we seek maybe thought of as a tropical analogue of a symmetric function .",
    "there is a rational - lifting of the entire story , where combinatorial crystals are replaced by geometric crystals @xcite , and combinatorial @xmath0-matrices by geometric @xmath0-matrices .",
    "for example , yamada @xcite considered a geometric analogue of the piecewise - linear formula @xcite of the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix for the tensor product of one row crystals and introduced the elementary loop symmetric functions as polynomial invariants for the geometric @xmath0-matrix .",
    "lam and pylyavskyy @xcite have studied the ring of polynomial invariants of the geometric @xmath0-matrix , called the ring of loop symmetric functions @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the energy function of the affine crystal is equal to the tropicalization of a loop schur function , the analogue of a schur function in the ring @xmath24 .",
    "the energy function plays a crucial role in affine crystal theory , especially in the relation with solvable lattice models .",
    "this project began with the hope that formulae for the rigged configuration @xmath21 could be obtained as tropicalizations of other distinguished elements in @xmath24 .    in theorem [ thm : cylindric ]",
    "below , we introduce cylindric loop schur functions and show that they are invariants of the geometric @xmath0-matrix .",
    "these are analogues in the ring @xmath24 of the cylindric schur functions studied by mcnamara @xcite and postnikov @xcite , in a very different context . our main conjecture ( conjecture [ conj : shapes ] ) states that each @xmath22 , as a function of @xmath23 , has an expression of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a particular cylindric loop schur function that we define .",
    "for the precise definitions , see section [ sec : main ] .",
    "we remark that direct computations of explicit piecewise - linear formulae for @xmath21 for certain examples are presented in @xcite ( see remark [ rem : berensteinkirillov ] ) .",
    "we prove our main conjecture in the case that @xmath27 , that is , we are concerned with the first part of the rigged configuration @xmath21 .",
    "this case is the most important from the point of view of box - ball systems : the sequence @xmath28 is exactly the sequence of lengths of the solitons in the corresponding box - ball system , arranged in increasing order . as a corollary",
    ", we obtain an upper bound for the number of solitons contained in a path ( corollary [ cor : number_of_solitons ] ) .",
    "another interesting property of the @xmath29 case is that we can write down the polynomials involved in this case in a very explicit form ( proposition [ prop : simple_formula ] ) .",
    "our proof relies heavily on the results of lam and pylyavskyy @xcite and sakamoto @xcite .",
    "we now discuss possible implications of our conjecture [ conj : shapes ] .",
    "the basic structure of our proof for the @xmath30 case ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) is as follows .",
    "the results of @xcite ( see theorem [ th : e = q ] ) expresses the partition @xmath30 in terms of combinatorial @xmath0-matrices and energy functions by using time evolutions of the box - ball systems ( see the diagram ( [ eq : def_bbs ] ) and definition [ def : energy ] ) . we make use of the explicit formula for the energy @xcite ( see theorem [ thm : lp ] ) to obtain theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "now the results of @xcite implies that the information of @xmath10 for @xmath31 is essentially connected with more general crystals @xmath32 even if we only consider the case @xmath33 .",
    "also the formulation of conjecture [ conj : shapes ] is uniform for arbitrary @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "a construction of geometric crystals for the general case @xmath34 is still an open problem .",
    "therefore it is tempting to say that our conjecture [ conj : shapes ] provides supporting evidence that geometric crystals for arbitrary kirillov  reshetikhin crystals @xmath34 should have a beautiful structure .",
    "we hope that our result provides a motivation for their construction .",
    "note that in @xcite okado has pursued a related idea of defining rigged configurations over @xmath35 , with the goal of eventually defining them over @xmath36 .",
    "our formulas accomplish exactly that for the special case of tensor products of one - row crystals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : bbs ] , we review necessary background on the box - ball systems and crystal bases . in section [ sec : rig ] , we review the theory of rigged configurations and the rigged configuration bijection . in section [ sec : loop ] , we review the theory of loop symmetric functions . then we introduce the cylindric loop schur functions and show that they belong to the ring of loop symmetric functions . in section [ sec : main ] , we formulate our conjecture about the shapes @xmath10 of the rigged configurations . in section [ sec : first - shape ] , we provide a proof for the case @xmath30 and discuss related subjects .",

    "we thank gabe frieden for pointing out a number of errors in an earlier version of this article , including an important correction to conjecture [ conj : shapes ] .",
    "the content of the present work is deeply interrelated with a remarkable discrete soliton system called the box - ball system . in the simplest case , the box - ball system is a dynamical system defined over sequences of positive integers which we call paths .",
    "the following is a typical example of the dynamics :    @xmath37 : ` 332424 ` + @xmath38 : ` 332424 ` + @xmath39 : ` 332424 ` + @xmath40 : ` 334242 ` + @xmath41 : ` 332442 ` + @xmath42 : ` 332442 ` + @xmath43 : ` 332442 ` + @xmath44 : ` 332442 `    here  `` \" is a substitute for the letter 1 which we regard as an empty place .",
    "the time evolution proceeds from top to bottom as indicated by the time variable @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath37 , we see three distinctive chunks of lengths 3 , 2 and 1 .",
    "we regard them as three solitary waves ( solitons ) . for @xmath46 ,",
    "these three solitons propagate at the velocity equal to each length . at @xmath47 , there are collisions of the solitons , though we regain lengths 1 , 2 and 3 solitons at @xmath48 .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of ordinary soliton systems .",
    "let us denote the path at time @xmath45 by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial state ( @xmath37 ) . in order to prevent the balls moving out of the path",
    ", we assume that the right part of @xmath50 is a sufficiently long sequence of the letter 1",
    ". then we have the following interpretation of the time evolution @xmath51 in terms of boxes and balls @xcite . in this picture",
    ", we regard paths as arrays of capacity one boxes and the letters @xmath31 as balls that can fill the boxes . then we introduce the operators @xmath52 @xmath53 which act on the paths by the following procedure :    1 .",
    "move the leftmost ball @xmath54 to the nearest empty place on the right .",
    "2 .   among the untouched balls @xmath54 ,",
    "move the leftmost @xmath54 to the nearest empty place on the right .",
    "3 .   repeat the procedure until all the balls @xmath54 are moved exactly once .",
    "suppose that the maximal number used in the path @xmath50 is @xmath55 .",
    "then we define @xmath56 when @xmath57 , the system reduces to the original takahashi  satsuma system @xcite .      in order to fully clarify the mathematical structures behind box - ball systems ,",

    "one of the nice properties of crystal bases is that they have a nice tensor product . as a set",
    ", @xmath69 is just the product of @xmath8 and @xmath70 and one can define the crystal structure on them in the following way . for @xmath71 , define the functions @xmath72 by @xmath73 then the kashiwara operators act on @xmath69 according to the following rule : @xmath74 note that we use kashiwara s original convention @xcite for the tensor product .",
    "the tensor product @xmath69 has two additional natural structures called the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix and the energy function @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial @xmath0-matrix is the unique crystal isomorphism which swaps the two components @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy function @xmath76 is defined by the following axiom . for an element @xmath77 ,",
    "suppose that we have @xmath78 .",
    "under this situation , we have the following four possibilities for the actions of kashiwara operators : @xmath79 then the function @xmath80 is uniquely defined by the following relations @xmath81 up to some additive constant . as a side remark ,",

    "let @xmath101 and @xmath102 be the following elements : @xmath103 then we have @xmath78 since we have @xmath104 in the tableau on the right hand side , we have one node which is outside of the shape @xmath105",

    "nowadays , rigged configurations are regarded as a canonical presentation of the affine crystals .",
    "for example , several highly non - trivial involutions of the underlying algebras have beautiful relationship with rigged configurations @xcite .    in section [ sec : definitions ] , we prepare several basic definitions about the rigged configurations which we need in both sections [ sec : rc ] and [ sec : phi ] . in section [ sec : rc ] , we define rigged configurations and in section [ sec : phi ] we describe the bijection between the tensor product of crystals and the rigged configurations .",
    "sections [ sec : rc ] and [ sec : phi ] are mostly independent with each other .      in this paper , we consider rigged configurations corresponding to tensor products of the form @xmath127 of type @xmath128 .",

    "otherwise let @xmath149 be the minimal length of the strings of @xmath140 with the rigging @xmath146 .",
