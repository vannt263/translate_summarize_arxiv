    "the pion form factor measurement is crucial for a number of physics problems .",
    "detailed experimental data in the time - like region allow a determination of the parameters of the @xmath14 meson and its radial excitations .",
    "extrapolation of the energy dependence of the pion form factor to the point @xmath15 provides a value of the pion electromagnetic radius .    in the energy range below @xmath16",
    "the process @xmath17gives the dominant contribution to the quantity @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 @xmath18 is an important measurable quantity widely used for various qcd tests as well as calculations of the dispersion integrals .",
    "for such applications , at high energies @xmath18 is usually calculated within the perturbative qcd frame , while for the low energy range the direct measurement of the @xmath20 cross - section is necessary .    particularly , knowledge of @xmath18 with high accuracy is required for the evaluation of the hadronic contribution @xmath21 to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( g-2)/2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of the experiment e821 @xcite running in brookhaven national laboratory is to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment with a relative precision of 0.35 ppm . within the standard model ( sm ) the uncertainty of the theoretical value of the leading order @xmath22",
    "is dominated by the uncertainty of the hadronic contribution @xmath21 calculated via the dispersion integral @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the qed kernel and @xmath25 is the cross section of @xmath26 hadrons .",
    "the precision of the @xmath21 calculation depends on the approach used and varies from 1.34 ppm based on @xmath1 data only @xcite to 0.53 ppm if in addition @xmath27-lepton decay data as well as perturbative qcd and qcd sum rules are extensively used @xcite .",
    "the major contribution to its uncertainty comes from the systematic error of the @xmath18 measurement at low energies ( @xmath28 2 gev@xmath29 ) , which , in turn , is dominated by the systematic error of the measured cross section @xmath17 .    assuming conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) and isospin symmetry , the spectral function of the @xmath30 decay can be related to the isovector part of the pion form factor @xcite .",
    "the detailed measurement of the spectral functions was provided by aleph @xcite , opal @xcite and cleo - ii @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the pion form factor measured at @xmath1 colliders with the spectral function of the @xmath30 decay provides a test of cvc .",
    "if cvc holds with high accuracy , @xmath27-lepton decay data can be also used to improve the accuracy of the calculations mentioned above @xcite .",
    "e821 has recently published the result of its measurement of @xmath31 with an accuracy of 1.3 ppm @xcite .",
    "the measured value of @xmath31 is 2.6 standard deviations higher than the sm prediction of @xcite .",
    "@xcite implies that the difference between experiment and theory reduces to about 1.5 standard deviations .",
    "] this observation makes new high precision measurements of the @xmath32 cross section and particularly of the pion form factor extremely important .    since early 70s",
    "the vepp-2 m @xmath1 collider has been running in the budker institute of nuclear physics in the c.m .",
    "energy range 360 - 1400 mev .",
    "the most precise pion form factor data were obtained in late 70s ",
    "early 80s by cmd and olya detectors @xcite .",
    "their accuracy was limited by systematic errors of the experiments , varying from 2% to 15% over the vepp-2 m energy range .",
    "the cmd-2 detector installed in 1991 is a general purpose detector consisting of the drift chamber , the proportional z - chamber , the barrel csi calorimeter , the endcap bgo calorimeter installed in 1996 , and the muon range system .",
    "the drift chamber , z - chamber and the endcap calorimeters are placed inside a thin superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t. more detail on the detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "though the collider luminosity has not considerably increased since the previous work in the 1980 s , the present detector design is significantly improved , resulting in a smaller systematic error of the pion form factor in this measurement .",
    "particularly , the following advantages of cmd-2 should be mentioned compared to previous detectors : simultaneous measurement of the particle momentum and energy deposition which simplified particle identification and helped to reduce background ; high precision determination of the fiducial volume with the help of the z - chamber ; a thinner beam pipe which reduced the nuclear interactions of pions .    during 1994 - 1995 a detailed scan of the c.m .",
    "energy range 610 - 960 mev was performed .",
    "since the pion form factor changes relatively fast in this energy range dominated by the @xmath2-meson , the systematic error due to an uncertainty in the energy measurement can be significant .",
    "to reduce this contribution to a negligible level , the beam energy was measured with the help of the resonance depolarization technique with an accuracy of 140 kev for almost all energy points @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the final analysis of the data taken in 1994 - 1995 with the integrated luminosity of about 310 nb@xmath33 and a systematic uncertainty of the cross section of 0.6% .",
    "preliminary results with a systematic uncertainty of 1.4% were published in @xcite , based on the same data sample .",
    "the data were collected at 43 points with c.m .",
    "energy ranging from 610 mev to 960 mev in 10 mev energy steps , except for the narrow energy range near the @xmath3-meson , where the energy steps were @xmath34 mev .    from more than @xmath35",
    "triggers recorded , about @xmath36 events were selected as _ collinear _",
    ", with a signature of two particles of opposite charge and nearly back - to - back momenta originating from the interaction point .",
    "the following selection criteria were used : [ collsel ]    1 .   two tracks of opposite charge originating from the interaction region are reconstructed in the drift chamber .",
    "the distance from the vertex to the beam axis , @xmath2 , is less than 0.3 cm and the z - coordinate of the vertex ( along the beam axis ) is within @xmath37 cm .",
    "3 .   the average momentum of the two particles @xmath38 is between 200 and 600 mev / c .",
    "the difference between the azimuthal angles ( in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis ) of two particles @xmath39 .",
    "the difference between the polar angles ( the angle between the momentum and the beam axis ) of two particles @xmath40 .",
    "the average polar angle of two particles @xmath41/2 $ ] is within @xmath42 .",
    "this criterion determines the fiducial volume .",
    "the selected sample of collinear events contains @xmath43 , @xmath17 , @xmath44 events ( below referred to as beam originating ) as well as the background of cosmic particles which pass near the interaction region and are misidentified as collinear events . the number of cosmic background events @xmath45 was determined by the analysis of the spatial distribution of the vertex .",
    "both distributions of the longitudinal coordinate ( @xmath46 ) and the distance from the beam axis ( @xmath2 ) are peaked around zero for the beam originating events , but are very broad , almost flat for the cosmic background events .",

    "the completion of the analysis of the @xmath47 data will also provide a possibility of the precise test of the cvc based relation between the cross section of @xmath8 and the spectral function in the decay @xmath48 .",
    "the solution of the problem of the possible deviation between @xmath1 and @xmath27-lepton data @xcite should also involve a thorough investigation of the effects of isospin breaking corrections as well as additional radiative corrections in @xmath27 decays @xcite .",
    "the following values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson parameters have been obtained with the gounaris - sakurai fit to the formfactor data : @xmath49    the measurement presented in this paper supersedes the preliminary result @xcite , obtained from the same data .",
