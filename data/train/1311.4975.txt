    "tailoring the optical properties of the medium along the transverse direction can open up a new possibilities of transferring the characteristics features of the control field to the probe field .",
    "this is because the propagation dynamics of probe field is dependent on the diffraction and dispersive properties of the medium .",

    "further , the transmitted cloned image has feature size four times smaller as compared to the initial control image .",
    "however , all of these schemes suffer from strong absorption due to breaking of two - photon resonance condition .",
    "hence the absorption based mechanism limits practical implementation .",
    "therefore , one can take advantages of gain based schemes to generate high resolution cloned image .",
    "resolution of cloned image can be improved by engineering the contrast of the refractive index of atomic waveguides of the gain medium .",
    "quantum interference effects induced by interacting dark resonances have been shown to drastically increase the contrast of the refractive index profile @xcite . in this paper ,",

    "we exploit these sharp spectral features to write waveguide inside medium .",
    "we begin with rayleigh limited control field structure and do a comparative study of inhomogeneous susceptibility for eit , microwave induced absorption ( mia ) , and lwi .",

    "we efficiently use this sharp refractive index contrast for cloning the rayleigh limited control field image to the probe field with high resolution .",
    "finally , we also show that sparrow limited three modes of the control image can also be cast onto the probe field with appreciable resolution and high transmission .",
    "later , we also use induced absorption and transparency mechanism to demonstrate the spatial switching ( off or on ) of probe beam .",
