    "we have recently reported  @xcite the observation of a novel two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic behavior in si metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) . in this regime ,",
    "the conductivity decreases as @xmath7 ( @xmath2  carrier density ) to a _ non - zero _ value as temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this simple @xmath8 spans two decades in @xmath9 ( @xmath10  k ) .",
    "several samples have been studied in detail and they all exhibit qualitatively the same behavior .",
    "[ st ] shows some typical results obtained in the lowest @xmath9 range .",
    "the substrate bias @xmath11  v was used to maximize the range of @xmath9 where this novel metallic behavior is observed  @xcite .    in 2d , the existence of a metal with @xmath12 is very surprising as it contradicts any theoretical description available to date .",
    "all the other related research efforts in recent years have considered only the metallic behavior with @xmath13 . however , some of the tremendous amount of work that was done on si mosfets in earlier decades has been largely ignored .",
    "in particular , all the samples from previous studies could be divided into two groups : one group exhibited the behavior consistent with that seen in high - mobility si mosfets  @xcite , but the other displayed various `` anomalies ''  @xcite that were never understood .",
    "our samples are representative of the latter , a _ broad _ class of si mosfets historically known as `` nonideal '' samples  @xcite .",
    "we have established  @xcite the precise form of @xmath14 in these devices .",
    "the data strongly suggest  @xcite the existence of a metallic phase at @xmath15 and of a novel , _ continuous _ metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in 2d .",
    "new analysis of some of the early data  @xcite has established  @xcite that the same @xmath14 is exhibited by a variety of both n - type and p - type si inversion layers , in both circular and linear geometries , with different channel lengths , substrate dopings , and oxide thickness .",
    "our samples are standard si mosfets of corbino geometry ( channel length @xmath16  mm , mean circumference @xmath17  mm ) , and a peak mobility @xmath18m@xmath19/vs at 4.2  k. other sample details have been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "conductance was measured as a function of gate voltage @xmath20 using a low - noise current preamplifier and a low - noise analog lock - in at @xmath21  hz .",
    "the excitation voltage was kept low enough to avoid electron heating .",
    "measurements were carried out in either a @xmath22 cryostat or a @xmath23 dilution refrigerator .",
    "@xmath24 was measured in fields of up to 18  t and for @xmath25  k.    while a detailed study of @xmath26 will be presented elsewhere  @xcite , here we show some typical magnetoconductance data obtained at @xmath27  k for several @xmath2 above the zero - field @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ mc ] ) .    very near the @xmath4 mit , a large initial drop of mc is observed with increasing @xmath0 , followed by a weaker dependence at higher fields . at higher @xmath2 ,",
    "the initial drop of mc appears to be less pronounced although @xmath5 continues to decrease with @xmath0 at all temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ mkrun ] ) . in    fact , a closer inspection of the data ( fig .",
    "[ mkrun ] inset ) reveals that , in the high field regime ( here @xmath29  t ) , @xmath5 decreases _ exponentially _ with @xmath0 .",
    "such a strong @xmath6 in the high field regime has been , so far , observed only in the very dilute 2d hole system in gaas  @xcite with the `` conventional '' metallic conduction ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the effect has been attributed  @xcite to the coupling of the parallel field to the orbital motion arising from the finite 2d layer thickness . in si - based devices , on the other hand ,",
    "a saturation in conductivity has been observed  @xcite at high fields .",
    "therefore , the behavior of our samples at high @xmath0 differs from that of other si mosfets . for our experimental conditions , the thickness of the 2d inversion layer is less than 5  nm  @xcite ( the magnetic length varies from 12  nm to 6  nm for @xmath30  t ) , _ i.  e. _ comparable to that in other si mosfets  @xcite .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that the difference in the high field response can be explained by the orbital effects  @xcite .    in the low field regime ,",
    "all devices seem to exhibit similar behavior .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the magnetic field above which the conductivity `` saturates '' is the field required to fully polarize the spins of free 2d carriers .",
    "other experiments , on the other hand , seem to support  @xcite an alternative possibility in which the parallel field polarizes spins in an `` external '' band of localized states , causing a change in scattering .",
    "so far , however , there has been no experimental attempt to identify the origin of this `` external '' band and to vary its population in samples with @xmath13 . in our samples , on the other hand , we have established  @xcite that the @xmath31 form of @xmath14 in the metallic regime is related to the population of localized states in the tail of the upper 2d subband .",
    "the number of occupied `` upper tail '' states was varied systematically by applying @xmath32 .",
    "it is intriguing that the same effects might be responsible for the behavior of magnetoconductance in these two , apparently very different , conduction regimes ( with @xmath33 and @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "while all experiments seem to suggest that spin degrees of freedom are playing an important role in dilute 2d systems , further work is clearly needed in order to reach a detailed microscopic understanding of the 2d metallic phase .",
    "in particular , `` non - ideal '' si mosfets are proving to be an invaluable resource .",
