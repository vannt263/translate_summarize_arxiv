    "dynamical mean - field theory @xcite has been remarkably successful at capturing the physics of strongly correlated systems dominated by spatially local correlations .",
    "successes include the description of the mott transition in the hubbard model , screening effects in the periodic anderson model , as well as the description of correlation effects in realistic systems  @xcite .",
    "since the introduction of the dynamical mean - field approximation ( dmfa ) there have been a number of attempts to develop formal extensions around the dmfa that incorporate non - local corrections .",
    "these include cluster extensions of the dmfa , such as the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite or the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft )  @xcite , and multi - scale approximations where the dmfa or dca vertices are used to parameterize two - particle field theories and longer ranged correlations can thus be captured  @xcite .",
    "one of the main limitations of these theories is that they converge slowly with the linear cluster size @xmath0 , especially for the calculation of transition temperatures .",
    "the dual fermion formalism  @xcite is however , distinctly different from other cluster extensions of the dmfa . in the dual fermion formalism",
    ", the lattice action is first mapped onto a dual fermion action where the interaction vertices are the n - body reducible vertices of the cluster .",
    "this mapping is exact , so the dual fermion formalism provides a complete and exact formalism for the lattice problem .",
    "thus far , the dual fermion formalism has only been explored using the dmfa or the cdmft as cluster solvers  @xcite . however , the cdmft has the disadvantage in this context that it violates translational invariance , so that the cdmft vertices are rank-4 tensors in the spatial or momentum indices , which are too large to be stored and manipulated on most computers , especially for large clusters .",
    "thus in this manuscript we propose the dual fermion dynamical cluster approach ( dfdca ) , within which the long - ranged correlations can be systematically incorporated through the dual fermion lattice calculation .",
    "since the dca preserves the translational invariance of the lattice system , the dca two - body vertices are rank-3 tensors which , for modest cluster sizes , will fit in the memory of modern computers .",
    "another difference , which we will discuss in detail , is that the small parameter for the dfdca is the dual fermion single - particle green function , which scales as @xmath3 with @xmath0 being the linear cluster size . as a result ,",
    "perturbation theory on the dual fermion lattice converges very quickly .",
    "simple second order perturbation theory on the dual fermion lattice already yields a dual fermion self - energy of order @xmath2 with two - body and three - body corrections down by an additional factor of @xmath1 .",
    "higher order approximations are also possible , since the , e.g. , three - body vertex corrections to the dfdca self - energy are small , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the resulting dfdca formalism converges very quickly with increasing cluster size , with corrections to the self - energy no larger than @xmath4 .",
    "we will derive the dfdca formalism with the example of the hubbard model .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the matrix of hopping integrals , @xmath7 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for electrons on lattice site @xmath8 with spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the intra - atomic repulsion .",
    "the dmfa , and its cluster extensions such as the dca , are based upon the common idea of embedding a cluster in a lattice .",
    "we assume that the cluster , of size @xmath12 , dimensionality @xmath13 , sites labeled by @xmath14 and wavevectors @xmath15 , is embedded in a large but finite - sized lattice of size @xmath16 with sites @xmath8 and wavevectors @xmath17 . in the dca , the reciprocal space of the lattice is divided into @xmath18 cells of identical geometry and linear size @xmath19 .",

    ", we employ different approximation schemes : the self - consistent second - order perturbation theory ( sopt ) , flex and the parquet approximation ( pa ) @xcite .",
    "the results are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev_nc1 ] , where the power of dfdca manifests itself clearly .",
    "the simple second - order correction from the self - energy is already able to reduce the nel temperature by ten percent .",
    "taking into account more feynman diagrams with higher orders , for example by flex or pa , continues to reduce the nel temperature .",
    "however , the inclusion of vertex correction tends to increase the nel temperature again .",
    "for example , the eigenvalues labeled @xmath143 are calculated with a bare dual fermion vertex and flex dressed legs , while those labeled @xmath144 are calculated with both flex dressed legs and vertex ( see b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcequation ] for contributions up to second - order in the bare dual fermion vertex @xmath55 ) .    up to now",
    "we have only discussed the leading eigenvalues of the vertex function .",
    "of course , the dfdca also allows to calculate the full susceptibility from the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "two typical results for an @xmath145 dca cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_nc4 ] , as function of temperature for @xmath146 . in the left panel ,",
    "the inverse staggered susceptibility for half filling is displayed , while the right one contains results for the inverse @xmath147-wave pairing susceptibility at a filling @xmath148 .",
    "due to the heavy computational cost for the parquet calculation , here we only use the sopt and flex in our dual fermion lattice calculation .",
    "although @xmath149 is not really large , the dfdca is still able to significantly reduce the mean - field nel and the abnormally large superconducting transition temperatures .     and @xmath150 . the linear dependence of the results with @xmath151 ( see fig .  [ fig : lev_lc2 ] )",
    "is used to extrapolate the @xmath152 limit results.,width=302 ]    it is quite interesting to note , that for the anti - ferromagnetic channel at half - filling , sopt and flex produce similar results , both being different from the dca results .",
    "the effect of vertex correction is small in this case",
    ". for the @xmath147-wave pairing susceptibility at @xmath134 , on the other hand , sopt in dual space makes almost no difference from the dca results , but the flex tends to significantly reduce the pairing susceptibility .",
    "again , the inclusion of vertex correction has the opposite effect , i.e. , it leads to a slight increase of the critical temperatures .    in the derivation of the dfdca approach",
    ", we have assumed that the dual fermion lattice is infinite .",
    "however , in practical calculations , the size is limited due to the algebraic increase of the computational cost .",
    "this results in some deviations from the infinite size system .",
    "[ fig : lev_lc2 ] shows the @xmath153 ( @xmath138 ) dependence of the leading eigenvalues for different dca clusters .",
    "the nice linear dependence of the leading eigenvalues on @xmath151 can be readily observed .",
    "this is due to the periodic boundary conditions used in the dual - fermion calculation .",
    "this property allows us to reduce the computational cost of our calculation by using two small @xmath154 and extrapolating to obtain a rather accurate approximation of the @xmath152 result .",
    "dependence of the leading eigenvalue for different dca clusters .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath146 , @xmath140 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    ", width=302 ]",
    "the dual fermion mapping as discussed in section  [ sec : dfdca_derivation ] is exact , and the approximation is made only when performing the diagrammatic calculation for the dual fermion lattice .",
    "justified by the scaling behavior of the dual fermion green function , it suffices to consider the 2-body term of the interaction and use low order perturbation theory .",
    "correlations beyond the dca cluster size are systematically restored through the dual fermion calculation on the lattice . in this sense ,",
    "the dfdca can be seen as a diagrammatic expansion around dca .",
    "this is manifested in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_d0 ] and [ fig : lev_nc1 ] where we see that not including the dual fermion self - energy and vertex corrections reproduces the dca transition temperature .",
    "when these corrections are included , we observe a systematic suppression of the dca transition temperature resulting in a more realistic value .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev_nc1 ] and [ fig : chi_nc4 ] . since correlations at intermediate length - scale are taken into account by the dual fermion lattice calculation",
    ", we can use small clusters in the underlying dca calculation . as a result , we are able to greatly reduce the adverse effect of the minus sign problem encountered in qmc simulations for larger clusters , and access a wider region of parameter space .",
    "the dfdca has an additional advantage that it is parameterized by the full ( reducible ) vertex function calculated on the dca cluster .",
    "other multi - scale methods@xcite rely upon the calculation of the cluster irreducible or fully irreducible vertices .",
    "our recent numerical experiments show that inverting the bethe - salpeter equation to obtain the irreducible vertex , which is also the first step in the calculation of the fully irreducible vertex , fails in some parameter regions , especially for large @xmath11 or near half filling .",
    "this difficulty is avoided in the dfdca .",
    "the dual fermion mapping also assumes that the dual fermions are treated on an infinitely large lattice . in practice",
    "however , they are treated on a finite - size lattice .",
    "thanks to the finite - size scaling behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lev_lc2 ] , finite - size calculations are used to extrapolate to the infinite - size lattice , leading to a reduction of the computational cost in the dual fermion lattice calculation .    note",
    "that in the calculations presented here , we have not performed the full self - consistency where the dual fermion result is used to determine the dca cluster hybridization that is fed back into the dca calculation until convergence . however , this first iteration already produces more satisfactory values for the nel temperature as well as the d - wave superconducting transition temperature .",
    "we can anticipate that the full self - consistency will further improve the performance of this approach .",
    "with the full self - consistency implemented and tested , we are planning to apply this approach to map out the phase diagram for the 2-d hubbard model in the hole - doped region .",
    "in addition , we are also working on applying this approach to the falicov - kimball model and the anderson disorder model recently .",
    "we have designed a new multi - scale many body approach , the dual fermion dynamical cluster approach ( dfdca ) , by combining the dca and the recently introduced dual fermion formalism .",
    "the dfdca uses both single and two particle quantities calculated in dca as the input for the dual fermion calculation .",
    "different self - consistent diagrammatic approximations can be used in the dual fermion lattice , which systematically restores the long - ranged correlation ignored during the dca calculation .",
    "this approach is a systematic expansion around the dca calculation .",
    "our numerical experiments show that the zeroth order result ( @xmath157 ) reproduces the original dca , and for any non - trivial dual fermion calculation , it is an improvement on the dca calculation .",
    "we applied different self - consistent diagrammatic methods , self - consistent 2nd - order , flex and parquet approximation , on the dual fermion lattice .",
    "they all improved the dca calculation by reducing the mean - field nel temperature by different amounts .",
    "in addition , the abnormally large superconducting transition temperature of the four site cluster calculation can be reduced by this approach as well .",
