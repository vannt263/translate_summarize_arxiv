    "the past three decades have seen the discovery of hundreds of planetary debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and a multitude of planets , either via radial - velocity surveys ( e.g. , harps - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , transit surveys ( e.g. , kepler - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or direct imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "together these discoveries have promoted exoplanetary system astronomy to a very prominent field of study . however , each of these tools probes only a small part of exoplanetary system behavior , and to understand more we need to combine these individual insights ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "circumstellar planetary debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have the potential to probe : 1 . )",
    "the evolution of the populations of small bodies , e.g. exoasteroids and exo - kuiper - belt - objects ; 2 . ) recent major stochastic events such as exoasteroid collisions ; 3 . ) placement of critical zones , such as ice lines ; and 4 . )",
    "indirect indications of the existence and placement of planets .",
    "for example , we see debris disks fade at rates consistent with monotonic evolution from a formative stage , consistent with expectations for collisional cascades within exo - asteroidal belts , similar to the behavior of our asteroids @xcite . in some cases , particularly in young systems ,",
    "there is direct evidence for huge collisions , either through spectral features indicative of fine silica dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or other very finely divided crystalline material , or through variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "imaged disks often show two distinct planetesimal zones analogous to the asteroid and kuiper belts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and many unresolved systems have temperature structures suggestive of a similar dual disk structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". these structures may reflect ice line positions in the ancestral protoplanetary disks , with subsequent modification of the disk structure by planets .",
    "in fact , the putative planets have been imaged in some debris disk systems ( fomalhaut , hr 8799 , @xmath2 pic , hd95086 , fw tau , roxs 12 , roxs 42b , hd 106906 * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the architectures of the disks in these systems are generally in agreement with the predictions from current disk ",
    "planet interaction models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the influence of metallicity as measured by [ fe / h ] can in principle provide additional insights to planetary system formation and evolution , especially as an indicator of other heavy elements , such as the building blocks of organic molecules and planets ( c , n , o , si ) . as an example , the discovery that the number of massive , hot planets increases rapidly with increasing metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in qualitative agreement with expectations , has inspired many hypotheses for the exact mechanism responsible ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how varying opacity affects - if at all - planet formation is still debated in planet formation theory .",
    "while higher metal content is an indication of a generic higher density of available building material in the systems , it also may play a crucial role in the physics driving planet formation itself . while @xcite found only negligible variations in his gravitational instability models , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "find that lower metallicity systems cool faster and fragment more , aiding core accretion processes .",
    "this , however , also means that proto - planets in metal rich systems may have more time to accrete matter and form giant planets .    on first principles ,",
    "higher metallicity should also favor the development of massive debris disks , since the necessary raw materials are then more abundant .",
    "indeed , if the numbers of debris parent bodies are proportional to the metallicity , the prominence of debris disks might increase faster than proportionately since the collision rates should go roughly as the square of the space density of parent bodies .",
    "these trends might be countered if the sinks for planetesimals - assimilation into planets , or ejection from the system - have a countervailing dependence on metallicity .",
    "however , the numbers of the planets in the most common mass range - super - earths to neptunes @xcite - have at most a weak dependence on metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , as direct sinks for planetesimal raw material they should have a neutral effect , or perhaps even reduce the available material at low metallicity .",
    "the fraction of stars with jupiter - mass planets is low , @xmath3 1% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it would be surprising if their prowess at ejecting planetesimals had a noticeable effect on the overall incidence of debris disks .    despite these arguments , virtually all searches for a relation between stellar metallicity and the presence of debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find none .",
    "@xcite report a hint of a deficit of disks at low metallicity , but this behavior was not confirmed in a later paper @xcite , possibly because of the smaller sample in the latter work . within the errors , these works are consistent with the incidence of debris disks being independent of the stellar metallicity .    with the exception of those by @xcite , these previous searches for a metallicity / debris disk relation",
    "have each been based on no more than @xmath4 40 detected debris disk systens .",
    "any systematic effects must be recognized out of a huge range of disk - creating activity , disk evolutionary behavior , and significant measurement errors , placing a premium on averaging down the scatter with large numbers and on minimizing systematic effects .",
    "the era of major space - based surveys for debris disks is now past ( with the demise of iras , iso , cryo - spitzer , akari , cryo - wise , and herschel ) .",
    "it is therefore timely to combine the results from these missions to gain significantly in the statistical significance of debris disk studies .",

    "to be specific , the previous studies simply compared the stellar metallicity distribution of sources with or without detected excesses of any size , whereas it is the disk masses that should correlate with metallicity .",
    "furthermore , the previous work does not take debris disk evolution into account which , if ignored , will dilute any other effects on disk incidence because after a certain age stars of all metallicities will have few debris disks .",
    "thus , a more sensitive search for a correlation between metallicity and the presence of debris disks should convert the debris disk emission levels to mass , correct to a common time , preferably one at a young age where the result should be representative of the dust mass in the protoplanetary disk @xcite , and work with the full distribution of detected masses and upper limits .",
    "it would also be desirable to treat separately the warm and cold debris disk components @xcite that evolve independently and at quite different rates @xcite . in this paper , we introduce all of these improvements .",
    "we also review the previous assumptions ( e.g. , on metallicity determination vs.  spectral type ) to identify any that might have undermined detection of an effect . because of the new modeling approach and the large sample , we do find a dependence of disk mass on metallicity for both warm and cold disk components , at modest statistical significance .",

    "the relative values of the disk parameters are important , so a consistent set of models is adequate without requiring that the models be correct in an absolute sense ( which would , e.g. , require consideration of more complex grain compositions ) .",
    "the modeled evolution of the system flux is fitted to the observed emission using the scaling laws we introduced in @xcite . as detailed there ,",
    "since the evolution is always slower than @xmath19 and the evolutionary tracks scale along @xmath19 as a function of system mass , there is only a single solution to the scaling of the evolutionary track .",
    "this scaling yields the true zero - age system dust mass in units of the original modeled system mass .",
    "once the correct scaling is found , system variables ( such as dust mass ) can be calculated at any point in time during the evolution of the system .",
    "modeling of the disks took on average @xmath20 8 days for each disk , at which point the mid- and/or far - ir flux evolutionary track of the system could be scaled along a @xmath19 axis in such a way that it intersected the observed system flux , as detailed above . using a 32 node computer cluster , running the code for all 662 systems took altogether over 15 cpu years .    in figure",
    "[ fig : deage ] , we show the process of deaging the systems .",
    "since our initial particle size distribution is slightly shallower than the final steep size distribution that results from a collisional cascade @xcite , the emission of the disks actually increases in the initial phase of the disk evolution while the system is settling into its quasi steady state . this can be seen for some of the lower initial mass systems in figure [ fig : deage ] . therefore , we define `` zero - age '' at 1 myr .",
    "the initial conditions of the systems are somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , apart from the previously mentioned settling phase , they will not greatly affect the evolution .",
    "we verified this by analyzing the results at multiple ages near the `` zero - age '' point .",
    "we calculated the total system dust mass at these points in time , by integrating the particle size distributions calculated by our numerical code at the corresponding model time and scaling by the factor determined from the flux fits for each system .",
    "the distributions are integrated up to 1 mm in radius and the final disk dust masses are divided by the masses of their central stars ( in solar units ) to place all systems on similar scales .",
    "this final step also makes the disk mass metric analogous to metallicity . due to the many orders of magnitude covered in disk mass space and only a few factors of difference in stellar masses , the normalization by stellar mass did not make a noticeable difference in our final results . in our figures",
    "we plot `` reduced masses '' , which are the disk dust masses divided by earth mass and the mass of the central star in solar units ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we summarized the warm and cold disk properties in tables [ tab : warmd ] and [ tab : coldd ] , respectively .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the observed fraction of warm debris disks , with excesses 10% above the stellar photosphere , decay to only a few percent for sources older than @xmath22 .",
    "this trend is independent of the spectral - type of the host star . since our code models quasi - steady state collisional cascades , we only include sources with ages up to 500 myr in our correlation analysis , as many sources that are older are likely experiencing a late - stage stochastic event . with this cut ,",

    "we have tried to extract more information about the relationship between disk mass and stellar metallicity by carrying out linear regression on the low and high metallicity portions of our sample .",
    "there are significant challenges in doing so : the dataset we are analyzing has errors in both variables ( metallicity and system dust mass ) and also has censoring ( upper limits on the dust mass ) for some of the data .",
    "the errors in metallicity were derived when we merged the catalogs ( as described in section [ sec : feh ] ) , while the errors in the de - aged dust masses were calculated based on the photometry errors , with de - aging performed using the flux values at the error boundaries as well .",
    "an ideal method would include upper limits as censored data , as well as allowing for these sources of error .",
    "we evaluated two linear regression techniques for this purpose , the gaussian mixed bayesian ( gmb ) method @xcite and the akritas - theil - sen ( ats ) estimator @xcite .",
    "datasets with errors in both variables and with censoring have been shown to be reasonably well fit with gmb linear regression methods .",
    "as a first approach , we fit our data using said method with the linmix_err algorithm developed by @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "both the metallicity and de - aged dust masses have significant heteroscedastic errors and the metallicity vs.  dust mass plots show large scatter with outliers and censoring .",
    "the gmb regression method is skewed by outliers , as it assumes a gaussian error distribution for ( y|x ) . however , our dataset has a non - uniform and non - gaussian error distribution , and the upper limits in our sample do not reflect simple gaussian errors due to the differing source distances .",
    "these issues were apparent upon inspection of the gmb fits , so we decided this approach was not applicable in our situation .",
    "the theil - sen @xcite regression slope estimator modified by @xcite , is able to filter outliers and also use censored data .",
    "the classic theil - sen estimator gives the regression slope as the median slope of all pairs of sample points .",
    "this algorithm was modified by @xcite to allow for censoring . to take into account data errors we bootstrapped using the errors in the data , generating 1000 random sets with the data distributed based on the parameter errors .",
    "we then fitted the distributions with the cenken ats routine in r , which finds the regression slope via iterations , with the solution being the slope that yields a kendall @xmath40 of 0 when removing the values of the test - slope from the data .",
    "therefore , any non - zero regression slope also means a non - zero value of the kendall @xmath40 .",
    "we divided the warm and cold samples at @xmath1 } = 0 $ ] and used the ats estimator to fit slopes to each metallicity bin .",
    "the results are in figure [ fig : coldc ] ; for simplicity , we only show them for the full spectral sample de - aged to 1 myr . the narrow range in metallicity results in large errors in the slopes . for three cases , warm disks with @xmath1 }",

    "since their early discovery @xcite , debris disks have always been thought of as signposts of planetary systems . however , there are few examples where direct connections between debris disk properties and those of exoplanetary systems have been established . in this paper",
    "we revisited this conundrum .",
    "we gathered _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data on 199 warm disks ( of which 125 only have upper limits ) and 463 cold disks ( of which 315 only have upper limits ) around 478 hosts . through the merging of 33 individual spectral catalogs",
    ", we also collected metallicity data for these systems .",
    "using our collisional cascade model @xcite , we then `` de - aged '' the systems , yielding dust masses for the systems at the time of their formation .",
    "we found multiple indications that massive debris disks are uncommon at low stellar metallicity ( e.g. , @xmath1 } < -0.2 $ ] . although not all of these indicators individually are at a high level of statistical significance , their combination points to a real avoidance by debris disks of low metallicity environments .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the planet - metallicity correlation @xcite and the core - accretion formation model @xcite ( where the heavier elements aggregate into dust and further on to planetesimals ) and the type ii migration models of close orbit giant planets @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the planet - metallicity correlation is a result of system initial conditions rather than acquired via accretion , i.e.  planetary systems with close orbit giant planets are more likely to form from molecular clouds with higher initial metal content .",
    "debris disks generally bound the regions of giant planet formation , with the warm components defining the inner and the cold components the outer edges .",
    "our finding therefore corresponds roughly with the strong dependence of the incidence of giant planets on metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
