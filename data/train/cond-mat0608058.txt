    "a lot of effort has been made to obtain a complete and wider bandgap .",
    "it has been shown that a triangular lattice of air holes in a dielectric background has a complete bandgap for te ( transverse electric ) mode , while a square lattice of dielectric rods in air has a bandgap for tm ( transverse magnetic ) mode @xcite .",
    "the devices operating in the bandgap frequencies are not the only option to guide the flow of light .",
    "another waveguiding mechanism is the total internal reflection ( tir ) in one - dimensional ( 1-d ) periodic dielectric rods @xcite .",
    "it is analysed in @xcite that a single row of dielectric rods or air holes supports waveguiding modes and therefore can be also used as waveguide . in @xcite ,",
    "the design of such waveguides consisting of several rows of dielectric rods with various spacings is proposed .",
    "recently , a new method for guiding electromagnetic waves in structures whose dimensions are below the diffraction limit has been proposed .",
    "the structures are termed as ` plasmonic waveguides ' which have an operation of principle based on near - field interactions between closely spaced noble metal nanoparticles ( spacing @xmath0 ) that can be efficiently excited at their surface plasmon frequency .",
    "the guiding principle relies on coupled plasmon modes set up by near - field dipole interactions that lead to coherent propagation of energy along the array .",
    "analogous structures as waveguides in microwave regime include periodic metallic cylinders to support propagating waves @xcite , array of flat dipoles which support guided waves @xcite , and yagi - uda antennas @xcite etc .",
    "however , although these structures can be scaled to optical frequencies with appropriate material properties , their dimensions are limited by the so - called diffraction limit @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "plasmonic waveguides employ the localisation of electromagnetic fields near metal surfaces to confine and guide light in regions much smaller than the free space wavelength and can effectively overcome the diffraction limit .",
    "previous analysis of plasmonic structures includes the plasmon propagation along metal stripes , wires , or grooves in metal @xcite , and the coupling between plasmons on metal particles in order to guide energy @xcite etc .",
    "such subwavelength structures can also find their applications e.g. efficient absorbers and electrically small receiving antennas at microwave frequencies .",
    "recently composite materials containing randomly distributed electrically conductive material and non - electrically conductive material have been designed @xcite .",
    "they are noted to exhibit plasma - like responses at frequencies well below plasma frequencies of the bulk material .",
    "the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite is seen as the most popular numerical technique especially because of its flexibility in handling material dispersion as well as arbitrary shaped inclusions . in @xcite , the optical pulse propagation below the diffraction limit",
    "is shown using the fdtd method .",
    "also with the fdtd method , the waveguide formed by several rows of silver nanorods arranged in hexagonal is studied @xcite . despite these examples of applying the fdtd method for the plasmonic structures ,",
    "the accuracy of modelling has not been proven yet . when modelling curved structures , unless using extremely fine meshes , due to the nature of orthogonal and staggered grid of conventional fdtd , often modifications need to be applied in order to improve the numerical accuracy , such as the treatment of interfaces between different materials even for planar structures @xcite , and the improved conformal algorithms using structured meshes @xcite for curved surfaces .",
    "in addition to the modifications at material interfaces , the material frequency dispersion has also to be taken into account in fdtd modelling @xcite . however , modelling dispersive materials with curved surfaces still remains to be a challenging topic due to the complexity in algorithm as well as the introduction of numerical instability .",
    "an alternative way to solve this problem is based on the idea of effective permittivities ( eps ) @xcite in the underlying cartesian coordinate system , and the dispersive fdtd scheme can be therefore modified accordingly without affecting the stability of algorithm . in this paper , we first propose a novel conformal dispersive fdtd algorithm combining the eps together with an auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method @xcite , then apply the developed method to the modelling of plasmonic waveguides formed by an array of circular or elliptical shaped silver cylinders at optical frequencies .",
