    "empirical studies have shown that even the simplest survey sampling strategies , such as simple random sampling without replacement , are very competitive with signal processing approaches such as wavelet expansions , when the aim is to estimate the mean consumption curve . to test and compare the different possible strategies ,",
    "a test population of @xmath0 electricity meters has been installed in small and large companies .",
    "these electricity meters have read electricity consumption every half an hour over a period of two weeks .",

    "we decided to retain @xmath137 different clusters based on the quartiles so that all the strata have the same size .",
    "the mean trajectories during the first week in the clusters , drawn in figure [ fig : strata ] ( a ) , show a clear size effect .",
    "the strata have been numbered according to global mean consumption .",
    "stratum 4 , at the top of figure [ fig : strata ] ( a ) , corresponds to consumers with high global levels of consumption whereas stratum 1 , at the bottom of figure [ fig : strata ] ( a ) , corresponds to consumers with low global levels of consumption .",
    "we compared three sampling strategies , with the same sample size @xmath138 to estimate the mean population curve @xmath139 and build confidence bands during the second week . in order to evaluate these estimators",
    ", we drew 1000 samples using the following sampling designs ,    * simple random sampling estimator without replacement , which was first tested by electricit de france ; * stratified sampling with proportional allocation , in which allocation in each stratum is defined as follows @xmath140 ; the size of each stratum is 500 ; * stratified sampling with optimal allocation according to the rule defined in  ( [ optimal - allocation ] ) .",
    "the sizes of the strata are 126 ( stratum 1 ) , 212 ( stratum 2 ) , 333 ( stratum 3 ) and 1329 ( stratum 4 ) .    to evaluate the accuracy of the estimators , we considered the following loss criteria , evaluated with discretized data using quadrature rules , for the estimator @xmath141 respectively @xmath142 of the mean trajectory , respectively of the mean variance , @xmath143    basic statistics for the estimation errors of the mean function are given in table [ tab - result - norm ] .",
    "first , we observe that clustering the space of functions by means of stratified sampling leads to a large gain in terms of the accuracy of the estimators .",
    "in addition , there is a substantial difference between the proportional and the optimal allocation rules .",

    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab - result - norm ]    we now examine the true standard deviation functions @xmath146 , which are proportional to the width of the confidence bands .",
    "they depend on the sampling design and are drawn in figure [ fig : strata ] ( b ) .",
    "the theoretical standard deviation is much smaller , at all instants @xmath147 for the optimal allocation rule , and it is about twice smaller compared to simple random sampling without replacement .",
    "there is also a strong periodicity effect in the simple random sampling without replacement due to the lack of control over the units with high levels of consumption ( stratum 4 ) .",
    "estimation errors , according to criterion ( [ def : mur ] ) , of the true covariance functions are reported in table [ tab - result - norm ] .",
    "the error is much smaller for stratified optimal allocation than for the other estimators ; optimal allocation provides better estimates as well as better estimation of their variance .",
    "finally , we computed the global confidence bands to check that formula ( [ eq - confidence - bands ] ) , which relies on asymptotic properties of the supremum of gaussian processes , remains valid when considering confidence levels 0@xmath10795 and 0@xmath10799 .",
    "the empirical coverage is close to the nominal one for the simple random sampling without replacement , 93@xmath1078% and 98@xmath1073% , whereas it is a little bit liberal , especially for smaller levels , for the stratified sampling designs , 88@xmath1077% and 96@xmath1078% for proportional allocation , and 88@xmath1071% and 96@xmath1078% for optimal allocation .",
    "the experimental results on a test population of electricity consumption curves confirm that stratification , in conjunction with the optimal allocation rule , can lead , in cases of such high dimensional data , to important gains in terms of the accuracy of the estimation and width of the global confidence bands compared to more basic approaches .",
    "we have proposed a simple rule to get confidence bands that could certainly be improved , in terms of empirical coverage , by computing more realistic scaling factors with bootstrap procedures ( faraway , 1997 ) or gaussian process simulations ( degras , 2010 ) .    choosing appropriate strata is also an important aspect of such improvement .",
    "nevertheless , it will generally be impossible to determine for all units to which cluster they belong .",
    "borrowing ideas from breidt & opsomer  ( 2008 ) , one possible strategy is to perform clustering on the observed sample and then try to predict to which stratum the units that are not in the sample belong using auxiliary information and supervised classification .",
    "we have assumed that the observed trajectories are not corrupted by noise at the discretization points .",
    "although this assumption seems quite reasonable in the case of electricity consumption measurements , it is not true in general .",
    "thus , linear interpolation may not always be effective and linear smoother estimators , such a kernels or smoothing splines , would probably be more appropriate ways to obtain functional versions of the discretized observations .    finally , another direction for future research is to combine optimal allocation for stratification with model - assisted estimation when auxiliary information is available .",
    "there are close relationships between the shape of electricity consumption curves and variables such as past consumption , temperature , household area or type of electricity contract .",
    "such an estimation procedure relies , as noted in cardot _",
    "et al . _  ( 2010 ) , on a parsimonious representation of the trajectories in order to reduce the dimension of the data .",
    "one way to achieve this is to first perform a functional principal components analysis and then to model the relationship between the principal components and the auxiliary information .",

    "<S> we propose here a horvitz  thompson estimator of the mean trajectory . in the context of a superpopulation framework </S>",
    "<S> , we prove under mild regularity conditions that we obtain uniformly consistent estimators of the mean function and of its variance function . with additional assumptions on the sampling design we state a functional central limit theorem and deduce asymptotic confidence bands . </S>",
    "<S> stratified sampling is studied in detail , and we also obtain a functional version of the usual optimal allocation rule considering a mean variance criterion . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques are illustrated by means of a test population of @xmath0 electricity meters for which we have individual electricity consumption measures every 30 minutes over one week . </S>",
    "<S> we show that stratification can substantially improve both the accuracy of the estimators and reduce the width of the global confidence bands compared to simple random sampling without replacement </S>",
