    "relativistic jets have been observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and microquasars in our galaxy , and it is believed that they originate from the regions near accreting black holes or neutron stars @xcite . to investigate the dynamics of accretion disks and the associated jet formation , we use a full 3-d grmhd code .",
    "one of the most promising models for jet formation is the magnetic - acceleration model @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - acceleration mechanism has been proposed not only for agn jets , but also for protostellar jets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , koide , shibata , & kudoh ( 1999 ) @xcite have investigated the dynamics of an accretion disk initially threaded by a uniform poloidal magnetic field in a non - rotating corona ( either in a state of steady fall or in hydrostatic equilibrium ) around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "the numerical results show that the disk loses angular momentum by magnetic braking , then falls into the black hole . the infalling motion of the disk , which is faster than in the non - relativistic case because of the general - relativistic effect below @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the schwarzschild radius ) , is strongly decelerated at the shock formed by the centrifugal force around @xmath5 by the rotation of the disk .",
    "plasmas near the shock are accelerated by the @xmath6 force , which forms bipolar relativistic jets . inside this _ magnetically driven jet _ , the gradient of gas pressure also generates a jet over the shock region ( _ gas - pressure - driven jet _ ) .",
    "this _ two - layered jet structure _ is formed both in a hydrostatic corona and in a steady - state falling corona .",
    "koide et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite have also developed a new grmhd code in kerr geometry and have found that , with a rapidly rotating ( @xmath7 ) black - hole magnetosphere , the maximum velocity of the jet is 0.9 c and its terminal velocity 0.85 c. all of the previous 2-d grmhd simulations described here were made assuming axisymmetry with respect to the @xmath0-axis and mirror symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath8 ; the axisymmetric assumption suppressed the azimuthal instabilities .",
    "our basic equations are those of maxwell for the fields and a set of general - relativistic equations representing the plasma , namely the equations of conservation of mass , momentum , and energy for a single - component conducting fluid @xcite .",
    "our simulations employ the equations of general - relativistic mhd together with the simplified total - variation - diminishing ( stvd ) method .",
    "the stvd method was developed by davis ( 1984 ) @xcite for studying violent phenomena such as shocks @xcite .",
    "this method is as lax - wendoroff s method with additional diffusion term .",
    "we have checked that this method respects the energy - conservation law and its propagation properties @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate how accretion disks near black holes evolve under the influence of accretion instabilities such as the magnetorotational instability @xcite and accretion - ejection instability ( aei ) @xcite , the use of a fully 3-d grmhd is essential .      in the assumed initial state , the simulation region",
    "is divided into two parts : a background corona around a black hole , and an accretion disk ( fig .",
    "the coronal plasma is set in a state of transonic free - fall flow , as in the case of the transonic flows with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; here the sonic point is located at @xmath11 .",
    "the keplerian disk in the corona is set in the following way .",
    "the disk region is located at @xmath12^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "( note that this equation reduces to the newtonian keplerian velocity @xmath13 in the non - relativistic limit @xmath14 ) .",
    "the pressure of both the corona and the disk are assumed equal to that of the transonic solution .",
    "the initial conditions for the entire plasma around the black hole are : @xmath15 @xmath16    @xmath17    where we set @xmath18 ; the smoothing length is @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , there is a magnetic field crossing the accretion disk perpendicularly .",
    "we set it to the wald solution @xcite , which represents the uniform magnetic field around a kerr black hole : @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the lapse function , @xmath23 ) . at the inner edge of the accretion disk ,",
    "the proper alfvn velocity is @xmath24 in a typical case with @xmath25 , where the alfvn velocity in the fiducial observer , @xmath26/c^2}}$ ] .",
    "the plasma beta of the corona at @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "the simulation is performed in the region @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 meshes .",
    "the effective linear mesh widths at @xmath33 and at @xmath34 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , while the angular spacings along the polar and azimuthal directions are @xmath37 rad .",
    "a radiative boundary condition is imposed at @xmath38 and at @xmath39 .",
    "the computations were made on an origin 2000 computer with 0.898 gb internal memory , and they used about 47 hours of cpu time for 10000 time steps with @xmath32 meshes .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of 3-d simulation performed in the region @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 with @xmath32 meshes .",
    "the parameters used in this simulation are the same as those of the axisymmetric simulations shown in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "the colored shading shows the proper mass density on logarithmic scales ; the vector plots show the magnetic field .",
    "the black circle represents the black hole .",
    "figures 1a presents the initial conditions , which are the same as in the 2-d simulations @xcite . at @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "1b ) comparing with fig .",
    "6c ( @xmath44 ) in @xcite the jet is less generated . at @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "1c , the jet is generated as 2-d simulation at the earlier time ( @xmath44 ) . at @xmath46 , the jet is clearly created around @xmath47 , which is shown by the enhanced density ( fig .",
    "1d ) . as in the 2-d simulations",
    "the jet is generated in a hollowed cylindrical form .",
    "the delay of jet formation seems to be due to reduction of shock formation at @xmath5 caused by the additional freedom in the azimuthal direction .",
    "further investigation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "recently , review articles on magnetohydrodynamic production of relativistic jets have reported unsolved questions related to jet formation and its mechanisms which determine the velocity of jets and time variations of jet flux @xcite .",
    "this simulation result is initial and we will perform more simulations and investigate effects of the third dimension .",
    "this simulation study will be extended to understand the different ( high / soft and low / hard ) states @xcite and different combination of accreting rate @xmath48 and the angular momentum @xmath49 @xcite .",
