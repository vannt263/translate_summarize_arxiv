    "understanding itinerant electronic systems with competing ordering tendencies is among the most profound challenges in today s condensed matter theory . in one - dimensional systems ,",
    "powerful theoretical tools are available for answering some of the questions@xcite , but extending the techniques to higher dimensions has met with limited success . often the problem is how to treat the various ordering tendencies on equal footing without an inherent bias towards any one of the possible ordered states .    in this",
    "regard , bilayer graphene at , and near , the neutrality point can be regarded as a model system . to a first approximation , there is a conduction band and a valence band that touch quadratically near two points , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "even when all electron - electron interactions are ignored , such a system would have low - temperature susceptibilities which diverge as @xmath2 towards a number of different ordered states . while there are no known exact solutions , such a situation is expected to lead to instabilities with respect to infinitesimal electron - electron interactions .",
    "the challenge is then to identify the conditions under which any one combination of the various possible states gets preferably selected as the temperature is lowered .",
    "since a many - body ordering appears already at weak coupling this problem is amenable to the renormalizaton group ( rg ) approach , whose advantage is that it can account for the competing tendencies in an unbiased way .",
    "moreover , since the few - milli - electron - volt energy scales associated with ordering extracted from present - day experiments@xcite are much smaller than the natural upper cutoff in the problem originating from the split - off bands derived from the dimerized sites ( @xmath3 mev ) , the physical system itself is expected to be well described by a weak coupling theory .",
    "therefore , we expect that the competition among the number of inherently strong - coupling phases can be accessed within such a weak coupling approximation .    the previous rg treatments of this problem presented in refs .",
    "consisted of first building a low - energy effective field theory , which , when electron - electron interactions are neglected , can be thought of as a gaussian fixed point of the rg scale transformation @xcite with dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "except under some non - generic fine - tuned initial conditions , contact interactions have been shown to be marginally relevant at this fixed point .",
    "such four - fermion terms in the low - energy effective field theory arise from microscopic electron - electron interactions @xmath5 whose fourier transform is non - divergent in the small wavevector limit .",
    "they could , for instance , correspond to @xmath6 coulomb interactions screened by proximity to metallic gates . within this approach ,",
    "the electronic modes with momenta in a thin shell @xmath7 near the cutoff @xmath8 , and arbitrary frequency @xmath9 , are integrated out , while the change in the effective action is monitored as the process is iterated@xcite . to determine the leading instability ,",
    "infinitesimal symmetry breaking source terms were introduced @xcite and included in the process of renormalization . the source term with the strongest divergence",
    "was then identified as the most dominant ordering tendency . in the case of purely forward scattering , or , in the notation of this paper , for @xmath10 only , the leading instability was found to be toward the electronic nematic state .",
    "this state is gapless , with either two or four dirac points near each @xmath0-point depending on the strength of the order parameter . in the case of the hubbard model",
    ", there is additional back scattering , @xmath11 , and layer imbalance scattering @xmath12 , and the leading instability is found to be toward the layer antiferromagnetic state .",
    "the single - particle ( electronic ) spectrum of this phase is gapped .    in a similar approach@xcite",
    ", the @xmath6 coulomb interactions among the electrons in bilayer graphene were first screened using rpa , and then the full @xmath13- and @xmath9-dependent effective interaction was used as the initial condition for the subsequent wilson - like rg treatment . while said approach can be criticized on the grounds that the screening of the long - range tail of the coulomb interaction originates from integrating out electrons all the way down to the fermi energy , which are double counted when reintroduced for the rg treatment , the results obtained using this approach are in qualitative agreement with the results obtained previously@xcite .    to this end , we present an extension of the previous rg treatment of the problem to finite temperature@xcite and finite externally applied perpendicular electric field .",
    "this allows us to include the competition between broken - symmetry phases with gaps in the electronic spectrum , which may be energetically favorable , and gapless states , which may be entropically favorable .",
    "we also study the gradual suppression of an ordered state as the externally applied electric field is increased .",
    "since temperature is treated explicitly , we can obtain the transition temperature directly , without making any of the _ ad hoc _ assumptions inherent in translating the value of the rg scale @xmath14 at which the couplings diverge into temperature .    as has been noted early on in the context of one - dimensional electron systems@xcite",
    ", it is very useful to compare the results of an approximate rg approach to known exact results@xcite . despite the scarcity of exact results in higher dimensions",
    ", we can compare our results to some of the non - trivial properties of the hubbard model at half - filling , which can be either established exactly@xcite or can be obtained from monte carlo simulations @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it was shown in ref .   that starting with a repulsive hubbard model on a honeycomb bilayer lattice at half - filling for @xmath15 leads to the layer antiferromagnet as the most dominant instability .",
    "in this work , we confirm the previous finding using the finite - temperature rg scheme .",
    "we further establish that , if we fix the value of the nine four - fermion coupling constants to correspond to the values derivable from the hubbard model , then the low - energy effective field theory possesses the so(4 ) symmetry of the microscopic hubbard model@xcite . as a consequence , for an attractive hubbard model the result of our ( approximate ) rg analysis recovers the _ exact _ result that the @xmath16-wave superconducting order parameter can be continuously rotated to the `` cdw '' order parameter@xcite . since , for bilayer graphene , the charge - ordered state does not break the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice , it is not strictly a density wave , but rather corresponds to the layer - polarized state ( lp ) .",
    "this can be seen in our rg equations ; the lp and @xmath17 superconducting source terms are identical provided that we start with the values of the four - fermion coupling constants corresponding to the hubbard model with @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , since , in the weak coupling limit , we can map the microscopic lattice interactions to the four - fermion coupling constants in the continuum effective field theory , we can ask what happens when we add a @xmath18-@xmath19 interaction @xmath20 in addition to the on - site attraction @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ blglatticediagram ] ) .",
    "when @xmath20 is repulsive ( attractive ) we find that the exact degeneracy between the lp and @xmath17 sc states is lifted in favor of the lp ( @xmath17 sc ) as expected@xcite .    among the differences between our present approach and the related weak coupling approach employed in refs .",
    "is the fact that we perform our analysis at finite temperature , which leads to different rg equations for the couplings than at zero temperature .",
    "in addition to the advantages mentioned above , this allows us to systematically determine all possible outcomes of the rg equations in the nine - dimensional space of initial couplings .",
    "we also avoid screening the coulomb interaction with the bilayer graphene low - energy degrees of freedom that enter our wilson rg analysis .",
    "rather , we assume that it is screened due to either finite temperature or the presence of external metallic gates .",
    "finally , we do not rely on mean - field theory to determine the phases either directly from the bare couplings ( i.e. , without rg ) @xcite , or on a renormalized mean field treatment@xcite .",
    "the shortcomings of other approaches@xcite have been discussed in ref . .    within this formulation ,",
    "as shown later in the text , the flow equations for the nine@xcite coupling constants contain additional thermal factors , with an effective temperature @xmath22 that grows under rg as @xmath23 .",
    "the flow equations for the coupling constants describe two competing tendencies  the term proportional to a product of two four - fermion coupling constants tends to enhance their growth , while the thermal factors suppress the flow of the coupling . for any fixed initial couplings and at a high enough temperature , the couplings saturate to finite values as @xmath24 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the coupling constants saturate at higher , but still finite , values . at the transition temperature , @xmath25 ,",
    "the coupling constants diverge as @xmath24 . below @xmath25 ,",
    "the coupling constants diverge at a finite value of @xmath14 .",
    "the effects of trigonal warping , parametrized by a velocity @xmath26 , can be readily included within this formalism as well @xcite . like temperature ,",
    "trigonal warping tends to suppress the flow of the couplings . as a result , even at @xmath27 , a critical coupling strength must be exceeded for a phase transition to occur@xcite .",
    "the strength of the critical coupling vanishes as @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "the rg flow equations of the ( infinitesimal ) source terms for a multitude of symmetry - breaking order parameters reveal that , at the transition temperature , the source terms @xmath28 acquire an anomalous dimension , @xmath29 .",
    "analysis of the free energy correction to @xmath30 further reveals that , within this approximation , the physical susceptibility for a particular @xmath28 diverges as @xmath31 if @xmath32 . using this condition",
    ", we determine the phase diagram for different initial couplings ( see fig .",
    "[ figphasediagramtv3 ] ) .",
    "we find that , for purely forward electron - electron scattering , @xmath10 , the only order parameter with a divergent susceptibility at finite @xmath22 is the nematic .",
    "moreover , this is stable with respect to the presence of small , but finite , back scattering @xmath33 and layer imbalance scattering ( i.e. , the difference between intra- and interlayer scattering ) @xmath34 . performing the analysis at finite temperature is crucial for revealing this stability . upon increasing the back and layer imbalance scattering",
    ", the only other divergent susceptibility is toward a layer antiferromagnetic ( af ) state . reversing the sign of the back scattering while fixing the layer imbalance scattering results in a quantum spin hall state ( qsh ) .",
    "reversing the sign of the layer imbalance scattering while fixing the sign of the back scattering gives us a layer - polarized state ( lp ) .",
    "reversing the sign of both may lead to an @xmath16-wave superconductor . for small @xmath35 and @xmath36",

    "we find that , if a coupling constant diverges , it grows as @xmath23 . at the same time",

    "away from any special filling , a metallic state is also correctly predicted @xcite .",

    "therefore , if the rg procedure had been performed exactly , none of these susceptibilities would have diverged as long as the temperature was finite .",
    "interestingly , in this regard , the nematic state is different .",
    "this is because , when trigonal warping is included , as it is in our model , the broken rotational symmetry is _ discrete _ and thus it is possible to have a finite - temperature transition into this phase in 2d . as argued previously@xcite , this transition is continuous and belongs to the 3-state potts model universality class@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the _ non - mean - field _",
    "exponents determined approximately from our fermionic model at one loop should not be expected to be accurate .",
