    "in monte carlo studies of statistical systems undergoing phase transitions , critical slowing down is one of the prominent problems .",
    "consider a monte carlo algorithm with dynamic exponent @xmath6 . in order to generate a given number of effectively independent samples , one has to spend computing effort @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the linear sytem size and @xmath9 accounts for the volume of the sytem of interest .",
    "for the local metropolis algorithm for the potts model , the dynamic exponent is around @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in two dimensions , the required computing effort grows like @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , a central task of computational statistical physics is to develop algorithms such that @xmath12 vanishes or is significantly suppressed . for a discussion of monte carlo methods ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the potts model ,",
    "a significant breakthrough was the invention of the swendsen - wang cluster method  @xcite and its single - cluster version  the wolff cluster method  @xcite . for the two- and three - dimensional ising model ,",
    "the dynamic exponent of the sw algorithm is about @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite , respectively . in comparison with the metropolis simulations , the critical slowing down",
    "is significantly suppressed .",
    "in addition to the potts model , another important class of models in statistical physics is the @xmath0 model .",
    "the @xmath0 model is defined in terms of @xmath2-component spins on a lattice , with an isotropic pair coupling of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are a pair of neighboring lattice sites and @xmath18 is a function .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the honeycomb @xmath0 model , where function @xmath18 is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a measure of the inverse temperature .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0 model has a nice graph representation  @xcite ; the graph consists of a number of nointeracting and nonoverlapping loops on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "however , in contrast to the potts model , an efficient cluster algorithm is still lacking for the @xmath0 model .",
    "when simulating the @xmath0 model , one has to apply a metropolis - like local algorithm , except for some special cases such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "even worse is that local updates of loop configurations require some global connectivity information .",
    "therefore , the computing effort grows like @xmath23 as @xmath8 increases , where the exponent @xmath24 accounts for the effective critical slowing down due to the global - connectivity - checking procedure .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is close to @xmath4 in two dimensions , unless some complicated data structure is applied .",
    "apart from the above computational considerations , developing efficient algorithms for the @xmath0 loop model is also highly desirable from physical point of view .",
    "this is because , while much exact information about the critical properties of the @xmath0 loop model has been accumulated in the past decades , many open questions still exist ; for some recent publications , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . as a generalization",
    ", dilution can be introduced into the @xmath0 loop model and the potts model . for",
    "a sufficient number of diluted sites , a different universality class can arise at the so - called tricritical point .",
    "in contrast to the tricritical potts model , exact results for the tricritical @xmath0 model are scarce . therefore , a high - precision numerical study of the @xmath0 model is of great importance .    in this work",
    ", we solved the long - standing problem of developing an efficient algorithm for the @xmath0 loop model for @xmath1 .",
    "we apply the newly developed cluster algorithm , an embedding swendsen - wang - type cluster method , to the honeycomb @xmath0 loop model without dilution , for which many exact predictions are available .",
    "the numerical data confirm the exact predictions by coulomb gas theory and by conformal field theory .",
    "further , the dynamical data imply that , for @xmath25 , the embedding cluster algorithm _ hardly _ suffers from critical slowing down .",
    "let us consider a plane graph @xmath26 and its dual graph @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the total numbers of vertices and of edges of @xmath30 , respectively , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for graph @xmath33 .",

    "loops_. in addition , it is required that these loops can not share a common bond  .",
    "the weight of such a loop configuration is given by @xmath35 , and the partition sum is @xmath36 where the sum is over all satisfied loop configurations .",

    ", parameters @xmath39 and @xmath2 can be any real or complex numbers . in this work , we shall only consider real numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that we have a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "first , let us further restrict our attention to the case where @xmath1 is an integer , and define a @xmath2-color ashkin - teller ( at ) model  @xcite on the dual graph @xmath33   was considered .",

    "ii still works .    because of usage of the symmetry among the @xmath2-color spin variables , one would expect that modes of the critical slowing down , associated with this symmetry , are significantly suppressed in the last version of the embedding sw algorithm .",

    "[ fig_tau1_25 ] , we also fitted the @xmath389 data by @xmath438 indeed , all the data can be well described by eq .",

    "by making use of the equivalence of the loop configurations of the @xmath0 loop model and the low - temperature graph of the ashkin - teller model in the infinite - coupling limit ( iat ) , we formulated an embedding swendsen - wang - type algorithm for the @xmath0 loop model with real value @xmath1 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "this algorithm reduces to the conventional swendsen - wang method for the ising model . with some modifications , an embedding wolff - type method ( single - cluster version )",
    "is readily available .",
    "we then applied our cluster algorithm to the @xmath0 loop model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the numerical data reveal the finite - size scaling behavior of several quantities .",
    "the associated exponents are confirmed to be those exact values predicted by the coulomb gas theory and by conformal field theory .    the dynamical data",
    "strongly imply that the embedding cluster algorithm suffers little from critical slowing down .",
    "this is somewhat impressive in the sense that the dynamic exponent @xmath12 of the swendsen - wang type algorithm must satisfy the li - sokal bound  @xcite : @xmath442 , unless it can be proved that the amplitude of terms with exponent @xmath443 vanishes .",
    "the value of @xmath444 can be easily calculated from eq .",
    "( [ critical_exponent ] ) , which yields @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , and @xmath64 for for @xmath387 , @xmath226 , @xmath233 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the absence of a dynamic exponent @xmath448 in the embedding sw simulations of the @xmath0 loop model implies that the amplitude for terms with exponent @xmath449 indeed vanishes .",
    "we argue that this is because our embedding sw cluster algorithm has made use of the symmetry among the @xmath2 colors of ising spins .",
    "similar scenarios exist elsewhere .",
    "for instance , it can be proved that , in metropolis simulations of the ising model , the dynamic exponent @xmath12 must satisfy @xmath450 .",
    "however , the dynamic exponent @xmath12 of the swendsen - wang algorithm is much smaller than @xmath451 .",
    "this is because the symmetry between the up- and down - pointing ising spins is fully taken into account in the swendsen - wang algorithm . to have a better understanding of our above argument ,",
    "let us consider another version of swendsen - wang - type cluster method for the iat or the @xmath0 model with integer @xmath2 , as described in sec .",
    "this algorithm directly simulates each color of the spin variables @xmath44 in the iat model for @xmath452 . in the language of loop configurations ,",
    "the algorithm only updates loops in the same color ; it does not interchange or reassign colors of loops . in other words , the symmetry among loops in different colors is not taken into account . such a cluster algorithm has been applied to the critical @xmath56 iat model on the triangular lattice , which is equivalent to the critical @xmath102 model on the honeycomb lattice or the baxter - wu model .",
    "it was found that the dynamic exponent @xmath12 for the integrated correlation time is @xmath453 ; indeed , @xmath12 satisfies the li - sokal bound : @xmath454 .    instead of the individual spin variables",
    "@xmath44 , the final version of the embedding sw algorithm simulates the product variable @xmath455 .",
    "after each update of spin variable @xmath105 , the colors of loops are reassigned randomly , irrespective of the existing colors of loops . in this sense , it is natural that dynamic exponent @xmath456 vanishes .",
    "the @xmath22 loop model is just the ising model . from universality",
    ", one has @xmath458 for the @xmath459 model on any planar graph . on the honeycomb lattice , eqs .",
    "( [ critical_exponent ] ) and ( [ relation_gq ] ) tell that @xmath460 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath461 for @xmath25 . in this sense",
    ", our cluster algorithm still satisfies the li - sokal bound . since the value of @xmath460 decreases as a function of @xmath2 , it is also expected that , as @xmath2 increases , the value of @xmath381 decrease .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath395 in table  [ table_fit_tau ] .",
    "it is clear from sec .",
    "iii that the embedding cluster algorithm described in this work can not be applied to the @xmath462 case . nevertheless , since all the loop configurations are the low - temperature graphs of the @xmath105 spin variable , and vice versa .",
    "it seems that , for @xmath463 , a reweighting modification of the swendsen - wang simulation of the ising model can still be useful .",
    "such a procedure can be described as    * * step 1 .",
    "* for a spin configuration @xmath464 , in which the number of loops is @xmath38 , generate a new spin configuration @xmath465 by using the swendsen - wang algorithm .",
    "* * step 2 . *",
    "derive the loop information for the new configuration @xmath465 , and calculate the loop number @xmath466 .",
    "accept the new configuration with probability @xmath467 , namely , set @xmath468 .",
    "otherwise , keep the old spin configuration @xmath105 .    repeating of these two steps",
    "forms a valid ` cluster ' algorithm for @xmath469 . for the @xmath0 loop model on the honeycomb lattice",
    ", it turns out that , for @xmath470 and small system sizes @xmath471 , this algorithm works pretty well .",
