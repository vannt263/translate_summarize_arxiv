    "the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 iijima_1991 and their unique properties differing from bulk material have stimulated the study of one - dimensional ( 1-d ) nano - sized materials . among them , silicon carbide nanocables have been focused as a potential candidate for light - emitting device , nano - reinforced composite materials , nanoelectronic devices and catalyst supports due to their outstanding properties such as wide band - gap , high hardness , excellent thermal conductivity , high electron mobility , high saturation drift velocity , good chemical inertness , etc wpqin_2003 . in general , the as - synthesized sic nanowires contain amorphous @xmath0 on their surfaces and have sic-@xmath0 core - shell structure .",
    "recently , this structure has been attracting much attention owing to their potential applications for optoelectronic device and field emitter wmzhou_2006,rwu_2015 . for application of nano - materials , it is important to understand their several properties as well as to synthesize them in various forms .",
    "fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) provides the important information about the several chemical bond states of the sample .",
    "the phonon states in nano - sized particle or wire differing from those in bulk will be reflected in infrared ( ir ) absorption spectra .",
    "but , to our knowledge , a few reports wwang_2007,hwshim_2007,ksenthil_2008,gfzou_2006,xli_2011 related to ir absorption properties of sic-@xmath0 nanocables have been presented and most of them were restricted to confirm the characteristic band positions of si - c and si - o bonds . in our earlier study",
    "ryongjin_2010 , we found a shoulder peak of sio antisymmetric stretching mode centered at 1130@xmath1 , and attributed it to the interface effect of the open structure of chainlike @xmath0/sic nanocables on the base of the comparison to the prior report qlhu_2003 .",
    "but , our further study showed that the shoulder peak of sio antisymmetric stretching mode could not be attributed to above mentioned origins .",
    "furthermore , we found a novel peak centered at 910@xmath1 from sic-@xmath0 nanocables in the ir absorption measurement . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the likely origin of these two peaks based on some experimental data and theoretical calculations .",
    "sic-@xmath0 nanocables were synthesized by use of ethanol pyrolysis .",
    "ethanol is thermally decomposed into co , @xmath2o , @xmath3@xmath4 , c@xmath5 , @xmath3@xmath5 , and @xmath2 at about @xmath6 and the higher temperature above @xmath7 induces the decomposition of hydrocarbon into c and @xmath2 ruiz_2007 . at about @xmath8 ,",
    "the main products are co and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the use of thermal decomposition of ethanol allows us to obtain carbon source for synthesis of sic-@xmath0 nanocables at low cost ryongjin_2010 . in our experiment ,",
    "silicon source for synthesis sic-@xmath0 nanocables was generated by use of the reaction between si(111 ) substrate ( 0.09@xmath9 cm , n - type ) and pyrolysis productions of ethanol ryongjin_2010 , ryongjin_2009 .",
    "the experimental details for synthesis of sic-@xmath0 nanocables were presented in our earlier report ryongjin_2010 .",
    "we used five flow ratios between ar and ( ar+ethanol ) , 98:2 , 96:4 , 94:6 , 92:8 , and 90:10 , for synthesis of nanocables having different core diameters and shell thicknesses .",
    "after synthesis , the whole surface of the si substrate was covered with white - colored product . beyond the range of the flow ratios used in this experiment , the surface of si substrate showed no more white color and changed from wheat to black in color ryongjin_2010 .",
    "the synthesized products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) , energy - dispersive x - ray diffraction ( eds ) , ftir , and raman spectroscopy .",
    "sem images of nanocables synthesized at the flow ratios of 98:2 fig . [ fig:1](a ) and 90:10 fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) were presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "randomly oriented large - scale nanocables have been uniformly synthesized on the surface of si substrate .",
    "high - magnification sem images show that the nanowires synthesized at 98:2 flow ratio have smooth surface and those synthesized at flow ratio of 90:10 have rough one .",
    "the mean diameter of nanowires synthesized at flow ratio of 98:2 and 90:10 were estimated to be about 140 nm and 200 nm , respectively .",
    "based on low - magnification tem observation fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and [ fig:2](b ) , the as - synthesized one dimensional nanostuructures have core - shell structure . with decreasing the ethanol flow , the thickness of shell increased and the core diameters decreased . for instant ,",
    "mean diameter of cores and mean thickness of shells were estimated to be 40 nm and 50 nm at 90:10 flow ratio , respectively .",
    "for those synthesized at 98:2 flow ratio , the values were estimated to be 10 nm and 90 nm , respectively . based on our previous reports ryongjin_2010 , the nanocables synthesized by use of ethanol pyrolysis consisted of crystalline sic cores and amorphous @xmath0 shells .",
    "saed ( selected area electron diffraction ) patterns [ inserts in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) ] recorded from the nanocables also confirm the existence of crystalline sic and amorphous materials in nanocables .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the ir spectra of the nanocables synthesized at different flow ratios .",
    "the two strong absorption bands centered at @xmath101090 and @xmath10796@xmath1 in all spectra can be attributed to si - o antisymmetric stretching mode lwlin_2007 and sic transverse optical ( to ) mode wwang_2007 , hwshim_2007 , ksenthil_2008 , gfzou_2006 , respectively .",
    "therefore the amorphous material is confirmed to be @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note the change of sio main stretching band with ethanol flow . at low ethanol flow ,",
    "sio main stretching band shows a strong absorption peak centered at 1090@xmath1 and a weak shoulder centered at 1137@xmath1 . with increasing ethanol flow ,",
    "the intensity of 1090@xmath1 peak becomes weak , while 1137@xmath1 shoulder peak is enhanced . at high ethanol flow ,",
    "the two bands are clearly distinguished and the 1137@xmath1 peak becomes stronger .",
    "similar shoulder peaks centered at about 1130@xmath1 have been found from si-@xmath0 nanocables @xcite , amorphous @xmath0 nanowires lwlin_2007 and sic-@xmath0 nanocables alan_2007 .",
    "@xcite considered that this shoulder peak from si-@xmath0 nanocables resulted from the interface effect of the open structure of chainlike @xmath0/si nanowires and the vibration of an interstitial oxygen atom in a silicon single - crystalline core of nanowire . for @xmath0 nanowires @xcite , the origin of this shoulder peak",
    "was attributed to the structural disorder in amorphous @xmath0 .",
    "there was no explanation about this peak for sic-@xmath0 nanocables @xcite .",
    "in previous reports @xcite the origin of this shoulder peak was interpreted on the base of the experimental result of gaskell et al .",
    "we had also found the shoulder peak from sic-@xmath0 nanocables @xcite and attributed it to the interface effect of the open structure of chainlike @xmath0/sic nanocables and the vibration of interstitial oxygen atoms in a silicon carbide single - crystalline cores of nanocables on the base of prior reports @xcite .    however , our further study on the ir absorption property of sic-@xmath0 nanocables made us doubt with the attributions of 1130@xmath1 shoulder peak .",
    "for instant , the open structure did nt exist in @xmath0 nanowires showing intensive and sharp 1130@xmath1 shoulder peak @xcite .",
    "although the sharp 1130@xmath1 peak observed from @xmath0 nanowires having mean diameter of 100 nm @xcite but did nt appear from @xmath0 nanoparticles having diameters ranged 40 - 60 nm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 1130@xmath1 shoulder peak was disappeared after 5%hf etching for 2 min in spite of the existence of sic/@xmath0 interface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] with respect to the origin of 1130@xmath1 peak , we also believe the experimental result performed by gaskell et al . @xcite and refer it to the structural disorder in amorphous @xmath0 shells .",
    "the problem is why the structural disorder is created and where the structural disorder in @xmath0 exists . the sem , tem and eds measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) before and after etching obviously identify the removal of amorphous @xmath0 shell from nanocables during etching .",
    "these results and comparative analysis of prior reports imply that the structural disorder occurs near the surface of @xmath0 and its enhancement depends on the synthesis condition .",
    "the rough surface [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) ] implies the structural disorder of @xmath0 surface . at this time , it is not clear why the shortening of si - o bond occur in the surface of @xmath0 shell of sic-@xmath0 nanocable .",
    "it needs further study .",
    "next interest comes from a sharp band ranged from 870@xmath1 to 960 @xmath1 in fig .",
    "3 . at low ethanol flow ,",
    "an obvious peak centered at 910 @xmath1 comes into view . with increasing ethanol flow ,",
    "this peak becomes weak and finally a broad and weak absorption band appears in this region . to our knowledge , there is no report with respect to the sharp 910@xmath1 peak in sic-@xmath0 nanocables .",
    "this peak is difficult to be attributed to the terminal sioh deformation band absorption having its maximum position at 958@xmath1 lwlin_2007 due to the large frequency difference .",
    "moreover , this peak decreased with increasing ethanol flow .",
    "if we assign this peak to the oh group , the intensity of this band should be increased with increasing ethanol flow because more oh groups would be formed on the surface of @xmath0 shell at high ethanol concentration .",
    "this peak also differs from the sic if ( interface ) modes often observed in raman measurement yyan_2003 , because no dominant peak appears in this range from etched nanocables as shown in fig . 5 .",
    "to find out nature of the 910@xmath1 peak , we simulate infrared field in a sic nanorod inserted into a transparent host medium .",
    "absorption in the sic nanorod is calculated by @xmath11im@xmath12\\langle \\vec{e}^{2}\\rangle$ ] john_1999 , where @xmath13 signifies field - averaging over one optical cycle , i m signifies imaginary part , @xmath14 is the frequency of interest , @xmath15 is the infrared permittivity of sic at the frequency @xmath14 , @xmath16 is the displacement current density , and @xmath17 is the electric field strength .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) shows infrared absorption spectra for incident fields with the s- ( blue circle ) and p- ( red cross ) polarizations .",
    "for the s - polarization perpendicular to the cross section of sic nanorod , there is one peak near 795@xmath1 obviously corresponding to to - mode of sic , which is naturally observed in bulk sic . for the p - polarization parallel to the cross section of sic nanorod ,",
    "there is one peak between to - frequency and lo - frequency of sic .",
    "this peak is attributed to resonant coupling of p - polarized field to the nanostructure of sic , corresponding to surface phonon resonance ( spr ) in the sic nanorod . fig .",
    "[ fig:6](c ) shows field enhancement in the sic nanorod at the surface phonon resonance , while ( b ) shows no field enhancement at the to - frequency for the s - polarization .",
    "an analytical treatment of an ellipsoid in the electrostatic approximation craig_1983 can make nature of the two peaks more clear .",
    "the analytical study leads to the following expression for the polarizabilities @xmath18 along the principal axes ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is semiaxes of the ellipsoid , @xmath22 is the permittivity of host medium , @xmath23 is a geometrical factor given by @xmath24 @xmath25 the geometrical factors satisfy @xmath26 , and for a sphere @xmath27 . if the nanorod is considered as a kind of ellipsoid with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "if we remind the resonance arises at a pole of the polarizability , a surface - resonance peak ( @xmath31 ) centered between the to - frequency and the lo - frequency and no peak exactly centered at the to - frequency should be observed in ftir spectra of spherical nanoparticles of sic as were in sasaki_1989,gwmeng_2000 .",
    "however , for the case of nanorod , both of the surface - resonance peak ( @xmath32 ) between the to - frequency and the lo- frequency and the bulk - peak at the to - frequency ( @xmath33 ) should be observed as were clearly in our ftir spectra .",
    "our experimental result ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) shows weakening and disappearing of the 910@xmath1 band with increasing the flow of ethanol precursor , contrary to the theoretical deduction .",
    "it is assumed that the discrepancy is attributed to the highly disordered surface of @xmath0 shell and a transient layer between the @xmath0 shell and the sic core , which would be enhanced with increasing the flow of ethanol precursor , suppressing coupling of incident infrared field to the sic core .",
    "the enhancement of a peak centered at 1130@xmath1 at higher frequency of si - o stretching band was observed .",
    "the origin of this peak was referred to the structural disordering of @xmath0 shell surface .",
    "below 1000@xmath1 , our nanostructure reveals in its ftir spectra both of the peak centered at 910@xmath1 and the peak centered at 795@xmath1 .",
    "the 910@xmath1 peak is attributed to surface phonon resonance in the sic part which is characteristic of sic nanoparticles .",
    "the 795@xmath1 peak is attributed to to - mode absorption in the sic part , which is characteristic of bulk sic ."
