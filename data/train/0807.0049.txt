    "given the well established @xmath0-cluster structures of some excited states of @xmath3c , the low - lying isoscalar ( is ) excitations of @xmath3c become a subject of significant interest recently @xcite .",
    "in particular , the isoscalar 0@xmath4 state at 7.65 mev in @xmath3c ( known as the hoyle state ) has been studied extensively due to its vital role in the stellar synthesis of carbon .",
    "although this state was identified long ago in the inelastic scattering @xcite and inelastic electron scattering @xcite as an isoscalar @xmath5 excitation , our knowledge about its unique structure is still far from complete @xcite .",
    "since the hoyle state lies slightly above the @xmath0-decay threshold of 7.27 mev , its wave function turns out to have a dominant three @xmath0 clusters component , which has been confirmed , e.g. , by the resonating group method ( rgm ) calculations @xcite .",
    "quite interesting is the condensate structure suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite where the three @xmath0 clusters were shown to condense into the lowest @xmath6-state of their potential and form , therefore , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "such a bec structure of the hoyle state was shown @xcite to be mixed also with the molecular @xmath7be@xmath8 configuration .    in general , to validate conclusion made in the structure calculation",
    ", the wave functions must be carefully tested in the study of nuclear reactions .",
    "since the spin- and isospin zero @xmath0-particle is a very good projectile to excite the nuclear is states , the 3-@xmath0 rgm wave function of the hoyle state obtained by kamimura @xcite has been recently used in a folding model analysis @xcite of the inelastic scattering and realistic @xmath5 transition was deduced . in the present work",
    "we extend this approach to study also other is excitations of @xmath3c like 2@xmath1 ( 4.44 mev ) , 3@xmath2 ( 9.64 mev ) , 0@xmath1 ( 10.3 mev ) and 1@xmath2 ( 10.84 mev ) states , using the rgm wave functions @xcite .",
    "in general , the form factor ( ff ) contains all structure information of the nuclear state and it is , therefore , desirable to have ff evaluated in the microscopic folding model using an appropriate effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction and realistic wave functions for the @xmath0-particle and target nucleus , respectively .",
    "the main ingredients of the folding approach and coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism for elastic and inelastic scattering can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the _ complex _ density dependent cdjlm interaction constructed @xcite based on the brueckner hartree - fock results for the nucleon optical potential ( op ) in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the nuclear wave functions obtained in the rgm method by kamimura @xcite have been used to generate nuclear densities for the folding calculation of the complex op and transition ff for the system .",
    "these rgm wave functions were proven to give consistently a realistic description of the compact structure of the ground state @xmath9 and the first @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , as well as the dilute structure of the @xmath12 ( hoyle state ) and 1@xmath2 state ( see table  1 ) .",
    "@xmath13 in @xmath14  @xmath15 for 0@xmath1 and 1@xmath2 states .",
    "[ t1 ]    for the hoyle state , the rgm wave function has been shown @xcite to be very close to the bec wave function . to take into account coupling between different scattering channels ,",
    "the rgm densities were constructed for both the diagonal and nondiagonal transitions between states under study , including the @xmath16 reorientation of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and 1@xmath2 states . in total , 23 diagonal and nondiagonal densities were used to calculate the op and inelastic ff for the cc equations , with the coupling scheme shown in fig .  1",
    ".        [ f1 ]    one can see from fig .  1 that the two - step excitation of the is states are treated in equal footing with the direct excitation .",
    "in particular , the two - step excitation ( @xmath17 ) of the hoyle state is the exact inverse of transitions taking place in the stellar carbon production .",
    "since the @xmath18 transition strengths for some states are well determined from experiment , we have slightly scaled the rgm densities to match the calculated @xmath19 values with the data for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so that the corresponding inelastic ff can be reliably used in the cc analysis of the inelastic scattering . for the @xmath12 and @xmath22 states ,",
    "given a good description @xcite of the @xmath23 data by the corresponding rgm transition densities , we kept them unchanged in the folding calculation .",
    "all the cc calculations have been performed using the code ecis97 written by raynal @xcite .",
    "although many experiments on inelastic scattering were done ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) in the last century , inelastic scattering to the @xmath24 ( 10.3 mev ) and 1@xmath2 ( 10.8 mev ) states have been measured with high precision only recently at the @xmath0 energy of 240 mev @xcite .",
    "we concentrate , therefore , on the 240 mev data in the present work . to fine tune",
    "the strength of complex cdjlm interaction , the real and imaginary elastic folded potentials were slightly renormalized by an optimal fit to the elastic scattering data .",
    "the same renormalization factors were then used to scale the real and imaginary inelastic folded ff for the inelastic scattering study     mev @xcite for the is states of @xmath3c under study in comparison with the dwba and cc results obtained with the folded op and inelastic ff .",
    "the transition momenta ( or probabilities ) and fractions of the ewsr are deduced from the renormalized dwba calculation . ]",
    "[ f2 ]    either in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) or in one- and two - step cc schemes .",
    "the dwba and cc results are compared with the data in fig",
    ".  2 . except for the @xmath10 state , the calculated cross sections for other states significantly overestimate the data , especially for the @xmath24 and 1@xmath2 states . the cc effect by one- and two - step coupling could not help to solve this problem . to fit the data in the conventional dwba or cc methods",
    ", the complex inelastic ff needs to be scaled by a factor @xmath25 ( see table  1 and the renormalized dwba results plotted in fig .  2 ) .",
    "since the rgm transition densities were used to reproduce quite well the experimental @xmath23 form factors of these states @xcite , such a scaling leads naturally to a  suppression \" of the is transition strength , in terms of @xmath19 probability or fraction of is energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) shown in fig .",
    "2 . it can be seen from table  1 that the is strengths deduced from the renormalized dwba results strongly disagree with the experimental values .",
    "for example , the renormalized dwba implies about 6.9% of the is monopole ewsr for the hoyle state , while this fraction should be around 15% as deduced from the @xmath23 data @xcite . since the @xmath23 data measured by strehl @xcite covers only low momentum transfers , we compare in fig .  3 the @xmath23 form factors for the hoyle state given by the rgm transition density with a set of high precision @xmath23 data taken up to high momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "data at low momentum transfers @xcite ) and 6.9% ( as deduced from the renormalized dwba ) of the monopole ewsr .",
    "the data are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite . ]    [ f3 ]        [ f4 ]    it is easy to deduce from fig .  3 that the @xmath5 transition strength of the hoyle state exhausts 15 - 23 % of the is monopole ewsr , more than twice the sum rule fraction found from the conventional dwba analysis of inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "we have found @xcite that an enhanced absorption in the exit channel ( due to the short lifetime and weakly bound structure of the hoyle state ) leads directly to a suppression the monopole strength in the inelastic scattering . to explore similar effect for other is states of @xmath3c , we have added to the microscopic folded imaginary op for each exit channel a surface term @xmath26 with parameters determined from the best dwba and cc fit to the inelastic data . in this way",
    ", consistent descriptions of the inelastic scattering and @xmath23 data could be reached using the rgm nuclear transition densities ( see fig .  4 ) . excepting for the @xmath10 state , the imaginary op in the exit channel turned out , as expected , to be much stronger than that in the entrance @xmath27c@xmath28 channel ( see the ratio @xmath29 of the volume integral of the imaginary op in the exit channel to that in the entrance channel in table  1 ) . by comparing the nuclear rms radii , mean lifetimes @xmath30 and ratios @xmath29 for the is states of @xmath3c under study ,",
    "we conclude that there exists a correlation between the diluteness , lifetime ( or weak binding ) of the excited state and absorption in the exit channel .",
    "since most of the candidates for @xmath0-cluster states are weakly bound , this absorption effect must be taken into account in the future studies of cluster states excited in the inelastic or scattering .",
