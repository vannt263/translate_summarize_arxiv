    "many of us remember that fabulous excitement that reigned in physics world after the discovery of high-@xmath1 cuprates . since then , we have become so familiar with record - breaking temperatures of 90 k , 120 k , 160 k , that it is worth recalling that 15 years ago not only the highest known superconducting temperature was meager 24 k , but it was also believed by many since early 70 s @xcite that this temperature is close to the theoretical limit for electron - phonon superconductivity .",
    "high-@xmath1 superconductivity revolutionized our approaches both to theory and to experiment .",
    "however , in the shadow of mysterious cuprates lower - temperature superconductors were receiving relatively little attention .",
    "this has been changed recently . in 2001 alone , besides the report of 40 k superconductivity in the simple magnesium diboride , exciting cases of superconductivity coexisting with magnetism ( zrzn@xmath0 ) , possibly induced by magnetism ( @xmath2-fe ) , or competing with magnetism ( mgcni@xmath3 ) were reported .",
    "while all these cases are different and probably manifest quite different physics , all of them indicate that the physics community turned its face back to low - temperature superconductivity . and , of course , mgb@xmath0 is the champion of the year , hands down .    very similar to the high-@xmath1 cuprates ,",
    "immediately after its discovery@xcite some authors described mgb@xmath0 as an extreme case of conventional , `` eliashberg '' superconductivity , an extremely lucky combination of the fortunate parameters@xcite , while the others suggested variety of exotic electronic mechanisms , possibly similar to cuprateshirsch , rice , baskaran , yamaji , marsiglio .",
    "but the analogy stops here .",
    "now , two years after the discovery , we already have much better understanding and much more universal consensus about the physics of mgb@xmath0 , than about cuprates .",
    "in fact , an agreement emerges that it is , albeit still an electron - phonon superconductor , a case of genuinely novel physics , sufficiently unusual to set it apart from all previous electron - phonon superconductors@xcite .",
    "one of the main factors that distinguishes mgb@xmath0 from the high-@xmath1 cuprates is that the electronic structure of this materials is very well described by conventional band - theoretical methods , which have been perfected in the last decades to the level that allows unprecedentally detailed first - principle calculations of electron and phonon spectra , and of the electron - phonon calculations .",
    "excellent agreement of such _ ab initio _ calculations with the experiment literally leaves hardly any room to play with exotic , but hardly verifiable models , so popular in the high-@xmath1 world . in this chapter",
    "we will try to present a broad view on the physics of mgb@xmath0 , as it currently emerges from the first - principle calculation , and seems to be fully supported by the experiment .",
    "the chapter is organized as follows : the electronic structure of bulk mgb@xmath4 is disussed in section 2 , which also deals with some experiments that give credit to the calculated band structure . in section 3",
    "we discuss first principles calculations of the phonon spectra and the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion of multiband effects in mgb@xmath5",
    "mgb@xmath6 occurs in the alb@xmath6 structure .",
    "boron atoms reside in graphite - like ( honeycomb ) layers stacked with no displacement  @xcite forming hexagonal prisms with the base translation almost equal to the height , @xmath7 ( 3.009 )   and @xmath8 ( 1.084 ) for mgb@xmath6 ( alb@xmath9 ) .",
    "these prisms contain large , nearly spherical pores occupied by mg atoms .",
    "this structure may therefore be regarded as that of completely intercalated graphite  @xcite with carbon replaced by boron , its neighbor in the periodic table .",
    "furthermore , mgb@xmath6 is formally isoelectronic to graphite .",
    "therefore , chemical bonding and electronic properties of mgb@xmath6 are expected to have some similarity to those of graphite and graphite intercalation compounds , some of which also exhibit superconductivity . as in graphite ( @xmath10=1.42   ) , the intralayer b ",
    "b bonds are much shorter than the interlayer distance , and hence the b ",
    "b bonding is strongly anisotropic .",
    "however , the intralayer bonds are only twice as short as the interlayer ones , compared to the ratio of 2.4 in graphite , allowing for a significant interlayer hopping . for comparison ,",
    "the interatomic distance between nearest neighbors is 1.55    in diamond and 1.41.45    in the c@xmath11 molecule .    in spite of a structural similarity to intercalated graphite and , to some extent , to doped fullerenes , mgb@xmath0 has a qualitatively different and rather uncommon structure of the conducting states setting it aside from both these groups of superconductors .",
    "the peculiar and ( so far ) unique feature of mgb@xmath0 is the incomplete filling of the two @xmath12 bands corresponding to strongly covalent , @xmath13-hybrid bonding within the graphite - like boron layer .",
    "the holes at the top of these @xmath12 bands manifest notably two - dimensional properties and are localized within the boron sheets , in contrast with mostly three - dimensional electrons and holes in the @xmath14 bands , which are delocalized over the whole crystal .",
    "these 2d covalent and 3d metallic - type states contribute almost equally to the total density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , while the unfilled covalent bands experience strong interaction with longitudinal vibrations in the boron layer .",
    "the band structure of mgb@xmath6 had been reported long before the discovery of superconductivity @xcite and is now known in very detail .",
    "the results discussed in this chapter were obtained using lmto - asa , full - potential lmto , or full - potential lapw method .",
    "computational details may be found in respective original publications . for mgb@xmath6 , there is usually little difference between different methods , in any event , none important for the qualitative discussions in this chapter .",
    "the energy bands , dos and the fermi surface of mgb@xmath6 are shown in figs .",
    "[ mgb2bnds ] ,  [ dos ] and  [ fermisurfaces ] .",
    "as expected , the bands are quite similar to those of graphite with three bonding @xmath15 bands corresponding to in - plane @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) hybridization in the boron layer and two @xmath18 bands ( bonding and antibonding ) formed by aromatically hybridized boron @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath14 bands have strong in - plane dispersion due to the large overlap between all @xmath20 orbitals ( both in - plane and out - of - plane ) for neighboring boron atoms .",
    "the interlayer overlaps are much smaller , especially for @xmath21 orbitals , so that the @xmath22 dispersion of @xmath15 bands does not exceed 1  ev . on the other hand , in contrast to intercalated graphites ,",
    "two of the @xmath15 bands are filled incompletely .",
    "together with weak @xmath22 dispersion this results in the appearance of two nearly cylindrical sheets of the fermi surface ( see fig .  [ fermisurfaces ] ) around the @xmath23a line .",
    "as we will see below from the analysis of the charge density distribution , these unfilled @xmath15 bands with boron @xmath21 character fully retain their covalent structure .",
    "conducting covalent bonds represent a peculiar feature of mgb@xmath6 making it an exotic compound probably existing on the brink of structural instability .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fermisurfaces ] that the @xmath14 bands form two planar honeycomb tubular networks : an antibonding electron - type sheet centered at @xmath24 ( red ) and a similar , but more compact , bonding hole - type sheet centered at @xmath25 ( blue ) .",
    "these two sheets touch at some point on the k - h line .",
    "the hole - type sheet is close to an electronic topological transition ( ett ) at the m point corresponding to the breakdown of the tubular network into separate starfish - like pockets ( at 0.25  ev above @xmath26 ) .    in order to examine the relation between the band structure of mgb@xmath6and that of graphite in more detail one can compare the following hypothetical sequence of intermediate materials : carbon in the ` primitive graphite ' ( pg ) lattice with no displacement between layers as in mgb@xmath6 , using graphite lattice parameters ; boron in the pg lattice with @xmath27  as in mgb@xmath6  and @xmath28 as in graphite ; boron in the pg lattice with @xmath27  and @xmath29  as in mgb@xmath6 ; lib@xmath6 in the same structure ; mgb@xmath6  itself",
    ". the results of some of these calculations @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ manybands ] .    the band structure of pg carbon shown in fig .",
    "[ manybands]a is very similar to that of graphite  @xcite with the appropriate zone - folding for a smaller unit cell .",
    "( this is quite natural because of the weak interlayer interaction . )",
    "boron in the same lattice ( not shown ) has nearly identical bands with the energies scaled by the inverse square of the lattice parameter , in agreement with canonical tight - binding scalingharrison .",
    "[ manybands]b shows the natural enhancement of the out - of - plane dispersion of the @xmath18 bands when the interlayer distance is reduced . figs .",
    "[ manybands]c and [ manybands]d demonstrate that ` intercalation ' of boron by li or mg produces a significant distortion of the band structure , so that the role of the intercalant is not simply donating electrons to boron s bands ( which would recover the band structure of pg carbon shown in fig .",
    "[ manybands]a ) .",
    "the main change upon intercalation is the downward shift of the @xmath18 bands compared to @xmath15 bands . for li",
    "this shift of @xmath301.5 ev is almost uniform throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "replacement of li by mg shifts the @xmath18 bands further , but this shift is strongly asymmetric increasing from @xmath300.6 ev at the @xmath31 point to @xmath30 2.6 ev at the a point . in addition , the out - of - plane dispersion of the @xmath15 bands is also significantly enhanced . in lib@xmath32",
    "the filling of the bonding @xmath21 bands is nearly the same as in pg boron , while in mgb@xmath6 the fermi level shifts closer to the top of these bands .",
    "the lowering of the @xmath14 bands in mgb@xmath6 compared to pg boron is due to stronger interaction of boron @xmath19 orbitals with ionized magnesium sublattice compared to @xmath21 orbitals .",
    "this lowering is greater at the ahl plane compared to the @xmath23 km plane , because the antisymmetric ( with @xmath25 ) overlap of the boron s @xmath19 tails increases the electronic density close to the magnesium plane where its attractive potential is the strongest .",
    "the nature of bonding in mgb@xmath6 may be understood from the charge density ( cd ) plots@xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ charge ] . as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ charge]a , bonding in the boron layer is typically covalent .",
    "the cd of the boron atom is strongly aspherical , and the directional bonds with high cd are clearly seen ( see also ref .",
    "the cd distribution in the boron layer is very similar to that in the carbon layer of graphite  freeman .",
    "this directional in - plane bonding is also obvious from fig .",
    "chargeb showing the cd in the cross section containing both mg and b atoms .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ charge]b also shows that a large amount of valence charge does not participate in any covalent bonding , but is rather distributed more or less homogeneously over the whole crystal .",
    "further , fig .",
    "[ charge]c shows the difference of the cd of mgb@xmath6  and that of hypothetical nab@xmath6  in exactly the same lattice .",
    "not only does it show that one extra valence electron is not absorbed by boron atoms but that it is rather delocalized in the interstitials ; it also shows that some charge moves away from the boron atoms and covalent in - plane b - b bonds .",
    "charged shows the cd difference between the isoelectronic compounds mgb@xmath9  and pg carbon ( c@xmath6 ) . in mgb@xmath6 ,",
    "the electrons see approximately the same external potential as in c@xmath6 , except that one proton is pulled from each c nucleus and put at the mg site .",
    "it is evident that the change c@xmath6@xmath33mgb@xmath6 weakens the two - center @xmath34  bonds ( the charge between the atoms is depleted ) and redistributes it into a delocalized , metallic density .",
    "a numerical reconstruction of the electronic charge density from the synchrotron radiation data for a powder mgb@xmath0 sample  @xcite supports this general picture .",
    "the charge density found for 15  k is , in fact , very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ charge]b and shows all the important features discussed above including the distinct covalent bonds within the boron sheets , the strongly ionized mg , and the delocalized charges in the interstitials .",
    "further , the fourier maps obtained  @xcite for the single crystals also clearly show the covalent @xmath17 hybrids in the boron layer and no covalent bonding between b and mg atoms .",
    "thus , one can say that mgb@xmath0 is held together by strongly _",
    "bonds within boron layers and by delocalized , ` _ metallic_-type ' bonds between these sheets .",
    "a peculiar feature of this compound is that electrons participating in both of these bond types provide comparable contributions to @xmath35 .",
    "this distinguishes mgb@xmath0 from closely related graphites where covalent bonds in the carbon layers are always completely filled , while the nearly cylindrical parts of the fermi surface commonly found in those compounds are formed by carbon - derived @xmath14 bands which are much less 3d that the corresponding bands in mgb@xmath0@xcite .    because of the coexistence of two different types of conducting states , one needs to see the contributions to the total dos and transport properties from separate sheets of the fermi surface originating from 2d covalent and 3d metallic - type bonding .",
    "this decomposition is shown in fig .  [ dos ] for the dos and in fig .",
    "[ vel ] for the in - plane ( @xmath36 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath37 ) components of the plasma frequency @xmath38d{\\bf k% } $ ] , where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-component of the fermi velocity .",
    "the 3d ( metallic - type bonding ) and cylindrical ( covalent bonding ) parts of the fermi surface contribute , respectively , about 58% and 42% to @xmath41 . if the @xmath12 fermi surfaces were ideal cylinders , @xmath42 for these bands would have a step - like singularity at some 0.5 ev above @xmath43",
    "this is broadened by a nonzero @xmath44-dispersion .",
    "the hole @xmath14-band has a 3d van hove singularity in the same range of energies , while the electron - like @xmath14-band has a dos which is rather flat around @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath14-bands contribute about 80% to the total @xmath45 , and thus , given the same relaxation rate for all bands , to total conductivity . while the total conductivity is more or less isotropic , the @xmath46band conductivity is , as expected , highly anisotropic .",
    "it is well known that in some materials conventional band structure calculations do not reproduce the exterimental one - electron excitation spectra with sufficient accuracy .",
    "these case usually involve strongly correlated materials ( cuprates , heavy fermions , etc ) with localized @xmath47- or @xmath48electrons . on the first glance",
    ", mgb@xmath0 does not seem to belong to any of such classes .",
    "however , it was important to verify experimentally how reliable are lda calculations in this compound .",
    "one of the most popular experimental probes of electronic band structure is angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , particularly in view of remarkable progress achieved in the last decade . in spite of the fact that arpes probes only a very thin surface layer and is therefore not always representative of the bulk electronic structure , first experimentsarpes show an exceptional agreement between the theory and the experiment in the whole studied energy range .",
    "both @xmath15 bands and @xmath18 band were observed along the @xmath49 direction , as predicted by the calculations . along",
    "@xmath50 direction only one out of the two predicted @xmath15 bands was observed ; the authors speculated that the single experimental feature in this region may result from the superposition of the two bands . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the band in question has different symmetry along the two measured directions may contribute to the selection rules .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the electronic states centered around the @xmath23 point revealed that this feature originated from a surface electronic state , which is in good overall agreement between apres and theoretical results for the mg - terminated surface@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , surfaces with partial mg coverage , say , 50% , were not studied theoretically , although this is the most likely termination .",
    "possibly even better agreement can be achieved if such termination will be included in the calculations .",
    "a classical probe of the fermi surface properties are quantum oscillations , _",
    "e.g. , _ de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect .",
    "such measurements have been reported @xcite .",
    "three dhva frequencies were clearly resolved in data from ref.@xcite , corresponding to two distinct sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "a comparison of the calculated frequenciesharima , rosner , mazdhva with the experimental data shows excellent agreement .",
    "the discrepancies with the theory are less than 300 t which is only 0.2% of the area of the hexagonal bz . the detailed angular dependence of f@xmath51 , f@xmath9 and f@xmath52 has been calculated in ref.@xcite and compares favorably with the experimental results .",
    "the ratio of experimental and theoretical effective masses provides mass renormalization , presumably of electron - phonon origin , which appears to be 1.08 - 1.2 for the inner @xmath12 cylinder and 0.40 for the @xmath14 sheet .",
    "this is to be compared with the calculated numbers of 1.25@xcite , 1.57@xcite , @xmath531.1 @xcite , and 0.47@xcite , 0.50@xcite , @xmath530.33 @xcite ; a rather good agreement .",
    "overall , arpes and dhva experiments , taken together , fully support lda calculations , leaving hardly any room for many body renormalization of the band masses and velocities , apart from the epc renormalization .",
    "it is worth noting that for the @xmath14 orbit it was possible to estimate the local stoner enhancement factor .",
    "it appears that lda calculations underestimate the exchange splitting induced by a magnetic field by about 50% .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear yet .",
    "on the other hand , electron spin resonance measurements@xcite found electronic spin susceptibility of @xmath54emu / mole , corresponding to a stoner renormalization of 50% _ less _ than calculatednmrantrop , nmreva .",
    "since both arpes and dhva spectroscopy in mgb@xmath0 are described in detail in other chapters of this book , we shall refer the reader to those , and will concentrate in the following on another probe of the electronic structure near the fermi level , namely nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "nmr spectroscopy measures two electronic structure related quantities , the knight shift , @xmath55 , and the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath56 .",
    "the former is related to the uniform spin susceptibility , the latter to the local susceptibility at a nucleus .",
    "both are linked to the dos at the fermi level , but in an indirect way involving hyperfine interactions . therefore extracting reliable information about",
    "the electronic structure is usually possible only if the corresponding calculations of the hyperfine field are available .    for mgb@xmath0 , this is the case .",
    "several experimental groups reported @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 for the b site @xcite , which is of particular interest because of the role that b states play in superconductivity .",
    "two groups reported first principles calculations for @xmath58 @xcite and for @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "importantly , it appears that nmr in mgb@xmath0 not only probes b electrons , but it also probes differently @xmath12 and @xmath14 bands .",
    "indeed , since @xmath12 bands are formed by the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states , they can form @xmath61 combinations , which have nonzero orbital moment .",
    "one can therefore expect considerable orbital contribution to the relaxation rate .",
    "indeed , calculations show @xcite that the orbital mechanism dominates over the two others , the fermi - contact and the spin - dipolar , mechanisms in the spin - lattice relaxation . on the contrary , for the mg nucleus",
    "the dominant relaxation mechanism is , as usually , the fermi - contact interaction , which also dominates the b and mg knight shift@xcite .    the results of the calculations agree well with the experiment .",
    "the experimental numbers for @xmath56 on @xmath62b are in a range of @xmath63k@xmath64sec ) .",
    "calculations using bare susceptibility produce numbers of 5.1@xmath6510@xmath66/(k@xmath64sec)nmrantrop and 3.7@xmath6510@xmath66/(k@xmath64sec)@xcite .",
    "this numbers are subject to many body renormalization .",
    "renormalized values involve additional assumptions ; in ref.@xcite the renormalized relaxation rate was estimated to be 8.1@xmath67/(k@xmath64sec ) , while ref.nmreva gives a range of(4.3 - 5.9 ) @xmath6510@xmath66/(k@xmath64sec ) . as regards the knight shift , unfortunately , the spread of the experimentally obtained values is still too large to allow for a quantitative comparison with the calculations .",
    "as mentioned above , the nmr relaxation rate is very sensitive to the relative amount of @xmath12 and @xmath14 states , which implies a nontrivial dependence on the filling of the @xmath12 bands .",
    "this was indeed calculated in ref.@xcite for mgb@xmath0 doped with al ( whose primary effect is to fill @xmath12 hole states ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "the theoretically predicted in ref.@xcite tendencies were experimentally verified for the entire mg@xmath68al@xmath69b@xmath6 system of alloys .",
    "very impressive agreement was obtained ( fig.[nmr ] ) .",
    "standard description of the epc in metals is sometimes referred to as the migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "we are not going to review this theory here , as it can be found in many excellent texts , but will briefly remind the basic formulas of this theory .",
    "the primary notion of this formalism is that of the linear epc vertex , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the derivative of the crystal potential with respect to the normal phonon coordinate .",
    "@xmath72 stand for the electron wave vectors , and @xmath73 for the wave vector and the mode index of the phonon whose interaction with the electrons is being described . in other words , @xmath74 is the probability of an electron to be scattered from the state @xmath75 into the state latexmath:[$%    theorem ( which holds for mgb@xmath0 ) states that this vertex is not renormalized by higher order processes .",
    "it does not state , however , as discussed below , that anharmonic corrections to the phonon spectra or nonlinear vertices like @xmath77 are necessaruly negligible .",
    "@xmath78 , if properly integrated over all possible virtual electron - hole pairs , defines the phonon self energy . in particular , its imaginary part , the phonon linewidth ,",
    "is given by @xmath79 in this formula , the right - hand side does not explicitely depend on @xmath80 ( the prefactor cancels the corresponding factor in @xmath81 .",
    "sometimes a related quantity , the epc constant for a given mode , is used : @xmath82 .",
    "one may note that this quantity is strictly zero for optical zone center ( @xmath83 ) phonons ; however , a related constant can be introduced , @xmath84\\sum_{{\\bf k}}|g_{{\\bf k , k},\\nu } |^{2},$ ] and @xmath85 is obviously related to the deformation potential .",
    "when integrated over all phonon modes and corresponding intermediate electron states , @xmath78 defines the electron self - energy , or mass renormalization @xmath86 : @xmath87    finally , when integrated over all phonons with given frequency and over electronic states at the fermi level , it defines the epc spectral function , which determines superconducting properties of a single - gap superconductor , @xmath88which can be broken into @xmath89 matrix separating the interband pairing interaction from the intraband one @xmath90where @xmath91 label different electronic bands or group of bands , @xmath92 @xmath93 .    2      in the first publication  @xcite following the discovery of sc in mgb@xmath94 the strength of the epc was estimated and it was suggested that mgb@xmath0 is a standard bcs superconductor , where coupling with the b phonons is the driving force for superconductivity .",
    "a substantial b , but small mg isotope effects were predicted .",
    "both predictions were confirmed by the experiment@xcite .",
    "the relevant phonons were soon identified in ref.@xcite as two optical @xmath95 modes , which was confirmed by subsequent full - scale calculations of epc .    because of pronounced dissimilarity between different electron groups and different phonon modes it is unavoidable for understanding superconductivity in mgb@xmath6 to calculate epc spectral function @xmath96 including all bands and all phonons on the same footing . by now ,",
    "at least four groups have claimed to have done this from the first principlesliu , kong , choi , bohnen .",
    "three of these @xcite were based on pseudopotential band structure calculations ; one @xcite utilized a full - potential lmto method .",
    "three used the linear response formalism to compute phonon spectra and electron - phonon matrix elements@xcite ; one@xcite was based on frozen phonon calculations at several high - symmetry point with a subsequent interpolation onto a finer mesh .",
    "the last work also used an anharmonic correction to the phonon frequencies , which the other three works did not include ( ref.@xcite provided a rough estimate of the effect ) .",
    "the results are compared in table [ phon ] , and the @xmath95 frequencies are compared with selected frozen phonon calculations .",
    "the last two columns in table [ phon ] show _ isotropic _ , or thermodynamic epc constant ; as discussed later , it is probably not directly relevant to superconductivity , but it defines the average electronic mass renormalization , and thus the renormalization of specific heat .",
    "the latest exteriments@xcite ( the latter two on single crystals ) , reported for the electronic specific heat coeffiient the values of @xmath972.5 , 2.3 , and 3.5 mj / mole@xmath98k@xmath99 , respectively ( the discrepancy may be partially related to different temperature ranges used in fitting ) .",
    "the unrenormalized dos ( table [ phon ] ) corresponds to @xmath971.67 mj / mole@xmath98k@xmath99 , yielding @xmath100 from 0.4 to 1.1 . while clearly inconclusive , these numbers are equally consistent with all entries in the table [ phon ] .",

    "the mass renormalization parameters for each band can be constructed from the matrix @xmath103 : @xmath104 these @xmath105 define , among other things , the de haas - van alphen thermal masses .",
    "finally , the renormalization of the specific heat is given by the weighted average of @xmath106 @xmath107 which is also the `` eliashberg '' coupling constant determining the superconductivity in the isotropic limit , where all order parameters are constrained to be the same .",
    "one can show that @xmath108 the equality being achieved when and only when all elements of the @xmath109 matrix are the same ( the relative magnitude of @xmath110 is irrelevant ) . physically",
    "this result is obvious : the bcs theory can be formulated as a variational theory .",
    "therefore a bigger energy gain , and a higher critical temperature , can be achieved if more variational freedom is provided , @xmath92 by allowing different order parameters in the different bands .      in this section",
    "we will ouline nontrivial effects related to impurity scattering in a multigap superconductor .",
    "the discussion will mostly follow ref.@xcite , where more details can be found . in the born approximation , and close to @xmath111 the problem",
    "can be solved analytically .",
    "it appears that nonmagnetic impurities suppress superconductivity in much the same way , as magnetic ones do in a regular superconductor , however , only the _ inter_band impurity scattering has a pair - breaking effect . in the weak nonmagnetic scattering limit , for two bands ,",
    "the @xmath112 suppression is@xmath113where @xmath114 is the interband scatering rate .",
    "note that the @xmath112 suppression is linear in @xmath115 this formula also gives us a clue about what is a weak and what is a sttrong scattering in the specific case of mgb@xmath116 small scattering is when @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the variation of the gap between the bands , and @xmath119 is the average gap .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath120 and the @xmath121 band gaps is , experimentally and theoretically , of the order of 3 .",
    "the densities of states are comparable .",
    "therefore a @xmath112 suppression of 1 k would require an interband scattering rate of the order of 1 mev .",
    "it is a fortunate and rather unexpected coincidence that the symmetry of the electronic states conspire in such a way as to make the interband scattering rate quite small even in rather dirty samples@xcite . only because of this conspiracy we are actually able to observe two distinctive gaps in this compound .    on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of the gap within each of the two band systems , calculated in ref.@xcite , which is of the order of 7% , can not survive a @xmath122 impurity or phonon scattering stronger than @xmath123 mev , and therefore is unobservable in samples of any imaginable quality .    in the strong interband scattering limit a complete isotropization of all fermi surfaces takes place .",
    "this limit is achieved@xcite when the interband scattering rate becomes larger than the relevant phonon frequency , in our case , 600 @xmath124 mev .",
    "then the two gaps merge to one , the isotropic bcs gap , and the critical temperature drops to it isotropic value .",
    "strong coupling calculations of ref.@xcite predict the latter to be around 19 k. indeed , recent experiments on irradiated samples@xcite demonstrated a reduction of the gap ratio by 40% , accompanied by a @xmath112 reduction by 22% .",
    "one should note , however , that the results of ref.junod-irr , while qualitatively consistent with the prediction of the two - band model , quantitatively do not agree with them .",
    "similar results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to extend the theory of multiband superconductivity beyond the weak coupling bcs model@xcite .",
    "qualitatively one can easily understand the main effect of the strong coupling by recalling the mcmillan equation:@xmath125 .\\]]qualitatively , this equation can be understood as renormalized bcs equation , @xmath126 , $ ] where @xmath127 and the mass renormalization has been applied to @xmath128 , @xmath129 we already know that the multiband version of the bcs equation differs from this in that @xmath130 is substituted by an effective @xmath131 the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath132 the effect of coulomb repulsion , introduced in the bcs model @xmath133 the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath134 is likewise introduced in its multiband version @xmath133 the _ matrix _ @xmath135 .",
    "the multiband analog of the mcmillan equation is , therefore , @xmath136 , \\]]where @xmath137 is defined as the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix@xmath138this expression gives the results very close to the full solution of the multiband eliashberg equations .",
    "the coulomb pseudopotential matrix is not a constant , as it is sometimes believed@xcite .",
    "first of all , already the _ bare _ pseudopotential matrix , @xmath139 is not uniform .",
    "indeed , it is formally defined as @xmath140 ( where @xmath141 is the screened coulomb interaction , and the averaging is over the corresponding fermi surfaces ) , and as had been noticed , for instance , by agtergerg _",
    "et al _ in another compound@xcite , when different bands have different orbital character , the coulomb matrix elements between these bands are suppressed compared to intraband matrix elements . jepsen and andersen@xcite estimated this effect , using the tight - binding lmto method and found the ratio between @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 to be @xmath1453:2.5:1 .",
    "furhermore , any anisotropy in _ bare _ pseudopotential is further enhanced in the renormalized @xmath146 in the one - band case @xmath147 is renormalized as @xmath148,$ ] where @xmath149 is a characteristic electronic frequency ( of the order of the bandwidth or plasma frequency ) .",
    "for a multiband case we have a matrix equation , which is a natural extension of the standard procedure@xcite @xmath150it is easy to show that renormalization enhances any nonuniformity in @xmath151 indeed , assuming @xmath152 , ( @xmath153 , and @xmath154 we obtain @xmath155 from the ratios of @xmath156 s above , @xmath157 and @xmath158 for mgb@xmath6 is of the order of 0.5 - 1 , so for @xmath159 it holds that @xmath160    the fact that the matrix @xmath159 is approximately diagonal is of utmost importance .",
    "various calculations @xcite differ in details , but all agree that the interband electron - phonon coupling constant is 0.15 - 0.2 .",
    "since the order parameter in the @xmath18 band is induced by the @xmath34 band ( except for the very low temperature ) , if a coulomb repulsion offsets most of the interband coupling , the induced gap becomes vanishingly small .",
    "if @xmath161 were of the order of @xmath162 the gap ratio @xmath163 would be much larger than the observed ratio of approximately 3 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is in direct contradiction with a popular misconception that the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath6 are not very sensitive to @xmath164@xcite ; they are not only in the one - band picture . to demonstrate this",
    ", we performedcomment2 2x2 eliashberg calculations using the electron - phonon interaction from ref . @xcite .",
    "although the authors of ref.@xcite do not break down their results for the electron - phonon coupling in a 2-band form , which would have made them easier to analyze , one can find the 2x2 matrix corresponding to their calculations by integrating the @xmath165 distribution depicted in their graphs ( table [ lam ] ) .",
    "it appeared that with @xmath166=0.12 , used in refs.@xcite , the ratio @xmath163 at zero temperature is 4.3 and the critical temperature @xmath167 k. on the other hand , calculations with a _",
    "diagonal _ matrix , @xmath168 @xmath169 produced @xmath170 k and @xmath171_. _      a closer look at normal transport in mgb@xmath0 reveals several phenomena which are hard to understand .",
    "first , there is a severe violation of the matthiessen rule : samples with large residual resistivity tend to have much stronger temperature dependence of the resistivity than `` clean '' samples .",
    "second , optical conductivity does not seem to obey the drude - lorenz law ; if one attempts a drude - lorenz fit to experimental spectra , the extracted plasma frequency is 5 times smaller than expected .",
    "many researchers believe that these problems are due to extrinsic effects like grain boundaries .",
    "while future experiments will clarify this matter , it interesting to observe that multiband effects can actually explain such observations rather easily .",
    "the theory of multiband effects in electric transport has been developed by allen and co - workers@xcite .",
    "one important qualitative statement can be made upfront : since the kinetic equation in a metal can be solved variationally with respect to the electric conductivity , giving a variational freedom for different bands to change their distribution functions separately should always result in an increase of the conductivity .",
    "in other words , while in the one - band theory the superconducting , the thermodynamic , and the transport ppc constants are usually similar ( the first two being identical ) , in the multiband theory the former is always larger than in the corresponding one - band scenario , and the latter is always smaller .",
    "quantitatively , one can write down the following formulas:@xmath172 [ \\sum_{{\\bf k } } v_{j{\\bf k}}^{2}\\delta ( \\varepsilon _ { j{\\bf k}% } ) ] \\\\",
    "t_{ij } & = & t_{ij}^{out}-t_{ij}^{in } \\\\ & = & \\delta _",

    "the physical meaning of these formulas is just that of the parallel conductors formula , each element of the matrix @xmath174 representing a separate conductor .",
    "if the scattering probability @xmath175 is reasonably isotropic , averaging over the fermi surface renders @xmath176 very small . neglecting it , and using the standard expressions for the phonon - limited and impurity parts of @xmath177 we have , for two bands,@xmath178 ,",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where the plasma frequencies are defined in their usual way for each cartesian direction .",
    "the disparity of the two band systems appears here in a trivial way , through different @xmath179 and in a non - trivial way , through different @xmath180 and different @xmath181 as described elsewhere in this chapter , the electron - phonon scattering is much stronger in the @xmath182 channel that in the other channels , and the impurity scattering is essentially always small in the interband channel ; furthermore , it is often much stronger in the @xmath183 channel than in the @xmath182 channel .",
    "the smallness of the interband impurity scattering is essential for the two - gap superconductivity ; the sample - dependence of the _ intraband _ @xmath184 especially of the @xmath185 is important for the understanding of the temperature dependence of the normal resistivity .",
    "indeed , it is usually assumed that the impurity scattering is , in the first approximation , irrelevant for the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "it is not necessarily true in a two - band system .    to start with ,",
    "let us consider a very clean sample , @xmath186 the in - plane conductivity at @xmath187 is defined by both bands , but mostly by the @xmath188 band , because it has a larger plasma frequency .",
    "the out - of - plane conductivity , of course , is defined by the @xmath18 band only .",
    "closer to room temperature the contribution of the @xmath15 band becomes smaller and smaller , because of the strong epc scattering in this band .",
    "eventually , the high-@xmath189 behaviour is dominated by the @xmath18 band with its small epc constant .",
    "temperature dependence at the high temperature ( above room temperature ) is therefore weak .",
    "let us now consider a dirty sample with @xmath190 because of the strong impurity scattering , @xmath121 electrons contribute very little to superconductivity , so the temperature dependence is defined entirely by the epc in the @xmath15 bands - and thus is strong . for a more detail discussion of these issues",
    "we refer the reader to the paper@xcite .",
    "similar effects are expected in optical conductivity ; the relevant formulas differ from eq.[rho ] only in the sense that a frequency dependence of the epc scattering should be taken into account in the usual way , and in the first line @xmath191 should be substituted by @xmath192 nontrivial effects may be expected in the dirty  regime@xcite @xmath193 in this regime the drude peak in optical conductivity that stems from the @xmath18 - electrons broadens , possibly beyond recognition , and manifests itself merely as a flat background . analyzing such a conductivity will uncover only one drude peak , the one due to @xmath15 - electrons , with a much reduced spectral weight , compared to the total plasma frequency . moreover , if @xmath194 mev , where @xmath195 is the frequency of the @xmath196 phonon , the drude peak is further renormalized by the epc and its spectral weight is reduced by a factor of ( 1+@xmath197 further discussion can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath6 is an unusual superconductor .",
    "it is not as far from conventional materials as high-@xmath112 cuprates , or triplet sr@xmath6ruo@xmath198 .",
    "the pairing symmetry is @xmath199 , the driving force is electron - phonon interaction .",
    "however , several factors distinguish mgb@xmath6 from such more usual superconductors as nb , nb@xmath52si , or even ( b , k)bio@xmath52 , to name a few .",
    "the differences mainly stem from the fact that the charge carriers in mgb@xmath9 fall into two distinctive groups : @xmath18-electrons , similar to those in graphites , and @xmath15-electrons , which represent highly unusual case of covalent bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "only the latter group demonstrate an anomalously strong interaction , and only with two phonons with sufficiently small wave vectors .",
    "this leads to a complex of uncommon features in the band structure , transport properties , and superconductivity .",
    "in particular , the superconducting state is characterized by two distinctively different order parameters .",
    "special symmetry of electronic states strongly suppresses the pair scattering by impurities from one band system to the other , thus making the two - gap superconductivity surprisingly unsensitive to sample quality .",
    "mgb@xmath9 appears to be fairly unique , and , from our point of view , it is not very likely that this compound can be optimized by a chemical modification to raise substantially its critical temperature , as opposed , for example , to high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "in course of our work on mgb@xmath0 we enjoyed exceedingly fruitful collaborations with outstanding researchers all over the world , whose names appear in our joint publications ( refs.us,liu,us2,revmgb2,mazdhva,nmrantrop,nmreva,imp ) .",
