    "the question of how particles escape from a partially confining region has long been at the center of many experimental and theoretical studies , leading to a number of profound discoveries in mathematical physics ( for a recent review see ref .",

    "lead to different escape laws ; typically quantified by the decay of the survival ( _ i.e. _ non - escape ) probability . on the quantum mechanical side ,",
    "there has been a surge of renewed interest in the escape properties of few - particle systems @xcite , in connection with recent advances in experimental control and manipulation of a small number of ultra - cold atoms @xcite . in particular , particle - particle interactions and quantum statistics",
    "have been shown to significantly influence the escape . here , we extend the theory to account for the influence of boundary conditions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 non - interacting particles in one spatial dimension which are initially ( @xmath1 ) confined within the interval @xmath2 with a hard impenetrable wall placed at the origin . a schematic plot of the setup is shown in fig.[fig : ic ] for @xmath3 particles represented as gaussian wave packets .",

    "the quantum state of the system is described by the @xmath0 particle wave function @xmath5 , which satisfies the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath0-particle hamiltonian operator and we have set the planck s constant and particle masses to unity , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the initial wave function is such that @xmath9 if @xmath10 for all @xmath11 $ ] .    under time evolution , the wave function diffuses outside @xmath12 .",
    "one way to measure this is through the survival probability @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability that all @xmath0 quantum particles are in @xmath12 at times @xmath14 . in terms of the wave function ,",
    "the survival probability is defined as @xmath15    quantum statistics obeyed by the @xmath0 particles  whether bosonic or fermionic  can have a dramatic effect on the time - decay of the survival probability .",
    "more specifically , it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the survival probability @xmath16 asymptotically decays to zero as @xmath17 for bosons and @xmath18 for fermions .",
    "this surprisingly simple , yet generic , result was obtained by an asymptotic expansion of the appropriate quantum propagator for large @xmath19 .",
    "this observation was later generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 particles , showing that @xmath13 decays like @xmath20 and @xmath21 for bosons and fermions respectively .",
    "the faster fermionic decay was attributed to the effective hard - core interaction among fermions causing anti - bunching and hindering the reconstruction of the initial state . in both works",
    "@xcite dirichlet boundary conditions were imposed at the hard wall , _ i.e. _ @xmath22 for all @xmath11 $ ] .    when a particle is constrained to move within a limited volume , dirichlet ( @xmath23 ) or neumann ( @xmath24 ) boundary conditions ( bcs )",
    "are usually employed in order to reflect local probability preservation at @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known however that the general solution to this requirement is described by a robin ( @xmath26 ) bc @xcite , defined as a weighted combination of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bcs @xmath27 and controlled by the parameter @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 corresponds to the @xmath24 and @xmath30 to the @xmath23 bcs .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 has the physical interpretation of a phase shift of the wave function on reflection with the wall at the origin .",
    "therefore , the following natural question arises : _ what is the influence of boundary conditions on the decay of the survival probability ?",
    "_ more specifically , _ how does the survival probability @xmath13 depend on @xmath31 ? _",
    "this we address in the current setting by deriving and analyzing the exact quantum propagator .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath26 bcs are commonly used in sturm - liouville type problems which appear in many contexts in engineering and applied mathematics including for example in acoustics and in convection - diffusion processes .",
    "we motivate this investigation by considering the simplest case of a single particle , @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the wave function can be described by the quantum propagator @xmath33 as @xmath34 the propagator @xcite is a generalized function that satisfies the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath35 the initial condition @xmath36 the @xmath26 bc at @xmath25 @xmath37 and that vanishes as @xmath38 at negative imaginary times , i.e. , @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "the cases of @xmath29 ( @xmath24 bc ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath23 bc ) are particularly simple . using the method of images we can immediately write down the full single - particle propagator as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the free - particle propagator , _",
    "i.e. _ the propagator describing the motion on the real line without a reflecting wall at the origin .    the asymptotic decay of @xmath43 is entirely determined by the long - time expansion of the quantum propagator .",
    "thus , @xmath44 and @xmath45 entailing @xmath46 so for the single - particle case , the @xmath23 bc leads to faster escape .",
    "when addressing the case of two particles , @xmath47 , the issue of quantum statistics comes into play . for noninteracting particles , there are two ways of taking into account bosonic ( b ) or fermionic ( f ) statistics : either ( i ) by appropriately symmetrizing the initial state of the system , @xmath48 } , \\label{psisym}\\ ] ] with `` @xmath49 '' corresponding to bosons and `` @xmath50 '' to fermions , and propagating it with @xmath51 , or ( ii ) by introducing an effective , appropriately symmetrized two - particle propagator @xmath52 \\ , , \\label{k2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and applying it upon the product state @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , the two - particle state at @xmath14 can be written as @xmath54 where the first equality corresponds to ( i ) and the second to ( ii ) .",
    "being interested in the asymptotics of the survival probability ( and inspired by ref.@xcite ) , we adopt approach ( ii ) , as it allows us to focus only on the kernel , as opposed to the full integral . in other words , the long - time decay of @xmath16 is determined by @xmath55 in the limit @xmath56 . for @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "one obtains @xmath59    it is interesting to note that the asymptotic decay of the survival probability of two fermions with the @xmath24 bc is governed by the same exponent as that of two bosons with the @xmath23 bc .",
    "this simple observation clearly illustrates that bcs imposed at the perfectly reflecting wall at the origin are as important for the particle escape as quantum statistics .",
    "it also suggests that by tuning the value of @xmath31 one may expect to probe the continuum of possible decay rates , ranging between those for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bcs .",
    "however , as we shall show in the following sections , this is not the case , as the decay exponent turns out to be a discontinuous function of @xmath31 .",
    "unlike in the special cases of @xmath29 ( @xmath24 bc ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath23 bc ) , the quantum propagator for an arbitrary @xmath31 can not be straightforwardly obtained using the method of images ; alternative techniques have to be employed .",
    "we begin our study of the single - particle survival probability by deriving an exact closed - form expression for @xmath60 , defined through eqs .",
    "( [ ke]-[propagator - boundary - condition ] ) .",
    "one way to construct the single - particle propagator @xmath61 is by using a complete orthonormal set of eigenstates @xmath62 of the hamiltonian @xmath63 , @xmath64 satisfying the @xmath26 bc at the origin , @xmath65 . as it will become clear from the following discussion ( and as originally noted in ref.@xcite ) , there is an important spectral difference between the case of @xmath66 and that of @xmath67 .",
    "we analyze the two cases in succession .    in the case of @xmath66 ,",

    "it can be verified by direct integration that the set of the eigenstates @xmath62 is orthonormal , @xmath73 and complete , @xmath74 consequently , the propagator , expressed in the basis formed by @xmath62 , reads @xmath75 in view of eq .",

    "the corresponding evaluation of the integral in the second term yields @xmath79 , where `` @xmath80 '' denotes the complementary error function . combining the two terms",

    "\\label{keta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of @xmath67 , the set of eigenstates @xmath62 no longer forms a complete basis @xcite .",
    "indeed , in addition to the unbound eigenstates , forming a continuous part of the energy spectrum , there exists an isolated bound state @xmath82 corresponding to the negative energy @xmath83 , _ i.e. _ @xmath84 .",
    "the state is normalized to unity , @xmath85 , and is orthogonal to the eigenstates of the continuous part of the energy spectrum , i.e. , @xmath86 for any @xmath87 .",
    "the wave function @xmath88 is localized in the vicinity of the hard wall , indicating that the bcs here correspond to an effective zero - range attractive force .        the presence of the bound state modifies the completeness relation ( cf .",
    "( [ phi_k - completeness ] ) ) @xmath89 so that the propagator expanded in terms of the complete basis @xmath90 reads ( cf .",
    "( [ prop_in_phi_k_basis ] ) ) @xmath91 the evaluation of the last integral for @xmath67 proceeds in the same manner as in the case of @xmath66 , and the resulting expression for the full propagator coincides with that given by eq .",
    "( [ keta ] ) .",
    "this concludes our derivation of the single - particle propagator .    at this point",
    "we remark that the problem of a single particle restricted to the positive real line by a hard wall , is equivalent to that of two hard - core particles on the full real line through a change of variables to center of mass and relative coordinates . moreover , the bcs imposed in the former correspond to the quantum statistics obeyed by the latter allowing for the possibility of anyons @xcite .",
    "the equivalence in the case of many particles is however more subtle with essential differences in higher dimensions and will not be discussed in the current paper .",
    "knowledge of the exact propagator allows us to study the full dynamical evolution of the single particle wave function @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , in order to understand the influence of bcs on the escape , it is instructive to apply @xmath93 to a spatially localized initial state given by a gaussian wave packet @xmath94 centered at @xmath95 with spatial width @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath112 , oscillations appear due to reflection off the wall and interference occurs .",
