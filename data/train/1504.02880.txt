    "continuously time evolving dynamical systems are one of the basic theoretical tools for modeling the evolution of natural phenomena in every branch of physics , chemistry , or biology .",
    "their usefulness in scientific / engineering applications is determined by their predictive power , which , in turn , strongly depends on the stability of their solutions . since in the measured initial conditions in a physical system",
    "some uncertainty inevitably does exist , a physically meaningful mathematical model must offer an understanding of the possible evolution of the deviations of the trajectories of the studied dynamical system from a given reference trajectory . note that a local understanding of the stability is as important as the global evolution and control of late - time deviations . from a mathematical point of view the global stability of the solutions of the dynamical systems",
    "is described by the well studied theory of lyapounov stability . in this approach",
    "the fundamental quantities are the lyapunov exponents , measuring exponential deviations from the given trajectory @xcite .",
    "it is usually very difficult to analytically determine the lyapounov exponents , and therefore various numerical methods for their calculation have been proposed , and are used in various situations @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the local stability of solutions of dynamical systems is much less understood .    even that the methods of the lyapounov stability analysis are well established , it would be interesting to study the stability of the dynamical system from different points of view , and to compare the results with the corresponding lyapunov exponents analysis .",
    "such an alternative approach to the study of the dynamical systems is represented by the so - called geometrodynamical approach , which was initiated in the pioneering work of kosambi @xcite , cartan @xcite and chern @xcite .",
    "the kosambi - cartan - chern ( kcc ) approach is inspired by the geometry of the finsler spaces .",
    "its basic idea is to consider that there is a one to one correspondence between a second order dynamical system and the geodesic equations in an associated finsler space ( for a recent review of the kcc theory see @xcite ) .",
    "the kcc theory is a differential geometric theory of the variational equations for the deviations of the whole trajectory to nearby ones @xcite . in this geometrical description of the dynamical systems one",
    "associates a non - linear connection , and a berwald type connection to the differential system , and five geometrical invariants are obtained .",
    "the second invariant , also called the curvature deviation tensor , gives the jacobi stability of the system @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory has been applied for the study of different physical , biochemical or technical systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative geometrization method for dynamical systems was proposed in @xcite and @xcite , and further investigated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specific applications for the henon - heiles system and bianchi type ix cosmological models were also considered . in particular , in @xcite a theoretical framework devoted to a geometrical description of the behavior of dynamical systems and their chaotic properties was developed .    in the riemmannian geometric approach to dynamical systems",
    "one starts with the well - known results that the flow associated with a time dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 can be reformulated as a geodesic flow in a curved , but conformally flat , manifold @xcite . by introducing a metric of the form @xmath1 , with the conformal factor given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the conserved energy associated with the time - independent @xmath4",
    ", it follows that the geodesic equation for motion in the metric @xmath5 is completely equivalent to the hamilton equations @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the confluence or divergence of nearby trajectories @xmath8 and @xmath9^a(s)$ ] is determined by the jacobi equation , i.e. , the equation of geodesic deviation , which takes the form = r^a_bcdu^bu^d^c - k^a_c ^c , where @xmath10 is the riemann tensor associated with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes a directional derivative along @xmath13 .",
    "linear stability for the trajectory @xmath8 is thus related to @xmath10 or , more exactly , to the curvature @xmath14 . if , for example , @xmath10 is everywhere negative , so that @xmath14 always has one or more negative eigenvalues , the trajectory must be linearly unstable @xcite .",
    "the global and local stability of solutions of continuously evolving dynamical systems was reconsidered , from a geometric perspective , in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that an unambiguous definition of stability generally requires the choice of additional geometric structures that are not intrinsic to the dynamical system itself .",
    "one of the most studied non - linear differential equations system is the lorenz system @xcite , which has been proposed as a possible description of the mechanism of the transition to weak turbulence in natural convection , by simulating thermal convection in the atmosphere , and modeling turbulent convective flow .",
    "an alternate view for the emergence of chaos in lorenz - like systems was considered in @xcite .",
    "the effects of noise on the lorenz equations in the parameter regime admitting two stable fixed point solutions and a strange attractor was studied in @xcite .",
    "absolute periods and symbolic names were assigned to stable and unstable periodic orbits of the lorenz system in @xcite .",
    "whether unstable periodic orbits associated with a strange attractor may predict the occurrence of the robust sharp peaks in histograms of some experimental chaotic time series for the lorenz equations was investigated in @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear feedback approach for controlling the lorenz equation was proposed in @xcite . a particular return map for a class of low dimensional chaotic models called kolmogorov - lorenz systems where studied from the viewpoint of energy and casimir balance in @xcite , by using a general hamiltonian description .",
    "the possibility that the lorenz system can be discussed in terms of the kcc - theory in finsler space was pointed out in @xcite , but without presenting any concrete analysis . a geometric viewpoint of the lorenz system , based on a theory of tangent bundle , was proposed in @xcite . by introducing the geometrical viewpoints of second order system governed by euler - poincar equation or lie - poisson equation , the geometrical invariants of the lorenz system have been obtained .",
    "it was shown that a torsion tensor , as one of geometrical invariants , relates to the chaotic behavior , characterized by the rayleigh number , and results from the decomposition from the second order system to the tangent space ( state space ) and base space ( configuration space ) , respectively .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider a full analysis of the lorenz equations in the framework of the kcc theory . as a first step in this approach ,",
    "the lorenz system is reformulated as a set of two second order non - linear differential equations .",
    "the geometric invariants associated to this system ( nonlinear and berwald connections ) , and the components of the deviation curvature tensor are explicitly obtained , as well as its eigenvalues .",
    "the jacobi stability of the equilibrium points of the lorenz system is studied , and the condition of the stability of the equilibrium points is obtained .",
    "finally , we consider the time evolution of the components of the deviation vector near the equilibrium points .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we reformulate the lorenz system as a set of two second order differential equations .",
    "the basics of the kcc theory to be used in the sequel are presented in section  [ kcc ] .",
    "the jacobi stability of the lorenz system is considered in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "the time evolution of the components of the deviation vector is studied in section  [ sect5 ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section  [ sect6 ] .",
    "in order to discuss the application of the kcc theory to systems of differential equations connected to fluid mechanics , we consider the lorenz system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations , given by lorenz @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are some free parameters . from a mathematical point of view",
    "these ordinary differential equations represent an approximation to a system of partial differential equations describing finite amplitude convection in a fluid layer heated from below . the lorenz system results if the unknown functions in the partial differential equations are expanded in fourier series , and all the resulting fourier coefficients are set equal to zero except three @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 can be interpreted from a physical point of view as the prandl number , the rayleigh number ( suitably normalized ) , and the wave length number , respectively .",

    "there exist therefore a critical time interval @xmath178 so that if the transition from positive to negative @xmath165 occurs at times @xmath179 , the evolution of the lorenz system is predictable , and deterministic , while if the transition occurs for time intervals @xmath180 , then the underlying evolution of the lorenz system will be chaotic in the long term .",

    "the dynamical system can be interpreted as representing the geodesic motion of a `` particle '' in an associated finsler space .",
    "this geometrization of the lorenz system opens the possibility of applying the standard methods of differential geometry for the study of its properties .",
    "we have obtained , and analyzed in detail , the main geometrical objects that can be associated to the lorenz system , namely , the non - linear connection , the berwald connection , and the first , second and third kcc invariants .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the jacobi stability condition of the equilibrium points of the lorenz system , showing that the origin is always jacobi unstable , while the jacobi stability of the other two equilibrium points depends on the values of the parameters of the system . by considering the standard values of @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 in the lorenz system , @xmath149 , @xmath148 , and @xmath195 ,",
    "it turns out that for this choice of the parameters all the equilibrium points are jacobi unstable . from the point of view of linear stability analysis , for @xmath196 ,",
    "the zero fixed point @xmath197 is globally stable ; from a physical point of view this refers to the non convective state . for @xmath198 and @xmath19",
    "not too large , the state with roll convection , referring to the @xmath199 equilibrium points , is stable @xcite . from a physical point of view",
    "this means that the phase space consists of two regions , which are separated by the stable manifold of the zero fixed point ; the trajectories which start in one of the two regions are attracted by the corresponding nonzero fixed point .",
    "we have also considered in detail the behavior of the deviation vector near the equilibrium points . in order to describe the behavior of the trajectories near the equilibrium points we have introduced the instability exponent @xmath139 , as well as the curvature @xmath165 of the deviation vector trajectories .",
    "the curvature @xmath165 of the curve @xmath147 can be related directly to the chaotic behavior of the trajectories via its transition moment from positive to negative values .",
    "an early transition indicates the presence of chaotic states .",
    "therefore we suggest the use of the curvature of the deviation vector as an indicator of the onset of chaos in non - linear dynamical systems .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that the torsion tensor geometrically expresses the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems , i.e. a trajectory of dynamical systems with the torsion tensor is not closed . by using the same definition as in @xcite it turns out that indeed there is a non - zero torsion tensor component @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
