    "asymmetry is often observed in rotation curves of spiral galaxies . like the rotation curve",
    ", asymmetries indicate the forces and dynamics in a galaxy .",
    "small deviations in the rotation curves of a few @xmath0 are well known @xcite .",
    "large deviations are less appreciated @xcite because the observational data are generally averaged .",
    "hence , only highly asymmetric cases such as ngc 4321 @xcite and ngc 3031 @xcite are recognized .",
    "the rotation curves of all the nearby galaxies where the kinematics are studied have asymmetry such as ngc 0224 @xcite and ngc 0598 @xcite .",
    "asymmetry has also been reported in the inner parts of the optical disk @xcite .",
    "rotation curve asymmetry appears to be the norm rather than the exception @xcite .",
    "@xciteand @xcite proposed the implied mass asymmetry is due to a galaxy interaction . in this paper ,",
    "the rotation curve asymmetry from our viewpoint is related to the strength of the forces from neighboring galaxies .",
    "a qualitative correlation of rotation curve shape with rotation curve asymmetry is shown .",
    "this result suggests the rotation curve shape is naturally rising and neighboring galaxies cause flat and declining rotation curves .",
    "these results are inconsistent with mond , dark matter , and the linear potential model .",
    "@xcite ( hereinafter paper 1 ) found the observed magnitude of a target galaxy depends on the radiant energy of neighboring galaxies and on the intrinsic luminosity of the target galaxy .",
    "the potential energy field of neighboring galaxies may also produce observable effects in target galaxies .    consider a particle in the disk region of a spiral galaxy .",
    "if there are no outside forces , the intrinsic orbit of the particle will be achieved by a delicate balance of the intrinsic forces of the galaxy .",
    "the circular orbits of galaxy disks ( @xcite , pages 723 - 4 ) imply the intrinsic forces are centrally directed .",
    "therefore , a small , external force directed nearly uniformly across the plane of the galaxy may cause a perturbation in the orbit and in the rotational velocity of particles in the disk .",
    "thus , the asymmetry of the rotation velocity curve may be a sensitive indicator of the external forces exerted on a galaxy s particles .    to test the effects of the potential energy field of neighboring galaxies , a measure of galaxy mass",
    "is needed .",
    "commonly , mass is derived from rotation curve models .",
    "however , such mass calculations are lacking for most galaxies .",
    "paper 1 and @xcite suggested the success of the tully - fisher relationship ( tf ) implies that the ratio of intrinsic mass to intrinsic luminosity is constant among galaxies .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( in units of magnitude ) is the intrinsic absolute b band magnitude @xmath3 of the @xmath4 neighbor galaxy .",
    "the adjective `` intrinsic '' means after the luminosity effects of neighbor galaxies have been subtracted ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the force @xmath5 on a particle in the @xmath6 target galaxy exerted by a number @xmath7 of neighboring close galaxies is , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector distance from the @xmath6 target galaxy to the @xmath4 neighbor galaxy , @xmath10 is the constant of proportionality such that the units of @xmath5 are dynes , and @xmath11 is the mass of the test particle in the target galaxy .",
    "the bold letters denote vectors .",
    "the same letter not bold denotes the magnitude of the vector .",
    "the letters in parentheses are indices denoting the galaxy .",
    "for ease of calculation @xmath2 is without the correction found in paper 1 .",
    "hence , the @xmath10 factor also contains a constant which is the average change in luminosity of the @xmath4 galaxy due to re - emitted radiant energy from neighboring galaxies . from paper 1 , the deviation from average of the re - emitted energy will produce an error in @xmath12 of @xmath13 0.3 magnitude .",
    "define @xmath14 as @xmath15 in a coordinate system that is galactocentric , right - handed , and cartesian , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the component vectors of @xmath15 in the direction of the minor axis , major axis , and polar axis of the @xmath6 target galaxy , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath18 acts radially along the major axis , the effect of the central force of a galaxy @xmath20 along the major axis is reduced if the measurement of asymmetry is at the same radius from the center on each side of the galaxy .",
    "define the rotation curve asymmetry @xmath21 as the maximum difference in rotation velocity along the major axis between one side of the center of a galaxy to the other measured at the same radius from the center of the galaxy .",
    "consider the effect of @xmath14 on @xmath21 is exerted proportionally by a vector @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the unit vectors in the minor axis direction , the major axis direction , and the polar axis direction of the @xmath6 target galaxy , respectively , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are coefficients of the corresponding unit vectors , and the @xmath31 means the absolute value .",
    "the direction of @xmath32 is directed eastward along the axis defined by the position angle ( pa ) .",
    "the @xmath33 is perpendicular to @xmath32 , in the plane of the galaxy , and directed away from the milky way .",
    "a right - handed coordinate system means @xmath34 . in conformity to paper 1",
    ", a positive orientation sign implies @xmath33 has a component directed southward and @xmath27 has a component directed away from the milky way .",
    "a negative orientation sign implies @xmath33 has a component directed northward and @xmath27 has a component directed toward the milky way .",
    "the kinematic minor axis is the direction along which the line - of - sight motion equals the systemic velocity .",
    "the kinematic major axis is the direction along which the line - of - sight motion peaks as a function of angle about the galactic center .",
    "the tilted ring model predicts the kinematic minor axis is perpendicular to kinematic major axis .",
    "galaxies with warped disks may have curved kinematic axes . in this paper ,",
    "the major and minor axes are not kinematic axes when a warp is present .",
    "the @xmath22 is found by plotting @xmath21 versus @xmath35 such that a best fit of equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) results .",
    "since the distance to neighboring galaxies is much greater than the diameter of galaxies , the first approximation is that @xmath14 is uniform across a galaxy .",
    "the asymmetry in the hi rotation curve is a sensitive tracer of @xmath35 .",
    "the criteria for choosing target galaxies for the analysis are ( 1 ) the galaxy has a published cepheid distance @xmath36 and a published hi rotation curve asymmetry , ( 2 ) the distance to the galaxy must be large enough that the milky way s contribution is negligible , ( 3 ) the distance to the galaxy must be large enough that the contribution of peculiar velocity to the redshift @xmath37 measurement is relatively small among the galaxies around the target galaxy , and ( 4 ) a published apparent magnitude in the b band @xmath38 must be available for both the target and close galaxies .",
    "nine galaxies were found to meet these criteria .",
    "the data for the sample of nine target galaxies are presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the morphology was taken from the ned database .",
    "the rotation curve shape and measured @xmath21 were taken from the references .",
    "the galaxy orientation sign which was used to determine the component vectors of @xmath14 was taken from paper 1 .",

    "the sample of target galaxies has low surface brightness ( lsb ) , medium surface brightness ( msb ) , and high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies , galaxies with a range of 21-cm line width at 20% of peak value corrected for inclination @xmath39 from 122 @xmath40 to 654 @xmath40 , includes liner , sy , hii and less active galaxies , galaxies with a absolute b magnitude ( `` mabs '' from the leda database ) from -22.11 mag . to -17.03 mag .",
    ", a distance range from 1.13 mpc to 14.73 mpc , and field and cluster galaxies .",
    "the ned database was used to assemble a list of galaxies closest to each of the target galaxies .",
    "the selection of close galaxies used the hubble law with a hubble constant @xmath41 of 70 @xmath42 and galactic z to calculate the distances to galaxies .",
    "the angular coordinates were taken from the ned database .",
    "for each target galaxy , the distance from each target galaxy to each of the other galaxies was calculated .",
    "the neighbor galaxies with the smallest distance were chosen as the close galaxies .",
    "the uncertainty of the value of @xmath41 is high .",
    "the use of @xmath41 herein is restricted to only choosing the close galaxies to each target galaxy .",
    "as the relative distances become larger , the distance uncertainty increases if only because of a greater variation in peculiar velocity .",
    "therefore , there is a practical upper limit on the number of galaxies that can be used to evaluate @xmath14 .",
    "if too few close galaxies are used , @xmath14 will be underestimated . following paper 1 , the number of close galaxies found to produce the highest correlation coefficient was 10 .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc 4321 at 4 arcmin implies it has a declining shape .",
    "ngc 4321 has a large asymmetry in the south west lobe of 209 @xmath43 which can not be interpreted as disk rotation @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath44 rotation curve is flat out to 20 kpc with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the receding side of the hi rotation curve of ngc 4321 is declining and appears more normal .",
    "the approaching side of the hi rotation curve of ngc 4321 is `` lopsided '' @xcite and is sharply rising after a slight decline . @xcite",
    "suggested the hi rotation curve is declining .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) were calculated as in paper 1 . because @xmath47 is more uncertain without a secure distance ( @xmath36 ) to each galaxy , the value used for @xmath47 was not the intrinsic magnitude .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath14 was overestimated .",
    "this causes the value of @xmath48 to have a larger scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] is a plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath48 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath22 were determined such that variance between the line with a slope of one and data ( f test ) is maximized and the sum of the difference between the points and the line is minimized , @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 , the slope @xmath52 , and the intercept @xmath53 .",
    "the error is 1 @xmath54 , the correlation coefficient is 0.99 , and the f test is 0.99 .    figure  [ fig:2 ] is a plot of @xmath21 versus rotation curve type .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] suggests a qualitative correlation between @xmath21 and the slope of the sample galaxies rotation curve in the disk region .",
    "the @xmath21 is defined at the radius from the center along the major axis with the maximum asymmetry in rotation velocity .",
    "we speculate this implies the dynamics of galaxies are a function of radius from the center rather than a number of scaling factors .",
    "since both paper 1 and this paper require the orientation sign of the target galaxy to be established , the method of this paper may confirm the orientation sign that the paper 1 method finds .",
    "paper 1 used luminosity ( @xmath3 ) as an indicator of the radiant energy from a neighbor galaxy .",
    "this paper used luminosity as an indicator of mass in a neighbor galaxy .",
    "luminosity , mass , and radiant energy of a galaxy appear tightly related .",
    "the difference between radiant energy s action and potential energy s action on a target galaxy is in the way energy is transferred .",
    "the amount of radiant energy transferred to a target galaxy depends on the surface area presented to the neighbor galaxy .",
    "hence , the radiant energy transferred is maximal if the neighbor galaxy is along the target galaxy s polar axis and minimal if the neighbor galaxy is in the plane of the target galaxy .",
    "the potential energy transferred is at a maximum if the neighbor galaxy is in the target galaxy s plane and at a minimum if the neighbor galaxy is along the polar axis of the target galaxy .",
    "paper 1 concluded that the contribution of the conservative , potential field of neighboring galaxies contributed no energy to the b - band luminosity because matter in a galaxy orbited in radial shells of constant mass .",
    "the target galaxy s movement in the intergalactic potential field could cause only minimal heat change .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the paper 1 correction factor @xmath55 and @xmath21 is -0.04 , between @xmath55 and @xmath35 is -0.09 , between the paper 1 impinging energy @xmath56 and @xmath21 is 0.61 , and between @xmath56 and @xmath35 is 0.65 .",
    "these poor correlations imply the potential energy field of the close galaxies has little or no effect on the @xmath3 measurement of the target galaxies .",
    "@xcite found a strong correlation between a galaxy s luminosity and rotation curve shape .",
    "low luminosity galaxies have rising rotation curves ; high luminosity galaxies have flat and declining rotation curves .",
    "this paper found close neighbor galaxies appear to cause higher asymmetry in the rotation curve and to cause flat and declining rotation curves .",
    "also , this paper suggests that without the influence of neighboring galaxies ( intrinsic ) , the rotation curve would be rising .",
    "paper 1 found close neighbor galaxies appear to cause higher luminosity in a galaxy depending on the orientation of the galaxy relative to the close galaxies .",
    "therefore , neighboring galaxies cause differences in the mass / luminosity ratio among galaxies by increasing the apparent luminosity as outlined in paper 1 .",
    "the dark matter model ( dmm ) expects the intrinsic rotation curve to be declining .",
    "if dark matter ( dm ) is considered part of a galaxy s mass , the constant intrinsic mass to luminosity ratio among galaxies implies the ratio of dm to luminous mass is also constant among galaxies . to have a rising rotation curve caused by dm implies the potential caused by the dm must increase with radius while the luminous mass is decreasing with radius . if galaxies have differing mass because of differing mass infall rates , then the constant ratio of dm to luminous mass and the required dm distribution seems implausible .",
    "the linear potential model ( lpm ) explored by mannheim and kazanas @xcite proposes a gravitational potential of the form @xmath57 .",
    "the lpm predicts rising rotation curves are the intrinsic shape and flat rotation curves are a result of mass distribution within the galaxy . also , the lpt predicts declining rotation curves require other galaxy influence with a linear potential and a very delicate balance .",
    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) model @xcite expects the intrinsic rotation curve to be flat and flat rotation curves to be axis symmetric .",
    "the finding of this paper is inconsistent with the lpm , the mond model , and the dmm .",
    "the rotation curve asymmetry is linearly related to the force from neighboring galaxies .",
    "the relation is @xmath58 at 1 @xmath54 where @xmath59 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.99 with f test of 0.99 .",
