    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) experiments provide insight into the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics such as entanglement , decoherence and measurement @xcite .",
    "additionally , optical cqed is currently growing into a key role in quantum information processing @xcite , where the transmission of quantum states between distant nodes is a central problem @xcite , and in entanglement - enhanced metrology @xcite , where the use of optical cavities has very recently lead to convincing demonstrations of metrologically useful spin squeezing capable of improving the stability of atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "a fundamental figure of merit of the atom - cavity system is its cooperativity @xmath2 , which up to factors of order 1 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 it the cross - section and @xmath5 the finesse of the cavity mode , and @xmath6 is the ( effective ) scattering cross - section of the emitter(s ) placed in this mode . for example , the purcell effect arises when @xmath7 and the efficiency of an important class of single - photon sources scales as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in addition to having a high ccoperativity , cavities used in quantum information applications should be miniaturized and fiber - coupled so that they can be used in scalable setups . this motivates considerable efforts to develop miniature high - finesse cavities @xcite .",
    "however , no cavity type so far unites all desired properties in a single device .",
    "therefore , progress in cqed and its applications hinges on the development of new , miniature cavities with high cooperativity .    here",
    "we describe a fiber - based fabry - perot cavity ( ffpc ) that combines tunability and high finesse with excellent and stable coupling to single - mode optical fibers , which is achieved without mode - matching optics .",
    "the waist @xmath9 is about an order of magnitude smaller than in the macroscopic high - finesse cavities typically used in optical cqed experiments @xcite .",
    "the cavity mode is located in free space , making it easy to couple to atomic emitters .",
    "the cavity design is based on a new laser machining process where a single , focused co@xmath0 laser pulse creates a concave depression in the cleaved fiber surface . the first use of this ffpc was in an experiment that demonstrated strong - coupling cqed with bose - einstein condensates on atom chips @xcite , prompted by these results , the use of such cavities is now being explored with trapped neutral atoms and ions @xcite , but also with color centers in diamond @xcite , semiconductors @xcite and vibrating sub - wavelength objects @xcite . in all of these applications ,",
    "the small size , ruggedness and built - in fiber coupling of the ffpc are advantageous , favouring its use in hostile environments such as cryostats .",
    "moreover , we have already obtained single - atom cooperativities @xmath10 @xcite , and still higher values can be expected when using state - of - the art dielectric coatings .",
    "this combines with the good fiber coupling , such that decisive progress can be expected from this ffpc for several applications : it should lead to single - photon sources @xcite with exceptional overall performance , where not only an atomic excitation is converted into a cavity photon with a probability close to one , but also this photon is efficiently extracted into a single - mode optical fiber . for similar reasons , the ffpc may improve the performance of quantum memories @xcite , where currently the overall conversion efficiency between the memory qubit and the desired optical mode is still low .",
    "it will also enable single - atom state detection ( `` qubit readout '' ) with high quantum efficiency , and may enable optical detection with less than a single photon scattered by the emitter @xcite . in this article , we present a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of this new type of fiber cavity .",
    "the core of our cavity design is a concave , ultralow - roughness mirror surface fabricated directly on the end face of an optical fiber .",
    "ffpcs with mirrors on fiber end faces have been built before @xcite , but until now had only moderate finesse ( up to a few 1000 ) , limited by the methods used to fabricate the concave surface on the fiber .",
    "here we use a single co@xmath0 laser pulse to shape the concave mirror surface , which is then coated with a high - performance dielectric coating .",
    "as we show below , this improves the finesse by more than an order of magnitude over the older methods and gives access to an interesting range of small radius of curvature ( roc ) . as in our earlier design using glued mirrors @xcite , a stable cavity is then constructed either from one mirror fiber tip facing a macroscopic , planar or concave mirror , or from two closely spaced fiber tips placed face to face ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) . in this article",
    ", we will be mainly interested in the second variant .",
    "radii of curvature can be fabricated down to @xmath11 m and probably below .",
    "because of the small mirror diameter @xmath12 ( smaller than the fiber diameter , which is typically @xmath13 m ) , the mirrors can approach each other very closely ( down to a few @xmath14 ) without touching .",
    "the result is a very small mode waist @xmath9 between 1 and @xmath15 m , and a small mode volume down to a few @xmath16 .",
    "the small @xmath9 combined with a length much shorter than the rayleigh range is the reason for the excellent sm fiber coupling efficiency with no need for mode - matching optics . as we discuss theoretically in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] and demonstrate experimentally in sec .",
    "[ sec : couplingexp ] .",
    "as will be described in more detail in @xcite , we have found a parameter regime where a single pulse of co@xmath0 laser radiation focussed onto the cleaved end face of an optical fiber produces a concave surface with extremely low roughness ( figure  [ fig : surface ] ) . in this regime ,",
    "thermal evaporation occurs , while melting is restricted to a thin surface region , avoiding global contraction into a convex shape .",
    "this sets it apart from the regimes used in co@xmath0 laser - based fabrication of microspheres @xcite and transformation of microdiscs into high - q microtoroid resonators @xcite .",
    "we can currently laser machine structures with roc between @xmath17 m and 2 mm , diameters between 10 and @xmath18 m , and a surface roughness of about 0.2 nm rms in the optical range .",
    "these structures are obtained with co@xmath0 waist sizes between 18 and @xmath19 m , powers in the range @xmath20w and pulse lengths between 5 and 400ms .",
    "a dichroic beam splitter and optical microscope are used to align the fiber with respect to the co@xmath0 laser focus . in our current setup",
    ", we estimate the lateral alignment precision to be better than 2@xmath21 m .",
    "we have laser machined a large number ( @xmath22 ) of fiber mirror structures .",
    "initially , we used an afm to get both profile and roughness data . scanning the full surface to determine curvatures is a slow process however , so that we could only measure a small number of fibers with this method . to get approximate values for other fibers , we compared them to the well - characterized ones under an optical microscope .",
    "more recently , we have used an interferometric microscope for measurements of the large - scale ( @xmath23 ) surface topography .",
    "this method is fast enough to characterize each individual fiber in reasonable time .",

    "rocs measured at the bottom of the depression are between @xmath35 and @xmath36 m .",
    "part of the processed surfaces show a slight ellipticity ( up to a few percent ) , which is probably due to an observed astigmatism of the co@xmath0 beam : when varying the fiber position along the co@xmath0 beam axis , the beam profile changes from circular to elliptical .",
    "alignment error along this axis translates into ellipticity of the depression .",
    "this could easily be improved in a future setup .",

    "[ fig : fceff],scaledwidth=90.0% ]      as the cavity mirrors are part of the incoupling and outcoupling fibers , coupling to and from the cavity is robust and stable over time .",
    "this is one key advantage of the ffpc .",
    "there are no mode - matching lenses , so coupling efficiency is given directly by the mode matching between the mode leaving the fiber and the cavity mode . if single - mode operation is not required  such as for the output fiber in a cavity transmission measurement  a multimode ( mm ) fiber can be used on the output side @xcite .",
    "this virtually eliminates coupling loss and also makes the cavity more robust against various types of misalignment , such as centering errors between the mirror and the fiber core . but even for sm fibers , the coupling efficiency @xmath96 is typically very high , in spite of the strong mirror curvature .",
    "for example , we have measured @xmath103 for a sm fiber and a mirror with @xmath104 m ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : couplingexp ] ) .",
    "this high efficiency can be seen as a consequence of the small cavity mode radius , which leads to small phase difference across the relevant mode cross - sections even for strongly curved wavefronts . to get a feeling for the orders of magnitude , consider a spherical wavefront with roc @xmath105 .",

    "this has several simplifying consequences : first , the lensing effect by the curved fiber surface can be neglected , and second , the power coupling efficiency @xmath96 between the fiber and cavity modes can be approximated simply by the overlap integral of the fiber and cavity mode intensity distributions , neglecting phase mismatch . for a sm fiber with its nearly gaussian transverse mode profile of radius @xmath110 , and assuming that the cavity mode is well aligned with the fiber axis , we thus obtain the simple estimate @xmath111 where @xmath98 is the cavity mode s radius on the mirror . a more complete expression including lensing effect and wavefront curvature is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the refractive index of the fiber and @xmath25 the roc of the mirror .",

    "a possible drawback of this configuration is its waist size , @xmath117 : @xmath118 is typically much larger than the minimum @xmath9 which ffpcs can achieve .",
    "if a mm fiber is used on the outcoupling side , the coupling coefficient is determined by its numerical aperture @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath120 is the acceptance angle of the fiber , which must be compared to the full divergence angle of the cavity mode .",
    "the latter grows from 0 ( in the waist ) up to @xmath121 ( for @xmath122 ) . as an example , for a typical @xmath123 at @xmath44 nm , in the worst case of a long cavity ( @xmath124 ) , the waist can still be made as small as @xmath125 m before the mode divergence becomes larger than the acceptance angle of the fiber .",
    "the large acceptance angle also makes the cavity more robust with respect to misalignment .      in some applications ,",
    "a larger mirror distance is required , for example to introduce an object such as a membrane @xcite ) , to minimize trap distortion and heating in an ion trap , or to reduce the fsr .",
    "as @xmath54 is increased , the mode radius on at least one of the mirrors will also increase , and this limits the cavity length through two effects : first , fiber coupling efficiency decreases , which may or may not be a problem depending on the application .",
    "then , cavity finesse decreases due to clipping loss .    in this section",
    ", we will consider these effects for just one of the fiber mirrors , calling @xmath12 the mirror diameter , @xmath98 the cavity mode radius on this mirror , and @xmath110 the mode field radius in its fiber .",

    "\\(b ) to estimate clipping loss on the the finite - diameter fiber mirrors , we conservatively assume a gaussian cavity mode and consider its `` spillover '' loss upon reflection on a finite - diameter mirror . for a single reflection , @xmath131 where @xmath98 is the mode radius of the mode impinging on the mirror of diameter @xmath12 . if @xmath132 is to contribute less than 10% to the total loss , @xmath133 the mode radius on the mirror must verify @xmath134 in the finesse range of interest here , @xmath135 . with our current fabrication limit of @xmath136",
    "m , we thus have @xmath137 m in the most demanding case ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "this limitation is generally less restrictive than the one imposed by good fiber coupling .",
