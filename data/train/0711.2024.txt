    "for example , although x - ray - selected samples contain a very small fraction of extragalactic sources and galactic field stars , x - ray sources that have optical and infrared ( ir ) counterparts are mostly cluster members .",
    "this is in contrast to the high percentage of non - members in the optical / ir images where , except for those sources with massive dusty disks , membership for individual stars generally has to be ascertained via spectroscopy . in initial mass function ( imf )",
    "studies of more distant , high mass star forming regions , traditional optical measurements are significantly encumbered by large reddening and membership confusion . in comparison to the massive stars , the lower mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stellar populations are much less accessible and thus much harder to evaluate . in the past",
    ", @xmath11 emission was used in general as a youth and membership indicator . however , in addition to the observational challenges due to prevalent bright @xmath11 nebulosity in hii regions , the emission itself requires accretion activity in protoplanetary disks @xcite and thus is susceptible to the disk evolutionary stages .",
    "it has long been recognized that x - ray emission circumvents these problems and is very effective for securing pms membership of young clusters @xcite .",

    "the rosette star - forming complex , situated in a large star formation site in the perseus spiral arm , provides an ideal testbed for studying sequential formation of clusters due to the favorable orientation of its morphological components , consisting of an expanding blister hii region on the edge of a giant molecular cloud oriented perpendicular to the line - of - sight . thorough review of past and present research on this popular and important star formation region appear in @xcite ( hereafter tfm03 ) and @xcite ( hereafter rl07 ) .",

    "the rosette nebula (= sharpless 275 = w 16 = ngc 22372239 , ngc 2244 , and ngc 2246 ) is a large hii region at the tip of the rosette molecular cloud ( rmc ) . in both radio and optical images",

    "previous imaging study of the rosette complex was hampered by low spatial resolution .",
    "an early _ einstein observatory _ study detected a few individual o stars and extended @xmath13  kev x - ray emission at the center of the nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the integrated contribution from x - ray emitting low mass pms stars in the cluster and concluded that apparently diffuse emission seen by _ rosat _ could be explained by unresolved point sources .",
    "@xcite analyzed the same _ rosat _ data set and attributed the brightest x - ray sources to massive stars , active t tauri stars , and foreground stars .",
    "@xcite , studying a _ rosat _ observation of the rmc , reported faint x - ray point sources associated with t tauri stars and herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars and x - ray `` hot spots '' from unresolved embedded low mass star clusters .",

    "it was attributed to a combination of fast o star winds and unresolved t tauri stars .",
    "the young stars powering the rosette hii region are members of the massive open cluster ngc 2244 . figure  [ fig : large_view]b shows a digital sky survey image ( @xmath17 ) of this region with a few bright stars and interesting objects labeled . despite its apparent low concentration of stars in the optical , ngc 2244 contains @xmath18 early - type stars between o4v and b3v ( table 6 in tfm03 ) , whose cluster memberships are secured from deep photometric study along with proper motion data and spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "we present collective properties of interesting x - ray sources in  5 , ending with a summary in  6 .",
    "the rosette complex was observed with the imaging array of the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) .",
    "the acis - i field of view is @xmath26 in a single pointing and a mosaic observation was designed to best image the ionizing cluster , capture the interface between the photoionized gas and the cold neutral material , step into the dense molecular cloud , and study its recently reported secondary cluster . as shown in table  1 , the entire observation consisted of four @xmath1020 ks acis - i snapshots in january 2001 ( tfm03 , figure  2 ) , a deep 75 ks acis - i image in january 2004 centered on the o5 star hd  46150 in ngc 2244 ( figure  [ fig : diffuse]a ) , and one 20 ks acis - i pointing at the twin cluster to ngc 2244 @xcite in 2007 .",

    "we follow the same customized data reduction and source extraction described in tfm03 , @xcite , and @xcite . the processing of level 1 data is presented in detail in appendix b of tfm03 ; the same reduced dataset used in that study ( rosette field 1 - 4 ) , augmented by the deep observation ( rosette nebula / ngc 2244 ) reduced following tfm03 , were used here for further analysis . with slightly different roll angles , we reprojected the obsid 1874 data and merged them with the obsid 3750 field .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffuse]a shows the merged 94 ks acis image of ngc 2244 overlaid with source extraction regions ( see details below ) .",

    "[ fig : diffuse]c the existence of soft diffuse emission is emphasized in the context of the dss optical image , where the diffuse x - ray emission nicely fills in the cavity of the hii region .",
    "this component will be discussed in paper iv .",
    "for identifying x - ray point sources , first we assemble a large number of candidate sources using a variety of techniques and criteria , including image reconstruction and visual inspection .",
    "the source searching for ngc 2244 is performed on the merged fields from obsid 1874 and obsid 3750 . for each of the acis fields ,",
    "twelve different images were created : soft ( 0.52  kev ) , hard ( 27  kev ) , and full ( 0.57  kev ) x - ray wavebands with four different pixel binning scales ( 4@xmath28 , @xmath102@xmath28 , 1@xmath28 , and 0.5@xmath28 a sky pixel ) .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ program @xcite was run with wavelet scales from 1 to 16 , 8 , 4 , and 2 pixels in steps of @xmath29 ( for the four different binnings respectively ) and a source significance threshold of @xmath30 ( which is very sensitive but permits some false sources ) on each of the images described above .",
    "these twelve source lists were merged , with the source position from the highest - resolution image retained , to generate a single list of candidate sources .    to take advantage of the sub - arcsecond point spread function ( psf ) at positions around the aimpoint , we applied a subpixel positioning code @xcite to improve spatial resolution in the inner part of the field .",
    "an image reconstruction with the lucy - richardson maximum likelihood algorithm @xcite was performed in the central @xmath31 around hd 46150 ( figure  [ fig : o_cluster ] ) in obsid 3750 ( examples of maximum likelihood image reconstruction can be found in * ? ? ?",

    "eighteen additional candidate sources from the image reconstruction were added to the source list .",
    "adaptive - kernel smoothed flux images in the three energy bands were also created with _ csmooth _ to help visually identify additional faint potential sources .",

    "the luminosity bins with the steep slope seen in the ngc 2244 xlf are much brighter than the completeness limit .",
    "a few possible extrinsic reasons may account for the slope deviation from the onc xlf .",

    "the @xmath123 correlation is derived from the very young onc , but may vary for the older clusters like ngc 2244 .",
    "second , the exclusion of some hot stars to construct an xlf comparable to the coup xlf could implicitly affect the resulting xlf",
    ". we examined luminosities ( @xmath136 ) of these ob stars , which mostly contribute to the luminosity bins around @xmath137 ergs s@xmath2 ; an xlf including them still shows the observed deviation from the onc .",
    "there are two possibilities intrinsic to the ngc 2244 cluster that may be responsible for the apparent steeper slope : ( i ) the ngc 2244 population is the same as the coup population , but there is an excess of @xmath138 stars in the luminosity range @xmath139 ( solar mass stars as inferred from the @xmath134 relation ) ; or ( ii ) the ngc 2244 population is @xmath140 times larger than the coup population , but ngc 2244 is @xmath141 stars deficient in stars with @xmath142 ( intermediate mass stars ) . in either case , the ngc 2244 xlf deviates from a scaled version of the coup xlf in a manner similar to that seen in the cep b / ob3b field studied by @xcite .    to improve the statistics , remove possible binning effects , and further investigate how the ngc 2244 xlf compares to that of the onc and other clusters",

    "* ) populations .",
    "the resulting cumulative xlfs are shown in figure  [ fig : xlf]b .",
    "to avoid confusion caused by incompleteness in detections , we cut off the cumulative xlfs at the corresponding completeness limit for each region ( see figure  [ fig : xlf ] ) . at a given x - ray luminosity above the completeness limit , the ratio between the cumulative numbers of sources from two populations reflects the relative scaling between the two populations that are more luminous than this limit . as a result ,",

    "the cumulative x - ray luminosity function of ngc 2244 closely follows the coup xlf , although the deviation found in figure  8 ( deficit at @xmath146 and excess at @xmath147 ) can still be clearly seen . depending on the treatment of this deviation , the ngc 2244 population ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 times the onc population .",
    "further investigations were made to examine the possible excess of sources with @xmath148 ergs s@xmath2 . to identify a previously unknown cluster in the field that may contribute extra stars to ngc 2244",
    ", we inspected the spatial distribution of sources that have luminosities in the excess bins , but did not find any apparent clustering . to test whether this excess comes from contamination of x - ray bright non - members , we removed candidate contaminants ( foreground stars , background stars , extragalactic sources ) as suggested in   [ sec : contamination ] and reconstructed the xlf .",
    "the number drop mainly appears in low luminosity bins while the excess is still significant at @xmath149 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore we conclude that excluding candidate contaminants would not alter the xlf , since they do not contribute much to the high luminosity bins that characterize the x - ray emitting population .      to examine whether the deviation in the xlf is a reflection of an intrinsic anomalous imf in the ngc 2244 cluster , we perform two tests on the imfs using nir data .",
    "one experiment is to use the location of x - ray stars in the ir color magnitude diagram to derive their masses and construct an approximate imf",
    ". the exact mass will not be as accurate as measured from spectral types and an hr diagram , but their statistical distribution should be sufficient for our interest here . if there is indeed an excess of x - ray sources with @xmath150 ergs s@xmath2 ( option i in  4.1 ) , from the empirical @xmath134 relation @xcite , we would expect to see an excess of stars around a solar mass . figure  [ fig : imf ] shows the imf constructed from nir estimated masses for unobscured coup stars and for ngc 2244 stars .",
    "no excess is apparent for stars in the solar mass range , after the onc imf @xcite is scaled to match the ngc 2244 imf .",
    "instead , a deficit of intermediate mass stars around @xmath151 m@xmath0 in the x - ray selected sample is apparent ( option ii in  4.1 ) .",
    "a second test is to obtain a statistical sample of cluster members and construct a klf @xcite following the cep b / ob3b klf analysis in @xcite .",
    "we used 2mass @xmath68 data to constuct the klf since it was spatially complete toward ngc 2244 and it is photometrically complete to a similar mass limit as our _ chandra _ data for the rosette . a control field from 2mass centered at ( @xmath152 ) = ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) [ j2000 ] is used for background population subtraction ( extinction toward this control field and in the foreground of ngc 2244 is low ; see li 2005 for its 2mass color - color diagram ) .",
    "the resulting klf is similar to that derived by li ( 2005 ) with a power law slope @xmath155 . to get the imf , we convert @xmath68 magnitude to @xmath156 using the 2  myr theoretical isochrone",
    "the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath156 from the theoretical isochrone @xcite can be approximated well with a power law as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the resulting imf derived from @xmath5-band star counting ( dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : imf ] ) is consistent with the imf estimated from nir properties of _ chandra _ sources ( solid histogram in figure  [ fig : imf ] ) .",
    "note that the mass derived using k magnitude as a proxy for photospheric luminosity can be biased towards higher mass for k - excess sources .",
    "however , our imf estimated from klf is justified ; the fraction of @xmath5-excess sources in our sample is low and the imf inferred from the klf is coarsely binned ( @xmath157 ) to account for the effect of k - excess on the estimated mass .",
    "this klf suggests that our x - ray sample is largely complete down to @xmath133 , consistent with the mass limit estimated from the x - ray completeness limit .",
    "it also suggests that our x - ray selected sample is missing @xmath141 intermediate - mass stars around 3 m@xmath0 .",
    "it is not surprising that the detection efficiency of intermediate - mass stars in the x - ray band is not as deep as in optical or ir @xcite .",
    "the x - ray production mechanism is not well understood for stars in the intermediate - mass range (   [ sec : haebes ] ) . in many cases of x - ray detections of intermediate - mass stars",
    ", the x - ray emission in fact comes from a low mass companion to the intermediate mass star . compared to the onc",
    ", some of the intermediate - mass stars in ngc 2244 may be x - ray quiet because of the absence of low - mass companions .",
    "this is reflected as the deficit of @xmath158 ergs s@xmath2 sources in the xlf .",
    "the dynamical evolution history of the young cluster might result in a lower fraction of intermediate - mass stars with secondaries .",
    "surveys of intermediate - mass member stars in ngc  2244 to measure their multiplicity , such as the binarity study of sco ob2 intermediate - mass stars by @xcite , are needed . under this assumption ,",
    "the `` excess '' of @xmath159 ergs s@xmath2 sources would then be the result of a slightly larger population of ngc 2244 stars compared to that of the onc .",
    "based on all the above analysis , we conclude that the unobscured x - ray emitting ngc 2244 population is about 1.2 times larger than the known unobscured population in onc , or @xmath101000 stars with @xmath160 ergs s@xmath2 ( the coup detection limit ) .",
    "the obscured population , estimated from similar xlf scaling , is @xmath10 500 stars .",
    "given that the total coup sample accounts for @xmath161 of the onir sample of the onc in @xcite , we estimate that the total size of the ngc 2244 stellar population is around 2000 .",

    "indeed , their optical sample becomes incomplete for stars with masses lower than @xmath165 . in comparison to the traditional imf studies ,",
    "our high sensitivity x - ray sample of stars largely benefits from our robust membership criteria and our ability to identify the low - mass members in a reliable manner . the imf slope obtained from the x - ray selected membership , which is nearly complete to 0.5@xmath166 , gives @xmath167 instead of @xmath168 , consistent with the orion imf .",
    "the morphology of young clusters , including dependency on stellar mass , provides clues for cluster formation and dynamical evolution . as morphological studies based on optical or infrared samples",
    "are complicated by patchy extinction , nebular contamination , confusion with field stars , and bias towards stars retaining protoplanetary disks , the spatial distributions of x - ray identified stars in populous young clusters should be excellent laboratories to explore their origins and dynamical evolution .",

    "<S> the cluster s stellar radial density profile shows two distinctive structures : a power - law cusp around hd  46150 that extends to @xmath7  pc , surrounded by an isothermal sphere extending out to 4  pc with core radius 1.2  pc . </S>",
    "<S> this double structure , combined with the absence of mass segregation , indicates that this 2  myr old cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> our results will strongly constrain models of the cluster formation process . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of x - ray selected @xmath5-excess disk stars and embedded stars is asymmetric with an apparent deficit towards the north . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) the fraction of x - ray - selected cluster members with @xmath5-band excesses caused by inner protoplanetary disks is 6% , slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimated from the flamingos study based on the nir - selected sample . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the high efficiency of x - ray surveys in locating disk - free weak - lined t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) x - ray luminosities for 24 stars earlier than b4 confirm the long - standing @xmath8 relation . </S>",
    "<S> the rosette ob x - ray spectra are soft and consistent with the standard model of small - scale shocks in the inner wind of a single massive star . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) about 50 intermediate - mass ( @xmath9  m@xmath0 ) cluster members are identified ; they exhibit a wide range of x - ray luminosities consistent with previously studied samples of herbig ae / be stars . </S>",
    "<S> their @xmath5-excess disk fraction is @xmath1010% , indicating that the herbig ae / be phenomenon is rare or short - lived . </S>"
