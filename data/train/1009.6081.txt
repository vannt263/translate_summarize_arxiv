    "the heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies have captured the center place in present day nuclear research .",
    "this is because of the several rare phenomena emerging at these incident energies and their utility in several other branches of the physics @xcite .",
    "the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) is hoped to be pindown via the liquid - gas transition , multi - fragmentation and anisotropic flow , such as directed and elliptic flows produced in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "such knowledge is not only of the interest in nuclear physics but is also useful in the understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as the evolution of early universe .",
    "one observable that has been used extensively for extracting the nuclear eos from heavy - ion collisions is the anisotropic flow of various particles .",
    "+ in recent years , the subject of anisotropic flow at intermediate energies has attracted increasing attention of the heavy - ion community .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is that anisotropic flow , @xcite is very sensitive to the early evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flow is defined as the azimuthal asymmetry in the particle distribution with respect to the reaction plane ( the plane spanned by the beam direction and impact parameter ) .",
    "this gives the magnitude of the asymmetry and is characterised by the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution @xcite of the detected particles at mid rapidities as + @xmath6 + here @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle between the transverse momentum of the particle and reaction plane .",
    "the first harmonic term describes the so - called directed flow which is the bounce - off of cold spectator matter in the reaction plane @xcite and the second harmonic term corresponds to the elliptical flow which is the squeeze out of the hot and compressed participant matter perpendicular to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fourier coefficients , @xmath8 are used to quantify this effect @xcite .",
    "these two observables together represent the anisotropic part of the transverse flow and appear only in the non - central heavy - ion collisions . the elliptical flow @xcite has been proven to be one of the most fruitful probes for extracting the equation of state ( eos ) and to study the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions that originates from the almond shape of the overlap zone and is produced due to the unequal pressure gradients i.e an anisotropy in the transverse momentum direction . the @xmath9 can also be expressed as + @xmath10   + where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the components of the momentum along the x and y - axis , respectively .",
    "+ the positive value of @xmath9 describes the eccentricity of an ellipse like distribution and indicates the in - plane enhancement of the particle emission , i.e. a rotational behaviour .",
    "note that isotropy of the space requires @xmath9 should vanish .",
    "obviously , zero value of the @xmath9 corresponds to an isotropic distribution in the transverse plane .",
    "since elliptical flow develops at a very early stage of the nuclear collision , it is an excellent tool to probe the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) under the extreme conditions of temperature and density .",
    "+ many theoretical and experimental efforts have been made in studying the collective transverse flow in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies @xcite . in 1982 , stocker _",
    "_ , were the first to predict the midrapidity emission perpendicular to the reaction plane @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "gyulassy , frankel , and stocker @xcite put forward the kinetic energy tensor to analyze the flow patterns .",
    "experimentally observed out - of - plane emission , termed as squeeze - out , was first observed by diogene collaboration @xcite .",
    "the plastic ball group at the bevalac in berkley were the first one to quantify the squeeze in symmetric systems . in their study ,",
    "@xmath13 collisions was studied at 400 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the transition from the in - plane to out - of - plane emission was first observed by the nautilus collaboration at ganil in 1994 using the reactions of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , many important develpments in this area e.g the dependencies of elliptical flow on the impact parameter and transverse momentum have been determined .",
    "these main features have been confirmed by the fopi , indra and aladin collaborations @xcite .",
    "the miniball / aladin collaboration also observed the onset of out - of plane emission in @xmath13 collisions at 100 mev / nucleon @xcite . in most of these studies ,",
    "@xmath15 reactions have been chosen @xcite .",
    "the elliptical flow at incident energies from tens to hundreds of mev / nucleon are determined by the complex interplay among expansion , rotation and the shadowing of spectators @xcite .",
    "both the mean field and two - body collision parts ( real and imaginary parts of g - matrix ) play an equal important role in this energy domain .",
    "the mean field plays a dominant role at low incident energies , and then gradually the two - body collision becomes dominant as the incident energy increases .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the process such as fusion , fission and cluster decay can be explained successfully using the real part of g - matrix @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the excitation function of elliptical flow , in this energy region , therefore , can provide useful information on the nature of nucleon - nucleon interaction related to the equation of state .",
    "interestingly , a systematic theoretical study of the elliptical flow for asymmetric systems is still very rare .",
    "moreover , the elliptical flow can also be exploited to understand the nature of hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we attempt to study the different aspects of elliptical flow @xmath9 for various asymmetric systems @xmath16 e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 within the framework of quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd)@xcite model .",
    "this model is used to generate the phase space of nucleons .",
    "the article is organized as follows : a brief description of the model is given in section ii .",
    "our results are discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section iv .",
    "the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model is a time - dependent many - body theoretical approach which is based on the molecular dynamics picture that treats nuclear correlations explicitly .",
    "the two dynamical ingredients of the model are the density - dependent mean field and the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross- section@xcite . in the qmd model , each nucleon is represented by a gaussian wave packet characterised by the time dependent parameters in space @xmath17 and in momentum @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "11 ) are taken from the ref .",
    "+ the different values of the compressibility in the skyrme force give possibility to look for the role of different equations of state termed as soft and hard equations of state .",
    "the inclusion of momentum dependent interactions in soft and hard equations of state are labeled as soft momentum dependent ( smd ) eos and hard momentum dependent ( hmd ) eos , respectively .",
    "the ( additional ) momentum dependence of the interaction generates extra repulsion during the evolution of the reaction which increases the collective flow and supresses the subthreshhold particle production @xcite .",
    "this effect is the largest during the initial phase of the reaction .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential is parametrized in terms of the nucleon - nucleon cross - section . as our present aim is to look for the role of different eos s , we use the energy dependent nn cross - section .",
    "a relativistic version of the model is also available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the qmd model is that it can explicitly represent the many body states of the system and thus contains the correlation effects .",
    "therefore , provides an important information about the collision dynamics .",
    "+ in this paper , the free nucleons and different fragments i.e. , light mass fragments ( lmfs)@xmath44 and intermediate mass fragments ( imfs)@xmath45 are selected to study the elliptical flow analysis .",
    "some studies have been carried out for elliptical flow involving heavier fragments @xcite .",
    "we perform a complete systematic study using the different asymmetric reactions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 at incident energies between 45 and 105 mev / nucleon .",
    "we have simulated these reactions over the full collision geometry starting from the central to peripheral one .",
    "the fragments are constructed within minimum spanning tree ( mst ) method @xcite .",
    "the mst method binds two nucleons in a fragment if their distance is less than 4 fm .",
    "the entire calculations are performed at final state that is 200 fm / c .",
    "we also note that several different models on clusterisation are also reported in recent publications @xcite . + in fig.1",

    "one can see a gaussian type behaviour quite similar to the one reported by colona and toro _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite .",
    "this gaussian type behaviour is integrated over the entire rapidity range .",
    "one also sees from the figure , that the elliptical flow of nucleons / lmfs / imf s is positive in the whole range of @xmath48 .",
    "there is a linear increase in the elliptical flow with transverse momentum upto certain incident energy .",
    "obviously , particles with larger momentum will escape the reaction zone earlier .",
    "after certain transverse momentum , it starts decreasing monotonically , which is due to the decrease in the number of particles in that @xmath48 range .",
    "one also notices that the peaks of gaussian shifts toward the lower value of @xmath48 for heavier fragments .",
    "the reason is that the emitted free and light charged particles can feel the role of mean - field directly , while the heavier fragments have weak sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it is also evident from the figure that the reactions under consideration have different system mass dependence as well as n / z ratios .",
    "+ moreover , the results are found to vary drastically with the change of equation of state . to make this point more clear",
    ", we have dislayed on the right hand side of the fig.1 , the transverse momentum dependence of elliptical flow using four different equations of state namely the soft , hard , soft momentum dependent ( smd ) , and hard momentum dependent ( hmd ) equations of state .",
    "for this analysis , we choose the reaction of ar+sc at @xmath47 = 0.5 and e = 95 mev / nucleon .",
    "we can see clear effect of the different equations of state in the production of light mass fragments ( lmf s ) .",
    "in contrary , very little change is observed in the case of free particles and intermediate mass fragments ( imf s ) .",
    "this is due to the different compressibility values for hard , hmd eos ( k= 380 mev ) , and soft , smd eos ( k= 200 mev ) .",
    "moreover , the role of momentum dependent interactions ( mdi ) is also important . because of the repulsive nature of momentum dependent interactions , which leads to the suppression of binary collisions , less squeeze - out",
    "is observed in the presence of momentum dependent interactions ( smd , hmd ) compared to the static one ( s , h ) @xcite . since the figure is plotted at all rapidities , so the less positive value of elliptical flow is obtained in the presence of momentum dependent interactions .",

    "the value of @xmath9 increases more rapidly with impact parameter .",
    "this is due to the azimuthal anisotropy , that becomes larger with the impact parameter and reduces with the beam energy . for semi- central collisions ,",
    "less number of nucleons participate in the collision process and hence lead to more elliptical flow . since the production of the intermediate mass fragments is due to the spectator part , the elliptical flow is stronger for the heavier fragments compared to the lighter colliding nuclei .",

    "the reason for this is that the pressure produced by the coulomb interactions increases with the system size , while , decreases with the impact parameter .",
    "the decrease with impact parameter is due to the decrease of the participant zone .",

    "the comparison has been done at the same impact parameter as suggested by magestro @xcite after correction .",
    "the general behavior of the elliptical flow calculated with different eos s resembles .",
    "the elliptical flow evolves from a preferential in - plane ( rotational like ) emission ( @xmath55 ) , to the out - of - plane ( squeeze - out ) emission ( @xmath56 ) , with an increase of the incident energies .",
    "the elliptical flow decreases with the incident energy .",
    "the decrease in elliptical flow is sharp at smaller incident energies ( upto 65 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "this starts saturating at higher incident energies .",
    "in other words , the elliptical shape of nuclear flow dominates the physics at low incident energies .",
    "one can see from the figure that the transition energies at which the elliptical flow parameter @xmath9 changes sign from positive to negative are different for different equations of state .",
    "the transition from the in - plane emission to out - of plane occurs because the mean - field that contributes to the formation of the compound nucleus becomes less important . at the same time",
    ", the collective expansion process ( based on the nucleon - nucleon scattering ) starts dominating .",
    "the competition between the mean - field and the nucleon - nucleon collisions strongly depends on the effective interaction , which leads to the divergence of the transition energies calculated with different equations of state .",
    "clearly the hard eos provides stronger pressure that leads to a stronger out - of plane emission and thus to the smaller transition energy .",
    "the difference of elliptical flow between all eos s decreases as we move towards the higher incident energies ( e = 85 to 105 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "the elliptical flow calculated with hard equation of state agrees with the @xmath54 array experimental data . from our analysis",

    "<S> we here present the results of elliptical flow for the collision of different asymmetric nuclei ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) by using the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> general features of elliptical flow are investigated with the help of theoretical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are performed at different beam energies between 40 and 105 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> a significant change can be seen from in - plane to out - of - plane elliptical flow of different fragments with incident energy . a comparison with experimental data is also made . </S>",
    "<S> further , we predict , for the first time that , elliptical flow for different kind of fragments follow power law dependence @xmath4 c@xmath5 for asymmetric systems . + </S>"
