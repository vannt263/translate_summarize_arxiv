    "we study here different compositions of point processes , say @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are mutually independent and can possibly be birth , death or homogeneous poisson processes .",
    "these compositions arise in the analysis of different population models , when , in some specific experimental circumstances , the time @xmath4 must be replaced by a stochastic process @xmath5 @xmath6 in our analysis we concentrate our attention on the case where the time increments are unit - valued and thus are properly represented by point processes , such as linear birth and poisson processes . in these cases the composed process can be regarded as a randomly sampled population model .",
    "the simplest case of the composition of two independent homogeneous poisson processes ( with different rates ) has been already studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the iterated poisson process has been considered in @xcite .",
    "our investigation concentrates here on the distribution of the first - passage times , i.e.@xmath7which , in this context , substantially differ from the upcrossing and downcrossing times , i.e.@xmath8indeed , the composed processes @xmath9 jump over ( resp . under ) any level @xmath10 with positive probability .",
    "the hitting probabilities @xmath11 display different behaviors .",
    "for example , for the iterated birth process @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 independent linear birth processes ) , the probabilities @xmath11 attain their maximal value at @xmath14 . in the linear death process at poisson distributed time the hitting probabilities display an oscillating behavior , which can be perceived when the initial size of the population is sufficiently large .",
    "furthermore , we observe that in all the cases considered here the hitting probabilities @xmath11 depend only on the parameter of the outer process",
    ".    moreover , the processes @xmath9 display sample paths with upward or downward jumps of arbitrary size . other models with the same feature , such as the space - fractional poisson processes or , in general , time - changed poisson processes with berntein subordinators , have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "multiple jumps are also displayed by the generalized fractional birth processes studied in @xcite .",
    "as in this last work , this property is reflected in the form of the equation governing the state probabilities @xmath15 @xmath16 where the time derivative @xmath17 is shown to depend , also here , on all @xmath18 , for @xmath19    in particular , our analysis concerns the following specific cases :    * @xmath20 @xmath21(section 3 ) * @xmath22 @xmath21(section 4 ) * @xmath23 @xmath21(section 5 ) * @xmath24 @xmath21(section 6 ) ,    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are independent linear birth ( yule - furry ) processes , @xmath27 is the homogeneous poisson process , @xmath28 is the linear death process and @xmath29 is the sublinear death process .",
    "the latter is characterized by the fact that the probability of a further death in @xmath30 depends on the number of deaths recorded up to time @xmath4 ( unlike the linear case where this probability depends on the number of surviving individuals ) .",
    "the sublinear birth process was introduced in don , while the sublinear death process has been investigated in @xcite , in a fractional context .",
    "the processes considered here can be useful to model the population evolution sampled at poisson times",
    ". the iterated birth process can be more appropriate for the cases where the time separating occurrences is rapidly decreasing .",
    "this structure can be applied , for example , in some experimental studies of diseases or epidemic diffusions .",
    "time - changed birth processes of different forms have been studied in din and @xcite , with various applications to finance .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the iterated birth process of which we examine the first - passage time distributions and the hitting probabilities . furthermore , linear birth processes , linear and sublinear death processes at poisson times are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the hitting times in all cases and examine their long - range behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> the time - changed population models considered here display upward ( birth process ) and downward jumps ( death processes ) of arbitrary size and , for this reason , can be adopted as adequate models in ecology , epidemics and finance situations , under stress conditions .    * keywords and phrases * : yule - furry process , linear and sublinear death processes , hitting times , extinction probabilities , first - passage times , stirling numbers , bell polynomials .    _ </S>",
