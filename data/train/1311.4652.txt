    "the underlying mechanism for ff pairing is not essential in our interferometer .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",

    "thus , the phase difference @xmath24 between the two channels due to the phase modulation in the ff superconductor can be registered accurately by the reflected hole , leading to the interference when the hole paths finally get combined at the left channel @xmath21 . as a result",
    ", a total ar probability proportional to @xmath25 is expected for a symmetric y - junction .",
    "it is interesting to note that the picture is resemblant to the well - known aharonov - bohm interferometer , if we sketch the hole paths as a mirror symmetry of the electron paths about the ns interfaces in fig . [",

    "multiple scatterings at the y - junction , and barriers may exist at the ns interfaces .",
    "these effects may complicate the interference between the two channels , however , as shown below , the basic idea and qualitative results still hold .",
    "in order to find the total ar amplitude in channel 0 , we first need to find the scattering coefficients at the ns interfaces and then combine them with the scattering matrix at the y - junction . in fig .",

    "the effects due to the land @xmath34-factor and the spin - orbit coupling are assumed to be negligible in the nanowires , so that the bdg equation is written in a @xmath35 form with the external magnetic field being absent , which although is necessary for the ff superconductor . due to the proximity effect with an ff superconductor ,",
    "a finite pair potential is induced in the nanowire , which is represented by the step function @xmath36 with the phase @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the vertical ordinate of the channel @xmath30 .",
    "a standard green function approach shows that , although the induced pairing strength @xmath2 may be smaller than that in the bulk , the phase modulation of the order parameter in the ff superconductor is always accurately registered by the induced pair potential in the nanowire ( see appendix 1 for details ) .",
