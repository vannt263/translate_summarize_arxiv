    "the hubbard hamiltonian@xcite is a basic model for studying correlated electrons . despite its simple form",
    "it is very difficult to solve , the main complication arising from the fact that the interaction term is diagonal in real space , while the kinetic energy is simple in momentum space . except for special cases , namely the one@xcite and the infinite - dimensional@xcite hubbard model ,",
    "no exact solutions are known . for other dimensions we thus have to use approximate methods .",
    "the variational method has the advantage of being applicable over the whole range of interaction strength . naturally , the quality of variational calculations depends critically on the trial function and on our ability to optimize its parameters .",
    "a good trial function has to balance the opposing tendencies of the kinetic- and the interaction term .",
    "gutzwiller proposed such a wavefunction for the hubbard model , the gutzwiller wavefunction ( gwf).@xcite it introduces correlations into a slater determinant by means of a correlation factor that is local in configuration space . like the jastrow factor in continuum - space wavefunctions,@xcite it works by reducing the weight of configurations with large potential energy .",
    "unfortunately , also the gwf is hard to treat exactly .",
    "again , analytical results have only been obtained in one dimension,@xcite and in infinite dimensions,@xcite where the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) becomes exact.@xcite for @xmath0 we have to resort to numerical methods like variational monte carlo ( vmc).@xcite another variational method that has been developed recently is fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fndmc ) for fermions on a lattice.@xcite like variational monte carlo it uses a trial wavefunction , but the results are much closer to the exact ground state and depend much less on the trial wavefunction .",
    "since these monte carlo methods work in configuration space it is straightforward to implement trial functions with more correlation factors .",
    "such generalized gutzwiller - type wavefunctions@xcite that include for example correlations between empty and doubly occupied sites give improvements over the original gutzwiller wavefunction.@xcite    our goal is to optimize the parameters in gutzwiller - type wavefunctions in the framework of quantum monte carlo calculations .",
    "general methods for achieving this are correlated sampling@xcite or the recently developed stochastic gradient approximation.@xcite exploiting the particular form of gutzwiller wavefunctions , we find a different approach , which is equivalent to correlated sampling : we observe that expectation values can be rewritten as the quotient of two polynomials ( i.e.  a rational function ) in the gutzwiller parameters . estimating the coefficients of these polynomials in a single monte carlo run , we can then easily minimize the energy expectation value by finding the minimum of the corresponding rational function .",
    "the implementation of this idea in variational monte carlo is described in section [ vmc ] .",
    "we show how the optimization works in practice and give some applications . in sec .",
    "[ dmc ] the optimization method is adapted to work also in fixed - node diffusion monte carlo .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of changing the fixed - node constraint in fndmc .",
    "applications and results for wavefunctions with more parameters are given in sec .",
    "to be specific , we consider the hubbard model @xmath1 where @xmath2 creates an electron with spin @xmath3 on site @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the sum in the kinetic term is over nearest - neighbor pairs , and the hopping matrix element is used as the energy scale , i.e.  @xmath6 . the interaction term in ( [ hubbardhamil ] )",
    "may also be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the operator that counts the number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "the gutzwiller wavefunction is then given by @xmath9    = 2.5 in = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    2 where @xmath10 is the gutzwiller parameter and @xmath11 is the ground state wavefunction of the non - interacting system ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the gutzwiller factor builds correlations into the slater determinant by reducing the weight of configurations with large interaction energy , i.e.  large number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "this is visualized in fig .",
    "[ suppress ] . in the following",
    "we briefly review the formalism of variational monte carlo for lattice systems and discuss a way to improve the efficiency of the simulation , especially for systems with strong correlation .",
    "then we introduce the method for optimizing the gutzwiller parameter in a vmc calculation .      to calculate the energy expectation value for the gutzwiller wavefunction we have to perform a sum over all configurations @xmath13 : @xmath14 where we have introduced the local energy for a configuration @xmath13 : @xmath15 the prime in the last equation indicates that the sum is restricted to configurations @xmath16 that are connected with @xmath13 by the hamiltonian , i.e.   configurations that can be reached from @xmath13 by hopping one electron to a nearest - neighbor site .",
    "we call such configurations nearest - neighbors in configuration space .    since the number of configurations grows combinatorially with system - size , the sums in ( [ evar ] )",
    "can in general only be performed for very small systems . for larger problems we can use monte carlo",
    "the idea is to perform a random walk in the space of configurations , with transition probabilities @xmath17 chosen such that the configurations @xmath18 in the random walk have the probability distribution function @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath20 where the last equality holds within statistical error - bars .",
    "the transition probabilities are given by @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath22 being the maximum number of possible transitions.@xcite this choice fulfills detailed balance @xmath23 for ergodicity it is sufficient to consider only transitions between nearest neighboring configurations .",
    "the standard prescription is then to propose a transition @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 and accept it with probability @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "this works well for @xmath27 not too large . in strongly correlated systems , however , the random walk will stay for long times in configurations with a small number of double occupancies @xmath28 , since most of the proposed moves will increase @xmath29 and hence be rejected with probability @xmath30.@xcite there is , however , a way to integrate the time the walk stays in a given configuration out . to see how this works ,",
    "we first observe that for the local energy ( [ eloc ] ) the ratio of the wavefunctions for all transitions induced by the hamiltonian have to be calculated .",
    "this in turn means that we also know all transition probabilities @xmath17 .",
    "we can therefore eliminate any rejection ( i.  e.  make the acceptance ratio equal to one ) by proposing moves with probabilities @xmath31 checking detailed balance ( [ detailedbalance ] ) we find that now we are sampling configurations @xmath32 from the probability distribution function @xmath33 . to compensate for this",
    "we assign a weight @xmath34 to each configuration @xmath13 .",
    "the energy expectation value is then , within statistical error - bars , given by @xmath35 the above method is quite efficient since it ensures that in every monte carlo step a new configuration is visited . in other words ,",
    "the acceptance ratio is one . instead of staying in a configuration where @xmath36 is large ,",
    "this configuration is weighted with the expectation value of the number of times the simple metropolis algorithm would stay there .",
    "this is particularly convenient for simulations of systems with strong correlations : instead of having to do longer and longer runs as @xmath27 is increased , the above method produces , for a fixed number of monte carlo steps , results with comparable error - bars .",
    "we now turn to the problem of minimizing the energy expectation value ( [ evar ] ) as a function of the variational parameters in the trial function . to this end",
    "we could simply perform independent vmc calculations for a set of different parameters .",
    "it is , however , difficult to compare the energies from independent calculations since each vmc result comes with its own statistical errors .",
    "this problem can be avoided with correlated sampling.@xcite the idea is to use the same random walk in calculating the expectation value for different trial functions .",
    "this reduces the relative errors and hence makes it easier to find the minimum .",
    "let us assume then that we have generated a random walk @xmath37 for the trial function @xmath36 . using the _ same _ random walk",
    ", we can also estimate the energy expectation value ( [ evmc ] ) for a different trial function @xmath38 . to do so we have to compensate for the fact that the configurations have the probability distribution @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 by introducing reweighting factors @xmath41 likewise , ( [ evmcwght ] ) is reweighted into @xmath42",
    "also the local energy @xmath43 can be rewritten to contain the new trial function only in ratios with the old one . for gutzwiller functions",
    "this implies a drastic simplification .",
    "since they differ only in the gutzwiller factor , the slater determinants cancel , leaving only powers @xmath44 : @xmath45    = 2.7 in    and @xmath46 since the number of doubly occupied sites @xmath28 for a configuration @xmath13 is an _ integer _ , we can then rearrange the sums in ( [ gcorr ] ) and ( [ gloc ] ) into polynomials in @xmath47 .",
    "the energy expectation value for any gutzwiller parameter @xmath48 is then given by a rational function in the variable @xmath47 , where the coefficients only depend on the fixed trial function @xmath49 .",
    "it is then clear how we proceed to optimize the gutzwiller parameter in variational monte carlo .",
    "we first pick a reasonable @xmath50 and perform a vmc run for @xmath49 during which we also estimate the coefficients of the above polynomials .",
    "we can then easily calculate @xmath51 by evaluating the rational function in @xmath47 .",
    "since there are typically only of the order of a few tens non - vanishing coefficients ( cf .  the distribution of weights shown in fig .",
    "[ suppress ] ) , this is a very efficient process .    figure [ vmccorrsmpl ] shows how the method works in practice .",
    "although we deliberately picked a bad starting point we still find the right minimum .",
    "the correlated sampling curves even seem to coincide within the statistical errors .",
    "this is , however , not true for the whole range of gutzwiller parameters .",
    "when @xmath48 differs too much from @xmath50 , the method breaks down . to understand this we again turn to fig .",
    "[ suppress ] .",
    "we see that most configurations in a random walk generated with , say , @xmath52 will have about @xmath53 doubly occupied sites . in the monte carlo",
    "run we therefore sample the coefficients for @xmath54 best while the statistics for much larger or smaller powers is poor .",
    "but it is exactly these poorly sampled coefficients that we need in calculating the energy expectation value for trial functions with @xmath48 much different from @xmath50 .",
    "we can thus use the overlap of the wavefunctions @xmath55 as a measure for the reliability of the calculated energy @xmath51 . like the energy expectation value itself",
    ", it can be recast in the form of a rational function , the coefficients of which can be sampled during the vmc run : @xmath56 to get a feeling for the overlap as a function of @xmath48 for fixed @xmath50 , we can make a rough estimate using the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "expanding around @xmath50 we find that the overlap looks like a gaussian : @xmath57 $ ] , with m the number of lattice sites .",
    "as expected , for @xmath50 and @xmath48 fixed , the overlap goes to zero exponentially with system size .",
    "@xmath58 is a function of @xmath50 and the filling .",
    "it generally decreases with @xmath50 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ suppress ] as for small @xmath50 the weights are peaked more sharply than for larger gutzwiller parameters . for half filling the width of the gaussian",
    "is given by @xmath59 .",
    "the relation between the overlap and the reliability of the expression ( [ gcorr ] ) can best be seen by comparing vmc calculations to exact energies @xmath60 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ metzner ] .",
    "there we compare the results of vmc calculations for finite hubbard chains of different size with the exact result for the infinite chain.@xcite clearly there are systematic errors in the energy coming from finite size effects in the vmc calculations . but apart from that we find a remarkable agreement between the exact energy @xmath60 and the result of the correlated sampling , even for fairly small overlaps .",
    "it is also evident from the figure that the overlap for given @xmath50 and @xmath48 decreases with system size , making optimizations more and more difficult , the larger the system .",
    "we finally mention some straightforward modifications of the scheme we have described above .",
    "there are situations where it is more appropriate to minimize the variance in the local energy @xmath61 rather than the energy @xmath60.@xcite since the variance can also be rewritten in terms of a rational function in @xmath47 , variance optimization can be implemented in much the same way as the energy minimization that we have described here .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the method is not restricted to the plain gutzwiller wavefunction but can be generalized to trial functions with more correlation factors of the type @xmath62 .",
    "as long as the correlation function @xmath63 is integer - valued on the space of configurations , expectation values for such trial functions can still be rewritten    = 3.2 in    as rational functions .",
    "the only difference to the simpler case described above is that now the rational function is multivariate , reflecting the fact that there is more than one variational parameter .",
    "we now turn to the optimization of the trial function in fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fndmc ) . in this method",
    "the ground state wavefunction of a given hamiltonian is projected out from a trial function by repeated application of a suitable operator .",
    "for fermion systems this approach is plagued by the infamous sign - problem , which causes an exponential decay of the signal - to - noise ratio during a simulation .",
    "one approach to evade this problem is to use a trial function to fix the nodes of the wavefunctions .",
    "this is the fixed - node approximation , which gives variational estimates of the ground state energy as a function of the trial function .",
    "clearly a change in the jastrow factor , will not change the nodes of the trial function .",
    "hence one would expect the fndmc results to be independent of such changes .",
    "this is actually true for systems in continuum - space.@xcite for lattice problems , the fixed - node approximation is somewhat more subtle , and , as it turns out , results also depend on the gutzwiller parameters.@xcite since fixed - node diffusion monte carlo , like vmc , is a variational method , it is then important to optimize the gutzwiller factors .",
    "this optimization can again be done using correlated sampling . as in the preceeding section ,",
    "we can rewrite the expression for the energy as a function of the gutzwiller parameter in terms of a ratio of polynomials .",
    "now , however , the order of the polynomials is not a fixed , small number but increases with the number of monte carlo steps .",
    "it is therefore not feasible to sample the coefficients directly , as we did above .",
    "we will first briefly review the aspects of fixed - node diffusion monte carlo that are important for implementing an optimization scheme for gutzwiller parameters , then describe how to perform the optimization , and finally show how the method works in practice . for more in - depth discussions and some applications of the fndmc method",
    "see , e.g. , refs .   .",
    "diffusion monte carlo @xcite allows us , in principle , to sample the true ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath64 .",
    "the basic idea is to use a projection operator which has the lowest eigenstate as a fixed point . for a lattice problem , where the spectrum is bounded @xmath65 $ ]",
    ", the projection is given by @xmath66\\;|\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle , \\ ] ] starting with @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 and @xmath69 has a non - vanishing overlap with the ground state , the above iteration converges to @xmath70 .",
    "there is no time - step error involved .",
    "because of the prohibitively large dimension of the many - body hilbert space , the matrix - vector product in ( [ proj ] ) can not be done exactly .",
    "instead , we rewrite the equation in configuration space @xmath71 and perform the propagation in a stochastic sense : @xmath72 is represented by an ensemble of configurations @xmath13 with weights @xmath73 .",
    "the transition matrix element @xmath74 is rewritten as a transition probability @xmath17 times a normalization factor @xmath75 .",
    "the iteration ( [ iter ] ) is then performed stochastically as follows : for each @xmath13 we pick a new configuration @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 and multiply its weight by @xmath75 .",
    "then the new ensemble of configurations @xmath16 with their respective weights represents @xmath76 .",
    "importance sampling decisively improves the efficiency of this process by replacing @xmath74 with @xmath77 so that transitions from configurations where the trial function is small to configurations with large trial function are enhanced .",
    "( [ iter ] ) then takes the form @xmath78 i.e.  the ensemble of configurations now represents the product @xmath79 , and the transition probabilities are given by @xmath80 with @xmath81\\,\\sum_{r '' } |g(r'',r)|$ ] absorbing the sign of @xmath82 and ensuring normalization . after a large number @xmath83 of iterations the ground state energy",
    "is then given by the mixed estimator @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "as long as the evolution operator has only non - negative matrix elements @xmath82 , all weights @xmath73 will be positive .",
    "if , however , @xmath86 has negative matrix elements there will be both configurations with positive and negative weight .",
    "their contributions to the estimator ( [ mixedest ] ) tend to cancel so that eventually the statistical error dominates , rendering the simulation useless .",
    "this is the infamous sign problem .",
    "a straightforward way to get rid of the sign problem is to remove the offending matrix elements from the hamiltonian , thus defining a new hamiltonian @xmath87 by @xmath88 for each off - diagonal element @xmath89 that has been removed , a term is added to the diagonal : @xmath90 this is the fixed - node approximation for lattice hamiltonians introduced in ref .  .",
    "@xmath87 is by construction free of the sign problem and variational , i.e.  @xmath91 , and if if @xmath92 for all @xmath13 , @xmath16 with @xmath93 the method is exact .",
    "fixed - node diffusion monte carlo for a lattice hamiltonian thus means that we choose a trial function from which we construct an effective hamiltonian , the ground state of which is determined by diffusion monte carlo . from the equations defining @xmath87 we can then understand how the fixed - node results depend on the trial function .",
    "clearly , the off diagonal elements ( [ offdiag ] ) only depend on the sign of the trial function .",
    "since the gutzwiller term is just a non - negative prefactor , a change of @xmath50 will not affect these matrix elements .",
    "on the other hand , the diagonal elements @xmath94 can contain ratios of the trial function on neighboring configurations . in many cases",
    "these configurations will differ in the number of doubly occupied sites .",
    "then the gutzwiller terms will not cancel and the diagonal element of the effective hamiltonian will depend on the gutzwiller factor .",
    "we are now in the position to describe how we can optimize @xmath36 or , equivalently , optimize @xmath87 using correlated sampling .",
    "the idea is again to calculate the energy for a modified hamiltonian @xmath95 using a random walk generated for the original hamiltonian @xmath87 . to find the reweighting factors involved in the calculation we rewrite the mixed estimator @xmath96 at first glance it looks like the local energy @xmath43 has to be calculated for @xmath95 , but keeping track of the sign - flip terms in the diagonal of the effective hamiltonian we find @xmath97 which is just the local energy for the original hamiltonian",
    "hence , the local energy can be dealt with as in variational monte carlo , cf .",
    "( [ gloc ] ) .    correlated sampling now means that in the expression ( [ tildemixed ] ) for the mixed estimator we do monte carlo for the terms @xmath98 instead of @xmath99 .",
    "the reweighting factors are thus given by @xmath100    reintroducing the plain ( not importance - sampled ) projection operator @xmath101 , we can rewrite the reweighting factor for a simple gutzwiller wavefunction into @xmath102 with the ratio @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105    \\over    1-\\tau\\left[\\sum\\limits_{r'\\;sf } { \\psi_t(r')\\over\\psi_t(r ) }                     \\langle r'|h|r\\rangle   - e_0\\right ]   } \\ ] ] with @xmath106 .",
    "this expression is again ( as in variational monte carlo ) a low order polynomial in @xmath47 .",
    "the reweighting factor is , however , a product of    = 3.1 in    many such polynomials , therefore the order of the polynomial representing ( [ reweightdmc ] ) increases with the number @xmath83 of monte carlo steps .",
    "it is therefore not practical to directly estimate the ever increasing number of coefficients for the reweighting factor .",
    "but since we still can easily calculate the coefficients for the factors ( [ rewf ] ) we may use them to evaluate the mixed estimator @xmath107 in each iteration on a set of _ predefined _ values @xmath108 of the gutzwiller parameter .    to see how the method works in practice we look at the same system as in fig .",
    "[ vmccorrsmpl ] : @xmath109 electrons on a @xmath110 lattice , with @xmath111 .",
    "figure [ dmcs ] shows the result of independent fndmc runs and the corresponding correlated sampling results .",
    "we see that our method gives good predictions of the optimum gutzwiller parameter , even for runs with trial functions that are quite far from optimum . comparing with variational monte carlo",
    ", we first notice that the variational energy in fndmc is substantially lower ( by @xmath112 ) .",
    "we furthermore see that in the fixed - node method there is a pronounced minimum in the energy as a function of the gutzwiller parameter , although the energy dependence is much smaller than in variational monte carlo .",
    "this is to be expected since in fndmc only certain features of the trial function ( namely the ratio of the trial function across the nodes ) enter the calculation .",
    "the situation is , however , different from the fixed - node method for wavefunctions defined in continuum - space , for which changing the jastrow factor does not change the position of the nodal surfaces and hence also does not systematically change the result of the fixed - node calculation . we finally notice that the optimum gutzwiller parameter for fndmc is slightly smaller than that obtained from vmc .",
    "we have made practical use of the method for optimizing gutzwiller parameters in our investigations of the doped fullerides . in this context",
    "we work with a hubbard - like hamiltonian that describes the conduction electrons in the three - fold degenerate @xmath113 band : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the hopping integral between orbital @xmath83 of the molecule on site @xmath4 and orbital @xmath116 of molecule @xmath117 , and @xmath27 is the coulomb interaction for electrons on the same molecule . for more details on the underlying physics",

    "charge the term @xmath122 is added to the hamiltonian ( [ c60hamil ] ) . in the spirit of the gutzwiller ansatz",
    "we correspondingly add a second gutzwiller factor to the wavefunction ( [ gwfc60 ] ) that reflects the additional interaction term @xmath123 : @xmath124 finding the best gutzwiller parameters is now a two dimensional optimization problem .",

    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ screen ] shows the result of the optimization , both in variational and in fixed - node diffusion monte carlo , for a cluster of 64 c@xmath126 molecules in an fcc arrangement ( periodic boundary conditions ) resembling k@xmath127c@xmath126 with a test charge @xmath128 . in practice",
    "we first optimize the parameters in variational monte carlo .",
    "we then use the optimum vmc parameters as starting points for the optimization in the more time consuming fixed - node diffusion monte carlo calculations .      in the traditional gutzwiller ansatz ,",
    "the slater determinant @xmath119 is the ground state wavefunction of the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "this is , however , not necessarily the best choice .",
    "an alternative would be to use the slater determinant @xmath129 from solving the interacting problem in hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we can even interpolate between the two extremes by doing a hartree - fock calculation with a fictitious hubbard interaction @xmath130 to obtain slater determinants @xmath131 .",
    "yet another family of slater determinants @xmath132 can be obtained from solving the non - interacting hamiltonian with an added staggered magnetic field , which lets us control the antiferromagnetic character of the trial function .",
    "although optimizing parameters in the slater determinant can not be done with the method described in the preceeding sections , the cheap optimization of the gutzwiller factors makes it possible to optimize the overall trial function without too much effort .      introducing a staggered magnetic field",
    "we can construct slater determinants by solving the non - interacting hamiltonian with an added zeeman term . to be specific , we consider k@xmath127c@xmath126 which has a half - filled @xmath113-band .",
    "since k@xmath127c@xmath126 crystallizes in an fcc lattice , antiferromagnetism is frustrated and the definition of a staggered magnetic field is not unique .",
    "we split the fcc lattice into two sublattices @xmath133 and @xmath134 such that the frustration is minimized .",
    "the zeeman term is then given by @xmath135\\ ] ] with @xmath136 if @xmath137 and @xmath138 if @xmath139 .",
    "it effectively introduces an on - site energy which , on the same site , has opposite sign for the two spin orientations , and , for the same spin orientation , has opposite sign on the two sublattices .",
    "therefore , hopping to neighboring sites on different sublattices involves an energy cost of twice the zeeman energy . the staggered magnetic field",
    "thus not only induces antiferromagnetic order in the slater determinant but also serves to localize the electrons .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the optimum gutzwiller parameter is much larger for slater determinants constructed from a hamiltonian with large @xmath140 than for paramagnetic slater determinants .",
    "varying @xmath140 then interpolates between paramagnetic / itinerant and antiferromagnetic / localized wavefunctions .",
    "the energy expectation values for such trial functions as calculated in variational monte carlo are shown in fig .",
    "[ stagger_plot ] .",
    "it shows @xmath141 as a function of the antiferromagnetic correlation @xmath142 where the sum is over the @xmath22 nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath143 is a monotonous function of @xmath140 . for each different value of the hubbard interaction @xmath27",
    "we find a curve with two minima .",
    "one minimum is realized for the non - magnetic ( @xmath144 ) trial function .",
    "the energy as a function of @xmath27 scales roughly like @xmath145 , as predicted by the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "the second minimum is in the antiferromagnetic / localized region and scales roughly like @xmath146 , as expected . for small @xmath27",
    "the non - magnetic state is more favorable , while for large @xmath27 the localized slater determinant gives lower variational energies .",
    "the crossover is at @xmath147 ( dotted line ) and resembles a first order phase transition .",
    "an alternative method for constructing slater determinants is to use the interacting hamiltonian with the    = 3.0 in    physical hubbard interaction @xmath27 replaced by a parameter @xmath130 and solve it in hartree - fock approximation . in practice",
    "this is done by simply doing an unrestricted self - consistent calculation for the finite , periodic clusters under consideration , starting from some charge- and spin - density that breaks the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is well known that hartree - fock favors the antiferromagnetic mott insulator , predicting a mott transition at much too small values @xmath148 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that good trial functions are obtained for values of @xmath130 considerably smaller than @xmath27 . for @xmath130 close to zero the slater determinant",
    "has metallic character , while for somewhat larger @xmath130 there is a metal - insulator transition .",
    "figure [ u0_plot ] shows the energy as a function of @xmath130 for the model of k@xmath127c@xmath126 .",
    "we find that the results of variational monte carlo depend quite strongly on the parameter @xmath130 .",
    "as expected , for fixed hubbard interaction @xmath27 there is a transition from the paramagnetic region for small @xmath130 to a region where the trial function is antiferromagnetic . in fixed - node diffusion monte carlo energies",
    "are overall lowered and the dependence on the trial function is much weaker .",
    "it seems that here mainly the character ( paramagnetic / antiferromagnetic ) of the trial function matters . for small @xmath27 trial functions with small @xmath130",
    "give lower energy , while for large @xmath27 trial functions with larger @xmath130 are favorable .",

    "we have presented a convenient and reliable method for optimizing gutzwiller - type trial functions in monte carlo calculations .",
    "the method is based on the observation that the expressions for correlated sampling can be rewritten in terms of polynomials in the gutzwiller parameters .",
    "the method can be used both in variational and fixed - node diffusion monte carlo . because of its reliability and speed it makes optimizing gutzwiller parameters essentially an automatic process .",
    "this is especially convenient when dealing with trial functions that have several gutzwiller parameters as in the example on the dielectric screening in k@xmath127c@xmath126 . given that optimizing the gutzwiller parameters is quick and easy we can then focus on optimizing the slater determinant .",
