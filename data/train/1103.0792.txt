    "<S> we use a coarse - grained molecular model to study the self - assembly process of complexes of cationic and neutral lipids with dna molecules ( `` lipoplexes '' ) - a promising nonviral carrier of dna for gene therapy . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the resulting structures through direct visualization of the molecular arrangements and through calculations of the corresponding scattering plots . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach provides a means for comparison with published data from x - ray scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with experimental results , we find that upon increasing the stiffness of the lipid material , the system tends to form lamellar structures . </S>",
    "<S> two characteristic distances can be extracted from the scattering plots of lamellar complexes - the lamellar ( interlayer ) spacing and the dna - spacing within each layer . </S>",
    "<S> we find a remarkable agreement between the computed values of these two quantities and the experimental data [ j. o. rdler , i. koltover , t. salditt and c. r. safinya , _ science _ , 1997 , * 275 * 810 - 814 ] over the entire range of mole fractions of charged lipids ( cls ) studied experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> a visual inspection of the simulated systems reveals that , for very high fractions of cls , disordered structures consisting of dna molecules bound to small membrane fragments are spontaneously formed . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction plots of these non - lamellar disordered complexes appear very similar to that of the lamellar structure , which makes the interpretation of the x - ray data ambiguous </S>",
    "<S> . the loss of lamellar order may be the origin of the observed increase in the efficiency of lipoplexes as gene delivery vectors at high charge densities .    </S>",
    "<S> when dna molecules are mixed with neutral and cationic lipids ( cls ) in an aqueous environment , they spontaneously aggregate to form macromolecular complexes called `` lipoplexes '' . </S>",
    "<S> these complexes have attracted much attention over the past two decades because of their potential use as nonviral transfection vectors in gene therapy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transfection is a two - stage process involving adsorption and entry ( via endocytosis ) of the lipoplex into the cell , followed by the release of the dna to the cytoplasm and delivery to the nucleus , which makes the dna available for expression @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cl - dna complexes exhibit low toxicity and nonimmunogenicity , but their transfection efficiency ( te ) remains low compared to that of viral vectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has spurred an intense research activity aimed at enhancing te . </S>",
    "<S> recognizing that the structure of cl - dna complexes may strongly influence their function and te , much of the effort in theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms governing complex formation , structure , and phase behavior . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction experiments have revealed that cl - dna complexes exist in a variety of mesoscopic structures . </S>",
    "<S> these structures include : ( i ) a multilamellar phase where dna monolayers are intercalated between lipid bilayers ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , and ( ii ) the inverted hexagonal phase with dna encapsulated within monolayers tubes and arranged on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the major advantages of lipoplexes over viral capsids is their ease of preparation and their almost unlimited dna - carrying capacity , which stem from the fact that the vector is formed by spontaneous self - assembly in aqueous solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic attraction between the anionic dna and the cls along with the entropic gain associated with the release of tightly bound counterions from the cls and dna are the driving forces for the formation of a complex . in a recent publication </S>",
    "<S> , we reported on coarse - grained ( cg ) simulations of self - assembly of cl - dna complexes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated , in agreement with previous theoretical studies and x - ray scattering experiments @xcite , that rigid membranes tend to form lamellar complexes . </S>",
    "<S> for soft membranes , the preferred geometry is that of the inverted hexagonal phase . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations also revealed that the phase diagram of the cl - dna complexes is quite rich and includes , in addition to the lamellar and inverted hexagonal complexes , several other disordered structures with distinct configurational characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we also found a new ordered phase , which has thus far not been observed experimentally , where dna rods and cylindrical micelles form a 2d square lattice analogous to the 3d cubic nacl - type structure . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the computed self - assembled structures was based on simulation images and on the calculation of the fourier transform of the dna positions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform provides a quantitative measure for how the simulated structures would appear in x - ray scattering experiments . to achieve a better comparison with the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , one should also consider the contribution of the lipids to the scattered intensity . by plotting the separate contributions of each component ( something which can not be done experimentally ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can dissect the information displayed in the scattering plots .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the scattering intensity plots ( the square of the fourier transform averaged of all angles @xcite ) of the lamellar complexes , which are formed in our simulations when the dnas are mixed with stiff lipid material . </S>",
    "<S> the technical details of the model and the simulations have been presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in short , </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on the noguchi - takasu implicit solvent cg membrane model @xcite in which each lipid of length @xmath2 is represented by a linear rigid molecule @xcite consisting of three beads of diameter @xmath3 , one of which is hydrophilic and the other two are hydrophobic . </S>",
    "<S> the cls are modeled by associating the hydrophilic bead with a positive unit point charge , while the dna molecules are modeled as infinitely long parallel rigid rods of diameter @xmath4  with uniform charge density corresponding to -1.7e /  . </S>",
    "<S> the molecules interact via three types of interactions : ( i ) unscreened electrostatic interactions which are calculated using the lekner summation method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) short - range repulsive ( `` hard core '' ) potential . the bead - bead pair potential @xmath5 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) in ref .  @xcite , and the bead - dna potential @xmath6 . since the dna rods are strongly repelled from each other by electrostatic forces </S>",
    "<S> , there was no need to introduce an additional @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the noguchi - takasu hydrophobic interaction potential , given by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 5)-(6 ) in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lipids and the dna rods are initially randomly distributed within a given volume in the simulation box and , through molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations at constant temperature , we follow the evolution of the complexes under different conditions . as the objective of the simulations is to attain self - assembled structures representative of equilibrium , we simulate tens of millions of time steps such that at least half of the total simulated time does not change the characteristics of the visible structures . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified that , while the details of the shown structures do depend on initial conditions , the significant characteristics , such as the peaks in the resulting scattering intensities , are well defined .    </S>",
    "<S> we study isoelectric complexes where the total charges on dna and the cls neutralize each other , with no added counterions . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the complex is determined as a function of two parameters : ( i ) the fraction of cls , @xmath8 , which can be varied by adding different amounts of neutral lipids ( nls ) , and ( ii ) the bending modulus , @xmath9 , which is the prefactor of the bending energy term introduced in the later version of the noguchi - takasu model @xcite to control the stiffness of the simulated membranes ( see eq .  ( 7 ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : giant ] shows the diffraction patterns of stiff complexes ( @xmath10 ) with different values of @xmath8 ranging from @xmath11 ( a ) to @xmath12 ( l ) . following the approach outlined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we calculate diffraction patterns from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fourier transformation @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the 2d coordinate of the dna rod or the 2d coordinate of a bead s center of mass in the plane perpendicular to the dna axis , @xmath15 is the reciprocal vector , and @xmath16 represents the electron density of the @xmath17th particle relative to bulk water . for each value of @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we show a triplet of figures consisting of ( left ) the simulated scattered intensity from the dna rods ( with @xmath18 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fourier ] ) ) , ( middle ) the simulated scattered intensity from the lipids ( @xmath19 ) , and ( right ) the self - assembled structure of the complex . </S>",
    "<S> the displayed scattering intensities are @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the average over all angels . </S>",
    "<S> all the dna scattering plots are drawn on the same scale . </S>",
    "<S> the lipid scattering plots are also drawn on the same scale , except for ( a)-(e ) which are multiplied by the factor indicated on the corresponding plot . </S>",
    "<S> the relative scattering intensity of the lipids and the dna depends on their electron densities , as well as on @xmath8 . using reasonable values for the electron densities @xcite , we find that the scale of the dna intensities is two order of magnitude larger than that of the lipids . nevertheless , the scattering plots of the lipids exhibit two well identified peaks located at @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks are commonly associated with the lamellar structure . from the position of the first lamellar peak </S>",
    "<S> , one can extract the inter - layer lamellar spacing @xmath25 through @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the dna plots generally exhibit three peaks , two of which coincide with the lamellar peaks from the lipid scattering plots , and one which is commonly referred to as the `` dna peak '' . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the latter at @xmath27 provides information about the dna spacing within each layer of the lamellar structure , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the scattering from the dnas includes the information about the lamellar spacing observed also in the scattering intensity from the lipids . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood by considering the idealized lamellar structure sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ideal ] . in this structure , </S>",
    "<S> the dna rods form an oblique lattice with lattice vectors equal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal lattice is also oblique with the same angle @xmath32 between the lattice vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks which can be seen in the scattering plots of the dnas correspond to the reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> these are also the peaks which are usually observed in actual scattering experiments @xcite . for idealized lamellar structures , the scattering intensity has peaks at other wavevectors @xmath38 which correspond to linear combinations of integer - multiples of @xmath35 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of these peaks are @xmath32-dependent @xcite . in non - idealized complexes , like the ones in our simulations , these peaks are usually very small and are hard to be detected in the scattering plots .    two open arrows are drawn in each of the lipid scattering plots included in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : giant ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first one indicates the position of the larger lamellar peak which is located at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the second one denotes the wavevector @xmath24 , where we indeed find the second lamellar peak . </S>",
    "<S> these two arrows are copied into the corresponding dna scattering plot , verifying that these peaks are also reproduced by the dna ordering as explained above . notice that @xmath23 is only weakly dependent on @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the position of the third peak , which is indicated by the solid arrow , varies noticeably with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this peak is located at @xmath29 , and the variations in its position reflect the decrease in the dna spacing with increasing @xmath8 . from the computed scattering plots shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : giant ] , we can extract @xmath25 and @xmath39 as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : companion ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the visual impression of this plot is that the results are in overall agreement with the idealized geometry of a lamellar structure shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ideal ] . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the lamellar spacing is well approximated by the sum of twice the length of the lipids and the diameter of the dna rods , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the characteristic distance @xmath28 between dna rods in each layer approximates a linear relationship with @xmath41 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship can be derived from the simple geometric consideration that equally spaced dna rods fill the surface area made available by the lipid bilayer material for any given charge density . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , noticeable deviations from this idealized picture , especially at large @xmath8 . the lamellar spacing decreases below the ideal value , while the dna spacing attains values higher than predicted by the linear relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these discrepancies becomes clear by inspection of the corresponding structures shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : giant ] , where we observe that the long range lamellar order is lost at high @xmath8 in favor of a disordered arrangement of smaller dna - bilayer fragments . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is consistent with previously described membrane rupture at high charge densities resulting from the electrostatic stresses that develop in the complex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the highly charged cationic membrane fragments strongly associate with the dna rods to form the disordered structures seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : giant ] ( a)-(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we should not , therefore , be surprised that the values of @xmath25 and @xmath39 , which we inferred for lamellar structures , deviate from the expected behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the nearly constant behavior of @xmath39 vs.  @xmath8 in the disordered phase can be well observed in the structures seen in fig.[fig : giant ] ( a)-(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in @xmath25 in this regime is also consistent with the transition into the disordered phase , where the highly charged cationic membranes become squeezed between the negatively charged dna rods .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : companion ] ( b ) shows the synchrotron x - ray scattering data reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the simulation results in ( a ) is obvious , lending credibility to our cg model as well as to the fourier space analysis of the resulting structures . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axes of the figures express the inverse of the membrane charge density using different scales : @xmath41 in ( a ) and @xmath42 ( the mass ratio between the lipid and dna material ) in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scales are linearly related by : @xmath43 . in both figures , the lamellar spacing approaches the asymptotic value @xmath44 at small membrane change densities . </S>",
    "<S> these asymptotic values are different in the two figures , but this is merely a consequence of the chosen model parameters for @xmath2 and @xmath45 , which slightly differ from the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> both figures exhibit a weak , and very similar , monotonic decrease of @xmath25 with increasing membrane charge density . for fully charge membranes , the value of @xmath25 is depressed by about 15 - 20% compared to the low density asymptote . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this decrease has been attributed to the difference in length between dopc ( neutral ) and dotap ( cationic ) , the latter being about 6 shorter than the former . </S>",
    "<S> we , however , observe the same behavior with cls and nls being geometrically identical . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations point to two more explanations for this observation : for moderately charged membranes the effective bilayer thickness slightly shrinks with @xmath8 due to the tensile stress induced by the ( negative ) electrostatic energy density of a confined charge neutral systems @xcite . for high membrane charge density , </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in @xmath25 is likely related to the loss of lamellar order . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the derived value of @xmath46 does not necessarily coincide with the actual interlayer spacing , since the derivation is based on the presumption that the complex is ideally lamellar .    </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the simulation and experimental results for @xmath39 is also clear . in both fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : companion ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we observe that the dna spacing drops from @xmath47 at low charge densities to @xmath48 at high charge densities , in a manner which is well approximated by a linear relationship with the inverse charge density . at very high charge densities , </S>",
    "<S> both figures exhibit the same deviation from a linear relationship between @xmath39 and the inverse charge density . </S>",
    "<S> this feature has been attributed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the limiting contact distance , @xmath49 , between dna rods . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the results is correct provided that the hydration shell is included in the contact distance . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide yet another possibility . </S>",
    "<S> visual inspection of the self - assembled structures show that the dna rods do not experience any hard core interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau - like behavior of @xmath39 at high charge densities is related to the formation of disordered structures which enable a more loose packing of the dna rods .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have described in this paper is based on the very close agreement between the computational and experimental results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : companion ] . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be explained by a structural shift from lamellar to fragmented geometry occurring at high membrane charge densities . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation of the membranes is consistent with the membrane rupture observed in our earlier work described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where we used a different cg membrane model . </S>",
    "<S> this consistency gives us confidence that the loss of structural integrity of the membrane at high charge densities is not an artifact of a particular model . </S>",
    "<S> however , we recognize that although this work features the largest complexes ever simulated , there may still be some finite size effects that obscure the comparison with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one such finite size effect is related to the periodic boundary conditions along the dna axis , which enforce the infinite dna rods to lie parallel to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint , which simplifies the computational scheme , may lead to the formation of structures with artificial spatial correlations between the dna rods . </S>",
    "<S> another finite size effect is related to the relatively small sizes of the simulated complexes which , therefore , have scattering plots with peaks that are broader than in the corresponding experimental scattering plots . </S>",
    "<S> this low resolution makes it difficult to infer the degree of order from the width of the peaks . </S>",
    "<S> yet another consequence of finite sizes is the enhancement of surface effects . while it seems plausible </S>",
    "<S> that the increase in the electrostatic tensile stress at high charge densities does proliferate structural defects , it can be that these defects form more easily on the boundaries of the complex and , therefore , they become over - expressed in our smaller complexes . nevertheless , the close agreement between fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : companion ] ( a ) and ( b ) , over the entire range of charge densities , supports the possibility that structural variations observed in our simulations may take place in nature . </S>",
    "<S> such a structural shift from lamellar to fragmented geometry should have implications for gene therapy . </S>",
    "<S> the shift may explain the improvement in transfection efficiency ( te ) exhibited by these complexes at high membrane charge densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main limiting stages in the transfection process is the release of the genetic material from the complex into the cytoplasm of the host cell . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed reasonable to expect that the dna rods will be more readily released from the fragmented disordered complexes than from lamellar structures with long range order . given the remarkable success of our model , which is based on a highly cg representation of the constituting molecular species and their interactions , it is fair to anticipate the application of this model for obtaining direct observations of the mechanisms governing transfection and gene delivery . </S>"
