    "( k - s),@xcite the interacting electron gas is replaced by non - interacting electrons moving in an effective potential . in this construction ,",
    "the non - interacting density @xmath1 is equal to the interacting one @xmath2 but no other property of the interacting ground state is in principle retained in the non - interacting wave function .",
    "initially dft was formulated to describe the total ground state energy of an interacting system and @xmath2.@xcite although progress towards more accurate density functionals is ongoing , current approximations such as the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and more recent gradient - based extensions@xcite are already successful in predicting many electronic properties of real materials .",
    "this success has led to the use of dft beyond its formal scope and unfortunately tempted some to believe that if we had the exact ground state density functional , we would only need to solve non - interacting problems even for properties not related to the ground state energy and density . while the virtues and limitations of the kohn - sham _ eigenvalues _ are discussed in textbooks,@xcite the possible reasons for the success or failure of kohn - sham _ wave - functions",
    "_ in many - body problems are little understood and widely dispersed throughout the literature .",
    "it is often assumed , without a formal proof , that the kohn - sham non - interacting ground state wave - function forms a good description of the interacting ground state wave - function to be used as the foundation of theories that go beyond dft such as gw - bethe salpeter equation ( gw - bse ) , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , or even configuration interaction ( ci ) .",
    "this leads to an apparent contradiction in the literature since density functionals that provide wave - functions that are a good starting points in one field ( as judged by comparison with experiment ) are found inadequate in others . broadly summarizing : for structural properties gradient corrected density functionals@xcite are nowadays preferred over lda.@xcite structural properties depend essentially of atomic forces which in turn are related to the density .",
    "however , for gw - bse calculations of optical properties , an lda - based ground state is preferred@xcite . in this approach a good initial approximation for the green function",
    "is required . in qmc calculations",
    "a ( non - interacting ) hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state might be preferred over lda , but the subject is still under debate . in ci calculations , instead , it is empirically claimed that the convergence with natural orbitals@xcite is more rapid than hf orbitals .    in diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc )",
    "a trial wave function enforces the antisymmetry of the electronic many - body wave function@xcite and the nodal structure of the solution .",
    "the accuracy of the trial wave - function is critical and determines the success or failure of the method to accurately predict properties of real materials .",
    "the trial wave - function is usually a product of a slater determinant @xmath3 and a jastrow factor @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath3 is often constructed with single particle kohn - sham orbitals or from other mean field approaches such as hf .",
    "the jastrow , in turn , is a symmetric factor which does not change the nodes , but accelerates convergence and improves the algorithm s numerical stability .",
    "the dmc algorithm finds the lowest energy of the set of all wave - functions that share the nodes of @xmath5 .",
    "the exact ground state energy is obtained only if the exact nodes are provided .",
    "since any change to an antisymmetric wave - function must result in a higher energy than the antisymmetric ground state , the energy obtained with arbitrary nodes is an upper bound to the exact ground state energy.@xcite only in small systems is it possible to improve the nodes @xcite or even avoid the trial wave - function approach altogether@xcite .",
    "consequently , a general formalism that could alleviate the nodal error in large systems@xcite is highly desired .",
    "quite recently it has been shown that within the single slater determinant approach the computational cost of the dmc algorithm can have an almost linear scaling with the number of electrons@xcite .",
    "it is claimed , if not formally proved , that the nodes of the many - body wave - function are not too far from those of a wave function obtained via a mean field approach .",
    "however , this might not continue to hold as electron - electron interactions become more important . to improve the accuracy of these approaches and",
    "increase the range of materials to which they can be applied it is important to examine the advantages of different mean - field wave - functions .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that density - density functionals can be obtained by finding the minimum of different cost functions relating the set of non - interacting @xmath6-representable ground state with an interacting many - body state .",
    "the minimum of these cost functions establishes a correspondence between the non - interacting and the interacting wave - functions and their associated densities and potentials .",
    "the cost function can be designed to retain selected properties of the many - body wave function in the non - interacting one .",
    "crucially , for dmc applications the nodes can be optimized . under certain conditions",
    "density - density functionals exist that can lead to standard scalar - density functionals . as in the case of standard dft",
    ", this proof does not mean that we know the expression of each functional or associated potential but it will certainly stimulate the search of methods to find or approximate them . for dmc applications it is enough to prove that an optimal mean field potential for nodes exists . in order to test the theory",
    ", we find the ground state wave function of a model interacting system",
    ". then we obtain ( i ) the exact dft effective exchange correlation potential associated with the ground state density , ( ii ) the potential that maximizes the projection of @xmath3 with the ground state .",

    "accordingly , while all the cost functions we propose here would be minimized if we could reach the interacting many body state @xmath32 ( where , of course , every property is retained exactly ) , because our search is constrained to non - interacting @xmath6-representable subset the minimum we would find will depend on the properties we wish to retain .",

    "since we only need one optimal wave - function , any from a degenerate minimum can be chosen to construct the density - density functional @xmath40 . when minimization of a cost function defines a one to one correspondence with an inverse , a more usual energy - density functional of the form @xmath41\\}$ ] can be constructed .",
    "only a restricted class of cost functions lead to density transformations with an inverse .",
    "minimization of the cost functions among all pure - state - non - interacting @xmath6-representable densities defines the optimal effective potential which is a function of this density .",
    "given a cost function , @xmath35 , finding an approximation for the density transformation operator @xmath40 could certainly be as demanding as finding an approximation for the energy - density functional @xmath42 $ ] required by dft based methods .",
    "this task is beyond the goal of this paper .",
    "however , we will show that we can expect the operator associated to the best nodes for dmc ( @xmath43 ) to be non - local and very different from the identity .",
    "accordingly we can expect non - interacting wave - functions with good nodes to be a poor source of densities .",
    "moreover , for the example considered below , we find , that the direction we might have to explore to optimize the potential might be surprisingly different than the attempts considered so far@xcite .      we next show that optimization of the nodes for dmc among the set of @xmath36representable wave - functions leads to a correspondence between _ pure state _ @xmath6-representable densities and pure state non - interacting @xmath6-representable densities of the class described above .",

    "this change in the potential remains present when the potential is written in the complete cosine basis .",
    "thus , the effective potential must change in accord with the property of the interacting ground state that one aims to enforce in the non - interacting ground state with a cost function .",
    "figure [ fg : potentials ] shows the effective potentials used for the calculations shown in fig [ fg : densities ] .",

    "( [ eq : ks0 ] ) could be zero only for a pure - state - non - interacting @xmath6-representable nodal surface .",
    "however , if the nodes are not , replacing in @xmath97 could result in a potential that simply prevents the non - interacting wave - function to reach regions of space where the nodes are more troublesome",

    "[ fg : potentials](d ) presents a maximum in regions where instead figs .",
    "[ fg : potentials](b ) and [ fg : potentials](c ) develop a minimum .",
    "these are the regions where the electrons in the many - body wave - functions tend to localize because of correlation effects .",

    "the optimal effective potentials are strongly dependent on the property we target to retain in the wave - function . ]      in order to quantitatively test the quality of the nodes of the wave - functions found by minimization of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kr ] ) , ( [ eq : kdet ] ) and ( [ eq : ks0 ] ) and to test the convergence of the nodes of the full ci calculations , we take advantage of the homogeneous distribution of points @xmath112 at the nodal surface @xmath51 described earlier .    for each point @xmath11 in @xmath112 we can find the distance @xmath113 to the node of another wave - function @xmath114 in the direction of @xmath115 .",

    "the quantity @xmath122 is a measure on how much the error in the nodes would affect the probability density and thus it can be understood as the as a measure of the nodal error in the ground state energy . again in this case the non - interacting ground state without any effective potential is the best approximation .    ]",
    "although the numerical investigation of the different density - density functionals described above required numerical representation of the many body ground state wave - function , the conclusions that we draw have general value .",
    "the model we explore is simplified but has the advantages that the results can be converged and are free of significant approximations .",
    "the simplified interaction used in the model retains essential features of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we have shown ( fig .",
    "[ fg : densities ] and [ fg : potentials ] ) that the effective densities and potentials are explicit functions of a cost function .",
    "potentials and densities very different to the exact dft solutions are obtained if we enforce properties beyond @xmath124 in the cost function .",
    "the exact dft wave - function matches @xmath7 with _ complete _ disregard to other elements of the many body wave - function structure .",
    "since the hohenberg - kohn theorem@xcite is valid , optimizing other properties of the non - interacting ground state in general requires changing the potential with a resulting impact on the density .",
    "we find that mean field methods , while giving an accurate description of the density can mislead us in other aspects of the wave - function structure such as the nodal surface . in this paper",
    "we argue that , among the pure - state - non - interacting @xmath6-representable densities , there is at least one that more accurately describes the interacting ground state nodes .",
    "we can optimize the wave - function associated with this density with a cost function .",
    "the cost function form depends on the property we target to retain and also the optimal density we find . for the nodes ,",
    "the optimal cost function is clearly the dmc energy .",
    "a fixed cost function establishes a density - density correspondence which can be described as an operator @xmath125 that transforms interacting densities into non - interacting ones .",
    "while finding the functional form of @xmath43 is a task beyond the scope of this paper , we argue that we can expect this operator to be highly non - local and very different from the identity , in particular for strong electron - electron correlations .",
    "we find that we can improve the nodes with some simple cost functions , but the best nodes we found were obtained solving the non - interacting problem without the addition of any effective potential .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that this result might well be an accident of the model .",
    "our result , however , shows that the popular expectation that the dft solution is a good starting point for nodes is not valid in general .",
    "optimal wave - functions can be found by altering an external potential .",
    "this idea is not new . in practice wave - functions",
    "are optimized with the trial wave - function only minimizing the ground state energy @xmath126 , or the variance of the ground state energy . replacing @xmath127 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vk ] ) leads to a procedure similar to the optimization of filippi and fahy @xcite providing additional support to that method . in the case of refs . @xmath128",
    "the nodes are selected by adjusting the mix of density functionals that gives the lowest dmc energy for a small system .",
    "the same mix is then used in a larger system .",
    "this procedure is in fact equivalent to optimizing the shape of the effective potential with the restriction of remaining a linear combination of two of more exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "we find that the change in the effective potential required to optimize the nodes could be of the order of the _ hartree _ potential , since the wave - function with the best nodes is the non - interacting ground state , without any effective potential , for all the range of interaction strengths and shapes explored .",
    "our results suggest that counter intuitive directions for potential optimizations should be explored to improve the nodes .",
    "potential optimization has also been applied for the prediction of electronic excitations .",
    "since @xmath7 determines @xmath129 ( but from a constant ) , the excitation spectra @xmath130 is a function of @xmath7 .",
    "this allows defining cost functions @xmath131 to match the spectra of a non - interacting system . in order to minimize @xmath131",
    "one should do the derivatives @xmath132 as in ref @xcite . when @xmath133 is taken from experiment , the search of a potential giving a non - interacting density that minimizes @xmath131 is equivalent to the empirical potential method.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the electronic density can no longer be used to obtain the forces on the atoms .",
    "the existence of a single density functional that can be used to obtain the excitation spectra of any system is then a subject of debate .    in summary ,",
    "although the popular languages of electronic structure theory all share the same quantum mechanical underpinnings , when applied by experts to physical systems we often reach different conclusions .",
    "many experts in qmc prefer hf wave - functions , while in contrast calculations done within the gw - bse approach often rely on lda derived wave - functions and energies@xcite , while some hybrid density functionals obtain single particle excitations in direct agreement with excitation spectra@xcite .",
    "we argue that as different theories need to retain _ different _ properties of the _ same ground state _ wave - function to minimize errors , different functionals should also be used . in some cases these functionals",
    "correspond to the minimization of cost functions designed to retain properties of the many body ground state in the non - interacting wave - function .",
    "since some properties are favored at the expense of others , it is unlikely that we can use the same functional universally : we find that a function designed for optimal nodes is a bad source of densities and vise versa . here",
    "we give a qualitative picture of the size of the differences that one can expect as correlations start to dominate . with increasing interaction strength , the exact kohn - sham non - interacting wave - function becomes a much poorer description of several properties of the many - body ground state .",
