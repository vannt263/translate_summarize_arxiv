    "recently developed numerical codes offer the possibility of extremely accurate and computationally efficient evolutions of einstein s evolution equations in vacuum @xcite . to take full advantage of these new techniques to perform an unconstrained evolution of initial data and boundary conditions",
    ", we must address an unpleasant fact : many choices for evolution equations and and boundary conditions permit ill - behaved , unphysical solutions ( e.g. growing , constraint - violating solutions ) near physical solutions .    by way of example , when kidder , scheel , and teukolsky ( kst ) evolved a single static schwarzchild hole as a test case , they found evidence suggesting that their evolution equations and boundary conditions , when linearized about a schwarzchild background , admitted growing , constraint - violating _ eigenmodes _",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "these eigenmodes were excited by generic initial data ( i.e. roundoff error ) ; grew to significant magnitude ; and were directly correlated with the time their code crashed .",
    "as this example demonstrates , the existence and growth of ill - behaved solutions limit the length of time a given numerical simulation can be trusted  or even run .",
    "for this reason , some researchers have explored the analytic properties of various formulations of einstein s equations @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and boundary conditions @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite used in numerical relativity , searching for ways to understand and control these undesirable perturbations .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss one particular type of undesirable perturbation : short - wavelength , transient wave packets .",
    "[ for the purposes of this paper , a transient will be any solution defined in the future domain of dependence of the initial data slice .",
    "depending on the boundary conditions , the solution may or may not extend farther in time , outside the future domain of dependence .",
    "inside the future domain of dependence , however , `` transient solutions '' are manifestly independent of boundary conditions . ]",
    "depending on the evolution equations and background spacetime used , these transients can potentially grow significantly ( i.e. by a factor of more than @xmath0 in amplitude ) . under these conditions ,",
    "even roundoff - level errors in initial data should produce transients that amplify to unit magnitude .",
    "once errors reach unit magnitude , then guided by the kst results discussed above , we expect nonlinear terms in the equations to generically cause these errors to grow even more rapidly , followed shortly thereafter by complete failure of a numerical simulation .",
    "in other words , if the formulation and background spacetime permit transients to amplify by @xmath0 , we expect numerical simulations of these spacetimes to quickly fail .    in this paper",
    "we develop conditions which tell us when such dramatic amplification is _",
    "assured_. specifically , we describe how to compute the amplification of certain transients for a broad class of partial differential equations ( first - order symmetric hyperbolic pdes ) that includes many formulations of einstein s equations .",
    "if this amplification is larger than @xmath0 , then we know we should not evolve this formulation numerically .      in this paper , we analyze the growth of transients .",
    "[ remember , in this paper a transient is any solution defined in the future domain of dependence of the initial data slice . ] rather than study all possible formulations , we limit attention to a class of partial differential equations we can analyze in a coherent , systematic fashion : first - order symmetric hyperbolic systems . furthermore , because we concern ourselves only with stability and the growth of small errors , we limit attention to linear perturbations upon some background . finally , to be able to produce concrete predictions , we restrict attention to those transients which satisfy the geometric optics approximation .    in sec . [",
    "sec : rays ] we introduce an explicit ray - optics - limit solution to first - order symmetric hyperbolic linear systems  a class which includes , among its other elements , linearizations of certain formulations of einstein s equations .",
    "we provide explicit odes which determine the path ( i.e. ray ) and amplitude of a geometric - optics solution , in terms of initial data at the starting point of the ray .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : packets ] , we introduce wave packets as solutions which are confined to a small neighborhood of a particular ray .",
    "we further define two special classes of wave packet  coherent wave packets and prototyptical coherent wave packetes  which , because of their simple , special structure , are much easier to analyze . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy ] , we introduce and discuss the technique ( energy norms ) we will use to characterize the amplitude of wave packets . in particular , we provide an explicit expression [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate : prototypical ] ) ] for the growth rate of energy of a prototypical coherent wave packet .    to demonstrate",
    "explicitly how the techniques of the previous sections can be applied to produce the growth rate of transients , in sections [ sec : ksttests : rindler ] and [ sec : ksttests : pg ] ( as well as appendix [ ap : kst ] ) we describe by way of example how our methods can broadly be applied to the two - parameter formulations that kidder , scheel , and teukolsky ( kst ) have proposed @xcite .",
    "specifically , sections [ sec : ksttests : rindler ] and [ sec : ksttests : pg ] will respectively describe wave packets on flat - space ( written in rindler coordinates ) and radially propagating transients on a schwarzchild - black - hole background ( expressed in painleve - gullstrand coordinates ) .    finally , to demonstrate explicitly how expressions for the growth rate of transients can be used to filter out particularly pathological formulations , in sections [ sec : kstnumerics : rindler ] and [ sec : kstnumerics : pg ] we use the results for the growth rates of transients obtained in sections [ sec : ksttests : rindler ] and [ sec : ksttests : pg ] to determine what pairs of kst parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) _ guarantee _ significant amplification of some transient propagating on a rindler and painleve - gullstrand background , respectively .      while the fundamental ideas behind this paper  the study of wave packets and the use of their growth rates to discover ill - behaved formulations",
    " remains simple , when we attempted to perform practical , accurate computations , we quickly found the simplicity of this idea masked behind large amounts of novel ( but necessary ) notation .",
    "we therefore found it difficult to simultaneously satisfy the casual reader  who wants only a summary of the essential results , and who is still evaluating whether the results and the methods used to obtain them are worthy of further attention  and the critical reader  who needs comprehensive understanding of our methods in order to evaluate , duplicate , and ( potentially ) extend them .",
    "we have chosen to slant the paper towards the towards the critical reader ; thus this paper is a _ comprehensive _ and _ pedagogical _ introduction to our techniques .",
    "while this paper can be consumed in a single reading , for the reader interested in a brief summary of the essential ideas and results , or for anyone making a first reading of this paper , the author recommends only reading the most essential details . first and foremost , the reader should understand the scope and significance of this paper ( i.e. read the abstract and sec .",
    "next , the reader should follow the general description of the techiques in sections [ sec : rays ] , [ sec : packets ] , and [ sec : energy ] in detail .",

    "the introduction to section [ sec : ksttests : rindler ] and the summary that section s results in section [ sec : sub : rindlernumbers : validity ] ) .",
    "finally , to understand how these techniques can be used to discrover ill - behaved formulations , the reader should examine sections [ sec : kstnumerics : rindler ] and [ sec : kstnumerics : pg ] .",
    "the more critical reader may wish to test and verify our computations .",
    "this reader should then review sections [ sec : rays ] , [ sec : packets ] , and [ sec : energy ] again , then work through sections [ sec : ksttests : rindler ] and [ sec : ksttests : pg ] in detail ( returning to the earlier sections for reference as necessary ) . this reader will also benefit from the general approach to kst 2-parameter formulations discussed in appendix [ ap : kst ] .    finally , the most skeptical readers will want to examine the conceptual underpinnings of and justifications for our every computation .",
    "this reader should simply follow the text as presented , but carefully read every footnote and appendix as they are mentioned in the text . in particular , this reader will want to review our appendicies [ ap : validityofrayoptics ] ( for a justification of our ray - optics techniques ) and [ ap : identities ] ( for many useful identities used in the previous appendix and elsewhere in the paper ) as well as appendix [ ap : prototypesasgeneric ] ( for a more detailed discussion of prototypical coherent wave packets , a key element in our computational method ) .",
    "first and foremost , we should emphasize that our work differs substantially from all previoius work on this subject : we very explicitly restrict attention to amplification over only a short time ( i.e. a light - crossing time ) .",
    "on the one hand , unlike other work , because of this restriction , our claims  being independent of boundary conditions  apply to _ all _ boundary conditions . on the other , because we forbid ourselves from studying our solutions outside the future domain of dependence of the initial data slice  even though , in practice , we could draw some elementary conclusions  in this paper we choose not to make any claims about how a formulation of einstein s equations will behave at late times ( i.e. its late - time stability properties ) .      in other papers which attempt to address the stability properties of various formulations of einstein s equations  for example , lindblom and scheel ( ls ) @xcite ",
    "the authors try to ( somewhat naturally ) an understanding of the _ dominant _ instability mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , we do not fully understand all the dominant instability mechanisms which can occur in generic combinations of evolution equations , boundary conditions , and background spacetimes .",
    "indeed , while some theoretical progress has been made towards estimating the dominant instability mechanisms ( i.e. ls ) , for generic `` reasonable '' formulations ( i.e. those which we have not excluded based on other known pathologies , such as being weakly hyperbolic ) , we currently can only reliably determine how effective simulations will be by running those simulations . and",
    "simulations are slow .    in this paper , instead of studying",
    "the _ dominant _ instability , we study _ an _ instability ( transients ) which we can easily understand and rigorously describe .",
    "we use this instability to discover formulations which are known to be troublesome ( i.e. which have trouble with transients ) .",
    "this paper makes extensive use of geometric optics , a special class of short - wavelength approximation .",
    "several authors have applied short wavelength techniques to study the stability of various formulations of einstein s equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these techniques , however , have generally been applied to systems whose coefficients do not vary in space , limiting their validity either to very small neighborhoods of generic spacetimes , or to flat space .",
    "previous analyzes have thus obtained only a description of local plane wave propagation : in other words , local dispersion relations . in this paper , with the geometric optics approximation , we describe how to glue these local solutions together . such gluing is essential if we are to obtain a good approximation to a global solution of the pde and hence a concrete , reliable estimate of the amplification of a transient . in this sense ,",
    "the present paper is the logical extension of work by shinkai and yoneda ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , an attempt at converting their analysis to precise , specific conditions one can impose which insure that transients do not amplify .",
    "this paper also employs the energy - norm techniques introduced by lindblom and scheel ( ls ) @xcite .",
    "energy norms provide a completely generic approach to determining the growth rate given a known solution and , moreover , can be used to _ bound _ the growth of generic solutions . while ls choose to apply these techniques to study a different class of solution  large - scale solutions whose growth presently limits their numerical simulations ",
    "these techniques remain generally applicable .",
    "we use them to characterize the growth of wave packets .",
    "in classical electromagnetism , certain short - wavelength solutions to maxwell s equations can be approximated by a set of ordinary differential equations for independently - propagating rays : a set of equations for the path a ray follows , and a set of equations which determine how the solution evolves along a given ray @xcite .",
    "this limit is known as the ray optics ( or geometric - optics ) limit . in this section ,",
    "we construct an analogous limit for arbitrary first - order symmetric hyperbolic linear systems .",
