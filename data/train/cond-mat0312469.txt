    "the screening of charged macromolecules in an electrolyte solution is a long standing problem which has prompted many attempts aiming at a theoretical explanation . in their pioneering work gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite",
    "used what is now referred to as poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory as the basis for a mean field treatment of the electrical double layer .",
    "this approach found its culmination about thirty years later in the famous dlvo theory of charged colloids @xcite .",
    "the major flaw of these mean field approaches is their neglect of correlations between the ions .",
    "the first attempt to work out such correlations for _ homogeneous _ electrolytes are due to debye and hckel @xcite , whose work remarkably ( and at first glance confusingly ) is also based on ( linearized ) poisson - boltzmann theory . in the _",
    "inhomogeneous _ case integral equation theories @xcite and recently field theories @xcite have become very popular in calculating correlation corrections to mean field double layers .",
    "however , in order to make progress and calculate physical quantities , approximations have to be made which , unfortunately , instead of clarifying the physics sometimes tend to obscure it .",
    "moreover , since in some of these methods , the free energy is not defined in a unique way , it becomes impossible to determine the specific role played by each source of correlations in the system .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to have a theoretical framework which retains the simplicity of the early attempts , but also accommodates correlation effects .",
    "this is the case for density functional theories .",
    "it is possible to rigorously rewrite the partition function of , say , a system of charged colloids , as a density functional @xcite , in which the contribution beyond mean field is seen to be expressible as an additive correlation correction to the free energy density , whose functional form is of course unknown and for which one has to make a reasonable ansatz .",
    "the spirit is very similar to the fundamental problem of integral equations , where one also has to make an educated guess ( namely , the closure relation ) , but in the functional case the ansatz involves a free energy density rather than a relation between two- and three - point functions .",
    "it thus relies on a different kind of intuition and thus permits complementary insight .",
    "one suggestion for such a functional correction has been made by nordholm @xcite .",
    "it relies on a debye - hckel treatment of the one component plasma ( ocp ) @xcite , in which the short - distance failure of linearization is cleverly overcome by postulating a correlation hole . since beyond a certain density",
    "the resulting ocp free energy density is a concave function of density , this favors the development of inhomogeneities . in the pure ocp",
    "these are balanced by the homogeneously charged background .",
    "however , if one uses the ocp free energy density as a correlation correction to the mean field functional describing the double layer at a charged surface , one has all the charge opposite to the counterions located on that surface , rather than homogeneously distributed as a stabilizing background .",
    "the consequence is that the double layer becomes unstable and all ions collapse onto the surface , an effect which has been termed `` structuring catastrophe '' @xcite .    to circumvent this instability without losing the physical transparency of a local functional",
    ", we recently proposed the debye - hckel - hole - cavity ( dhhc ) theory @xcite , in which we suggested a convex correlation functional .",
    "this was achieved by excluding the homogeneous background from a region of radius @xmath0 around the central ion during the debye charging process . for counterions with size we identified @xmath0 tentatively as the ion diameter .",
    "we then applied our theory to the screening of a charged rod by its counterions .",
    "comparisons of the ionic charge distribution obtained showed a very good agreement with the simulations for both monovalent and trivalent counterions .",
    "in this paper we test our theory for a different geometry : charged spherical colloids with point - like counterions . in general ,",
    "colloidal systems exhibit a rich phase behavior .",
    "the particles can agglomerate at high densities , generally an irreversible process , but they may also show a reversible liquid - vapor phase separation similar to the one present in simple molecular liquids . in order to prevent them from simply falling out of solution , one needs some kind of repulsion between the particles . introducing charged groups at the surface of the colloid is one way to do that . the large gain in entropy following the dissociation of a vast number of counterions into solution",
    "stabilizes the system , because an aggregation of colloids into a small sub - volume would  for reasons of global charge neutrality  also require the counterions to occupy this small volume and thereby give up much entropy .",
    "of course , the final state of the system is always a balance between energy and entropy , and if electrostatic interactions are strong , they will ultimately overcome entropy and lead to aggregation of the colloids @xcite .",
    "the resulting phenomenon of `` like charge attraction '' has received much attention , but it is of course only mysterious if one forgets that the entire system is neutral .",
    "admittedly , confusion persists about whether such a phase separation could also happen within mean field theory .",
    "even though rigorous proofs exist that pb theory will not permit attraction between like charged macroions under reasonably general circumstances @xcite , and that in a cell model treatment the compressibility will be positive @xcite , it has been claimed that an expansion of the free energy of a charged colloidal suspension into zero- , one- , two- etc .",
    "body terms will contain configuration independent volume terms , which may drive a phase separation even though the pair terms are purely repulsive @xcite .",
    "since unfortunately all these derivations rely on a linearization of pb theory , which might render the findings as artifacts @xcite , the issue appears to be open yet .",
    "all these phenomena ultimately depend on the screening produced by the ionic cloud , which in turn depends on the geometry of the system . in this regard ,",
    "a charged spherical colloid differs from a charged rod in two fundamental ways : the electrostatic potential and the spatial extension . the logarithmic potential present in the case of charged cylinders leads to the phenomenon known as manning condensation @xcite .",
    "if the line charge density exceeds a critical threshold , a certain fraction will remain loosely associated with the rod , even at infinite dilution , and renormalize the rod charge .",
    "a quantitative pb treatment of this provides a unique criterion for defining the effective charge of the system , even at finite densities @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for charged spherical colloids , which lose all their counterions in the limit of infinite dilution ; thus , the colloidal charge does not get renormalized . still , on often talks about effective charges , which mimic the stronger condensation of nonlinear theory within a linearized treatment @xcite . that , however , is clearly not a physical but rather a formal renormalization , necessitated by the simplified linear treatment , and is thus a different story .",
    "another important difference between the spherical and the cylindrical symmetry lies in the spatial extend . if a charged rod is infinitely long ( as is usually assumed in theoretical treatments ) , the number of counterions at any given distance from the rod is always infinite .",
    "in contrast , for a charged spherical colloid the number of counterions at any distance is always finite , since of course there is no direction along which the colloid is infinite .",
    "hence , fluctuations of the radial charge density are more likely to be important in the spherical case .",
    "the systems we will consider here are strongly charged colloids with point - like ions of some specific valence and no added salt inside a spherical cell . since all the particles are limited to be within one cell , correlations between _ different macroions _ and between microions belonging to _ different cells _ are not present . in our treatment",
    "we will thus exclusively focus on questions regarding the description of a _ single double layer_. furthermore , for point - like ions the interpretation of our cutoff parameter , @xmath0 , can obviously no longer be the particle diameter .",
    "we will introduce an alternative prescription for @xmath0 , based again on local density considerations and keeping in mind that its entire purpose is to prevent the functional from becoming unstable .",
    "we also derive an approximated version of our correlation functional , namely , its zero temperature limit .",
    "it has the huge advantage that it can be calculated analytically , while still predicting ion profiles quite close to the full dhhc expression for a wide range of parameters .",
    "it also demonstrates the spirit of our stabilization correction very directly .",
    "finally , we compare our predictions for ion profiles with monte carlo simulations , in which we independently vary valence @xmath1 and plasma parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the density of surface charges and @xmath4 is the bjerrum length . it has been shown that beyond @xmath5 the force - distance curves between charged plates cease to be monotonic , and beyond @xmath6 attractions set in @xcite",
    ". these effects result from correlations between different double layers ( like , for instance , ion interlocking @xcite ) , which we can not account for , and it has in fact been shown that they can not be described within a local density functional theory with a convex correlation correction @xcite . however , for the description of a _ single _ double layer the regime of applicability of our theory is larger , even though it clearly must fail for too high coupling .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the dhhc correlation functional is revisited and its zero temperature limit is introduced .",
    "it is then applied as a local correlation correction to the problem of screening of charged colloids in sec .",
    "the case of point - like ions is discussed in detail and the new expression for @xmath0 is proposed .",
    "technical details of the simulations are described in sec.iv .",
    "the results of the simulations , full theory and zero temperature limit are compared in sec .",
    "v , and we end with our conclusions sec.vi .",
    "the one component plasma consists of @xmath7 identical point - particles of valence @xmath1 and ( positive ) unit charge @xmath8 inside a volume @xmath9 with a uniform neutralizing background of charge density @xmath10 and dielectric constant @xmath11 . as a first approximation",
    "the free energy of this system can be derived in the framework of the debye - hckel approach .",
    "then , the electrostatic potential @xmath12 created by some ion , fixed at the origin for instance , and all its surrounding ions satisfies the spherically symmetric poisson equation @xmath13 .",
    "the charge density has a contribution from the central ion , @xmath14 , a contribution from the surrounding ions which are distributed  within mean field theory !  according to the boltzmann factor @xmath15 , and finally from the charged background . inserting this into the poisson equation and linearizing the exponential yields the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an inverse screening length , @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 is the bjerrum length , and @xmath20 is the inverse thermal energy .    the solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lpb ] ) is the well known expression @xmath21 .",
    "however , the problem with debye - hckel theory is that the condition for linearization is obviously not satisfied for small @xmath22 , where the potential is large . indeed",
    ", since all ions have the same sign of charge , this implies that the particle density becomes _ negative _ and finally diverges at the origin .",
    "this defect was overcome by the debye - hckel - hole theory @xcite , which artificially postulates a correlation hole of radius @xmath23 around the central ion into which no other ions are allowed to penetrate . in this case",
    "the charge density is given by @xmath24        -\\displaystyle\\frac{\\varepsilon \\kappa^2}{4\\pi } \\psi(r ) & r > h      \\end{array }    \\right .",

    "the simple debye - hckel - hole analysis of the one - component plasma theory offers considerable insight into ionic systems and is in good agreement with monte - carlo simulations @xcite when fluctuations on the charge density are not relevant @xcite . in principle , one can attempt to include such fluctuations by applying the bulk density - functional theory in a local way .",

    "the expression @xmath31 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f_ocp ] ) accounts for the correlation between the mobile ions .",
    "the ion distribution can be derived by minimization of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f_ocp ] ) under the constraint of charge neutrality .",
    "unfortunately , this variational process does not lead to a well defined density profile if one uses @xmath27 as the correlation correction @xmath31 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath27 is a concave function beyond @xmath32 and asymptotically behaves as @xmath33 .",
    "since there is no stabilizing homogeneously charged background but rather a concentration of opposite charge on the macroion surface , this favors the development of a distribution in which all the ions sit on the surface of the macroion .    the instabilities present in the dhh approach can be properly overcome by recognizing that the failure of this model is due to the too strong requirement of local charge neutrality imposed by the local density approximation : a local fluctuation leading to an increase of particle density implies a corresponding increase in background density .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation is not suppressed by an increase in repulsive coulomb interactions but quite on the contrary favored by its decrease . to circumvent the instabilities occurring at high densities , we proposed recently a simple solution in which one excludes the neutralizing background from a cavity of radius @xmath0 placed around the central ion ( for details of the derivation of the model see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the charge density can be split in three different regions , namely @xmath34 where the hole size @xmath23 is chosen such as to yield the same screening ( i.e. , the same amount of charge within @xmath23 ) as the dhh theory , which results in @xmath35^{1/3 } \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath36 . using this prescription for @xmath23",
    ", the free energy is obtained by debye - charging the fluid : @xmath37 where @xmath38 since the dhhc free energy is a convex function of density , @xmath39 can thus be used to account for correlations within a local density approximation .      the fact that the integral in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f_dhhc ] ) has to be solved numerically obstructs a direct view on how thermodynamic stability is actually restored .",
    "luckily , the crucial point can already be seen by focusing on the limit of zero temperature . in this case",
    "( [ eq : h_dhhc ] ) gives the expression @xmath41 for the correlation hole of the dhhc theory .",

    "the region @xmath42 contains the right amount of background charge to exactly neutralize the central ion , and it is appropriate to refer to this limit as `` complete screening '' .",

    "after the debye charging process one obtains the following closed expression for the excess free energy density : @xmath46 note that the limits @xmath47 and @xmath48 do _ not _ commute : for high densities , @xmath49 scales asymptotically like @xmath50 , i.e. , linear with density .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath47 eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f_dhhc0 ] ) becomes @xmath51 and this concave scaling with density prevents it from being used within a local density approximation .",
    "the zero temperature limit thus demonstrates in a clear way the key role played by the cavity of size @xmath0 , which excludes the uniform background from the vicinity of the central ion .      before applying this strategy to various valences and ionic strengths , we need to specify the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if the counterions have a diameter @xmath52 , no other charge should be found at a distance @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of the debye - hckel theory , we tentatively interpreted @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite as the ion diameter .",
    "this choice has led to an excellent agreement with simulations when applied to rod - like polyelectrolytes @xcite with mono- , di- , and trivalent counterions ( and no added salt ) , but it is of course infeasible for point ions . in the following we suggest an alternative way to choose a value for @xmath0 which is independent of excluded volume arguments , and show that this choice yields a good description of our monte carlo results and trends .",
    "we already mentioned the crucial role played by @xmath0 in maintaining the free energy convex .",
    "we also have seen in our discussion of the zero - temperature case that this is achieved because @xmath0 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : h_dhhc0 ] ) balances the length @xmath54 , which is basically the mean distance between ions .",
    "one could thus try to selfconsistently choose @xmath0 proportional to the local ion distance , but this would be unsuccessful : the balance would not work , since each density increase would shrink @xmath0 proportionally , and the collapse could not be stopped .",
    "one thus needs a length which is local and _ somehow _ related to the ion density  but which does _ not _ change as the local ion density changes .",
    "this suggests to pick the average distance between ions _ as predicted by pb theory _ : @xmath55 .",
    "our density functional then quite naturally emerges as a next order correction to the mean field result .",
    "after these general considerations on the cutoff @xmath0 , let us continue with a practical remark .",
    "far away from the charged surface the ion density is always quite low , correlations are weakly developed , and the precise value of @xmath0 is immaterial .",
    "in fact , we only ever need a stabilizing cutoff close to the charged surface , where the ion density is largest .",
    "this suggests the following simplification : instead of using a cutoff function @xmath56 depending on the local pb density , we pick a constant @xmath0 from a worst - case scenario , namely , the value which it has at contact .",
    "this then finally yields the following prescription for @xmath0 : @xmath57 in fact , since the cutoff will become important in the regime of strong correlations , we could even replace the contact density @xmath58 by its limiting value @xmath59 , where @xmath3 is the density of surface charges @xcite .",
    "we then find @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath62 plasma coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ eq : a_lim ] ) nicely demonstrates that in this limit the cavity size , measured in the appropriate length scale @xmath63 ( see also the scaling discussion in the appendix ) , is simply another measure of the coupling strength .",
    "charged spherical colloids are common and well characterizable systems for studying many electrostatic phenomena in pure culture , and they can often serve as simplified models for more complicated systems like polyelectrolytes or proteins . solutions containing such charged structures are indeed complicated to describe due to the long - range nature of the coulombic interactions .",
    "however , as long as these long range forces are repulsive , the colloids will create large correlation holes ( `` cells '' ) around themselves which are void of other colloids . in a first approximation one can then decouple the macroion interactions and concentrate on what s going on within a single correlation hole  an approach which is termed `` cell model '' @xcite .",
    "the cell picture is known to give a good approximation for many realistic systems , and most of the physics of the system is determined by the screening of the macroion by the microions inside a cell . as a test case for our theory we shall therefore consider a charged spherical colloid of radius @xmath64 containing @xmath65 charged groups , which are neutralized by point - like ions of valence @xmath1 .",
    "this macroion is embedded in the center of a spherical cell of radius @xmath66 , corresponding thus to a volume fraction @xmath67 of colloids .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the colloidal system is determined by the distribution of mobile ions around the macroion .",
    "this distribution is obtained by minimization of the free energy functional , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : f_ocp ] ) . for the colloidal system ,",
    "the interaction of the small ions with the macroion and the mean - field interaction between the counterions are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total electrostatic potential at position @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the potential due to the charged macroion alone .",
    "the inter - particle correlations are taken into account by employing @xmath72 .",
    "the minimization itself is accomplished by numerically solving the corresponding euler - lagrange - equation .",
    "special care had to be taken to obtain a sufficient accuracy of the rapidly varying density profiles close to the colloid surface .",
    "in the following we will concentrate on two observables .",
    "the first is the integrated fraction of ions within a radial distance @xmath22 from the colloid center , which is given by @xmath73 we will sometimes plot @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 , which is the green function of the spherical laplacian .",
    "this will visually expand the region close to the colloid , but it also has practical advantages when estimating the amount of closely associated ions , see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "measuring all lengths in the full partition function of the cell model in units of @xmath18 reveals that the distribution function @xmath76 is invariant under a rescaling which keeps the number of counterions @xmath77 , the reduced colloid size @xmath78 , and the volume fraction @xmath67 constant ( see appendix ) .",
    "the same holds for pb theory , and it is also true for dhhc theory . in the latter case",
    "this not only relies on the form of the dhhc free energy correction ( [ eq : f_dhhc ] ) , but also on our particular choice of @xmath0 .",
    "this invariance property is thus a further support for eqn .",

    "this would lead to a different result , reminding us that selfconsistency and consistency with other rigorous results can not generally be achieved .",

    "[ fig : v_scan ] we show a `` complementary '' scan , in which we fixed the value of the plasma - parameter @xmath98 , but changed the counterion valence ( systems 3 , 5 , and 6 from tab .",
    "[ systems ] ) .",
    "maybe surprisingly , an _ increase _ in valence leads to a _ decrease _ in condensation if it happens at constant plasma - parameter and colloid charge . if we had changed @xmath1 from 1 to 2 and simultaneously replaced @xmath100 _ and _ @xmath101 , the plasma parameter would also have remained unchanged , but due to the scaling property of the partition function that would actually have been true for the whole distribution function .",
    "instead , we have reduced @xmath102 ( i.e. , a little less strongly ) , but have failed to increase @xmath65 .",
    "the net result is that condensation drops slightly .",
    "however , since the plasma parameter , which is the best indicator for the strength of correlations , remains the same , the _ deviation _ between pb theory and mc simulation are always about the same ( not shown in the figure ) . and as a consequence , the deviation between dhhc  theory , which approximately accounts for correlations , and the mc simulation , which captures them all , is about the same in all three cases , and actually not very big .",
    "another strategy to check how successful our approach captures correlations is to compute the osmotic pressure . in real systems",
    "this pressure will depend on correlations between ions of _ different _ cells , something which neither our theory nor actually our simulation ( of a single colloid ! ) takes into account .",
    "so in the following by `` pressure '' we do not , strictly speaking , refer to the bulk pressure of a colloidal suspension at some given volume fraction , but only to the pressure exerted on the rigid wall at @xmath103 of our cell model .    .",
    "]    within the simulations , the pressure is given by the contact density at @xmath103 , which was obtained by fitting the mc density profile close to the cell boundary to a quadratic expression @xmath104 .",
    "an example for how the simulated densities compare to the pb approximation , our analytic dhhc approach , and its simpler zero temperature limit dhhc@xmath40 , can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig.c1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ pressure ] shows the predictions for the pressure in the case of point - like ions given by pb- , dhhc- , and dhhc@xmath40-theory , as well as by mc simulations . in the case of pb - theory and",
    "mc the pressure is simply the density at the outer boundary , while for the dhhc approach we employ eqn .",
    "( [ eq : p_dhhc ] ) and for dhhc@xmath40eqn .",
    "( [ eq : cspressure ] ) .",
    "these data , as well as fig .",
    "[ fig.c1 ] , demonstrate that  as anticipated  the simulated pressures lie below the pb prediction .",
    "this decrease in pressure is rather accurately captured by our functional @xmath105 and by its zero temperature limit , @xmath106 , with the mc result lying significantly below pb and ( in these cases ) below dhhc  and above dhhc@xmath40 .",
    "the difference between the two correlation corrected approaches is consistent with the idea that entropic effects neglected in @xmath106 would push ions away from the macroions , or in other words , that the zero temperature limit implies stronger correlations than the regular dhhc  theory and therefore yields even lower pressures .",
    "in this paper we showed how to apply our previously proposed local density functional approach based on a stable correlation correction to a spherical macroion confined in a spherical cell .",
    "one of the crucial parameters in this theory is the size @xmath0 of the exclusion cavity of the background charge density . for point - like ions",
    ", we suggest to associate the exclusion region with the mean distance between ions as predicted by pb theory , and for simplicity use the value present at colloidal contact .    by going to the zero temperature limit we were able to derive an even simpler free energy functional @xmath107 , which is almost as good as the full dhhc  theory , but much easier to handle .",
    "we also derived exact expressions for the osmotic pressure in this system .",
    "we successfully compared our predictions to simulations of the same model and compared the integrated counterion density and the osmotic pressure values for two complementary `` scans '' of the coupling strength , namely valence and plasma parameter .",
    "we demonstrated that our local density functional approach based on a stable correlation correction leads to a major improvement over the pb prediction .",
