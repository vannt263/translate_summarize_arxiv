    "the demand for and interest in quantum control continue to increase with growing successes in manipulating the quantum dynamics of atomic , molecular , optical , and solid - state systems  @xcite . traditionally , the control is implemented by applying a classical electromagnetic field ( referred to as a _ classical controller _ ) , for example , a laser field applied to a molecular system or a magnetic field applied to a spin ensemble .",
    "recent studies show that control capabilities can be enhanced by coupling the system of interest ( referred to as the _ quantum plant _ ) to an auxiliary quantum system ( referred to as a _ quantum controller _ ) .",
    "the use of a suitable quantum controller makes it possible to achieve results beyond those reachable solely by classical fields in applications involving the manipulation of the system s entropy , for example , quantum heat engines  @xcite , cooling of quantum systems  @xcite , and quantum error correction with ancillary qubits  @xcite .",
    "such processes can be realized by either direct coupling  @xcite or indirect field - mediated interactions  @xcite between the system and a quantum controller , creating _ coherent quantum feedback _",
    "loops @xcite that can mediate the exchange of entropy . a related approach , known as _ autonomous feedback _ , employs engineered coupling of the controlled quantum system to a dissipative reservoir  @xcite .",
    "typical objectives optimized in quantum control applications are the transition probability between the initial and final state and , more generally , the expectation value of an observable ( a hermitian operator on the system s hilbert space )  @xcite .",
    "the value of such an objective achieved through a controlled evolution is commonly referred to as the _ control yield_. it is convenient to envision the optimal control design as an excursion over the control landscape defined by the functional dependence of the yield on the control variables . for a classical controller , the search for a globally optimal solution can be very efficient , due to fact that the landscape is free from local optima  @xcite upon satisfaction of reasonable physical assumptions  @xcite . the vast empirical evidence supporting this result is provided by a large body of successful optimal control experiments  @xcite and extensive numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "control landscapes for systems with a quantum controller were studied in  @xcite , showing that the trap - free property still holds upon satisfaction of similar assumptions over the composite system ( which consists of the plant and the controller ) .",
    "in addition to the topological landscape features such as the presence or absence of local optima , a practically important property is the values of the control objective at the landscape s global maximum and minimum .",
    "these values are the _",
    "kinematic bounds _ on the control yield , which are dynamically reachable provided that the system ( or the composite system in the case of a quantum controller ) is controllable @xcite .",
    "since most standard quantum optimal control problems can be formulated as the maximization of the control yield , we are mainly concerned with the upper kinematic bound , but any result obtained for the upper bound can be easily reformulated for the lower one as well .",
    "kinematic bounds have been studied for control of closed  @xcite and open  @xcite quantum systems . in the case of a closed quantum system coupled to a classical controller , the maximum and minimum yield values",
    "are referred to as the _ classical kinematic bounds _ ( ckbs ) .",
    "since any unitary dynamics can not change the system s entropy , the ckb is limited and can be surpassed by the addition of a quantum controller that absorbs entropy from the system .",
    "for example , it was shown  @xcite that the kinematic bounds on the fidelity of quantum operations can be improved when the quantum controller is initially in a low - entropy state .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the kinematic bounds on the control yield given by the expectation value of a quantum observable .",
    "relevant applications include , for example , the maximum work that can be exerted by a quantum heat engine  @xcite and the maximum degree of purification of the system s state  @xcite . with the use of a suitable quantum controller , the control yield can , in principle , reach the the ultimate physical limit , i.e. , the maximum ( or minimum ) eigenvalue of the target observable , which we refer to as the _ quantum kinematic bound _ ( qkb ) . under general circumstances , when the system is coupled to both a classical controller and a quantum controller , the kinematic bound lies between the ckb and qkb .",
    "we will present the necessary and sufficient condition for the quantum controller to surpass the ckb , as well as that to attain the qkb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinematic analysis ] , the problem of kinematic bounds on the control yield is formulated for a quantum system coupled to a quantum controller , and topological properties of the associated control landscape are investigated . in sec .",

    "section  [ sec : thermal ] illustrates the general results by considering a situation in which the system and controller are initially in thermal equilibrium states , including particular cases of two - level and four - level systems coupled to a thermal spin bath .",

    "generally , control is applied to the quantum plant by interacting it with external agent systems . depending on whether the agent system is classical or quantum",
    ", one can design a classical or quantum controller .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : controlframe](a ) , a classical controller unidirectionally supervises the plant , as usually the backaction from the plant can be ignored .",
    "the quantum controller is coherently coupled to the plant , which enables coherent feedback between them , and they can be manipulated by a classical controller , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : controlframe](b )",

    "we assume that @xmath13 is a separable state : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial density matrices of the system and controller , respectively .",
    "the initial state can , in principle , be a classically correlated state or an entangled state , but these possibilities will not be discussed here .    the evolution operator @xmath14 [ through its dependence on the hamiltonians @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath9 ] and , correspondingly , the control yield @xmath22 [ through its dependence on @xmath14 ] are functionals of the control variables . the functional dependence of @xmath22 on the control variables , through eq .  , defines the control landscape .",
    "if the composite system is evolution - operator controllable , i.e. , any @xmath24 is accessible through eq",
    ".   with some choice of the control variables , then the kinematic bounds @xmath16 and @xmath17 are dynamically reachable .",
    "controllability of the composite system is a reasonable assumption if the quantum controller is of manageable size . as proven in  @xcite ,",
    "if ( i ) the composite system is evolution - operator controllable , ( ii ) the jacobian of the map from the control variables to the evolution operator is full rank , and ( iii ) the control variables are not constrained , then the analysis of the landscape can be reduced to the so - called kinematic picture , in which the yield @xmath22 is considered as a function of the evolution operator @xmath14 over the unitary group @xmath25 .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite , the kinematic landscape picture ( valid under the above three assumptions ) has been used to prove that the critical points of the landscape ( [ eq : u - landscape ] ) can be grouped into a finite number of connected submanifolds of @xmath25 , each corresponding to a fixed yield value .",
    "these critical submanifolds include a unique global maximum submanifold and a unique global minimum submanifold , and the rest are saddle submanifolds ( i.e. , the landscape has no local optima ) .",
    "degeneracy structures of @xmath13 and @xmath26 determine the number @xmath27 of critical submanifolds ( or , equivalently , the number @xmath28 of saddle submanifolds ) and the codimension @xmath29 of the maximum submanifold in the control space .",
    "optimization searches tend to be more efficient on landscapes with smaller @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "for example , comparing the schematic landscapes in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a )  and  [ fig : schematics](b ) , we see that the former has no saddles , likely leading to faster searches over this landscape in the beginning , but the latter has the maximum submanifold of a higher dimension , which will likely accelerate the search near the top of this landscape as well as likely enable finding optimal solutions that are robust to control noise  @xcite .",
    "+    for given degeneracy structures of @xmath13 and @xmath26 , the landscape topology characteristics @xmath27 and @xmath29 can be calculated with the contingency table technique developed in  @xcite . for @xmath13 , we consider cases where initial states of the system and controller are pure , mixed , or maximally mixed , which are identified by the spectrum of the density matrix .",
    "the density matrix of a pure state has only one nonzero eigenvalue 1 , otherwise the state is called mixed .",
    "in particular , the state whose density matrix @xmath30 has all identical eigenvalues is called maximally mixed . for simplicity",
    ", we consider mixed states whose density matrices have non - degenerate spectra . for @xmath26 , let the observable @xmath10 have @xmath31 distinct eigenvalues @xmath32 with multiplicities ( degeneracy indices ) @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding analytical expressions obtained for @xmath27 and @xmath29 are listed in table  [ tab : summary ] ( see  ref .",
    "@xcite for derivation details ) .",
    "it is seen that when the quantum controller is prepared in a mixed state , there are more critical submanifolds on the landscape and the dimension of the maximum critical submanifold is smaller , which typically translates into a higher search effort . therefore , qualitatively",
    ", one should aim to prepare the controller in a pure state .",
    "the degeneracy of the target observable s spectrum also affects the @xmath27 and @xmath29 values , such that the search efforts tends to be higher when @xmath10 has more distinct eigenvalues or its maximum eigenvalue is less degenerate .",

    "the results in corollary  [ cr-2 ] have simple physical interpretations .",
    "when the system is in a pure state , the ckb and qkb coincide and thus no improvement beyond ckb is possible .",
    "when the state of the controller is maximally mixed , its entropy is maximal , and hence no flow of entropy from the system to the controller is possible , regardless of the system s state .",
    "more generally , theorem  [ th-1 ] indicates that , to improve the control yield , the controller s spectral bandwidth @xmath91 should be sufficiently large .",
    "this means that @xmath20 should be a low entropy state .",
    "note that in control of closed quantum systems with classical fields , the control pulse bandwidth is the key resource that determines the minimum time necessary to perform the optimal dynamics and saturate the ckb @xcite , but does not affect the value of the bound . in comparison , the spectral bandwidth of the quantum controller s state is a key resource that impacts how much the value of the kinematic bound on the control yield can be increased beyond the ckb .",
    "defined as the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the target observable , the qkbs represent the ultimate physical limit on the achievable yield .",

    "an important example of such a situation is the problem of achieving the maximum degree of purification of the system s state , in which case @xmath10 is a projector onto a pure state ( with only one nonzero eigenvalue 1 ) . for this special case , theorem  [ th-2 ] , with @xmath128 in eq .",
    ", states the condition for achieving complete purification ( in this sense , the purification problem is no different from the control yield maximization for any other observable with non - degenerate maximum eigenvalue ) .",
    "thus , theorem  [ th-2 ] is a generalization of a previously obtained condition on the reachability of maximum purification  @xcite .",

    "one can verify by symmetry that @xmath182 , so it is sufficient to investigate only the upper kinematic bound @xmath56 .",
    "let the system and controller be initially in thermal states of eq .   with temperatures @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "the spectra of @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend , respectively , on dimensionless parameters @xmath183 according to corollary  [ cr-5 ] , the ckb can be surpassed if and only if @xmath184    figure  [ fig : kb ] shows the dependence of the kinematic bounds @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the controller s parameter @xmath185 for a fixed @xmath186 and two values of @xmath170 ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath189 , the ckb holds : @xmath190 .",
    "when @xmath185 exceeds the threshold value @xmath191 , the bound @xmath56 surpasses the ckb and starts to grow .",
    "since thermal states have no zero eigenvalues ( for non - zero temperature ) , condition   of theorem [ th-2 ] can not be exactly satisfied for any finite value of @xmath185 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath192 , populations of the higher energy levels are nearly zero , and the kinematic bound asymptotically approaches the qkb : @xmath193 . comparing the curves for different numbers of the controller s spins ( @xmath187 versus @xmath188 ) , we see that both the threshold value for surpassing the ckb , @xmath194 , and a value of @xmath185 at which @xmath56 can be considered practically equal to the qkb ( e.g. , 99% yield ) are lower for larger @xmath170 .",
    "this implies that a larger controller is more effective in expanding the kinematic bounds .",

    "we investigated kinematic bounds on the control yield , defined as the expectation value of a system observable , for a general situation where the system of interest ( the quantum plant ) is coupled to both an external classical field ( a classical controller ) and an auxiliary quantum system ( a quantum controller ) .",
    "when a closed quantum system is coupled only to a classical controller , its dynamics is limited to unitary orbits , and the control yield is limited by the ckb that depends on the initial state .",
    "the main question explored in this work is to what degree the use of a quantum controller can aid in expanding the yield bounds .",
    "we answered this question by deriving two main results : the necessary and sufficient condition for the bound to surpass the ckb , as well as that for the bound to exactly reach the qkb which constitutes the ultimate physical limit .",
    "the condition for surpassing the ckb is expressed in terms of eigenvalues of the system s and controller s initial density matrices and also depends on the degeneracy structure of the target observable s spectrum . in order to satisfy this condition ,",
    "it is desirable to prepare the controller in a state with a large spectral bandwidth ( which translates into the energy spectral bandwidth for a thermal state ) . in comparison",
    ", the spectral bandwidth of a classical control field is a key factor determining the minimum time necessary to saturate the ckb , but it can not affect the value of the bound .    the condition for reaching the qkb does not depend on the magnitude of eigenvalues of the initial density matrices , but rather is expressed in terms of their ranks as well as the multiplicity of the maximum ( minimum ) eigenvalue of the target observable . for the system and controller consisting of qubits , this condition has an information - theoretic interpretation , i.e. , the number of controller qubits should be not less than the number of bits of information lost due to the mixedness of the system s and controller s states ( quantified by the sum of their quantum hartley entropies ) .",
    "if the controller is initially in a pure state , the qkb is reachable for any initial system state and any target observable , provided that the dimension of the controller is not less than that of the system .",
    "this condition on the controller s dimension is much milder than that for kraus - map controllability , i.e. , reachability of the ultimate physical limit for observable control does not require the capability to generate all kraus maps of the system .",
    "the general results as well as examples of thermal initial states indicate that a larger quantum controller is favorable for expanding the kinematic bounds on the control yield , as it can more effectively absorb entropy from the system .",
    "however , dynamic reachability of the kinematic bounds is guaranteed only if the composite system is evolution - operator controllable , which may have practical consequences . despite this practical limitation ,",
    "our findings are likely to provide a basis for a better understanding of control yields observed in experiments as well as help to establish the principles for designing effective quantum controllers .",
