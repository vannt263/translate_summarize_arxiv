    "absorbing phase transitions have been extensively studied during the last several decades . just like equilibrium systems ,",
    "these non - equilibrium systems are categorized by several universality classes according to symmetry and conservation .",
    "notable examples are the directed percolation ( dp ) class and the directed ising ( di ) class , to name only a few ( for an exhaustive review on universality classes , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .    although the deciding features of these universality classes are quite well , if not completely , understood ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , an exact solution of a typical model , even in one dimension , is still not available . the importance of exact solutions for understanding physical systems in theoretical physics can not be exaggerated , and an ample example is the onsager solution of the two - dimensional ising model  @xcite . by the same token , any exact solution of a model belonging to dp or di class is still desired .",
    "since exact solvability is intimately related to critical exponents being rational numbers , whether the critical exponents obtained from numerical studies can be represented by rational numbers has always been a question . for the dp class in one dimension , a certain set of rational numbers",
    "was proposed as the critical exponents , but later a detailed numerical analysis clearly disproved that conjecture  @xcite . on that account , it does not seem that an exact solution can be found for the dp class .",
    "for the di universality class , a set of rational numbers for critical exponents was also conjectured  @xcite . although numerical results in the literature look consistent with the conjectured values within error bars , whether this conjecture is true or not remains unanswered .",
    "the main aim of this paper is two fold .",
    "first , we would like to draw a firm conclusion as to whether the critical exponents for the di class in one dimension are rational numbers . to state the conclusion first , our extensive numerical study disproves the conjecture by jensen  @xcite .",
    "second , we suggest a numerical method to extract corrections to scaling that are important for accurate estimates of the critical exponents . as we will see later , information as to how corrections to scaling behave at the critical point is crucial when it comes to estimating the critical exponents accurately .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] introduces a model and defines the quantities in which we are interested . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cts ] , we propose a numerical method to find corrections to scaling from monte carlo simulation data . using this method in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] , we find the critical exponents by studying the corresponding effective exponents .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional branching annihilating random walk with two offspring ( baw2 ) , which is a prototypical model belonging to the di class in one dimension . among many versions of the baw2 , we chose the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we explain below the model and the algorithm we used for the simulations .",
    "the baw2 is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath15 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each lattice site can be either occupied by a particle ( @xmath16 ) or be vacant ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "double occupancy is not allowed .",
    "each particle can hop to one of its nearest neighbors or can branch two offspring .",
    "the detailed dynamic rules are as follows : @xmath18 where the parameters over the arrows represent the corresponding transition rates .    when @xmath19 , this model is exactly solvable  @xcite but it does not have a nontrivial phase transition in the sense that for any @xmath20 , the density decays to zero as @xmath21 with time @xmath22 . only when @xmath23 is smaller than 1 , there is a non - trivial critical point @xmath24 , and the model belongs to the di class . in this paper",
    ", we fix @xmath25 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and investigate the behavior of the baw2 as @xmath26 varies around the critical point @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , the system is said to be in the absorbing ( active ) phase .    in simulations , we used the following algorithm .",
    "assume that there are @xmath30 particles at time @xmath22 in the system . among the @xmath30 particles ,",
    "a particle is chosen at random .",
    "it may hop to one of its neighbors ( with probability @xmath31 ) or may branch two offspring to its two nearest neighbors ( with probability @xmath26 ) . if a branching attempt is tried with probability @xmath26 , its two neighbors ( to be called target sites )",
    "are examined .",
    "if both target sites are empty , these two sites become occupied with probability 1 .",
    "if one or both of the target sites are already occupied , the branching attempt becomes successful only with probability @xmath23 , but with probability @xmath32 this branching attempt is ignored , and nothing happens .",
    "assume that the branching attempt turns out to be successful .",
    "the empty target site becomes occupied , but the occupied target site becomes empty because of an immediate pair - annihilation event of new and occupied particles . in hopping attempts , one of two possible directions ( left or right ) is selected at random .",
    "if the selected site is vacant , it lands there with probability @xmath33 .",
    "if the selected site is occupied , the two particles undergo pair - annihilation with probability @xmath23 , but the hopping can be ignored with probability @xmath32 , and nothing happens .",
    "after an attempt described above , time increases by @xmath34 regardless of whether the attempt changes the configuration or not .",
    "we repeat the above procedure until either the system loses all particles or time exceeds the preassigned maximum observation time @xmath35 .    in simulations , we used two kinds of initial conditions . in one case ,",
    "simulations begin with the fully - occupied initial condition ( foic ) ; that is , @xmath36 . in the literature , simulations starting from the foic",
    "are generally referred to as static simulations .",
    "we will also use this terminology in this paper . in the other case ,",
    "all but a few sites in the middle are empty .",
    "if two consecutive sites are occupied ( @xmath37 ) , this initial condition will be called the two - particle initial condition ( tpic ) .",
    "we also simulated the stochastic evolution starting from a single particle in the whole system ( @xmath38 ) , which will be called the single - particle initial condition ( spic ) .",
    "simulations starting from either the tpic or the spic will be referred to as defect simulations . in defect simulations ,",
    "the system size @xmath15 should be large enough so that no particle can hit the boundary up to @xmath35 to ensure that the system size is effectively infinite .    in static simulations",
    ", we measured the density @xmath39 and the survival probability @xmath40 , where @xmath41 means the average over all realizations and @xmath42 is the kronecker delta symbol , which should not be confused with the critical exponent @xmath43 introduced later .",
    "we will also study the density averaged over surviving samples , @xmath44 , which is calculated as @xmath45 .    in defect simulations",
    ", we measured the average number of particles @xmath46 , the survival probability @xmath47 , and the square of the distance between the two most distant particles averaged over surviving samples , @xmath48 . note that we use different symbols for the survival probability depending on which simulation scheme ( static or defect )",
    "is under consideration .",
    "according to the scaling theory ( for a review , see , e. g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 near the critical point @xmath27 is described as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are scaling functions that are not singular at the origin , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath10 are critical exponents .    when the spic is used , @xmath59 for all @xmath22 because of the modulo-2 conservation of the number of particles in the system .",
    "obviously , @xmath60 in the case of the spic . in",
    "what follows , @xmath50 exclusively means the survival probability of defect simulations with the tpic .",
    "when the tpic is used , @xmath61 which gives the scaling relation @xmath62 .",
    "likewise , @xmath63 and @xmath44 are expected to behave as @xmath64 where @xmath43 is another critical exponent , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are scaling functions . since @xmath67 for @xmath29 , @xmath43 should be equal to @xmath9 . in general",
    ", @xmath68 need not be equal to @xmath69 , but the duality relation proven in ref .",
    "@xcite implies that @xmath68 should be equal to @xmath69 for the baw2 .",
    "also , there is the generalized hyperscaling relation  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dimensions in which the system is embedded ( in this paper , @xmath71 is always 1 ) .",
    "note that the above relation is insensitive to the initial conditions of the defect simulations , although @xmath56 and @xmath58 individually may be non - universal .    to estimate the critical exponents systematically",
    ", one generally uses the effective exponents defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant ( in this paper , we set @xmath74 ) .",
    "in general , there are corrections to scaling , and the measured quantities at the critical point are expected to behave as @xmath75 where @xmath76 s and @xmath77 s are constants and @xmath4 s , which will be called the leading corrections to the scaling exponents ( lcses ) , should be positive .",
    "accordingly , the effective exponents at criticality become @xmath78 if we plot an effective exponent , for instance @xmath79 , as a function of @xmath80 with the correct value of @xmath81 , @xmath82 should approach the @xmath83 axis with finite slope at the critical point .",
    "furthermore , if the system is in the active ( absorbing ) phase , effective exponents should eventually veer up ( down ) after following a straight line for some time region .",
    "thus , if the goal of obtaining high - precision estimates of the critical exponents is to be achieved , correct information about the lcse is indispensable .    for models belonging to the di class , the lcse is normally belived to be 1",
    "; for an example , see eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .",
    "however , numerical data seem to suggest that corrections to scaling for certain quantities are stronger than expected . hence",
    ", we feel it necessary to find the lcse more systematically . to this end",
    ", we introduce the leading - correction - to - scaling function @xmath84 as @xmath85 in a similar fashion , we can define @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath50 , @xmath48 , and @xmath63 , respectively . by a straightforward calculation using eqs .   and",
    ", the long time behavior of @xmath84 at criticality becomes @xmath89 thus , without prior knowledge of the critical exponents , we can estimate the lcse by investigating the leading - correction - to - scaling function .",
    "although we do not know @xmath27 _ a priori _ in most cases , the leading - correction - to - scaling functions and critical exponents , as well as @xmath27 , are obtained at the same time by using the following iterative procedure : at first , we make a rough guess about the lcse , for example , @xmath90 .",
    "although the value of the lcse can be wrong , one can manage to estimate the critical point with a certain error by observing how a plot of the effective exponent vs @xmath91 behaves .",
    "now , we calculate the @xmath92 function and estimate @xmath4 at the obtained critical point in the above step .",
    "then , with the @xmath4 obtained from the @xmath92 function , we re - estimate the critical point from longer - time simulations by analyzing plots of the effective exponents against @xmath0 . at this step , the accuracy of the critical point becomes improved , so we re - estimate @xmath4 by using the @xmath92 function at the critical point .",
    "we repeat the above steps until the resulting values of the @xmath4 , @xmath27 , and exponents become consistent with the scaling theory . in this paper",
