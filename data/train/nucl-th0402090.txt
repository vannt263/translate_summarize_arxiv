    "it is an interesting question how the behaviour of hadrons changes in a dense hadronic medium .",
    "one of the driving ideas is that chiral symmetry is expected to become partially restored with increasing density or temperature .",
    "therefore the spectral functions of hadrons in their dependence on the thermodynamic parameters of the hadronic environment are of special interest .",
    "they directly show the possible effects on the mass and decay properties of the particles .",
    "one of the experimental accesses to observe the spectral functions in - matter is provided through the study of electron - positron- or muon anti - muon pairs , called dileptons @xcite both in hadron  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "the advantage of such electromagnetic probes instead of strong interacting particles , like pions or kaons , is that one gets information directly from the centre of the interaction zone . above invariant masses of 400 mev the pairs",
    "are mainly produced through the decay of vector - mesons like the @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson .",
    "additional contributions come from bremsstrahlung and final - state dalitz - decays of other resonances , like the @xmath4-meson , which in part are controlled by other observations .",
    "presently all nuclear collision experiments @xcite observe a significantly enhanced dilepton yield in the invariant mass range below the light vector - meson masses compared to straight extrapolations from elementary processes , like proton - proton scattering .",
    "several mechanisms , especially a lowering of the @xmath0-meson mass or an increase of its damping width , were proposed to explain the experimental facts @xcite .",
    "additional experiments for photo - production off nuclei are planned , where one likes to investigate the @xmath5 channel @xcite . despite the perturbation through the final state interaction of the @xmath6-meson @xcite it",
    "will still be possible to isolate the @xmath1-meson component because the competing @xmath0-meson process is highly suppressed .",
    "ever since the early considerations of vector - mesons in dense matter @xcite much effort has been devoted to study the properties of the @xmath0-meson , which strongly couples to the two - pion channel . however , with a few exceptions , e.g. @xcite , the in - medium properties of the pion are commonly neglected , just employing unperturbed free pion states .",
    "furthermore so far there are only few attempts to study the in - medium properties of the @xmath1-meson @xcite .",
    "thus , a more realistic determination of the in - matter pion cloud permits to investigate the dependence of the vector - meson properties on the various components of the pion spectral function in the medium . compared to a schematic three level model for the pion modes studied by wachs",
    "@xcite we use a scheme of coupled dyson equations in which the pionic degrees of freedom are modified selfconsistently through the coupling to the nucleon and the @xmath2(1232)-resonance .",
    "all selfenergies are determined within a truncated two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action formalism ( @xmath3-functional ) in their full dependence on energy and three momentum .",
    "this guarantees conservation laws of the theory to be fulfilled on the level of expectation values @xcite despite the approximations employed . from the in - medium spectral function of the pion we are able to calculate the modified spectral functions for the @xmath0-meson as well as for the @xmath1-meson in coupled scheme .",
    "thereby the process @xmath7 leads to a strong interplay between both vector - mesons .",
    "in particular the @xmath1-width is very sensitive to the space - like , i.e. low energy component of the pion caused by its coupling to nucleon nucleon - hole states . for a realistic treatment of this component migdal s short range correlations @xcite are important .",
    "these rpa - type correlations shift the spectral strength to higher energies , such that pion condensation is prevented . in order to concentrate on the effects due to the modified pion we neglected direct couplings of the vector - mesons to the baryonic currents .",
    "the latter have been investigated by several authors @xcite , who found a multicomponent structure for the in - medium @xmath0 meson which is yet absent in our approach .",
    "dealing with vector - mesons requires to consider current conservation on the correlator level .",
    "this is ensured by a projector formalism @xcite which constructs a four - transversal polarisation tensor .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way : we first summarise the essential definitions in the realtime formalism used in the calculations at finite temperature and density .",
    "then we present the model for the in - medium pion coupled to the the baryonic degrees of freedom .",
    "afterwards we show how to derive a four - transversal and thus a current conserving polarisation tensor by means of a projector formalism .",
    "for the so obtained in - medium spectral functions of the vector - mesons we use the vector - dominance concept in order to calculate the effect of our results on the dilepton rates .",
    "the different decay contributions as well as the effect of possible mass - shifts of the vector - mesons in the dilepton spectra are investigated .",
    "a discussion of our results concludes the paper .",
    "interested in all spectral properties as a function of real energies the realtime formalism @xcite will be used rather than the matsubara technique . within this formalism all two - point functions such as the propagator throughout the paper . ] or selfenergies take four components , e.g. @xmath8 depending on the order of the fermionic ( upper sign ) or bosonic ( lower sign ) field operators @xmath9 appearing in the expectation values .",
    "the space - time coordinates are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the time- , respectively , anti - time - ordering is symolized by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the dyson equations then become matrix equations with respect to the \\{@xmath14 } labels ( placement on the closed time contour ) .    for",
    "a uniform medium in thermal equilibrium one can exploit the standard simplification by going to the space - time fourier - transformation @xmath15 of all quantities , where @xmath16 is the four momentum .",
    "then the coupled dyson equations simply become algebraic and it is sufficient to solve for the retarded ( or advanced ) dyson equation , since all four components can be deduced from this by thermal fermi - dirac or bose - einstein factors arising from the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition .",
    "thereby the retarded and advanced green functions follow from @xmath17 with the kms conditions @xmath18 where the spectral function and thermal weights are given by @xmath19 with temperature @xmath12 , chemical potential @xmath20 and the energy @xmath21 . the above listed relations for @xmath22 likewise apply for all equilibrium two - point functions , i.e. also for the selfenergies .",
    "they are also written in a way that they apply to dirac spinors or vector fields , whereby all quantities additionally become dirac - matrix or lorentz - tensor structures , respectively .",

    "the propagators and selfenergies of the baryons are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath27 , while we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the corresponding quantities for the meson fields . in selfconsistent two - particle irreducible ( 2pi )",

    "this functional is given by a truncated set of closed diagrams in accordance with the interaction lagrangian where all lines denote dressed , i.e. selfconsistent propagators .",
    "the selfenergies result as functional variations with respect to the propagators , i.e. @xmath30}{\\delta ig(y , x ) }          \\qquad\\mbox{or}\\qquad          -i\\pi(x , y)=\\frac{\\delta i\\phi[g , d]}{\\delta id(y , x)}.            \\label{selfenergy}\\ ] ] this implies an opening of a corresponding propagator line in the diagrams of @xmath3 . for the resulting set of coupled dyson equations such 2pi approaches guarantee that even in a partial resummation of a single class of diagrams the conservation laws which are related to the symmetries of the system are fulfilled on the level of expectation values @xcite .",
    "the present investigations are restricted to spin as well as isospin symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this implies vanishing chemical potentials for all mesons in the light flavour sector .",
    "all selfconsistent calculations of the spectral functions are carried out numerically as a function of energy and momentum on a two dimensional grid of 5 mev by 5 mev / c resolution using an iterative procedure .      in the baryon sector",
    "the nucleon and the @xmath2(1232)-resonance are included .",
    "the pion is considered as goldstone boson of chiral symmetry which , in lowest approximation in pion - energy , leads to @xmath31-wave couplings to the baryonic pseudo - vector currents together with a minor @xmath32-wave term which we ignore . for the energies",
    "involved we approximate the spinor structure of the baryons by the non - relativistic limit , while the kinematics is kept in the relativistic form . this approximation allows to handle the spin-3/2-structure of the @xmath2-resonance in a simple way .",
    "furthermore , for the investigated range in excitation energies we can safely use the no - sea approximation for the baryons . thus we neglect processes involving anti - baryons and set the baryon spectral functions to zero for negative energies .",
    "the following non - relativistic form of the interaction lagrangian @xmath33 is used with the spinor - field operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the nucleon and @xmath2-resonance . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the vectors of pauli matrices in spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "likewise , the vector @xmath38 defines the three spin - coupling matrices of spin 3/2 and 1/2 to spin 1 , while @xmath39 is the same in isospin - space . in our scheme",
    "we neglect pion self - interactions ( @xmath40 ) which give rise to selfenergy diagrams of sunset type @xcite as well as contributions from @xmath41 excitations . both are of some importance at temperatures above 80 mev , where they would even further broaden the pion spectral functions .",
    "furthermore we supplement an exponential formfactor @xmath42 at the @xmath43nn- and @xmath43n@xmath2-vertices .",
    "values of @xmath44= 440 mev and @xmath45 are required for a decent fit of the pion - nucleon phase - shifts in the 33-chanal can be chosen above 700 mev . ] and a proper vacuum spectral function of the @xmath2-resonance .",
    "for @xmath46 we use 0.007 @xmath47 @xcite .    for the chosen lagrangian mean - field terms drop out and the first diagrams for the @xmath3-functional in the baryon - pion sector which we use are :    phibaryon @xmath48    the lines represent the fully dressed propagators , while apart from the formfactor ( [ formfactor ] ) the vertices remain bare .",
    "not all of the selfenergy terms obtained through ( [ selfenergy ] ) are of equal importance .",
    "for instance the @xmath2-@xmath43-loop contribution to the nucleon selfenergy is found negligible compared to the @xmath49-@xmath43-loop and thus neglected in the production runs .",
    "the retarded pion selfenergy can be obtained from a dispersion relation which in no - sea approximation does not require any renormalization @xmath50 interested in the pion modes a complete determination of the baryon selfenergies @xmath51 is beyond the scope and not the aim of the present model .",
    "for simplicity we drop the real parts of @xmath51 , which would require a renormalization procedure within a selfconsistent resummation scheme @xcite . however the normalisation of the corresponding spectral functions is restored in each iteration step .",
    "as is well known , the coupling of the pion to nucleon - hole ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53-states provides a strong softening of the pion modes already at normal nuclear densities .",
    "since there are no indications from experiment for a pion condensate at normal nuclear density one has to include a repulsive force which shifts the spectral strength up to higher energies .",
    "this can be achieved by a repulsive short - range interaction between the baryons first introduced by migdal @xcite    migdalvertex1    ( 25,12 )    migdalvertex2    ( 25,12 )    migdalvertex3    ( 25,12 )    for the migdal parameters we used @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath56 without any form factor . at a momentum scale of 200 mev / c for the relevant @xmath52 excitations-@xmath1 mixing in matter ,",
    "are mainly determined by @xmath57 . ]",
    "this choice is compatible with the recent parameter set of suzuki @xcite and nakano @xcite who calibrated it on gamow - teller transition strengths .",
    "these correlations are to be included in the retarded pion selfenergy in form of an rpa - resummation with particle - hole loops    repulsion @xmath58    where also mixtures with the @xmath2-resonance , i.e @xmath53-loops need to be considered . in the non - relativistic limit for the spinor structure of the baryons ,",
    "only the spatial components of the dirac matrices survive in all loops which , by symmetry arguments , are diagonal ( for a fully relativistic treatment cf .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , apart from a @xmath59-factor due to the difference between the pion - baryon coupling and the migdal interaction the basic loops for the rpa - resummation are given by the normal pion selfenergy diagrams resulting from the @xmath3-functional ( [ selfenergy ] )    selfnuc @xmath60    thus , the rpa - resummation can be done without further problems .",
    "with the three possible vertices one finally obtains @xcite @xmath61 for the retarded pion selfenergy . the corresponding results together with those for the pion spectral function are shown in the figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig4 ] .    in the selfenergy and spectral function",
    "we see the effect of the coupling to the different baryonic excitations .",
    "the on - shell pole broadens and is shifted towards lower energies due to the net - attraction of the interaction in this kinematical region .",
    "this component strongly mixes with the @xmath53 component which leads to the shoulders around this peak .",
    "this component appears in the time - like region for low momenta , while it traverses to the space - like region for higher momenta . at low energies",
    "an entirely space - like pion component appears due to @xmath52 excitations . from the kinematics",
    "it is clear that this component stays in the space - like region for all momenta .",
    "such space - like pion modes have to be interpreted as a scattering process on the baryons in the matter mediated by the exchange of pions . due to this component , the pion spectral function has non - vanishing strength at all energies , such that in all processes where pions are involved all thresholds disappear . due to the short - range migdal repulsion",
    "there is no spectral component where the peak position decreases towards lower energies when one increases the momentum .",
    "the form of the spectral function turns out to be very sensitive on values for the migdal parameters and the formfactor @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , in the literature one finds quite different procedures to incorporate the formfactor in the migdal resummation .",
    "some of them include formfactors also for the migdal - vertices @xcite .",
    "we followed the approach from ref .",
    "@xcite with formfactor - free migdal vertices .",
    "the difference between these two techniques turns out to have a great effect on the shape of the pion spectral function for momenta in the order of 400 mev . for higher temperatures",
    "all structures are smoothed out and the value of the selfenergy even decreases because of limited number of available nucleons to scatter .      in this chapter",
    "we study the influence of the medium - modified pion - modes on the spectral functions of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons .",
    "the widths of these resonances are generated through the decay into two pions in the case of the @xmath0-meson , respectively three pions for the @xmath1-meson .",
    "for the @xmath1-meson we choose the indirect decay via the @xmath0-meson ( the so called gell - mann , sharp and wagner ( gsw ) process @xcite ) because , as shown by theileis @xcite , this is the dominant contribution in vacuum .",
    "the interaction lagrangian defining the vertices is given by @xcite @xmath63 for a review see @xcite .",
    "in this sector we are lead to the following @xmath3-functional approximation    phi - meson @xmath64    from the point of view of a @xmath3-derivable approximation we neglected the coupling of the @xmath0-@xmath1-loop back to the pion .",
    "this process is expected to contribute only marginally to the low energy region of the pion spectrum , which turns out to be the most relevant part to determine the width of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "therefore only the following retarded selfenergies are included : + @xmath65    srho2pi @xmath66    somegarhopi @xmath67    the correlation between @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson modes results from the @xmath1-meson selfenergy ( [ somegarhopi ] ) and the reverse process encoded in the coupling of the @xmath0-meson to the @xmath1-@xmath43-loop    srhoomegapi @xmath68    which both are included selfconsistently . since the model omits higher lying degrees of freedom the in - medium changes of the real parts of the vector - meson selfenergies are less precisely determined within the model space .",
    "therefore we drop them , while restoring the normalisation of the spectral functions at each iteration step in the further analysis . in a later section",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the results on a possible change of the vector - meson masses in matter .",
    "the resulting polarisation - tensors ( [ srho2pi ] - [ srhoomegapi ] ) have to be four - transversal because of current conservation . in normal perturbation theory",
    "this is guaranteed order by order . in the dyson approach , where one sums up a restricted subclass of diagrams to infinite order , one generally violates ward identities on the correlator level .",
    "thus the polarisation tensor may contain four - longitudinal components @xmath69 , which have to be absent and which may lead to the propagation of unphysical degrees of freedom . from general grounds , this deficiency can be cured by corresponding vertex corrections . without further approximations , however , this leads to a presently intractable scheme of bethe - salpeter equations which accounts for the required @xmath70-channel exchanges required by crossing symmetry .",
    "we circumvent this problem in the following way . from transport considerations",
    "@xcite it is known that such polarisation tensors have at least two relaxation times .",
    "because of charge conservation , one of these times has to be infinite , implying that the component @xmath71 vanishes exactly for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while the second relaxation time is clearly finite .",
    "such a result can never be reached in a truncated dyson - resummation scheme where all relaxation times are finite , because they are determined by the damping - time scale of the dressed propagators involved in the loops . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial components of the polarisation tensor , given by the autocorrelation of spatial currents , have solely finite and short correlation times which can be expected to be safely approximated within a dyson resummation scheme .",
    "therefore our strategy assumes the spatial components of the polarisation tensors @xmath74 to be given by the selfconsistent loops , while the time - components are to be corrected such that the full tensor becomes four - transversal .",
    "this is achieved by using a projection technique where the full tensors ( [ srho2pi ] - [ srhoomegapi ] ) are decomposed into a four - longitudinal part @xmath75 and two four - transversal parts @xmath76 and @xmath77 which are three - longitudinal and three - transversal , respectively , @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the metric tensor , whereas @xmath80 and @xmath81 have vanishing time components .",
    "we do not specify the @xmath75 part any further , since this part has just to be dropped due to current conservation .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be calculated solely from the spatial parts of the polarisation tensors using the following traces @xmath82",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] due to the traces , the complicated lorentz - structure of the interaction vertices ( [ l - vector ] ) in the loops can be reduced entirely to expressions involving the four- , respectively , three - vector squares @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , etc . of the external and internal momenta involved in the loops .",
    "furthermore , three - longitudinal and transverse modes decouple such that the corresponding spectral functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 are directly given by the scalar functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the corresponding components of the polarisation tensors .      with the dressed pion spectral function from section [ subsect - pindelta ] , the three - longitudinal respectively three - transversal polarisation tensors and spectral function of both vector - mesons can now be calculated . in figs .",

    "the main effect towards finite densities and/or finite temperatures is the disappearance of thresholds present in the free particle kinematics for the pions in the loops .",
    "the spectral strength starts right at zero energy for both vector - mesons , though less visible for the @xmath1-meson due to the smallness of the coupling .",
    "this has significant consequences for the low mass region of the corresponding dilepton yields ( cf .",
    "next section ) .",
    "the temperature has no great influence on the @xmath0-meson spectrum , while the @xmath1-meson width increases significantly .",
    "for the latter effect indirectly the nucleon  nucleon - hole excitations are of special importance as discussed later .     +      using vector - dominance",

    "to nuclear collisions in mind , we use the vacuum expressions for the photon- and lepton - propagators , since these particles interact only weakly , such that they do not get modified by the surrounding medium .",
    "in addition , we used the coupling constants from @xcite in order to describe the partial decay width of both mesons into dileptons .",
    "one can see that , due to the thermal weight and the broad spectral functions , the dilepton spectra are essentially falling over the whole energy range",
    ". this would clearly be different if the vacuum spectral function for the @xmath1-meson had been used here .",
    "the @xmath94-spectrum has a threshold at twice the muon mass . at higher invariant mass",
    "both di - lepton spectra merge , because then the muon mass becomes negligible in comparison with the energy .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath1-meson are hardly visible in the total spectra because of its increased width . for equal widths of both mesons",
    "the contributions of the @xmath1-meson falls below that of the @xmath0-meson by one order of magnitude because of the smaller partial decay width into dileptons .    in the following we explicitly analyse the influence of the various components of the pion spectral function on the vector - mesons and thus on the dilepton spectra .",
    "formally we do this by splitting the spectral function of the vector - meson into the various components related to the different processes feeding into this vector - meson channel .",
    "thus , decomposing the total damping width into partial widths @xmath100 the dilepton yield can be brought into a breit - wigner like form with partial in- and out - widths @xmath101 ( suppressing the tensor structure of spectral function and polarisation tensor which leads to a degeneracy factor 3 for vector particles ) . here , @xmath102 is the dilepton decay width of vector - meson @xmath103 .",
    "we start the discussion of the effects on the @xmath1-meson . in the medium",
    "there are three major processes contributing to its damping width , illustrated by perturbative `` time - flow '' diagrams where the time is running from left to right and vertical lines denote a virtual space - like propagator , which mediates a two - body interaction : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath104 + here the subsequent decay of the @xmath1-meson into the virtual time - like photon and its final decay into the lepton pair is not illustrated . in the selfconsistent calculation",
    "all these processes are included automatically by using dressed propagators .",
    "for the first process ( f ) , @xmath105 , the @xmath1-meson is formed by the fusion of a @xmath0-meson with a quasi - real , in - medium pion .",

    "the process ( s ) in ( [ om - processes ] ) corresponds to the scattering @xmath0n@xmath108n mediated by a virtual , i.e. space - like pion exchange . in view of the pion modes at zero temperature ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we isolate this space - like component by a cut on the far space - like region with pion loop momenta with @xmath109 in ( [ somegarhopi ] ) . at @xmath110 mev",
    "this separation is less evident in view of the broad structure of the pion spectral function ( fig .",
    "[ pion - spec ] ) .",

    "[ omega - div ] somewhat depend on this cut .",
    "in addition to the fusion width ( f ) , which constitutes just a temperature dependent modification of the vacuum width ( e.g. accounted for by schneider and weise @xcite ) a genuine in - medium process , namely the scattering process ( s ) , contributes with comparable strength at the nominal resonance position .",
    "the `` daliz''-decay of the @xmath0-meson ( d ) dominates the low mass region .    in summary of this analysis : a major portion to the @xmath1 spectrum results from processes ( s ) which are not accounted for in the simple on - shell treatment .",
    "these contributions , however , sensitively depend on the in - medium properties of the virtual pion cloud , which certainly needs further clarifying investigations before quantitative conclusions can be drawn .    the same type of processes as in ( [ om - processes ] ) also occur for the @xmath0-meson just interchanging @xmath0 with @xmath1 , listed in the @xmath0-meson decomposition given in fig .",

    "the slight deviations to our results can be understood by the change of the vector - meson masses in medium in their models as discussed in chapter [ mass - red ] .",
    "compared to the @xmath123-@xmath1-mixing model of saito et al .",
    "@xcite we can not account for level - level repulsion in our model , as we do not include the real parts of the vector - meson selfenergies .",
    "altogether the @xmath1-meson width sensitively depends on the properties on the in - medium pion cloud .",
    "an increase of the cut - off scale @xmath44 of the @xmath124-formfactor ( [ formfactor ] ) for instance would significantly enhance the rpa pion - modes and induce a further increase of the @xmath1-meson width .",
    "once the @xmath1-meson width increases beyond 50 mev , it loses its prominent peak - structure and its component can no longer be easily resolved in the dilepton spectrum due to the dominance of the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "our description of the vector - meson sector is not as complete as to permit definite predictions for the mass shifts of the vector - mesons , i.e. the real parts of the vector - meson selfenergies .",
    "this is a subject of current debate and investigations and requires a more complete model space within hadronic descriptions @xcite or support from qcd , e.g. in form of sum - rule constraints @xcite . for simplicity the real parts of the vector - meson selfenergies",
    "are put to zero in the results presented above . on the other hand",
    "we can explore the effect of mass shifts by simply changing the masses by hand . for the following discussion we concentrate on the damping widths ( longitudinal and transverse ) of the vector - mesons at the in - medium mass position @xmath125 for a typical momentum of 200 mev / c given by @xmath126     +    a phenomenological lowering of the @xmath0-meson mass , e.g. within the brown - rho scaling scheme @xcite ,",
    "has been considered by many authors .",
    "this leads to an enhanced strength in the mass region below the @xmath0-meson vacuum mass . from the calculations",
    "thus far the mass dependence of the vector - meson damping widths at @xmath121 and saturation density can approximately be read off by i.e. inspecting figs .",
    "[ fig.8 ] and [ fig.12 ] .",
    "they predict marginal changes for the @xmath0-meson width .",
    "thus , the entire @xmath0-meson strength will be shifted , e.g. towards lower masses , with the extra benefit that the thermal weight factor in ( [ d r ] ) enhances the dilepton yield by about a factor @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath1-meson shows sensitive changes of its damping width as a function of its invariant mass . since the only channel , to which the @xmath1-meson couples to in our model , is the @xmath43-@xmath0-channel",
    ", we expect @xmath128 to depend sensitively only on the mass difference or ratio between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson masses .",
    "the explicit results for the dependence on @xmath129 for @xmath121 and normal nuclear density can be found in the figs .",
    "[ mass - omega ] and [ mass - rho ] for the @xmath1-meson and for the partial width @xmath130 of the @xmath0-meson , respectively . due to the dominance of the @xmath117-annihilation channel ,",
    "the latter has minor impact on the total @xmath0-meson width .",
    "the displayed dependence follows expectations from phase - space arguments .",
    "our results compare favourably with the calculations of klingl and weise @xcite and lutz et.al .",
    "@xcite , who used qcd sum rules or the low density theorem for the determination of the mass shifts .",
    "although in the klingl and weise result @xcite the mass of the @xmath1-meson is lowered by 15% relative to the @xmath0-meson mass , which would infer a much smaller width , one has to take into account that in those calculations a much broader @xmath0-meson ( @xmath131 mev ) was used inducing a compensating increase of the @xmath1-width .",
    "we also studied the vector - meson mass dependence at finite temperature . in fig .",
    "[ mass - comp ] we compare the width of the @xmath1-meson with a mass reduced by 15% to the width without such a reduction and @xmath132 . ] .",
    "we find that the overall offset is nearly the same for all temperatures .",
    "according to this , the relative effect decreases for higher temperatures .",
    "this can be understood because kinematical effects , like mass shifts , are of less importance for broad spectral functions . in fig .",
    "[ mass - dilepton ] , we show the effect of this mass shift on the dilepton spectra . we observe that the peak structure becomes more prominent because of the smaller width of the @xmath1-meson and that the total rate is enhanced .",
    "this enhancement is due to the thermal weight which increases exponentially towards lower temperature .",
    "we have investigated the in - medium effects on the light vector - mesons due to the modification of the pion modes in nuclear matter at finite density and temperature . to isolate this effect only the coupling of the vector - mesons to the pion modes has been considered so far .",
    "the direct coupling to baryonic currents along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite within a selfconsistent scheme will be the subject of a forthcoming study .    within a selfconsistent dyson resummation scheme ,",
    "the nucleon and @xmath2(1232)-resonance were included as the main degrees of freedom in the baryon sector . besides the direct @xmath124 and @xmath133 couplings , accounted for in selfconsistent selfenergies up to one - loop order , also the short - range rpa correlations of migdal type @xcite",
    "were included in order to get a realistic behaviour of the low energy pion modes .",
    "while for the meson - baryon couplings a non - relativistic approximation was employed , the kinematics of all particles was treated relativistically .",
    "the so obtained in - medium spectral functions of the pion provide the source for the vector - meson selfenergies through the @xmath134 and @xmath135 coupling vertices .",
    "while the former already induces the strong damping width of the @xmath0-meson in vacuum , the latter becomes essential for the strong vector - meson `` mixing '' at finite densities and temperatures .",
    "consequences for the resulting in - matter dilepton spectra from the electromagnetic decay of the vector - mesons have been discussed .",
    "the polarisation - tensor for the vector - mesons has to be four - transversal such that no unphysical degrees of freedom are propagated .",
    "this was achieved by a projector technique ( see eq .",
    "( [ projektion ] ) ff . ) which provides the three - longitudinal and three - transversal parts , respectively .",
    "these two parts are identical in the vacuum due to lorentz invariance , while they may differ in the medium .    as an important result of our investigations we find a strong mixing of both vector - meson modes in - matter .",
    "it is induced by the low - lying space - like pion modes which essentially arise from the coupling to particle - hole excitations . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath1-meson damping width drastically broadens both , with increasing baryon density and temperature reaching values of 100 mev or even above .",
    "the quantitative results on the in - medium properties of the vector mesons still depend on the model assumptions and parameters for the in - medium pion physics such as the migdal parameters and the formfactors for the @xmath124 and @xmath133 vertices . despite more than two decades of work in this field ,",
    "the in - medium properties of the pion are not yet conclusively settled .",
    "thus , further improvements , especially concerning the @xmath52-component , are required for a quantitative understanding of the in - medium broadening of the light vector - meson spectral functions , especially of the @xmath1-meson . here",
    "other techniques like the recent calculations from lutz and korpa @xcite are to be mentioned which may offer alternative and quantitative strategies to understand the spectral function of the pion and thus provide a reliable basis for the calculations of the vector - mesons properties .",
    "as our approach qualitatively incorporates most of the relevant contributions to the pion spectral function , all qualitative features should already be visible in our results .",
    "even if the situation at zero temperature and saturation density may eventually become quantitatively settled , the extrapolation of the effective interactions to finite temperatures may requires further adaptions .    the broad @xmath1-meson distributions , as found in our calculations ,",
    "will make it difficult to isolate this in - medium component in dilepton spectra .",
    "it will be detected in competition with the much stronger electromagnetic decay rates of the @xmath0-meson . therefore complementary experiments which directly isolate the @xmath1-component e.g. partly through hadronic channels , such as in the recent taps - experiments @xcite , are vital to clarify the situation . in nuclear collision experiments ,",
    "one further has to face the fact that contributions from final - state interaction always arise .",
    "such asymptotic state vector - mesons show the signature of the corresponding vacuum spectral functions and thus may hide the here addressed in - matter components .",
