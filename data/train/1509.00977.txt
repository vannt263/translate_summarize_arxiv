    "frequency division multiplexing ( gfdm ) is a recently proposed modulation technique which is amongst the candidate modulation formats to be used in future communication standards .",
    "this has many reasons .",
    "firstly , it has been shown to possess lower out - of - band ( oob ) radiation , compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm)@xcite .",
    "the reason for high oob radiation for ofdm compared to gfdm is that ofdm has rectangular pulse , which leads to large tails in the frequency domain , whereas pulse shapes other than the rectangular pulse can be utilized in gfdm .",
    "pulses that have better frequency localization enable lower oob radiation which may benefit cognitive radio based dynamic spectrum access solutions among others .",
    "furthermore , the tail biting technique used in gfdm make the cyclic prefix length to be independent of the length of the transmit and receiver filters .",
    "this reduces the overhead caused by the cyclic prefix , which can be significant since short signal length is required for low latency applications .",
    "another advantage of using gfdm is related to its flexible frame structure . by changing the number of time slots or subcarriers in a gfdm frame",
    ", it can cover both cp - ofdm or sc - fde @xcite , depending on the requirements of the application .",
    "these merits of gfdm makes it a strong physical layer modulation technique candidate for future communication standards .    despite its abovementioned advantages , gfdm has also some drawbacks .",
    "one of these is that for a gfdm scheme with matched filter ( mf ) receiver , if no inter - carrier interference ( ici ) or inter - symbol interference ( isi ) is desired , pulses such as rectangular or dirichlet pulses should be used , which do not have good time - frequency localization .",
    "in fact , this results from balian - low theorem which states that there is no time - frequency well localized pulse when the lattice density is equal to 1 and this theorem can not be circumvented if quadrature - amplitude modulation ( qam ) is used as in gfdm .",
    "therefore , zero - forcing ( zf ) , minimum mean square error ( mmse ) or successive interference cancellation ( sic ) receivers are employed in gfdm , to cancel ici or isi @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , such receivers also come with some drawbacks .",
    "zero - forcing receiver suffers from noise enhancement , which will degrade the error rate performance .",
    "mmse receiver aims a balance between noise and the interference .",
    "however , it does not achieve capacity without sic .",
    "sic receiver increases the complexity of gfdm receiver further .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to employ pulses that have good localization in time and frequency with mf receiver , with no isi or ici , an extension of gfdm with offset - qam ( oqam ) , is proposed as windowed cyclic prefix circular oqam ( wcp - coqam ) in @xcite .",
    "it has also been called as ts - oqam - gfdm in @xcite .",
    "the reason behind using oqam instead of qam is to circumvent the balian - low theorem by lattice staggering .",
    "this approach is first used to synthesize orthogonal signals in @xcite ,  @xcite . until recently ,",
    "such modulation schemes are referred to as oqam / ofdm or staggered multitone ( smt ) .",
    "the proposal of wcp - coqam is to achieve the aforementioned advantages of gfdm and at the same time to use pulses with good time frequency localization with mf receiver thanks to the use of oqam .",
    "the advantage of using pulses with good time - frequency localization stems from their robustness against time - frequency dispersive channels or frequency synchronization errors such as carrier frequency offset ( cfo ) and their lower oob emissions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "although in @xcite , wcp - coqam is described with various performance metrics , no details are given in terms of the design of the pulse shape to be employed .",
    "the authors directly use the standard squared root - raised cosine spectrum pulse . in this paper , we will show that a pulse shape that satisfies the orthogonality conditions for oqam - ofdm will also satisfy orthogonality with wcp - coqam for a special selection of the phase term in the transmitted signal of wcp - coqam .",
    "therefore , efficient and orthogonal pulse shape design algorithms that are proposed for oqam - ofdm @xcite can also be used for wcp - coqam .",
    "the organization of the paper will be as follows .",
    "first , the signal models for oqam - ofdm and wcp - coqam will be given in section [ sec : signal_model ] .",
    "in section [ sec : orth_cond ] , the orthogonality conditions for oqam - ofdm and wcp - coqam will be stated . the proof that a pulse satisfying orthogonality with oqam - ofdm will also satisfy orthogonality with wcp - coqam",
    "is presented in appendix [ sec : proof_eqv_oqam_ofdm_wcp_coqam ] .",
    "section [ sec : sim_res ] verifies the proof with simulation based results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "note that a gfdm or wcp - coqam frame is a block that consists of multiple time slots and a single cyclic prefix .",
    "such a frame structure is explained in detail in @xcite . moreover , since it has been stated in @xcite that there is not a unique selection for the phase term @xmath17 for oqam modulation schemes , we prefer to choose that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 if @xmath20 is even and @xmath21 if @xmath20 is odd . such a selection of @xmath17 term will yield a transmitted signal for wcp - coqam that has a similar form as the transmitted signal for oqam - ofdm given in ( [ eqn : oqam_transmitted_signal ] ) . in that case",
    ", we will be able to relate the orthogonality conditions for oqam - ofdm written according to the signal model in ( [ eqn : oqam_transmitted_signal ] ) to the orthogonality conditions for wcp - coqam . for @xmath18",

    "this proof is considered to be necessary , although in @xcite , it has been stated that pulse shaping filters that are designed for oqam - ofdm will directly satisfy orthogonality with wcp - coqam without such a proof .",

    "monte - carlo trials continue until 100 frame errors are collected . with these parameters ,",
    "error rate performances are obtained as in figure  [ fig : ser_snr_gaussian_awgn_alpha0.1 ] .    ]    to illustrate the performance with a nonorthogonal pulse , the error rate performance of wcp - coqam with rc pulse is included . as can be observed from figure  [ fig : ser_snr_gaussian_awgn_alpha0.1 ]",
    "there is a performance loss when non - orthogonal rc pulse is used .",
    "the curve with solid black line indicates the approximate theoretical awgn performance of ofdm , whose closed form expression is borrowed from @xcite . as expected , the ofdm error rate performance obtained with monte - carlo based simulations are the same as the theoretical error rate curve . moreover , it can be observed that the error rate performance of wcp - coqam with orthogonalized guassian or rc pulse with dzt based algorithm ( corresponding curves are named as dzt - gaussian or dzt - rc ) gives the same performance as ofdm .",
    "this verifies that the dzt based algorithm defined for oqam - ofdm also yields orthogonal pulses for wcp - coqam .",
