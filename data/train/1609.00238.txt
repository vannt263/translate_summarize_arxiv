    "long ago aharonov and bohm @xcite proposed `` en passant '' an extension of the electromagnetic lagrangian , obtained by adding a term @xmath6 to the minimal gauge - invariant lagrangian which leads to maxwell equations .",
    "a previous attempt in this direction had also been made by ohmura @xcite .",
    "this modified electromagnetic theory has been recently re - analysed by van vlaenderen and waser @xcite , hively and giakos @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an hamiltonian formalism is employed , in @xcite a quaternion formalism , in @xcite a standard three - dimensional vector formalism .    in this work",
    "we obtain new insights into this extended theory using a standard four - vectors formalism , which is in our opinion more effective , and allows to find some useful explicit expressions missing from the other approaches .",
    "we obtain a simple , consistent generalization of the maxwell equations which is independent from the coupling @xmath7 and has the important property of charge conservation censorship : although the equations are compatible with sources which do not respect local charge conservation , the measurable field tensor @xmath8 which solves them is always coupled to a conserved charge",
    ".    the results can be relevant for applications to condensed - matter systems with coherent quantum tunnelling , or to more exotic situations in which the occurrence of a chiral anomaly or a spacetime singularity causes a tunnelling process between two vacuum states @xcite .",
    "the modified theory of aharonov - bohm has an additional degree of freedom , the scalar field @xmath9 , which can not be set to zero through a suitable choice of the gauge , as usually done in the standard theory .",
    "the field @xmath1 amounts to the presence , in wave solutions , of an anomalous longitudinal component . since , however , the source of @xmath1 is the quantity @xmath10 , in fact @xmath1 is decoupled from matter if charge is locally conserved everywhere .",
    "the authors of @xcite discuss the possibility that charge fluctuations generate fluctuations of @xmath1 , or that boundary condition at the interface between vacuum and some media may also affect @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite briefly mentions the possibility that the local conservation of charge is violated in macroscopic tunnelling phenomena .",
    "we shall comment on this latter point in our conclusions .    in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we show that working in the standard four - vector formalism it is possible to eliminate completely the field @xmath1 from the field equations , and so obtain generalized , self - consistent maxwell equations with very interesting properties , namely : ( a ) they allow to compute @xmath11 starting from any physical source @xmath12 , either locally conserved or not ; ( b ) if @xmath13 , the equations reduce to maxwell equations ; ( c ) if @xmath14 , the equations give an additional current @xmath4 such that @xmath15 is conserved and equal to @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that any anomalous local non - conservation of the source @xmath12 is automatically `` censored '' by the field that it generates , because when we observe the source by measuring @xmath11 with test particles we can only see the conserved current @xmath15 . in spite of the censorship ,",
    "if the physical current @xmath12 is not locally conserved , the consequences are real , because the @xmath11 field will contain a non - maxwellian component whose features will be analysed , in two simple cases , in sect .  [ sec3 ] .",
    "[ disc ] contains our conclusions and a brief discussion of possible applications to josephson tunnelling in high - t@xmath17 superconductors .",
    "the maxwell equations in heaviside units are written in covariant form as @xcite @xmath18 note that since @xmath19 is antisymmetric , the field equation for @xmath19 can only be solved if @xmath20 .",
    "this field equation can be derived from the lagrangian @xmath21\\ ] ]    @xmath22 is seen as a function of the fundamental dynamical variable @xmath23 and is the most general possible relativistic invariant lagrangian constructed with a four - vector field .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath24 can be written as a four - divergence and therefore gives in fact no contribution to the action @xmath25 . when @xmath26 one speaks of the `` minimal '' lagrangian .",
    "in a gauge transformation @xmath27 the variation of @xmath22 is @xmath28 if the current is conserved , this is equivalent to @xmath29 and therefore @xmath22 is gauge - invariant up to a four - divergence .",
    "aharonov and bohm proposed to add a term @xmath30 to the minimal @xmath22 .",
    "the new addition , not being a four - divergence , changes the field equations , as follows : @xmath31 under a gauge transformation , the variation of the aharonov - bohm lagrangian is @xmath32\\ ] ] thus the lagrangian is not gauge - invariant anymore .",
    "it is only invariant ( if @xmath33 ) under reduced gauge transformations , such that @xmath34 .    in the aharonov - bohm theory",
    "we can not impose the familiar lorenz gauge , choosing a new four - potential @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we must regard the quantity @xmath37 as a non - trivial dynamical variable .",
    "now take the derivative @xmath38 of the field eq .",
    "( [ field1 ] ) and remember that @xmath39 is antisymmetric",
    ". we obtain @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the dalembert operator @xmath42 . from ( [ field2 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath43 the well - known operator @xmath44 is linear and non - local , as can be seen passing to four - momentum space , where it is represented by @xmath45 .",
    "( [ field3 ] ) allows us to write an expression for the variable @xmath1 , essentially integrating over the `` source '' @xmath46 : @xmath47    now go back to ( [ field2 ] ) , rename the summation index ( @xmath48 ) , take again the derivative @xmath49 and multiply by @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 plug this into ( [ field1 ] ) and re - write the inhomogeneous generalized maxwell equations as follows ( the homogeneous equations remain the same ) :    * version 1 * : equations for the field strength @xmath51 , the most simple and useful : @xmath52    * version 2 * : equations for the four - potential @xmath53 , formally more complex : @xmath54    note that eq .",
    "( [ mme2]-c ) is technically an awkward gauge condition , `` obtainable '' with the residual gauge freedom .",
    "a quantum field theory of the four - potential in this gauge looks difficult !",
    "yet we believe the classical field equations of version 1 are interesting enough .",
    "note that although these are derived from the aharonov - bohm lagrangian @xmath55 , the parameter @xmath7 has disappeared .",
    "if the current @xmath56 is conserved , then the usual maxwell equations are recovered . the new current component @xmath57 which now contributes , together with @xmath58 , to generate the field @xmath39 , is such that the total current @xmath59 is always conserved , as can be checked in two ways : ( 1 ) by taking the derivative @xmath38 in the first equation of ( [ mme1 ] ) ; ( 2 ) by taking the derivative @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) , which yields consistently @xmath60    summarizing , we can say that the input of the generalized electrodynamic equations ( [ mme1 ] ) is a four - current @xmath58 which is not necessarily conserved ( computed , for instance , from an `` anomalous '' microscopic model , as discussed in the following ) ; but the output is an electromagnetic field tensor @xmath39 which has the usual properties , including that of being generated by a conserved current , namely @xmath59 .",
    "it follows the important property that at the macroscopic level the current is always conserved , as far as it is possible to measure it through the field it generates . since eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-a ) is linear , the field @xmath39 is the sum of the fields generated by the currents @xmath58 and @xmath57 . in general , the difference between the two currents is that even if the `` primary '' current @xmath3 is confined in a certain region of spacetime , the `` secundary '' current @xmath57 is not , because of the non - local expression which relates it to @xmath58 .",
    "a further discussion of this point is given in sect .",
    "let us find the solutions of the generalized maxwell equations ( [ mme1 ] ) for a simple planar source in stationary flow regime @xmath61 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume that inside the source the three - divergence @xmath62 is not zero , i.e. , charge is being emitted ( possibly by tunnelling from another region where it is absorbed ; compare fig .  2 ) .",
    "the source is a thin layer of thickness @xmath63 on the @xmath64-@xmath65 plane .",
    "suppose that inside the layer we have @xmath66 ( fig .  1 , ( a ) ) . the current density @xmath67 will generate , according to eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-a ) , a magnetostatic field in the space region with @xmath68 .",
    "there will also be , however , an additional magnetostatic field generated by the secondary current @xmath69 .     for a plane which emits a stationary flow of charge , thus violating the continuity condition @xmath70 . the secondary current density ( eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) ) is @xmath71 ( + for @xmath72 ,  for @xmath68 ) , so the violation is censored by the total current @xmath73 .",

    "let us compute @xmath69 .",
    "start from eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) and rewrite it as @xmath74 . in this case @xmath75 does not depend on time .",
    "then @xmath76 and for the spatial component @xmath77",
    "we can write @xmath78    but @xmath79 is , in heaviside units , like @xmath80 the electric potential of a charge distribution with density @xmath75 ; and @xmath81 is like the electric field of this distribution . these are mathematical properties familiar from the maxwell equations , which we may apply here , although in a different context .",
    "the source of this `` equivalent electric field '' , which coincides mathematically with the secondary current @xmath69 , is a planar charge distribution with surface density @xmath82    therefore the secondary current density @xmath69 enters into the @xmath64-@xmath65 plane both from the right and the left ( like the electric field of a negatively charged plane ) :",
    "@xmath83    it follows that the total current density is continuum : @xmath84 the emission of charge from the plane is censored , since an observer who can only measure the electromagnetic field will see a continuum flux of charge going from @xmath85 to @xmath86 . for the case of a double plane ,",
    ".  2 .    , which amounts to `` four units '' everywhere .",
    "@xmath87 : physical , or `` primary '' , current density .",
    "@xmath88 : secondary current density emitted by plane 1 according to eq .",

    "@xmath89 : secondary current density emitted by plane 2.,width=377,height=264 ]    next consider a stationary dipolar source made of a pointlike charge emitter placed near a pointlike absorber , i.e.@xmath90\\ ] ] let us just compute the secondary current , in order to check that it is not localized : @xmath91 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu { \\partial ^k}\\left ( { \\frac{1}{{\\left| { { \\bf{x } } - { \\bf{a } } } \\right| } } - \\frac{1}{{\\left| { { \\bf{x } } + { \\bf{a } } } \\right| } } } \\right ) \\label{i - dip}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath77 is like the electric field of a dipole . the magnetostatic field that it generates can be computed from ( [ mme1]-a ) , for instance through the biot - savart formula .",
    "we have seen that the generalized aharonov - bohm electrodynamics , here re - formulated and solved for the scalar field @xmath1 , is applicable also to situations where charge is not locally conserved . in these situations",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath8 hides the non - conservation , because its source contains also an additional , `` secondary '' current term which compensates for the non - conserved part of the physical current .",
    "this mechanism is particularly clear in the example of the double plane with tunnelling ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "one might thus have the feeling that in the end the theory is not telling us anything new , compared to maxwell theory .",
    "this is not the case , however , since the field generated by the secondary current @xmath4 is not maxwellian , as a consequence of the non - local character of @xmath4 .",
    "such non - locality descends in general from eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) and is clearly seen in the example of the static dipole , eq .",
    "( [ i - dip ] ) .",
    "( an oscillating dipole solution will be presented in a separate paper . )",
    "what do we mean exactly by `` non - maxwellian '' field ?",
    "given any antisymmetric tensor @xmath5 , according to ( [ mme1]-a ) the derivative @xmath2 yields a conserved source @xmath15 which generates it .",
    "if we substitute this entire source into the maxwell equations and regard it as a physical source , then we obtain the same @xmath5 as a solution of the maxwell equations , and so by definition `` maxwellian '' .",
    "it may happen , however , that @xmath15 is manifestly not physical , for instance because it extends to spatial infinity while the material systems we are considering are limited in space . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath5 is not maxwellian .",
    "more specifically , we may wonder if there exists a solution @xmath92 which represents a wave in vacuum ( @xmath93 ) with a longitudinal component . from ( [ mme1]-a )",
    "we obtain @xmath4 : @xmath94 .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) relates @xmath4 to the physical current density @xmath3 .",
    "the question then becomes : does a suitable physical current @xmath3 exist , located inside a bounded region , able to generate in the vacuum space near it a current @xmath95 ?",
    "a detailed answer to this question will require to analyse the invertibility of eq .",
    "( [ mme1]-b ) .",
    "the answer might be affirmative thanks to the non - locality of the operator @xmath96 .",
    "compare also the functional approach in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the possible concrete existence of physical currents which are not locally conserved .",
    "the abj anomalies represent , as mentioned , such a possibility .",
    "we recall that abj anomalies have also been observed in condensed matter @xcite , but as anomalies in momentum space , and therefore probably not relevant to our case .",
    "the possible non - conservation of current in macroscopic quantum tunnelling is discussed in @xcite , with reference to josephson junctions in high - t@xmath17 superconductors . in short ,",
    "it is conjectured that due to the very small correlation length @xmath97 , the stationary continuity condition @xmath98 may be violated in wide inter - grain junctions where @xmath99 decreases by many magnitude orders @xcite while @xmath100 can not increase in inverse proportion .",
    "it is known that the solutions of the ginzburg - landau equation satisfy a continuity condition for the current .",
    "the ginzburg - landau equation , however , should be only regarded as a phenomenological local approximation .",
    "the microscopic theory of high - t@xmath17 superconductors is still unsettled . in complex condensed matter systems ,",
    "macroscopic wave functions of charge carriers obey a constrained equation and have therefore in general a non - local conserved current @xcite .",
    "this might be related to the puzzle of the superluminal tunnelling times @xcite .    in conclusion , it can not be ruled out that in certain situations the macroscopic tunnelling of the wave function is associated to non - local conservation of the current , thus requiring the generalized aharonov - bohm theory , and possibly generating non - maxwellian fields in the sense discussed above .    furthermore , the possible existence of non - conserved currents associated to tunnelling processes is obviously relevant also for other interactions , besides the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "one can consider , for instance , non - conserved hadronic currents .",
    "the generalized electrodynamics presented in this paper can be applied to such currents and tells us that they could be partially concealed from electromagnetic measurements , but still be real .",
