    "the transition pathways by which proteins interconvert between these folded states are largely unknown because intermediates along the pathways can not be directly characterized by experiments .",
    "similarly , it remains poorly understood how perturbations due to effector binding are communicated across the protein to alter its conformational free energy landscape . in this article",
    "we combine long unbiased all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , an efficient pathway sampling algorithm called the string method @xcite , and analysis of inter - residue correlations to characterize a protein conformational transition pathway and how it is affected by effector binding .",
    "in particular , we study the conformational transition of the ms2 coat protein dimer , and how the binding of an rna stem loop from the ms2 genome acts as a molecular conformational switch that guides protein assembly into an icosahedrally symmetric capsid .",

    "180 copies of the coat protein ( cp ) spontaneously assemble around a 3,569 nucleotide single - stranded rna genome to form an icosahedral capsid .",
    "the capsid is a @xmath0 structure , meaning that the cps adopt three conformations ( termed a , b , c ) which are precisely arranged within the capsid @xcite .",
    "major structural differences among the protein conformations are confined to the fg loop , which in the a and c conformations forms an anti - parallel @xmath1-hairpin , but in the b conformation is a flexible loop pulled back against the dimer with a small @xmath2-helix kink .",

    "the monomers form stable , non - covalent dimers , which are the basic assembly subunits and will be denoted as @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ms2 ] b , c ) .",
    "formation of the capsid thus requires that 30 cc and 60 ab dimers associate and arrange themselves into the icosahedral geometry ( fig .",

    "experiments by stockley and coworkers @xcite on wild - type cp showed that , in the absence of genomic rna , cp assembles slowly and produces only a low yield of capsids . adding a molar ratio of tr results in a strongly bonded @xmath3:tr complex that is kinetically trapped . however , adding an equal molar ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath3:tr results in rapid and efficient assembly . furthermore , nmr studies on an assembly - incompetent mutant ms2 coat protein ( trp82arg ) , showed that tr binding induces a conformation change from a symmetric dimer ( presumably bb - like ) to an asymmetric dimer ( presumably ab - like ) .",
    "based on these observations , it was proposed that during assembly of wild - type ( wt ) ms2 capsid proteins , tr binding acts as a molecular switch which favors a conformational change from the symmetric cc dimer to the asymmetric ab dimer @xcite . since both ab and",
    "cc dimers are needed for efficient assembly , this scenario is consistent with the observation that pure solutions of either @xmath3 ( assumed to be cc ) or @xmath3:tr ( assumed to be ab : tr ) are kinetically trapped whereas an equal molar ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath3:tr results in rapid and efficient assembly .",

    "namely , fluctuations of residues near the fg loop on the a@xmath4 chain ( meaning the chain that corresponds to the a chain in the ab dimer conformation ) are suppressed , whereas those near the b@xmath4 fg loop increase .",
    "the goal of this paper is to directly calculate the ms2 capsid protein conformational free energy landscape , to learn how it is altered by the binding of the genome fragment tr , and to elucidate the molecular basis by which perturbations caused by tr binding are communicated across the protein . to this end",

    "furthermore , to directly probe the molecular basis for allosteric communication , we characterize correlations of amino acid conformational statistics and motions within long , unbiased md simulation trajectories .",
    "these combined calculations demonstrate that the conformational transition is a complex , multi - step process with multiple metastable minima , and is stabilized by multiple molecular - scale interactions whose statistics can be altered by molecular binding in disparate regions of the protein .",
    "the analysis predicts several amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition rates . these findings may shed light on the mechanisms by which molecular binding affects conformational free energy landscapes in a wide variety of proteins , as well as for understanding the diverse roles of rna in viral assembly",

    "while a number of powerful methods have been developed to sample transition pathways and other rare events ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the string method provides a means to discover the mftp in a space of many collective variables ( cvs ) , with a computational expenditure that is nearly independent of the number of cvs . to obtain a meaningful free energy minimum",
    ", the collective variables must include all slow degrees of freedom relevant to the transition .",
    "our collective variables were chosen to be a subset of the atomic positions @xcite .",
    "the method can be summarized as follows .",
    "a set of collective variables capable of characterizing all relevant slow degrees of freedom in the system is chosen ( section  [ subsubsec : selecting_cvs ] ) .",
    "an initial pathway connecting the two stable states is discretized as an ordered sequence of states ( called images ) and represented as a curve ( called a string ) in the multidimensional collective variable space . an iterative calculation",
    "is then performed to relax the initial pathway toward a minimum free energy pathway : ( 1 ) for each image , multiple short md simulations are performed in which sampling is constrained to the vicinity of that image in collective variable space by a harmonic bias potential .",
    "the gradient of the free energy in collective variable space at each image is calculated from the average force imposed by the bias potential .",

    "( 3 ) images are redistributed to maintain uniform spacing in arc length along the string .",
    "steps ( 1 - 3 ) are repeated until the string converges to within desired precision . the free energy profile along the converged string",
    "can then be calculated using umbrella sampling ( section  [ subsec : string_free_energy ] ) .",
    "details about these procedures , the chosen set of coordinates , and assessments of convergence are given in appendix  [ appendix : string ] .",
    "a string is defined by a set of collective variables ( cvs ) , which must include all slow degrees of freedom that are relevant to the reaction .",
    "it is not known _ a priori _ which cvs constitute a good reaction coordinate . while in principle it is possible to choose a large number of cvs with the expectation that a subset of them will constitute a good reaction coordinate , extraneous or redundant cvs can introduce noise that slows convergence .",

    "based on extensive trial calculations using various types of cvs ( including distances , positions , and dihedral angles ) , we found cartesian positions of individual atoms to be best suited for the study of ms2 .",
    "atomic positions have been successfully used in previous studies @xcite and can capture both the native cc backbone hydrogen bonds breaking / forming and the formation of the @xmath2-kink in the ab state .    because absolute positions are not invariant under rigid body motions , we restricted translational and rotational diffusion by including position restraints on 10 c@xmath11 atoms in the top helices of each monomer in @xmath3 ( residues 105 - 109 ) .",

    "furthermore , the strings indicate that tr binding dramatically alters the interconversion pathway , changing the sequence of events and the nature and number of intermediate metastable states .",
    "given that tr binds more than a nanometer from the the residues which undergo the majority of conformational rearrangement ( the fg loop ) , our calculations provide direct evidence for allostery and begin to reveal its underlying mechanisms , albeit within the limitations of force field accuracy and finite sampling .",
    "the fundamental effect of tr - binding is to generate an inherently asymmetric dimer .",
    "the cc@xmath37ab transition requires a spontaneous fluctuation that breaks the cc symmetry and ` chooses ' which fg loop will interconvert to a b conformation .",

    "we characterized these asymmetries , and how they are transmitted across the protein , by analyzing collective motions and correlated conformational statistics of amino acids within long unbiased md trajectories of each stable substate .",
    "we found extensive asymmetries in both the dynamical fluctuations and correlations .",
    "the most significant effect of tr binding was found to be on the fg loop of the b * monomer when comparing the ab and ab : tr conformations .",

    "based on this and other evidence it has been inferred that the cc state is preferred in the absence of tr , and the ab state in the presence of tr .",
    "our results from the string method calculation and the associated free energy profile directly support this conclusion , and also reveal that the associated transition pathways differ in the presence of tr .    a study by dykeman et al@xcite performed an all - atom normal mode analysis to determine how the vibrational modes are modified by rna binding .",
    "they found that tr binding to a ( wt ) cc conformation causes asymmetric fluctuations of the ef loop ; fluctuations increase in a@xmath4 and decrease in b@xmath4 .",
    "the mutant trp82arg has an asymmetry in the de loop instead , which was proposed as a possible explanation for why it is assembly - incompetent .",
    "our msf calculations also find asymmetries upon tr binding in the ef loop . while there is little difference between the fg loop fluctuations in the cc and cc : tr systems , tr binding in the ab systems shows the fluctuations in the b * fg loop greatly decreased upon tr binding .",
    "* limitations of our calculations and outlook . *",
    "the relevance of the string method pathway and associated free energy profile depend on the extent to which the collective variables describe all relevant slow degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , recent computational studies have shown that conformational transitions can proceed by multiple , diverse pathways ( _ e.g._@xcite ) , while a single string calculation typically samples only one transition tube .",
    "we have assessed several metrics to determine whether our set of collective variables was sufficient and the extent of sampling within trajectory space : ( 1 ) convergence during string iterations was reasonably rapid . missing slow degrees of freedom can be expected to slow convergence since they relax on a slow time scale .",
    "( 2 ) the umbrella sampling calculations were performed in both directions along the pathway .",
    "a lack of significant hysteresis between these two directions is consistent with inclusion of all relevant degrees of freedom .",

    "further testing of the validity of these calculations could be achieved by comparing the results to those of an independent technique , such as markov state model ( msm ) calculations .",

    "<S> in this article we use all - atom simulations to elucidate the mechanisms underlying conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of the bacteriophage ms2 . </S>",
    "<S> assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that the capsid protein adopt different conformations at precise locations within the capsid . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop ( tr ) from the ms2 genome acts as an allosteric effector , guiding conformational switching of the coat protein during capsid assembly . </S>",
    "<S> since the principal conformational changes occur far from the tr binding site , it is important to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this allosteric communication . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we use all - atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling technique to sample the ms2 coat protein conformational transition , in the presence and absence of tr - binding . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations find that tr binding strongly alters the transition free energy profile , leading to a switch in the favored conformation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible for this shift . </S>",
    "<S> we then identify networks of amino acids with correlated motions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of tr binding span the protein . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition rates . </S>"
