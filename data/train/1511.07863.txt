    "the gauss word problem was proposed by k. f. gauss in the beginning of the xix century when he was studying certain class of words @xmath2 with the property that each letter of @xmath2 appeared exactly twice .",
    "he noted that if we label the crossings points of an oriented normal curve @xmath3 on the plane , then the word formed with the letters that we met when following @xmath3 has the same characteristics as gauss words . in @xmath4 , j. s. carter @xcite introduced the concept of _ signed gauss paragraphs _ to classify the stable geotopy class of immersed curves on orientable and compact surfaces .",
    "the construction of these signed paragraphs is similar to the one of gauss words , but carter considered , not only the number of components of the normal curve , but also the way in which the curve meets itself .",
    "the work of carter left a topological solution of the planarity problem for signed gauss paragraphs .",
    "he gave an algorithm to find , from a signed gauss paragraph @xmath2 , an oriented normal curve @xmath5 embedded in an minimum genus orientable surface @xmath6 , such that @xmath2 is the signed gauss paragraph of @xmath5 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath7 is a minimal realization of @xmath2 . in @xmath8 ,",
    "g. cairns and d. elton , see @xcite , continued the work of carter and they presented a combinatorial solution of a particular case , known as the _ signed gauss word problem_. here , signed gauss words mean signed gauss paragraphs with one component .    in order to solve the signed gauss word problem , g. cairns and d. elton constructed a generating set @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and they proved that all these curves are null - homologue if and only if , for each of them , there exist a alexander numbering .",
    "their proof is very elegant , but it is so cumbersome . here , we use intersection homology of curves on orientable surfaces , instead of alexander numbering , to determine when these curves are null - homologue , because we think that this way is more direct .",
    "the intersection homology , @xmath11 , of two homology classes @xmath12 and @xmath13 on an orientable and compact surface @xmath14 , is a very well known invariant of @xmath15 .",
    "this number @xmath11 has been defined as the number of intersections of any two representative transverse curves of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , naturally , depending on the way in which one of them intersects the other one .",
    "one of the most important property of this number is :    [ homolo ] if @xmath16 and the homology intersection between @xmath12 and any @xmath13 in @xmath15 is equal to zero , then @xmath12 is null - homologue .",
    "moreover , if moreover @xmath14 is connected and closed , and @xmath17 is a generating set of @xmath15 , then @xmath18 if and only if @xmath19 , for every @xmath20 .",
    "motivated by the previous theorem we give a brief study of homology intersection of oriented @xmath0-normal curves immersed in orientable and compact @xmath0-surfaces .",
    "after that , for a signed gauss paragraph @xmath2 we define a @xmath21-valency graph @xmath5 , with extra information on its vertices , and we use theory of embedded graphs to get a realization @xmath22 of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the union of triangles of the @xmath24-barycentric subdivision of @xmath14 that meet @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath25 is an infinite collection of realization of @xmath2 , such that the number of components of the boundary of any of these @xmath0-surfaces , @xmath26 , is equal to the number of carter s circles of @xmath2 as defined in @xcite .",
    "therefore , by gluing discs to the boundary of any @xmath26 we get a minimal realization @xmath27 of @xmath2 .",
    "if we have a generating set of @xmath1 , from the theorem [ homolo ] , we would obtain a solution of the signed gauss paragraph problem , but we only have a generating set of @xmath1 for the case when @xmath2 is a signed gauss words , see @xcite . from that , we define the _ join _ operation for signed gauss paragraphs @xmath2 to produce signed gauss words @xmath28 with the property that @xmath1 is isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
