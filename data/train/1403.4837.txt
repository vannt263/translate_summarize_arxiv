    "models with an extra u(1 ) are among the simplest and most natural extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they enjoy both the top  down and bottom  up motivation .",
    "in particular , additional u(1 ) s appear in many string constructions . from the low energy perspective , the coupling between an sm fermions @xmath5 and a massive gauge boson z@xmath0 @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 are some constants , represents one of the dimension-4 `` portals '' ( see e.g.  @xcite ) connecting the observable world to the sm  singlet sector .",
    "this is particularly important in the context of dark matter models @xcite .",
    "if dark matter is charged under the extra u(1 ) , the above coupling provides a dm annihilation channel into visible particles .",
    "as long as the z@xmath0 has a tev scale mass and the couplings are not too small , this framework fits the wimp  miracle paradigm @xcite .",
    "recent lhc @xcite and direct dm detection constraints @xcite , however , put significant pressure on this idea since no traces of a z@xmath0 were found in either direct collider searches or dm scattering on nuclei .    in this letter , we argue that these negative results may be due to the axial nature of the z@xmath0 and its stronger coupling to dark matter compared to @xmath8 above . in this case , which we call `` axial dark matter '' ( axdm ) , dm scattering on nuclei is spin  dependent and weakly constrained .",
    "the lhc has limited sensitivity to such a z@xmath0 due to the fact that it decays predominantly into dark matter , as in @xcite . to couple",
    "universally to sm fermions , which distinguishes the model from the leptophobic scenarios ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . ]",
    "we thus find that all of the constraints can be satisfied , which adds some credibility to the wimp paradigm .",
    "in what follows , we consider the possibility that z@xmath0 is purely axial , with the couplings @xmath9 here @xmath5 represents the standard model ( sm ) fermions , @xmath10 is a dirac fermion constituting dark matter and @xmath11 are the corresponding z@xmath0 couplings .",
    "this lagrangian represents an effective low energy interaction after heavy particles have been integrated out and the vector boson kinetic terms have been diagonalized .",
    "clearly , the microscopic theory can be made anomaly ",
    "free by assigning appropriate charges to fermions ( we do not exclude the possibility of having further heavy fermions coupled to z@xmath0 ) .    one may ask how natural it is to have a pure axial  vector interaction . in our opinion , this choice is quite natural given the fact that the photon interaction is purely vector and the axial case is just the other extreme . also , our considerations hold in the presence of a small vector component of z@xmath0 , which may be generated through kinetic mixing @xcite .    to make our model as simple as possible , we will focus on the case of a universal coupling of z@xmath0 to the sm fermions , @xmath8 .",
    "( this assumption can of course be easily relaxed by inserting the fermion  dependent charges . )",
    "we then find that cosmological and accelerator constraints require @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "one would be hesitant to attribute such a hierarchy to the difference in the observable and hidden charges .",
    "on the other hand , factors of this type can arise in the system of two u(1 ) s mixing with each other .",
    "consider the general lagrangian describing two massive abelian gauge bosons , @xmath15 where @xmath16 couples only to the dark sector with coupling @xmath17 , while @xmath18 couples only to the visible sector with coupling @xmath19 .",
    "the lighter mass eigenstate would be a mixture of @xmath16 and @xmath18 , which couples to both sectors .",
    "the hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) can then be recovered in various limits .",
    "for example , it can result from @xmath20 . for",
    "order one kinetic mixing , @xmath21 , the z@xmath0 is composed mostly of @xmath16 and @xmath22 another possibility is to attribute ( [ hierarchy ] ) to the hierarchy in the couplings , @xmath23 . for a small kinetic mixing @xmath24 and large mass",
    "mixing @xmath25 , the z@xmath0 is a mixture of @xmath16 and @xmath18 with @xmath26 note that for @xmath27 , the mixing is nearly maximal and the second mass eigenstate becomes heavy . in what follows",
    ", we will be agnostic as to the origin of the hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) and will treat the two couplings as free parameters .",
    "in this section , we provide a list of cosmological and accelerator constraints on the model . these set bounds on the two couplings @xmath28 and the z@xmath0 mass @xmath29 . in order to understand their qualitative behaviour and compatibility ,",
    "we provide simple analytic approximations for the observables .    * planck / wmap and dm annihilation . *",
    "suppose that dm is produced thermally , as in the traditional wimp scenario .",
    "the main dark matter annihilation mechanism is the @xmath30-channel annihilation into sm fermion pairs . although we will use the exact tree ",
    "level result in our numerical analysis , it is instructive to consider the heavy z@xmath0 , @xmath31 , and zero dm  velocity limit .",
    ", while for a heavier z@xmath0 velocity  dependent contributions are equally important .",
    "we choose the limit @xmath32 for transparency of our discussion , while using the full result in our numerical analysis . ] in this case , the cross section takes on a particularly simple form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of colors for quarks and 1 for leptons .",
    "we see that , for light final state fermions , the cross section is suppressed .",
    "the origin of the @xmath35 factor can be understood from ( conserved ) c - parity considerations .",
    "the c - parity of the initial state must be + 1 to match that of z@xmath0 . since for a fermion  antifermion pair",
    "it is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath30 being the angular momentum and spin quantum numbers , the @xmath30-wave initial state ( @xmath38 ) must then have @xmath39 . on the other hand , the helicities of the relativistic final state fermions",
    "add up to 1 .",
    "hence , a spin flip is required leading to the @xmath40 dependence .",
    "note however that , for heavy fermions like the top quark , this factor does not lead to significant suppression of the amplitude .",
    "suppose that dm is sufficiently heavy such that its pair annihilation into top quarks is allowed .",
    "then for @xmath41 , the canonical wimp annihilation cross section @xmath42 @xmath43s@xmath44 translates into @xmath45 one should keep in mind that this figure indicates the ballpark of the result and the velocity- as well as @xmath46dependent contributions affect @xmath47 , while the definitive answer is given by our numerical analysis .",
    "+   * direct dm detection .",
    "* tree level z@xmath0 exchange leads to spin  dependent dm scattering on nuclei , which is constrained by a number of experiments .",

    "taking @xmath54 cm@xmath4 as the benchmark bound on @xmath56 for @xmath57 gev @xcite , one finds @xmath58 this bound is satisfied automatically for thermally produced dark matter ( see eq .",
    "( [ annih ] ) ) .",
    "spin  independent dm scattering is generated at one loop with the corresponding amplitude being suppressed both by a loop factor and the quark masses required by a helicity flip .",
    "the resulting bound is weak @xcite .",
    "we note that similar conclusions apply to the dm ",
    "nucleon interaction mediated by a pseudoscalar as recently studied in @xcite .",
    "+   + * lep bounds . *",
    "dark matter with @xmath59 can not be produced on  shell at lep . however , there are still significant constraints on z@xmath0 due to the effective operators @xmath60 for various fermions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these operators are constrained by the precise measurements of the cross sections and angular distributions of the final state fermions . in the axial case ,",
    "the resulting bound is @xcite @xmath63 comparing this to eq .",
    "( [ annih ] ) , one finds that z@xmath0 couples much stronger to dm than it does to sm fermions , @xmath64 +   + * perturbativity .",
    "* as is clear from the above discussion , the dm  z@xmath0 coupling can become quite strong .",
    "then , our approximation is controllable only if @xmath65 we do not impose further constraints on the position of the landau pole of the coupling as we expect our model to be uv  completed already in the multi  tev range",
    ". +   + * dilepton and monojet lhc bounds .",
    "* at the lhc , both dark matter and z@xmath0 can be produced on  shell , which leads to strong bounds from cms and atlas .",
    "the most important constraint is due to searches for dileptons with a large invariant mass .",
    "we will use the cms z@xmath0 analysis of 3.6 fb@xmath44/8 tev and 5 fb@xmath44/7 tev @xcite as our benchmark constraint .",
    "the result is summarized in fig.2 ( upper right panel ) of that paper .",
    "for a sequential sm z@xmath0 ( ssm ) , that is having the same couplings as the standard model z - boson , the exclusion limit is around 2.5 tev . to adapt the results to our case",
    ", one must take into account the difference in the z@xmath0 couplings as well as the reduced branching ratio for z@xmath0 decay into visible fermions , @xmath66 for our estimates it suffices to approximate @xmath67 by its ( universal ) axial component , @xmath68 .",
    "the branching ratio for z@xmath0 decay into sm fermions is @xmath69 where @xmath70 accounts for the kinematic suppression in an axial ",
    "vector decay ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these factors result in the dependence of the number of expected @xmath71 events on @xmath8 and @xmath72 .",
    "the constraints on z@xmath0 relax significantly as @xmath8 decreases and @xmath73 as light as 500 gev becomes allowed given it decays predominantly invisibly .    to estimate the resulting lhc bound on @xmath73 , we analytically approximate the @xmath71 production cross section in fig.2 of @xcite and calculate how much it should be reduced to comply with its experimental bound .",
    "we find that the result can be cast in the form @xmath74 $ ] , for @xmath75 in tev and @xmath76 being an @xmath73range dependent constant : @xmath77 tev for @xmath78 tev .",
    "for instance , a 500 gev z@xmath0 becomes allowed if the @xmath71 cross section reduces by about 3 orders of magnitude , whereas a 2.5 tev z@xmath0 is allowed with no suppression required .",
    "z@xmath0 models are also constrained by monojet events with large missing energy , which is due to z@xmath0 decay into dark matter .",
    "the atlas analysis of 10.5 fb@xmath44/8 tev data @xcite imposes the bound on the axial  vector interaction ( d8operator of @xcite ) , @xmath79 for @xmath80 gev ( and a weaker bound for heavier dm ) .",
    "inclusion of on - shell effects does not make the constraint significantly stronger @xcite . as a result , similarly to the direct dm detection constraint , it is satisfied when eq .",
    "( [ annih ] ) is imposed . +   + * combined constraints . *",
    "the above estimates serve to single out the most important constraints , whose compatibility is to be analyzed .",
    "we see that , once the correct dm relic abundance is imposed , the main factors restricting available parameter space are the lhc dilepton bound and perturbativity . indeed , the lhc constraint can always be satisfied by decreasing @xmath8 , which according to eq .",
    "( [ annih ] ) increases @xmath81 until it hits the perturbative bound ( [ pert ] ) .",
    "we find that all of the constraints are in fact compatible .",
    "for instance , at @xmath82 gev , the allowed range of @xmath83 spans about two orders of magnitude , from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "to go further , let us remind the reader that our estimate of the dm relic abundance constraint ( [ annih ] ) is rather simplistic .",
    "it does not take into account resonant effects nor those due to thermal averaging .",
    "the correct treatment is provided by the numerical package micromegas @xcite . using this tool , we find the same qualitative conclusion : all of the constraints are compatible . in our numerical study",
    ", we impose the condition is very small and the z@xmath0 production cross section is suppressed altogether . ]",
    "@xmath84 which allows for the z@xmath0 decay into dark matter and amounts to `` invisibility '' of the former .",
    "two representative results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the left panel , we set @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 and scan parameter space @xmath87 satisfying the planck constraint @xcite .",
    "as @xmath73 increases from @xmath88 , so does @xmath81 . in this region ,",
    "the effect of resonant annihilation is important .",
    "the resonance is quite broad , on the order of tens of gev , due to the thermal smearing .",
    "away from the resonance , @xmath81 quickly turns non  perturbative .",
    "the lhc constraint excludes part of the parameter space close to the threshold , where the invisible z@xmath0 decay is inefficient .",
    "further constraints from lep , direct dm detection and monojets are satisfied automatically in this panel .",
    "the result is that the @xmath73 range 520 - 560 gev is allowed , while @xmath81 varies by two orders of magnitude , from 0.05 to 5 .",
    "for heavier dm , the lhc bound becomes less severe and the coupling @xmath8 is allowed to be larger . for example , in the right panel of fig .  1",
    ", the cms constraint is satisfied everywhere due to the suppressed z@xmath0 production with @xmath89 . the @xmath73 range satisfying planck extends over hundreds of gev .",
    "the pattern observed in this figure is quite general : the allowed parameter space is not far from the resonance region , @xmath90 , with the latter being relatively broad , @xmath91 .",
    "the lep , direct dm detection and monojet constraints are satisfied automatically in the region of interest , while the dilepton lhc bound cuts out part of the parameter space .",
    "the dark matter candidate , axdm , belongs to the general wimp category as it has a tev scale mass and couplings in the range @xmath92",
    ". a detailed scan of axdm parameter space is reserved for a subsequent publication .",
    "in this paper , we have explored a very simple scenario in which dark matter couples to the sm fermions via an axial z@xmath0 ( `` axial dark matter '' ) .",
    "the model is characterized by 2 couplings as well as the z@xmath0 and dm masses .",
    "if the z@xmath0 couples much stronger to the dark sector compared to the visible sector , which may be due to a mixing of two u(1 ) s , all the phenomenological constraints can be satisfied .",
    "in particular , the lhc constraints are loose due to invisible z@xmath0 decay and allow for @xmath73 as low as 500 gev , while dm scattering on nuclei is spin  dependent and thus weakly constrained .",
    "the correct dm relic density is obtained in regions not far from the resonance , @xmath90 .",
