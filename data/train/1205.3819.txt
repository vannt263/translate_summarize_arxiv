    "recent extensive reviews of their composition , structure and dynamics are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relation of a filament to surrounding magnetic structure is also complicated .",
    "viewed above the limb , a quiescent prominence will often be situated within , or at the base of , a large system of magnetic loops",
    ". observed in white light and in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) , a semicircular or circular region of closed loops surrounding the prominence is relatively dark compared to the surrounding corona , and is therefore labeled a coronal cavity @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that cavities are not depleted of density , but are at a very high temperature on the order of 2mk @xcite .",
    "the relation between the cavity and filament is still unclear .",
    "the general filament / cavity model is of an arcade of loops anchored at the photosphere with the filament constrained within the loop system .",
    "the arcade can be raised above the photosphere in the form of a helical flux rope @xcite .",
    "reports of long - lived rotation , or cyclonic , behaviour of non - eruptive prominences are sporadic but have been made for a long time .",
    "such phenomena are called ` tornadoes ' due to their appearance but their physics are of course very different to that of terrestrial tornadoes .",
    "@xcite describes in detail the behaviour of prominences and categorize some as ` tornado / spiral ' . @xcite",
    "measured lineshifts of h@xmath0 for filaments on the disk , and found a shift consistent with rotation of the filament at velocity @xmath210km@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite made a study of 51 prominences and found 5 which showed rotation , with apparent velocities of 15 - 75km@xmath3 , and interpreted the rotation in terms of a twisting of magnetic structure , and invoke reconnection as a way to explain the long - lived rotation .",
    "@xcite describe continuous rotational movement of filament cavities observed by the extremeultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) aboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "this movement is interpreted as a ` pinch - off ' of a system of arcade loops surrounding a filament , leading to a helical flux rope .",
    "flow of material along the original arcade is then restricted to rotate around the helix . in this letter",
    ", we report a unique activation of a quiescent prominence observed by sdo / aia @xcite .",
    "such prominences are known to produce emission at temperatures to about @xmath4 and show motions of up to 70 km s@xmath5 @xcite , and upward - moving jets may be a mechanism injecting mass into prominences @xcite .",
    "we describe the phenomenon in detail in section [ observations ] , and give further discussion and provide possible interpretations in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the aia instrument aboard sdo measures euv light in several narrow wavelength channels each of which is dominated by an emission line formed at a particular temperature @xcite .",
    "its high time ( @xmath212s ) and spatial ( 0.6 \" ) resolution provide a new view of the dynamics of chromospheric and coronal structures .",
    "the observations presented here are mostly of the 171  bandpass channel , dominated by emission of fe@xmath6 formed at @xmath20.7mk , and the 304  channel dominated by he@xmath7 emission at @xmath8k ( * ? ? ?",
    "the filament under study is at position angle 215@xmath9(counter - clockwise from north ) . seen in h@xmath0 in a daily sequence of big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) observations prior to the active phase under study , it is a nondescript filament , rather dim and ill - defined , forming part of a chain of similar filaments at the same latitude .",
    "almost two days of data are analysed from 2011/09/24 06:00 to 2011/09/26 00:00 , during which time the prominence becomes active , the tornado is formed , and disappears .",
    "[ 2dayevolution ] shows the development of the whole structure during this period .",
    "what is immediately apparent from this time sequence is the similarity of structure at 2011/09/24 18:00 and 2011/09/25 00:00 with other studies of filaments and their associated cavities , for example @xcite .",
    "the cavity is suspended above the limb , and the filament is based directly below the u - shape cradle forming the base of the cavity .",
    "the cavity is most clearly seen in the 193  and 211  channels as shown in fig .",
    "[ channels ] , which are dominated by emission lines at 1.5 and 1.8mk respectively .",
    "the cavity is difficult to see in the 171  channel , and is invisible in the 304  channel .",
    "apparent in fig .",
    "[ 2dayevolution ] are dark barbs , probably components of one of the filament legs , rooted at the base of the structure from the beginning of the observation period .",
    "this configuration is consistent with the type of model described by , for example , @xcite of a large system of loops or helix enclosing the tighter helix and cool gas of the filament itself .    from 2011/09/25 00:00",
    "onwards , the evolution of the structure is considerably different to that of @xcite where an eruption of the cavity and filament was observed . between 2011/09/25 02:30 - 03:10",
    "the whole structure experiences a large - scale and short - lived wobble initially towards the pole , and small blobs are seen to appear and disappear in the cavity immediately above the filament . accompanying",
    "this movement is a maelstrom of small - scale activity amongst dark fibrils at the filament base , extending upwards towards the base of the cavity . by 25/09/25 06:00 ( 5@xmath10panel of fig .",
    "[ 2dayevolution ] ) , the filament and cavity have developed a distinct tornado - like appearance , with a large circular structure atop a narrower pillar .    at @xmath28:00 , a significant movement of material from the main body of the filament into the cavity along a very fine channel ( the width is about 3 - 5 pixels ) is observed . by @xmath28:20 ,",
    "more flow channels appear and the flows seem to come from both sides of the prominence .",
    "these channels rise and fall back along curved trajectories , indicating the motions are along curved magnetic field lines .",
    "that the fine channels of flows can break into segments is possibly due to surface instabilities ( ryutova et al .",
    "the swirling motions of the channels around the prominence suggest the presence of helical magnetic fields , but it is difficult to see any helix clearly before 10:00 .",
    "these motions make the prominence appear 50,000 km higher than before @xmath28:00 . from @xmath210:00",
    ", there is a large new injection of material into the filament base from a narrow channel at one side of the filament .",
    "the upflow of this material towards the cavity base is obvious in the highest time resolution images ( see online animation ) .",
    "the origin of the flow can be traced to a location at least 14 - 18 mm above the solar limb .    following the upflow at 10:00 , and for the next @xmath23 hours",
    ", there is a spectacular series of movements at the head of the tornado , with streaks and blobs of varying brightness following circular paths counterclockwise around the top of the filament pillar - what was previously a dark cavity .",
    "[ rotation ] shows some still images of this action . to truly appreciate the beauty of this event",
    ", the online animation should be viewed .",
    "blobs of material flow into space which was previously dark , highlighting magnetic structures which are otherwise invisible . at",
    "first ( 10:00 ) material is seen moving along a thin channel and by 10:10 the thin channel is already widened and a helix - like structure with at least seven turns is very obvious .",
    "the sudden appearance of a similar tightly - wound helix is repeated again at about 11:00 , and a less tightly - wound helix is apparent at @xmath211:45 .",
    "the very core of the tornado head is bright and complex , with strange slow rotation and movements of filamentary structure .",
    "a bright helix can be identified in the mid - left part of the structure at 11:45 while the right part shows more tightly wound structure . at about 12:00 , a tangled helix or",
    "a group of helices at the core of the tornado head evolves in a very complicated manner .",
    "the line of sight ( los ) integration , and the complexity of the structure , prevents any certainty in interpreting this evolution . if there are two or more helical structures we would expect some interaction - reconnection possibly , and the development of kink instabilities which may lead to entanglement of helices ( sakurai , 1976 ) .",
    "an event , possibly reconnection , is labelled ` v ' in fig . [ rotation ] .",
    "the apparent downflows at 12:30 ( labelled ` e ' ) appear to originate from the region where the bright v - shaped loop system and the loop next to it are seen to come into contact at @xmath2 12:00 ( see fig .",
    "[ rotation ] ) . of course",
    ", the contact could also be a projection effect .    by 18:00",
    "the head of the tornado has dimmed , the rotational movement has stopped and by 2011/09/26 00:00 the tornado has disappeared , leaving wispy strands extending at obtuse angles relative to the radial into the region previously occupied by the filament pillar .",
    "the main period of coherent rotation lasts for approximately 3 hours .",
    "a local correlation tracking ( lct ) method @xcite is adopted to compute the velocity field in the plane of the sky by using two images separated by 24 seconds .",
    "two panels in fig .",
    "[ velocity ] show the velocity map at 10:09 and 12:30 with corresponding maximum speed 55km / s and 95km / s , respectively .",
    "clear parallel arcs are seen in the higher part of the structure at 10:09 .",
    "these striated patterns suggest a helical flux tube , and the direction of movement shows that the helix is expanding upwards .",
    "the flow gains speed substantially , even when it ascends against gravity , suggesting that magnetic tension forces play an important role .",
    "another possible interpretation of the striations is of density waves moving along a pre - existing helical structure . for the coherent striated patterns to be apparent ,",
    "the density wave must have a wavelength close to that of the circumference of the helix windings .",
    "a detailed model study is needed to gain further understanding of this phenomenon . on top of the upward expansion of the helical structure ,",
    "the rotational motion of some blobs at the top of the structure at 12:30 looks circular , and is possibly due to material flowing along helical flux tubes .",
    "as we observe along the axis of the helix , the apparent motion is rotational . working from approximate estimates of the radius of the circular motion ( about 35000 km for a blob of material at x=60 , y=40 ) , and the time for a brightness enhancement to make a complete revolution ( about 3400s ) ,",
    "the true velocity is close to 65km@xmath3 .",
    "this is smaller than the sound speed .",
    "[ channels ] shows the appearance of the tornado in four aia channels .",
    "it is not possible to assign a temperature for this structure directly since the material flowing within the structure contains ions at a large range of formation temperatures . throughout the whole period of tornado formation and rotation ,",
    "the emission in the 304channel ( which is dominated by emission from he@xmath7 ) is almost identical to that of the hotter 171  channel .",
    "although the 304  channel can include emission from a hot line , the strength of the signal suggests that the material injected into the filament and cavity contains both hot and cold material . the existence of cold material is also supported by the presence of h@xmath0  in the tornado structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ halpha ] .",
    "the behavior in h@xmath0  is somewhat different , although the time coverage offered by ground - based telescopes is restricted .",
    "[ halpha ] shows that the tornado is emitting in h@xmath0 but by 15:30 ( last panel ) the emission comes from the very base of the structure .",
    "this is different to the behavior in 304  emission measured by aia , where the whole structure , including cavity , is bright past 15:30 .",
    "it is possible therefore that either the h becomes ionized after a few hours in the top of the structure .",
    "another factor is the sensitivity of the ground - based observations .",
    "certainly the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) observations ( rightmost panel ) are affected by cloud later in the day .",
    "at the start of the event narrow helical structures are upwelling into the cavity .",
    "the exact source of these helices is unclear , although it is likely that some or all of the underlying prominence is expanding upwards into the cavity possibly due to some disturbance at the prominence base .",
    "alternatively , when a helical flux tube is tightly wound , it may be unable to maintain stability @xcite and may eventually expand , upwell or untwist into the surrounding cavity without outside influence @xcite . following this initial development ,",
    "the complex appearance and evolution of the tornado can be interpreted as a combination of several different actions : 1 .",
    "the core of the tornado is formed of highly twisted magnetic fields which are unstable and interact with the surrounding cavity , possibly through reconnection .",
    "this interaction can result in sporadic localized brightenings and flows along the fields .",
    "2 . material flows upwards from the prominence base and some of this material ends up flowing along the helical fields of the prominence and/or cavity .",
    "this movement appears as a rotation when viewed along the helix axis .",
    "3 . density waves may propagate along the helical fields .",
    "4 . there are larger - scale structural evolutions ( for example , slow or rapid expansion of helices , general large - scale movements )    the filament probably consists of a highly tangled field @xcite , and flow within this filament will appear very complicated when the total emission is integrated over the los . such embedded and kinked helices will necessarily produce favorable conditions for magnetic reconnections to occur @xcite , although high twist and reconnection do not always lead to ejective behavior @xcite .",
    "reconnections may be difficult to observe in such a complex structure .",
    "the apparent downflows at 12:30 seem to originate from a region where two loop systems are seen to come into contact at @xmath2 12:00 ( see fig .",
    "[ rotation ] ) .",
    "@xcite studied rotation in coronal cavities and invoked a flow of material along an arcade of loops prior to the loops becoming detached from the solar surface and forming a helix .",
    "their description does not seem consistent with this event , where more sporadic injections of material , and more rapid magnetic structure evolution , are observed .",
    "although occasionally the top part of the prominence looks detached from the lower part ( fig .",
    "[ halpha ] at 11:09 ) , there is a continuous flow between the two parts and the upper part is not physically detached from the lower part of the prominence .",
    "whether there is a preference for equatorward rotation in such tornado - like events , as suggested by @xcite , is a matter for further observational study .",
    "if there is such a trend , there must be a preferential direction to filament / cavity helicity and a preferential direction for material flow along the structure .",
    "although the flow originates from a channel 14 - 18 mm above the solar limb with its width @xmath11 mm , circular motions as wide as 90 mm are observed at about 1.2@xmath12 , not much smaller than the diameter of the cavity ( roughly 110 - 130 mm from images of 193 ) .",
    "observations of the large circular motions and flows originating from a narrow channel may shed some light to the question why a cavity exists above a prominence .",
    "if most of the magnetic field flux in the cavity is rooted in a small region in the lower atmosphere , the small region may be simply unable to supply sufficient material into the cavity unless a dramatic injection of material is caused by some catastrophic event at the prominence base .",
    "the general ( quiescent ) case would therefore be of a dark cavity devoid of plasma due to the restrictive geometry of the flux tube at low heights .",
    "the dynamics and shape of this prominence and cavity are significantly more complex than those of the erupting prominence reported by kurokawa et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , rotational spicules reported by pike & mason ( 1998 ) , helical ` euv sprays ' reported by harrison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the emerging helical prominence reported by okamoto et al .",
    "the prominence is several times higher than the emerging cool column reported by okamoto et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the flow is also a few times faster and the rotation is more coherent .",
    "the fact that the prominence reported in this paper contains plasmas at both cool ( 10@xmath13 k ) and hot coronal temperatures while the emerging prominence reported by okamoto et a. ( 2010 ) is quite cool ( at @xmath14k ) suggests that the mechanisms which drive the flows in the two events may be different .",
    "recently , berger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discovered coronal - temperature plasma bubbles being injected into coronal cavities from below .",
    "although the bubbles are small compared to cavities , they argue that the discovery offers an explanation for the 8 - 10 km s@xmath5 flows observed by doppler velocity measurements in cavities @xcite .",
    "such quiescent prominence convection is a more gradual and consistent process than the dynamical event described here , although it is possible that the gradual build - up of plasma , magnetic flux and helicity to the cavity contributed to destabilization .",
    "this huge tornado - like structure is complex and is a compelling case for further study .",
    "similar dynamic events associated with a prominence and cavity are usually expected to erupt as a coronal mass ejection .",
    "this structure does not erupt , and remains dynamically coherent for several hours .",
    "it is therefore an interesting event which may shed light on the relationship between prominences and cavities , evolution of helical fields in the low corona , movement of material within cavities , limits on magnetic structural stability prior to eruption , and the general structural characteristics of cavities .",
