    "determining the nature of the host galaxies of powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is of importance not only for improving our understanding of different manifestations of agn activity , but also for exploring possible relationships between nuclear activity and the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "the recent affirmation that black - hole mass appears approximately proportional to spheroid mass in nearby inactive glaxies ( maggorian et al .",
    "1998 ) has further strengthened the motivation for exploring the link between active agn and the dynamical and spectral properties of their hosts .    over the last few years , improvements in imaging resolution offered by both space - based and ground - based optical / infrared telescopes has stimulated a great deal of research activity aimed at determining the basic structural parameters ( _ i.e. _ luminosity , size and morphological type ) of the hosts of radio - loud quasars , radio - quiet quasars , and lower - luminosity x - ray - selected and optically - selected agn ( _ e.g. _ disney et al .",
    "1995 ; hutchings & morris 1995 ; bahcall et al . 1997 ; hooper et al . 1997",
    "; mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "schade et al .",
    "however , relatively little corresponding effort has been invested in spectroscopic investigations of agn hosts , despite the fact that this offers an independent way of classifying these galaxies , as well as a means of estimating the age of their stellar populations .    our own work in this field to date",
    "has focussed on the investigation of the hosts of matched samples of radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and radio galaxies ( rgs ) at relatively modest redshift ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "details of these samples can be found in dunlop et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in brief ,",
    "the sub - samples of quasars ( i.e. rqqs and rlqs ) have been selected to be indistinguishable in terms of their two - dimensional distribution on the @xmath5 plane , while the sub - samples of radio - loud agn ( i.e. rlqs and rgs ) have been selected to be indistinguishable in terms of their two - dimensional distribution on the @xmath6 plane ( as well as having indistinguishable spectral - index distributions ) .",
    "deep infrared imaging of these samples ( dunlop et al . 1993 ; taylor et al . 1996 ) has recently been complemented by deep wfpc2 hst optical imaging ( mclure et al .",
    "1999 ) , the final results of which are reported by dunlop et al .",
    "as well as demonstrating that , dynamically , the hosts of all three types of luminous agn appear indistinguishable from normal ellipticals , this work has enabled us to deduce crude spectral information on the host galaxies in the form of optical - infrared colours .",
    "however , broad - baseline colour information can clearly be most powerfully exploited if combined with detailed optical spectroscopy . over the past few years",
    "we have therefore attempted to complement our imaging studies with a programme of deep optical off - nuclear spectroscopy of this same sample of agn .",
    "details of the observed samples , spectroscopic observations , and the basic properties of the observed off - nuclear spectra are given in a companion paper ( hughes et al . 2000 ) .",
    "as discussed by hughes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the key feature of this study ( other than its size , depth , and sample control ) is that we have endeavoured to obtain spectra from positions further off - nucleus ( @xmath7 arcsec ) than previous workers , in an attempt to better minimize the need for accurate subtraction of contaminating nuclear light .",
    "this approach was made possible by our deep infrared imaging data , which allowed us to select slit positions @xmath7 arcsec off - nucleus which still intercepted the brighter isophotes of the host galaxies ( slit positions are shown , superimposed on the infrared images , in hughes et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this paper we present the results of attempting to fit the resulting off - nuclear spectra with evolutionary synthesis models of galaxy evolution .",
    "our primary aim was to determine whether , in each host galaxy , the optical spectrum could be explained by the same model as the optical - infrared colour , and , if so , to derive an estimate of the age of the dynamically dominant stellar population .",
    "however , this study also offered the prospect of determining whether the hosts of different classes of agn differ in terms of their more recent star - formation activity .",
    "it is worth noting that our off - nuclear spectroscopy obviously does not enable us to say anything about the level of star - formation activity in the nucleus of a given host galaxy .",
    "rather , any derived estimates of the level of star - formation activity refer to the region probed by our observations @xmath7 arcsec off - nucleus .",
    "however , given the large scalelengths of the hosts , their relatively modest redshift , and the fact that our spectra are derived from long - slit observations , it is reasonable to regard our conclusions as applying to fairly typical regions , still located well within the bulk of the host galaxies under investigation .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide details of the adopted models , and how they have been fitted to the data .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , along with detailed notes on the fitting of individual spectra .",
    "the implications of the model fits are then discussed in section 4 , focussing on a comparison of the typical derived host - galaxy ages in the three agn subsamples .",
    "finally our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the detailed model fits , along with corresponding chi - squared plots are presented in appendix a.",
    "the stellar population synthesis models adopted for age - dating the agn host galaxy stellar populations are the solar metallicity , instantaneous starburst models of jimenez et al .",
    "we have endeavoured to fit each off - nuclear host galaxy optical spectrum by a combination of two single starburst components . for the first component",
    ", age is fitted as a free parameter , while for the second component the age is fixed at 0.1 gyr , and the normalization relative to the first component is the only free parameter .",
    "this dual - component approach was adopted because single - age models are not able to adequately represent the data , and because it allows the age of the dynamically dominant component to be determined in a way which is not overly reliant on the level of ultraviolet flux which might be contributed either by a recent burst of star - formation , or by contamination of the slit by scattered light from the quasar nucleus .",
    "after experimentation it was found that the spectral shape of the blue light was better represented by the 0.1 gyr - old ( solar metallicity ) model of jimenez than by models of greater ( intermediate ) age ( e.g. 1 gyr ) .",
    "moreover , the further addition of a third intermediate age component , @xmath8 1 gyr , did not significantly improve the quality of the fits achieved .    in general ,",
    "our data are of insufficient quality to tell whether the component which dominates at @xmath9  really is due to young stars , or is produced by direct or scattered quasar light . however , while the origin of the blue light is obviously of some interest , it has little impact on the main results presented in this paper , which refer to the age of the dynamically dominant stellar population which dominates the spectrum from longward of the 4000  break through to the near infrared .",
    "the robustness of the age determination of the dominant population is demonstrated by comparing the results of the two stellar - population model fit with the results of a fit allowi ng for a nuclear contribution as well as the two stellar populations .",
    "the model parameters determined were therefore the age of the dominant stellar population , which we can reasonably call the age of the galaxy , and the fraction , by ( visible ) baryonic mass , of the 0.1 gyr component . for the fit including a nuclear contribution ,",
    "the fraction of the total flux contributed by quasar light was a third parameter .",
    "the red end of each sed was further constrained by fitting @xmath10 colour simultaneously with the optical spectral energy distribution .",
    "the fitting process is described below .",
    "first , the observed off - nuclear spectra were corrected for redshift and transformed to the rest frame .",
    "they were then rebinned to the spectral resolution of the model spectra .",
    "the rebinned flux is then the mean flux per unit wavelength in the new bin and the statistical error on each new bin is the standard error in this mean .",
    "the data were normalised to a mean flux per unit wavelength of unity across the wavelength range 5020 @xmath11 5500 .",
    "the two - component model was built from the instantaneous - burst stellar - population synthesis model seds , so that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mean flux per unit wavelength in the bin centred on wavelength @xmath14 for a single burst model of @xmath15 gyr , @xmath16 is the fraction by mass of the young ( 0.1 gyr ) component , and @xmath17 is then the new , mean twin stellar - population flux per unit wavelength in the bin centred on wavelength @xmath14 for a model of @xmath15 gyr .",
    "this composite spectrum was then normalised in the same way as the observed spectra .",
    "a @xmath18  fit was used to determine the age of the older stellar population and the mass - fraction , @xmath16 , of the younger population , for each host galaxy in the sample .",
    "the whole parameter space was searched , with the best - fit values quoted being those parameter values at the point on the grid with the minimum calculated @xmath18 .",
    "the normalization of the model spectra was allowed to float during the fitting process , to allow the best - fitting continuum shape to be determined in an unbiased way .",
    "the models were fitted across the observed ( rest - frame ) spectral range , within the wavelength ranges listed in table 1 . as a result of the optimisation of the instruments with which the objects were observed , some of the galaxy spectra contain a ` splice ' region where the red and blue end of the spectrum have been observed separately and then joined together ( see hughes _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) for details ) .",
    "these splice regions , defined in table 1 , were masked out of the fit in order to guard against the fitting procedure being dominated by data - points whose flux calibration was potentially less robust .",
    "the main emission lines , present due to nuclear light contamination or nebular emission from within the host , were also masked out , over the wavelength ranges given in table 2 .",
    "the fit including a nuclear component was carried out in the same way , with the model flux in this case being @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fraction contributed to the total model flux by the nucleus , and @xmath21 is the observed flux of the nucleus of the radio quiet quasar 0054 + 144 .",
    "@xmath16 is the fraction by mass of the total stellar population contributed by the 0.1 gyr population .",
    "the wavelength range of the observed nuclear flux of 0054 + 144 is 3890@xmath116950 .",
    "this was extended to 3500@xmath118500  by smooth extrapolation over the wavelength ranges 3500@xmath113890  and 6950@xmath118500  in order to carry out the @xmath18  fit across the full wavelength range of the observed off - nuclear spectr a.    lccc    iau name & telescope & wavelength range / & masked splice region / +     +    0137 + 012 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + 0736 + 017 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6050@xmath116150 + 1004 + 130 & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6050@xmath116150 + 1020@xmath11103 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + 1217 + 023 & wht & 3500@xmath117500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 2135@xmath11147 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 2141 + 175 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 2247 + 140 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + & wht & 3500@xmath117500 & 6050@xmath116150 + 2349@xmath11014 & wht & 3500@xmath118300 & 6000@xmath116100 +     +    0054 + 144 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6000@xmath116100 + 0157 + 001 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6050@xmath116150 + 0204 + 292 & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6050@xmath116150 + 0244 + 194 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 0923 + 201 & wht & 3500@xmath117000 & + 1549 + 203 & wht & 3500@xmath118000 & 6050@xmath116150 + 1635 + 119 & wht & 3500@xmath117800 & 6000@xmath116100 + 2215@xmath11037 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 2344 + 184 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 +     +    0230@xmath11027 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 0345 + 337 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 0917 + 459 & wht & 3500@xmath118500 & 6050@xmath116150 + 1215@xmath11033 & wht & 3500@xmath117500 & 6000@xmath116100 + 1330 + 022 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & + 2141 + 279 & m4 m & 3890@xmath116950 & +    @xmath10 colour was fitted in both cases with a typical error of a few percent .",

    "+      the results illustrated in appendix a are summarised in table 3 .",
    "it should be noted that the 4000  break typical of evolved stellar populations is present in the majority of the observed spectra ( see appendix a and hughes _ et al . _  2000",
    ") , so we can be confident in fitting stellar population models to the data .",
    "the plots clearly show that the addition of even a very small amount of secondary star formation to the simple , near - instantaneous star - burst models reproduces the blue end of the observed host galaxy spectra much more successfully ( and in most cases very well ) than does a single stellar population .",
    "including a nuclear component further improves the fit to the blue end , especially for those spectra not well fit by purely stellar light . at the same time , the red end of the spectra , plus the observed @xmath10 colours generally require that the underlying stellar populations are old .",
    "the most meaningful output from the model fitting is a constraint on the minimum age of the host galaxies ; the @xmath18  plots show that often the best - fit age is not strongly constrained but the trend is clearly towards old ( @xmath41 8 gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "in general , young populations are strongly excluded .",
    "the peaks and troughs in @xmath18  as a function of model age appear to be the result of real features of the population evolution synthesis , rather than being due to , for example , poor sampling ( jimenez , private communication ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of best - fit ages estimated using jimenez models . the left - hand panel shows the ages of the dominant stellar component which result from fitting the two - component ( stars only ) model , while the right - hand panel shows the ages of the dominant stellar component in the case of the 3 component model ( i.e. two stellar components + a contribution from scattered nuclear light ) .",
    "the host galaxies of the agn in each sample are predominantly old , and this result is unaffected by whether or not one chooses to include some nuclear contribution to assist in fitting the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "this general result also appears to be relatively unaffected by the precise choice of stellar population model ; the models of bruzual and charlot ( 2000 ) , fitted to the host galaxies with the same process , reproduce the results for jimenez models to within a typical accuracy of 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "we have not attempted to fit the stellar population models of yi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , because of problems we have found in their ms rate of evolution ( nolan et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "inclusion of a nuclear contribution in the 3-component models obviously raises the question of whether a young stellar population component is really necessary at all .",
    "we thus also explored the results of fitting a two - component model consisting of a single stellar population plus nuclear contribution .",
    "such a model adequately reproduces the two - population - plus - nuclear - component results for the _ redder _ galaxies , but in fact the spectra of the bluest galaxies can not be adequately reproduced by these models ; the resulting serious increase in minimum @xmath18  demonstrates that inclusion of a young population component is necessary to achieve a statistically acceptable fit to these data .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of percentage contribution ( by mass ) , @xmath16 , of the young ( 0.1 gyr ) component to the spectra of the hosts .",
    "the left - hand panel shows the values of @xmath16 as derived from fitting the two - component ( stars only ) model , while the right - hand panel shows the values of @xmath16 produced by the 3 component model ( i.e. two stellar components + a contribution from scattered nuclear light ) .    where two spectra of the same object have been obtained with alternative telescopes / instruments , the derived ages of the dominant stellar componenets are reproduced reassuringly well .",
    "there are , however , small discrepancies in the estimated percentage of young population present ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this effect is suggestive that at least some of the blue light might be due to a scattered nuclear contribution , the strength of which would be highly dependent on the seeing at the time of observation , and on the precise repeatability of slit placement relative to the galaxy core .",
    "interestingly , when a nuclear component is included with the stellar flux model , an even smaller percentage of 0.1 gyr stellar population is required to fit the blue end of the spectra , and ( more importantly ) the difference in @xmath16 between two spectra of the same object is generally reduced .",
    "this provides further support for the suggestion that some of the bluest quasar host spectra remain contaminated by quasar light at the shortest wavelengths , and indicates that the right - hand panel of figure 2 provides a more realistic estimate of the level of on - going star - formation in the host galaxies . while this figure still appears to suggest that at least some quasar hosts display higher levels of ongoing star - fomration activity than do radio galaxies , statistically this ` result ' is not significant .",
    "there are three galaxies which have very low age estimates , namely 0230@xmath11027 , 0244 + 1944 and 1020@xmath11103 .",
    "these objects have the bluest observed @xmath10 colours , so it may be expected that the fitted ages would be younger than the rest of the sample , and that these populations are genuinely young . as discussed above , it may be that these objects are bluer because of scattered nuclear light contaminating the host galaxy spectrum",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that their fitted ages are low simply because of this , because elsewhere in our sample , where two spectra have been obtained of the same object , the amount of nuclear contamination present does not significantly affect the age estimation ( _ e.g. _ 0736 + 017 and 0157 + 001 ) .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of a nuclear component to the fit does not change the estimated age distribution of the host galaxies .",
    "if these ages are in error , then a more likely explanation , supported by the relative compactness of these particular host galaxies , is that nuclear and host contributions have been imperfectly separated in the @xmath42-band images , leading to an under - estimate of the near - infrared luminosity of the host .",
    "the result of the three - component fitting process which also allows a contribution from scattered nuclear light is that there are in fact only 3 host galaxies in the sample for which there is evidence that @xmath43 .",
    "one of these is the host of a radio - loud quasar ( 2135@xmath11147 ) but , as can be seen from fig a2 , this spectrum is one of the poorest ( along with 0230@xmath11027 , the only apparently young radio galaxy ) in the entire dataset .",
    "the 2 convincing cases are both the hosts of radio - quiet quasars , namely 0157@xmath44001 and 2344@xmath44184 .    within the somewhat larger sample of 13 rqqs imaged with the hst by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 4 objects showed evidence for a disk component in addition to a bulge , namely 0052 + 251 , 0157 + 001 , 0257 + 024 , and 2344 + 184 .",
    "since we do not possess spectra of 0052 + 251 and 0257 + 024 this means that there is a 1:1 correspondence between the objects which we have identified on the basis of this spectroscopic study as having recent star - formation activity , and those which would be highlighted on the basis of hst imaging as possessing a significant disk component .",
    "this straightforward match clearly provides us with considerable confidence that the spectral decomposition attempted here has been effective and robust .",
    "finally we note that it is almost certainly significant that 0157 + 001 , which has the largest starburst component ( @xmath45 ) based on this spectroscopic analysis , is also the only iras source in the sample .",
    "we conclude that the hosts of all three major classes of agn contain predominantly old stellar populations ( @xmath46 gyr ) by @xmath1 .",
    "this agrees well with the results of mclure _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) , and dunlop _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) who compare host galaxy morphologies , luminosities , scale lengths and colours in the same sample , and conclude that the hosts are , to first order , indistinguishable from ` normal ' quiescent giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the best - fitting age of the dominant stellar population is _ not _ a function of agn class . for the purely stellar models ,",
    "the fitted percentage contribution of the blue component is , however , greater in the quasar hosts than in the radio galaxies ; the median values are 0.6% for the 9 radio - loud quasars , 0.6% for the 9 radio - quiet quasars , and 0.05% for the 6 radio galaxies . however , when a nuclear component is included , the median values are 0.3% for the radio - loud quasars , 0.3% for the radio - quiet quasars , and 0.00% for the radio galaxies . performing a kolmogorov - smirnov test on these results",
    "yields a probability greater than 0.2 that the percentage of young stellar population in host galaxies is in fact also not a function of agn class .",
    "these results strongly support the conclusion that the host galaxies of all three major classes of agn are massive ellipticals , dominated by old stellar populations .",
