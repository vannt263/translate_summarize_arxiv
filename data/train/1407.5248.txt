    "let @xmath0 be a simple @xmath1-vertex graph with vertex set @xmath8 . denote by @xmath9 the distance matrix of @xmath0 , where @xmath10 signifies the length of shortest path between vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "then the adjacency matrix @xmath13 of the graph can be defined by @xmath14 if @xmath15 , and @xmath16 otherwise . since @xmath17 is a real symmetric matrix ,",
    "its eigenvalues are real numbers .",
    "we order the eigenvalues in a non - increasing manner as @xmath18 ( they are customarily called @xmath2-eigenvalues of @xmath0 @xcite ) .",
    "the distance estrada index of @xmath0 is defined as @xmath19    this graph - spectrum - based structural invariant is recently proposed in @xcite , and some results on its bounds can be found in @xcite . if we replace in ( [ 1 ] ) the @xmath2-eigenvalues @xmath20 by the eigenvalues @xmath21 of the adjacency matrix @xmath22 , we recover the well - researched graph descriptor estrada index @xcite .",
    "the estrada index can be used as an efficient measuring tool in a number of areas in chemistry and physics , and its mathematical properties have been intensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite , to mention only a few ) .",
    "apart from its formal analogy to the estrada index , we believe the distance estrada index ( [ 1 ] ) is potentially of vast importance in physical chemistry .",
    "after all , the most natural description of a molecular graph is in terms of the distances  be them geometric or topological  between pairs of vertices .",
    "the oldest distance - based invariant , perhaps , is the wiener index @xcite , which has found useful applications in structure  property correlations ; see e.g. @xcite . in this paper , we aim to establish lower and upper bounds for @xmath5 by using the wiener index , which allows us to gain insight into the relationship between the distance estrada index and the wiener index , and , in particular , gain better understanding of the dependence of the distance estrada index on the concept of distance degree whereby the wiener index is constructed .",
    "we mention that various properties of @xmath17 for some interesting graphs can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give some notations and lemmas .",
    "the bounds for @xmath5 are provided in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the distance estrada index of some concrete graphs , including the buckminsterfullerene @xmath7 , to demonstrate the availability of our obtained results .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple connected @xmath1-vertex graph with vertex set @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the distance matrix of the graph @xmath0 .",
    "the distance degree of a vertex @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 .",
    "this concept first appears in @xcite and is reinvented recently in @xcite under the name of distance degree .",
    "the wiener index @xcite of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath6 , is the sum of the distances between all ( unordered ) pairs of vertices of @xmath0 , that is @xmath27 let @xmath28 be the geometric mean of the distance degrees .",
    "then @xmath29 holds , and equality is attained if and only if @xmath30 ( i.e. , the graph @xmath0 is distance degree regular @xcite ) .",
    "several properties of the spectrum of the distance matrix @xmath17 follows easily from its definition . for @xmath31 ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the @xmath33th spectral moment . since all elements of @xmath17 are integers , all moments @xmath34 are also integral .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath17 is traceless ; and @xmath36 . the following two lemmas will be needed later .",
    "* lemma 1 .",
    "* @xcite__a connected graph @xmath0 has two distinct @xmath2-eigenvalues if and only if @xmath0 is a complete graph . _",
    "_    * lemma 2 . * @xcite__let @xmath37 be nonnegative numbers",
    ". then @xmath38 _ _",
    "our main result reads as follows .",
    "* theorem 1 . * _ let @xmath0 be a connected graph on @xmath1 vertices . denote by @xmath39 the diameter of @xmath0 . then @xmath40 the equality on the left - hand side of ( [ 3 ] ) holds if and only if @xmath0 is the complete graph @xmath41 .",
    "the equality on the right - hand side of ( [ 3 ] ) holds if and only if @xmath42 , i.e. , a single vertex .",
    "_    * remark 1 .",
    "* when @xmath43 , we will have @xmath44 and view the leftmost term of ( [ 3 ] ) as 1 .",
    "* proof*. _ lower bound . _ using the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality , we obtain @xmath45 where we have used the fact that @xmath46 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath47 setting @xmath48 in lemma 2 , we get @xmath49 combining this with ( [ 5 ] ) yields @xmath50 clearly , @xmath44 ( namely , the second equality in ( [ 6 ] ) holds ) if and only if @xmath43 .",
    "it is elementary to show that for @xmath51 the function @xmath52 monotonically increases in the interval @xmath53 ( here we take the limit function @xmath54 when @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , by means of ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) we arrive at the first half of theorem 1 .    note that when @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ". hence , @xmath60 and the equality on the left - hand side of ( [ 3 ] ) holds .",
    "conversely , suppose that the equality holds , then from ( [ 4 ] ) we have @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 6 ] ) that @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath0 has exactly two distinct @xmath2-eigenvalues , and lemma 1 indicates that @xmath0 is the complete graph @xmath41 .    _",
    "upper bound .",
    "_ let @xmath64 be the number of positive @xmath2-eigenvalues of @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath65 which directly leads to the right - hand side inequality in ( [ 3 ] ) .    from the above derivation",
    "it is apparent that equality holds if and only if the graph @xmath0 has all zero @xmath2-eigenvalues . since @xmath0 is a connected graph , this only happens when @xmath42 ( and thus @xmath66 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is completed .",
    "* remark 2 . * in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that @xmath68 if we utilize the property @xmath29 , then we obtain @xmath69 since the function @xmath70 defined in ( [ func ] ) is strictly increasing , we see that our lower bound in ( [ 3 ] ) is better than the bound in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "* remark 3 .",
    "* it was shown in @xcite that @xmath71 since @xmath72 for all @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , our upper bound in ( [ 3 ] ) is better than the bound in ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "if the graph @xmath0 is @xmath76-distance regular for some @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the following result is immediate .",
    "* corollary 1 . *",
    "_ let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath76-distance regular graph on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "denote by @xmath39 the diameter of @xmath0 . then @xmath81 the equality on the left - hand side of ( [ 3a ] )",
    "holds if and only if @xmath0 is the complete graph @xmath41 with @xmath82 .",
    "the equality on the right - hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) holds if and only if @xmath42 , i.e. , a single vertex . _",
    "in this section , we provide some concrete examples to demonstrate the calculations of distance estrada index as well as the feasibility of the above obtained results .",
    "* example 1 . * in this example , the graph @xmath0 is the cycle over @xmath83 vertices , namely , a hexagonal cell .",
    "its distance matrix is shown below @xmath84 since @xmath17 is a circulant matrix , the @xmath2-eigenvalues consist of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . via some simplifications , we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we calculate that @xmath91 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath0 is a connected @xmath76-distance regular graph with @xmath92 .",
    "the diameter is given by @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , from corollary 1 we have the following bounds @xmath94 it turns out that the lower bound is very sharp while the upper bound is conservative in this specific example .",
    "* example 3 .",
    "* in this example , we consider the buckminsterfullerene @xmath7 , which is a well - known member of the fullerene family @xcite . as a graph",
    ", @xmath7 is a truncated icosahedron with @xmath103 vertices and 32 faces ( including 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons ) ; see fig . 2 for an illustration .",
    "the @xmath2-eigenvalues of @xmath7 were computed in @xcite by using the givens - householder method ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , there are exactly 18 positive @xmath2-eigenvalues and no zero @xmath2-eigenvalue . based on these @xmath2-eigenvalues",
    "we calculate by definition ( [ 1 ] ) that @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath7 contains 60 vertices , a wise approach to capture its distance matrix is to understand the associated distance level diagram , as is done in figure 1 of @xcite . from that , we conclude that @xmath7 is a connected @xmath76-distance regular graph with @xmath105 and the diameter is @xmath106 .",
    "hence , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "corollary 1 leads to the following bounds @xmath109 clearly , the upper bound obtained is way above the true value for @xmath110 . future work may study better behaved estimations .",
