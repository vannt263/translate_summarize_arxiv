    "the tutte polynomial is an invariant naturally associated to a matroid and encoding many of its features , such as the number of bases and their _ internal and external activity _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the matroid is realized by a finite list of vectors , it is natural to consider the arrangement obtained by taking the hyperplane orthogonal to each vector .",
    "one associates to the poset of the intersections of the hyperplanes its _ characteristic polynomial _ , which provides a rich combinatorial and topological description of the arrangement ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this polynomial can be obtained as a specialization of the tutte polynomial .",
    "given a complex torus @xmath3 and a finite list @xmath4 of characters , i.e. elements of @xmath5 , we consider the arrangement of hypersurfaces in @xmath6 obtained by taking the kernel of each element of @xmath4 . to understand the geometry of this _ toric arrangement _ one needs to describe the poset @xmath7 of the _ layers _ ,",
    "i.e. connected components of the intersections of the hypersurfaces ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly this poset depends also on the arithmetics of @xmath4 , and not only on its linear algebra : for example , the kernel of the identity character @xmath8 of @xmath9 is the point @xmath10 , but the kernel of @xmath11 has equation @xmath12 , hence is made of two points .",
    "therefore we have no chance to get the characteristic polynomial of @xmath7 as a specialization of the ordinary tutte polynomial @xmath13 of @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we define a polynomial @xmath14 that specializes to the characteristic polynomial of @xmath7 ( theorem [ mch ] ) and to the poincar polynomial of the complement @xmath15 of the toric arrangement ( theorem [ mpo ] ) .",
    "in particular @xmath16 is equal to the euler characteristic of @xmath15 , and also to the number of connected components of the complement of the arrangement in the _ compact torus _ @xmath17 .",
    "we call @xmath14 the _ multiplicity tutte polynomial _ of @xmath4 , since it coincides with @xmath13 when x is unimodular and , in general , it satisfies the same _ deletion - restriction _ recursion that holds for @xmath13 . by this formula ( theorem [ rec ] )",
    "we prove that @xmath14 has positive coefficients ( theorem [ pos ] ) .",
    "we leave open the problem of explaining the meaning of these coefficients ( problem [ intcomb ] ) .",
    "a similar polynomial can be defined more generally for matroids , if we enrich their structure in order to encode some `` arithmetic data '' ; we call such objects _ multiplicity matroids_. we hope to develop in a future paper an axiomatic theory of these matroids , as well as applications to graph theory , which are only outlined here .",
    "the focus of the present paper is in the case we have a list @xmath4 of vectors with integer coordinates .",
    "given such a list , we consider two finite dimensional vector spaces : a space of polynomials @xmath18 defined by differential equations , and a space of quasipolynomials @xmath19 defined by difference equations .",
    "these spaces were introduced by dahmen and micchelli to study _ box splines _ and _ partition functions _ , and are deeply related respectively with the hyperplane arrangement and the toric arrangement defined by @xmath4 , as explained in the recent book @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath20 is known to be the hilbert series of @xmath18 , and we will show that @xmath21 is the hilbert series of @xmath19 ( theorem [ ddm ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , by theorem [ inz ] the coefficients of @xmath22 count integer points in some faces of a convex polytope , the _",
    "zonotope _ defined by @xmath4 .",
    "the relations between zonotopes and dahmen - micchelli spaces is being studied intensively over the last years , giving arise to many algebraic and combinatorial constructions ( see in particular @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular",
    "@xmath23 is equal to the volume of the zonotope ( proposition [ voz ] ) , while @xmath24 is the number of its integer points ( proposition [ m21 ] ) .",

    "we start by recalling the notions we will be generalizing .    a _ matroid _ @xmath25 is a pair @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is a finite set and @xmath27 is a family of subsets of @xmath4 ( called the _ independent sets _ ) with the following properties :    1 .   the empty set is independent ; 2 .",
    "every subset of an independent set is independent ; 3 .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be two independent sets and assume that @xmath28 has more elements than b. then there exists an element @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is still independent .",
    "a maximal independent set is called a _",
    "basis_. the last axiom implies that all bases have the same cardinality , which is called the _",
    "rank _ of the matroid .",
    "every @xmath32 has a natural structure of matroid , defined by considering a subset of @xmath28 independent if and only if it is in @xmath27 .",
    "then each @xmath32 has a rank which we denote by @xmath33 .",
    "the _ tutte polynomial _ of the matroid is then defined as @xmath34    from the definition it is clear that @xmath35 is equal to the number of bases of the matroid .",
    "the interested reader may refer for instance to @xcite , @xcite    in the next sections we will recall the two most important examples of matroid and some properties of their tutte polynomials .",
    "we now introduce the following definitions .    a _ multiplicity matroid _",
    "@xmath25 is a triple @xmath36 , where @xmath26 is a matroid and @xmath37 is a function ( called _ multiplicity _ ) from the family of all subsets of @xmath4 to the positive integers .",

    "moreover , if @xmath49 and @xmath50 have multiplicity functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 defines a multiplicity on @xmath54 .",
    "we notice that the rank of a subset @xmath28 is just the sum of the ranks of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and so it is easily seen that the ( multiplicity ) tutte polynomial of @xmath54 is the product of the ( multiplicity ) tutte polynomials of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finite list of vectors spanning a real vector space @xmath57 , and @xmath27 be the family of its linearly independent subsets .",
    "then @xmath26 is a matroid , and the rank of a subset @xmath28 is just the dimension of the spanned subspace .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the associated tutte polynomial .",
    "we associate to the list @xmath4 a _ zonotope _ , that is a convex polytope in @xmath57 defined as follows : @xmath58 zonotopes play an important role in the theory of hyperplane arrangements , and also in that of _ splines _ , a class of functions studied in approximation theory .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",

    "every such @xmath59 can be generated from some basis of the vector space by forming all linear combinations with integer coefficients ; hence the group @xmath59 is isomorphic to @xmath62 .",
    "we will use always the term _ lattice _ with this meaning , and not in the combinatorial sense ( a poset with _ join _ and _ meet _ ) .    now let @xmath4 be a finite list of elements in a lattice @xmath59 , and",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath63 be as above . for every @xmath64 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively the sublattice of @xmath59 and the subspace of @xmath67 spanned by @xmath28 .",

    "the multiplicity is trivial and @xmath75 .",

    "we define @xmath27 as the set of the _ forests _ in @xmath84 ( subgraphs whose connected components are simply connected ) .",

    "if @xmath84 has neither loops nor multiple edges , let us take a vector space @xmath88 with basis @xmath89 bijective to @xmath85 , and associate to the edge connecting two vertices @xmath90 and @xmath91 the vector @xmath92 . in this way",
    "we get a list @xmath93 of vectors bijective to @xmath4 and spanning a hyperplane @xmath57 in @xmath88 .",
    "since in this bijection the rank is preserved and forests correspond to linearly independent sets , @xmath84 and @xmath93 define the same matroid and have the same tutte polynomial .",
    "now let us assume every edge @xmath94 to have an integer label @xmath95 . by defining @xmath96",
    "we get a multiplicity matroid and then a multiplicity tutte polynomial @xmath97 .",
    "we may view the labels @xmath98 as multiplicities of the edges in the following way .",
    "let us define a new graph @xmath99 with the same vertices as @xmath84 , but with @xmath98 edges connecting the two vertices incident to @xmath94 .",
    "now let @xmath100 be the set of _ simple _ subgraphs of @xmath99 , i.e subgraphs with at most one edge connecting any two vertices , and at most one loop on every vertex .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath101    in particular , @xmath102 is equal to the number of forests of @xmath99 , and @xmath103 the number of _ spanning trees _",
    "( i.e. , trees connecting all the vertices ) of @xmath99 .",
    "the central idea that inspired tutte in defining the polynomial @xmath104 was to find the most general invariant satisfying a recursion known as _ deletion - restriction_. such a recursion allows to reduce the computation of the tutte polynomial to some trivial cases .",
    "in the two examples above ( when the matroid is defined by a list of vectors or by a graph ) , the polynomial @xmath0 satisfies a similar recursion .",

    "assume that @xmath8 is dependent in @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "we have the following well - known formula :    [ ret ] @xmath109    it is now clear why we defined @xmath4 as a list , and not as a set : even if we start with @xmath4 composed by distinct ( nonzero ) elements , some vectors in @xmath45 may appear many times ( and some vectors may be zero ) .    notice that by applying the above formula recursively , our problem reduces to computing @xmath110 when @xmath111 is the union of a list @xmath112 of @xmath113 linearly independent vectors and of a list @xmath114 of @xmath115 zero vectors ( @xmath116 ) . in this case",
    "the tutte polynomial is easily computed .",
    "@xmath117    given any @xmath118 , since @xmath119 by remark [ sum ] we have that @xmath120 hence by induction we get that @xmath121 .",

    "thus we get:[pot ]    @xmath13 is a polynomial with positive coefficients .",
    "we now want to show a similar recursion for the polynomial @xmath14 .",
    "inspired by @xcite , we noticed that we need to work in a larger category .",
    "indeed , whereas the quotient of a vector space by a subspace is still a vector space , the quotient of a lattice by a sublattice is not a lattice , but a _ finitely generated abelian group_. for example , in the 1-dimensional case , the quotient of @xmath73 by @xmath123 is the cyclic group of order @xmath37 .",
    "then let @xmath124 be a finitely generated abelian group .",
    "for every subset @xmath125 of @xmath124 we denote by @xmath126 the generated subgroup .",

    "furthermore , this polynomial evaluated at @xmath138 , gives the order of @xmath124 .",
    "indeed the only summand that does not vanish is the contribution of the empty set , which generates the trivial subgroup .",
