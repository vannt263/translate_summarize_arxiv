    "for example , @xcite use semi - analytic models - while e.g. @xcite use hydrodynamical simulations - to generate star formation functions luminosity functions , which give the number density of galaxies as a function of ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "this intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity function is practically the same as a star formation function . ] , and then use ly@xmath0 luminosity functions to constrain @xmath7 at @xmath147 .",
    "importantly , the models that are used to generate the theoretical star formation functions are typically constrained by observations . however , these ( almost the same ) observations can be converted directly into star formation functions , i.e. without generating the intermediate theoretical model . indeed , our method completely circumvents this intermediate step . the fact that we can side - step this ( substantial ) part of the calculations allow us to more efficiently explore a larger suite of models for @xmath7 , and to explore the impact of uncertainties with the observationally inferred star formation functions on our results .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with these previous theoretical studies : @xcite find that @xmath149 at @xmath50 , which is in excellent agreement with our results .",
    "@xcite find @xmath150 at @xmath6 , which is a factor of @xmath151 lower than what we find .",
    "the origin of this difference is unclear , but the _ lower right panel _ of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows that the value preferred by @xcite ( @xmath152 ) is not ruled out at great significance .",

    "hayes et al . ( 2011 ) show that if this top - heavy imf is replaced with a standard salpeter imf , that then the constraints obtained by @xcite agree well with @xcite at @xmath147 .    finally , @xcite showed that while their models with a constant @xmath7 fit the data well ( in good agreement with our work ) , they obtain better fits using so - called ` duty cycle ' models , in which @xmath155 .",
    "these models represent a scenario in which star forming galaxies only have non - zero @xmath7 for a fraction @xmath156 of their lifetimes .",
    "we note that this may also represent a scenario in which ly@xmath0 escapes anisotropically from galaxies , and in which @xmath157 only along a fraction @xmath156 of the sightlines from them .",
    "the duty cycle parameter @xmath156 can also be incorporated in the @xmath7-pdf , simply by adding a dirac - delta function at @xmath118 ( after which we must renormalize the full - pdf ) .",
    "we have repeated our analysis including a duty cycle of @xmath158 into our @xmath7-pdf , and found that these models flatten the predicted luminosity functions , similarly to models with a non - zero scatter in @xmath7 .",
    "these ` duty - cycle model ' therefore provide somewhat better fits to the luminosity functions ( for models with @xmath159 ) , mostly because they improve the fits at the bright ends ( just as our models with @xmath85 ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "moreover , the best - fit _ expectation values _ of @xmath7 in these duty cycle models along sightlines ( or during time - intervals ) where @xmath157 with @xmath160 . the overall expectation value is then given by @xmath161 . ]",

    "a potential caveat is that ( some of ) our adopted ly@xmath0 luminosity functions were constructed from narrow - band surveys .",
    "such surveys do not only impose a ly@xmath0 flux cut , but in practice also a cut in ly@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "for example , @xcite adopt color - color criteria to select laes at @xmath50 that translate ( roughly ) to ew@xmath162  .",
    "we may worry that this data - set therefore misses a significant fraction of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "in practise however , the equivalent width cut does not appear to affect determinations of the ly@xmath0 luminosity functions : @xcite present a luminosity function at @xmath50 that agrees well with @xcite , even though they effectively apply a different ew - cut of ew@xmath163  . moreover , cassata et al .",

    "our analysis uses schechter functions to describe the star formation rate functions .",

    "however , at @xmath167 it cuts off as a gaussian in log - space with a standard deviation @xmath86 , instead of the sharper exponential cut - off of the schechter function in real - space .",
    "@xcite show that schechter functions typically predict ( slightly ) fewer galaxies at the largest @xmath8 compared to the actual observations ( see e.g. fig  5 of smit et al .",
    "2012 , and fig  2 of salim & lee 2012 ) , because of their exponential cut - off at @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath85 we can boost @xmath169 by a factor of @xmath170 a few at the high-@xmath8 end , which may help resolve this issue .",
    "we repeated our analysis in which we replaced schechter functions with saunders functions ( using @xmath85 , and keeping the other parameters fixed ) , and found that this did not change our results at all .",
    "however , this may become more relevant in the future with larger lae surveys which can probe down to larger ly@xmath0 luminosities ( and likely larger values of @xmath8 ) .      in   [ sec :",
    "intro ] we mentioned that empirical constraints on @xmath7 may help us understand the basics of ly@xmath0 transport in and around galaxies .",
    "our work has several implications :    * our best - fit @xmath171 at @xmath6 .",
    "models that have studied the impact of the igm on the visibilty of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from galaxies at this redshift , consistently conclude that the alone igm should transmit only @xmath172 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of photons through an ionized universe at @xmath173 . under the reasonable assumption that dust suppresses the emerging ly@xmath0 flux by an additional factor",
    ", these models would predict effective escape fractions that appear inconsistent with our inferred fraction ( and also that of hayes et al .",
    "a plausible reason for this discrepancy is that the models overestimate the igm opacity , because they do not include the impact of outflows of optically thick ( to ly@xmath0 photons ) hi gas on the ly@xmath0 spectral line profile emerging from galaxies .",
    "winds are known to redshift ly@xmath0 photons out of the line resonance , which can strongly increase the fraction of photons transmitted through the igm ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting that current constraints on @xmath7 provide evidence for winds impacting the ly@xmath0 radiative transfer at @xmath173 . *",
    "our work has also shown that it is possible to reproduce ly@xmath0 luminosity functions with a constant ( @xmath8-independent ) @xmath7 , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we have shown that this applies over a wider range of observed ly@xmath0 luminosities ( by adding the data from cassata et al .",
    "2010 to the data from ouchi et al .",
    "2008 which was used in most previous analyses ) .",
    "we have shown that we ` flatten ' the predicted luminosity functions by adding a dispersion in @xmath7 and/or a ` duty cycle ' ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "this flattening can improve the fit to the observed luminosity function at the bright end .",
    "if we flatten the predicted luminosity functions even more ( by increasing the dispersion , or reducing the duty cycle ) , then we need to invoke that @xmath7 decreases towards higher @xmath8 , which appears to be favored by the observed increase ` ly@xmath0 fraction ' towards fainter drop - out galaxies ( see   [ sec : withscat ] ) .",
    "the two points combined appear to favor scenarios in which ly@xmath0 photons escape from laes through an outflowing ism .",
    "this would explain the large value of @xmath7 that has been inferred from the data at @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore , a large scatter in @xmath7 has been shown to arise naturally in models for laes in which ly@xmath0 photons scatter through spherically symmetric outflows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see orsi et al .",
    "alternatively , the large scatter in @xmath7 may also reflect anisotropic escape of ly@xmath0 photons from galaxies ( as in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we have constrained the ` effective escape ' fraction of ly@xmath0 photons , @xmath7 , which is defined as the ratio of the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy to its intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "this ratio is often referred to in the literature simply as an escape fraction . in   [ sec : fobsvsfesc ] we have argued why we caution against universal usage of the term escape fraction , and why it helps to distinguish between an escape fraction and an effective escape fraction .",
    "we have constrained the effective escape fraction by converting observed star formation functions to observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions .",
    "this conversion depends directly on @xmath7 , and we use observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions at @xmath40 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 to get constraints on @xmath7 at these redshifts .",
    "we have explored models in which @xmath7 takes on a single value (   [ sec : noscat ] ) , and in which @xmath7 has a dispersion (   [ sec : withscat ] ) .",
    "models which include a dispersion predict flatter luminosity functions , which appear to be in better agreement with the observations .",
    "we note that the flattening predicted by these models can not be captured by schechter functions ( a saunders function as in eq  [ eq : saun ] would likely be more appropriate ) .",
    "we found that the effective escape fraction ( or its expectation value in a distribution ) @xmath174 at @xmath2 , and that it increases to @xmath3 at @xmath4 , and to @xmath175 at @xmath6 ( see fig  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "eq  [ eq : fit ] provides a convenient fitting formula that encapsulates our main findings .",

    "* ) , except at @xmath176 where our inferred @xmath7 is higher than previous works",

    "this hints at the importance of winds in the ly@xmath0 transfer process even at this high redshift .",
    "we have shown that we can reproduce observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions in individual redshift bins with a constant - i.e. independent of @xmath8- @xmath7 over up to two orders in @xmath8 and ly@xmath0 luminosity ( see fig  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , in agreement with previous work .",
    "we require @xmath7 to decrease with @xmath8 - as appears to be favored by observations of drop - out galaxies ( see   [ sec : withscat])- only in models which include a large scatter ( @xmath10 dex ) in @xmath7 , or in which star forming galaxies only have a non - zero @xmath7 for a fraction @xmath156 of their life - time and/or a fraction of sightlines ( see   [ sec : modelunc ] ) .",
    "we anticipate that observations of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies in the near future ( e.g. with muse , hyper suprime - cam and by hetdex ) will determine the ly@xmath0 luminosity functions over a wider range of luminosities , and reduce their systematic uncertainties .",
