    "hawking radiation is one of the most intriguing yet unobserved predictions of modern physics .",
    "it is believed to be generated near the horizon surrounding a black hole and to be responsible for its ultimate decay @xcite .",
    "as noted by unruh @xcite , a phenomenon analog to hawking radiation should occur near a sonic horizon in a moving fluid , i.e. near the interface separating regions of subsonic and supersonic current .",
    "he argued that a thermal flux of phonons should be spontaneously generated from the sonic horizon towards the subsonic region .",
    "the effect finds its origin in the impossibility of defining a global quasiparticle vacuum which suits both incoming and outgoing states .",
    "more recently , it has been proposed that flowing condensates of bosonic atoms could provide interesting analogs of black hole physics @xcite and in particular of their hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the interface between subsonic and supersonic regions has also been shown to provide a scenario for the bosonic analog of andreev reflection @xcite .    except for black hole lasers ( discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , most proposals predict a spectrum ( phonon current distribution per unit frequency ) with a single peak at frequency @xmath0 falling as @xmath1 for small @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the quasiparticle energy measured with respect to the condensate chemical potential .",
    "this means that the low - frequency peak is essentially thermal in character .",
    "however , because of dispersive effects , the effective temperature characterizing that zero - point radiation is no longer universal . in a bose - einstein condensate ,",
    "the group velocity of phonons increases at high frequency , unlike in the original model considered by unruh @xcite . as a result ,",
    "superluminal \" transport dilutes the sonic horizon into a spatial interval of finite size @xcite .",
    "the blue - shifting effect accompanying with the sonic horizon implies that the dispersive properties of phonons are always involved .",
    "nevertheless , when the dispersive length scale is much smaller than the horizon curvature scale , the temperature is determined by the local properties of condensate flow near the horizon ( the gradient of the flow  @xcite ) in strict analogy with the standard hawking radiation which is fixed by the surface gravity of the black hole .",
    "this regime is found when the gradient is much smaller than one in units of the healing length  @xcite . instead ,",
    "when it is higher than one , the dispersion effects dominate and as a result the effective temperature is fixed by the healing length and the jump of the velocities across the sonic horizon  @xcite . in any case , the effective temperature will be smaller than the chemical potential @xcite . as a consequence , a direct attempt to measure this radiation profile appears extremely difficult . an alternative proposal to indirectly measure hawking radiation relies on the squeezed character of the state @xcite which could be observed at currently attainable temperatures by counting atoms on both sides of the horizon at coinciding times .",
    "however it should be pointed out that the main contribution to these correlations are due to the stimulated amplification of pre - existing phonons @xcite , and not to the spontaneous amplification of vacuum fluctuations .    here",
    "we study a new method which specifically aims at detecting the spontaneous contribution to hawking radiation .",
    "this approach relies on the strong frequency - dependence of resonant tunneling through a double barrier structure .",
    "such a sonic black - hole analog behaves as a fabry - perot resonator for quasiparticles , with the peculiar feature that quasiparticles propagate linearly against a condensate background which is itself governed by a nonlinear equation .",
    "the hawking emitted phonon spectrum shows peaks at frequencies different from zero .",
    "we find that , at currently achievable temperatures , thermal noise could be weak enough not to blur the characteristics of this resonant radiation , and a time - of - flight experiment could allow for its detection .",
    "our proposal is quite similar to the black - hole laser setup @xcite in that sharp peaks are found in both cases .",
    "however , although dynamical instabilities may appear occasionally , they are not a necessary feature of these type of setups ( see section [ qnm.sect ] ) .",
    "we propose here to focus on situations that are dynamically stable , i.e. where all peaks are due to resonances .",
    "the dynamical stability of the flow is likely to be a valuable asset in actual experiments .",
    "a systematic study of resonances and instabilities is currently under investigation .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in section ii we present a mean - field study of the considered setup , discuss the main results and some general features .",
    "section iii is devoted to formulate the scattering problem of bogoliubov quasiparticles propagating against the condensate background and to identify the essential features of hawking radiation . in section",
    "iv we present and discuss the numerical results obtained for the hawking radiation spectrum emitted from a double delta - barrier interface separating a subsonic and a supersonic region .",
    "section v deals with the general distinction between quasinormal modes ( or resonances ) and dynamical instabilities , both of which are candidates to lie behind the sharp peaks in the radiation spectrum .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to a summary and discussion of the main results .",
    "the main text is complemented by two appendices .",
    "appendix a presents the analytical calculation of the mean - field model .",
    "appendix b deals with the analytical resolution of the quasiparticle eigenvalue problem in the inhomogeneous region on the subsonic and supersonic sides near the double - barrier interface .",
    "we study an atom transport setup which is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ figddsampleplot ] . a quasi-1d bosonic condensate , which occupies the left region @xmath4 , is allowed to leak to the right though two identical delta potential barriers .",
    "the leftmost barrier is conventionally placed at @xmath5 separated by a distance @xmath6 from the second barrier .",
    "we will see that this double - barrier setup behaves as a resonant structure . for convenience ,",
    "we neglect quantum fluctuations of the condensate stemming from its one - dimensional character @xcite .    we may decompose the heisenberg second - quantized field operator @xmath7 into a stationary condensate wave - function @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the chemical potential , and its fluctuations @xmath10 . in this section",
    "we focus on the condensate behavior . at low temperatures and densities , the mean - field equation which governs",

    "the healing length on the asymptotic upstream side is @xmath17 .    in both the single- and double - barrier case",
    ", solutions can be found in which the condensate velocity is supersonic on the right of the second barrier , and subsonic from @xmath18 to some point in the vicinity of the leftmost ( @xmath5 ) barrier ( see appendix [ mft.app ] for a general discussion of these solutions )",
    ". those flow profiles must have one or more horizons , defined as points where the local condensate velocity equals the local speed of sound .",
    "this subsonic - supersonic scenario is the same which has been shown to display the bosonic analog of andreev reflection , where the supersonic side plays the role of the normal fluid @xcite .",
    "thus one may generally speak of andreev - hawking processes when dealing with scattering events undergone by elementary excitations of condensate flow through a subsonic - supersonic interface .",
    "such sonic analogs relying on condensate flow have a superluminal dispersion relation at higher frequencies and their horizons do not imply a strict causal disconnection among regions , but they are sufficient to produce hawking radiation analogs ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of a scenario where horizons would not be needed ) . for the case of a single delta barrier",
    "the only horizon lies on the near left of the barrier .",
    "the double barrier case is richer : there appears one horizon in the vicinity of the @xmath5 barrier ( which may lie on either side ) and possibly one or more horizon pairs .",
    "the leftmost horizon , and the only one in the single delta barrier case , can be viewed as a black hole ( bh ) analog , because there the flow goes from the subsonic to the supersonic side .",
    "the possible additional pairs of horizons appearing in a double barrier structure are the analogs of white - hole / black - hole pairs , where a white hole ( wh ) is the time - reversed version of a bh .",
    "white hole analogs seem to be extremely difficult to generate experimentally .",
    "there is a debate in the literature on whether white holes are stable at all , a question to which linear stability analysis has not yet provided an answer @xcite .    to clearly identify what constitutes hawking radiation",
    ", the experiment should ideally be done in such a way that the condensate wave - function is stationary and asymptotically flat : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 @xcite . in appendix [ mft.app ] we show that , with those homogenous boundary conditions , there is one or more mean - field solutions for two delta potential barriers , and just one for a single delta barrier .",
    "a sketch of a typical density for two delta barriers is shown in fig .",
    "[ figddsampleplot ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figdeltastrengthplot ] we plot the region of the @xmath21 plane for which stationary solutions with homogeneous boundary conditions exist to the double - barrier problem .",
    "we recall that @xmath16 is the dimensionless parameter characterizing the strength of the two identical delta barriers , while @xmath22 is the condensate momentum on the subsonic ( upstream ) side .",
    "we note that , for a given value of @xmath22 , there is a minimum and a maximum barrier strength between which a solution is guaranteed to exist for that particular value of @xmath22 .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of the single barrier case , for which only one solution exists for a given value of @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the resulting line @xmath23 line for the single - barrier case coincides with the upper boundary of the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ figdeltastrengthplot ] .",
    "figure [ figphasediagplot ] shows a representative sample of solutions in the @xmath24 plane , where @xmath6 is the distance between barriers .",

    "figure [ figphasediagplot ] reveals that , for given @xmath16 and @xmath22 , a multiplicity of @xmath6 solutions exist .",
    "the two lowest @xmath6 values can be characterized by two different values of @xmath25 , which we call @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the upper @xmath6 solutions come also in pairs and are regularly separated by a distance difference equal to the period of the nonlinear oscillations between the two barriers , which is the same for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "an interesting feature is that , at small barrier separations , a single @xmath22 solution exists for a given @xmath6 and @xmath16 . for higher",

    "since the barrier separation @xmath6 and the barrier strength @xmath16 are expected to be experimentally adjustable parameters , the clear trend is that , the larger the distance , the higher the number of allowed stationary solutions , a fact which could translate itself into instabilities .",

    "downstream ( right graph ) we have two incoming and two outgoing solutions , corresponding to the normal ( d1 ) and anomalous ( d2 ) channels . for instance , a conventional retarded scattering state is characterized by one incoming channel matching all possible outgoing and evanescent solutions , with no amplitude for exploding or other incoming solutions .",
    "an instability is a bound state made exclusively of spatially decaying solutions that happen to match at a particular complex frequency ( with positive imaginary part ) .",

    "figure [ figcomplexkplot ] shows how the various @xmath67 solutions evolve as @xmath36 varies from im@xmath110 to im@xmath104 while re@xmath108 remains constant .",
    "eventual instabilities can only be obtained by matching the evolved `` u - out '' and `` evanescent '' solutions upstream ( im@xmath111 ) and the evolved  d1-out \" and  d2-out \" downstream ( im@xmath112 ) , with vanishing amplitudes for the other solutions .",
    "we emphasize that the wave function of these unstable modes involves exclusively analytical continuations of outgoing and evanescent solutions .",
    "qnm modes , on the other hand , are obtained from the analytical continuation to the im@xmath103 half - plane of the retarded green s function of the time - dependent version of the bogoliubov - degennes equations ( [ bdgdim.eq ] ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion in an optical context but precisely translatable to the present one ) .",
    "more specifically , these qnms can be obtained as an analytical continuation to im@xmath103 of scattering states involving only outgoing and evanescent solutions , i.e. without the intervention of incoming waves . like for instabilities , a discrete number of qnms is to be expected .",
    "therefore , in order to find resonances , we are only interested in the evolution of `` u - out '' and `` evanescent '' solutions on the upstream side , and  d1-out \" and  d2-out \" on the downstream side , ruling out the other solutions .",
    "interestingly , this is exactly the same set of solutions which are relevant in the search for instabilities .",
    "we conclude that instabilities and resonances are obtained from the matching of the same set of solutions albeit in different regions of the complex energy plane .",
    "hence , qnm / instabilities correspond to poles of the @xmath74 matrix when analytically continued to the lower / upper complex plane from the real energy line .",
    "this can be readily seen if one allows for a general coefficient in the in - wave component of the scattering solution eq .",
    "( [ d2-in.eq ] ) , for example .",
    "so both resonances and instabilities are candidates to explain peaks in the square of a given @xmath74 matrix coefficient .",
    "the frequency of those possible underlying modes must of course have an imaginary part much smaller than their real part .",
    "since the determinant of the @xmath74 matrix is a pure phase ( as noted in the previous section ) , it can be used to discriminate between both behaviors .",
    "specifically , a jump upwards / downwards of the phase when traversing the peak with increasing frequency , implies a qnm / instability .",
    "figure [ grhawkingplot ] , together with other not shown data , reveals that peaks in the hawking spectrum are mostly due to resonances , instabilities being more the exception than the norm .",
    "while this sampling is encouraging , a systematic search for qnms and instabilities in various stationary flows is left for future work .",
    "finally we note that , both for qnms and instabilities , the boundary conditions here described are different from those adopted in ref . @xcite .",
    "we have studied the flow of an atomic condensate through a double barrier interface separating regions of subsonic and supersonic flow .",
    "such a setup provides a scenario where hawking radiation into the subsonic side is enhanced at some frequencies due to multiple scattering of quasiparticles by the two barriers and the modulations of the condensate .",
    "the resulting highly non - thermal hawking radiation presents peaks at frequencies which may lie well above the working temperature and thus can be unambiguously interpreted as stemming from quantum fluctuations of the quasiparticle vacuum . the non - thermal hawking spectrum emitted by the double barrier interface represents and important advantage over the cases of single or zero barrier , where the low - frequency zero - point radiation has a thermal character which makes it more difficult to distinguish from genuinely thermal radiation .",
    "our calculation has been based on a model of stationary flow of condensate and quasiparticles through a double barrier structure with open boundary conditions , where the condensate density is asymptotically flat on both sides of the structure , while quasiparticle motion is described by scattering states characterized by incoming channels that are thermally populated .",
    "while a stationary scattering picture of transport has proved to hold predictive power in electron systems , it still represents an idealized scenario in cold atom contexts , where stationary circuits have not yet been developed and where transport of finite - sized condensates is mostly investigated within a time - dependent scheme @xcite . as long as steady condensate transport is still an item for the future",
    ", it will be of interest to perform numerical simulations of time - dependent transport that may reveal those features of the andreev - hawking phenomena which we have explored here .",
    "an important question is whether , in currently achievable setups , the resonance frequency can be tuned to lie well above the currently attainable temperatures that would characterize the incoming quasiparticle population .",
    "we have seen that , while in a time - of - flight experiment the contribution from hawking radiation peaks may be easily overshadowed by the contribution of the depletion cloud , setups can be designed where the resonant hawking peaks are sufficiently sharp to be clearly visible even at temperatures comparable to the chemical potential .",
