    "the conservation of electric charge is one of the best established , least questioned laws of physics  @xcite . while scenarios where charge is not conserved have been proposed ( see below for an incomplete list ) , these correspond to exotic situations , and the charge of the universe is usually assumed to vanish .",
    "the present work focuses on the fact that , even if electric charge is exactly conserved as a global quantity , during inflation with hubble parameter @xmath0 large scale charge fluctuations are generated if there exist charged particles with mass @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",

    "we will estimate the typical magnitude of the average charge density @xmath2 in a volume of radius @xmath3 by computing its variance right after inflation .",
    "the constraints on the electric charge density @xmath4 of the universe are tight , @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 is the number density of baryons  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for previous analyses that did not account for the large conductivity of the primordial plasma ) . for charged massive _",

    ". however , the charge density accumulated in _ very light charged scalar _ particles can be much larger , and can exceed by several orders of magnitude the bounds of  @xcite in the limit of a massless scalar species .    one might worry that the electric field produced by the charge inhomogeneities during inflation can oppose charge separation or annihilate the charges via schwinger effect . as we will see , this is typically not the case , even if in some instances the schwinger effect can be relevant .",
    "the idea that the universe might carry a net electric charge dates back to the work of lyttleton and bondi  @xcite , who assumed @xmath9 to explain the recession of distant galaxies , while in the 60s alfvn and klein  @xcite considered a cosmology where charge separation would play a central role .",
    "the possibility of a charge imbalance , analogous to that of  @xcite , but confined to dark matter was discussed more recently in  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite considered the generation of a net charge caused by the spontaneous breaking of the electromagnetic gauge symmetry ( used in  @xcite to generate cosmological magnetic fields ) , and  @xcite has shown that the same effect is produced by a photon mass .",
    "the authors of  @xcite discussed the possibility that electric charge is not conserved in brane world models .",
    "closer to our work , a massive charged scalar during inflation was discussed in  @xcite , whose focus , however , was on the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "the system of  @xcite was reanalyzed in  @xcite , where the current charge density of the universe was also estimated in the case of a massless charged scalar .",
    "a charged curvaton was considered in  @xcite , where it was argued that the charge density should not survive until the end of inflation because of schwinger pair production . in  @xcite ,",

    "we define the average charge density @xmath2 in a volume of radius @xmath3 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the charge density operator for the form of matter under consideration .",
    "since electric charge is conserved , and any initial charge density will be rapidly driven to zero by inflation , @xmath12 . however the _ variance _ of @xmath2 will not vanish and its square root will give the typical size of the charge density in a sphere of radius @xmath3 . if we define the charge power spectrum @xmath13 @xmath14 with @xmath15 , it is then straightforward to prove that @xmath16 we will be caring about the limit of large @xmath3 , so that we will need to compute only @xmath13 for @xmath17 .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in the number density of ( anti)particles , it is crucial to work with normal - ordered operators to avoid divergences . the rigorous way of normal - ordering operators in a time - dependent background is to compute the bogolyubov coefficients , as we will discuss below and in appendix  [ app : bogos ] . to our knowledge",

    "( [ gauss ] ) is vanishing and the electric field is negligible . on the other hand , the discussion of section  [ sub : scalars ] above shows that most of the contribution to the electric charge of the universe comes from the very infrared modes with @xmath116 .",

    "another possibility is that the electric field produced by the charge fluctuations ends up annihilating the fluctuations themselves via schwinger effect .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath133 . by evaluating numerically the condition that @xmath121 be smaller both than @xmath134 and than @xmath135",
    "we obtain that , for @xmath131 , the schwinger effect can be efficient if @xmath136 . as we stated above ,",
    "if the field @xmath117 is a scalar , then its large scale fluctuations will contribute to @xmath137 via a higgs effect , yielding @xmath126 .",

    "it is worth noting that , since we do not know what is the expectation value of the higgs field ( or of any other scalar field that carries standard model charge ) during inflation , the mass of the particles of the standard model will generally have mass that is different from the one measured today .",
    "after inflation ends , the charged fermions and scalars considered above will decay into ordinary matter .",

    "if one or more electrically charged species have a mass smaller than the hubble parameter during inflation , then our universe will typically carry a net electric charge .",
    "we have found that each species whose mass is of the order of the hubble parameter contributes a charge density that is @xmath156 order of magnitude below the observational limits .",
    "very light scalars , however , can contribute much more charge density , and in the limit of massless scalars the resulting charge density can exceed by seven ( or more , depending on the duration of inflation ) orders of magnitude the constraints of  @xcite , unless the hubble parameter during inflation is well below the `` high scale inflation '' regime @xmath157  gev .    we should point out that our analysis concerns the simpler regime of constant mass particles during inflation with constant hubble parameter . while it is straightforward to extend our conclusions to the case of adiabatically evolving @xmath19 or @xmath0 , it would be especially interesting consider the case where the parameters in the theory are rapidly evolving , for instance as a consequence of a phase transition .",
