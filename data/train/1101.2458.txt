    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has detected over 500 grbs in its first 2 years of operation .",
    "a forthcoming catalog @xcite contains time - integrated and time - resolved spectra for nearly all bursts during this time frame . with 12 sodium iodide ( nai ) detectors and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) detectors , gbm covers a wide energy band from 8 kev up to 40 mev with roughly 2000 square centimeters of total detector surface area @xcite .",
    "this energy range effectively samples the prompt emission of grbs and allows for rapid all - sky triggering and monitoring . to gather information about the grb afterglow properties , redshift , and jet opening angle ,",
    "other instruments are required . since gbm",
    "can only localize a burst to 4 degree accuracy including systematic uncertainties @xcite , a simultaneous detection with _",
    "swift _ is usually required to derive a precise location for follow - up observations .",
    "_ swift _ comprises a burst alert telescope ( bat ) , an x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and an ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot ) @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ prompt energy coverage extends from 20  150 kev , which does not allow for a comprehensive study of the higher energy prompt emission of grbs which normally peaks at a few hundred kev .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the synergy between gbm and _ swift _ results in a better understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "however , since there are relatively few grbs that have been simultaneously detected by _ swift _ and gbm , we are motivated to extend the ability to determine intrinsic properties of grbs , such as jet opening angles and energetics , to the gbm observations of the prompt emission alone , using _",
    "swift _ afterglow studies for calibration .",
    "current grb theories assume that the explosions are collimated rather than isotropic , because otherwise the extreme energy outflow in gamma - rays during the prompt emission would eliminate many of the viable stellar mass progenitor models @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite proposed observable , achromatic ` jet ' breaks in the broadband afterglow light curves of grbs to distinguish the jet collimation opening angle before such breaks were discovered @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that grbs are collimated , yet few well - constrained jet angles have been unambiguously identified .",
    "further , nearly all estimated jet opening angles have been for the long soft class of grbs , while there are no constrained estimates for the short hard class @xcite , most likely because short grb afterglows are fainter and are thus less likely to be monitored long enough to detect a break @xcite . in addition , precise locations are required and time must be requested of various observatories over a broad spectral range to study the late - time afterglow from minutes to days after the prompt emission .",
    "several observational constraints and effects can hamper the identification of jet breaks such as gaps in temporal and spectral coverage and the presence of optical bumps in the light curve and x - ray flares . even if a jet break is detected , an assumption of the density of the circumburst medium is required @xcite , and so a certain amount of uncertainty is inherent in the calculation of the jet opening angle .",
    "once determined , jet opening angles can lead to an estimate of the total energy release in gamma - rays .",
    "if the redshift and the prompt emission fluence of the grb are also known , the collimation - corrected energy release at the source will provide the total energy budget of the grb .",
    "these results constrain progenitor models and provide an estimate of the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "in addition , a more reliable and robust study of cosmology would be possible if a large number of collimation - corrected energies were known @xcite .",
    "such studies are currently incomplete due to small statistics . for example , out of nearly 500 grbs detected by gbm through july 2010 , only 30 have observed redshifts from the simultaneous detection by _ swift _ , and of these 30 grbs only 8 have inferred jet opening angles from afterglow studies .",
    "the importance of grbs to cosmology has recently become very clear with the detection of bursts out to a @xmath2 of 8.2 @xcite , making these events among the farthest detected in the observable universe .",
    "many authors have studied the spectral properties such as the peak luminosity ; isotropic energy release in gamma - rays , @xmath3 ; the peak energy of the grb power density spectrum , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that we can provide an alternative to the afterglow lightcurve monitoring method by deriving jet opening angles from the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "we then utilize the opening angles to estimate the collimation - corrected energy release in gamma - rays , @xmath1 , and show that there is a tight correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section 2 describes the data sample and section 3 consists of our data analysis methods and results .",
    "finally , we discuss the cosmological consequences and implications for progenitors of our study in section 4 .",
    "two data samples were used in this study . the ` redshift ' sample consists of 30 bursts from the first 2-year gbm catalog as well as 3 more bursts in the third year ( grb 100724a , 100814a , and 100816a ) .",
    "all other bursts ( without redshift ) were chosen by selecting events from the entire gbm catalog from the first two years @xcite according to the following data selection cuts .",
    "first , the spectral data were retrieved from fits performed with the standard gbm spectral fitting program , rmfit .",
    "two models were investigated : the band grb function @xcite , which comprises two power laws smoothly joined at a break energy that is unique to each burst ; and a ` comptonized ' model , which is a power law with a high - energy exponential cutoff .",
    "both models were parametrized with the @xmath0 parameter , which is the energy at which peak power production is measured .",
    "both models well describe nearly 80% of all grb spectra , though the both functions are purely empirical and are not derived from physical quantities .",
    "the fitting statistic used in rmfit is the castor c - statistic , a modification of the cash statistic @xcite . for each burst ,",
    "a model comparison was performed by calculating the change in likelihood between the two models and determining the corresponding chi - square distribution for 1 degree of freedom ( as the comptonized model has one more degree of freedom and is nested within the band model ) .",
    "we choose a change in likelihood of 6 units per one degree of freedom , which has a chance probability of about @xmath4 , as a threshold for a model to be preferred .",
    "the values of interest in our study are @xmath0 and fluence , so a data cut was performed on the error in @xmath0 and the fluence . only those bursts that had an error of 40% or less of the mean value of the quantity of interest were allowed into the sample .",
    "this was done to ensure the integrity of our data sample and the following analysis .",
    "to begin , we investigate a new discriminator between two types of bursts ( long and short ) , the @xmath0/fluence energy ratio @xcite , which was discovered using batse data .",
    "this ratio provides a measure of spectral hardness similar to that found by @xcite , but it is independent of redshift in energy and is directly related to the luminosity distance . shown in figure 1 is the distribution of 382 grbs from the gbm spectral catalog @xcite . using the preliminary duration results from the upcoming gbm grb catalog @xcite",
    ", the figure strongly supports the original claim by @xcite and shows the distribution separated into long bursts and short bursts , and a correspondence has been found between the energy ratio and the observed duration estimate of the bursts .    in an attempt to relate the rest - frame @xmath0 with the total energy release in gamma - rays , @xcite discovered a correlation between the rest - frame @xmath0 and @xmath6 , the bolometric energy release in gamma - rays assuming isotropic emission .",
    "the correlation is highly susceptible to scatter and outliers , and may be a result of selection effects due to detector trigger and spectral criteria @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar correlation using @xmath1 , the collimation - corrected energy release .",
    "the so - called ghirlanda relation contains less scatter and fewer outliers , but requires an additional piece of information , the jet opening angle .",
    "both of these correlations require the redshift of the grb , yet previous papers @xcite have devised a way to test the correlations with grbs that have no observed redshift .",
    "we adopt this test to show in figure 2 the lower limits of the amati and ghirlanda relations in the @xmath0fluence plane , and we find that very few bursts ( @xmath7% ) can follow the amati relation , though all gbm bursts may be valid for the ghirlanda relation .",
    "more importantly , we plot the long and short bursts separately for gbm and we find that most long bursts are clustered between the amati and ghirlanda lower limits , while most of the short bursts are linearly dispersed along the ghirlanda lower limit .",
    "we assume a beaming factor of unity for the ghirlanda relation in the figure 2 , indicating that the opening jet angle is 90 degrees , which is consistent with previous findings from batse @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if we decrease the beaming factor ( and thus the jet opening angle ) , the ghirlanda lower limit moves towards the bulk of long bursts , and eventually all short bursts will violate the ghirlanda lower limit .",
    "this gives support to the findings that long bursts have a dispersion of jet angles from small angles on the order of a degree up to 50 degrees @xcite and short bursts have larger average jet opening angles of 40 - 90 degrees , as is supported theoretically by @xcite and observationally by @xcite .",
    "as indicated , the combination of the @xmath0fluence plane and the ghirlanda lower limit admit derived jet opening angles for grbs , since the ghirlanda lower limit appears to describe a true cutoff in the @xmath0fluence plane that is consistent among multiple instruments .",
    "we can solve the lower limit from ghirlanda s best fit equation @xcite , which was calibrated with grbs that had well - constrained jet opening angles , in terms of the beaming fraction , observed @xmath0 , and fluence ( see @xcite ) . using this tool , we can derive jet opening angles for a large number of bursts with constrained @xmath0 values and fluences . in table 1",
    "we show the reported jet opening angles for bursts from afterglow studies in our redshift sample and compare them to our derived jet opening angles .",
    "there was no data selection cut based on parameter error due to the small sample size , therefore table 1 contains a few angles with large error bars . in a number of cases ,",
    "two different angles were inferred for a single burst , sometimes in conflict with each other . it should be noted that @xcite used radio observations to constrain the physical parameters in their sample , while radio measurements were not used by @xcite or @xcite . using only the four bursts with well - constrained reported jet angles ,",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the reported angles and the derived angles is 0.8 with a probability of 0.2 that the two quantities are not correlated given the null hypothesis . encouraged by the good agreement ( within errors ) between our estimates and the reported values of jet opening angles",
    ", we can now determine the jet angle for bursts without a measured redshift .",
    "in figure 3 we show the jet opening angles for 382 grbs from the gbm spectral catalog that have @xmath0 and fluence errors less than 40% of the mean value , resulting in an error in jet opening angle of no more than 40% for 85% of our calculated values .",
    "the distribution for long grbs is extremely similar to the inferred range of opening angles from afterglow studies ( 2 - 50 degrees ) , while the short grbs cluster closer to 90 degrees .",
    "we now proceed to explore the actual amati and ghirlanda relations with our data . in figure 4",
    "we show the rest - frame @xmath8 versus the estimated isotropic energy release , @xmath6 for the gbm redshift sample .",
    "this is a direct test of the @xmath0@xmath6 relations with bursts of known redshift , however we can use the derived upper limits of the relations to help constrain the correlations . from figure 4 , we find the long bursts are loosely dispersed along the amati relation @xcite , yet a number of long bursts are situated several sigma above the amati upper limit ( dotted line ) , which implies that if the bursts follow the amati relation , their redshifts would be imaginary numbers .",
    "interestingly , the ghirlanda relation @xcitewell describes the linear dispersion of short hard grbs if a jet opening angle of 90 degrees is assumed .",
    "this lends credence to the idea that short bursts are near isotropic bursters @xcite .    using our derived jet opening angles",
    ", we can show that there is a correlation between the rest - frame @xmath0 and the total energy release in gamma - rays after correcting for collimation , @xmath9 , which is tantamount to a luminosity - distance relation .",
    "in previous attempts at such a relation , @xcite studied @xmath6 , which would seem to define a total energy budget for the explosion , but obtained a much looser correlation , and was unable to apply the relation to short grbs .",
    "@xcite , however , studied inferred @xmath9 obtained from jet opening angles deduced from broadband afterglow observations of a few grbs and found a tighter relation than @xcite ; they were still unable to fit short grbs into the relation .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of @xmath1 from the derived jet opening angles , which is wider than previous estimates @xcite at 5 orders of magnitude and appears to peak near @xmath10 erg , although this may be due to a larger sample size compared to those previous studies .",
    "for a few bursts in the redshift sample , @xmath1 surpasses the total energy limit for a proto - magnetar , which is a few@xmath11 erg @xcite and a number of other bursts would require a very high efficiency to have viable magnetar progenitors , therefore according to our results , it is doubtful that a number of grbs in our redshift sample originate from magnetar progenitors .",
    "the energy budget for neutron star mergers is in the range of a few@xmath12 erg @xcite , while theoretically collapsars could emit up to @xmath13 erg @xcite at extremely high efficiency , which is compatible with our results .    using the derived @xmath1 obtained from the clear cutoff in the @xmath0fluence plane , figure 6 shows the new relation and provides a much tighter correlation than either of the two previous relations .",
    "it also shows that short grbs are clearly not outliers after correction for the much wider beaming angle .",
    "we present the best fit power law as @xmath14 where the empirical power law was fitted to both coordinates .",
    "the power law normalization is of the same order as that found by @xcite ( 480 kev ) , but the power law index is very similar to that found by @xcite ( 0.52 ) .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is 0.91 with a probability of @xmath15 that the two quantities are not correlated given the null hypothesis .",
    "the calculated scatter around the best fit power law is about 0.1 dex for bursts with redshift @xmath16 and covering over 4 orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "we have confirmed the @xmath0/fluence energy ratio results for gbm bursts , and have shown how they can be related to two different classes of grbs .",
    "most likely the larger of the two distributions belongs primarily to the long class of bursts typically associated with low - metallicity core - collapse supernovae , while the smaller mode belongs to the short class which is believed to be associated with neutron star - neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers .",
    "the distribution of the energy ratio provides information for the determination of the rest - frame energetics , as can be seen in more detail when plotted in the @xmath0fluence plane .",
    "the hard spectral cutoff in this plane is apparent for all batse and gbm bursts , despite the fact that these were detected with two different instruments with different sensitivities and different band passes . from this",
    "we can infer the cutoff is most likely not detector dependent , and using only physical observables , we can derive one of the most important parameters of grbs , the jet opening angle , and given an observed redshift , calculate @xmath17 .",
    "previously , the jet opening angle was only inferred for a handful of bursts for which x - ray , optical , and radio measurements of the afterglow were available @xcite .",
    "even if these measurements were available , very few bursts have discernible jet breaks that denote the moment at which the relativistic ejecta slow down to the point that the observed relativistic beaming angle is the same as the actual beaming angle of the outflow @xcite . @xcite derived jet opening angles without afterglow measurements , although their derivation required the bursts to be described by the ghirlanda relation and relied on the lag - luminosity relationship @xcite to derive pseudo - redshifts , yielding an ensemble distribution of jet opening angles . from this",
    ", they postulated that bursts with softer @xmath0 have larger opening angles than bursts with harder @xmath0 . by traditional classification of grbs",
    "@xcite , the interpretation is that short hard grbs would have smaller opening angles than long soft grbs .",
    "this is , in general , contradictory to our findings .",
    "to contrast , our results show that we can reproduce jet opening angles for individual grbs that can be spectrally analyzed with prompt emission alone and does not require the estimation of pseudo - redshifts .",
    "our resulting distribution of opening angles also agrees with a current theoretical model that the beamed outflow at the rotational poles of the progenitor is produced by the rotational angular momentum , as well as the configuration of the magnetic field @xcite . in this model",
    ", the degree of collimation is related to the ratio of radius of the compact object to the radius of the accretion disk . in the case of a collapsar ,",
    "the radius of the central object is much smaller than the radius of the disk , resulting in a tightly collimated beam , while a merger model results in much less collimation since the radius of the accretion disk is on the order of the radius of the central object . due to the much larger opening angles , observations of jet breaks for most short hard grbs as well as some from the long soft class are unlikely since the estimated jet break times will be on the order of several months @xcite .    applying the jet opening angle to the redshift sample",
    ", we can estimate the entire energy outflow in gamma - rays . from our results , we can rule out a proto - magnetar progenitor for a few long grbs ( 080916c , 080810 , 090323 , 090519 , and 090902b ) as well as a short grb ( 090510 ) .",
    "when we compare this energy budget for each grb to the @xmath0 , we find a clear correlation between the energy of peak power production and the total energy output in gamma - rays .",
    "one major distinction of our relation shows that both classes of grbs can be described by the same power law fit , which has not been previously shown .",
    "the uncertainties of our calculations include geometric effects , as grbs are likely seen slightly off- axis from the center of the jet , and this error propagates through to the calculation of @xmath9 .",
    "these uncertainties will likely be small for long bursts with small opening angles , due to the small possible displacement of the viewing angle relative to the jet opening angle .",
    "this relationship may potentially be exploited to extrapolate a rough redshift distribution for grbs without redshift estimates , although a larger sample of grbs with measured redshift is desired to confirm the existence of such a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we derive the collimation - corrected gamma - ray energy , @xmath1 , for grbs with redshift and find that some of the grbs in our sample are inconsistent with a proto - magnetar progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the use of the derived jet opening angles results in a tighter correlation between the rest - frame @xmath0 and @xmath1 than has previously been presented , which places long grbs and short grbs onto one empirical power law . </S>"
