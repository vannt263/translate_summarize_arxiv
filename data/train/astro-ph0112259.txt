    "observations of lithium in the atmospheres of red giants continue to pose theoretical challenges .",
    "stars evolving up the red giant branch from the main sequence develop a deep convective envelope that dilutes the surface lithium abundance .",
    "thus , red giants are predicted to have a lithium abundance considerably below the initial or interstellar abundance of log @xmath8(li)@xmath133.0 .",
    "classical calculations ( iben 1967 ) predict a reduction by a factor of 30 and 60 for solar metallicity stars of 1  @xmath14 and 3  @xmath14 , respectively . if some lithium has been destroyed prior to evolution off the main sequence , the red giant s lithium abundance will be even further reduced . however , as a very luminous asymptotic red giant ( 4 - 7 m@xmath15 ) , theory and observations show that surface lithium can be replenished and even increased above the initial or interstellar abundance thanks to hot bottom burning in intermediate - mass stars ( sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with a red giant that has yet to evolve to the asymptotic giant branch but that has a lithium abundance greatly in excess of that expected of a star on the red giant branch .",
    "wallerstein & sneden ( 1982 ) discovered the first such red giant : hd112127 with @xmath16(li ) @xmath17 3.0 , i.e. , the interstellar value . in the last two decades",
    ", additional examples have been discovered ; charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) list 17 stars ( including 3 subgiants , 2 early - agb stars , and 2 for which evolutionary status has yet to be determined ) with @xmath16(li ) @xmath18 2.0 , and include several additional examples with a lower lithium abundance which is most probably in excess of that expected of a red giant .",
    "three of the 17 stars have a lithium abundance clearly greater than the stars probable initial value .",
    "charbonnel & balachandran ( 2000 ) lists @xmath19 values for 22 giants of which 10 have @xmath19 @xmath20 8 km s@xmath4 .",

    "it now appears that more than half of the li - rich giants are rotating at a unusually high rate for normal k giants for which average @xmath21 2.0 ( de medeiros et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this proportion drops to a mere 2% for the more common slowly rotating k giants ( drake et al .",

    "the star is iras 19285 + 0517 , also known as pds100 after the pico dos dias survey ( de la reza , drake , & da silva 1996 ) .",
    "no prior quantitative spectroscopy of this star has been reported .",
    "we show from high - resolution echelle spectra that the star is li - rich ( @xmath16(li ) @xmath17 2.5 ) and rapidly rotating ( @xmath2 @xmath17 9 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "standardized photometry was carried out for this object at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "visible photometry was made using a ccd on the 0.9 m telescope on 1995 september 13 and near - infrared observations were made using the cryogenic optical bench ( cob ) infrared camera on the 2.1 m telescope on 1995 october 12 .",

    "the visible photometry is corrected for extinction using the extinction curve computed by seaton ( 1979 ) , and the near - infrared values are corrected for extinction using the relationship between infrared and visible extinction ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",

    "an asymmetric h@xmath28 profile is common in li - rich k giants ( drake et al .",

    "standard procedures are not directly applicable here because the high rotational velocity increases the blending of lines and reduces the number of useful lines . in a modification of the standard procedure , we first determined @xmath34 and then proceed to the determination of the latter parameters .    to determine @xmath34 we chose combination of weak and strong lines of the same species and with similar lower excitation potentials ( lep ) .",

    "@xmath28 ser was included by lambert & ries ( 1981 ) in their c , n , and o analyses of a sample of field k giants .",
    "the expected changes in c and n were revealed by this analysis .",
    "relative to the mean abundances for the sample , @xmath28ser was somewhat less depleted in c and less enriched in n with an approximately normal o abundance ( table  6 ) . iras",
    "19285 + 0517 is a close but not exact match to @xmath28ser .",
    "the closeness of the match depends on whether the comparison is made using [ x / h ] or [ x / fe ] . using [ x / h ] ,",
    "the c and n abundances are very similar , possibly identical to within the errors of measurement ; @xmath28ser is slightly enriched in n and o , where the latter is presumably a reflection of a higher initial abundance . if [ x / fe ] is the preferred indicator , iras19285 + 0517 is underabundant in c , n , and o by @xmath220.14 , @xmath220.29 , and @xmath220.24 dex , respectively , relative to @xmath28ser .",
    "judged with respect to the assumption that initial abundances would have satisfied the condition [ c / fe ] = [ n / fe ] = 0 , iras 19285 + 0517 is possibly just deficient in carbon ( @xmath220.07 dex ) and enriched in nitrogen ( + 0.06 dex ) .",
    "given that a typical red giant displays larger abundance changes - [ c / fe ] @xmath17 @xmath220.2 and [ n / fe ] @xmath79 + 0.4 are typical ( lambert & ries 1981 ) - there is a suspicion that li - rich iras 19285 + 0517 has ` anomalous ' carbon and nitrogen abundances .",
    "the certain and pronounced anomalies of iras19285 + 0517 are ( i ) its high lithium abundance ( @xmath58(li ) = 2.5 ) , ( ii ) its rapid rotation ( @xmath80 km s@xmath4 ) , and ( iii ) its substantial infrared excess . in having these anomalies , iras 19285",
    "+ 0517 is similar hd233517 ( balachandran et al . 2000 ) , and pds365 ( drake et al . 2001 ) .",
    "drake et al .",
    "list the known k giants with @xmath81 km s@xmath4 . of their 22 stars ,",
    "6 of the 14 with a measured lithium abundance are li - rich . among the few k giants with a pronounced infrared excess , about half are li - rich ( de la reza et al .",
    "the impression given is that li enrichment , rapid rotation , and infrared excess are causally related . that the correlation between the three observational attributes is not perfect may be due to different times and time scales for their appearance and/or disappearance",
    "; for example , surface lithium abundance may decay as lithium is destroyed internally at a rate different from the rate at which angular momentum is removed from the envelope .",
    "an assumption common to the proposed explanations of the li - rich giants is that , as a subgiant , the star underwent the predicted severe dilution of its original lithium and the lithium was subsequently replenished at some point in the giant s evolution .",
    "this is a plausible scenario since several li - rich giants , some slowly rotating and others rapidly rotating , have a lithium abundance greater than the star s presumed initial abundance .",
    "in addition , there are no known main sequence stars with a lithium abundance that , after standard dilution by the factor of about 30 to 50 , would provide the high lithium abundance of the li - rich giants .",
    "therefore , proposed explanations envisage either lithium production by the giant or replenishment of surface lithium by capture of one or more planets .",
    "explanations should be judged for plausibility not only for the lithium abundance but also by their ability to account for the existence of circumstellar material as revealed through the infrared excess and for the rapid rotation of many li - rich giants .",
    "proposals invoking lithium production exploit the @xmath82he reservoir predicted to exist outside the he - core and , if present , the h - burning shell of the red giant .",
    "this reservoir was built up in the main sequence star outside its h - burning core in layers sufficiently hot for @xmath82he to be produced by the initial steps of the @xmath83-chain but not so hot that @xmath82he was quickly destroyed . the giant s convective envelope that diluted",
    "the surface lithium also smeared the @xmath82he reservoir over the envelope . given this supply of @xmath82he ,",
    "the reactions @xmath82he@xmath84be@xmath85li may convert @xmath82he to @xmath67li . to achieve efficient lithium production , the @xmath67be must be swept quickly to lower temperatures in order to avoid destruction of @xmath12be and @xmath12li by hot protons .",
    "this scenario of lithium production , which is commonly called the cameron - fowler ( 1971 ) mechanism , accounts for the li - rich agb stars which are predicted to have a deep convective envelope with a hot bottom .",
    "the @xmath82he reservoir has been invoked by several authors ( e.g. , sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) as the key to the li - rich giants ( i.e stars at luminosities too low for them to be identified as agb giants ) but , in many cases , the physical trigger for @xmath67li production has not been identified .",
    "palacios , charbonnel , & forestini ( 2001 ) have suggested that the burning of @xmath67li created by depletion of the @xmath82he reservoir enables lithium to get to the surface .",
    "rapid rotation is suggested as a way to generate a ` lithium flash ' to enhance the mixing and surface abundance .",
    "this process is expected to occur when the red giant s h - burning shell burns through a discontinuity in mean molecular weight introduced previously by the development of the convective envelope .",
    "a majority of the li - rich giants appear to be at the predicted luminosity ( charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ) , as estimated from their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "( the luminosity and @xmath31 are not very different from the prediction for he - core burning giants . )",
    "this interesting idea only in a more speculative fashion accounts for the infrared excess ; the luminosity increase of about a factor of 2 during the brief flash ( duration @xmath1 10@xmath82 yrs ) is blamed for the mass loss on the empirical evidence from much more luminous stars that mass loss increases with luminosity .",
    "the idea does explain why lithium is pure @xmath67li .",
    "if our suspicion is confirmed that the carbon and nitrogen abundances of iras 19285 + 0517 are less extreme than expected for a normal red giant , this would seem to present a difficulty for the li - flash scenario ; the predicted duration of the flash is too short to affect the abundances which should reflect fully the alterations induced by the convective envelope .",
    "an alternative explanation for the main anomalies ( li enrichment , rapid rotation , and circumstellar matter ) is the accretion by the red giant of material in the form of planets or a brown dwarf .",
    "this has been discussed to different degrees of detail by alexander ( 1967 ) , siess & livio ( 1999 ) and and denissenkov & weiss ( 2000 ) .",
    "siess & livio ( 1999 ) discuss the accretion of a planet or brown dwarf by 1  m@xmath56 red giants of different luminosities .",
    "it is shown that the red giant may be spun up , eject mass , and become enriched in lithium .",
    "considerable adjustments to the internal structure occur but the surface lithium enrichment results entirely from the lithium in the accreted material .",
    "if destruction of lithium is avoided , the maximum lithium abundance resulting from the accretion of giant planets or a brown dwarf is necessarily the interstellar value ( say , @xmath58(li ) @xmath86 3 ) .",
    "the lithium abundance of iras19285 + 0517 is comfortably below this limit but several li - rich stars ( charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ; drake et al .",
    "2001 ) have lithium above this limit . in principle , higher lithium abundances are possible through the accretion of terrestrial planets ( i.e. , cosmic material less hydrogen , helium , and other volatiles ) , but this requires that the mass of the material from which the terrestrial planets were derived exceeds the mass of the red giant ( brown et al .",
    "1989 ) , which would seem to be a difficult condition to meet .",
    "denissenkov & weiss ( 2000 ) propose that accretion activates the cameron - fowler mechanism and thus the surface lithium abundance may exceed the initial value before destruction sets in .",
    "in addition to accounting for the lithium , the rapid rotation , and the infrared excess , accretion of giant planets or a brown dwarf serves to adjust the c and n abundances towards their initial values and away from the changed values induced by the convective envelope . if the lithium is added without subsequent destruction , the isotopic lithium ratio would be expected to be close to the initial value for the star and its natal cloud , which , on the basis of limited evidence from measurements of the ratio in local diffuse clouds , is likely to have been about @xmath67li/@xmath66li = 10 , a ratio clearly ruled out for iras 19285 + 0517 .",
    "however , for this star , we can not exclude the possibility that a small amount of lithium was destroyed subsequent to the accretion .",
    "since @xmath66li is destroyed about 70 times faster than @xmath67li , even the loss of trace amounts of lithium ensures effectively complete destruction of @xmath66li .",
    "with the discovery of extra solar planets in close elliptical orbits , accretion of giant planets by red giants is a virtual certainty . that this phenomenon can account for all of the known li - rich giants is uncertain .",
    "accretion without activation of the @xmath87he reservoir certainly can not account for the super li - rich stars which have more li than the ism value",
    ". it would be helpful to extend the detailed analyses of the li - rich giants .",
    "extensions should include a uniform abundance analysis for the light elements ( and isotopes ) c , n , and o for a sample including normal k giants , so that subtle differences between li - rich and li - normal giants may be distinguished .",
    "extant analyses show that there are no large differences ( berdyugina & savanov 1994 ; da silva et al .",
    "measurement of the beryllium abundance in li - rich giants would be valuable .",
    "accretion of a planet or brown dwarf restores the be abundance .",
    "conversion of the @xmath87he reservoir to @xmath12li does not return the be abundance to its pre - diluted value ( castilho et al .",
    "1999 ) .    measurements of the @xmath67li/@xmath66li ratio should be extended to other stars .",
    "positive detection of @xmath11li would favor the accretion scenario . in this regard",
    ", we note the recent detection of @xmath66li in the atmosphere of a main sequence star with a giant extra solar planet ( israelian et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests that the star has accreted one or more former planets . early accretion of this kind will not account for li - rich giants like iras 19285 + 0517 , because in evolution to the red giant phase , the convective envelope will dilute the lithium to below the observed abundance of iras19285 + 0517 .",
