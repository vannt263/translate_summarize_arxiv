    "is expected to increase significantly @xcite .",
    "some experimentalists @xcite claim to have observed such enhancement of electron mobility in sinw fets . but kotlyar _ et al_. @xcite have shown that , in a cylindrical sinw , the phonon - limited mobility decreases with decreasing diameter due to an increased overlap between the electron and phonon wavefunctions .",
    "recent work also shows that surface roughness scattering ( srs ) becomes less important in ultra small sinws @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the mobility of electrons in a rectangular sinw by taking into account electron scattering due to acoustic phonons , intervalley non - polar optical phonons , and imperfections at the si - sio@xmath0 interface , and also discuss the importance of incorporating the confinement of acoustic phonons in these structures .",

    "the former results in an enhanced mobility , while the latter results in mobility degradation . the overlap integral ( [ overlapph ] ) shown in fig . [ overlapvsw ] for various widths increases with a decrease in the wire width due to an increase in the electron confinement . in narrow wires ,",

    ", width=240 ]      the srs overlap integral given by ( [ overlapsry ] ) has three terms .",
    "two are due to deformation of the wavefunction , and the third , dominant term depends on the strength of the field perpendicular to the interface .",
    "since the field normal to the side interfaces is very weak , srs due to these interfaces is much less efficient than scattering due to the top and bottom ones .",
    "the decrease in srs with decreasing wire width can be understood by following the behavior of the average distance ( [ avdisteq ] ) of the carriers from the top interface : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total line density and @xmath41 is the line density in the @xmath42 subband of the @xmath43 valley . in fig .",
    "[ avdist ] , we can see that the carriers are moving away from the top interface as the width of the wire is decreased , and are therefore not strongly influenced by the interface .",
    "this behavior is also observed in the case of ultrathin double - gate soi fets , and is due to the onset of volume inversion @xcite . as the sinw approaches the volume inversion limit ,",
