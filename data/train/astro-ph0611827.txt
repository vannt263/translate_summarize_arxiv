    "the large surveys for metal - poor stars conducted over the course of the past few decades ( e.g. , the hk survey of beers and colleagues ; beers , preston , & shectman 1985 , 1992 ; beers 1999 ) , and the hamburg / eso survey of christlieb and collaborators ( he s ; christlieb 2003 ) have revealed that a substantial fraction of very metal - poor ( vmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) stars exhibit enhanced ratios of carbon , [ c / fe ] @xmath3 ( this fraction is currently estimated to be at least 20% , see lucatello et al . 2006 ) . this frequency appears to rise with declining [ fe / h ] ; beers & christlieb ( 2005 ) point out that 40% of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 , based on high - resolution analyses , have [ c / fe ] @xmath5 + 1.0 , including the two known hyper metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath65.0 ) stars , he  0107@xmath75240 ( christlieb et al .",

    "the class of cemp - no stars comprises stars that , in spite of their large c ( and often n and o ) overabundances with respect to fe , do not exhibit strong neutron - capture elements . recently , cemp stars have also been found with large enhancements of the alpha elements ( norris , ryan , & beers 2001 ; aoki et al .",
    "2002 ; depagne et al .",
    "2002 ) , which aoki et al .",
    "( 2006b ) refer to as cemp-@xmath9 stars .",
    "the astrophysical sites of carbon production in cemp stars are the subject of much current observational and theoretical interest ( beers & christlieb 2005 ; ryan et al .",

    "the carbon in the cemp - s stars is very likely to have been produced by an intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companion that has transferred material to the presently observed star .",
    "the origin of the carbon in the other cemp classes is not yet fully understood .",
    "the cemp - no stars are of special interest , as it has been suggested that their c ( as well as their n and o ) may have been produced by a primordial population of massive ( 20 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath10 100 ) , rapidly - rotating , mega metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ) stars , which are predicted to have experienced significant mass loss ( of cno - enhanced material ) via strong winds ( hirschi et al 2006 ; meynet et al 2006 ) .",
    "aoki et al . ( 2006a ) have shown that the cemp - no stars are found preferentially at the lowest metallicities ( @xmath13 ) , while the cemp - s stars are generally found in the metallicity range @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath15 @xmath72.0 .",
    "the cemp - no stars exhibit quite low ratios ( in the range @xmath16 @xmath17 ) , indicating that a significant amount of mixing has occurred in their progenitor objects ( aoki et al .",

    "it is clear that the cemp - no stars are of fundamental importance for understanding the early evolution of elements in the galaxy .    in order to more",
    "fully test the association of cemp - no stars with massive primordial stars , and to better explore the nature of the s - process in low - metallicity agb stars , which is still rather poorly understood ( herwig 2005 ) , we require measurements of the important elements c , n , and o for as large a sample of cemp stars as possible . c and n can be measured from cemp stars based on medium - resolution optical observations of molecular ch , c@xmath18 , and cn features , while o remains a challenge , even at high spectral resolution .",
    "most previous high - resolution observations of cemp stars have relied on measurements of the o  i 7774  triplet lines , which are strongly affected by nlte effects ( e.g. , asplund 2005 ) .",
    "the most reliable oxygen abundances come from the forbidden [ oi ] 6300  line , but this feature is quite weak at low metallicities , and requires several hours of 8m - class telescope time per star in order to obtain a detection .",
    "an attractive alternative is provided by medium - resolution measurements of the strengths of the near - infrared first overtone ro - vibrational bands of co at 2.3@xmath19 . because the c abundances in cemp stars exceed the o abundances , essentially all of the o",
    "is locked up in co molecules ; these lines thus provide a sensitive probe of the o abundance .",
    "in addition , the large separation of the @xmath1co lines from the @xmath0co lines at 2.3@xmath19 provides a straightforward means to measure the important mixing diagnostic .    in this paper",

    "we fit three bandheads of co lines in the k - band ( see figure 5b ) , and also obtain a reasonably good fit for some of the cn features .",
    "it should also be noted that somewhat different model atmospheres than ours were adopted for their study .",
    "our estimate of @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 5 , based on the optical spectrum for this star ( the near - infrared spectrum of this star has quite weak co features , and is of insufficient s / n ) , agrees well with the ratio obtained by plez & cohen ( 2005 ) . our estimate of the ba abundance for g  77 - 61 , [ ba / fe ] @xmath45 , is consistent with the upper limit of [ ba / fe ] @xmath46 obtained by these same authors .      this star has been studied at high resolution in the optical by goswami et al .",
    "these authors employed atmospheric parameters = 4750  k , = 2.0 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath72.0 .",
    "their effective temperature and surface gravity estimates were set based on the excitation balance and ionization equilibrium , respectively , from on analysis of the detected fe  i and fe  ii lines in their spectrum .",
    "our estimate of effective temperature , based on the @xmath29 color ( t@xmath47 = 4560  k ) , is 200  k lower than theirs .",
    "at least half of the discrepancy between our lower metallicity estimate for this star , [ fe / h ] = @xmath43 , can be accounted for by differences in the adopted temperature .",
    "if we adopt the goswami temperature estimate instead , we obtain a metallicity estimate of [ fe / h ] @xmath48 .",
    "goswami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found this star to be enriched in pb and other s - process elements .",
    "we estimate a ba abundance from the ba  ii 4934   line of [ ba / fe ] = + 2.9 , which is 0.6 dex higher than that found by goswami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but is roughly consistent within the expected errors of our procedure ( see above ) .",
    "the cno abundance determinations , along with the and ba abundances , provide sufficient information to at least make a preliminary classification of the stars in our pilot sample .",
    "it should be kept in mind that all of our program objects , with the exception of g  77 - 61 , are giants , hence they have almost certainly undergone mixing processes that would have diluted material in the outer envelope with gas that has undergone ( at least ) cn processing .",
    "this means that the presently observed abundances of c and n , as well as the ratio , may have been altered from their values prior to undergoing mixing .",
    "any of the stars that acquired material as a result of mass transfer from an agb companion are also expected to have undergone some amount of `` evolutionary dilution '' ( lucatello et al .",
    "2006 ) , which would result in a net reduction of the cno and ba abundances they received from their companion . for the purpose of the following discussion",
    ", we have not included the ( possibly large ) effects of nlte or 3d atmospheric models on the derived abundances of the light elements ( see asplund 2005 ) .      for our program stars , [ c / fe ]",
    "always exceeds [ n / fe ] . at present",
    ", the number of stars known where [ n / fe ] exceeds [ c / fe ] is quite small ( see the discussion by johnson et al .",
    ". the [ c / n ] ratios of our program stars all fall at or below + 1.0 ; the lowest are v  ari and he  0322 - 1504 , with [ c / n ] = 0.0 and + 0.1 , respectively .",
    "these values are in the range that is often found for cemp stars ( see , e.g. , figure 6 of johnson et al .",
    "the models of agb synthesis provided by herwig ( 2004 ) indicate that , if the origin of our program stars is associated with mass transfer from very metal - poor agb stars , these progenitors would be of intermediate mass ( @xmath38 3 - 6 m@xmath49 ) .    only a small number of cemp stars have measured o abundances reported in the literature , owing to the difficulties of making this measurement , even at high - resolution , in the optical spectra of such objects .",
    "this is particularly true for the cooler stars we have considered in our pilot sample , as the low temperatures enhance the strength of the molecular bands associated with carbon .",
    "thus , it is difficult to put our present measurements into a larger context ; this will have to wait for the assembly of a sufficiently large sample of cemp stars with available o measurements in the near future .",
    "the measurements we have carried out from our near - infrared spectra demonstrate that [ o / fe ] is strongly correlated with [ c / fe ] ; see figure 6 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that expected if the envelope material has been accreted from an agb companion that has undergone third dredge - up mixing .",
    "the abundances range from a low value of [ o / fe ] = + 0.1 ( he  0534 - 4548 ) to a high of [ o / fe ] = + 1.8 ( g  77 - 61 ) .",
    "these values all fall in the range which sivarani et al .",
    "( 2006 ) associate with non hot bottom burning ( non - hbb ) , low mass ( 0.8 - 3.0 ) , vmp agb stars .",
    "the carbon isotope measurements , with the exception of the large value for v  ari (  = 90 ) and the intermediate value for he  1045 - 1434 (  = 20 ) , are all quite low ,  @xmath50 .",
    "such values are often found in cemp stars of various classes ( see the compilation in table 4 of sivarani et al .",
    "2006 ) , and may be driven primarily by the extent that mixing processes have altered the observed surface isotopic ratio .",
    "the higher measured [ c / fe ] and the intermediate for he  1045 - 1434 , as compared to the other stars studied here , indicates that less dilution and cn processing has occured during its giant - branch phase .",
    "five of the seven stars ( the exceptions being g  77 - 61 and he  0534 - 4548 ) have large [ ba / fe ] ratios , consistent with their identification as cemp - s stars .",
    "aoki et al .",
    "( 2006a ) report that 80% of their large sample of cemp stars can be classified as cemp - s , and are likely to be associated with agb mass transfer to the presently observed companion star .",
    "the cno abundances of these stars , discussed above , are consistent with origin in intermediate - mass non - hbb agb stars .",
    "the cemp - s stars include , as a subclass , the so - called lead ( pb ) stars .",
    "from the high - resolution study of he  1305 + 0007 by goswami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we are aware that this star from our program is a member of this class . high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the rest of the stars in our pilot sample will be required in order to check if there are additional members of this class in our sample .",
    "he  1305 + 0007 has also been shown by goswami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to be a cemp - r / s star , a group of stars that exhibit large enhancements of elements associated with the r - process , in addition to s - process enhancements ( see beers & christlieb 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "g  77 - 61 and he  0534 - 4548 exhibit significantly lower [ ba / fe ] than found for the cemp - s stars in our program .",
    "we only have an upper limit on the [ ba / fe ] for g  77 - 61 , so it remains possible that it satisfies the beers & christlieb ( 2005 ) definition for cemp - no stars ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath51 ) , while he  0534 - 4548 might be considered a ba - mild star , since its [ ba / fe ] is above solar ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath52 ) , but clearly lower than the [ ba / fe ] ratios of the cemp - s stars in our sample .",
    "the [ ba / fe ] ratio for this star should be confirmed by additional high - resolution spectroscopic observations . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the cemp - no stars are of particular interest , since they may be associated with massive mega metal - poor progenitors , rather than agb stars .",
    "this paper has presented an analysis of medium - resolution optical and near - infrared spectroscopy for a small number of cemp stars . we have demonstrated that this approach is capable of obtaining measurements of the critical elemental abundances needed to discriminate cemp - s stars from cemp - no stars in an efficient manner .",
    "it is our intention to obtain a greatly expanded set of near - infrared spectroscopy with the soar 4.1 m telescope for on the order of 100 cemp stars , including a larger number of stars with previous high - resolution data available , in the near future .",
    "optical medium - resolution spectroscopy for this sample is already available .",
    "the availability of [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , [ o / fe ] ,  , and [ ba / fe ] for such a large sample will provide data ( in particular for o and the ) that complements available high - resolution studies , and will also identify stars of particular interest for future inspection at high spectral resolution .",
    "the authors express gratitude to steve heathcote and bob blum for several useful observational tips , and for assistance with osiris during soar early science observations .",
