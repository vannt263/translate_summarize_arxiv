    "moreover , most pairs of 3-manifolds and spatial trivalent graphs in them admit hyperbolic structures with parabolic meridians , that is , the complements of the spatial graphs carry metrics of constant sectional curvature @xmath4 which complete to manifolds with non - compact geodesic boundary having toric cusps at the knot components of the graph , annular cusps at the meridians of the edges , and geodesic 3-punctured boundary spheres at the vertices , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "two handlebody - knots are said to be equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an ambient isotopy of the 3-manifold .",
    "handlebody - knot theory is another natural generalization of the classical knot theory , since a regular neighborhood of a knot determines a genus one handlebody - knot in a 3-manifold .",
    "a handlebody - knot also naturally appears in the theory of 3-manifolds , since every closed orientable 3-manifold admits a decomposition into two handlebodies called a heegaard splitting and such handlebodies can be regarded as simplest handlebody - knots in the 3-manifold .",
    "moreover , such an object appears in the theory of hyperbolic structures with geodesic boundary , finiteness properties of invariants of 3-manifolds , etc .",

    "the best general reference here is the introduction of @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that finding a generating set of the symmetry groups of the unknotted handlebodies are very important for both the theory of handlebody - knots and that of heegaard splittings .",

    "we then conclude in theorem [ thm : symmetry group of reducible handlebody - knots of genus two ] that the symmetry groups of reducible handlebody - knots of genus two are finitely presented due to the bass - serre theory of groups acting on graphs .",
