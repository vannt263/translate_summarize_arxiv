    "around 10% of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are strong sources of radio emission .",
    "this includes radio galaxies , radio quasars ( flat or steep spectrum ) , and bl lac type objects .",
    "all these sources are generally referred to as radio loud ( rl ) agn , whereas flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lac objects are collectively known as _",
    "blazars_. interestingly ,",
    "the vast majority of identified extragalactic sources in the third egret catalog ( 3eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) belong to the blazar class .",
    "rl agn , and blazars in particular , are the most numerous and most luminous class of extragalactic gamma - ray sources . that these sources are bright in both gamma - ray and radio suggests a connection between the emission processes in the two energy bands .",
    "radio emission from blazars ( and rl agn in general ) is generally accepted to be synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons , while the physical processes responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission are much less well constrained .",
    "the presence of non - thermal synchrotron emission implies the existence of a population of relativistic electrons . in the presence of low energy seed photons and relativistic beaming , inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of the photons",
    "is frequently invoked to explain the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "indeed , in the well known _",
    "blazar sequence _",
    "@xcite , it is proposed that the synchrotron and inverse compton mechanisms give rise to a connection between the radio luminosity and the peak frequencies and relative intensities of the characteristic two - humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars . on the other hand ,",
    "evidence for a direct correlation between radio and @xmath0-ray flux density or luminosity has been widely debated since the egret era ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ , with its large field of view and unprecedented sensitivity , is now putting us in the condition of a better understanding of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray source population .",
    "in anticipation of the launch of _ fermi _ , large projects in the radio band have been undertaken ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "can now be exploited to gain insights into the radio properties of this population ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and into the relation between radio and gamma - ray properties .    in the present paper , we report in  [ s.1 ] the main results obtained after three months of sky - survey operation ( lat bright agn sample , lbas , *",
    "* ) and in  [ s.2 ] some analysis of an expanded source set based on a preliminary version of the 1 year catalog .",

    "we use a @xmath4cdm cosmology with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the hubble constant @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and define radio spectral indices @xmath10 such that the flux density @xmath11 .",
    "in the first three months of sky - survey operation , the lat has revealed 125 non - pulsar bright sources at @xmath12 with test statistic greater than 100 ( @xmath13 , corresponding to a detection significance of @xmath14 ) ; 106 of these sources have high - confidence associations with known agn , 10 have lower - confidence associations , and only 9 remain unassociated .",
    "therefore , considering both high- and lower - confidence associations , the fraction of high - latitude bright @xmath0-ray sources associated with radio loud agn is as high as 93% . while egret results suggested that rl agn would dominate this population , this degree of dominance is nonetheless amazing .",
    "more than 50% ( 96/181 ) of the high - latitude ( @xmath12 ) sources in the 3eg catalog were unassociated and it seems that the overwhelming majority of those were rl agn !",

    "of the 106 lbas sources , 104 are blazars , consisting of 58 fsrqs ( including one narrow - line seyfert  1 , j0948 + 0022 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; 42 bl lacs ; four blazars with unknown classification ; and two radio galaxies ( centaurus a and ngc 1275 ) .",
    "the basic radio properties can be obtained from the radio catalogs used for the associations , i.e.  crates @xcite and bzcat @xcite .",
    "crates provides 8.4 ghz vla data for sources brighter than @xmath16mjy , typically with subarcsecond resolution .",
    "bzcat is a multi - frequency catalog giving low frequency radio data , typically from the nvss .",
    "not surprisingly , given the flux and spectral selection criteria of the samples , the lbas sources are relatively bright ( @xmath17 have @xmath18mjy ) and have flat spectral index ( @xmath19 ) , which are typical signatures of compact self - absorbed components .",

    "[ f.1 ] ) clearly reflects the flatness of the spectral index , with all the points ( but one ) close to the @xmath15 line ; the outlying point represents cena , the only source with a significant amount of extended radio emission dominating the low frequency flux density . in the luminosity plot ( fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ) , the common dependence on the square of the distance stretches the distribution even more . here",
    ", the interesting result is the relative distribution of the lbas sources with respect to a complete sample of radio galaxies ( dashed line , from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : except cena ( which lies near the radio galaxy region ) , all cores of lbas sources are more luminous when compared to radio galaxies of the same extended luminosity , which can be accounted for by a large doppler factor for the radio cores of @xmath0-ray sources",
    ". moreover , the low frequency luminosity ( generally taken as a measure of the extended , optically thin emission ) is contaminated by the nuclear emission for lbas sources , so that the actual extended emission luminosity would be lower than the observed @xmath20 ( corresponding to a shift of the points in the direction of the parallel arrows in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ) .",
    "the two main consequences are as follows : ( 1 ) the doppler beaming effect can actually be larger than apparent from the figure and ( 2 ) @xmath0-ray sources can be found even in blazars with extended emission as low as @xmath21whz@xmath9 .      in terms of the radio luminosity @xmath22 ( calculated at @xmath23ghz ) , the sources in the present sample with a measured redshift span the range @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "bl lacs and fsrqs are not uniformly distributed in this interval : the former span a broad range of radio luminosities ( @xmath26 = 42.8\\pm1.2 $ ] ) while the latter are more clustered at high radio luminosity ( @xmath27 = 44.4\\pm0.6 $ ] ) .",
    "blazars of unknown type have low - s / n optical spectra , so a redshift is generally not available and their radio luminosities are not determined .",
    "of the two radio galaxies associated with objects in the lbas , ngc  1275 is similar to the bl lacs ( @xmath28 erg s@xmath9 ) , while cen  a lies at the very low end of the radio power distribution ( @xmath29 erg s@xmath9 ) .",

    "[ f.3 ] ) of the 106 objects yields @xmath31 .",
    "however , the actual significance of this result can not be assessed without monte carlo simulations , since biases and/or selection effects modify the distribution of @xmath30 from the ideal case . moreover , when fsrqs and bl lacs are considered separately , quite different results are obtained ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , so that it is not possible to claim significant correlations at this stage .",
    "furthermore , the radio and @xmath0-ray data are not simultaneous .",
    "the importance of this effect needs to be taken into account , and the only method to address its impact is to apply similar tests to a simultaneous sample , such as the one provided from the f - gamma ( ovro 15 ghz , effelsberg & iram 30 m 2 - 230 ghz ) monitoring programs .",

    "the other relevant plot for the comparison of radio and @xmath0-ray properties is the radio luminosity vs.  @xmath0-ray spectral index plane ( see fig .",

    "preliminary histogram of radio spectral index distribution for agn associated with lat sources in the 1-yr catalog . ]    with the continuation of the lat operation in sky - survey mode , the number of detected blazars is bound to increase . in the 1-year catalog under development from the lat team , more than 1000 sources have been detected and characterized @xcite .",
    "in particular , the _ large field of view _ of the lat has allowed us to reach weak gamma - ray sources all over the sky and the search for their possible radio counterparts has required a huge amount of work ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indeed , while the lbas results were based on sources with @xmath13 in three months of survey , the 1-year preliminary results presented here are based on sources with @xmath36 ( significance about @xmath37 ) .",
    "as long as there is a significant overlap with the lbas , the total number of sources available for analysis becomes several times as large , and the explored space of parameters is also larger . thanks to the _ great sensitivity _ and _ broad energy range _ of the lat , _ fermi _ has already been successful in revealing faint @xmath0-ray sources and in the characterization of their diverse photon indices .",
    "it is therefore interesting to have a preliminary look at the topics discussed in the previous section using the 1-year database .",
    "the total radio luminosity range of the associated sources spans seven orders of magnitude ; the overall distribution remains similar to that found for the lbas sources .",
    "also the different distributions of fsrqs and bl lacs are confirmed , with @xmath27 = 44.2\\pm0.7 $ ] and @xmath26 = 42.2\\pm1.2 $ ] ( fig .  [ f.5 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the bl lacs remain spread over a wider interval of radio luminosities , even with a hint of bimodality ( note however that the counts are smaller for the bl lacs since their redshift is generally more difficult to determine ) .",
    "as far as the spectral properties are concerned , we show in fig .",
    "[ f.6 ] the distribution of the associations in the high vs.  low frequency radio flux density and in fig .",
    "[ f.7 ] the corresponding histogram of the spectral index distribution .",
    "it is readily apparent from both plots that the vast majority of sources have a flat spectrum ( @xmath38 ) , including sources as weak as a few tens of mjy .",
    "however , a small but significant tail of steeper spectrum sources is also present , which are described in more detail in dedicated works , such as m87 @xcite and cena @xcite , as well as in the review by @xcite .",
    "finally , the radio flux density vs.  mean @xmath0-ray flux plane becomes more populated , as shown in fig .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the full sample changes to @xmath39 .",
    "of course , the remarks noted above still apply : different source classes sample different regions of the plane , data are not simultaneous , and observational biases could be present .",
    "a more rigorous analysis is therefore necessary to claim the significance and to discuss the physical implication of the observed distribution . this will be the subject of a dedicated paper [ abdo et al .",
    ", in preparation ] .",
    "thanks to its unique capabilities , _ fermi _ has revealed that the bright gamma - ray extragalactic sky is dominated by radio loud agn , and blazars in particular , even more than it could be probed during the egret era .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-ray data from the lat , as well as the radio data from large ongoing projects , represent a great resource to constrain the physical processes related to ejection phenomena in agn .",
    "the preliminary analysis presented in this work certainly needs a more detailed follow - up , although the fraction and type of associated sources , the ranges of their core and extended radio luminosity , and the distribution of the sources in the various radio@xmath0-ray planes look already quite interesting .    in particular",
    ", the discussion of variability and the use of simultaneous data , the comparison to radio data at higher frequencies @xcite and/or resolution @xcite , and a deeper analysis with monte carlo simulations are necessary before significant claims can be made .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to remind that as we discover weaker @xmath0-ray sources , we will need to broaden our constraints on possible counterparts , including radio - faint bl lacs ( hbls ) , steep spectrum radio sources , and seyfert galaxies .",
