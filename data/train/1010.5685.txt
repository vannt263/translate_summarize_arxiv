    "intrinsic shapes of the individual elliptical galaxies have been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors have used the kinematical data and the photometric data , and have used the triaxial models with the density distribution @xmath4 , where @xmath5 with axial ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here , @xmath8 are the usual cartesian co - ordinates , oriented such that @xmath9-axis ( @xmath10-axis ) lies along the longest ( the shortest ) axis of the model .",
    "it was shown analytically that the projected density of such a distribution @xmath11 with constant @xmath12 is stratified on similar and co - aligned ellipses @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses ( apart from the kinematical data ) a constant value of ellipticity , which is an average over a suitably chosen range of radial distance , for the shape estimates .",
    "the shape estimates are robust , and are described by a pair of the shape parameters , namely the short to long axial ratio @xmath13 of the light distribution and the triaxiality @xmath14 of the mass distribution .",
    "a complementary problem was attempted by ( @xcite , hereafter @xmath15 ) , wherein variation in the intrinsic shapes of the light distribution of elliptical galaxies was investigated by using triaxial models , which exhibit ellipticity variation and position angle twist .",
    "these models are fixed by assigning the values of axial ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 at small and at large radii , respectively .",
    "these axial ratios are related to triaxialities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , at small and large radii .",
    "we use bayesian statistics , and obtain the variation in the shape , following the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "we find that the marginal posterior density @xmath20 is likelihood dominated , so that it relatively insensitive to the unknown prior density .",
    "we use a flat prior .",
    "we use a large ensemble of models , so that the shape estimates may be model independent .",
    "the basic ingredients of our method are the same as in @xcite , and we adopt all the necessary alterations described in @xmath15 .",
    "we use @xmath21 as the shape parameters and use the ellipticities @xmath22 and the position angle difference @xmath23 at two suitably chosen points @xmath24 and @xmath25 from the profiles of the photometric data of the galaxies .",
    "we find that the best constrained shape parameters are @xmath26 and the absolute value of the triaxiality difference @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath15 have estimated the shapes of @xmath29 elliptical galaxies which are comparatively rounder , with ellipticities @xmath30 .",
    "we now investigate shapes of three more galaxies , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these are very flat galaxies with ellipticity around @xmath2 or more .",
    "we find that the expectation values of the short to long axial ratio of these galaxies are around @xmath3 .",
    "we use triaxial models which are very flat .",
    "we take models with the lower limit of @xmath31 for our shape investigation .",
    "we find that a class of very flat triaxial models develops several undesirable features ( sect . 2 and appendix a ) , and are not employed in the present shape estimates .",
    "determination of the intrinsic shape using photometry is important because the number of galaxies with good photometric is many more than those with good kinematics . besides",
    ", the results obtained by alternative models and techniques can be used for a comparison .",
    "photometry constrains the flattening @xmath32 but can not constrain @xmath33 .",
    "thus , our work is complementary and not contradictory to that of statler and his coworkers .",
    "2 presents the models .",
    "the necessity for the choice of small values of the lower limits of @xmath32 , and the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies are presented in sect .",
    "4 is devoted to results and a discussion .",
    "we use models , which are triaxial generalizations of the spherical @xmath34 models of @xcite , with density @xmath35 given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the model , @xmath38 is the radial coordinate , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the scale length .",
    "the models have cusp at the centre , and the density decreases as @xmath41 at large radii .",
    "dehnen s models are the generalization of the well studied models of @xcite and @xcite , corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the projected surface density of the model of dehnen , corresponding to @xmath44 , most closely resembles to the de vaucouleurs @xmath45 law .",
    "presently , we concentrate to @xmath44 models only .",
    "a triaxial generalization of @xmath46 is presented in @xcite , which is modified in @xmath15 .",
    "the model is the density distribution of the same form as ( 1 ) with @xmath38 replaced by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 with varying axial ratios @xmath49 and @xmath50 the axial ratios @xmath51 reduce to @xmath52 at small radii and to @xmath53 at large radii .",
    "@xmath54 is a parameter , which for a choice of @xmath55 alters @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the intermediate region .",
    "the models are fixed , once the axial ratios @xmath58 are chosen .",
    "the triaxialities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related to the axial ratios at small and at large radii by @xmath59 to fix up the scale length @xmath40 of the triaxial models , we consider @xmath44 and use the value of the effective radius @xmath60 of the spherical model .",
    "the effective radius of the triaxial models depends on the axial ratios , as well as on the viewing angles . however , such changes are small for @xmath61 models @xcite , and are neglected .",
    "the constant @xmath35 surfaces are coaxial ellipsoids .",
    "projection of these models on a plane perpendicular to a line of sight , and therefore , the calculation of ellipticity and position angle are performed numerically .",
    "we refer to these models as @xmath62 models .",
    "another form of triaxial generalization of @xmath46 is investigated by @xcite , where two more terms are added to equation @xmath46 , each one of these is a suitable radial function multiplied by spherical harmonics of low order .",
    "the models provide simple analytical representation of the observed surface brightness of triaxial elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , for large values of flattening models become peanut shaped and are not used in the present investigation . very flat de",
    "zeeuw - carollo models are discussed in appendix a.",
    "the galaxies chosen here are very flat .",
    "the morphological classification of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath1 are @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , from @xmath67 @xcite catalogue .",
    "the apparent flattening of a elliptical galaxy depends on the intrinsic flattening and the orientation .",
    "further , the marginal posterior density @xmath20 @xmath68 of the bayesian estimate is obtained by integrating the posterior density over all viewing angles . to gain some insight into the possible values of the intrinsic shape , which will be obtained by bayesian method",
    ", we perform the following numerical experiments .",
    "the objective of these experiments is to find suitable limits of the axial ratios @xmath32 for the plots of @xmath68 . in the plots of @xmath68 in @xmath15 , @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "extend from @xmath3 to @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite chooses @xmath72 .",
    "1 shows the plot between the number @xmath73 of viewing angles @xmath74 and the axial ratio @xmath7 which gives ellipticity @xmath75 ( plot 1a ) and @xmath76 ( plot 1b ) .",
    "the number of viewing angles is counted between @xmath77 and @xmath78 at the interval of @xmath79 , both for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the total number of viewing angles in this numerical experiment is @xmath82 .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath6 is taken as @xmath83 . here",
    ", we use stark model .",
    "we find that a higher values of ellipticity is produced by flatter models and a lower values of ellipticity is produced by rounder models , over a larger number of viewing angles .",
    "therefore , the bayesian estimate should pick up a flat model to represent shape of the galaxies of our present investigation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the plots @xmath84 show a maxima , which lies at @xmath85 for the plot @xmath86 and at @xmath87 for the plot @xmath88    the fig .",
    "1 and its inferences are based on applying stark model , which has constant values of the axial ratio @xmath89",
    ". however , in our shape estimates , we use models with varying axial ratios .",
    "so , we re - examine the results of these plots by considering @xmath62 models .    , which would reproduce ellipticity in a chosen interval .",

    "the probability of the shape is plotted in dark grey shade : darker is the shade , higher is the probability .",
    "the white contour encloses the region of @xmath94 highest posterior density ( hpd ) , which may be interpreted as @xmath95 error bar .",
    "this figure indicates that higher probability region is confined , approximately between @xmath2 to @xmath96 of @xmath32 .",
    "hence , it is more appropriate to choose the lower and the upper limits of both @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath2 and @xmath96 for the shape estimates of very flat galaxies .",

    "the observed data of @xmath63 , is taken from r - band surface photometry of @xcite .",

    "the position angle decreases by @xmath111 .",
    "we consider the uncertainty in the ellipticity as @xmath112 and in the position angle is @xmath79 , both at @xmath24 and at @xmath25 .",
    "these are the typical errors in observations @xcite .",
    "the effective radius of the galaxy is @xmath113 arcsec .",
    "we use the ensemble of models , as described in sect .",
    "2 , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . taking the sum of the marginal posterior density over all possible values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and taking the unweighted sum over all the models , we obtain shape estimate @xmath68 as a function of @xmath32 .     as a function of @xmath90 , for ngc 720 using the limits @xmath3 to @xmath116 both for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "4 presents the shape estimate @xmath68 @xmath32 of @xmath63 , wherein we have allowed the limits @xmath3 to @xmath116 both for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we find that the @xmath95 region is very narrow which should be the consequence of the choice of the limits of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "examining this limit in fig . 1 , we find that this choice falls in the region where high values of the ellipticity will not be reproduced .",
    "therefore , we need to go to smaller values of @xmath32 to obtain higher ellipticities , which may be close to observed ellipticities of @xmath63 .    fig .",
    "5 presents shape @xmath68 @xmath32 wherein we have allowed the limits @xmath2 and @xmath96 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath95 region is wider now ( but narrow enough to satisfy the requirement of the likelihood dominated shape estimate ) . although , it is the plot of @xmath120 @xmath121 as a function of shape parameters , which constitute the bayesian estimate of the shape , some statistical summary of the shape is very convenient for its description .",
    "the expectation values @xmath122 and location of the peak values @xmath123 are such quantities .",

    "the expectation values of the flattening at small and at large radii are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "both in fig . 4 and 5 , we choose the interval between higher and lower limits of @xmath32 as @xmath3 .",
    "this is basically to save the computer time , but maintaining the reliability of the results .",
    "shape calculation requires a very large number of projections , which need to be calculated numerically .",
    "we divide the parameter space of @xmath32 in @xmath126 square bins of equal size and calculate the likelihood at the centre of each bin .",
    "the bin size is small enough , so that the calculated likelihood can be regarded as a continuum function of @xmath32 , and at the same time , the number of bins is small enough , so that the computer time is not unmanageable .    fig .",
    "6 shows the 3-dimensional intrinsic shape of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath119 .",

    "the value of @xmath119 is constant in each section , and is shown in the plot .",
    "we find that the @xmath95 region occupies larger area in the sections with smaller values of @xmath119 .",
    "further , in each section of constant @xmath119 , @xmath95 region occupies a small area of @xmath32 plane .",

    "we have presented the intrinsic shapes of 3 very flat galaxies .",
    "a specific feature of these estimates is the choice of the lower limit of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the lower limit was chosen as @xmath3 by @xmath15 and as @xmath132 by @xcite in their investigation of galaxies which are comparatively rounder , without mentioning any specific reason for this choice . through the plots of fig . 1 , and the detail discussion of the plots of @xmath68 for @xmath133 , we justified the choice of very small values of @xmath32 as their lower limits for very flat elliptical galaxies .",
