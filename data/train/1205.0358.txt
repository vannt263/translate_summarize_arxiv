    "the last image shows the final instability of the viscoelastic thread when many small droplets are formed . ]",
    "extensional flow is of primary interest for the characterization of polymers because elastic stresses can build up that are orders of magnitude larger compared to simple shear flow .",
    "the experimental determination of the elongational viscosity is still a challenging task and the characterization of this cylindrical thread is one of the rare reliable methods to extract at least some information on the elongational properties of polymer solutions .",
    "this experimental setup is also referred to as caber ( capillary break - up extensional rheometer ) and a commercial version is available as well . in spite of numerous experimental and theoretical investigations",
    ", there is still no complete understanding of the capillary break - up process @xcite .",
    "most theories indeed predict an exponential thinning of the cylindrical thread @xcite , but the determination of the correct time scales remains an open issue @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the elongational viscosity can be only deduced once a parallel filament has formed , but at this moment in time , the polymers have already accumulated a considerable amount of stress , and it is not clear how the transition from the primary thinning to the cylindrical filament shall be described .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that there is a thin layer of large stress near the free surface of the thinning capillary bridge , while our experiments show the existence of a small layer with flow close to the free surface or no flow at all in the inner parts of the cylinder near the stagnation point where the flow is mostly elongational .",
    "experimental observations also show that the flow becomes very inhomogeneous at the final stage of the thinning process where the filament becomes unstable to the formation of secondary droplets and even some flow - induced phase separation has been reported @xcite .",
    "however , our measurements show that in the intermediate regime , the flow indeed is purely elongational , and the only irregularity is the movement of the stagnation point .",
    "the experimental characterization of the flow field in a thinning capillary bridge implies certain difficulties due to the small sizes that even change in time and the optical aberrations due to the cylindrical form of the filament . in microscopic flows ,",
    "fluorescent particles are often used to visualize the flow .",
    "even if they are illuminated along the optical axes , the exiting light can be filtered before the camera , and only the fluorescence signal is observed that leads to a good contrast .",
    "the small sizes allow the use of microscopic objectives with a large numerical aperture .",
    "the desired plane of observation is determined by the field of depth , and there is no need to shape the incident light beam , e.g. , in the form of a sheet @xcite .",
    "the classical rayleigh - plateau instability describes the instability of a cylinder of infinite length , but the theoretical growth rate has been found to be in very good agreement with experimental data from a capillary thinning bridge @xcite . for an infinite thread , the instability evolves spatially in the form of a sinusoidal deformation , and for a short capillary bridge , the necking evolves in a symmetric manner . in the middle of the necking capillary bridge",
    ", a stagnation point is formed around which the flow is elongational .",
    "this elongational flow is very efficient in stretching the polymers , and when the flow rate times the polymer relaxation time , i.e. the weissenberg number , is @xmath3 , the polymers intervene the flow .",
    "for such a flow , the oldroyd - b model predicts a temporal evolution of the minimum filament diameter in the form : @xmath4 @xmath5 is the diameter of the filament at the point when exponential thinning starts , and @xmath6 is the polymeric relaxation time . the elongational viscosity can be deduced from the measurement of @xmath7 by the force balance of the capillary pressure and the polymeric stress .",
    "it follows that    @xmath8    @xmath9 is the elongation rate , and @xmath10 the surface tension .",
    "a pure elongational flow in cylinder coordinates is defined by a velocity in axial direction and in radial direction in the form @xmath11 and @xmath12    @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the axial and the radial position on the filament , respectively .",
    "thus , the elongational rate can be determined by simply measuring the diameter @xmath7 of the filament @xmath15    together with equ .",
    "[ filament_polymer ] one finally gets an elongation rate which is constant in time : @xmath16    the exponential regime might last until the polymers are fully elongated . when the polymers inside the filament are completely stretched , the liquid might behave as a newtonian fluid , but with a strongly increased viscosity .",
    "in this regime , the diameter of the filament is supposed to decrease linearly in time according to the self similarity solutions for viscous liquids @xcite .",
    "the polymer in our study was polyethyleneoxide ( peo ) with a molecular weight of @xmath17 g / mol ( sigma - aldrich , munich , germany ) .",
    "peo is a highly flexible polymer that has often been investigated in elongational measurements @xcite .",
    "the polymer was dissolved in a @xmath18-weight percent glycerol - water solution at a concentration of @xmath19 weight percent , and the overlap concentration was @xmath20 weight percent .",
    "both the semidilute concentration @xcite and the viscosity of the solvent were chosen such that the characteristic time scales were slow enough to allow for a quantitative measurement of the flow profile . in general glycerol",
    "is hygroscopic , but this is only relevant at very concentrated glycerol solutions .",
    "the solution was prepared with the following protocol : the polymer was slowly poured in water first .",
    "after some minutes of swelling at rest , the polymer - water mixture was gently stirred for 24 hours .",
    "after that , the glycerol was added , and the solution was stirred gently again for 24 hours .",
    "the solution was measured within a few hours after preparation to minimize degradation of the polymers .",
    "this protocol lead to very reproducible results that were in agreement with data from the literature @xcite .",
    "for the piv and ptv measurements , a small amount of fluorescent particles ( 0.6 @xmath21 ) was added to the solution just before the measurement .",
    "the tracer particles had a diameter of 3@xmath0 m , and their absorption maximum was at a wavelength of 530 nm while the emission maximum was at 630 nm .",
    "the samples were characterized with a thermo haake mars rheometer using cone plate geometries .",
    "the viscosity at a shear rate of @xmath22 was @xmath23 , and shear thinning was present up to a shear rate of @xmath24 with @xmath25 . above this shear rate ,",
    "the fluid became unstable to a viscoelastic instability .",
    "the surface tension of the solvent was @xmath26 and its density @xmath27 .",
    "the addition of the polymer did not change the surface tension within the measurement resolution of the pendant drop method @xmath28 .",
    "we should not expect that additional marangoni stresses at the free surface of the viscoelastic filament affect the flow because the heat absorption of the laser was very low ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we also tried to work with less concentrated or less viscous solutions but the dynamic was always to fast to allow for a quantitative piv analysis .",
    "our self - built capillary breakup extensional rheometer ( caber ) consisted of two circular stainless steel plates with a diameter of 2 mm .",
    "a droplet of the polymer solution was put between the two plates .",
    "the upper plate was then moved away slowly with a speed of 0.05mm / s by a linear motor that was controlled by a pc .",
    "when the distance of the two plates overcame the critical length for rayleigh - plateau instability , the capillary bridge started to thin .",
    "this experimental protocol differs from the standard procedure where a steep step is performed to separate the plates and to introduce a kind of well - defined pre - stretch but similar to the slow retraction method presented in ref .",
    "we find that our protocol is first more closely related to the more interesting case of a capillary bridge that thins due the rayleigh - plateau instability , and second , we find that the thinning of the filament is much more stable , e.g. , there are less oscillations in the filament that disturb the piv - measurements significantly . for the simple shadowgraph measurements ( cf .",
    "figure [ peo_beispiel ] ) , the thinning bridge was filmed with a high - speed camera that was equipped with a microscope objective with @xmath30 magnification .",
    "for the flow visualization measurements , the fluorescent tracer particles in the solution could be illuminated either with a continuous nd : yag laser ( @xmath31=532 nm , @xmath32250mw ) or with a pulsed nd : ylf laser ( @xmath31=527 nm , @xmath3216w ) .",
    "we chose a transmission geometry , and the part of the laser light that was not diffracted by the filament passed through the sample before entering the @xmath33 magnification microscope objective with an numerical aperture of @xmath34 ( fig.[transmission ] ) .",
    "a filter cube that was located between the objective and the tube lens ( see fig . [ transmission ] ) contained a 605/55 nm band - pass filter that protected the camera chip from the laser radiation , but let pass the fluorescent light .        .",
    "]    due to the cylindrical shape of the filament , the image of the fluorescent tracer particles is distorted .",
    "we only measured in the middle plane of the filament , and the effect can be visualized with a half - cylinder lens .",
    "figure [ zylinderlinse ] shows a half cylinder lens lying on a sheet of millimeter paper . plotting the radial positions of the lines recorded via a cylindrical lens versus those without a lens , one gets a straight line , at least if one is not too close to the radius r. this is in good agreement with a theoretical consideration based on simple geometrical optics .",
    "a point source at a distance @xmath35 from the center of the lens perpendicular to the optical axes seems to be shifted by a length @xmath36 that is given by    @xmath37    @xmath38 is the refractive index of the cylinder lens .",
    "[ deltax ] predicts a close to linear dependency of @xmath39 if x is smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "this relation allows for a simple correction of the geometrical aberrations .",
    "however , we were still limited to the regime in which the parallel filament already had been formed . before the formation of the parallel filament , there is an additional curvature in the direction of the longitudinal axes that is more difficult to correct for .    in the course of thinning of the filament , the number of observable particles was not constant , and we had to start with a comparably high concentration of particles of 0.6 weight percent .",
    "a piv analysis was only possible at the beginning of the thinning process . during the breakup , the number of observable particles decreased , and a ptv analysis was more reasonable from the moment when single particles were distinguishable .",

    "@xcite used @xmath0piv as well as ptv to characterize the flow profile at the intersection of a cross - channel .",
    "their measurements showed that the two techniques provide the same results .",
    "this was also confirmed by simulations and is in accordance with our findings .",
    "the images were captured at a rate of up to @xmath41 hz and afterwards analyzed by the matpiv algorithm @xcite . in our measurement , a long but thin filament was investigated , and the interrogation window width was set to 16 pixels in the radial direction and 64 pixels in the axial direction .",
    "the overlap of the windows was 50@xmath42 for both directions .",

    "the interface between the areas with and without particles moves in the radial direction because the filament thins in time .",
    "this movement might lead to spurious velocity vectors in the analysis such that non - vanishing velocity components outside the filament can appear that have to be sorted out manually or by appropriate filtering . for the ptv analysis the centroid algorithm from lab - view ( national instruments , austin , texas ) was used .",
    "the smallest capillary threads that were evaluated had a diameter of @xmath46 and the concentration of the microbeads were low enough to not expect any alteration of the flow due their presence , similar to what is found in standard microfluidic experiments @xcite .",

    "the axial velocities are still small , but the flow has changed its direction between 20 and 30ms after the beginning of the measurement . this is because the neutral ( stagnation ) point has moved upwards as well , and the stationary measurement level is first below and then above the stagnation point .     at the beginning of the measurement between t=10ms and 30ms . in this time interval , the filament diameter changes from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . ]",
    "an inhomogeneity in the flow profile along the r - axes could be explained by at least two different mechanisms .",
    "first , the amount of stretch at the boundary is largest due to the larger deformations compared to the center of the filament .",
    "this should lead to a stress layer near the boundary .",
    "this seems to be indeed the case in some numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation might be that the flow close to the center and the stagnation point is closer to a pure elongational flow that is more efficient in stretching the polymers and causes a larger elastic stress that suppresses any flow",
    ". this could be closely related to what is known from stagnation point flow and is referred to as the `` birefringent strand '' @xcite .",
    "it refers to a region of high birefringence ( and thus high elastic stress ) along the center line close to a stagnation point .     between 10ms and 250ms with a time - lag of 30ms .",
    "in this time interval the thickness of the filament changes from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . ]    with increasing time , this profile changes qualitatively ( fig .",
    "[ piv - profile_gesamt3d ] ) .",
    "the maximum of the axial velocity increases from 0.1 mm / s up to about 3.5mm / s and then remains constant .",
    "moreover , the spatial inhomogeneous profile with some flow at the edge and no flow in the middle of the filament that has formed at the beginning ( cf . fig .",
    "[ piv_anfang ] ) is conserved only for some time .",
    "first , the profile grows until the velocity at the edge has reached a value of about 2.5 mm / s .",
    "then , the expected flow with a nearly constant velocity for all radial positions at a fixed axial position is formed such that the flow `` grows '' continuously into the center of the filament ( fig .",
    "[ piv - profile_ausschnitt ] ) .",
    "this growth occurs in a manner that is not fully symmetric , but rather growth from one side is preferred .",
    "the change from a zero velocity to the finite maximum value at a position @xmath14 next to the transition from no - flow to flow occurs in a short time interval , i.e. , within the 6.5 ms measurement resolution .",
    "this could compared to the time scale of viscous diffusion , which is even much shorter considering the high extensional viscosity present here @xmath57 .",
    "the complete transition from the inhomogeneous profile lasts approximately 20 ms after the boundary velocity has reached its maximum at @xmath58 after the beginning of the measurement .",

    "<S> the cylindrical shape of the filament introduced strong optical abberations that could be corrected for , and we were able to characterize the flow in filaments with a thickness ranging from 150 to 30 @xmath0 m . in the first regime when the filament was still sufficiently large , we used a piv algorithm to deduce the flow field . at later stages when the number of particles in the observation plane decreased a ptv algorithm was used . </S>",
    "<S> the main two results of our measurements are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the flow profile at the formation of the cylindrical filament is highly inhomogeneous and there is only flow in the outer parts of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> second , we find that in most parts of the regime , where the temporal radius of the thinning filament can be fitted with an exponential law the flow indeed is purely extensional . </S>"
