    "amorphous carbon ( a - c ) exists in an amazing variety of forms with microstructures and physical properties that depend sensitively on preparation method @xcite . because a - c thin films are often used as protective coatings , the most thoroughly studied of these structure - property relationships are the dependence of the mechanical properties , e.g. , elastic constants and hardness , on deposition conditions , atomic density , and hydrogen content .",
    "the focus of our experimental study , thermal conductivity , like the mechanical properties , derives from the bonding and geometry of the atomic lattice .",
    "the large variability of microstructures within this single class of materials provides a unique opportunity for exploring heat transport in disordered solids @xcite and the applicability of the minimum thermal conductivity @xcite to materials with heterogeneous microstructures that are common in thin films @xcite .",
    "but we also anticipate that these new data will provide valuable insights on the high and low conductivities that can be produced in thin film a - c for applications in the thermal engineering of micro - devices @xcite .",
    "the concept of a `` minimum thermal conductivity '' @xmath6 is based on a theory of heat transport originally proposed by einstein @xcite : the atomic vibrations are assumed to be incoherent and therefore heat diffuses between the einstein oscillators on a time scale of 1/2 the period of vibration .",
    "einstein s theory could not explain the large thermal conductivities of most crystalline dielectrics but his and related models @xcite are useful for understanding the thermal conductivity of amorphous materials and crystals with certain types of strong disorder .",
    "we include larger oscillating entities than the single atoms considered by einstein by borrowing from the debye model of lattice vibrations and dividing the sample into regions of size @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an acoustic wavelength , and whose frequencies of oscillation are given by the low frequency speed of sound @xmath9 @xcite . @xmath10 the index @xmath11 labels the three sound modes ( two transverse and one longitudinal ) with speeds of sound @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the cutoff frequency for each polarization expressed in degrees k , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number density of atoms .",
    "this model has no free parameters and is in good agreement with data for a wide variety of bulk disordered materials near room temperature @xcite .",
    "since diamond has the largest values of @xmath15 and @xmath12 @xcite of any material , the high temperature limit of @xmath6 also has the largest possible value .",
    "figure 1 shows the calculated @xmath16 for diamond with comparisons to previously published data for amorphous carbon @xcite .",
    "data for bulk samples of high - dose neutron - irradiated diamond @xcite and disordered carbon produced by high - pressure conversion of @xmath17 @xcite were measured by traditional steady - state methods ; the conductivities of thin film samples were measured using the mirage effect @xcite and picosecond thermoreflectance @xcite .",
    "the thin film data were measured only for room temperature , and therefore the unusual temperature of the two bulk samples can not be confirmed in the thin film samples .",
    "furthermore , while picosecond reflectance is a powerful probe of elastic properties and interfacial transport of acoustic and thermal energy , measurements of thermal conductivity using this method are relatively indirect and require assumptions about the heat capacity of the films @xcite .",
    "thin film samples of a - c : h were prepared at the max - planck - institut fr plasmaphysik by remote - plasma chemical vapor deposition ( rpcvd)chosen to produce a soft , low - density form of a - c : h  and by plasma - assisted cvd ( pacvd ) ; the pacvd samples have mechanical properties that are typical for protective coatings of `` diamond - like - carbon '' ( dlc ) @xcite .",
    "carbon - to - hydrogen ratios measured on similar samples are 1:1 for rpcvd and 2:1 for pacvd .",
    "additional samples of dlc films were obtained from delphi automotive systems and surmet corporation . at lawrence berkeley laboratory ,",
    "a - c films were deposited by filtered - arc deposition ( fad ) @xcite using two acceleration voltages , 100 and 2000 v. the fractions of @xmath4 bonded carbon measured by eels @xcite on similar samples are 80% at 100 v bias and 30% at 2000 v bias ; a - c films with low concentrations of hydrogen and carbon bonding dominated by @xmath4 hybridization are often referred to as `` amorphous diamond '' ( a - d ) or `` tetrahedrally - bonded '' amorphous carbon ( ta - c ) .",
    "we use the @xmath1 method @xcite to measure the thermal conductivity of a - c films in the temperature range @xmath18  k. a @xmath19 m wide al line  sputter deposited on the surface of the sample and patterned by photolithography  serves as both the heater and the thermometer in the measurement .",
    "if the film thickness @xmath20 is small compared to the width of the metal line , heat flow is one - dimensional in the thin film and two - dimensional ( radial ) in the substrate @xcite . also , as long as @xmath20 is small compared to the penetration depth of the thermal waves , the thin film simply adds a frequency - independent temperature oscillation to the known thermal response of the substrate .",
    "most of our a - c samples were deposited on si substrates with a 100 nm thick layer of thermally grown sio@xmath21 which is needed to improve the electrical isolation between the si substrates and the al metallization .",
    "the added thermal resistance of the sio@xmath21 layer is measured separately and subtracted from the raw data @xcite .",
    "conversion of the measured thermal resistance to thermal conductivity requires accurate measurements of film thickness @xmath20 .",
    "we measure @xmath20 using spectroscopic variable - angle ellipsometry ; the optical properties of the a - c films are modeled using a fit to the resonant frequency , oscillator strength , and damping of two lorentz - oscillators . alternatively , e.g. , if the optical modeling produced a poor fit to the ellipsometry data , we use scanning electron microscopy of a fracture cross - section to measure @xmath20 .",
    "areal densities of carbon are measured using rutherford backscattering spectrometry of the stopping power of the a - c film .",
    "the combination of areal density and @xmath20 gives the film density , see table i. we measure longitudinal speeds of sound @xmath22 by `` picosecond ultrasonics '' @xcite : an al thin - film transducer produces and detects acoustic waves generated by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser operating at 780 nm ; values for @xmath22 are listed in table i.",
    "figure 2 shows the results of our thermal conductivity measurements . in all cases , the thermal conductivity has the temperature dependence expected for an amorphous solid in this temperature range @xcite . in four cases , we measured the same type of film for two values of the thickness @xmath20 to determine the effects of the finite thermal conductance of interfaces on our measurements @xcite . for the relatively low conductivities of the rpcvd and pacvd films ,",
    "see fig .  2a",
    ", the interface effects have little effect on the measured conductivity of films with @xmath23 nm .",
    "interface effects are more pronounced in the fad films , see fig .",
    "2b . using the assumption that the true conductivity of the film is independent of film thickness",
    ", we can separate the true conductivity of the film from the interface thermal conductance @xcite ; for both sets of fad films shown in fig .",
    "2b , the true conductivity is @xmath24% larger than the measured conductivity of the thicker film .",
    "we have discovered that effective medium theory @xcite provides a surprisingly good description of the variation of conductivity with mass density @xcite .",
    "the conductivity of a composite structure made of a matrix material and spherical inclusions of a second phase is given by @xcite : @xmath25^{1/2}~ , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the conductivity of the matrix , @xmath27 is the conductivity of the second phase , and @xmath28 are the volume fractions of the matrix and second phase , respectively .",
    "figure 3 compares the predictions of this theory to the room temperature conductivity of a - c films .",
    "the theory fits the data reasonably well and enables us to extrapolate the conductivity to the full density of diamond , @xmath29 w m@xmath3 k@xmath3 .",
    "experiments on a - c have often been interpreted in terms of heterogeneous microstructures @xcite , but the accuracy and generality of these various microstructural models remains controversial .",
    "our two - component model , see eq .  2 and fig .  3 , for",
    "the thermal conductivity is probably an oversimplification of the true complexity of a - c microstructures .",
    "nevertheless , we believe this phenomenological model will be a useful engineering guide for predicting the conductivity of a - c films when only the density is known .",
    "figure 2 also includes comparisons of the data to the calculated @xmath6 for samples a ( dlc prepared by pacvd ) and h ( `` amorphous diamond '' prepared by fad ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath6 is steeper than the data ; this result is generally observed for both bulk @xcite and thin film @xcite amorphous materials since eq .",
    "1 does not include contributions to the heat transport by low frequency phonons with long mean - free - paths @xcite .",
    "but in the high temperature limit , the agreement is good , particularly for sample h , see fig .",
    "the agreement between the measured and calculated conductivities is made more explicit in fig .",
    "4 where we compare the high temperature limit of @xmath6 to the data at 400 k , the highest temperature of our measurements .",
    "( data for sample l are restricted to @xmath30 k because of stray electrical conductance at higher temperatures . in this case",
    ", we have extrapolated the data to 400 k using the temperature dependence of sample h. ) the calculations reproduce the trend in the data well ; we note , however , that the calculated conductivities are consistently greater than the measured values .",
    "the fact that the thermal conductivities are increasing with temperature contributes to this discrepancy ; measurements at higher temperatures would show better agreement with the model .",
    "for the lowest conductivity films , however , the temperature dependence of the data is relatively weak and the calculated conductivity exceeds the measured value at 400 k by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "this relatively large difference between measured and calculated conductivity is also observed in amorphous se @xcite . but given the simplifying assumptions of the model @xcite , disagreements of this magnitude are expected and we conclude that the minimum thermal conductivity calculated from the mean atomic densities and speeds of sound provides an adequate description of heat transport in a wide variety of a - c thin film materials .",
