    "it is clear by now , that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "entanglement is recognized as an important resource for quantum computation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum black holes @xcite and many other quantum tasks .",
    "it was also demonstrated experimentally that entanglement can affect macroscopic properties of solids , albeit at very low ( critical ) temperature ( below 1 kelvin ) @xcite .",
    "any quantum state @xmath1 , has an ensemble decomposition , i.e. there exist quantum states @xmath2 with a probability distribution @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "if there exists an ensemble decomposition where every @xmath2 is a separable state , then @xmath1 is called a separable state ; otherwise , it is called an entangled state .    detecting entanglement of a given state",
    ", however , is known to be a hard computational problem ( np ) @xcite .",
    "several methods of detecting entanglement are bell and spin squeezing inequalities @xcite , measurement of nonlinear properties of the state @xcite , approximation of positive maps @xcite .",
    "we shall focus in this paper on a method known as _",
    "entanglement witnesses _ @xcite .",
    "this method is unique because it is valid for any quantum system , regardless of the number and dimensions of its subsystems @xcite .",
    "an entanglement witness ( ew ) is an hermitian ( non - positive ) operator , whose expectation value is positive for any separable state .",
    "therefore , when applied to a state of interest , a negative expectation value directly indicates the entanglement in this state . based on the theorem below @xcite",
    ", the ew is a necessary and sufficient condition for entangled states : + theorem ( horodecki96 ) : a density matrix @xmath1 on @xmath5 is entangled if and only if there exists a hermitian operator @xmath6 , an _ entanglement witness _ , such that @xmath7 and for all separable states @xmath8 , @xmath9    furthermore , for every entangled state , there exists an ew to detect it @xcite .",
    "however , a specific ew can have a positive expectation value also when evaluated on entangled states .",
    "in fact , no entanglement witness can discern separable states from entangled ones with 100% success rate .",
    "that is , there are always undecideable states with respect to any entanglement witness ( hopefully , not too many , because this will render the ew ineffective ) .",
    "we do not consider in this work the optimality property of the ew , but for the sake of completeness we note that an entanglement witness is said to be optimal if there exists no other ew which is finer , i.e. has a larger set of decideable states @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this ew method is that we change the system s state when measuring the witness ( unless the system is in some particular eigenstate ) .",
    "we shall further analyze this feature and see how to overcome it in sec .",
    "1 using what we term a `` sterile '' entanglement witness . we will show that for many decideable states , one can evaluate the witness while negligibly changing the state of the system .",
    "we will focus on spin systems having nearest - neighbors interactions , with an ew corresponding to a heisenberg model without an external magnetic field .",
    "this ew describes fully coupled @xmath10 spin @xmath11 particles in the form of a complete graph @xcite .",
    "the outline of the work is as follows .",
    "we begin by presenting in sec .",
    "1 the proposed ew and show it is a `` sterile '' one . in sec .  2 , a tripartite analogy is discussed between degeneracies of the witness eigenstates , tensor products of @xmath0 representations and lattice paths which generalize the catalan numbers .",
    "a few examples are analyzed .",
    "we then derive the fraction of decideable states for various @xmath11 and @xmath10 values in sec .  3 and",
    "show that it remains finite when @xmath12 .",
    "the proposed ew is given by the square of the total spin operator , or casimir operator @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total spin in each direction .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath15 are given by the familiar eigenvalues of @xmath16 @xmath17 this ew was previously studied by t@xmath18th @xcite , who used the above model for the case of spin @xmath19 particles .",
    "the existence of undecideable states can be most easily demonstrated in a simple system of two spins .",
    "the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both separable .",
    "the proposed ew is a linear operator , hence we may consider their superposition . on the one hand , these states construct the spin-0 singlet state @xmath22 , which is maximally entangled .",
    "it has the lowest possible @xmath6 value , and hence will be identified by it . on the other hand , a different superposition @xmath23 ,",
    "having spin @xmath24 , will not be recognized as an entangled state since @xmath25 and @xmath26 have @xmath27 too .    for a spin @xmath28 system ,",
    "the spin operator is given in terms of the three pauli matrices @xmath29 .",
    "the expectation value of separable spin 1/2 states is bounded @xmath30 hence , if the measured value of the ew is small enough , the @xmath10-particle state is understood to be entangled , while if the ew is high , we can not tell with certainty if the state is entangled or separable .",
    "however , by knowing the degeneracy of the witness eigenstates , we can determine the fraction of all states which are decideable .",
    "the degeneracy of states with eigenvalue @xmath15 for even @xmath10 were analytically found in @xcite @xmath31 as will be described in sec .  2 ,",
    "@xmath32 are strictly related to the so - called catalan triangle @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will derive in sec .  2 the above formula from the structure of @xmath0 tensor products and generalize it to systems of arbitrary spins .",
    "we will also relate this problem to a classical problem of enumerative combinatorics - finding the number of constrained lattice paths in 2d .",
    "the question now is whether we can detect entanglement using the above operator @xmath6 without disturbing much the local dynamics of the system given by some hamiltonian @xmath33 . in other words",
    ", we would like to verify that @xmath34 = o(n),\\ ] ] when evaluated in some subspace of entangled states , i.e. the commutation relation , being a sub - extensive quantity , is asymptotically dominated by the size of the system .",
    "this is , of course , not the usual notion of commutation ( which evidently is not satisfied by our ew ) , but we find it more appropriate for describing weak operations on large systems as will be shown below .    to demonstrate we shall use the quite general nearest - neighbors interactions within a 3d homogenous heisenberg lattice : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vector @xmath37 of the @xmath38th particle , and the coupling constant @xmath39 ( corresponding to the anti - ferromagnetic case ) is not necessarily small .    using the well - known commutation relations between angular momentum operators , we find : @xmath40 = ij\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ { [ j_x , s_y^is_z^{i+1}]+[j_y , s_z^is_x^{i+1}]+[j_z , s_x^i s_y^{i+1}]\\}.\\ ] ]    anti - parallel spins are obviously preferred by this local hamiltonian .",
    "when the ew is evaluated , for instance , in the ground state of @xmath33 , we have @xmath41 ( the total @xmath42 along each axis is low because only a few spins do not cancel ) , and hence follows .",
    "this can be easily seen also in the first eigenstates of @xmath33 , where both @xmath33 and @xmath6 remain small .",
    "recall that @xmath15 grows as @xmath43 , so if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , will be satisfied .",
    "this relation between @xmath33 and @xmath6 maintains its meaning until @xmath46 , which is the minimal energy of separable states in this heisenberg lattice model @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that when having a large system in one of its lower , highly entangled states , @xmath47 would be negligibly affected if evaluated on this state or this state with two altered spins , as in .",
    "this means that an entangled state , as well as the system s energy corresponding to it , are likely to change only slightly after the entanglement witness @xmath6 has been applied .",
    "the same does not hold though , for a separable state . in the limit of @xmath48 ,",
    "the asymptotic relation in implies an approximate notion ( in the macroscopic sense ) of commutation . in this limit",
    ", the fraction of non - parallel spins goes to zero , while the fraction of entangled states that are decideable stays finite , as we shall see in sec .",
    "hence , the relative change in energy due to the application of the ew gets very small .",
    "these arguments can be straightforwardly applied also to other forms of local dynamics such as the xy model and the bose - hubbard model using the suitable bounds which were calculated in @xcite .",
    "eq . follows from a general relation between tensor products of @xmath0 representations and degeneracies of witness eigenstates .",
    "this relation is based on the fact that the eigenvalue @xmath15 only depends on the overall spin @xmath49 of the eigenstate , which specifies the irreducible representation ( irrep ) @xmath50 $ ] of @xmath0 according to which it transforms under rotations .",
    "tensors in 3d . ] as a consequence the degeneracy of states with eigenvalue @xmath15 is given by the number of distinct states of spin @xmath49 .",
    "the number of states of spin @xmath49 that can be created from @xmath10 spin @xmath11 irreps is given by the multiplicity of the irrep @xmath50 $ ] in the tensor product @xmath51^{\\otimes n } = \\underbrace{[s]\\otimes [ s ] \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes [ s]}_{n \\text{~times}},\\ ] ] multiplied by the dimension of this irrep @xmath52)=2j+1 $ ] @xmath53 ) \\",

    "the number of lattice paths up to @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of paths ending at @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath38 increases in integer steps , i.e.  it takes only integer or half - integer values depending on whether @xmath69 is an integer or half - integer . with these recursion relations it is possible to efficiently calculate the multiplicities for high values of @xmath10 .",
    "let us now give further insight into the lattice paths defined above by discussing the first few examples .",
    "where available , we will make connections to the mathematical literature regarding the lattice paths .",
    "for @xmath70 the paths are given by the allowed steps @xmath71 two examples are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin12ex ] .",
    "these directed lattice paths , which do not go below the @xmath72-axis and end at a point @xmath73 after @xmath10 steps are known to be counted by the catalan triangle @xmath74 @xcite , which is given for any @xmath75 by @xmath76 using this formula it is easy to see that and match .",
    "for the special case of the ground state in the degeneracy is given by the @xmath77 catalan number @xmath78 .",
    "this degenerate ground state ( macroscopic singlet state ) is particularly interesting , e.g. for magnetometry @xcite and black hole entropy calculations @xcite . in the next two subsections its degeneracy",
    "is stated for some higher spin systems .",
    "next we consider a system of @xmath79 particles .",
    "when increasing @xmath11 , the lattice paths become less standard due to additional constraints from . for @xmath79",
    "the paths can only reach integer values of @xmath80 and the allowed steps are @xmath81 an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin1ex ] .",

    "this sequence of integers ( with or without the zeroes ) is not known in mathematical literature but can explicitly solve the @xmath91 case as was done above for lower spin systems .    continuing according to the same logic , the allowed steps for @xmath92 are @xmath93 for instance , the degeneracies for the case of @xmath82 are : + 0 , 1 , 1 , 5 , 16 , 65 , 260 , 1085 ,",

    "we elaborate in the next section on the fraction of decideable states in all the above cases .",
    "to generalize , we employ the theory of entanglement detection with uncertainty relations @xcite . for every @xmath10 particle separable state",
    "it was shown that @xcite : @xmath96 therefore , if we define in a system of @xmath10 spin-@xmath11 particles the ew as the total magnetization , then for separable states it is bounded from below by @xmath97 : @xmath98 all states with witness eigenvalues below this bound are entangled , so using the witness levels one finds the fraction of decidable states to be @xmath99 in figures [ fig : spin12h][fig : spin2h ] this fraction is plotted for @xmath100 , respectively , where systems comprised of up to 10,000 spins were analyzed .",
    "computing the tensor products to such high orders was possible only owing to the recursion relation .",
    "interestingly , the points lie on curves that are constrained to a certain range . for half - integer @xmath11 the points for even and odd @xmath10 ( the case of odd @xmath10",
    "is studied here for the first time ) lie on different curves , while for integer @xmath11 they lie on the same curves .",
    "it seems that @xmath101 converges for large @xmath10 , meaning that all points lie between two curves which monotonically approach the same constant @xmath102 .",
    "a good approximation of these constants can be made based on the rightmost jump in @xmath101 in a given graph .",
    "for example , the last jump in @xmath103 below @xmath10410,000 is at @xmath105 hence @xmath102 must lie in between these values @xmath106 the corresponding values @xmath102 for @xmath11 up to 5 are given in table [ tab : decidable_fractions ] .",
    "they are plotted in figure [ fig : f_infinity ] , together with a fitted curve given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 the sum of squared residuals of the fit is @xmath109 the results of the graphs below suggest that for various spin systems of arbitrary size , there is a considerable amount of many - body entangled states that can be detected by the proposed ew .",
