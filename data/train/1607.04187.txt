    "at the end of 2015 , both the atlas and cms collaborations have reported an excess in the diphoton mass spectrum near @xmath5  gev by using the lhc data collected at @xmath6  tev  @xcite . although the statistical significance of their findings has not been conclusive yet - local ( global ) significances by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite are 3.9@xmath7 ( 2.1@xmath7 ) and 3.4@xmath7 ( 1.6@xmath7 ) ,",
    "respectively - it has motivated many particle physicists to propose models for the physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) , and to study their phenomenological implications to reveal the physics behind the observed excess  @xcite . as there have appeared various scenarios to explain the observed excess , what we could conclude so far about the observed excess is limited .    in this paper",
    ", we study the prospect of investigating the physics behind the observed excess , if it is indeed coming from some new physics , at the future international linear collider  ( ilc ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a `` standard '' scenario that there exists a new particle @xmath0 having a mass around 750  gev and a coupling to a pair of photons , and study the experimental methods for profiling @xmath0 taking advantage of clean environments of electron - positron collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "we also focus our studies on the @xmath8 collision instead of @xmath9 collision  @xcite , and on the associate production : @xmath2 or @xmath10 despite the possibility of @xmath11channel production through @xmath12 if @xmath0 couples to @xmath8 directly  @xcite . comparing to the existing feasibility studies of @xmath0 resonance at lepton colliders  @xcite , the new aspects of this paper are on the following two points .",
    "firstly , we present comprehensive theoretical analysis on the @xmath13 productions at the ilc taking into account the beam polarisations and angular distributions , which are useful for cp measurement . secondly , we give results based on full detector simulation and realistic beam beam interactions .",
    "complementary to the search at the lhc , we explore the measurement of absolute production cross sections as well as the partial decay widths of @xmath0 using recoil technique , which are possible only at lepton colliders .",
    "furthermore , we study the searches for @xmath3 decay , which is interesting in the models where @xmath0 is connected to dark matter , and for @xmath4 decay , which is very challenging to look for at the lhc .",
    "it is worth emphasising that even though the studies are done for the unconfirmed @xmath0 resonance , the theoretical calculations and experimental methods developed in this paper are quite general and useful for studies at lepton colliders of any similar new particles which couple to diphoton .",
    "this paper can hence be considered as a case study for new particle search at the ilc .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce a theoretical framework in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , and present analytic results for @xmath14 in sec .",
    "[ sec : xatilc ] .",
    "section  [ sec : simulation ] is devoted to realistic simulation studies at the ilc .",
    "we present the summary and conclusions of this paper in sec .",

    "the coupling of a neutral boson to a pair of photons is naturally interpreted by loop diagrams of ( the sm or new ) particles which are charged under the su(2)@xmath15 and/or u(1)@xmath16 gauge groups of sm . in general , these also induce couplings to the other pairs of the bosons , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , if the internal particle is charged under su(3)@xmath20 , a coupling to a pair of gluons is induced as well . without specifying the details of the model for @xmath0 , but keeping generality of the nature of @xmath0 , we consider the effective couplings of @xmath0 to the sm gauge bosons based on the effective lagrangian which is invariant under the sm gauge groups .",
    "we consider @xmath0 as a spin-0 parity - even or odd particle .",
    "however , in this study , we do not consider @xmath0 as a spin-2 particle , since the realisation of the model for a massive spin-2 particle compatible with the observed diphoton excess and the other lhc constraints requires details of the theory configuration , and the collider signatures at the ilc as well as at the lhc must depend on the details .",
    "see , e.g.  refs   for studies of the spin-2 scenario .",
    "in the case where @xmath0 is a scalar ( spin-0 parity - even ) , we define the effective lagrangian , @xmath21 x_s , \\label{eq : lag0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field strength is defined as @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the gauge fields for u(1)@xmath16 , su(2)@xmath15 , and su(3)@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "summations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are implicit . for simplicity , we have neglected the cubic and quadratic terms of the su(2)@xmath15 and su(3)@xmath24 gauge fields since these are irrelevant in this paper .",
    "we introduce a common cut - off scale @xmath27 and coupling constants @xmath28 for @xmath29 , 2 , 3 . in terms of the field strengths for physical states , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where the weak mixing angle is defined as @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 ,",

    "similarly to the scalar case , the couplings @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 are given in terms of @xmath42 with @xmath29 , 2 , 3 in the same manner as with eqs .",
    "( 3 - 7 ) .    within these effective lagrangians ,",
    "the production process of @xmath0 at the lhc is the gluon - fusion process , @xmath48 .",
    "thus the event rate of @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total decay width of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath52 has to satisfy the constraint from the dijet resonance searches at the lhc , @xmath53  @xcite . by making assumptions on @xmath51 ,",
    "the values of @xmath52 and @xmath54 are bounded by the size of the observed excess in the current data .",
    "we consider two benchmark scenarios ( common for both scalar and pseudoscalar cases ) : one assuming a large decay width suggested by the current atlas analysis  ( bp1 ) , and the other assuming a minimum set of the decay modes , @xmath55  ( bp2 ) . as a typical value of @xmath54",
    ", we obtain @xmath56  ( @xmath57 ) in bp1  ( bp2 ) .",

    "we have performed a realistic simulation for @xmath2 with full detector simulation .",
    "we have shown that assuming an integrated luminosity of 2  @xmath58 at the ilc , without assuming the decay modes , the cross section of @xmath2 for erpl ( @xmath59 ) can be measured to 10% . in the case that the decay is dominated by @xmath3 , using the right - handed beam polarisations @xmath60 can be measured to 5% .",
    "if @xmath4 dominates the decay , @xmath61 can be measured to 1.6% and @xmath62 ( for elpr ) can be measured to 4.3% .",
    "@xmath63 can be extracted by two measurements of @xmath59 and @xmath64 , which together with @xmath65 can be used to further extract @xmath66 .",
    "then the absolute values of the effective couplings to @xmath67 and @xmath68 fields can be measured separately .",
    "the results can be also given in terms of the range of @xmath54 that allows ilc to detect @xmath0 with more than @xmath69 significance .",
    "interestingly enough , if @xmath4 is the dominant decay mode , the range @xmath70  mev ( @xmath71 ) can be explored at the ilc , which covers the full allowed range if the diphoton resonance is dominantly produced by @xmath72 fusion at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "to summarise , we have investigated the prospects of diphoton resonance studies in @xmath14 at the ilc . within the framework of the effective lagrangian for spin-0 hypothesis we have investigated the production cross sections as well as the angular distributions of the processes , and found that these are useful to determine the properties of the resonance , such as its mass , spin , parity , total decay - width , and absolute values of effective couplings to the su(2)@xmath15 and u(1)@xmath16 gauge fields . a realistic simulation for @xmath2 assuming the large decay width has been performed based on full detector simulation .",
    "complementary to the searches at the lhc , the absolute values of production cross - sections can be measured at the ilc using recoil technique without assuming decay modes of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the measurement at the ilc is capable of the searches for @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays with high sensitivities .",
    "it should be emphasised that the studies presented here are generic and applicable to any similar new particles which couple to @xmath9 even if the diphoton resonance turns out to be a statistical fluctuation , and hence remain useful .",
