    "when nuclei cross paths at impact parameters @xmath6 larger than twice the nuclear radius , @xmath7 , they can interact electromagnetically rather than hadronically .",
    "such events are referred to as ultra peripheral collisions ( upcs ) .",
    "the coupling between these relativistic nuclei is based on the weizscker - williams formalism  @xcite , where their highly boosted electromagnetic fields are modeled by a flux of photons with small virtuality  @xcite .",
    "the photon flux scales as the square of the nuclear charge and reaches very high values in ions with large atomic number .",
    "the interaction between the photon flux and nuclear matter is described with an intermediate fluctuation of the photons into quark antiquark dipoles ( @xmath8 ) which then scatter from the other nucleus and may emerge as a vector meson .",
    "the production cross section of the vector meson depends on the @xmath9 coupling to the nuclear target . at small transverse momentum , @xmath10 , the @xmath8 pair couples coherently to the entire nucleus .",
    "incoherent coupling takes place at higher @xmath11 where the dipole interacts with individual nucleons .",
    "the high photon flux allows for several photon exchanges per event .",
    "real photons excite giant dipole resonances or higher excitation states in the other nucleus which then usually emit one or more neutrons  @xcite in the beam direction which in turn can be used to trigger on these upc events .",
    "four models provide a description of the coherent vector meson production in upc heavy ion interactions .",
    "the first one , which we will refer to as kn ( klein and nystrand ) is based on vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and a classical - mechanical glauber approach for nuclear scattering  @xcite .",
    "the second model , named fsz ( frankfurt , strikman and zhalov ) , makes use of a generalized vmd formalism and a qcd gribov - glauber approach  @xcite .",
    "the third model iim - gm ( iancu , itakura , munier - goncalves , machado ) utilizes a qcd color dipole formalism and includes nuclear effects and parton saturation phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the fourth model ipsat - gm ( impact parameter saturation - goncalves and machado ) is based on the third one but it also includes the impact parameter dependence of the dipole interaction with the target nucleus and dglap evolution  @xcite for the target gluon distribution  @xcite .    the star collaboration has previously measured the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in auau collisions at center of mass per nucleon - pair energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev  . star observed a rather small energy dependence , with only about a @xmath3  % @xmath14  % increase in total cross section between the two beam energies .",
    "in contrast , both glauber models ( kn and fsz ) predict about a 60% rise in cross section ; the two saturation models predict a somewhat slower increase , about 30% and 33% respectively . here , we present results obtained at a lower energy of @xmath15  gev to further study the energy - dependence of the cross section .",
    "we measured the cross section for coherent exclusive @xmath16 photoproduction accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation of the beam ions and compare the measured cross section with available theoretical models .",
    "the analysis reported here is based on data collected with the star detector from auau collisions at @xmath17 = 62.4  gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "charged particles emerging from those interactions have been detected with the cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite .",
    "the tpc detected charged tracks with pseudorapidity @xmath18 and transverse momentum @xmath19  mev / c , with an overall efficiency of about 85  @xmath20 . at the time",
    "these data were collected , the tpc was surrounded by the 240 scintillator slats forming the central trigger barrel ( ctb )  @xcite .",
    "two zero degree hadron calorimeters ( zdcs )  @xcite are situated along the beam pipe at @xmath4 18  m downstream from the interaction point .",
    "the zdcs have an acceptance close to unity for neutrons originating from nuclear break - up .",
    "the data were collected with two slightly different minimum bias triggers . both triggers required that the energy in each zdc be greater than zero , so were sensitive to @xmath0 photoproduction accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation , while eliminating most cosmic - ray muons , beam - gas interactions and non beam - beam events . for the first trigger , trigger  a , this was the only requirement .",
    "the second trigger , trigger  b , also required that charged particles be detected in the ctb , eliminating empty events , such as those caused by interactions consisting of only mutual coulomb association .",
    "this trigger had a lower rate , so it was more efficient and could be run with a lower prescale .",
    "the data selection criteria applied in this analysis followed closely the ones used in previous star @xmath0 photoproduction analyses ; events should have two oppositely charged tracks , each with more than 14 out of 45 possible hits in the tpc , and both tracks should originate from a common vertex near the interaction region .",
    "vertexing efficiency at the level of two tracks has been found to be as high as 80  @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "there are several types of backgrounds to @xmath0 photoproduction : peripheral hadronic interactions , other photonuclear interactions , @xmath21 pairs from two - photon interactions @xcite , and processes such as beam - gas interactions , cosmic ray muons and pile - up events .",
    "those events have been suppressed by selecting events originating from within a cylindrical region of @xmath22 cm radius and @xmath23 cm longitudinal extension centered at the primary interaction point and containing a @xmath0 meson candidate with transverse momentum less than 150 mev / c . as was the case in previous upc star analyses  , the contribution from @xmath21 pairs was found to be negligible , and no particle identification was needed in this analysis due to the low level of background .",
    "the geometrical acceptance and the reconstruction efficiency have been studied with the help of a monte carlo event generator based on the kn model  @xcite .",
    "simulated @xmath0 photoproduction events have been used as input to the standard star detector monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the kn model reproduces the kinematic features of photoproduced @xmath0  @xcite , while the detector simulation has been well - tested on central hadronic collisions .",
    "the simulated @xmath0 were then embedded into data collected with a zero - bias trigger ( beam bunch crossing - time trigger ) .",
    "this procedure incorporates the effects of additional tracks , which are present in the data as a result of event pile - up and noise in the star tpc .",
    "the @xmath16 total reconstruction efficiency has been studied as a function of transverse momentum , rapidity , invariant mass and azimuthal and polar angles for each of the two trigger implementations .",
    "within the rapidity window @xmath24 , the mean reconstruction efficiency for the data set collected with trigger  a is 36 @xmath4 3  @xmath20 whereas the dataset collected with trigger  b is 9 @xmath4 1  @xmath20 .",
    "the reconstruction efficiencies are relatively constant as functions of transverse momentum , invariant mass , azimuthal and polar angle but slowly decrease at higher rapidity ( @xmath25 ) , due to the tpc acceptance  @xcite .",
    "the sampled luminosity has been determined based on the assumption that the main contribution to the total cross section comes from hadronic production with a well known cross section .",
    "the luminosity was measured by counting the number of events with more than 313 tracks in the tpc within @xmath26 0.5 and with at least ten hits per track .",
    "these criteria select 10  @xmath20 of the total hadronic cross section  @xcite .",
    "the final measured integrated luminosity for the data selected with trigger  a is 45 mb@xmath27 and for the one accumulated with trigger  b is 781 mb@xmath27 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty for the measured integrated luminosity is 10  @xmath20 . due to the limited luminosity sampled with trigger  a , all results in this publication are based on data obtained with trigger  b unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "the invariant mass distributions have been obtained with pairs of opposite - sign charge tracks assumed to be pions pointing to neutral two - track vertices .",
    "the resulting efficiency corrected invariant mass distributions are shown in fig .",
