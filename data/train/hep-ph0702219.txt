    "the upgrade of ceres in 1997 - 1998 by a radial time projection chamber ( tpc ) allowed to improve the momentum resolution and the particle identification capability while retaining the cylindrical symmetry ( fig .  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the tpc also opened the possibility of measuring hadrons .",
    "the upgraded experiment has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the measurement of central pb+au collisions at the maximum sps energy of 158 gev per nucleon in the fall of 2000 was the first run of the fully upgraded ceres and at the same time the last run of this experiment .",
    "about 30 million pb+au collision events at 158 gev per nucleon were collected , most of them with centrality within the top 7% of the geometrical cross section  =  6.94  b. small samples of the 20% and the minimum bias collisions , as well as a short run at 80 agev , were recorded in addition . the first two - particle correlation analysis performed on a subset of these data resulted , among others , in an improved procedure to account for the coulomb interaction @xcite and a new postulate of an universal freeze - out criterion @xcite .",
    "the current analysis features a better momentum resolution @xmath0 a better understanding of the two - track resolution , and was performed on the full data set .",
    "the @xmath1(,@xmath2 ) distribution of the analyzed pairs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] .",
    "the two - track resolution cuts applied to the true pairs and to the pairs from event mixing were different for the two possible track pair topologies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sailor - cowboy ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the required two - track cuts depended somewhat on the quality cuts applied to single tracks : the higher number of hits required for single tracks , the more pairs were lost because of the finite two - track resolution .",
    "the two - pion analysis was performed in the longitudinally co - moving frame ( lcms ) defined by the vanishing @xmath3-component of the pair momentum . the momentum difference in this frame , * q * = * p*@xmath4-*p*@xmath5 , was decomposed into the `` out '' , `` side '' , and `` long '' components following the bertsch - pratt convention , with @xmath6 pointing along the pair transverse momentum and @xmath7 along the beam .",

    "the @xmath14 fit parameters , with the indices @xmath15,@xmath16 being \\{out , side , long } , are related to the size of the source emitting pions of given momentum @xcite and will be called here hbt radii . the @xmath17 factor , @xmath18 ,",
    "accounts for the mutual coulomb interaction between the pions and was calculated by averaging the nonrelativistic coulomb wave function squared over a realistic source size .",
    "the coulomb factor was attenuated by @xmath19 similarly as the rest of the correlation function peak ; the importance of this approach was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the fits were performed by the minimum negative loglikelihood method with the poissonian number of true pairs and were done separately for each pair ( , y ) bin .",
    "the hbt radii obtained from the fit were corrected for the finite momentum resolution .",
    "the correction was determined by monte carlo and was rather insignificant for  and ; for  it gets as large as @xmath20 20% for the highest bin of the pair .",

    "a dependence of the two - pion correlations on the pair emission angle with respect to the reaction plane would be a signature of the source eccentricity at the decoupling time .",

    "the peak asymmetry indicates that the proton source is located at a larger radius than the pion source , or that protons are emitted earlier than pions .",
    "the asymmetry can be conveniently parametrized by fitting a lorentz curve , which happens to match the shape , separately to the left and to the right half of the peak , and taking the ratio of the two widths : @xmath44 where @xmath11 is a normalization factor and @xmath45 is the peak amplitude .",
    "the asymmetry is then defined as the ratio between the two widths @xmath46 .",
    "the asymmetry was translated to a spatial displacement between the proton and pion sources using a monte carlo pair generator with realistic source sizes and the coulomb wave function squared as a weighting factor for each pair .",
    "the relation between the two quantities is shown in fig .",

    "the red and blue lines represent a simultaneous fit to ( ) and @xmath47 ( ) using , respectively , eq.([eq : rsidept ] ) and the formula derived in @xcite : @xmath49 with the pair transverse mass @xmath50 and the pair transverse velocity        @xmath51    the relation between the rapidity @xmath25 and the velocity @xmath52 of transverse flow , which occur in the  and @xmath47 fit formulas , respectively , is @xmath53 the fit yields a @xmath52 of 0.65 - 0.70 and a @xmath24 of about 7.5  fm .",
    "the fit is dominated by the  data with their small error bars but it reproduces the @xmath47 values quite well .",
    "this indicates that the finite displacement between the sources of pions and protons has a similar origin as the  dependence of , namely the transverse flow .",
    "other , possibly more interesting , contributions to it can not be addressed with the present statistics of the data .",
    "while it is notoriously difficult to describe many observables of heavy ion collisions within the same theoretical approach , in recent years simple hydrodynamics - inpired parametrizations turn out to be quite successful in this aspect .",
    "the blast - wave model of @xcite , with its 8 parameters adjusted accordingly , nicely reproduces the transverse momentum spectra , the elliptic flow , and the two - particle correlations of ceres , including the emission angle dependence ( or , rather , the lack of it ) .",
    "the transverse spectra and the elliptic flow coefficients from the top 7% of  for several hadron species are shown along with the blast - wave model lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : blast0 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : blast1 ] the two - particle correlation results are compared to the calculations performed with the blast - wave model with the same parameter values .",
    "the agreement is rather good .",
    "two of the eight parameters of the model were fixed : the freeze - out temperature @xmath54  mev and the sharpness of the emission volume @xmath55 ( sharp ) .",
    "the other six parameters , adjusted to the data by the simplex method , include the transverse flow rapidity @xmath56 of 0.88 and 0.85 in - plane and out - of - plane , respectively ; the source radius @xmath57 of ( 11.26 , 11.42 )  fm ; the emission time ( i.e. the duration of the expansion ) @xmath23 of 7.4  fm , and the duration of emission @xmath58  fm / c .",
    "the nearly - circular source @xmath59 was enforced by the smallness of the second fourier component of the hbt radii ( bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig : blast1 ] ) .",
    "in summary , the new high - statistics ceres hadron data allow for state of the art analysis of two - particle correlation data .",
    "the pion source anisotropy , accessible via the dependence of the two - pion hbt radii on the emission angle with respect to the reaction plane , is unexpectedly small compared to the analogous results obtained at lower and higher energies .",
    "the pion - proton correlations indicate that the proton source is located at a larger radius than the pion source , or that protons are emitted earlier than pions .",
    "the amount of the displacement , and its functional dependence on the transverse momentum of the two involved particles , corroborate the transverse expansion picture deduced from the behavior of the   hbt radius . finally , the blast - wave parametrization is able to describe simultaneously the transverse spectra and the elliptic flow coefficients of several hadron species , and the two - particle correlations .",
