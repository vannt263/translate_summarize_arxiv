    "although there has been no direct evidence for the detection of topological defects in the universe , there are good theoretical reasons for believing their existence and reasonable prospects for the detection .",
    "it is naturally expected that topological defects , appearing as solutions to the field equation in various models of particle physics , have formed during phase transitions in the early universe through spontaneous symmetry breakings  @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings , as a remnant of unified theories , have been expected to offer a good opportunity to probe extremely high energy physics through their discovery  @xcite .",
    "recently , cosmic strings have attracted a renewed interest in the context of string cosmology since it was pointed out that a new type of cosmic strings , so - called cosmic superstrings , may be formed at the end of stringy inflation  @xcite ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic superstrings , stretched to macroscopic scales by the succeeding expansion of the universe after their formation , could be also an observable remnant of the string theory as the most promising modern unified theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the observationally important features of cosmic superstrings compared to field - theoretic ones arises from the fact that , from the four - dimensional point of view , the process of intercommutation of two strings is probabilistic ; the intercommuting probability for field - theoretic strings @xmath0 has been shown to be almost always unity  @xcite , while the value of @xmath0 can be significantly smaller for cosmic superstrings  @xcite .",
    "the intercommutation process provides an essential mechanism for a string network to lose its energy , letting the network approach to an attractor solution .",
    "therefore , observations associated with the global structure of the string network , which sensitively depends on the intercommuting probability , have a potential to give us important information about the nature of cosmic ( super-)strings .    in particular , the imprint of cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been widely studied .",
    "for example , strings induce cmb temperature anisotropies with an amplitude typically given by the dimensionless tension @xmath1 through the so - called gott - kaiser - stebbins ( gks ) effect  @xcite .",
    "historically , cosmic strings were even seriously considered as seed of structure formation in the universe  @xcite , though the observations of the acoustic oscillation in the cmb temperature power spectrum have excluded strings as a dominant source of the large - scale temperature anisotropy  @xcite . using this fact ,",
    "constraints on the tension for conventional field - theoretic strings have been derived  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been argued that there are some possibilities to detect a signal of cosmic strings in cmb as we remind readers below .",
    "first , the cmb temperature fluctuations can be dominated by those due to strings on small scales because there the primary fluctuations are damped out  @xcite .",
    "observations of the temperature angular power spectrum on small scales by , e.g. , atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite and south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite could be useful for the search for cosmic strings .    next , cosmic strings are themselves highly nonlinear objects that should induce non - gaussian fluctuations . because the primordial fluctuations from standard inflation are expected to be very close to gaussian , non - gaussian features could serve as an effective tool to detect and probe cosmic strings . the numerical simulations performed by fraisse",

    "@xcite have shown that the obtained one - point probability distribution function has a large deviation from the gaussian distribution .",
    "in particular , the one - point probability distribution function has negative skewness and a non - gaussian tail .",
    "these non - gaussian statistics could be distinctive features from primary fluctuations and other secondary effects , and may enhance the observability of cosmic strings in future small - scale observations  @xcite .",
    "finally , the cmb polarizations , especially the b - mode could be a useful probe of cosmic strings through the future observations such as planck  @xcite , cmbpol  @xcite , actpol  @xcite , sptpol  @xcite , and litebird  @xcite .",
    "so far , at least two sources of the b - mode due to cosmic strings have been studied .",
    "one is gravitational wave bursts from the small - scale structures on strings  @xcite and the others are vector and tensor perturbations produced by a string network itself ; recent numerical simulations  @xcite showed that the contribution from the network of conventional field - theoretic strings can dominate the b - mode spectrum over the angular range @xmath2 .    in this paper , we investigate gravitational weak lensing due to cosmic ( super-)strings as yet another source of the b and other modes .",
    "this is to be distinguished from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , which corresponds to the angular scale where the primary fluctuations are damped , namely , small angular scale  @xcite .",
    "the b polarizations are induced by lensing as the partial conversion of the primary e polarizations .",
    "first , we calculate the spectrum of the convergence field due to strings using the segment formalism developed in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain the temperature and polarization spectra of the cmb , clarifying how they can vary according to the value of the intercommuting probability @xmath3 .",

    "in this paper , we gave calculations of cosmic ( super-)string contributions to the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb induced by gravitational weak lensing .",

    "it would be interesting to compare with numerical simulations and study the large - angle behavior of power spectrum of the scalar lensing potential and the string - induced cmb polarizations .",
    "it is also important to discuss lensing contributions to the cmb bispectrum .",
