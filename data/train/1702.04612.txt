    "_ further details of samples and experiments : _ the powder samples of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 were originally described in refs .",
    "they were prepared from stochiometric ratios of the oxides ho@xmath0o@xmath86 or dy@xmath0o@xmath86 , and tio@xmath0 in a solid state reaction .",
    "the oxides , with 99.99% purity , were annealed at 850 @xmath87c for 10 hours , then mixed and ground , and heated at 950 - 1300 @xmath87c for 140 hours with several intermediate grindings .",
    "the structures were verified by combined neutron and x - ray diffraction experiments , which were carried out on hrpt  @xcite at sinq , psi and the materials science beamline ( msb )  @xcite at the sls , psi .",
    "rietveld refinement of the structures as implemented in the fullprof  @xcite software proved both samples to be of high quality and single phase .",
    "for the qens experiment on focus , to overcome the strong absorption of natural isotopic abundance dysprosium we used a flat plate sample holder with very thin layer of sample .",
    "the plate was oriented perpendicular to the incident beam to reduce the path length of neutrons in the sample , and we used data from low angle detectors only . to have reasonable statistics",
    "requires long counting times .",
    "we also confirmed some points by measuring our isotopically enriched crystal of @xmath88dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , but the crystal is much smaller than the cross section of the beam so intersects relatively few incident neutrons and hence does not greatly improve the situation .",
    "ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 can be used directly as a packed powder and the count rate is much larger .    _",
    "magnetoelastic coupling constants : _ the determination of an absolute value for the magnetoelastic coupling constant @xmath89 from the fitted @xmath90 parameters is difficult . despite having the full calculated pyrochlore phonon spectrum  @xcite ,",
    "there is a large uncertainty connected with the evaluation of the partial phonon densities of states @xmath30 , which only includes individual vibrational modes that transform according to the representation @xmath19 .",
    "we note however , that all vibrational modes involved in the model in both compounds are dominated by the motion of the oxygen o(48@xmath91 ) ions , which surround the rare earth ion .",
    "hence , the partial phonon density of states of the o(48@xmath91 ) ions gives at least good estimates for the ratios of the @xmath30 at different energy transfers @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore estimate all the magnetoelastic coupling constants @xmath92 for the intermediate cef states in both ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 relative to the coupling constant @xmath93 of the third intermediate cef state in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath61mev : @xmath94 } { b_3\\delta_3 z_{\\text{o}(48f)}(\\delta_i ) \\left [ \\sum_{\\mu } \\sum_{j=\\pm}|\\langle j|q(\\mu)|v_i^j\\rangle|^2 \\right ] } } , \\ ] ] where the summation @xmath95 runs over the two members of the corresponding ground state doublet and all members of the excited intermediate cef state @xmath96",
    ". the ratios of the partial phonon densities of states are taken as : @xmath97 @xmath98 in order to compare between two different ions , we calculate the ratios of the bare magnetoelastic coupling constants @xmath99 , which follow from @xmath100 @xcite with the stevens factors @xmath101 of the rare earth ions , here @xmath102 and @xmath103 for ho@xmath3 and dy@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the resulting ratios are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] .",
    "we find that the bare magnetoelastic coupling constants of all intermediate cef states in the two compounds depend linearly on the energy transfer of the intermediate states within errorbars . given a linear mode coupling such as between the quadrupolar operators and the normal modes of vibration in the magnetoelastic interaction operator of eq .",
    "[ eq : orbacheq ] , it is plausible that the magnetoelastic coupling strength vanishes in the limit of zero energy transfer and is generally highest at high energy transfer .",
    "the experimental observations are therefore consistent with the expectation and give strong support for the phonon mediated mechanism with the established intermediate cef states in both rare earth pyrochlore titanates ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .    , using the partial phonon density of states for the o(@xmath47 ) for @xmath104 , normalizing the rare earth ions by the stevens factors @xmath101 , and scaling to highest energy coupling in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . ]    _ relation with previously described relaxation processes : _ previously two relaxation processes have been reported in both compounds  @xcite . in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "these can be seen in @xmath5 experiments because the relative rates of them are favorable for this technique .",
    "the low temperature process , ascribed to quantum tunneling due to the plateau in the relaxation time at intermediate temperatures , is sufficiently slow that it does not compete with the high temperature process even as this becomes slow at temperatures of @xmath105 k. hence peaks can be observed in @xmath106 ( as measured by @xmath5 ) as each process dominates the relaxation in the experimental frequency range , first the high temperature process at @xmath105 k , then the low temperature process at @xmath107 k. in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , the low temperature process seems to be relatively much faster , and competes with the high temperature process effectively on the time scales of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , one can not observe a peak in @xmath106 that corresponds to the high temperature process using @xmath5 measurements . to observe the high temperature process one must go to higher temperatures where the low temperature process is no longer competitive and the high temperature process is necessarily much faster .",
    "this means that techniques with shorter timescales are required to observe it , which is why it was originally found using neutron spin echo and quasielastic neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the high temprature process in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 was fitted by an arrhenius law with activation energy @xmath108 mev , which was compared to the first cfe . at this time ,",
    "the exact energy of the cfe was not actually known , but was expected to be of this order .",
    "it is now known to be at @xmath109 mev  @xcite . in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "the activation energy was given as @xmath110 mev , but the cfes are at @xmath111 mev .",
    "the high temperature process was described as a flipping of the spin via the first cfe , but in this case the activation energy should match exactly the energy of the cfe , and the arrhenius law should describe the relaxation time throughout the temperature range where the process is dominant .",
    "neither of these conditions is actually fulfilled , particularly when the relaxation time is measured to higher temperatures .    however , the previous investigations showed that the presence or absence of a peak in @xmath112 depends on the relative rate of high and low temperature processes . in absence of a competing low temperature process",
    "ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 would also have a peak in @xmath112 for the high temperature process at a similar temperature to dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this condition is still satisfied if the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate provided by our model is treated in an analogous fashion .",
    "hence the phonon - mediated model provides a physical explanation and quantitative description of all known observations about the high temperature processes ."

    "<S> we support the model with direct experimental evidence of the coupling between crystal field states and optical phonons in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .    in rare earth compounds , magnetic responses can be strongly and non - monotonically dependent on the strength or frequency of applied magnetic field , or the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> examples include stepped magnetization curves in single ion magnets  @xcite , or the multiply - peaked susceptibility response in liyf@xmath2:ho@xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects appear because there are competing mechanisms that can contribute to the flipping of large rare earth magnetic moments . owing to their different origins - conduction electrons  @xcite , phonon - mediated ( e.g. direct , raman , orbach , and phonon bottleneck effects  @xcite ) , or quantum mechanical ( tunneling , thermally assisted tunneling between excited states , resonant tunneling at electronic - nuclear level crossings , and co - tunneling  @xcite ) - these mechanisms </S>",

    "<S> the magnetization dynamics of the low temperature coulomb phase  @xcite should be described by the cooperative behavior of the thermal population of emergent magnetic monopoles  @xcite , which form a magnetic coulomb gas . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the spin relaxation time , @xmath4 , of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , as extracted from @xmath5 , has been explained with considerable success by the monopole picture : both a thermally activated regime at @xmath6 k  @xcite ( which we call low temperature ) and temperature independent plateau for @xmath7 k ( intermediate temperature ) are captured well by a theory of monopole hopping in dilute ( unscreened ) and concentrated ( screened ) magnetic coulomb gases respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reentrant low temperature thermal activation is due to interactions between unscreened monopoles .    for a monopole to hop </S>",
    "<S> , a spin must be flipped , and because the plateau of @xmath4 was previously associated with quantum tunneling of the large , ising - like dy@xmath3 moments between the members of their ground state doublet  @xcite , monopoles were assumed to hop by tunneling of the spins with temperature independent attempt frequency  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting picture should describe the coulomb gas realized in each material by relating the energy for monopole creation and unbinding to the exchange interactions  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> studies of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite in which the intermediate temperature plateau was ascribed to quantum tunneling of the spins also revealed a second thermally activated regime for @xmath8 k ( i.e. high temperature ) . </S>",

    "<S> a rare earth ion is excited from one crystal field state to an intermediate excited state by absorption of a phonon , and then relaxes to a third state by emission of another phonon . </S>",
