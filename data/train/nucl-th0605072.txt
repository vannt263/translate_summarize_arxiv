    "one of the main goals of the heavy ion program is to understand the nature of the hadron production mechanism ( e.g.  parton coalescence , string fragmentation or cluster decay ) .",
    "recent rhic data on jet quenching and elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) can be interpreted as an evidence of forming a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) during the collision of two heavy gold nuclei at center of mass energy @xmath1  gev  @xcite . however , the detailed mechanism how the deconfined partonic matter transforms to hadrons is still unknown .",
    "using correlations and fluctuations to probe the nature of the created qcd matter has been proposed by many authors @xcite . unfortunately , the experimental exploration of most of the suggested fluctuation signals did not yield positive evidence for the formation of a qgp .",
    "nevertheless , this must not be seen as a contradiction to the formation of a partonic state at rhic or sps energies , because the proposed signatures may be weakened due to many effects ( e.g.  the phase transition is not a strict first order transition - which is the case for rhic energies ) .",
    "other possibilities are that rescattering and/or re - thermalization in the late qgp or in the subsequent hadronic stage may blur the fluctuation signals . furthermore , the fluctuation signals might be modified and cloaked by the hadronization process itself",
    ". however , we want to point out that recent studies of rescattering and/or diffusion in the hadronic environment , seem to indicate that the diffusion in the hadronic stage might be small enough to allow a survival of the initial correlations @xcite .    in this letter we explore the forward - backward charge fluctuations @xcite to probe the particle production mechanism via cluster decay .",
    "long ago , the number @xmath2 of charged particles produced per cluster decay was estimated in pp and p@xmath3 interactions by the ua5 experiment @xcite .",
    "it was found that the effective multiplicity per cluster is @xmath4 .",
    "recently , the phobos experiment performed a similar analysis for au+au reactions at @xmath1  gev and reports that @xmath5 for peripheral collisions and @xmath6 for central collisions .",
    "note that all measured cluster multiplicities are larger than expected for a hadron resonance gas ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , indicating that the measured charge correlations can not be described by simple statistical models based on hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "our goal is to explore how the cluster structure changes if deconfined matter is formed .",
    "the meaning of the term cluster is rather general , for example it could be a hadronic resonance , a partonic string or a qgp droplet . either the survival or the destruction of the clusters provides indirect information about the properties of the surrounding medium .",
    "for example what is the percentage of particles produced by cluster decays , are the hadronic expectations compatible with the data or not and if a hot and dense ( partonic ?",
    ") medium is formed or not .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we develop a model that describes the multiplicity fluctuations @xmath8 as measured by the phobos experiment @xcite .",
    "this measure is sensitive to charged particle production via cluster decay . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we apply our model to interpret the phobos data and to estimate the fraction @xmath9 of particles produced via cluster decay . in section [ centrality ]",
    "we discuss the results of our analysis of the measured data @xcite for central au+au collisions .",
    "next , we address how the formation of a dense medium affects the dynamical fluctuations because it might influence both the cluster multiplicity and the short range rapidity correlation length . finally , we comment on the behavior of the dynamical fluctuations in central collisions . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize the main results of this letter .",
    "in this section we develop a model to describe forward - backward charge correlations .",
    "we define two symmetric rapidity regions at @xmath10 with equal width @xmath11 .",
    "the number of charged particles in the forward rapidity interval @xmath12 is @xmath13 while the corresponding number in the backward hemisphere @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "we define the correlation variable @xmath16 such that c=.the event - by - event fluctuations ( variance ) @xmath8 of @xmath16 are decomposed into two parts , weighted by the respective fractions @xmath9 and @xmath17 of particles from the different sources : [ eq : definition ] ^2_c = f ^2_sr+(1-f)^2_lr . the first term in eq . ( [ eq : definition ] ) @xmath18 denotes the short range correlation due to cluster decays .",
    "this term is a direct measure of the particle production via cluster decay . as discussed above",
    ", the specific nature of the clusters is rather general .",
    "@xmath18 depends on the observability of the decay daughters in the rapidity width @xmath11 , so that when @xmath11 is larger than the size of the cluster one is able to observe all the decay products of this cluster . however , if @xmath11 is small one may `` loose '' the decay products of such a cluster . to model",
    "this rapidity window effect we propose the following form [ window]^2_sr = k , where @xmath19 is the rapidity correlation length between particles produced as a result of the cluster decay and @xmath2 is the aforementioned multiplicity per cluster .",
    "the second term @xmath20 in equation ( [ eq : definition ] ) includes the fluctuations due to long range correlations between particles in both hemispheres and the background particles that are statistically independent . to describe the long range correlation",
    ", it is convenient to introduce a two body distribution function @xmath21 .",
    "such that _ 2(_1,_2)=a , where @xmath22 is the amplitude of the correlation function , giving the strength of the two body distribution when @xmath23 .",
    "generally , @xmath22 is a product of the true amplitude and a function that might depend on the motion of the center of mass rapidity of the pair @xmath24 . for the present study",
    ", we assume that @xmath22 is independent of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . under these assumptions",
    ", the long range contribution to the total fluctuations can be calculated from [ eq : main1 ] ^2__lr=1-a^-+/2_--/2d_1 ^+/2_-/2d_2  .next , we decompose the total multiplicity @xmath27 in each rapidity window @xmath11 in two parts such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the charged particle abundance produced from the decay of all clusters inside @xmath11 and @xmath30 is the number of particles migrated from outside into the rapidity window under investigation .    in each rapidity bin @xmath11",
    ", the fraction of particles produced by cluster decay @xmath9 is given by @xmath31 . with the weighting of @xmath18 and @xmath32 by @xmath9 and @xmath17 , and the abbreviation @xmath33 one rewrites equation ( [ eq : definition ] ) using eqs .",
    "( [ window ] ) and ( [ eq : main1 ] ) as [ eq : main ] ^2_c = 1+f- f(_long , , ) , where @xmath34 is the result of the double integral in equation ( [ eq : main1 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : main ] ) includes different physical situations , e.g. in case of vanishing short range correlation @xmath35 , and @xmath8 is determined solely by long range correlations . in case of @xmath36 , only short range correlations ( i.e. cluster decays ) contribute to the dynamical fluctuations .",
    "therefore , if measurements are done such that the two bins centered around @xmath37 are far from each other , the contribution from long range correlations becomes negligible . only in this case , an increase of the bin size @xmath11 to @xmath38 leads to the commonly used approximation @xmath39 from which the true cluster multiplicity can be deduced .",
    "another limiting value obeyed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) is that for a very large @xmath25 the dynamical fluctuations @xmath8 do approach the poisson value @xmath40 .",
    "this is due to the vanishing of the long range correlations and the low multiplicity which drives the fraction of correlated particles to be zero .    before we analyze the phobos data let us shortly summarize the assumptions used in the above derivations : ( i )",
    "there is only one type of clusters .",
    "( ii ) all clusters decay to the same number of particles @xmath2 , i.e. fluctuations of @xmath2 itself are not included in the present model .",
    "in this section we study the dynamical fluctuations @xmath8 for au+au collisions at @xmath1  gev .",
    "we extract the values of @xmath9 and @xmath41 from phobos data reported in @xcite .",
    "table [ table:1 ] summarizes our findings on the parameters of the present model . with these parameters ,",
    "we predict @xmath8 as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : central1 ] depicts both phobos data for @xmath42 central au+au collisions ( symbols ) and our model results ( line ) for the dynamical fluctuations  @xmath8 as a function of @xmath25 while the width of the observation window @xmath11 is kept as @xmath43 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : central2 ] we show @xmath8 versus @xmath11 , while the center of the observation window is fixed at @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that the same parameter set ( see table [ table:1 ] ) is used for both data sets in figs .",
    "[ fig : central1 ] and [ fig : central2 ] .",
    "before we discuss the interpretation of our model results , let us turn to semi - peripheral collisions . figs .  [",
    "fig : figure5 ] and [ fig : figure6 ] depict the phobos results on @xmath45 peripheral collisions . as for central collisions",
    ", the model allows to describe both data samples with the same parameter set simultaneously ( cf .",
    "table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations @xmath8 measured at @xmath44 for @xmath45 peripheral au+au collisions and a very wide rapidity windows @xmath46 yield an effective cluster multiplicity of @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ) .",
    "one observes that the short range correlation length @xmath48 is 0.6 for peripheral collisions and decreases towards @xmath49 in central collisions .",
    "this decrease of the short range correlation length is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite and was speculated to be a signal for the formation of a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the fraction of correlated particles decreases from almost 100% in peripheral collisions to 88% for central reactions .",

    "-0.15 in    in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality ] we show the experimental results from the ua5 and the phobos experiment on the fluctuations of the forward - backward correlation @xmath8 for p@xmath3 ( au+au ) at different centralities .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality ] , we see that @xmath8 starts at 2.2 for p@xmath3 and then increases to 2.7 for @xmath45 peripheral and then goes down to 2.2 again for @xmath42 central au+au .",
    "this behavior has important consequences that will help to understand the particles productions mechanism in nucleus - nucleus collisions compared to nucleon - nucleon collisions as we will discuss next .",
    "the increase in the dynamic fluctuations for @xmath45 peripheral collisions compared to p@xmath3 at the same energy might be attributed to the difference in the dynamics of the collisions between p@xmath3 and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "first let us consider the string picture for particles production in p@xmath3 collisions . during such collisions",
    "a few strings between the quarks in both protons form and are subsequently fragmented into hadrons .",
    "if the same picture holds for nucleus - nucleus collisions , then @xmath8 in both p@xmath3 and au+au will be similar and @xmath8 has a flat centrality dependence .",
    "however , experimental data indicates that the cluster multiplicity @xmath2 is increased in @xmath45 peripheral au+au collisions compared to p@xmath3 interactions .",
    "an explanation of this enhancement might be found in the context of string fusion models @xcite . here , the fusion process might increase the probability of high mass clusters compared to p@xmath3 collisions , resulting in a higher multiplicity per cluster .",
    "if the formation of heavier clusters is the explanation for the increase of @xmath2 in au+au compared to p@xmath3 , then one expects an even further increase of @xmath2 towards central au+au collisions .",
    "this enhancement will be observable if interactions with the surrounding medium are negligible compared to the increase in @xmath2 due to string fusion .",
    "5 shows that this is not the case , because the cluster multiplicity in @xmath42 central au+au collisions decreases to @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , the number of correlated particles @xmath9 also decreases towards more central au+au reactions ( cf .",
    "table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that in central collisions the interactions with the hot and dense qcd matter results in smaller clusters ( reducing the value of @xmath2 ) as compared to peripheral collisions . with even tighter centrality cuts one might be able to see a complete melting of the clusters leading to independent uncorrelated particle emission patterns ( i.e.  @xmath40 and @xmath52 ) .    to test this idea , we linearly extrapolate those parameters in table [ table:1 ] to @xmath53 au+au collisions .",
    "the last point in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality ] corresponds to this centrality cuts .",
    "we find that @xmath54 .",
    "this means that clusters formed at the most central collisions are partially melted compared to mid - peripheral collisions .",
    "also the short range correlation length @xmath19 becomes smaller .",
    "it is worth to mention that the decrease of the rapidity correlation length seems to be a general feature of nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energies since the width of the balance function expected to decrease with centrality as a result of late hadronization as mentioned in ref .",
    "this decrease is observed in the data reported in @xcite .    to distinguish between hadronic and qgp effects",
    ", @xmath8 should be measured at different energies and ion sizes and also with different transverse momentum cuts to include / exclude the effects of mini - jets , since jets hadronize into a shower of hadrons which might mimic a clustering effect ( within the jet cone ) .",
    "thus , limiting the measurement of @xmath8 to the soft region ( i.e. @xmath55  gev ) allows to minimize jet artifacts .    in this case",
    "conclusive statement can be given by comparing peripheral data to the central one to extract @xmath9 and @xmath2 for different initial conditions and to study how both @xmath9 and @xmath2 change as a function of the initial partonic volume , life time and energy density .",
    "in this letter we present a model to analyze forward - backward dynamical fluctuations as recently measured by the phobos collaboration in au+au reactions at @xmath56  gev .",
    "we find that the effective cluster multiplicity in central collisions is lower than for peripheral collisions .",
    "also the short range rapidity correlation length decreases towards more central interactions .",
    "this might indicate that the clusters are `` melted '' in central collisions , resulting in a smaller fraction of correlated particles ( decrease of @xmath9 ) .",
    "one can test the degree of melting by measuring @xmath2 as a function of centrality , and especially for very central au+au collisions . if one observes that @xmath57 , all clusters are melted and the final particles are independently emitted .",
