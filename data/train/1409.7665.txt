    "entanglement for two - qubit systems has been investigated extensively in many directions . quantifying and manipulating entanglement for systems of small dimension",
    "have been covered a in wide area of research @xcite . however , there are a lot of applications that have been implemented on quantum information and computations by using these systems theoretically and experientially .",
    "quantum teleportation , coding @xcite and cryptography represent the more important applications of entanglement . to implement these application with high efficiency , maximum entangled states ( mes )",
    "are needed . despite it",
    "is possible to generate maximum entangled states , they turn into partially entangled states ( pes ) due to their interaction with their own environments @xcite .",
    "therefore , another process is needed to recover entanglement , called quantum purification , which requires infinite number of pairs to get one mes @xcite .",
    "so , it is important to investigate the behavior of entanglement in the presences of different types of noise .",
    "there are some classes of noise states whose teleportation fidelity can be enhanced if one of the two qubits subject to dissipative interaction with the environment via amplitude damping channel @xcite .",

    "metwally showed that the phenomena of sudden single and double changes and the sudden death of entanglement are reported for identical and non - identical noise @xcite .",
    "also , the behavior of a multi - qubit system in the presence of the amplitude damping channel is investigated in @xcite , where the possibility of performing quantum teleportation with decohered states was discussed .",
