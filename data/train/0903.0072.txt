    "there are a number of well established phenomena which evidence that composite bosons made of an even number of fermions , such as for example he-4 atoms , cooper pairs , or alkali - metal atoms , behave under some conditions like ideal bosons which can condense into a macroscopic quantum state known as the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "one of the simpliest forms of such a boson is the exciton , _",
    "i.e. _ a bound electron - hole pair which characteristically appears as sharp emission and absorption features in the optical spectra of semiconductors and insulators . strong indications exist that bose - einstein condensation of excitons , predicted a long time ago @xcite , indeed occurs in man - made systems containing bilayer two - dimensional electron gases.@xcite the excitons in these systems are formed under equilibrium conditions .",
    "the appearance of bose - einstein condensation of optically - created , finite - lifetime excitons is less evident @xcite as only complex systems such as , for example , excitonic polaritons in semiconductor microcavities provide signatures of a condensate phase @xcite . the simplest system which has dominated the search for bec in optically pumped solids is the excitonic gas in cuprous oxide , cu@xmath0o.@xcite since excitons in cu@xmath0o are strongly bound , their bosonic character persists up to high densities and temperatures and , due to the light masses of particles , their condensate form is expected at appealingly high temperatures .",
    "cuprous oxide exhibits a number of exciton series , the lowest of which is the so - called yellow series just below the fundamental band gap , which by itself is again subdivided into the ortho- ( @xmath1 ) and para - exciton ( @xmath2 ) series.@xcite up to recently , research has mainly focused on the triply degenerate optically active orthoexciton gas in cuprous oxide@xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that the lifetime of the orthoexciton , which is intrinsically limited by down - conversion to the lower lying paraexciton state , is too short to reach the condensed state@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lifetime for the paraexciton state , which is not optically active , is expected to be long .",
    "the exact value for the paraexciton lifetime varies widely from of nanoseconds to milliseconds @xcite depending strongly on the quality of the sample , i.e. , on the efficiency of nonradiative processes determined by impurity and defect concentration .",
    "significant population of the paraexciton state can be achieved via laser pumping of higher - energy , optically - active states and the subsequent efficient relaxation processes toward the lowest singlet state .",
    "advantageous on one side , the optical darkness of excitons at singlet state does not , however , allow to easily probe their properties and this has been one of the main obstacles in searching of their possible condensate form .    although direct optical absorption and emission to and from the paraexciton ground state are strictly forbidden , paraexcitons can radiatively decay with the assistance of @xmath3 phonon , @xcite . in this process",
    "the spin - flip is allowed by spin - orbit - lattice interaction .",
    "unfortunately , the radiation efficiency is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the orthoexcitons , requiring long integration time to detect the emission .",
    "therefore one has to rely on alternative methods to study the properties of the paraexcitons .",
    "one of the methods pursued so far has been to study the optically allowed inter - exciton transitions ( similar to the lyman series in the hydrogen spectrum ) , @xcite .",
    "although one can easily extract basic parameters such as the effective mass and the lifetime of paraexcitons , it is more difficult to gain information on the statistical properties of the exciton gas from these kind of experiments . a second method is to break the symmetry , thereby optically activating direct and phonon - assisted transitions to and from the paraexcitonic ground state .",
    "there are many ways to break this symmetry , including applying pressure @xcite and applying electric fields @xcite .",
    "these strong perturbations typically lead to a considerably reduced lifetime of the paraexciton @xcite .",
    "application of a magnetic field breaks the symmetry in a more subtle way . in this case , the optically forbidden paraexciton state mixes with the quadruple allowed orthoexciton state , leading to weak para - exciton emission , which intensity is quadratic in the field , and a negligible influence on the lifetime .",
    "early studies already uncovered paraexciton magneto - luminescence @xcite , although due to the relatively low magnetic fields , and the chosen crystal orientation these experiments did not allow for a detailed field dependent study nor for a study of the statistical properties of the para - exciton gas .",
    "more recently , the optically forbidden paraexcitons were observed in fields up to 10 t , in this work the authors used the resonant excitation to create an initially cold paraexciton gas .",
    "in addition , these authors observed a surprisingly narrow para - exciton magneto - absorption line . @xcite .    in this paper we show that application of sufficiently high magnetic fields is a non - invasive and subtle tool to activate both the direct and phonon - assisted emission of the initially dark paraexcitons in cu@xmath0o .",
    "the observation of phonon - assisted emission provides a direct tool to probe the thermodynamical properties of paraexcitons gas in cu@xmath0o , and eventually the appearance of its possible condensate phase .",
    "in the present work , the paraexciton magneto - luminescence has been studied in a faraday geometry with magnetic fields up to @xmath4  t at a temperature of @xmath5  k. this geometry was chosen to optimize both the degree of polarization , as well as the emission efficiency @xcite . for the steady state experiments , platelets",

    "the circular polarized magneto - luminescence spectra were detected using monochromator ( resolution 0.02 nm ) equipped with a ln@xmath0 cooled ccd camera . since the paraexciton lifetime of sample i was found to be less than 30 ns , indicating the presence of impurities , we used a [ 110 ] oriented 250  @xmath6 m thick platelet of cut and polished from a high purity cu@xmath0o natural crystal ( denoted below as sample ii ) for the time - resolved experiments . a pulsed solid state laser ( 50 ns , 4 khz repetition rate , 523 nm , 0.6 mj/@xmath7 ) was used as an excitation source .",

    "as expected , the @xmath8  t luminescence spectrum is dominated by orthoexcitonic features . apart from the quadrupole allowed direct orthoexciton transition ( @xmath16 at 2.033 ev ) , there are clear lines from phonon - assisted transitions involving @xmath17 ( @xmath18 at 6.6 mev ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 at 13.2 mev ) , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 at 18.2 mev ) phonons @xcite .",
    "in addition to these strong orthoexcitonic features , also a very weak emission originating from phonon assisted ( @xmath23 ) paraexciton decay is observed at 2.011 ev.@xcite the presence of a magnetic field leads to two important changes in the spectra .",
    "first , the threefold degeneracy of the triplet ortho - exciton state is lifted leading to a splitting of the ortho - exciton derived bands ( labeled o@xmath24 in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath25 spectra show predominantly the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components , respectively .",
    "second , and more interestingly for the present work , a number of emission features appear in the spectra , which are not polarized .",
    "the sharp feature at 2.0216 ev originates from direct emission from the para - exciton 1s to the ground state ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , like for the ortho - exciton , three phonon - assisted paraexciton recombination lines are observed at 2.011 ev ( p@xmath10 , @xmath17 phonon ) , 2.083 ev ( p@xmath0 , @xmath19 ) and 2.045 ev ( p@xmath11 , @xmath21 ) , respectively . as is the case for orthoexcitons",
    ", these latter emission lines may provide information on the statistical properties of the optically excited paraexciton gas . before turning to these properties ,",
    "we first discuss some of the more general features of the para- and ortho - exciton emission .",
    "the reason that the paraexciton lines are activated in a magnetic field is the presence of the perturbing zeeman term in the electron - hole hamiltonian : @xmath29 leading to a mixing of the singlet para - exciton state @xmath30 with the @xmath31 triplet ortho - exciton state @xmath32 .",
    "the perturbed singlet state becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the electron ( hole ) @xmath36-factor , @xmath37 the bohr magneton , and @xmath38  mev the energy difference between the ortho- and paraexciton ground states .",
    "this mixing leads to a non - zero para - exciton luminescence intensity , which in the limit @xmath39 , as is the case in the experiments , will be proportional to the square of the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , since the mixing occurs with the @xmath31 state only , one expects a linear polarization for the paraexciton emission .",
    "experimentally , these features are indeed observed , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) and b ) : there is no difference in para - exciton emission intensity for @xmath14 and @xmath25 polarized spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , and the intensity is indeed quadratic in fields up to 32 t ( fig .  [ fig2]b )    k , @xmath4  t ( sample i ) .",
    "p@xmath10-p@xmath11 refer to @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 phonon assisted transitions , respectively .",
    "( b ) intensity of the @xmath12- phonon - assisted paraexciton emission ( closed circles ) and direct paraexciton emission ( open circles ) as a function of the squared magnetic field .",
    "[ fig2],width=302 ]    a second consequence of the mixing is that the energies of the states involved show a diamagnetic shift .",
    "the field dependent energy of the paraexciton state is given by @xmath40 in the same low field limit as before , this reduces to @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the energy of the @xmath31 orthoexciton state is expected to shift to higher energy by the same amount .",
    "these diamagnetic shifts are nicely demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows a two dimensional false color map of the ortho- and para - exciton emission intensity as a function of energy and field . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the single @xmath42 ortho emission line observed at @xmath8  t splits into its @xmath43 components ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the same holds for the phonon assisted ortho - exciton lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "while the @xmath26 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath25 ) lines show their expected linear zeeman splitting , the energy of the @xmath31 line indeed increases quadratically with increasing field . in line with this ,",
    "the para - exciton line shows , once observable , a quadratically deceasing energy upon increasing field ( fig .  [ fig3]b )",
    "however , even though eq .",
    "[ equ3 ] predicts equal size shifts for the ortho- and paraexcitons , the shift for the ortho - exciton at @xmath4  t ( 0.31 mev ) is about half of the value observed for the paraexciton ( 0.57 mev ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is presently not clear , although it has been suggested that it is due to the interaction of the orthoexciton with higher lying levels@xcite .    in principle",
    "one can extract the values of the electron and hole @xmath44factors from the observed energy shifts , @xcite .",
    "assuming that the paraexciton indeed shifts according to eq .",
    "[ equ3 ] leads to the relation @xmath45 .",
    "an independent relation can be obtained from the observed zeeman splitting , shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , yielding @xmath46 .",

    "the drawn light grey line in fig .",

    "[ equ5 ] to the data using the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the parameter extracted from the fit is an exciton gas temperature @xmath60  k. one important parameter one would like to extract from the experiment is the density of excited paraexcitons .",
    "a straightforward , though inaccurate , method is to assume that each absorbed photon creates exactly one exciton , which is then allowed to diffuse throughout the sample volume .",
    "assuming that 50% of the incident photons were absorbed , for the current experimental conditions and given parameters , as penetration depth of 100 @xmath6 m @xcite , this yields a upper limit for the density of @xmath6110@xmath62 @xmath63 . in principle , one could analyze the luminescence line shape using the bose - einstein distribution , i.e. assuming quantum statistics , and from the extracted gas temperature and chemical potential calculate the density .",
    "the legitimacy of this analysis , in particular use of bose - einstein distribution function , has , however , been questioned in @xcite .",
    "it is suggested , that auger processes might lead to an overestimation of the exciton density and that the competition between auger recombination and cooling of the phonon - emission could possibly result in a bose - like distribution. to avoid this problem , the current experiments have been performed at moderate excitation densities , where auger processes are playing only a minor role .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows the excitation power dependence of the intensity of the phonon - assisted paraexciton emission at @xmath49  t. for low powers the emission scales linearly with the excitation power .",
    "the influence of auger processes is observed only for excitation power densities exceeding 0.8 w/@xmath7 , where the intensity shows the typical sub - linear behavior with increasing power .",
    "similar results were observed in @xcite for the orthoexciton luminescence : the intensity increases by the square root of the excitation density . in present experiments ,",
    "the used incident power had a value well below auger regime ( 0.4 w/@xmath7 ) ensuring that auger process play a minor role only .",
    "a convolution of eq.4 using quantum statistics has also been fitted to the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( black curve ) .",
    "the parameter extracted from the fit are an exciton gas temperature @xmath64  k and a chemical potential @xmath52  mev . for the exciton gas to be truly in the quantum limit",
    ", the density has to be higher than or at least comparable to the quantum density @xmath65 . for a para - exciton gas at 8 k",
    "this means a density of @xmath66  @xmath63 . using the obtained chemical potential and temperature extracted from the fit",
    ", the calculated density of the exciton gas gives an upper estimate of @xmath67  @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ much smaller than the quantum density .",
    "therefore , the conclusion for the present experiments is that the exciton gas is still in the classical limit , and one has to go to much lower temperature or higher densities to reach the quantum limit .",
    "in addition to the above described continuous wave experiments , we have also performed time resolved experiments to elucidate the dynamics of the paraexciton gas .",
    "sample ii was used for these experiments since it shows a relatively long paraexciton lifetime .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) shows some typical time - resolved magneto - luminescence spectra at @xmath5  k , @xmath68  t. at early times , the spectrum shows the clear presence of both ortho- and paraexcitons .",
    "as expected , the orthoexcitonic features vanish rapidly due to ortho - to - paraexciton conversion . in contrast",
    ", the paraexcitons have a fairly long lifetime even at these high fields . the observed decay is clearly not mono - exponential , as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig5](b ) .",
    "it reveals a fairly complicated behavior . there is a fast initial decay which closely follows the pump pulse profile ( 60 ns ) .",
    "directly after the pump pulse , a fast decay occurs with a time constant of @xmath61250 ns leading to a reduction of the density by about two orders of magnitude within the first 600 ns .",
    "this decay is most likely due to the collision - induced non - radiative decay process.@xcite this is in line with the high power density used in this experiment .",
    "a simple estimate yields an upper limit for the initial density of about 10@xmath69 @xmath63 , which is well within the auger regime . finally after 600 ns auger processes do not play an essential role anymore ( the density dropped below 10@xmath70 @xmath63 ) , and the luminescence intensity slowly decays further with a time constant of around 1@xmath6s , mainly limited by the purity of the sample .    using the method described above , one can again extract an estimate of the gas temperature ( using a classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution function ) as a function of time after excitation .",
    "the evolution of the estimated paraexciton gas temperature presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that there is a fast initial cooling with a time constant of 270 ns .",
    "this decay time is comparable to that observed for the intensity decay , suggesting that also for the cooling auger processes play a dominant role .",
    "after about 500 ns the gas has cooled down to about 2 k. this temperature corresponds to the bath temperature , meaning that the gas reachs thermodynamical equiibrium at these times .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the magneto - optical properties of the yellow exciton series in cuprous oxide in magnetic fields up to 32 t .",
    "we observed the direct emission of the normally optically inactive paraexciton arising from mixing of the 1s paraexciton state with the 1s @xmath31 orthoexciton state .",
    "the experimental results can be well explained using first order perturbation theory . due to the gentle breaking of the symmetry by the magnetic field ,",
    "the lifetime of excitons is only weakly affected allowing efficient thermalization of the exciton gas .",
    "besides the direct emission of the paraexciton , we also observe 3 additional lines which we are assigned to phonon - assisted emission processes from the paraexciton state , involving various phonons of different symmetries , similar to the orthoexciton case . these lines provide a unique opportunity for direct determination of the thermodynamical properties of the paraexciton gas . for the present experiments ,",
    "it is clear that the density of the exciton gas is well below the quantum density .",
    "the time evolution of the gas parameters , obtained from time - resolved experiments are calling for further experimental efforts at higher exciton densities and lower temperatures , preferably in a confined environment to avoid diffusion , to solve the enigma of bec in cu@xmath0o .",
