    "how gas is accreted onto dark matter halos , its thermal history , how it is turned into stars , and if , how and when such star formation is quenched can not be reliably predicted from first principles .",
    "the physical processes that are involved are too complex and non linear , with hydrodynamic simulations failing by a large margin to cover the extremely wide dynamical range that would be required to describe phenomena ranging from the formation of stars and supermassive black holes to the behaviour of multiphase gas on megaparsec scales . where it is hard to progress with pure theory alone , observations can help and lead to further advances in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve . indeed , over the last two decades",
    "a wealth of multiwavelength observations from both ground and space facilities have provided us with a rich vision of the galaxy populations in the high redshift universe .",
    "once correctly interpreted , such photometric , spectroscopic , and high spatial resolution data can provide us with estimates of stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) and star formation history ( sfh ) , structure , dynamics and nuclear activity , for a very large number of galaxies , and do so as a function of redshift and environment .    in particular",
    ", the accurate measurement of stellar mass and sfr is critical for trying to establish the evolutionary links connecting galaxy populations at one redshift with those at another redshift . setting constraints on the previous sfh of individual galaxies is also relevant in this context .",
    "all this is currently obtained by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of synthetic stellar populations to the sed of galaxies from their multi - band photometry . in practice , a large set of template synthetic seds is constructed with different sfhs , extinctions and metallicities , and a best fit is sought by picking the sfh that minimises the @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on star forming galaxies at @xmath6 , hence covering the epoch of major star formation activity , and explore a wide set of sfhs showing advantages and disadvantages of different parameterizations of them .",
    "the case of passively evolving galaxies at @xmath7 was already addressed in maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "it is well known that at @xmath2 galaxies with sfrs as high as a few @xmath8 are quite common ( e.g. , daddi et al . 2005 ) , and by analogy with the rare objects at @xmath9 with similar sfrs ( like ultra luminous infra - red galaxies , ulirgs ) , it was widely believed that such galaxies were caught in a merging - driven starburst . however ,",
    "integral - field near - infrared spectroscopy has revealed that at least some of these galaxies have ordered , rotating velocity fields with no kinematic evidence for ongoing merging ( genzel et al .",
    "still , the disk was shown to harbour several star - forming clumps and to have high velocity dispersion and gas fraction .",
    "all this makes such disk quite different from local disk galaxies , and it is now well documented that the same properties apply to many similar objects at @xmath2 ( frster - schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "that high sfrs in @xmath2 galaxies do not necessarily imply _ starburst _ activity became clear from a study of galaxies in the goods fields ( daddi et al .",
    "indeed , for starforming galaxies at @xmath6 the sfr tightly correlates with stellar mass ( with sfr @xmath10 ) , with small dispersion ( @xmath11 dex ) , as shown in figure  [ sfrm ] .",
    "only a few galaxies lie far away from the correlation : a relatively small number of passive galaxies ( with undetectable sfr , not shown in the figure ) , and sub - mm galaxies ( smg ) with much higher sfrs , which may indeed be the result of gas - rich major mergers . among starforming galaxies",
    ", the small dispersion of the sfr for given @xmath4 demonstrates that these objects can not have been caught in a special , starburst moment of their existence .",
    "rather , they must sustain such high sfrs for a major fraction of the time interval between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , i.e. for some @xmath14 gyr , instead of the order of one dynamical time ( @xmath15 yr ) typical of starbursts .",
    "similar correlations have also been found at lower redshifts , notably at @xmath16 ( elbaz et al .",

    "beyond @xmath22 ( @xmath23 gyr ) the specific sfr (= sfr/@xmath4 ) appears to flatten out and remain constant all the way to very high redshifts ( daddi et al .",
    "2009 ; stark et al . 2009 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in parallel with these observational evidences",
    ", theorists are shifting their interests from ( major ) mergers as the main mechanism to grow galaxies , to continuous _ cold stream _ accretion of baryons , that are then turned into stars in a quasi - steady fashion ( e.g. , dekel et al .",
    "clearly , a continuous , albeit fluctuating sfr such as in these cold stream models provides a far better match to the observed tight sfr@xmath24 relation , compared to a scenario in which star formation proceeds through a series of short starbursts interleaved by long periods of reduced activity .",
    "this is not to say that major mergers do not play a role .",
    "they certainly exist , and can lead to real giant starbursts bringing galaxies to sfrs as high as @xmath25 , currently identified with smgs ( e.g. tacconi et al .",
    "2008 ; menendez - delmestre et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "deriving sfrs , ages , stellar masses , etc . from sed",
    "fitting requires making assumptions on the previous sfh of galaxies .",
    "a widespread approach is to fit the sed of galaxies at low as well as high redshifts with so called  @xmath0-models \" , i.e. , synthetic seds in which the sfh is described by an exponentially declining sfr , starting at cosmic time @xmath26 , i.e. : @xmath27 where @xmath28sfr(@xmath29 ) . for a galaxy at cosmic time @xmath21 a @xmath30 fit then gives the age ( i.e. , @xmath31 , the time elapsed since the beginning of star formation ) , the sfr e - folding time @xmath0 , the reddening @xmath32 , the metallicity @xmath33 and finally the stellar mass @xmath4 via the scale factor @xmath34 .",
    "the sfr then follows from equation ( 2 ) , where @xmath21 is the cosmic time corresponding to the observed redshift of each galaxy . of course , the reliability of the results depends on the extent to which the actual sfh is well represented by a declining exponential .",
    "it is worth recalling that the first applications of @xmath0-models were to figure out the ages of local elliptical galaxies , and the typical result was that the age is of the order of one hubble time , and @xmath0 of the order of 1 gyr or less ( e.g. , bruzual 1983 ) .",
    "this approach confirmed that the bulk of stars in local ellipticals are very old , hence formed within a short time interval compared to the present hubble time .",
    "later , the usage of @xmath0-models was widely extended also to actively star forming galaxies at virtually all redshifts , to the extent that it became the default assumption in this kind of studies ( e.g. , papovich et al . 2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "2005 ; lee et al .",
    "2009 ; pozzetti et al . 2009 ; fster - schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ; wuyts et al .",
    ". such an assumed sfh may give reasonable results for local spirals , as their sf activity has been secularly declining for an order of one hubble time ( e.g. , kennicutt 1986 ) , but we shall argue that it may be a rather poor representation of the sfh of high-@xmath35 galaxies , and may lead to quite unphysical results .",
    "cimatti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) noted that the age of elliptical galaxies at @xmath36 turns out to be @xmath37 gyr both when using only the rest - frame uv part of the sed , and when using the whole optical - to - near - ir sed in conjunction with @xmath0-models .",
    "however , they also noted that the former `` age '' is actually the age of the population formed in the last significant episode of star formation , while the latter `` age '' corresponds to the time elapsed since the beginning of star formation .",
    "the near equality of these two ages suggests that the sfr peaked shortly before being quenched , rather than having peaked at an earlier time and having declined ever since .",
    "moreover , using @xmath0 models one implicitly assumes that galaxies are all caught at their minimum sfr , which is possibly justified for local ellipticals and spirals , but not necessarily for star - forming galaxies at high redshifts that may actually be at the peak of their sf activity .",
    "indeed , an integration of @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by equation ( 1 ) shows that the sfr can _ increase _ quasi - exponentially with time before the effect of the declining term @xmath40 takes over , or star formation is suddenly quenched and the galaxy turns passive ( renzini 2009 ) .",
    "mass and sfr formally increase exponentially when sfr @xmath41 , independent of time , as appears to be the case for @xmath42 ( gonzales et al .",
    "thus , the observations of both passive and star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 suggest that the sfrs of these galaxies may well have increased with time , rather than decreased . for these reasons , in this paper we use both _",
    "direct_-@xmath0 models , with the sfr given by equation ( 2 ) , as well as _ inverted_-@xmath0 models in which the sfr increases exponentially with time , i.e. : @xmath43    thus , direct-@xmath0 models assume that galaxies are caught at their minimum sfr and had their maximum sfr at the beginning , whereas inverted-@xmath0 models assume that galaxies are caught at their maximum sfr and had their minimum sfr at the beginning .",
    "these two extreme assumptions may to some extent _ bracket _ the actual sfhs of real galaxies , or at least of the majority of them which , because of the tight sfr@xmath24 relation , must have a relatively smooth sfh . here",
    "we explore which of the two assumptions gives the better fit to the sed of @xmath2 galaxies , and discuss the astrophysical plausibility of the relative results . besides these exponential sfhs we also consider the case of constant sfrs . in principle ,",
    "other , differently motivated sfhs could also be explored , but in this paper we restrict the comparison to these three simple options , with sfrs increasing with time , decreasing , or constant .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 provides information on the galaxy data base that is used for our sed fitting experiments .",
    "section 3 illustrates the procedure of sed fitting and describes the models .",
    "section 4 presents the results we obtain for the different star formation history templates and their comparisons .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a general discussion and presents our conclusions .",
    "finally , we adopt a cosmology with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and + @xmath46 equal to 0.7 , 0.3 and 0.75 , respectively , for consistency with most previous works .",
    "the age of the best - fit model is required to be lower than the age of the universe at the given spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the sfr and masses are always in @xmath19/yr and @xmath19 units , respectively .",
    "we use a sample of 96 galaxies in the goods - south field from daddi et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "these galaxies were selected via the @xmath47  diagram ( daddi et al . 2004 ) to be star forming , as confirmed by the detection in deep spitzer+mips data at @xmath48 m for @xmath49% of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "we include only objects with accurately determined spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath50 , which were derived from a variety of surveys ( see daddi et al .",
    "2007a for references ) , including notably ultra - deep spectroscopy from the gmass project(j .",
    "kurk et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) and from the goods survey at the very large telescope ( vanzella et al . 2008 ; popesso et al .",
    "galaxies in the resulting sample lie in the range @xmath51 .",
    "the multicolour photometry was obtained using the 4 bands hst+acs data in the optical ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , the jhk bands in the near - ir from vlt+isaac observations ( retzlaff et al . 2010 ) and from spitzer+irac ( dickinson et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "we used psf - matched images to build photometric catalogues from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the irac photometry was measured over 4@xmath54 diameter apertures and corrected to total magnitudes using corrections appropriate for point sources , and matched to the @xmath53 band using total @xmath53-band magnitudes as a comparison .",
    "this is the same procedure that was used for the goods - s catalogues presented by cimatti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and daddi et al .",
    "( 2007a ) . in summary ,",
    "all sed fits make use of the following bands : @xmath55 plus the spitzer / irac channels 1 , 2 and 3 .    besides satisfying the @xmath47 criterion ,",
    "the sample of galaxies used in this paper is subject to the additional selection imposed by the various spectroscopic surveys mentioned above .",
    "figure  [ histo3 ] shows the distribution functions of the mass , sfr , and reddening , as derived by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , separately for the full @xmath56 sample in the goods - south field , and for the sub - sample of 96 objects with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the sample used here is somewhat biased towards higher masses , sfrs , and extinctions , but by and large for all three quantities it covers a major fraction of the range exhibited by the full sample .",
    "this can also be appreciated by inspecting figure  [ sfrm ] , where the 96 galaxies used in the present study are compared to the whole sample in daddi et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "therefore , we consider that the conclusions drawn from this spectroscopic sample should hold for the full sample , perhaps with the exclusion of some low mass , low sfr objects .",
    "this database allows the sampling of galaxy seds up to the rest - frame @xmath53 band .",
    "the seds over the whole wavelength range from the rest - frame @xmath57 to the @xmath53 band will be analysed in the next sections .",
    "the method we adopt for the sed fitting is similar to the one used in maraston et al .",
    "we construct composite population templates based on the stellar population models of maraston  ( 2005 ) and we use an adapted version of the code _ hyper - z _ ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) , in which the sed fitting is performed at fixed spectroscopic redshift .",
    "we use an updated version of hyper-@xmath33 , kindly provided to us by m. bolzonella , in which 221 ages ( or @xmath0 s ) are used for each kind of sfh , instead of the 51 used in earlier versions .",
    "the use of denser grids tends to give somewhat different results , an effect that is explored in detail in a parallel paper ( j. pforr et al . in preparation ) .",
    "it is important to note that the code does not interpolate on the template grids , hence the template set must be densely populated .",
    "the fitting procedure is based on maximum - likelihood algorithms and the goodness of the fit is quantified via the @xmath5 statistics .",
    "the code computes @xmath5 for a large number of templates , which differ for sfhs , and finds the best - fitting template among them , having the reddening @xmath32 as an additional free parameter .",
    "it is important to note that the code does not interpolate on the template grids , hence the template set must be densely populated .",
    "the extinction @xmath58 is allowed to vary from 0 to 3 in steps of 0.2 , which corresponds to @xmath32 from 0 to 0.74 according to the reddening law of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that we adopt for all fits .",
    "by doing so we implicitly assume that the dust composition is the same in all examined galaxies and that there are no major galaxy to galaxy differences in the relative distribution of dust and young , hot stars .",
    "differences in the extinction curve have been detected among @xmath2 galaxies , with some galaxies exhibiting the 2175   uv bump , while others not showing it ( noll et al .",
    "2009 ) , but such differences appear to have only minor effects on the derived sfr .",
    "extinction is unlikely to be uniform across the surface of galaxies , particularly in extremely dusty ones ( e.g. , serjeant , gruppioni & oliver 2002 ) .",
    "however , the tightness of the sfr - mass relation for @xmath2 galaxies ( cf .",
    "1 ) , together with the agreement of their uv - derived sfrs with those derived from the radio ( pannella et al .",
    "2009 ) argues for such _ average extinction _ approximation to be a fairly good one , at least for the majority of the galaxies at these redshifts .    for all models we considered only solar metallicity .",
    "this is different from the approach adopted by maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in fitting the near - passive galaxies at @xmath59 , for which we considered four metallicities and several possible reddening laws .",
    "indeed , we have noticed that varying the reddening law has only a very mild influence on the derived properties of star - forning galaxies , hence for economy we decided to stick to the reddening law that gives the best - fit in most cases , which is the calzetti law .",
    "as for the metallicity , it is known that super - solar metallicities tend to give younger ages and higher masses and vice - versa for sub - solar metallicities ( e.g. , maraston 2005 ) .",
    "however , metallicity effects do not change the main results of the present investigation .",
    "indeed , our focus is on exploring the effects of adopting different functional forms for the sfhs and we restrict the main analysis at fixed , solar metallicity . on the other hand , metallicity effects over the sed of star forming galaxies are generally less important than age effects .    the main difference with respect to maraston et al . ( 2006 ) , which was focused on nearly - passive galaxies , consists in the composite population templates that are used in the fits . in particular , besides a constant star formation and direct-@xmath0 models , we explore inverted-@xmath0 models for various setups of ages and @xmath0 s .",
    "the latter models are quite a novelty in this kind of studies , and we describe them in more detail below .      as mentioned above , besides constant sfr models , in this paper we consider two main sets of sfhs , namely direct-@xmath0 and inverted-@xmath0 models , where the evolution of the sfr is given by equation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively . for both types of sfhs",
    ", we calculate three model flavours which mostly differ with respect to how the parameter age is treated , namely :    \\a ) leaving the age as a free parameter ;    \\b ) fixing the age by fixing the formation redshift and varying only @xmath0 ;    \\c ) constraining the age to be larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the age of composite models is the time elapsed since the beginning of star formation , i.e. is the age of the oldest stars @xmath60 . in the age free case",
    ", we simply compute exponentially increasing / decreasing models for various @xmath0 s , and 221 ages for each @xmath0 .",
    "the sed fit with these age - free models releases for each galaxy a value of age @xmath61 , @xmath32 , @xmath4 and of @xmath0 .    in the case of fixed age",
    "( case b ) , we assume that all galaxies started to form stars at the same redshift @xmath62 , and therefore the age of a galaxy follows from the cosmic time difference between its individual spectroscopic redshift and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , in this case the best fit releases a value of @xmath0 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 . in this experiment",
    "we take @xmath63 for the formation redshift , which implies that all galaxies are older than @xmath64 1 gyr ( ages range between 1 and 3 gyr , depending on their redshift ) .    in case",
    "c ) the age can still vary freely , but only within values that exceed the corresponding @xmath0 , so e.g. when @xmath0  is 0.5 gyr , the allowed ages for the fit must be @xmath65 gyr .",
    "in practice , among all the fits attempted for case a ) those with age @xmath66 are not considered .",
    "age is a default free parameter in hyper-@xmath33 , and therefore the procedure had to be modified to cope with case b ) , for which age is no longer a free parameter .",
    "thus , for each age we have calculated a grid of models for 221 different @xmath0 s ranging from 0.05 to 10.3 gyr in step of 0.045 gyr , although the cases with @xmath67 gyr will be discussed separately .",
    "the best - fit then finds the preferred @xmath0 .",
    "if we were to consider all kinds of galaxies , including passive galaxies and low - redshift ones , the exponentially - increasing models should be quenched at some point , which could be done either by sfr truncation , or adding a further exponential decline .",
    "we did not quench the models here as the galaxies we focus on are all actively starforming at the epoch of observation .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the set - up with fixed age clearly has one degree of freedom less than those with age free , which will affect their @xmath5 values .",
    "the quality of the fits is measured , as usual , by their reduced @xmath30 , but we believe that the plausibility of the fits can be assessed only considering the broadest possible astrophysical context . before presenting our results it is worth adding some final comments on the derived stellar masses and sfrs . in this work",
    "we have used templates adopting a straight salpeter imf down to 0.1 @xmath68 .",
    "this is not the optimal choice as it is generally agreed that an imf with a flatter slope or cut - off at low masses , like those proposed by kroupa ( 2001 ) or chabrier ( 2003 ) , is more appropriate for deriving an absolute value of the stellar mass or of the sfr .",
    "however , the focus of this work is in comparing the results obtained with different sfhs , hence the slope of the imf below @xmath69 is irrelevant .",
    "note also that the reported stellar mass @xmath70 is the mass that went into stars by the age of the galaxy .",
    "this overestimates the true stellar mass , as stars die leaving remnants whose mass is smaller than the initial one , and the galaxy mass decrement in case of extended star formation histories is @xmath71 ( see e.g. , maraston 1998 ; maraston et al .",
    "in this section we compare the stellar population properties derived under the three different assumptions for the sfh , namely : direct- and inverted-@xmath0 models and constant star formation , both leaving age as a free parameter , and also assuming age ( i.e. , formation redshift ) as a prior , as described above .",
    "a first set of best fits was performed allowing the procedure to select the preferred galaxy age .",
    "the results are reported in figures 3 to 8 , showing the histograms for the resulting ages , @xmath0 s , stellar masses , reddening , sfrs and reduced @xmath30 , respectively .",

    "similar plots could be shown using ages derived from direct-@xmath0 models or models with sfr = const .",
    "[ zzform],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    surprisingly , all histograms look quite similar , irrespective of the adopted sfh . in particular , the distributions of the reduced @xmath30 values are almost identical , indicating that no adopted functional shape of the sfh gives substantially better fits than another .",
    "however , it would be premature to conclude that the resulting physical quantities ( ages , masses , etc . )",
    "have been reliably determined .",
    "most of the derived ages are indeed very short in all three cases , with the majority of them being less than @xmath72 yr , with several galaxies appearing as young as just @xmath73 yr ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we believe that these ages - intended to indicate the epoch at which the star formation started - can not be trusted as such , for the following reasons .",
    "first , as we shall show later and as also known in the literature , the latest episode of star formation outshines older stars even when composite models are considered .",
    "in addition , cosmological arguments render this interpretation suspicious , as we are going to discuss .",
    "figure  [ zzform ] shows the redshift of each individual galaxy as a function of its formation redshift , the latter being derived by combing the redshift and age of each galaxy .",
    "note that with the derived ages most galaxies would have started to form stars just shortly before we happen to observe them .",
    "if this were true , the implied cosmic sfr should rapidly vanish by @xmath74 , while this is far from happening : the cosmic sfr at @xmath74 is nearly as high as it is at @xmath2 ( e.g. , hopkins & beacom 2006 ) , and the specific sfr at a given mass stays at the same high level all the way to @xmath75 ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we consider far more likely that most of the descendants of galaxies responsible for the bulk of cosmic star formation at @xmath76 are to be found among the still most actively star forming galaxies at @xmath2 , rather than a scenario in which the former galaxies would have faded to unobservability by @xmath2 , and those we see at @xmath2 would have no counterpart at @xmath76 .",
    "in other words , massive star forming galaxies at @xmath2 must have started to form stars at redshifts well beyond @xmath77 .",
    "note that some star forming galaxy at @xmath76 may have turned passive by @xmath2 , but the number and mass density of passive galaxies at @xmath2 is much lower than that of @xmath76 star forming galaxies of similar mass ( e.g. kong et al .",
    "2006 ; fontana et al . 2009 ; williams et al . 2009 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2009b ) .",
    "thus , the question is why does the best fit procedure choose such short ages ?",
    "clearly , the result is not completely unrealistic , as the bulk of the light must indeed come from very young stars .",
    "this is illustrated by the example shown in figure  [ sedfit ] , for a typical case in which very short ages are returned .",
    "the main age - sensitive feature in the spectrum is the balmer break , which for this galaxy as for most others in the sample , is rather weak or absent . with the whole optical - to - near - ir sed being dominated by the stars having formed in the recent past",
    ", the spectrum does not convey much age information at all .",
    "figure  [ sedfit ] , lower / left panel , shows that if one forces age to be as large as 1.5 gyr ( and fix the formation redshift accordingly ) , then the balmer break deepens , and the @xmath5 worsens .",
    "figure  [ sedfit457 ] shows the sed and relative best fit spectra for one of the few galaxies for which the procedure indicates a large age ( @xmath37 gyr ) .",
    "clearly , this larger age follows from the much stronger balmer break present in this galaxy .",
    "note that for both direct- and inverted-@xmath0 models , in most cases @xmath78 , i.e. , the e - folding time of sfr is ( much ) longer than the age , i.e. , the sfr does not change much within the time interval @xmath31 .",
    "this explains why both kind of models give results so similar to those in which sfr is assumed to be constant .",
    "we shall show in the next subsections that other fits may actually result in more plausible physical solutions , even if they have a _ worse _ @xmath79 .",
    "the extremely young ages and the insensitivity of the fit to different star formation histories when the age is left free should not be so surprising .",
    "they are the consequence of the fact that the very young , massive stars just formed during the last @xmath80 few @xmath81 yr dominate the light at virtually all wavelengths in these actively star forming galaxies , even if they represent a relatively small fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "the capability of a very young population to outshine previous stellar generations is illustrated in figure  [ overshine ] .",

    "the contribution of the young component clearly outshines the old component at all wavelengths , making it difficult to assess the presence and contribution of the latter one , even if it represents half of the total stellar mass .",
    "this plot demonstrates why it is not appropriate to interpret the `` age '' resulting from the previous fits as the time elapsed since the beginning of star formation , as it is formally meant to be in the fitting procedure and as might be suggested by a naive interpretation of the fitting results .",
    "it would instead be better interpreted as the age of the stars producing the bulk of the light . in the next subsection we experiment with a different approach that may circumvent this intrinsic problem and get more robust properties of ( high - redshift ) star - forming galaxies .",
    "clearly massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 can not have started to form stars just shortly before we observe them .",
    "instead , they must have started long before , as indeed demonstrated by the fact that starforming galaxies are found to much higher redshifts . in this section",
    "we arbitrarily assume that all our galaxies have started to form stars at the same cosmic epoch , corresponding to @xmath82 , i.e. when the universe was @xmath37 gyr old .",
    "this implies an age for the galaxy at redshift @xmath35 which is given by @xmath83 . at first sight",
    "such an assumption may seem a very strong one .",
    "actually this is not the case .",
    "we have already argued that our galaxies must have started to form stars at a redshift much higher than that at which they are observed , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the prior age changes only marginally ( few percent ) if instead of @xmath85 we had chosen @xmath86 , 7 , or more , and so does the result of the fit , i.e. , such result is fairly insensitive to the precise value of @xmath62 , provided it is well in excess of @xmath87 .",
    "obviously , the effect is especially strong for exponentially increasing sfrs .",
    "incidentally , we note that exponentially decreasing sfrs have been assumed also for galaxies at very high redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath88 ; stark et al .",

    "figure  [ sfrzf5 ] shows the comparison of the sfrs , with the sfr from inverted-@xmath0 models being systematically higher by @xmath91 dex , and therefore the specific sfr turns out to be systematically higher by @xmath92 dex .",

    "direct-@xmath0 models prefer very large @xmath0 s , up to @xmath93 gyr , which is to say that they prefer nearly constant sfrs . on the contrary ,",
    "inverted-@xmath0 models prefer short @xmath0 s , typically shorter than @xmath91 gyr , hence a sfr that is rapidly increasing with time .",
    "figure  [ tauzf5 ] gives the key to understand the physical origin of the mass and sfr offsets between the two families of models .",
    "being forced to put more mass at early times , direct-@xmath0 models pick very large @xmath0 s trying to find the best compromise for mass and sfr , and , compared to inverted-@xmath0 models , they overproduce mass at early times and not enough star formation at late times . on the other hand ,",
    "these latter models by construction put very little mass at early times , and most of it is formed at late times . in order to compromise mass and sfr",
    ", they may overestimate the current sfr , and may be forced to hide part of it demanding more extinction .",
    "indeed , figure  [ ebvzf5 ] compares the reddening obtained with the two opposite sfh assumptions , showing that to obtain a good fit in the rest - frame uv the higher ongoing sfr derived from inverted-@xmath0 models needs to be more dust - obscured than in the case of direct-@xmath0 models .",
    "finally , figure  [ chizf5 ] compares the reduced @xmath30 s obtained with the two sets of models . those relative to inverted-@xmath0 models are not very good , but those with direct-@xmath0 models are definitely much worse .",
    "still , a robust choice for the sfh can not rely only on this relatively marginal advantage of inverted-@xmath0 models . in the next subsections",
    "we try to gather independent evidence that may help favouring one or the other option .",
    "the rest - frame uv part of the explored spectrum ( from observed @xmath52 band up to spitzer / irac channel 3 , i.e. , 5.8 @xmath94 m ) is the one which most directly depends on the rate of ongoing star formation . on the other hand , when the sfr is estimated with an sed - fitting procedure as in the previous sections , the derived sfr results from the best - possible compromise with all the free parameters , given the adopted templates .",
    "in other words , the resulting sfr is _ compromised _ relative to the other free parameters of the fit and the adopted sfhs .",
    "sfrs from the uv flux , corrected for extinction using the uv slope ( plus a reddening law , such as the calzetti law , calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) are widely derived in the literature for high redshift galaxies , and shown to be in very good agreement with independent estimates from the radio flux at 1.4 ghz ( e.g. , reddy et al .",
    "2004 ; daddi et al .",
    "2007a , b ; pannella et al .",
    "2009 ) , and also from the mid - ir ( 24 @xmath94 m ) and soft x - ray fluxes , for those galaxies with no mid - ir excess ( daddi et al .",
    "thus , the sfr derived only from the uv flux represents an _ uncompromised _ template ( in the sense that it has no covariance with other parameters of the fit ) , and therefore with respect to which we may gauge the physical plausibility of a _ whole optical - near - ir sed _ fit .",
    "figure  [ sfrebv ] compares the @xmath32 vs. sfr relations that are obtained from sed fittings with various sfhs , to those obtained using only the @xmath57 part of the spectrum .",
    "the latter ones were derived by daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007a ) using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models for converting @xmath95 into sfr , following madau et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath32 is derived by mapping the @xmath96 colour into @xmath32 using the calzetti et al .",
    "note that there are no appreciable differences in the uv between the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and those of maraston ( 2005 ) that are used in this paper .",
    "as clearly shown , the best agreement is between uv - derived sfrs and those obtained from sed fitting with inverted-@xmath0 models and fixed formation redshift .",
    "notice that when leaving age as a free parameter several galaxies are found with exceedingly large sfrs and @xmath32 values ( see also section 4.1 ) , much at variance with the more robust values derived from the uv flux .",
    "direct-@xmath0 models with fixed formation redshift are in better agreement with the uv - derived sfrs , yet they systematically underestimate the sfr as already noticed in section 4.2 .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ sfrcomp ] and figure  [ ebvcomp ] which show the sfr and the reddening @xmath32 from the sed fits directly compared to those from the uv . among all explored sfhs ,",
    "the inverted-@xmath0 models clearly are in best agreement with the values derived from the uv flux and slope .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that the sfhs of inverted-@xmath0 models models are closer to those of real galaxies , compared to the sfhs of direct-@xmath0 models .",
    "it is easy to realise that in galaxies that follow a sfr such as that given by equation ( 1 ) the sfr tends to increase exponentially with time ( pannella et al .",
    "2009 ; renzini 2009 ) .",
    "more precisely , if one ignores the @xmath21 term in this equation the exponential increase proceeds with a @xmath98 gyr .",
    "thus , in this section we present the results of performing a new set of best fits , this time assuming a fixed @xmath0 ( namely @xmath0=0.5 and 1 gyr , that bracket the empirical value ) , leaving age as a free parameter but constraining it to be larger than @xmath0 .",
    "we also consider the case of direct-@xmath0 models with the same parameters and restrictions .",
    "this choice to set limits on age may appear rather artificial , and indeed it is purely meant to avoid the extremely small ages that are found when age is left completely free . in practice , this exercise consists in considering only the cases with age @xmath97 among those already explored in section 4.1 .",
    "the comparison of the sfrs derived from direct- and inverted-@xmath0 models ( figure  [ sfr_agelargertau ] ) is qualitatively similar to the case of fixed formation redshift ( cf .",
    "figure  [ sfrzf5 ] ) , and the same comments apply also here .",
    "the sfr and @xmath32 values that are obtained with these further models are then compared to those obtained from the uv in figures  [ sfrcomp ] and [ ebvcomp ] .",
    "it is apparent that inverted-@xmath0 models with @xmath0=0.5 gyr and ages larger than @xmath0 give results nearly as good as those derived for the case of fixed formation redshift . also",
    "the case of sfr = constant and age @xmath99 0.1 gyr sfrs results in reasonable agreement with those derived from the uv .",
    "all other explored sfhs give results at variance from those obtained from the uv , that we regard as the most robust method to estimate the sfr and reddening .",
    "figure  [ mass_agelargertau ] shows the derived stellar masses . in this parameterisation",
    "there is less difference between the masses that are derived with the age @xmath97 constraint with respect to the case of fixing the formation redshift .",
    "this is due to the fact that direct-@xmath0 models indicate lower masses compared to those in the case of fixed formation redshift , because of their lower age , hence shorter duration of the star formation activity .",
    "note , however , that in most cases the smallest @xmath5 are obtained for the smallest possible age , i.e. , age@xmath100 , or @xmath91 gyr , as shown in figure  [ age_agelargertau ] , again a consequence of the outshining effect .",

    "extinction as a function of wavelength is then applied following the law of calzetti et al .",
    "note that we do not take such mock galaxies as representative of real galaxies .",
    "the goal of the experiment is to show what happens if the sed of a galaxy with a certain sfh is used to derive its sfr and stellar mass using a different sfh .",
    "figures  [ mock1 ] and [ mock2 ] show the results .",

    "the other panels show the _ output _ values , i.e. the sfrs and masses that are obtained by fitting the sed of the mock galaxies with the various templates , as indicated , over - plotted to the input values .",
    "the inverted-@xmath0 models with fixed formation redshift can recover the input quantities strikingly well ( middle panels ) . towards the low - mass end ( @xmath1031.5pt@xmath104 ) the sfr",
    "is somewhat underestimated , suggesting that the assumed start of sf is too early .",
    "note also , as shown by the two middle panels in figure  [ mock1 ] , that the result is almost independent of the assumed formation redshift , as already argued in section 4.2 .",
    "none of the other sfh templates do as well . with the free age mode",
    "a substantial number of outliers with very high sfrs are obtained . the green line in figure  [ mock1 ] and",
    "figure  [ mock2 ] is a fit to the outliers found among the real goods galaxies from the direct-@xmath0 models ( the blue objects in figure  [ sfrcomp ] and figure  [ ebvcomp ] ) , and it is quite instructive to note that when the fit produces wrong values , those follow the same relation of fake values in mock galaxies .",
    "finally , figure  [ mock2 ] , analogous to figure  [ mock1 ] , shows the result of the same experiment with mock galaxies , but now using the template sfhs discussed in the previous subsection , i.e. , with fixed @xmath0 and age @xmath97 .",
    "the inverted-@xmath0 models with age @xmath105 , and @xmath106 gyr give fairly good fits to the actual values in the mock galaxies , but not as good as those with a prior on the formation redshift ( see figure  [ mock1 ] , middle panels ) .",

    "[ age_agelargertau],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the reason why inverted-@xmath0 models fit better is very simple .",
    "most mock galaxies constructed from semi - analytic models exhibit secularly increasing sfrs , as do the cold - stream hydrodynamical models of dekel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as one expects from the empirical sfr - mass relation ( e.g. , renzini 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that quite enough arguments militate in favour of preferring exponentially increasing sfrs , as opposed to decreasing or constant .      as one can notice from figure  [ tauzf5 ] , using inverted-@xmath0 models the vast majority of the best fits tend to cluster close to the minimum allowed value of @xmath0 , i.e. , 0.3 gyr , a limit that was imposed based on the value of @xmath0 implied by the empirical sfr@xmath24 relation , as discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "but what happens if this limit is removed , and the best fit procedure is allowed to chose any value of @xmath0 down to 0.05 gyr ?",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ smalltau ] : several galaxies are now `` best fitted '' with very small @xmath0 s , implying sfhs in which most stars formed just shortly before the time at which the galaxy is observed .",
    "this is to say that leaving the procedure free to choose very small values of @xmath0 results in best fits that closely resemble those obtained with age as a free parameter , that were discussed ( and rejected ) in section 4.1 .",
    "figure  [ smalltau ] shows that also in this case sfrs well in excess of those derived from the uv are derived for several galaxies .",
    "therefore , also inverted-@xmath0 models with unconstrained @xmath0 s suffer from the outshining phenomenon that plagues models with age as a fully unconstrained free parameter .",
    "the lesson we learn from these experiments is that only by setting a prior on age one derives astrophysically more acceptable solutions .",
    "depending on the adopted shape of the sfh , this prior can be a minimum age ( for constant sfr models ) , or setting age@xmath97 ( for direct-@xmath0 models ) , or finally setting a minimum acceptable value for @xmath0 ( for inverted-@xmath0 models ) .",
    "this kind of fix looks quite artificial , and admittedly the resulting procedure is far from being elegant .",
    "it is a simple way of avoiding the outshining effect , and obtain sfrs that are in agreement with those derived from other direct methods , such as from uv , radio , or mid - ir ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2007a , b ; pannella et al 2009 ) .      while sfr and reddening can be best evaluated by just using the uv part of a galaxy s spectrum , the determination of the stellar mass , such a crucial quantity for understanding galaxy evolution , requires the full sed fitting .",
    "hence , it requires exploring a variety of assumed sfhs .",
    "we have shown that there are some adopted sfhs that , constrained to avoid the outshining problem , give sfrs and @xmath32 values in excellent agreement with those derived from the uv .",
    "now , how different are the derived stellar masses when using these viable options for the sfh ? and , ultimately , how much can we trust such derived masses ?    figure  [ masse ] - first and second panel - compares the stellar masses that are derived for the real galaxies studied in this paper using these viable sfhs , namely inverted-@xmath0  with high formation redshift , inverted-@xmath0  with age constrained , and constant sf with age constrained .",
    "the corrensponding masses agree with each other quite well , systematic differences are quite small ( @xmath108 dex ) , and also the scatter is quite modest , of the order of 0.1 dex .",
    "can this consistency suffice to conclude that the adopted procedures give a robust estimate of stellar masses ? in this respect , the fairly accurate recovery of the masses of mock galaxies should increase our confidence .    yet , the problem of outshining remains .",
    "what we consider viable options are sfhs described by extremely simple functions , i.e. , either constant or exponential .",
    "nature certainly realises far more complex sfhs .",
    "for example , an early burst of star formation , followed by a continuous sfr , could be easily missed by the best fit procedure , by remaining out - shined by the successive and ongoing star formation .",
    "thus , we suspect that derived masses may underestimate the actual stellar mass , at least for those galaxies with early massive starbursts .",
    "we note that figure  [ masse ] , third panel compares also the masses derived from direct-@xmath0 models with unconstrained age , to those derived from the viable sfhs .",
    "clearly , such direct-@xmath0 models can substantially underestimate the stellar mass , while they overestimate the sfr ( cf .",
    "figure  [ sfrcomp ] ) .    to conclude this section ,",
    "figure  [ massefinali ] shows the _ absolute _ values of the stellar mass of star - forming galaxies at redshift @xmath109  that are obtained using our preferred star formation history .",
    "we have tried different priors for the sfh of @xmath2 galaxies , and used a @xmath30 best fit approach to derive the basic properties of such galaxies : sfr , stellar mass , reddening , age , etc .",
    "we do not expect that any of the simple mathematical forms adopted for the sfh ( constant sfr , exponentially decreasing , exponentially increasing ) is strictly followed by real galaxies .",
    "we expect , however , that the two opposite choices for the exponential case are sufficiently extreme to encompass the real behavior of galaxies , or at least those having experienced a quasi - steady sfr over most of their lifetime .",
    "we try various tests to distinguish which of the various options is the most acceptable one ( or the least unacceptable ) for giving the astrophysically most plausible values for the basic properties of star forming galaxies in the redshift range between @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we find that by leaving age as a free parameter the best fit procedure delivers implausibly short ages , no matter which sfh template is adopted .",
    "this is so because the sed is dominated by the stars that have formed most recently , and they outshine the older stellar populations that may inhabit these galaxies .",
    "thus , introducing a prior on the beginning of star formation appears to be necessary .    assuming that star formation started at high redshift ( i.e. , @xmath112",
    ", the precise value being almost irrelevant ) provides a more credible framework , with models with exponentially increasing sfr ( that we call inverted-@xmath0 models ) giving systematically higher sfrs for the @xmath2 galaxies in the test sample , and lower stellar masses , compared to models with exponentially decreasing sfr .",
    "these two systematic differences together imply a specific sfr that is a factor of @xmath113 higher in inverted-@xmath0 models , compared to direct-@xmath0 models , when star formation is assumed to start at high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) in both cases .",
    "on the other hand , inverted-@xmath0 models offer various notable advantages : 1 ) they indicate sfrs and extinctions in excellent agreement with those derived from the rest - frame uv part of the sed , which most directly relates to the ongoing star formation and reddening , 2 ) they fairly accurately recover the sfrs and masses of mock galaxies constructed from semi - analytic models , in which sfr are indeed secularly increasing in most cases , and 3 ) have systematically better reduced @xmath30 values compared to models with exponentially decreasing sfrs , though one can not consider them fully satisfactory .",
    "these advantages are somewhat reduced if the best fit procedure is allowed to pick very small values of @xmath0 , down to 0.05 gyr , as in such case derived sfrs tend to be somewhat overestimated compared to those derived from the uv .",
    "we have also explored star formation histories ( such as constant sfr , or exponentially decreasing ) in which age is a priori constrained to avoid very small values ( e.g. , age @xmath114 gyr , or age @xmath97 , or fixed @xmath0 ) .",
    "adopting such priors , though it may seem quite artificial , gives more plausible solutions with respect to cases in which age is left fully free .",
    "this is due to the mentioned outshining effect of very young stellar populations over the older ones .",
    "still , models with exponentially increasing sfrs tend to give systematically better results , as judged from the consistency with the uv derived sfrs .",
    "besides the above arguments , there are other reasons to prefer stellar population models constructed with exponentially increasing sfrs , including :    \\1 ) the almost linear relation between sfr and stellar mass ( sfr @xmath10 ) , and the small scatter about it , that are empirically established for redshift @xmath87 galaxies implies that they can indeed experience a quasi - exponential growth at these cosmic epochs .",
    "later , some process may quench their star formation entirely and turn them into passively evolving _ ellipticals _ , or keep growing until the secular decrease of the specific star formation rate ( the @xmath40 term in equation ( 1 ) ) takes over , and galaxies ( such as spirals ) continue forming stars at a slowly decreasing rate all the way to the present epoch ( renzini 2009 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the direct observation of the evolution of the luminosity function in rest - frame uv ( which is directly related to sfr ) shows that the characteristic luminosity at 1600   ( @xmath115 ) brightens by over one magnitude between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( bouwens et al .",
    "since extinction is likely to increase with time following metal enrichment , the increase of the rest - frame uv luminosity can only be due to an increased sfr in individual galaxies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore which assumptions and procedures are likely to give the most robust estimates of the basic stellar population parameters , when using data that extend from the rest - frame uv to the near - ir .",
    "we argue that ongoing sfrs are best derived at wavelengths below about one micron by using the uv part of the sed of galaxies , and inverted-@xmath0 models give sfrs in excellent agreement with them .",
    "however , the fit to the full optical to near - infrared sed is required to derive the mass in stars .",
    "we show that the sfhs , with a prior on age or @xmath0 to reduce the outshining effect , give results that agree quite well with each other , giving some confidence on the reliability of the derived masses . however , it is still possible that the mass may be somewhat underestimated for those galaxies in which a substantial fraction of the stellar mass was produced in a strong burst , early in their evolution .    goods star - forming galaxies as derived from inverted-@xmath0 models , with @xmath118 and @xmath89  gyr .",
    "[ massefinali],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    at first sight the higher sfrs and lower stellar masses indicated by inverted-@xmath0 models ( compared to direct-@xmath0 models , both with fixed formation redshift ) may exacerbate an apparent mismatch between the _ cosmic _ ( volume averaged ) sfr history ( @xmath119 ) and the empirical stellar mass density ( @xmath120 ) , such that the integration of sfr@xmath121 tends to overproduce the stellar mass density at most / all redshifts ( e.g. , wilkins , trentham & hopkins 2008 ) .",
    "however , sfrs are more often derived from direct sfr indicators , such as the rest - frame uv , radio flux , h@xmath122 flux , or mid / far - infrared , rather than from sed fits .",
    "therefore the 0.5 dex effect on the sfrs relative to the direct-@xmath0 models should not affect this discrepancy .",
    "there may remain the 0.2 dex effect on the masses , but inverted-@xmath0 models , by construction minimising star formation at early times , may systematically underestimate the stellar mass of galaxies , in particular if part of it was formed in early bursts .",
    "thus , with this caveat in mind , the use of inverted-@xmath0 models with fixed formation redshift should not appreciably exacerbate the mismatch problem mentioned above . instead",
    ", direct-@xmath0 models with unconstrained age most certainly worsen this problem as they underestimate the stellar mass ( see figure  [ masse ] , right panel ) , and overestimate the sfr ( see figure  [ sfrcomp ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the use of synthetic stellar populations with an exponentially declining sfr should be avoided in the case of star forming galaxies at redshift beyond @xmath37 . exponentially increasing sfrs , with e - folding times of @xmath123 gyr , and a high starting redshift",
    "appear to provide astrophysically more plausible results , and while nature may not closely follow such a simple functional behavior , they should be preferred in deriving sfrs and stellar masses of high redshift galaxies .",
    "in any event , we believe that maximum likelihood parameters are not necessarily unbiased estimators of star formation rates and masses of high - redshift galaxies , but the broadest possible astrophysical context should be considered .",

    "<S> we find that inverted-@xmath0 models with such latter assumption give sfrs and extinctions in excellent agreement with the values derived using only the uv part of the sed , which is the one most sensitive to ongoing star formation and reddening . </S>",
    "<S> these models are also shown to accurately recover the sfrs and masses of mock galaxies at @xmath2 constructed from semi - analytic models , which we use as a further test . </S>",
    "<S> all other explored sfh templates do not fulfil these two test as well as inverted-@xmath0 models do . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , direct-@xmath0 models with unconstrained age in the fitting procedure overstimate sfrs and underestimate stellar mass , and would exacerbate an apparent mismatch between the cosmic evolution of the volume densities of sfr and stellar mass . we conclude that for high - redshift star forming galaxies an exponentially increasing sfr with a high formation redshift is preferable to other forms of the sfh so far adopted in the literature .    </S>",
