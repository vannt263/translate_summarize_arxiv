    "the nuclear matter symmetry energy is an important as well as very interesting subject in nuclear and astro - nuclear physics .",
    "as reviewed extensively in the literature @xcite , it plays a crucial role in determining many important nuclear properties , such as the neutron skin of nuclear systems , structure of nuclei near the drip line , and neutron stars masses and radii .",
    "it is especially of importance that constraints on the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) @xcite and the density ( @xmath4 ) dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath0 @xcite up to @xmath5 have been experimentally extracted from heavy - ion collisions , @xmath3 being the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "there have been a large number of theoretical derivations of @xmath0 using , for example , the brueckner hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite , dirac bhf @xcite , variational @xcite , relativistic mean field ( rmf ) @xcite and skyrme hf @xcite many - body methods .",
    "the results of these theoretical investigations have exhibited , however , large variations for @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the interactions and many - body methods used , they can give either a ` hard ' @xmath0 , in the sense that it increases monotonically with @xmath4 up to @xmath6 , or a ` soft ' one where @xmath0 arises to a maximum value at @xmath7 and then descends to zero at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it appears that the predicted behavior of @xmath0 may depend importantly on the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions and the many - body methods employed .    in the present work",
    ", we shall calculate the nuclear symmetry energy using the low - momentum interaction @xmath2 derived from realistic nn interactions @xmath9 using a renormalization group approach @xcite . to our knowledge , this renormalized interaction has not yet been applied to the study of @xmath10 .",
    "as it is well known , most realistic @xmath9 contain hard cores , or strong short - range repulsions .",
    "this feature makes these interactions not suitable for being directly used in nuclear many - body calculations ; they need to be ` tamed ' beforehand . for many years , this taming is enacted by way of the bhf theory where @xmath9 is converted into the brueckner @xmath11-matrix .",
    "a complication of the @xmath11-matrix is its energy dependence ( see e.g. @xcite ) , making it rather inconvenient for calculations . in the @xmath2 approach ,",
    "a different ` taming ' procedure is employed ; it is performed by ` integrating out ' the high - momentum components of @xmath9 beyond a decimation scale @xmath12 . in this way ,",
    "the resulting @xmath2 is energy independent .",
    "furthermore @xmath2 is nearly unique , namely the @xmath2s deduced from various realistic @xmath9 potentials ( such as @xcite ) are nearly identical to each other for decimation scale @xmath13 @xcite .    using this @xmath2 interaction",
    ", we shall first calculate the equations of state ( eos ) @xmath14 for asymmetric nuclear matter , from which @xmath0 can be obtained . here",
    "@xmath15 is the ground - state energy per nucleon and @xmath4 is the total baryon density .",
    "@xmath16 is the isospin asymmetry parameter defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote , repspectively , the neutron and proton density and @xmath20 .",
    "our eos will be calculated using a ring - diagram many - body method @xcite . as we shall discuss later",
    ", this method includes the particle - particle hole - hole ( @xmath21 ) ring diagrams to all orders . in comparison ,",
    "only the diagrams with two hole lines are included in the familiar hf , bhf and dbhf calculations . in other words , in these hf methods a closed fermi sea is employed while in the ring - diagram framework the effects from the fluctuations of the fermi sea are taken into account by including the @xmath21 ring diagrams to all orders .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath0 is related to the asymmetric nuclear matter eos by @xmath22 the contributions from terms of orders higher than @xmath23 are usually negligibly small , as illustrated by our results in section iii . with such contributions neglected",
    ", we have @xmath24 then the symmetry energy is just given by the energy difference between neutron and symmetric nuclear matter . in calculating @xmath0 , the above eos",
    "clearly play an important role . in our calculation",
    ", we shall require that the nn interaction and many - body methods employed should give satisfactory results for @xmath25 and @xmath26 of , respectively , neutron and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the use of @xmath2 alone , however , has not been able to reproduce the empirical nuclear saturation properties , the predicted saturation density and binding energy per particle being both too large compared with the empirical values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "to improve the situation , it may be necessary to include the effects from brown - rho ( br ) scaling @xcite for the in - medium mesons , or a three - nucleon force ( tnf ) @xcite .",
    "br scaling is suitable only for the low density region ; it suggests that the masses of light vector mesons in medium are reduced ` linearly ' with the density .",
    "we consider here the eos up to about @xmath6 and at such high density the linear br scaling is clearly not applicable . in the present work we shall adopt the nonlinear ericson scaling @xcite for the in - medium mesons and",
    "apply it to our @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the effects from the linear br and nonlinear ericson scalings on the nuclear eos and symmetry energy will be studied .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall briefly describe our derivation of the low - momentum interaction @xmath2 using a @xmath29-matrix equivalence approach .",
    "some details about the calculation of the eos for asymmetric nuclear matter from this interaction with the @xmath21 ring diagrams summed to all orders will also be presented .",
    "the ericson scaling is a nonlinear extension of linear br scaling .",
    "the difference between them will be addressed in this section .",
    "our results will be presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "a summary and conclsion is contained in section iv .",
    "we shall calculate @xmath0 using a low - momentum ring - diagram approach @xcite , where the @xmath21 ring diagrams are summed to all orders within a model space of decimation scale @xmath12 . in this approach",
    ", we employ the low - momentum interaction @xmath2 @xcite . briefly speaking ,",
    "this interaction is obtained by solving the following @xmath29-matrix equivalence equations : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 in the above @xmath9 represents a realistic nn interaction such as the cdbonn potential @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 denotes principal - value integration and the intermediate state momentum _",
    "q _ is integrated from 0 to @xmath34 for the whole - space @xmath29 and from 0 to @xmath12 for @xmath35 .",
    "the above @xmath2 preserves the low - energy phase shifts ( up to energy @xmath36 ) and the deuteron binding energy of @xmath9 . since @xmath2 is obtained by integrating out the high - momentum components of @xmath9 , it is a smooth ` tamed ' potential which is suitable for being used directly in many - body calculations .",
    "we use a ring - diagram method @xcite to calculate the nuclear matter eos . in this method",
    ", the ground - state energy is expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the free ( non - interacting ) eos and @xmath39 is the energy shift due to the nn interaction . in our ring - diagram approach ,",
    "@xmath39 is is given by the all - order sum of the _ pphh _ ring diagrams as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . note that we include three types of ring diagrams , the proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron ones .",
    "the proton and neutron fermi momenta are , respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . with such ring diagrams summed to all orders",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath42 where the transition amplitudes @xmath43 are obtaind from a @xmath21 rpa equation @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath44 is a strength parameter , integrated from 0 to 1 .",
    "the above ring - diagram method reduces to the usual hf method if only the first - order ring diagram is included . in this case , the above energy shift becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46=(1,0 ) if @xmath47 for proton and @xmath46=(1,0 ) if @xmath48 for neutron .",
    "it is well known that the use of the free - space @xmath9 alone is not adequate for describing nuclear properties at high densities . to satisfactorily describe such properties ,",
    "one may need to include the three - nucleon force @xcite or the in - medium modifications to the nuclear interaction . in the present work",
    ", we shall employ in our eos calculations nuclear interactions which contain the in - medium modifications suggested by the brown - rho ( br ) @xcite and ericson @xcite scalings .",
    "these scalings are based on the relation @xcite that hadron masses scale with the quark condensate @xmath49 in medium as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hadron mass in a medium of density @xmath4 , and _",
    "m _ is that in free space .",
    "the quark condenstate @xmath49 measures the chiral symmetry breaking , and its density dependence in the low - density limit is related @xcite to the free @xmath52 sigma term @xmath53 by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pion decay constant and @xmath56 @xcite . applying the above scaling to mesons in low - density nuclear medium ,",
    "one has the linear scaling @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath51 and @xmath58 are , respectively , the in - medium and free meson mass , and _",
    "c _ is a constant of value @xmath59 .",
    "the above scaling will be referred to as the linear br scaling .",
    "nucleon - nucleon interactions are mediated by meson exchanges , and clearly the in - medium modifications of meson masses can significantly alter the nn interaction . these modifications could arise from the partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite density / temperature or from traditional many - body effects .",
    "particularly important are the vector mesons , for which there is now evidence from both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite that the masses may decrease by approximately @xmath60 at normal nuclear matter density and zero temperature .",
    "( pions are not scaled because they are protected by chiral symmetry . )",
    "density - dependent nuclear interactions obtained by applying the above scaling to the light mesons ( @xmath61 , @xmath4 and @xmath62 ) which mediate the nn potential have been employed in studying the properties of nuclear matter @xcite and the @xmath63 @xmath64-decay @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the eos and @xmath10 up to densities as high as @xmath65 , and at such high densities the above linear scaling is clearly not suitable .",
    "how to scale the mesons in such high density region is still by and large uncertain .",
    "we shall adopt here the ericson scaling @xcite which is an extension of the br scaling . in this scaling , a new relation for the quark condensate @xmath49 based on chiral symmetry breaking",
    "is employed , namely @xmath66 note that this relation agrees with the linear scaling relation of eq.(8 ) for small @xmath4 .",
    "the above scaling suggests a non - linear scaling for meson mass @xmath67 with @xmath68 , and we shall refer to this scaling as the nonlinear brown - rho - ericson ( bre ) scaling . using the empirical values for ( @xmath69 ) , we have _",
    "_ d__= 0.35@xmath700.06 . in the present work",
    ", we shall employ the one - boson exchange bonna potential @xcite with its ( @xmath71 ) mesons scaled using both the linear ( eq.(9 ) ) and nonlinear ( eq.(11 ) ) scalings .",
    "this potential is chosen because it has a relatively simple structure which is convenient for scaling its meson parameters .",
    "using both the unscaled and scaled bonna potentials , we first calculate the ring - diagram eos for symmetric nuclear matter to investigate if they can give saturation properties in good agreement with the empirical values .",
    "we employ the low - momentum interactions @xmath2 from these potentials using a decimation @xmath72 , which is chosen because we are to study the eos up to high densities of @xmath6 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the eos ( labelled @xmath2 alone ) calculated with the unscaled potential saturates at @xmath73 , which is too large compared with the empirical value , and it also overbinds nuclear matter . we then repeat the calculation including the medium modifications from the br scalings . for the linear br scaling ( eq.(9 ) ) , we have used @xmath74=0.128 , @xmath75=0.113 and @xmath76=0.102 .",
    "these parameters are chosen so as to have satisfactory saturation properties , namely they give @xmath77 - 15.5 mev and @xmath78 0.17 @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "2 we also present our results obtained with the nonlinear bre scaling ( eq.(11 ) ) using parameters @xmath80=0.40 and @xmath81=0.30 .",
    "they were chosen to provide satisfactory results for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is of interest that for densities @xmath84 the eos given by the linear br and nonlinear bre scalings are practically eqivalent to each other . from eqs.(7 - 11 ) , we see that the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 obtained from the density dependence of quark condensates is @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath86 and @xmath85 parameters we have employed in the eos calculations agree well with the above theoretical values .    as also seen from fig .",
    "2 , the above equivalence begins to disappear for densities larger than @xmath3 .",
    "there the eos given by the linear scaling is much stiffer than that given by the nonlinear one ; the difference between them becomes larger and larger as density increases .",
    "in addition to the above two eos , we have also calculated an eos using the interaction given by the sum of the unscaled @xmath2 and an empiriral skyrme three - nucleon force ( tnf ) .",
    "the well - known emipirical skyrme force @xcite is of the form @xmath89 where _ v_(_i , j _ ) is a two - nucleon momentum dependent interaction , and v(i , j , k ) is a zero - range three - nucleon interaction which has played an indispensible role for nuclear saturation . for nucleons in a nuclear medium of density @xmath4 ,",
    "this three - nucleon force becomes a density - dependent two - nucleon force commonly written as @xmath90 in fig .",
    "2 the eos labelled @xmath2 with tnf is obtained using the combined interaction of @xmath2 ( unscaled ) and @xmath91 .",
    "the parameter @xmath92 is adjusted so that the resulting eos gives satisfactory saturation properties for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the eos shown has @xmath92=2000 mev-@xmath93 .",
    "it is of interest that the above three eos ( linear br and nonlinear bre , tnf ) are nearly identical for densities @xmath84 , but they deviate from each other with increasing densities . without experimental guidelines about the nuclear matter eos above @xmath3 , it would be difficult to determine which of these three eos has the correct high density behavior .",
    "fortunately , heavy - ion collision experiments conducted during the last several years have provided us with constraints of the eos at high densities .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained a constraint on the eos for symmetric nuclear matter of densities between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as shown by the red solid - line box in fig .",
    "3 . comparing our three eoss with their constraint , the linear br eos is clearly not consistent with the constraint and should be ruled out .",
    "this linear scaling is suitable for low densities , but definitely needs modification at high densities .",
    "it is primarily for this purpose that we have considered the nonlinear scaling . as displayed in fig .",
    "3 , the eos with the nonlinear bre scaling is in much better agreement with the constraint than the linear br one .",
    "it satisfies the constraint well except being slightly above the constraint at densiies near @xmath96 .",
    "it is of interest that the eos using @xmath2 with the skyrme - type tnf exhibits even better agreement with the constraint .",
    "so far we have studied the effects of the br scalings and the tnf three - nucleon force on the eos for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the neutron matter eos is also an interesting and important topic @xcite .",
    "it plays a crucial role in determining the nuclear symmetry energies as well as the properties of neutron stars .",
    "it should be of interest to study also the effects of the above br / bre scalings and the tnf force on the eos of neutron matter .",
    "using the same @xmath2 ring - diagram framework employed for symmetric nuclear matter and the same @xmath86 , @xmath85 and @xmath92 parameters , we have caculated the neutron matter eos up to 4.5@xmath3 .",
    "our calculated neutron - matter eos are displayed in fig .",
    "4 . danielewicz _",
    "@xcite have given two different constraints for the neutron matter eos : a stiff one ( upper black solid - line box ) and a soft one ( lower red solid - line box ) which are both displayed in fig .",
    "as we can see , the linear br eos is again producing too much pressure .",
    "the nonlinear bre eos agrees well with the stiff constraint ( upper box ) while the tnf eos is fully within the soft constraint box .",
    "to further test these two eos ( nonlinear bre and tnf ) , it would be very helpful to have narrower experimental constraints on the neutron matter eos .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath10 is a topic of much current interest , and extensive studies have been carried out to extract its density dependence from heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite .",

    "our results with the tnf force are below the empirical ones of both @xcite and @xcite , giving a softer density dependence than both .",
    "it may be noticed that for densities ( @xmath105 ) , the calculated and empirical results are all in good agreement with each other .",

    "the effective nn interactions in medium are different from those in free space , and when using them in nuclear many - body problems it may be necessary to include the renormalization effects due to the presence of other nucleons .",
    "we have considered several methods to incorporate such medium corrections .",
    "although the nuclear matter saturation properties can satisfactorily be reproduced by including the medium corrections from the well - known linear brown - rho scaling for the in - medium mesons , this scaling produces an eos which is too stiff compared with the danielewicz constraints .",
    "we have found that the eos obtained with the nonlinear brown - rho - ericson scaling are in good agreement with the danielewicz constraints .",

    "<S> we have calculated the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath0 up to densities of @xmath1 with the effects from the brown - rho ( br ) and ericson scalings for the in - medium mesons included . using the @xmath2 low - momentum interaction with and without such scalings , the equations of state ( eos ) of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter have been calculated using a ring - diagarm formalism where the particle - particle - hole - hole ring diagrams are included to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> the eos for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter obtained with linear br scaling are both overly stiff compared with the empirical constraints of danielewicz _ et al . </S>",
