    "classical cepheids play a fundamental role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale thanks to their characteristic period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations . in particular , the application of a large magellanic cloud ( lmc)-based pl relation to external galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has led to the calibration of secondary distance indicators and in turn to an estimate of the hubble constant ( h@xmath2 ; see , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the lmc distance has traditionally played a crucial role in the extragalactic distance determination , with values lower than 18.50 mag implying the so called `` short distance scale '' and values larger than 18.50 mag suggesting a `` long distance scale '' .",
    "one of the most important issues to be considered when dealing with the cepheid pl relation is its dependence on the metallicity .",
    "the universality of the pl relation , and the possibility that its slope and/or zero - point might depend on the chemical composition , have been actively debated for two decades , on both observational and theoretical grounds , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "no general consensus has been reached so far .",
    "empirical calibrations of the lmc pl and plc relations are generally based on field cepheids , implying the presence of uncertainties due to the range in distance ( depth effects * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) and extinction ( differential reddening , see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , any theoretical scenario for pulsation models aimed at providing robust support to empirical calibrations needs to be tested against observational constraints based on statistically significant samples of cepheids with accurate light curves .",
    "the populous blue lmc cluster ngc1866 is already known to host an exceptionally rich sample of more then 20 cepheids @xcite .",
    "one of these was identified by @xcite in a preliminary analysis of the proprietary _ bvi _ vlt data .",
    "it is unquestionable that such a unique sample of cepheids ",
    "likely all members of the cluster and at the same distance , chemical composition and age  would constitute a milestone in our understanding of the cepheid pulsational scenario .",
    "indeed , it offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate both empirical and theoretical estimates of the luminosity and color of the pulsating structures and their relation with the observed periods . for this reason ,",
    "many authors have studied the ngc1866 cepheids @xcite in both the optical and near infrared bands , and have tested different methods to calibrate the pl relations in different filters . in @xcite",
    "we already discussed the sample of the 23 known cepheids in ngc1866 , concluding that unfortunately only 4 to 6 cepheids had light curves accurate enough to allow a meaningful determination of their luminosities and colors . on the basis of such a tantalizing situation , we took advantage of assigned observing time at the eso very large telescope to perform an accurate photometric investigation of the cluster field , with the aim of securing suitable data constraining the light curves of all the member cepheids .",
    "moreover , to get accurate information about radial velocities and chemical abundances of the stars in ngc1866 , we have performed flames@vlt spectroscopic observations for 30 stars ( 19 belonging to the cluster and 11 to the lmc field ) , including 3 cepheids @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that , as far as the chemical composition is concerned , the cluster stars are reasonably homogeneous .",
    "indeed , they appear to share the same abundances within the uncertainties , and this property is independent of the evolutionary status .",
    "the average iron abundance is @xmath3=-0.43 \\pm 0.01 $ ] dex , with a dispersion @xmath4 dex . for the three spectroscopically investigated cepheids @xcite , adopting the same procedure used in @xcite , found values fully consistent with the average iron content .",
    "moreover , @xcite applied the cors baade - wesselink method @xcite to a sample of 11 cepheids , using radial velocities obtained both from our flames investigation and from literature data ( see references therein ) , and light curves based on a part of the _ ubvi _ data used in this paper complemented with _ k _ data by @xcite . in this way",
    ", they obtained a direct estimate of the distance modulus of ngc1866 , @xmath5 mag ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    in this paper , we analyze the properties of ngc1866 cepheids , relying on an extensive multifilter dataset not only to derive information about the distance , but also to test pulsational and evolutionary theoretical models .",

    "for the interpretation of the observed properties of the variable stars in ngc1866 , we adopt the theoretical pulsation scenario developed by our team ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and based on nonlinear convective pulsation models for different assumptions on the metallicity . for each assumed fixed chemical composition , a wide range of model masses is explored and the luminosities are selected according to evolutionary predictions for the mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation of central helium - burning intermediate - mass stars . in the `` canonical '' scenario both mass loss and convective overshooting are neglected , whereas in the `` noncanonical '' assumption an overluminosity of 0.25 dex at fixed mass is expected as a result of mild core overshooting and/or moderate mass loss ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "according to this theoretical scenario the effect of variations in both the metallicity and the helium content on the predicted coefficients of the pl and plc relations is not negligible @xcite . on the other hand",

    "in particular the wpl relation was also derived with an explicit dependence on both the metallicity and the excess luminosity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the canonical luminosity level .",
    "this allows us to check the theoretical models both for canonical ( @xmath62 ) and noncanonical ( @xmath63 dex ) assumptions ( see table 3 in * ? ? ?",

    "the estimate for the lmc agrees quite well with the aforementioned value @xmath78 mag .",
