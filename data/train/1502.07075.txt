    "the primary characteristics of globular proteins are their native structures and sequences of amino acids .",
    "an evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor may lead diverse sequences to fold to nearly the same native structure .",
    "one particularly interesting example is citrate synthase ( cs ) , an enzyme that is found in most living organisms , from bacteria to man @xcite .",
    "it acts as a part of the krebs cycle that generates atp @xcite .",
    "the native structure of cs from a bacteria living in hot hydrothermal vents is superimposable with that of cs from a bacteria living under the conditions of extreme cold @xcite and yet properties of these proteins , such as the thermodynamic stability , are distinct so that the enzymatic action ",
    "conversion of acetyl - coa and oxaloacetate into coa and citrate @xcite  is executed properly .    in this paper , we investigate to what extent structure - based coarse - grained models , or rather their one specific implementation , can capture physical differences between proteins which belong to the same fold .",
    "we study four cs proteins and demonstrate that their properties are indeed distinct in the model due to the existence of slight differences in the native structures . in particular , the model thermophilic proteins are found to have stronger thermodynamic stability than those which are cryophilic ( an equivalent term is : psychrophilic ) .",
    "however , we also find that the root - mean - square single - site fluctuations are alike within the very region of the active site of the thermophilic and cryophilic forms , even though they are distinct in other parts of the proteins .",
    "the structure - based dynamical models follow from go s idea @xcite that kinetic and thermodynamic properties of proteins should depend primarily on the geometry of the native structure and less so directly on the specificity of the sequence .",
    "there are many variants of such models ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "they are not equivalent , but their predictions are expected to be most accurate in a vicinity of the native state  a situation encountered , for instance , during stretching manipulations @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that protein folding processes may be proceeding as in the go - like models due to minimization of hindrances to folding @xcite .",
    "large - scale conformational changes in proteins can be explored by multi - state go - type models @xcite and mixed elastic network models @xcite .",
    "in contrast , standard elastic network models , which are less demanding computationally than molecular dynamics simulations , are known to capture local fluctuations about the native state @xcite . here ,",
    "we employ a standard go - type model to examine thermal stability , local flexibility , collective motions and unfolding kinetics of cs enzymes functioning in organisms that live in very different environmental conditions .    the adaptations of life to different environmental conditions",
    "can be observed at various levels of organization , including the molecular level .",
    "the composition and structure of proteins from organisms living under extreme conditions @xcite are known to correlate with the character of the environment .",
    "for instance , thermophilic organisms , i.e. those thriving between 45@xmath0  c and 120@xmath0  c , tend to contain proteins with smaller cavities , bigger number of ionic bonds , increased polarity of exposed surfaces , an increased content of charged residues and tryptophan , and a smaller content of phenylalanine , methionine and asparagine compared to proteins in mesophilic organisms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "cryophilic organisms , i.e. those which grow and reproduce between about -20@xmath0  c to + 10@xmath0  c , tend to contain proteins with larger catalytic cavities , reduced content of proline and arginine ( to make the backbone more flexible ) , increased content of clusters of glycines , less hydrophobic cores ( to make the protein less compact ) , a higher proportion of non - polar groups on the surface , and an increased content of negative charges on the surface ( to facilitate interactions with the solvent ) @xcite .",
    "structure - based models can not explicitly take all of these many detailed chemical features into account , but these features lead to a particular structure of the native conformation .",
    "therefore , such models can tell the thermophilic and cryophilic proteins apart even if they belong to the same fold .",
    "we shall inquire here  to what extent .",
    "these models also identify properties that are similar .",
    "we illustrate these aspects here by considering cs .",
    "cs is an @xmath1-protein homodimer .",
    "[ fig:0 ] shows an example of the native conformation ",
    "it is for cs from _ pyrococcus furiosus _ with the protein data bank ( pdb ) code 1aj8 and atomic coordinates resolved for 741 amino acids @xcite .",
    "it is formed of two identical subunits , each with its own active site .",
    "each of the subunits comprises two domains  a small domain , which comprises five @xmath1-helices , and and a large domain which contains 13 @xmath1-helices .",
    "in other species , the number of the helices in the large domain varies between 11 and 15 .",
    "the substrate binding site is located in a cleft between the two domains .",
    "two kinds of conformations of cs have been identified : one is termed open and the other closed. cs is in the open conformation when the active site is not occupied and is thus free to bind substrate molecules for the enzyme catalysis .",
    "when the substrate binds , the small domain undergoes a rotation , sealing the substrate binding site and forming the closed conformation .",
    "a number of crystal structures of cs from different organisms are available in the pdb .",
    "the five structures we have considered in our study are summarized in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "it would be ideal to also consider an open form of cs form a cryophilic organism , but they do not seem to be available in the pdb .",
    ".[table:1 ] structures of cs from different organisms used in this study .",
    "structures of the closed conformation contain the reaction products ( coa and citrate ) .",
    "the products are absent in the open conformation structures . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting to ask whether the stability temperature is correlated with the average contact order @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the number of residues in an amino acid chain , where @xmath4 is the total number of the native contacts , and @xmath5 is the sequence separation between residues @xmath6 and @xmath7 that form a native contact .",
    "note that the contact order is uniquely defined only for single amino acid chains ( monomers ) .",
    "the values of the average contact order as calculated from the contact maps of the five cs forms are given in the last column of table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "interestingly , we find no correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . a similar conclusion has been reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to validate our simulations , we compare experimental and simulational temperature factors of the different css , see fig .",

    "the simulations have been done at @xmath10 which is close to @xmath9 .",
    "although the temperature factors in a crystal may in general differ from those in a solution , this approach has been widely used to parametrize elastic network models @xcite .",
    "we obtain very good agreement for the 2ibp and 1a59 structures , see panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for 1aj8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) , the simulation pattern closely resembles the distribution of the crystallographic @xmath11 factors but its magnitude is too small .",
    "however , simulations at @xmath12 fit the experiment much better , see the blue line in fig  [ fig:3](c ) .",
    "we do not compare results for 1cts because the resolution of the mesophilic cs structure in the open conformation ( 1cts ) is only 2.7   .",
    "the resolution for the structures of 2ibp , 1a59 , and 1aj8 is much better and is equal to 1.6   , 2.1   , and 1.9   respectively .",
    "we note that the average crystallographic @xmath11 factor , @xmath13 , is @xmath14  @xmath15 for the thermophilic cs in the closed conformation ( 1aj8 ) , and @xmath16  @xmath15 for the cryophilic cs in the closed conformation ( 1a59 ) .",
    "importantly , in both cases the protein crystals have been reported to be obtained at the room temperature .",
    "the experimental data would thus imply that the thermophilic cs is , on average , more flexible than its cryophilic homologue at the same temperature .",
    "one would certainly expect the opposite relation .",
    "this inconsistency might be a reason for the quantitative disagreement between simulations and experiment in the case of 1aj8 , see fig .",

    "the residues that have the largest @xmath11 factors are localized in the small domain ( the region highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , primarily in the segments that bind the coa molecule .",
    "in contrast , the residues that bind citrate ( indicated by the vertical lines in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) have relatively small temperature factors .",
    "when one compares the @xmath11 factors of the thermophilic and cryophilic proteins in the closed conformation , see panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , then they are seen to map out very similar looking patterns no matter whether one uses the experimental results at the room temperature ( red solid lines in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) or the simulational results at @xmath17 ( black dashed lines in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath18 or @xmath19 are calculated at a higher @xmath20 for the thermophilic form and at a lower @xmath20 for the cryophilic form then the match in the patterns is better quantitatively .",
    "[ fig:3](d ) compares @xmath18 for 1aj8 and 1a59 at their respective stability temperatures .",

    "[ fig:3 ] the citrate binding residues are labeled with vertical lines .",

    "[ fig:4 ] shows the rmsfs of these seven amino acid residues as a function of @xmath20 . in the closed conformation ,",

    "the active site in the thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes fluctuate in a similar manner but quite differently than in the closed conformation , see panels a and b in fig  [ fig:4 ] . here , the residues that fluctuate the most are his@xmath22 and asp@xmath23 , which are involved in the reaction of citrate formation .",
    "the residues that exhibit smallest fluctuations are arg@xmath21 and his@xmath23 .",

    "this result seems consistent with the division of functions between residues in the active site : some amino acids are tailored to binding the substrate , whereas others participate in the catalytic process .      in order to identify collective motions of the active site residues , we compute the equal - time correlation coefficients @xmath29 as defined in eq .",

    "the positive correlations with @xmath31 are labeled with red circles and indicate that the pairs of residues often move together in the same direction .",
    "the negative correlations are depicted as blue squares and indicate that the pairs have a tendency to move simultaneously in opposite directions .",

    "the three residues in the small domain exhibit motions that are anti - correlated with the motions of his@xmath26 and arg@xmath24 , which are placed in the large domain .",
    "therefore , the collective motions of the active site in the open conformation seem to be due to the displacements of the small domain relative to the large domain .    to further quantify this observation we compute the variations of the inter - residue distances , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average distance between residues @xmath6 and @xmath7 forming the active site .",

    "[ fig:5 ] illustrate the distance variations in the open conformation of the thermophilic ( left panel ) and mesophilic ( right panel ) enzymes .",
    "the smallest distance variations ( red circles ) are observed for the residue pairs that exhibit correlated motions with @xmath31 .",
    "the largest distance variations ( blue squares ) are observed almost exclusively for the residue pairs that exhibit negative spatial correlations and , thus , have the propensity to move in opposite directions .",
    "importantly , these results show that the motions of largest amplitudes occur primarily between the residues located in different domains , and the small - amplitude motions are mainly between the residues residing in the same domains .    in the open conformation of the thermophilic cs",
    ", we can distinguish three groups of spatially - correlated residues : the first group comprises the three residues in the small domain , arg@xmath25 , his@xmath24 and asp@xmath25 ; the second group consists of his@xmath25 and arg@xmath26 ; and the third group is his@xmath26 and arg@xmath24 . within each of the groups ,",

    "for example , his@xmath25 and arg@xmath26 often move together in the same direction ( @xmath36 ) but almost independently from other residues of the active site .",
    "interestingly , all the residues in the first group are spatially anti - correlated with the residues in the third group",

    ", we observe only positive correlations , @xmath38 , and rather small inter - residue distance variations , @xmath39   , see fig .",
    "s1 in supplementary material @xcite . here , due to the presence of the citrate and coa molecules ,",
    "the small domain is tightly bound to the large domain , and the active site residues have no freedom to perform any large - amplitude motions .",
    "therefore , the residues in the small domain are positively correlated with those in the large domain .",
    "interestingly , the active sites in the thermophilic and cryophilic cs exhibit the same pattern of correlations , see the top panels in fig .  s1 .",
    "another way to assess thermal stability of proteins is to simulate their unfolding at elevated temperatures as analyzed theoretically in ref .",
    "the unfolding simulations start at the native state and finish when all nonlocal contacts get broken , which defines the unfolding time @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite , @xmath43 has been taken to be 4 to eliminate the local contacts in @xmath1-helices , but this choice is too demanding computationally in the current context .",
    "we performed unfolding simulations at high temperatures only for the cs dimers in the open conformation because dissociation of the citrate and coa molecules from cs occurs much faster than protein unfolding or dimer dissociation ( kinetic constants for the successive steps of the cs reaction at physiological conditions are detailed , for example , in ref .",

    "the histograms of @xmath40 for the thermophilic ( 2ibp ) and mesophilic ( 1cts ) cs in the open conformation are shown in the left - hand - side panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "these histograms demonstrate that the thermophilic cs unfolds slower at @xmath48 than the mesophilic cs at @xmath49 , which means that the thermophilic enzyme is more resistant to thermal denaturation .",
    "also , the histograms seem to display multi - peak profiles , which suggests that there might be more than one characteristic time scale governing the thermal unfolding of the cs dimers . to further characterize the unfolding kinetics , it is instructive to calculate the fraction of the number of trajectories , @xmath50 , in which the unfolding event has not occurred within time @xmath51 from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the fraction @xmath50 provides an estimate for the probability of not unfolding cs within time @xmath51 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "s2 @xcite , there is an initial lag phase in which @xmath52 .",
    "the lag phase is followed by a fast decrease of @xmath50 .",
    "interestinlgy , we find that the decay of @xmath53 with @xmath51 is not exponential .    the right - hand - side panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the average unfolding time , @xmath54 , as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the average is taken over 200 trajectories .",
    "the error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean . at any specified temperature ,",
    "the thermophilic cs ( 2ibp ) exhibits significantly larger unfolding time than the mesophilic cs ( 1cts ) .",
    "this result shows that the thermophilic enzyme is thermally more stable than its mesophilic homologue .",
    "based on the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath20 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , the difference in stability temperatures is of the order @xmath55 , which corresponds to about 80@xmath0  c.    we use an analogous method to quantify thermal dissociation of cs dimers .",
    "the dynamics of the system is exactly the same as in the unfolding simulations but only the contacts between the monomers are monitored .",
    "the simulations start at the native state and finish when all contacts between the monomers get broken , which defines the unbinding time @xmath56 . in the range of temperatures studied , @xmath57 in all the trajectories .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] show histograms of the unbinding time for the thermophilic ( 2ibp ) and mesophilic ( 1cts ) cs in the open conformation at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these data show that the thermophilic dimer is more resistant to thermal dissociation . to characterize the dissociation kinetics , we compute the fraction of the number of trajectories , @xmath60 , in which the unbinding event has not occurred within time @xmath51 .",
    "s2 @xcite shows @xmath60 for 2ibp and 1cts at different temperatures . we note that the decay of @xmath61 with @xmath51 is not exponential .",

    "[ fig:8 ] shows the average unbinding time , @xmath62 , as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the average is taken over 200 trajectories , and the error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean . at any given temperature ,",
    "@xmath62 of the thermophilic cs dimer ( 2ibp ) is significantly larger than that of the mesophilic enzyme ( 1cts ) .",
    "interestingly , the two plots of @xmath62 versus @xmath20 overlap if the temperature is shifted by about @xmath63 .",
    "this temperature shift corresponds roughly to 60@xmath0  c , which is consistent with the difference in the optimal growth temperatures , see table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we performed langevin dynamics simulations of cs dimers from thermophilic , mesophilic and cryophilic organisms using a coarse - grained structure - based model that does not differentiate between the ionic , hydrophobic or van der waals interactions .",
    "in fact , the interactions between different amino acid residues are described in this model by the same potential energy function .",
    "although this model might seem oversimplified , it correctly predicts that the thermophilic cs is thermally more stable than the mesophilic and cryophilic ones .",
    "it also yields root - mean - square fluctuates of single amino acid residues that are fully consistent with crystallographic temperature factors .",
    "therefore , the precise location of the amino acid contacts appears to be a key element in explaining thermodynamic properties and local flexibility of enzymes .",
    "the difference of the thermodynamical stability temperatures , @xmath64 , can be obtained from the native state probabilities ( see section [ sec:3.1 ] ) . for the cs dimers from thermophilic and cryophilic organisms in the closed conformation we obtain @xmath65  c ; for the thermophilic and mesophilic cs dimers in the open conformation we get @xmath66  c. these values are smaller than expected .",
    "the expected difference in melting temperatures between the mesophilic and thermophilic cs dimers is about @xmath67  c as reported in a recent study  @xcite .",
    "the likely reason for the fact that our model underestimates the transition temperature differences is that it lacks some relevant sequence effects . as discussed in section  [ section : methods ] , the atomic structures of the cs proteins are used in the go - type model only to construct the contact maps whereas the chemical composition of the proteins is not directly included in the energy function of the model as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the temperature of optimal folding , @xmath9 , is one measure of the thermodynamic stability of proteins .",
    "another measure is provided by the kinetics of thermal unfolding ( see section [ sec:3.5 ] ) .",
    "these two measures are quite different as they refer to equilibrium properties near the native state and dynamic properties away from the native state , respectively .",
    "one measures the frequency of the situations in which all contacts are present simultaneously , and the other focuses on rupture events up to a given sequential length .",
    "the stability temperature difference obtained from the thermal unfolding of cs dimers from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms ( see fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) is of the order of 80@xmath0  c. we note that this value can be affected by the partition of the native contacts into local and nonlocal ( we used the sequential distance cut - off @xmath42 in our analysis ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the stability temperature difference obtained from the thermal dissociation of cs dimers from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms is about 60@xmath0  c ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "we note that this value is unaffected by the choice of the sequential distance cut - off , @xmath43 , as we take into account all inter - monomer contacts in the analysis of the simulation data .",
    "interestingly , this temperature difference , 60@xmath0  c , is consistent with the difference in the optimal growth temperatures as given in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we analyzed thermal fluctuates and collective motions of the active site in cs enzymes from different organisms , both in the open and closed conformations .",
    "we find that the three residues that are directly involved in the chemical reaction of citrate formation exhibit rather small fluctuations in the closed conformation . in the open conformation ,",
    "however , the thermal fluctuations of these three residues are significantly enhanced .",
    "we also find that the collective motions of the active site in the open conformation are mainly due to the movements of the small domain relative to the large domain . in the open conformation , due to the presence of the citrate and coa molecules ,",
    "the small domain is tightly bound to the large domain , and the active site residues have no freedom to perform any large - amplitude collective motions .",

    "<S> the pattern of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is different than in the open conformation , including within the active site . </S>",
    "<S> the modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids forming the active site are very different in the open and closed conformations . taken together , our results show that the precise location of amino acid contacts in the native structure appears to be a critical element in explaining the similarities and differences in the thermodynamic properties , local flexibility and collective motions of the different forms of the enzyme . </S>"
