    "+       the supernova remnant ( snr ) g344.70.1 was discovered in radio observations ( caswell et al .  1975 ) and exhibits largely asymmetric structure with a diameter of @xmath0@xmath1 and a bright western part ( dubner et al .  1993 ; whiteoak & green 1996 ) . in x - rays ,",
    "the snr was first identified by the _",
    "asca _ galactic plane survey ( sugizaki et al .",
    "@xcite found that the _ asca _ spectrum can be reproduced by an optically - thin thermal plasma with an electron temperature of @xmath01  kev .",
    "owing to the limited photon statistics , however , they could not determine whether the plasma had achieved collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) or was still in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) .",
    "another interesting result from _ asca _ was the possible detection of fe - k@xmath2 emission with an energy of 6.4 ( @xmath3 0.2 )  kev .",
    "its origin was suggested to be either fluorescence from cold dense clouds or low - ionized plasma , but was not definitively determined .",
    "the x - ray morphology of the snr was examined in detail during _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the emission correlates relatively well with the radio structure @xcite , but the x - ray peak is located more interior with respect to that in the radio @xcite . it was argued that the irregular morphology of this snr may be due to expansion through a dense interstellar medium ( ism ) with a density gradient toward the western part .",
    "@xcite suggested that this dense environment interacting with the snr s shock is a plausible counterpart of the unidentified tev @xmath4-ray source hess j1702420 ( aharonian et al .",
    "notably , @xcite discovered a point - like source , cxou j170357.8414302 , at the geometrical center of the snr with no significant extended emission to indicate a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the source was , therefore , suggested to be a possible candidate for a compact central object ( cco ) physically associated with the snr .",
    "however , the absorption column of the point source was found to be significantly smaller than that of the snr , implying that the source is a foreground object .",
    "in fact , the infrared / optical object coinciding with cxou j170357.8414302 exhibits typical characteristics of an early - k star @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of g344.70.1 is currently not well identified , but most of the previous works are supportive of a core - collapse ( cc ) origin , based mainly on its associations with a nearby molecular cloud or a wind - blown bubble ( combi et al .  2010 ; giacani et al .",
    "in fact , infrared emission from shocked molecular gas has been observed in this snr , which is more common in cc snrs than in type  ia remnants ( reach et al .",
    "2006 ; andersen et al .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been argued that its highly asymmetric x - ray morphology is somewhat similar to other cc snrs @xcite . in these studies , however , the abundances of heavy elements could not be measured accurately , and the detection of the fe k - shell emission was not clear or only marginal . since production of fe ( @xmath5ni , before nuclear decay ) is significantly different between cc and type  ia supernovae ( sne ) ( e.g. , iwamoto et al .  1999 ) , clear detection and diagnostics of the fe emission as well as accurate measurements of the elemental abundances could help resolve the nature of its progenitor and environment .    in this paper , we present the results of the _ suzaku _ observation of g344.70.1 , utilizing its high spectral sensitivity especially in the fe k - shell x - ray ( 67  kev ) band .",
    "the errors quoted in the text and tables are at the 90% confidence level , and the error bars given in the spectra are for 1@xmath6 confidence , unless otherwise stated .",
    "g344.70.1 was observed by _ suzaku _ on 2007 february 21 , using x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xiss ) .",
    "each xis consists of three active x - ray sensors .",
    "two of them are installed with front - illuminated ( fi ) sensors , while the other is installed with a back - illuminated ( bi ) sensor .",
    "we used the standard tools of ` headas ` version 6.11 for the data reduction .",
    "the archival data were reprocessed with the calibration database released on 2011 august 11 and reduced in accordance with the recommended screening criteria.@xmath7 the total effective exposure time after the screening was about 44  ks . only grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 events were used in the following analysis .      in figure",

    "2008 ) .    to compare the surface brightness distribution among the different energy bands , intensity contours for the si - k emission are superimposed on the images in figure  [ fig : image](c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) .",
    "the spatial profiles of the s - k and hard continuum emission are highly correlated with the si - k image , whereas the peak of the fe - k emission is slightly shifted toward the south .",
    "an equivalent - width ( ew ) map for the fe - k line is shown in figure  [ fig : image](f ) , where the continuum level was estimated by scaling the hard image with a bremsstrahlung model fitting for the 4.26.0  kev spectrum .",
    "the fe - k ew is enhanced at the southeastern part of the remnant , and not spatially correlated with the si - k emission .",
    "we extracted the xis spectra of the entire snr from a circular region with a radius of 3.@xmath162 ( shown in figure  [ fig : image](b ) ) , but the central point source was excluded .",
    "the two fi spectra were summed up to improve the photon statistics , since their characteristics are almost identical .",
    "the background data were taken from an annulus surrounding the snr with inner and outer radii of 5.@xmath160 and 7.@xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the resultant spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : full](a ) .",
    "we see the fe - k@xmath2 line detected with good statistics . using xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) , we first fitted the spectra with an absorbed nei plasma model , wabs @xmath17 vnei ( k.  borkowski ) .",
    "the free parameters were the absorption column density ( @xmath18 ) , electron temperature ( @xmath19 ) , ionization timescale ( @xmath20 ) , volume emission measure ( vem ) , and elemental abundances of mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe relative to the solar values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the photo - electric absorption cross sections were taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "the gain calibration of the xis is known to be problematic around the energy of the neutral si k - edge ( e.g. , yamaguchi et al .",
    "therefore , we ignore the energy range of 1.751.90  kev in the bi spectrum , similar to yamaguchi et al .",
    "in addition , a significant inconsistency between the fi and bi data was found below 1  kev . although we also attempted to use background data from a blank sky region and pure non x - ray background data , instead of the data taken from the outer annulus region , the inconsistency remained in all cases .",
    "we conclude that the problem is not caused by the background subtraction but is due to issues related to the source spectra .",
    "one of the possible origins is an incomplete calibration of the thickness of contamination material accumulated on the optical blocking filters of the xis ( koyama et al .",
    "although this is not definitive , we excluded the data below 1.0  kev from the following analysis .    , cr - k@xmath2 , and mn - k@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that the energies below 1.0  kev are ignored from the spectral fitting .",
    "[ fig : full ] ]    the model described above gave a good fit to the emission lines at energies below 4  kev and the overall continuum spectrum , but failed to reproduce the fe - k@xmath2 line profile ; the peak energy was lower in the data than in the model .",
    "although we temporarily used a plane - parallel shock model ( vpshock ; borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) instead of the simple vnei model , no significant improvement was achieved .",
    "this implies that the residual fe - k@xmath2 emission arises from either another plasma component with a lower ionization timescale or fluorescence of neutral matter . to reveal its nature",
    ", we examined the fe - k@xmath2 line parameters with an additional gaussian model .",
    "hereafter , the fe abundance in the vnei component was fixed to unity , as for the other fixed parameters ( c , n , o , and ne ) . the center energy and ew of the additional fe - k@xmath2 component",
    "were obtained to be 6.44 ( @xmath21 )  kev and 3.7 ( @xmath22 )  kev , respectively .",
    "since the former value is significantly different from the energy of k@xmath2 emission from neutral fe ( 6.40  kev ) , we can safely reject the fluorescence scenario .",
    "furthermore , the ew corresponds to an fe abundance higher than 10  solar for any electron temperature , implying that the predominant origin of the emission is likely to be the ejecta rather than the ism .",
    "interestingly , the measured fe - k@xmath2 centroid is fully consistent with that observed in tycho s snr ( tamagawa et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggesting a similar ionization state of fe in both snrs .",
    "tamagawa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also reported the detection of the fe - k@xmath23 line in the _ suzaku _ spectrum of tycho s snr , with k@xmath23/k@xmath2 intensity ratio of @xmath00.05 .",
    "we followed this result to add another gaussian at 7.11  kev by assuming the same intensity ratio .",
    "the best fit thereby obtained had @xmath19 = 1.0  kev and @xmath24/dof  = 410/309 . the residual with this model",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : full](b ) .    although the fit is now almost acceptable , a prominent line - like residual is still observed at @xmath01.6  kev ( in both the fi and bi spectra ) .",
    "we tried two - component vnei models , but this residual did not disappear even with independent free parameters including abundances between the components .",
    "given that the vnei component already takes into account the k@xmath23 emission of mg xi ( 1.58  kev ) , the most likely origin of this feature is al xii k@xmath2 blend ( e.g. , 1.60  kev for the resonance line ) that is not included in the vnei code in xspec . introducing a gaussian to account for this emission",
    ", we achieved a significant reduction in the @xmath24/dof  value ( from 410/309 to 354/306 ) .",
    "in addition , we still see small residuals at @xmath05.5  kev and @xmath06.1  kev ( indicated by black arrows in figure  [ fig : full](b ) ) , possibly due to cr- and mn - k@xmath2 emissions , respectively . adding a gaussian for the former resulted the reduction in @xmath24 of 15 , while that for the latter resulted the additional reduction of 9 . the best - fit parameters and residuals from the model obtained after adding these emission features are given in the  model  ax \" column in table  [ tab : best ] and figure  [ fig : full](c ) , respectively .    llcccc component & parameter & model  ax & model  bx & model  as & model  bs + absorption@xmath25 & @xmath18(@xmath26 @xmath27 ) & 4.7@xmath28 & 5.1@xmath29 & 4.6@xmath30 & 4.6@xmath31 + nei plasma@xmath32 & @xmath19 ( kev ) & 0.98@xmath33 & 0.92@xmath34 & 1.01@xmath34 & 0.96@xmath35 +   & mg ( solar ) & 0.52@xmath36 & 0.87@xmath37 & 0.66@xmath36 & 0.60@xmath38 +   & al ( solar ) &  &  & 1.9@xmath39 & 1.6@xmath40 +   & si ( solar ) & 1.1@xmath30 & 1.3@xmath28 & 1.3@xmath30 & 1.1@xmath30 +   & s ( solar ) & 1.9@xmath30 & 2.0@xmath30 & 2.2@xmath30 & 2.0@xmath30 +   & ar ( solar ) & 2.0@xmath28 & 2.1@xmath28 & 2.3@xmath28 & 2.2@xmath28 +   & ca ( solar ) & 2.2@xmath28 & 2.2@xmath29 & 2.8@xmath40 & 2.7@xmath40 +   & @xmath20 ( @xmath41 @xmath42 s ) & 1.7@xmath28 & 2.2@xmath43 & 1.2@xmath28 & 1.3@xmath28 +   & vem ( @xmath44 @xmath45)@xmath46 & 7.0@xmath47 & 8.0@xmath48 & 6.1@xmath49 & 7.2@xmath50 + fe ejecta & @xmath51 ( ev ) & 6447@xmath52 &  & 6455@xmath53 &  +   & @xmath19 ( kev ) &  & 3.6@xmath54 &  & 2.8@xmath55 +   & @xmath20 ( @xmath56 @xmath42 s ) &  & 9.3@xmath57 &  & 7.2@xmath58 +   & @xmath6 ( ev ) & 78@xmath59 & 67@xmath60 & 85@xmath61 & 75@xmath62 +   & normalization@xmath63 & 2.8@xmath29 & 1.4@xmath64 & 3.0@xmath29 & 2.2@xmath65 + al - k@xmath2 & @xmath51 ( ev ) & 1585@xmath66 & 1585@xmath67 &  &  +   & @xmath6 ( ev ) & 8@xmath68 & 12@xmath69 &  &  +   & flux ( @xmath70 ph @xmath27 s@xmath71 ) & 3.7@xmath72 & 5.6@xmath73 &  &  + cr - k@xmath2@xmath74 & @xmath51 ( ev ) & 5526@xmath75 & 5524@xmath76 & 5530@xmath77 & 5527@xmath78 +   & flux ( @xmath79 ph @xmath27 s@xmath71 ) & 3.6@xmath80 & 3.4@xmath81 & 3.6@xmath82 & 3.3@xmath81 + mn - k@xmath2@xmath74 & @xmath51 ( ev ) & 6085@xmath83 & 6106@xmath84 & 6076@xmath85 & 6088@xmath86 +   & flux ( @xmath79 ph @xmath27 s@xmath71 ) & 2.4@xmath87 & 2.4@xmath88 & 2.3@xmath89 & 2.2@xmath90 + & 330/302 & 319/301 & 370/304 & 362/303 +    as a final step , we replaced the 6.44-kev gaussian ( fe - k@xmath2 ) with a vnei model which consists purely of fe ions and electrons , because the fe - rich ejecta may contribute to the l - shell emission as well .",
    "we found that the fe - k@xmath2 line is broadened to a width greater than that expected for a single vnei or vpshock model , and thus introduced a gsmooth model to convolve the second vnei ( fe ejecta ) component with a gaussian with a finite width .",
    "in addition , since the vnei model does not include the fe - k@xmath23 line data , we left the 7.11-kev gaussian by fixing its flux to the best - fit value from model  ax .",
    "the resultant spectral model is shown in figure  [ fig : full2 ] , and the best - fit parameters are given in the  model  bx \" column in table  [ tab : best ] .",
    "all the values are consistent with those in model  ax within the statistical errors .",
    "this implies that neither uncertainty in fe l - shell emissivity nor an electron temperature of the fe - ejecta component crucially affects the abundance measurement .    , but a pure fe plasma model is used instead of the fe - k@xmath2 gaussian .",
    "the model components with solid lines and residuals are for model  bx .",
    "the blue dotted line indicates the contribution of the fe ejecta component in the best fit of model  bs . the fe l - shell flux is weaker than that in model  bx .",
    "[ fig : full2 ] ]    we further analyzed the spectrum with the same procedure but using the spex software package ( kaastra et al .",
    "1996 ) , so as to estimate the systematic uncertainties in the results as carefully as possible .",
    "since the nei model in spex includes the al k - shell emission , the gaussian at 1.6  kev was removed .",
    "the results are given in the columns of  model  as \" and  model  bs \" in table  [ tab : best ] .",
    "again , no significant variation is found among the results with different models or atomic codes .",
    "the contribution of the fe ejecta component in model  bs is shown as a blue dotted line in figure  [ fig : full2 ] .",
    "we found that the emissivity ratio of the fe l - shell to k - shell emissions is generally given to be lower in spex for an identical electron temperature .",
    "this makes limits of the temperature and normalization more difficult to determine in model  bs , since the temperature of the fe - ejecta component is mainly determined by the fe l - shell - to - k - shell intensity ratio .",
    "the elemental abundances of the first vnei component (  nei plasma \" in table  [ tab : best ] ) are moderately higher than the solar values , with the exception of mg , suggesting the origin of this component to be a mixture of the ejecta and swept - up ism .",
    "this interpretation will be discussed more quantitatively in section  [ ssec : fe ] .",
    "the distance to g344.70.1 is highly uncertain , despite its importance for determination of the snr s physical properties . it had once been estimated to be @xmath014  kpc from the @xmath91d relation ( dubner et al .",
    "1993 ) , but this phenomenological method is notoriously unreliable with large intrinsic dispersion . based on hi absorption and emission features possibly associated with the snr , @xcite recently estimated a distance of 6.3 ( @xmath92 )  kpc .",
    "however , this estimate is also uncertain ( see hayato et al .",
    "2010 and references therein for the case of the tycho s snr ) , and is suspected to be unreasonably small due to the following reasons .",
    "we have obtained a foreground absorption column density of @xmath18 = ( 4.55.4 ) @xmath93  @xmath27 ( table  [ tab : best ] ) , which is consistent with all previous results ( yamauchi et al .",
    "2005 ; combi et al .  2010 ;",
    "giacani et al .",
    "according to the dl map ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and the lab map ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , the _ total _ galactic hi column density @xmath94(hi ) toward the direction of g344.70.1 is given to be @xmath95  @xmath27 and @xmath96  @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "it is known that averaged number densities of molecular hydrogen and neutral atomic hydrogen are comparable with each other in the galactic plane , while that of ionized hydrogen is negligibly small ( e.g. , ferrire 2001 ) .",
    "we hence obtain a total galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath94(total ) = @xmath94(hi ) + 2@xmath94(h@xmath97 ) = ( 4.55.4 ) @xmath93  @xmath27 .",
    "this value is fully consistent with the measured absorption column for g344.70.1 , suggesting that the snr is situated near the opposite edge of the galactic plane , or at least farther than the galactic tangent point of this direction ( 8.2  kpc ; a distance to the galactic center is assumed to be 8.5  kpc ) .",
    "in fact , the distances to snrs ctb  37a ( g348.5 + 0.1 ) and ctb  37b ( g348.7 + 0.3 ) , located in a similar direction , are respectively known to be @xmath011  kpc ( reynoso & mangum 2000 ) and @xmath010  kpc ( caswell et al .  1975 ) , but have smaller @xmath18 values of ( 34 ) @xmath93  @xmath27 ( sezer et al .  2011 ; nakamura et al .",
    "although @xcite also performed similar estimates to support their claim , they assumed that 2/3 of the total galactic hydrogen ( and associated heavy elements ) is distributed in the snr s foreground .",
    "this assumption is quite unreasonable , given that the claimed distance of 6.3  kpc is closer than the galactic tangent point .",
    "therefore , the distance to the snr is assumed to be 14  kpc in the following discussion , even though this value is not definitive either .",
    "we have clearly detected strong fe k - shell emission and determined its origin to be the sn ejecta , for the first time .",
    "the fe ejecta can be characterized by a pure - metal plasma whose electron temperature and ionization timescale are different from those of the other plasma component with abundant @xmath2-elements ( i.e. , mg , si , s , ar , and ca ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the wideband x - ray spectrum , including the fe - k@xmath2 emission , can be well represented by a one - component ` vpshock ` model with @xmath19 = 1.17  kev and @xmath98 ( a maximum value of ionization timescales ) = @xmath99  @xmath42  s. however , photon statistics of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data are too low around the fe - k@xmath2 emission to independently determine its center energy .",
    "we found that the ` vpshock ` model applied by @xcite predicts an fe - k@xmath2 centroid of @xmath06.57  kev .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the energy derived from the _ suzaku _ spectra , and hence at least two components are absolutely needed .",
    "in addition to the plasma condition , the emitting volumes of both components are also likely to be different from each other ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "therefore , direct comparison of the abundances ( and hence masses ) among the fe and @xmath2-elements is not straightforward , although this comparison is the most credible way to distinguish the sn type .",
    "however , we should note that strong fe emission is observationally very common in type  ia snrs and is unusual in cc snrs ( e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "furthermore , the ionization timescale for the fe ejecta in g344.70.1 is found to be about one order of magnitude lower than that for the other elements ( table  [ tab : best ] ) , which is another typical characteristic of type  ia snrs ( hwang et al .",
    "1998 ; kosenko et al .",
    "2008 ; yamaguchi et al .  2008a ; badenes et al .  2003 ; 2007 ) .",
    "this can be explained by a stratified ejecta composition with fe in the interior that is theoretically expected ( e.g. , gamezo et al .",
    "2005 ; maeda et al .",
    "2010b ) and has also been confirmed by optical observations of standard type  ia sne ( e.g. , tanaka et al .",
    "although there are a few of well - established cc snrs ( e.g. , cas  a , w49b , and n132d ) that exhibit relatively strong fe k - shell emission , the fe is highly ionized in all of them , unlike in g344.70.1 and other type  ia snrs ( maeda et al .",
    "2009 ; ozawa et al .",
    "2009 ; xiao & chen 2008 ) .",
    "since highly - ionized atoms generally have higher emissivity than lowly - ionized ones , the large fe flux in these cc snrs is achieved even with relatively low abundance of this element .",

    "here , we compare these values with yields of different sn nucleosynthesis models . since the large hydrogen mass of @xmath100150@xmath101  implies that the snr is dominated by the swept - up ism , we take into account both the ejecta and ism contributions . the total observed mass of the hydrogen or heavy elements @xmath102",

    "therefore , we obtain @xmath111 for each element @xmath102 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] , we show the observed mass ratio @xmath112 of the different elements normalized by the solar values . on the other hand , theoretical values can be derived by substituting nucleosynthesis products of various sn models for @xmath105 and @xmath113 in equation  [ eq : mass ] .",
    "here we employ the type ia deflagration or delayed - detonation models ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) and the cc sn models with various progenitor masses ( kobayashi et al .",
    "the representative results of the comparison are shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] , where for @xmath109 we consider several values in the range of 0.51.0  solar .",
    "we find that the abundance pattern is broadly consistent with the type  ia models , but does not match with any cc models .",
    "we also considered several other nucleosynthesis models for cc sne ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ; thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) , and reached essentially the same conclusion . although our estimates of the element masses is largely affected by an assumed distance and a filling factor , we note that the enhanced abundance ratios of s / mg , ar / mg , and ca / mg can be explained only by an evolved type  ia sn .",
    "this is because no cc model predicts a mg abundance less than a half of the heavier @xmath2-elements abundances .",
    "a type  ia snr in a dense environment ( e.g. , near molecular clouds ) is quite rare ( e.g. , andersen et al .",
    "in fact , @xcite identified g344.70.1 as a cc snr , based on its spatial association with hi clouds possibly created by recent ( @xmath0@xmath114  yr ago ) star formation .",
    "@xcite was also supportive of its cc origin , since the strong asymmetry in its x - ray morphology was analogous to other cc snrs . however , these preceding works lacked statistically sufficient spectral information , especially of fe emission , that is so crucial in distinguishing sn types .",
    "similar situations have occurred with rcw  86 and n103b .",
    "rcw  86 was found to be evolving within a wind - blown bubble and thus suggested to be a cc snr ( vink et al .",
    "2006 ) . possible evidence of interaction with a molecular cloud was also pointed out in this snr ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "however , recent observations and a theoretical work strongly suggest its origin to be a type  ia sn ( williams et al .  2011 ;",
    "yamaguchi et al .",
    "n103b was also initially classified as a cc snr because of its proximity to the young star cluster ngc  1850b with an age of @xmath04  myr ( chu & kennicutt 1988 ; gilmozzi et al .",
    "1994 ) , but the _ asca _ and _ chandra _ spectra revealed its type  ia sn origin ( hughes et al .",
    "1995 ; lewis et al .",
    "moreover , badenes et al .  ( 2009 ) found that the progenitor was possibly associated with star formation at 50150  myr ago , suggesting no direct relationship between the snr s progenitor and ngc  1850b .",
    "it is worth noting that lewis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discovered that the ew maps of si and s k - shell emission exhibit nearly symmetric shell - like structure , in contrast to the strong east ",
    "west asymmetry in the line emission measure ( i.e. , plasma density ) . in the morphological study by @xcite ,",
    "the symmetry of g344.70.1 was investigated only with the broad x - ray band image , which can be biased by density inhomogeneity in the ambient ism .",
    "ew maps of specific elements could display an uncontaminated ejecta distribution , which could be more symmetric if g344.70.1 is indeed a type  ia remnant .",
    "this will be explored in our future work combining high - resolution images of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.    the point - like soft x - ray source cxou j170357.8414302 , located at the snr s geometrical center , has been suggested to be either a cco associated with the snr or a foreground k0 star @xcite . since our result suggests a type ia origin of g344.70.1 , the latter possibility is preferred .    from the morphological features in the radio and x - ray bands",
    ", g344.70.1 can be classified as a mixed - morphology ( mm ) snr ( rho & petre 1998 ; see also @xcite who revealed the complete shell structure in the radio including the faint eastern region ) . despite continuous efforts by a number of authors ( e.g. , white & long 1991 ; cox et al .",
    "1999 ; shelton et al .  1999",
    "; petruk 2001 ; slane et al .",
    "2002 ) , evolutionary characteristics which have led to the observed properties of mm snrs are not well understood .",
    "it should be noted that all the mm snrs for which progenitor types have been well identified are known to have cc origins .",
    "therefore , if our conclusion about the progenitor type of g344.70.1 is correct , this result would demonstrate that type  ia sne can also form remnants of this class@xmath115 .",
    "this may support an idea that the formation mechanism of this unusual morphology is not related to the nature of progenitors , but rather associated with their environment , as was assumed in the several previous works ( e.g. , white & long 1991 ; shelton et al .",
    "interestingly , recent _ suzaku _ observations have discovered overionized plasmas in several mm snrs ( e.g. , yamaguchi et al .",
    "2009 ; ozawa et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are quite different from the ionization conditions in g344.70.1 .",
    "future works are warranted to comprehensively understand the evolution of both the morphology and ionization in mm snrs .",
    "the ew of the fe - k@xmath2 emission is not uniform but is enhanced in the southeast region ( section  [ ssec : image ] ) . for more quantitative studies , we extracted spectra from two elliptical regions , `` se '' and  nw \" shown in figure  [ fig : image](f ) , and fitted with the same models as used in section  [ ssec : spectrum ]",
    ". the fe - k@xmath2 ews for se and nw are 5.1 ( @xmath116 )  kev and 3.3 ( @xmath117 )  kev , respectively . if the temperature of the fe ejecta is constant across the entire remnant , the surface brightness of the fe emission is approximately proportional to @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the ejecta density in the se region may be higher than that in the nw region by a factor of @xmath01.2 .",
    "an inhomogeneity of hot ejecta can arise from the interaction of snrs with nonuniform ambient matter , as was observed , for example , in kes  27 ( chen et al .",
    "2008 ) ; the reflected shock after the collision between the blast wave and dense ism can propagate backward and enhance the x - ray emission from the ejecta . in the case of g344.70.1 , however , no evidence of dense matter is found around the se region , but the nw rim is , in contrast , likely to have encountered a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the possible origins of the enhancement is an inhomogeneous ejecta distribution caused by an asymmetric sn explosion .",
    "the small asymmetry in @xmath5ni production with a density variation of factor @xmath01.2 is within the range that can be theoretically explained by an established delayed - detonation type ia sn model ( e.g. , maeda et al .",
    "alternatively , an overall se ",
    "nw temperature gradient can explain the inhomogeneity , but unfortunately , the electron temperature of the fe ejecta component is difficult to constrain because of the relative weakness of its bremsstrahlung flux ( see figure  [ fig : full2 ] ) .",
    "the emission line of he - like al at @xmath01.6  kev has clearly been detected .",
    "this is the first detection of this element in the x - ray spectrum of an extended celestial source .",
    "although we looked at spectra from several smaller regions of the snr , no spatial concentration of this emission was found .",
    "we also carefully repeated the analysis with different background regions and confirmed that the spectral feature is not due to inaccurate background subtraction .",
    "note that the intensity of neutral al emission in the intrinsic background of the xis is extremely low and stable compared to _ xmm - newton_/epic ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "we emphasize that this capability has enabled us to detect this emission robustly .",
    "_ chandra_/acis has a similarly low background level , but the effective area around this energy is about a factor of two smaller than that of the xis .",
    "the energy resolution is also lower in the acis , which makes detection of weak emission more difficult .",
    "since al emission line data are not available in the vnei code in xspec , we refer to atomdb and calculate the emissivity for the he - like al - k blend to estimate the al abundance , @xmath119 .",
    "the relation between the line flux @xmath120 and emissivity @xmath121 for he - like al is given as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number ratio of al to h in the solar ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "for the nei plasma with the best - fit @xmath19 and @xmath20 values for models  ax and bx ( table  [ tab : best ] ) , we obtain @xmath124 = @xmath125  @xmath126  s@xmath71 and @xmath127  @xmath126  s@xmath71 , respectively",
    ". therefore , the flux of the 1.6-kev gaussian corresponds to an al abundance of @xmath128  solar for model  ax and @xmath129  solar for model  bx , slightly higher than the solar value . since a type  ia sn scarcely produces al ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) , this abundance enhancement indicates either ( 1 ) the ambient ism has been enriched with al by preceding cc sne , or ( 2 ) the snr really has a cc origin against our argument in section  [ ssec : fe ] .",
    "we consider the former is the case as we discuss below .",
    "it has been suggested that chemical yields of @xmath130al and other neutron - rich elements in cc sne strongly depend on the metallicity of progenitor stars ( e.g. , kobayashi et al .",
    "this is because these elements are enhanced upon sn explosive nucleosynthesis by excess neutrons in @xmath131ne , which is transformed from @xmath132n during the he - burning phase of the progenitor ( see chapter  9 of arnett 1996 ) . since",
    "both mg and al arise from c / ne burning , the al - to - mg abundance ratio can be used to indicate the metallicity .",
    "in fact , a strong metallicity dependence of the al / mg ratio has been confirmed by several stellar observations ( gehren et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ; andrievsky et al .  2010 and references therein ) .",
    "notably , most stars with a sub - solar mg abundance ( mg / h = 0.51  solar ) exhibit enhanced al / mg values of 12  solar ( see figure  9 of andrievsky et al .",
    "2010 ) , suggesting that the al abundance in the sun is anomalously low ( and/or the mg abundance is high ) compared to galactic nearby stars . in metal - poor stars ( mg / h @xmath1330.1  solar ) , on the other hand",
    ", the al / mg ratio is depleted to less than 0.3  solar .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont ] shows confidence contours for the abundance of al relative to that of mg .",
    "we obtain the al / mg abundance ratios of @xmath134  solar and @xmath135  solar for models  ax and bx , respectively .",
    "the ratios are , furthermore , found to be higher than unity at @xmath13699% confidence in both cases and even more significant in the case of models  as and bs . to estimate systematic uncertainties , we fitted the spectra with the same plasma models but replaced the wabs component with an updated absorption model of wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ; tbabs ) where photon extinction by interstellar dust grains is additionally taken into account .",
    "we found that this change did not affect significantly the measurement of the al / mg ratio .",
    "we also repeated the spectral fitting by assuming different fe abundances in the `` nei plasma '' component ( which can be regarded as an fe abundance in the ism ) , and obtained no significant difference in the result .",
    "the enhanced relative abundance of al / mg as well as the slightly - depleted value of the absolute mg abundance are consistent with the chemical characteristics in the typical galactic stars .",
    "therefore , we propose that the mg and al emission from g344.10.7 originates predominantly from the blast - shocked ism with the metallicity of a solar - like value ( not less than 0.1  solar ) .",
    "the moderate metallicity of the ambient ism can be due to preceding cc sne in nearby regions .",
    "however , there is still a large difficulty in the abundance measurement of al due to the limited energy resolution ( see section  [ ssec : future ] ) , and thus future efforts are essential for more definitive conclusion .",
    "we have also found possible evidence of cr and mn emission .",
    "the centroids of these lines are fully consistent with those observed in tycho s snr ( tamagawa et al .",
    "we should note , however , that there are many sources of systematic uncertainties we have not yet taken into account .",
    "for instance , we simply assume a single - temperature plasma for the nei plasma component .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is , therefore , determined mainly by the k@xmath23/k@xmath2 intensity ratios of si and s , since these lines have a large number of photon statistics .",
    "if we allow multiple temperatures , which can be the case for most evolved snrs , the continuum level increases slightly around the cr and mn features .",
    "this results in slightly lower fluxes for the weak line components ; for example , adding another nei plasma with a different electron temperature to model  bx or bs , we obtained a @xmath020% lower flux of the cr - k@xmath2 emission .",
    "therefore , the detection of these features is still marginal , and we absolutely need deeper and higher energy - resolution observations to confirm their presence",
    ".    nevertheless , it would be meaningful to make a rough estimate of the mass ratio of mn to cr , because this ratio is suggested to be a good metallicity tracer for type  ia progenitors ( badenes et al .",
    "2008 ) for reasons similar to those mentioned above .",
    "the progenitor s metallicity should not necessarily be consistent with that of the swept - up ism ( i.e. , the source of mg and al ) , since the ism metallicity is likely to have been modified by recent cc sne after the type  ia progenitor had been created . using the best - fit values of model  bx ( table  [ tab : best ] ) , we derive the mn / cr flux ratio to be @xmath137 .",
    "given that the ionization states of both the elements are lower than he - like , similar to fe , the cr and mn ions are likely to be associated with the fe - rich plasma .",
    "thus , the electron temperature and ionization timescale should be in the ranges of 210  kev and ( 612)@xmath17@xmath56  @xmath42  s , respectively . according to figure  4 of badenes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the emissivity ratio of @xmath138/@xmath139 is estimated to be 0.50.75 .",
    "therefore , the mn - to - cr mass ratio is constrained in the range of 0.11.0 . since the relation between the mass ratio and progenitor s metallicity is given as @xmath140/@xmath141 = @xmath142 ( badenes et al .",
    "2008 ) , we obtain @xmath102 = 0.0020.07 .",
    "although the uncertainty is relatively large , this does not conflict with the single - degenarate scenario as a candidate for the type  ia progenitor system , where the metallicity must be higher than @xmath143 for the `` optically thick wind '' to be driven effectively ( kato & hachisu 1994 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 ) .       lines .",
    "the fwhm of 7  ev ( top ) or 4  ev ( bottom ) is assumed .",
    "resonance ( w ) , intercombination ( x+y ) , and forbidden ( z ) lines of al , and he - like mg - k@xmath23 line are clearly separated in the bottom .",
    "[ fig : sxs ] ]    finally , we briefly mention the remaining problems and prospect for future observations .",
    "although we have detected the possible feature of al emission , our abundance estimates is still inconclusive . with the energy resolution of semiconductor detectors ( e.g. , the xis ) ,",
    "the he - like al - k@xmath2 line is totally blended with the mg - k@xmath23 line , and both of them as well as the mg - k@xmath2 line are blended with fe l - shell emissions . since the l - shell emissivities are generally uncertain due to the limitation of atomic data , determination of the mg and al abundances can be systematically affected .",
    "interstellar dust scattering of x - ray photons out of the line of sight ( e.g. , draine 2003 ) and abundance inhomogeneity in the foreground ism , which were not taken into account in this paper , are potential additional sources of the uncertainties",
    ". moreover , nonuniform temperatures and ionization timescales , expected in evolved snrs such as g344.70.1 , also complicate the abundance measurement .    in 2014 ,",

    "( takahashi et al .  2010 ) will be launched and will carry a micro - calorimeter ( soft x - ray spectrometer : sxs ) with greater spectral resolution for diffuse objects than has been available with previous instruments .",
    "this will enable us to resolve the k - shell lines of mg and al from the fe l - shell lines and to measure the abundances much more accurately . in figure",
    "[ fig : sxs ] , we show examples of simulated spectra for the brightest part of g344.70.1 .",

    "2010 ) . in the case that the latter resolution is achieved , the fluxes of the al - k@xmath2 and mg - k@xmath23 lines can be determined almost independently .",
