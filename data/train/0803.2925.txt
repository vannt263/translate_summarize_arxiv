    "evolutionary algorithms ( eas ) are probabilistic search algorithms based on evolution @xcite .",
    "they operate by exploiting the information contained in a population of possible solutions ( via similarities between individuals ) .",
    "the aim is to find an individual that maximises ( or minimises ) an objective function , which maps from individuals to the real line .",
    "the population is transformed by first selecting individuals .",
    "mutation and/or recombination is then used to either replace a few individuals from the population or create an entirely new population .",
    "the most prevalent methods for selecting individuals are proportionate , linear rank , tournament , and truncation @xcite . in proportionate selection individuals are chosen with a probability proportional to their fitness ( the value of the objective function evaluated at the individual ) @xcite .",
    "a common method to gain more control over selection pressure , is to scale the fitness values before the selection is made @xcite .",
    "linear ranking proceeds by ordering the population according to their fitness .",
    "the chance that an individual is selected is then a linear function of its ( unique ) rank @xcite .",
    "tournament selection creates a tournament by randomly choosing @xmath0 individuals , the best individual in the tournament is then selected . for truncation selection the @xmath1 fittest individuals have uniform probability of selection , while the remainder have zero chance of being selected .",
    "the choice of selection scheme is crucial to algorithm performance .",
    "if the selection pressure is too high then diversity of the population decreases rapidly and the algorithm converges prematurely to local optima or worse . with too little pressure",
    "there is not enough push toward better individuals and the population takes too long to converge .",
    "many methods to choose or adapt the selection pressure or avoid the problem otherwise have been invented ( see @xcite for some references ) .",
    "a particularly simple one is fitness uniform selection , which uniformly selects a fitness value , and then the individual with fitness closest to this value .",
    "it is quite profitable to study selection schemes due to their generality .",
    "they depend only on the set of fitness values and not on the rest of the algorithm .",
    "hence their behaviour can be studied in isolation and the results applied to any evolutionary algorithm . in this paper",
    "we introduce and study generalizations of rank and tournament selection ( both actually only depend on the rank and not the absolute fitness value itself ) .",
    "linear ranking has a small range of selection pressures ( from @xcite , for a population of @xmath2 individuals the probability that the fittest individual is selected must be between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , but it has the flexibility of a real - valued parameter that can vary continuously ( the slope of the linear function ) .",
    "ranking schemes with high selection pressures , such as when the probability of selection is an exponential function of the rank , have occasionally been used @xcite .",
    "it is natural then to generalise from linear to polynomial functions to cover the instances where medium pressure is required .",
    "hence the probability of an individual with rank @xmath1 being selected with a polynomial rank scheme of degree @xmath5 is : [ eqpoly1 ] p(i = k)=_l=1^d+1 a_l k^l-1 where @xmath6 are parameters defined by the algorithm designer . for simplicity",
    "we assume that selection is performed with replacement and each individual has unique rank , however our results still hold when there are ties in the rank .",
    "the only restriction on the @xmath7 is that they must produce a proper probability distribution , i.e.  for a population of @xmath2 individuals : @xmath8 for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "hence , while the population is ordered , the schemes may favour low ranks , high ranks or neither , depending on the choice of the @xmath11 .",
    "this selection method encompasses the low pressures of linear schemes ( @xmath12 ) and can give good approximations of the high pressure exponential cases ( via taylor polynomials ) .",
    "furthermore the wealth of general knowledge about polynomials means that while it has numerous parameters ( coefficients of the monomials ) , it is also easy to predict their impact .",
    "tournament selection has a large range @xcite , but a discrete parameter , leaving the possible selection pressures somewhat restricted .",
    "this can be overcome by selecting probabilistically from the tournament , rather than always choosing the best in the tournament",
    ". however the extra parameters required are not easy to understand .",
    "their precise effect on the behaviour is not at all obvious .",
    "probabilistic tournament selection still only sorts @xmath13 individuals , making it much faster than any ranking scheme .",
    "let @xmath14 be the ( rank of the ) individual in position @xmath15 of the rank - ordered tournament .",
    "we call @xmath16 the _ seed _ of @xmath17",
    ". let @xmath18 be the probability that seed @xmath16 has rank @xmath1 . in any given tournament , the probability that the seed @xmath16 individual is chosen will be a user defined constant @xmath19 .",
    "then the probability of an individual @xmath1 being selected through a size @xmath0 probabilistic tournament is : [ eqtourn1 ] p(i = k)=_s=1^t _ s p(i_s = k ) standard ( deterministic ) tournament always selects the individual of highest rank in the tournament , i.e.  @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    to ensure that choosing a winner from the tournament makes sense",
    ", the @xmath19 must satisfy the probability constraints @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the tournament is created by random selection _ with _ replacement and for now that each individual in the population has a unique fitness .",
    "this defines @xmath18 ( section [ secpst ] ) .",
    "note that even if every individual in the population is unique , it is possible for it to be repeated in the tournament .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the equivalence between the generalised schemes and with the aim of providing a scheme that combines the superior understanding of polynomial rank with the speed of probabilistic tournament .",
    "bck @xcite found that an individual s chance of selection in deterministic tournament selection is a polynomial , hence each is equivalent to a polynomial rank selection method .",
    "wieczorek and czech @xcite , and blickle @xcite arrived at the same conclusion using a different method .",
    "so while the name ` polynomial rank selection ' is new , its concept is fairly old .",
    "the study of probabilistic tournaments is nt new either : hutter @xcite proved that every size @xmath24 probabilistic tournament is a linear rank scheme , and goldberg @xcite did the same but only for a continuous population .",
    "fogel @xcite applied to the traveling salesman problem , a variation wherein each individual underwent numerous t=2 tournaments .",
    "the probability of winning each tournament was dependent on the fitness of the individuals involved and the individuals selected were those with the highest number of wins .",
    "we extend these results by finding that every @xmath0 sized probabilistic tournament is equivalent to a polynomial rank scheme with a polynomial degree of @xmath25 or less ( section [ secpst ] ) .",
    "we continue on to show that the equivalence is unique ( section [ secunique ] ) , and give an explicit expression for the inverse map ( section [ secptot ] ) .",
    "this allows the establishment of simple criteria for polynomial rank schemes that are probabilistic tournaments ( section [ secpist ] ) .",
    "unfortunately not every possible polynomial rank scheme satisfies the criteria , but most ( and in the limit of an infinite population , all ) linear and most `` interesting '' quadratic ones are equivalent to probabilistic tournaments .",
    "this is good enough for all practical purposes , if it generalises to higher order polynomials .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the following notation . if not otherwise indicated , an index has the full range as defined in this table .",

    "in this section we find the probability of an individual being successful ( the winner ) via tournament selection .",

    "further , @xmath67 if and only if @xmath68 seeds have rank @xmath69 and @xmath70 seeds have rank @xmath71 , hence p(i_r k i_r+1>k ) = ( ) ^r(1-)^t - r since there are @xmath72 ways of choosing @xmath68 individuals with rank @xmath69 from @xmath0 individuals .",
