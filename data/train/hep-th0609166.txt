    "quark confinement is still an unsolved and challenging problem in theoretical particle physics , as is well known .",
    "though the approach to this problem is not unique , we have a promising scenario for explaining quark confinement , the so - called dual superconductivity picture @xcite for the vacuum of the non - abelian gauge theory @xcite .",
    "this scenario proposed long ago is intuitively quite appealing .",
    "indeed , the relevant data supporting the validity of this picture have been accumulated by numerical simulations especially since 1990 and some of the theoretical predictions @xcite have been confirmed by these investigations : infrared abelian dominance @xcite , magnetic monopole dominance @xcite and non - vanishing off - diagonal gluon mass @xcite in the maximal abelian gauge @xcite , which are the most characteristic features for the dual superconductivity . in spite of these facts ,",
    "the theoretical justification is not yet reached to a satisfactory level . in this paper , we demonstrate analytically the infrared abelian dominance in the wilson loop average for a large wilson loop of the su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite .    for this purpose , we need to answer how to define and extract `` abelian '' part @xmath3 from the original non - abelian gauge field @xmath4 , which is responsible for the area decay law of the wilson loop average .",
    "this must be done without spoiling gauge invariance .",
    "the conventional abelian projection @xcite is too naive to realize this requirement . in sec . 2 and 3",
    ", we achieve this goal by using a non - abelian stokes theorem and a non - linear change of variables ( nlcv ) .    at the same time",
    ", we must answer why the `` remaining '' part @xmath5 @xmath6 in the non - abelian gauge field @xmath4 decouple in the low - energy ( or long - distance ) regime . to answer this question , we argue in sec . 4 and 5 that the remaining part @xmath5 acquires the mass @xmath7 to be decoupled in the low - energy region .",
    "the fundamental mechanism for the @xmath5-mass generation is that the gauge - invariant composite operator @xmath8 develops a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath9 , in other words , the gauge - invariant dimension  two condensation takes place , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , it was recently proposed in @xcite and @xcite that dimension  two vacuum condensations composed of gluon field are relevant to the realization of quark confinement and the existence of mass gap in yang - mills theory .",
    "we also discuss some implications of dimension  two condensate @xmath9 for the low - energy description of yang - mills theory .    moreover , in sec .",
    "5 we point out that the existence of such a condensation stabilizes the vacuum of the savvidy type @xcite with the magnetic condensation by eliminating a tachyon mode causing the nielsen  olesen instability @xcite .",
    "this is a by - product of the above result .",
    "the stability of the magnetic vacuum is desirable for the magnetic monopole dominance .",
    "thus the non - perturbative yang - mills vacuum is characterized by two vacuum condensations , i.e. , the condensation @xmath10 and the magnetic condensation @xmath11 , both of which realize the vacuum energy lower than that of the perturbative vacuum .",

    "it was claimed that some care must be taken in using this version of nast @xcite . ] which does not include neither the path ordering along the loop nor the surface ordering in sharp contrast to the other versions @xcite of nast , at the price of an additional integration over all gauge transformations of the given non - abelian background field .",
    "the diakonov  petrov nast is nothing but a path integral representation of the wilson loop operator .",
