    "in our recent work @xcite and @xcite we have tried to define the concept of quasi - integrability for field theories in @xmath4 dimensions . the idea to introduce such a concept",
    "is based on observation that many processes described by field theories which are not integrable possess properties which are very close to those seen in integrable theories .",
    "thus , for example , in many processes involving scattering of ( soliton - like ) extended structures these structures do not alter significantly their shapes and the whole scattering process generates very little radiation .",
    "in fact , after developing the concept of quasi - integrability in @xcite we became aware of previous observations of elastic scattering of solitons in some non - integrable theories @xcite , which reinforces the relevance of the development of such concepts .    in our recent work we have looked in detail , both numerically and analytically , at the scattering of solitons in two classes of models in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , namely the generalized models of the sine gordon type as introduced by bazeia et al @xcite and the generalized models of the nonlinear schrdinger type ( in which the usual nls potential @xmath5 is generalized to @xmath6 ) .",
    "both models depend on a new parameter ( @xmath7 ) but when this parameter vanishes they become the familiar integrable models ( the sine - gordon and nls respectively ) .",
    "our numerical results have shown that , in contradistinction to the integrable cases , the integrability - like constraints hold only for some field configurations and that they hold for the field configurations involving the scatterings of two solitons .",
    "hence we have tried to formulate the concept by expanding the models around their integrable points and specializing the discussion by looking at field configurations involving two solitons .",
    "our results have then shown that some field configurations are very special ; namely , when the field configurations possessed an extra parity - like symmetry the models , for these configurations , possessed extra conserved quantities ( very much like their integrable cousins ) . for other configurations",
    "these quantities were not conserved but were very small - with the meaning of ` small ' very dependent on the field configuration and on the closeness of the model to being integrable . hence our views on quasi - integrability were very much tied up with these extra symmetries and this closeness .    to investigate this further",
    "we have decided to look at other topological models , in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ; to check whether this relation of the quasi - integrability to the symmetry of the field configuration holds also in other models .",
    "hence we have decided to look at this in three topological models , dependent on a free parameter @xmath7 , which for a specific value of this parameter ( namely @xmath8 ) reduce to the sine - gordon model .",
    "the models were constructed using the procedure discussed in @xcite , which , in fact , is a generalization of the procedure discussed in @xcite .",
    "the first two models are obtained by two different changes of variables from the field of the sine - gordon model . in each case",
    "the one soliton field configuration connects the vacua at 0 and @xmath9 . in one case",
    "there is a further vacuum at @xmath10 irrespective of the value of the free parameter @xmath7 while in the other one all other vacua depend on @xmath7 .",
    "hence the first model allows for the symmetry of the two - soliton field configuration while the second one does not .",
    "finally , we have considered also a third model , which depends on two parameters .",
    "when one of these two parameters is zero we have a situation like in the first class of models but when both parameters are nonzero we can study the transition from one regime to the other one and its effect on the properties of the anomaly .",
    "the solitons reflect in their scatterings and so their effects on the anomalies are restricted only to the period when they are close together .",
    "however , we can also look at the configurations resembling breathers of the sine - gordon model .",
    "such configurations involve one soliton and one anti - soliton which are bound together ( their energy is less than the energy of a soliton and an anti - soliton ) .",
    "hence they are always in interaction and during this interaction they radiate some energy .",
    "thus the time evolution of their anomalies is stronger and so they can tell us more of the relevance of our symmetry on quasi - integrability . hence in the sequel we look at such configurations in the third class of models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] presents our models , their properties and discusses their two soliton field configurations .",
    "section [ sec : analytical ] recalls our ideas on quasi - integrability and their relation to the symmetry of the two - soliton configuration .",
    "our ideas are then tested , as described in section [ sec : numerical ] , in numerical simulations of the scattering properties of two soliton configurations and time evolution of breather - like configurations .",
    "we show that they support our expectations that the anomaly effects are smaller in models with symmetry and more pronounced in the models in which this symmetry is broken .",
    "we finish the paper with further comments and some conclusions , given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the three classes of models we consider in this paper are based on the lagrangian density given by l=((_t ) ^2-(_x)^2)-v ( ) , where the potentials @xmath11 are conveniently chosen by the procedure discussed in @xcite , which we now briefly explain . following that procedure we take the field @xmath12 of the sine - gordon model , defined by the lagrangian l_sg=((_t ) ^2-(_x)^2)-v_sg ; v_sg=^2(2 ) the static one - soliton solutions of the sine - gordon model , given by = arc tan ( e^@xmath13 ) , are solutions of the so - called bps equation _",
    "x= indeed , any solution of is a solution of the static euler - lagrange equation associated to .",
    "suppose now we introduce a field @xmath14 as a given transformation of the sine - gordon field @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "then , it follows from that _",
    "x= with v@xmath14()^2v_sg= ^2 ( ) ^2 if one takes the theory with potential given by , then it follows that static solutions of are solutions of the static euler - lagrange equation associated to .",
    "therefore , the mapping @xmath15 , maps bps solutions of the sine - gordon model into bps solutions of the theory .    in this paper we shall consider three theories of the type , with potentials given by , for three particular choices of mappings @xmath15 , which we now describe .",
    "in the first class of models we perform the change of variables : @xmath12=. [ one.five ] where @xmath7 is a free parameter which has to satisfy @xmath16 and when @xmath8 we have the identity map , and so becomes the sine - gordon model .",
    "note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 . therefore , the three neighboring vacua of the sine - gordon model , namely , @xmath19 , will also be vacua of the new model .",
    "the same is not true however for the other sg vacua .",
    "the inverse of this change of variables is provided by = , a=1 + = [ one.six ] one can easily check that = therefore , our first class of theory is defined by the lagrangian with potential given by v_1@xmath14= ^2@xmath20 ^ 2 ^2 ( ) note that static one soliton solution of such a theory is given by ( [ one.five ] ) in which @xmath12 is given by . we provide in figure [ fig : plotv1 ] a plot of the potential for @xmath21 .    , given in , against @xmath14 for @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 is invariant under the change @xmath23 , but its infinite number of vacua are not equally spaced .",
    "therefore , a one - soliton solution tunneling between the vacua @xmath24 and @xmath25 have a mass which is different from , for instance , that of the one - soliton tunneling between the vacua @xmath25 and @xmath26.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]      in this case we make a change of variables : = ; = ; b=1 + where the choice of the parameter @xmath27 such that @xmath17 and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , one has = . and so our second class of theories is defined by the lagrangian with the potential being v_2@xmath14= ^2 ( ) again the static one soliton solution of this model is given by ( [ one.five ] ) in which @xmath12 is given by .",
    "we give in figure [ fig : plotv2 ] a plot of the potential for @xmath21 .",
    ", given in , against @xmath14 for @xmath21 .",
    "contrary to @xmath29 this potential @xmath30 is not invariant under the change @xmath23 , and its ( infinite number ) vacua are not equally spaced .",
    "therefore , the one - soliton solutions tunneling between neighbouring vacua do not have the same mass.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      given the very different behaviour of both models presented above , and given the numerical results which we obtained for them which will be discussed in section [ sec : numerical ] , we have decided to look also at a model which interpolates between the two of them . to study this in more detail",
    "we have decided to construct a third model ( with two parameters ) . this would allows us to study the transition from one behaviour to the other as we change the parameters .",
    "we then introduce the third class of models based on the change of variables @xmath14=. where c= , the parameter @xmath31 was chosen such that @xmath17 and @xmath28 .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it then follows that the third class of theories is defined by the lagrangian with the potential being given by v_3()= ^2(2 ( ) ) , where @xmath34 is given by .",
    "note that when @xmath35 the model possesses the symmetry @xmath36 , which will be desirable for quasi - integrability as we discuss it further in the paper .",
    "then the @xmath37 case resembles a little the first class models given by the potential .",
    "the case where @xmath38 we do not have any symmetry and so the model is more like the models of the second class , given by the potential . when @xmath8 , the parameter @xmath33 becomes irrelevant and we have the sine - gordon model .",
    "consequently , this third class of models is a good place to study the transition mentioned above .    , given in , against @xmath14 for @xmath21 , with @xmath35 for the left plot , and @xmath39 for the right plot .",
    "note that this class of potentials interpolates between the first class ( for @xmath35 ) and the second class ( for @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath35 , @xmath41 is symmetric under the change @xmath23 , but not for other values of @xmath33 , and as long as @xmath42 , the infinite number of vacua are not equally spaced , leading to one - soliton solutions of different masses.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "next we perform an analytical study of the properties of our models using the techniques usually employed in integral field theories to construct quantities which are quasi - conserved as will be explained below .",
    "we follow the ideas put forward in our previous works on quasi - integrability @xcite .",
    "we consider a scalar field theory for a real scalar field @xmath14 in a generic potential @xmath43 . as in @xcite",
    "we introduce the lax potentials , based on a @xmath44 loop algebra : a_+&= & , + a_-&= & b_-1 - _ - f_0 , where we have used light - cone variables x_=@xmath45 _ = _ t_x _ + _",
    "-=_t^2-_x^2 ^ 2 .",
    "the @xmath44 loop algebra generators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined in the appendix [ sec : appendix - algebra ] , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are free parameters which do not appear in the lagrangian or the equations of motion of the theory .",
    "one can easily check that the curvature of the connection is given by f_+-_+a_--_-a_++a_+ , a_-= x f_1 -f_0 with x = _ - .",
    "note that when the equations of motion , following from , are satisfied , _ i.e. _ ^2 + = 0 the term proportional to the lie algebra generator @xmath50 vanishes .",
    "in addition , the quantity @xmath51 vanishes for the sine - gordon potential v_sg= if one chooses the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath48 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the curvature vanishes for the sine - gordon theory , and that is what makes this theory an integrable field theory in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "for any other choice of the potential @xmath43 , however , the curvature does not vanish .",
    "following the steps given in @xcite now analyze what can be said about conservation laws in a theory with non - vanishing @xmath51 , or equivalently @xmath54 .",
    "we start by recalling the fact that the generator @xmath55 is a semi - simple element in the sense that its adjoint action splits the @xmath44 loop algebra @xmath56 into its kernel and image as follows : = ker + i m , b_-1 , ker=0,=b_-1 , g with the important property that @xmath57 and @xmath58 have no common elements .",
    "an important ingredient of the method is that our @xmath44 loop algebra @xmath56 is graded by the grading operator @xmath59 ( see appendix [ sec : appendix - algebra ] for details ) , with the integer grades @xmath60 being determined as = _ ng_n ; g_m , g_n_m+n ; d , g_n= n g_n .",
    "next we perform a gauge transformation a_a_=g",
    "a_g^-1-_g g^-1 with the group element @xmath61 being an exponentiation of generators lying in the positive grade subspace generated by the @xmath47 s , _",
    "i.e. _ , g = exp ^(n)=_n f_n and @xmath62 , being the parameters of the transformation , which will be determined as we will explain below . under the curvature",
    "transforms as f_+-gf_+-g^-1=_+a_--_-a_++a_+ , a_-= x g f_1g^-1 , where we have used the equations of motion to drop the term proportional to @xmath50 in .",
    "the component @xmath63 of the connection has terms with grades @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , under it gets transformed into @xmath66 which has terms with grades ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath67 .",
    "decomposing @xmath66 into grades we get from and that a_-&=&b_-1 + & -&b_-1 , f^(1)- _ - f_0 + & -&b_-1 , f^(2 ) + b_-1 , f^(1 ) ,",
    "f^(1 ) - _ - f^(1 ) , f_0 -_-f^(1 ) + & & + & -&b_-1 , f^(n)+  .",
    "next we note that we can make the component of @xmath66 in the direction of @xmath68 vanish by choosing the parameters @xmath62 .",
    "in fact we can do this recursively .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 , and so on .",
    "thus our gauge transformation has rotated the component @xmath66 into the abelian subalgebra generated by the @xmath70 s .",
    "note that in this procedure we have not used the equations of motion .",
    "thus a_-=b_-1+_n=0^a_-^(2n+1 ) b_2n+1",
    "next we note that , even when the equations of motion are used , the component @xmath71 of the connection does not get rotated into the abelian subalgebra generated by the @xmath70 s ( _ i.e. _ the kernel ) , as it has components in the image too , _",
    "i.e. _ it is of the form : a_+=_n=0^a_+^(2n+1 ) b_2n+1 + _ n=2^ c_+^(n)f_n .",
    "it turns out that the coefficients @xmath72 are all proportional to @xmath51 , given in , and so they vanish for the sine - gordon theory . as we shall see below this vanishing of @xmath51",
    "is what is responsible for the integrability of the sine - gordon theory as it possesses an infinite set of exact conservation laws .",
    "the next step of our procedure , as discussed in @xcite involves the decomposition of the curvature into two components , one lying in the abelian subalgebra generated by @xmath70 s and the other lying in the subspace generated by @xmath47 s .",
    "thus , gf_1g^-1=_n=0^ ^(2n+1 ) b_2n+1 +    since @xmath71 lies in the kernel it follows that the commutator @xmath73 does not produce terms in the kernel .",
    "therefore , the terms in the direction of the @xmath70 s of the transformed curvature lead to the equations of the form _",
    "+ a_-^(2n+1)-_-a_+^(2n+1)= x^(2n+1)n=0,1,2 ,  with the anomaly @xmath51 given in .",
    "if we rewrite this using @xmath74 and @xmath75 variables we find that takes the form @xmath76 , and so we find that ( see ) = -^(2n+1)+ a_t^(2n+1)_x=-^x= , where q^(2n+1)_-^dxa_x^(2n+1),^(2n+1)_-^dxx^(2n+1 ) .    for finite energy solutions the fields @xmath14 have to go to a vacuum configuration at spatial infinity and , in general , this condition is enough for the values of @xmath77 at @xmath78 to be equal .",
    "therefore , the non - conservation of the charges is due to the non - vanishing of the anomalies @xmath79 , and so of the non - vanishing of the quantity @xmath51 given in .    to proceed",
    "further we introduce the following order two automorphism of the @xmath44 loop algebra @xmath70=- b_2n+1,@xmath80=-f_2n , @xmath81=f_2n+1 which is , in fact , the same as @xmath82=-t_3,@xmath83=-t _ since the so - called spectral parameter @xmath84 of the loop algebra is not affected by @xmath85 ( see the appendix [ sec : appendix - algebra ] ) . at the same time",
    "we introduce the space - time parity transformation p:@xmath86@xmath87 = x - x _ = t - t _ , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants which , as we will see later , are determined by the particular solution under consideration .",
    "even though the values of these constants vary from a solution to a solution , the argument we are presenting is independent of their values .",
    "next we make an important hypothesis that will have to be verified for each particular solution of the equations of motion that we want to study .",
    "we assume that , under the parity @xmath90 , the scalar field @xmath14 , evaluated on the solution under consideration , transforms as -+const .",
    "thus , from , we see that @xmath91=-a_- p@xmath63=a_- and so @xmath63=-a_- p.    next we take the even part of under @xmath92 and split it in its grade components . from the first line of we find that @xmath93a_-_-1= 0 .",
    "the second line of then implies that @xmath93a_-_0= -b_-1 , @xmath94f^(1 ) .",
    "note that , since we have rotated @xmath66 into the @xmath57 , the l.h.s .",
    "of has to lie in this @xmath57 .",
    "however , the r.h.s . of lies in the @xmath58 . therefore both sides have to vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath93a_-_0=0,@xmath94f^(1)=0 . note also , using the fact that @xmath95 is even under @xmath92 , that the third line of gives @xmath93a_-_1= -b_-1 , @xmath94f^(2 ) and so using the same arguments as above we see that @xmath93a_-_1=0,@xmath94f^(2)=0 .",
    "these arguments can now be repeated and so wee that all @xmath96 are even under @xmath92 and so , in consequence , the group element performing the gauge transformation satisfies @xmath61=g .",
    "the killing form of the @xmath44 loop algebra is given by @xmath97= c _",
    "2@xmath98 + 2,0,@xmath99=0 for some constant @xmath31 .",
    "thus , using , we find from that ^(2n+1)= tr@xmath100 = - tr@xmath101f_1@xmath102 b_-2n-1 and so p@xmath103=-",
    "tr@xmath104f_1@xmath102 b_-2n-1 = - tr@xmath100 = -^(2n+1 ) .",
    "next we make our second hypothesis that will have to be verified for each particular potential ; namely , that the quantity @xmath51 defined in satisfies p@xmath51=x .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , if the potential @xmath105 , evaluated on the solution , is even under the parity @xmath90 given in .",
    "if this is true it then follows that _",
    "-t_0^t_0 dt_-x_0^x_0 dx x ^(2n+1)=0 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are any given fixed values of the shifted time @xmath108 and space coordinate @xmath109 , respectively , introduced in .",
    "it this is the case thenh , by taking @xmath110 , we conclude that the non - conserved charges satisfy the following mirror time - symmetry around the point : @xmath89 .",
    "q^(2n+1)@xmath111=q^(2n+1)@xmath112 n=0,1,2 , ",
    "another infinite set of quasi - conserved charges , satisfying , can be constructed by a connection like that given in but with @xmath113 and @xmath114 exchanging roles , and the grades changing sign .",
    "then one performs a gauge transformation like in but with the group element @xmath61 being an exponentiation like in but involving negative grade generators @xmath115 .",
    "see @xcite for the details of that construction .    summarizing , we conclude that    1 .",
    "if we have a two - soliton - like or a breather - like solution of the equations of motion , transforming under the space - time parity as in , _",
    "i.e. _ p@xmath14= -+const .",
    "if the potential , evaluated on such a solution is even under the parity , _",
    "i.e. _ p@xmath105=v such that holds true , 3 .",
    "then we have an infinite set of conserved quantities which are conserved asymptotically , _",
    "i.e. _ q^(2n+1)@xmath116=q^(2n+1)@xmath117 .",
    "so , the values of these charges in the infinite past , before the scattering of the solitons , are the same as in the infinite future , after the scattering . for the breather solutions such charges",
    "are symmetric by reflection around @xmath118 ( see ) , and in fact oscillate in time .",
    "theories possessing such properties we call _ quasi - integrable _ theories .      here",
    "we analyze under what circumstances one can satisfy the conditions given above and so have _ quasi - integrability_. we by start looking at the properties of the two - soliton and breather solutions of the sine - gordon model .",
    "for the potential the equation of motion becomes the sine - gordon equation ^2_0+@xmath119=0 .",
    "the two - soliton solution of is given by _",
    "0= arctan , where the @xmath120 function is given by _ 0 = 1 +",
    "i e^_1+i e^_2- e^_1+_2 with _",
    "i = _ i i=1,2 and = @xmath121 ^ 2_1_2 and where @xmath122 , for kink and anti - kink . here , @xmath123 ,",
    "is the velocity ( in units of the speed of light ) of the kink ( anti - kink ) @xmath124 .",
    "note that we can write the solution as _ 0=arctan @xmath125 , where and z_+= + , z_-= , = .",
    "note also that as @xmath126 and @xmath127 are linear functions of @xmath74 and @xmath75 they can be taken as new coordinates of the space - time .",
    "they are , of course , independent of each other due to the fact that in a two - soliton solution we can never put @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , if that happens the two - soliton solution reduces to a one - soliton solution for the case @xmath129 , and one gets a divergent factor ( @xmath130 ) , for @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , we see from that _ 0= = , _ 0= = - .    thus , under the space - time parity transformation p:@xmath132@xmath133 we see that @xmath134 , and so , taking the domain of @xmath135 to be @xmath136 , we have that p@xmath137=-_0 + . in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 the parity transformation takes the form of with x_&= & , + t_&=&.    from we note that the even and odd components of @xmath137 are given by _ 0^()@xmath138@xmath137 , _ 0^(-)=_0- ; _ 0^(+)= note also that @xmath139 and so we see that @xmath140 and @xmath141 are both solutions of the sine - gordon equation , _",
    "i.e. _ ^2_0^()+@xmath142=0 . in fact , @xmath141 is a vacuum solution and @xmath140 is a proper two - soliton solution ( with @xmath137 being given by ) .",
    "the moving breather solution of the sine - gordon equation is also obtained from a tau function , thorough , given by @xcite _ 0 = 1+e^2_r + 2i@xmath143 e^_r _ i , with _",
    "r = @xmath144 , _ i = @xmath145 .",
    "so , from one gets that _ 0 = arctan , where @xmath146 is the speed of the breather , and @xmath147 is its frequency ( in its rest frame ) .",
    "note that the argument of @xmath135 in never diverges and so @xmath137 never passes through @xmath148 .",
    "thus , for the breather solution it is more convenient to take the domain of @xmath135 to be @xmath149 .",
    "we now introduce the space - time parity transformation p : @xmath150@xmath151 and comparing it with we see that in this case @xmath152 . under this parity transformation ,",
    "the breather solution is odd , _ i.e. _ p@xmath137=-_0 so , in the breather case we see that _ 0^()@xmath138@xmath137 _ 0^(-)=_0 ; _ 0^(+)=0 and so @xmath140 and @xmath141 are again both solutions of the sine - gordon equation , with the first being the breather itself and the second a trivial vacuum solution .",
    "we start by observing that the sine - gordon potential is invariant under and .",
    "therefore , the sine - gordon theory satisfies the requirements and , for quasi - integrability , within the two - soliton and breather sector , as it should , since it is an exact integrable field theory .",
    "we now discuss the conditions under which the theories , which are smooth deformations of the sine - gordon , should satisfy to be called quasi - integrable .",
    "we shall restrict our attentions to the theories of the previous section ; _ i.e. _ to theories with equations of motion given by , where the potential @xmath105 is a smooth deformation of the sine - gordon potential , in the sense that @xmath105 depends upon a parameter @xmath32 such that for @xmath153 , @xmath105 becomes . in order to perform the expansion around the sine - gordon model",
    "we shall work with two - soliton and breather solutions which are odd under the parity .",
    "we will also expand the field @xmath14 , as a solution of , in a power series in @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e. _ = _ 0^(-)+ _ 1+^2_2+  .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath105 depends upon @xmath32 explicitly , and also implicitly through @xmath14 .",
    "then the taylor expansion around @xmath153 of its first derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 takes the form & = & _ = 0 + _ = 0 +  + & = & _ = 0 + _ = 0 + & + & _ = 0 ^2 +     in consequence , splitting in powers of @xmath32 we find that @xmath137 satisfies the sine - gordon equation .",

    ".    note that if one expands @xmath105 in powers of @xmath32 , taking into account only its explicit dependence on @xmath32 and neglecting its implicit dependence on @xmath32 through @xmath14 , one gets that v= v_=0 + _",

    "in fact this is true in all models which involve deformations as discussed in @xcite as for all of them @xmath156 .",
    "thus the approach of @xcite guarantees .",
    "we now split into the even and odd parts under the parity @xmath90 , as ^2 _",

    "thus we see that for the theories described by the potential @xmath29 , given in , and the potential @xmath41 , given in , for @xmath37 , the even part ( under the parity ) of the first order field @xmath160 satisfies homogeneous equations , and the odd part of the first order field @xmath160 satisfies non - homogeneous equations , _",
    "i.e. _ ^2 _ 1^(+)+ _ = 0 _ 1^(+)&= & 0 , + ^2 _ 1^(-)+ _ = 0 _ 1^(- ) & & 0 v_1 v_3_=0 .",
    "thus , for such cases , one can always choose @xmath161 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath160 is a solution , so is @xmath162 .",
    "one can also check the if the choice @xmath161 is made , then it turns out the for theories governed by @xmath29 and @xmath163 the second order field @xmath164 has similar properties , _",
    "i.e. _ its even part under the parity satisfies homogenous equations , and its odd part non - homogeneous equations .",
    "so , one can similarly take @xmath165 .",
    "continuing this process one reaches the conclusion that it is always possible to have two - soliton - like and breather - like solutions for the theories with potentials @xmath29 and @xmath163 , which are odd under the parity @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , one can check that when evaluated on such odd solutions the potentials @xmath29 and @xmath163 are even under the parity @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , such theories satisfy the requirements and and so they possess an infinite number of charges satisfying the property , _",
    "i.e. _ such theories are , using our definition , _ quasi - integrable_.    the same argument does not apply to the theories governed by the potentials @xmath30 and @xmath166 , and so they can not be considered quasi - integrable . of course , it still may be the case , that they satisfy for other reasons .",
    "to perform the numerical simulations to check our hypothesis we still have to construct two - soliton configurations in our models .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we want to analyze the quasi - conservation of the first non - trivial charge beyond the energy itself , _",
    "i.e. _ the charge @xmath167 defined in .",
    "we do this by computing the corresponding anomaly @xmath168 also introduced in .",
    "one can check that the factor @xmath169 entering in the definition of @xmath168 is given by ( see @xcite ) ^(3)= i _ -^2 with @xmath170 .",
    "thus , using and , one finds that ^(3)=-8 _ -^ dx _ - _ -^2 , where we have chosen @xmath171 and @xmath52 , which are the values that make @xmath51 vanish when @xmath105 is the sine - gordon potential ( see comments around ) . we also want to compute the so - called integrated anomaly given by ( see ) ^(3)= -_t_0^t dt^ ^(3 ) = q^(3)@xmath75- q^(3)@xmath172 , where @xmath172 is the initial time of the simulation , usually taken to be zero .",
    "it is easy to check for the potentials of the form one has that + 16 v-1=2v_0 + 3 , [ two.aa ] where @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "note that in the case of the sine - gordon potential , which corresponds to @xmath175 and so @xmath176 , one sees that this quantity indeed vanishes .",
    "our numerical simulations were performed using the 4th order runge - kutta method of simulating time evolution .",
    "we experimented with various grid sizes and numbers of points and most simulations were performed on lattices of 10001 lattice points with lattice spacing of 0.01 ( so they covered the region of ( -50.0,50.0 ) .",
    "time step @xmath177 was 0.0001 .",
    "the solitons ( for the soliton - soliton scattering ) were placed at @xmath178 and stretched @xmath179 from their positions hence at the edges of the grid the fields resembled the vacuum configurations which were modified only by waves that were emitted during the scattering .",
    "the same was true for the breather - like structures - except that this time the field configurations were different from their vacuum values only for a very small range of @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath180 ) .",
    "at the edges of the grid ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath181 ) we absorbed the waves reaching this region ( by decreasing the time change of the magnitude of the field there ) .    in consequences , the total energy was not conserved but the only energy which was absorbed was the energy of radiation waves .",
    "hence the total energy was effectively the energy of the field configuration which we wanted to study .",
    "as we will discuss later in this section the energy was very well conserved in all soliton - soliton scatterings and much less so for the evolution of our breather - like structures .",
    "for the first model we note that we can put one soliton @xmath12 to lie between ( @xmath182 and the second one to lie between @xmath183 . thus our initial condition is given by ( @xmath184 stands for the initial field configuration ) f= , [ two.eleven ] where g =- arctanx<0 [ two.twelve ] and g = arctanx>0 , [ two.thirteen ] and where @xmath185 .",

    "the results are presented in fig [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "we note that this time the nonintegrated anomaly behaves very differently .",
    "not only it stayed of only one sign but is in fact maximal when the tso solitons come to rest before reflecting .",
    "hence , the integrated anomaly changes dramatically when the two solitons are very close together .",
    "this was the reason why we decided to look at the possible behaviours of the unintegrated anomaly for a more general class of models and we have introduced the third model .",
    "we then calculated the anomalies in the third class models and performed many simulations for many values of @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "for most values the results were qualitatively the same as in the previous models but for ranges of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath33 we observed the transfer of behaviour from the model with approximate symmetry to the one in which this symmetry is broken . in fig .",
    "[ fig8]-[fig11 ] we illustrate this transfer .",
    "as we increase the values of @xmath33 the unintegrated anomaly becomes asymmetric leading to the change of total anomaly .",
    "figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] show that this symmetry can be broken in either direction ( depending on the sign of @xmath33 ) .",
    "but for the third model .",

    "our numerical results show this very clearly ; anomaly changes significantly when the solitons are close together .    on the other hand when we consider breather - like configurations ( _ i.e. _ trapped pairs of a soliton and an antisoliton ) they constantly interact with each other and so the anomalies change all the time . whether their behaviour is consistent with our anomaly behaviour for breather like objects can be studied numerically too and we have performed several simulations in the third class of models .    to start the simulations we took a breather configuration for the sine - gordon model and then perfomed the change of variables to obtain the corresponding @xmath14 field .",
    "we then used this field and its derivative at @xmath200 as the initial conditions for the simulations .",
    "we have performed several simulations for different values of the frequency of the breather _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath216 in and for various values of @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "most of our simulations were performed for @xmath217 .",
    "these simulations have shown that , indeed , for @xmath218 we have quasi - integrability , _",
    "i.e. _ the behaviour is consistent with .",
    "the anomaly does change all the time and even the time integrated anomaly does depend on time . however , the oscillations are approximately around a fixed value and so , shifting in time and choosing @xmath89 appropriately we see that holds .",
    "when we take small @xmath33 the effects are not very different ( _ i.e. _ one should wait long enough to see the difference but for larger values of @xmath33 the effects are clear as the time integrated anomaly decreases .",
    "this is true for positive and negative values of @xmath38 . in fig",
    "[ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] we present results of our simulations for @xmath217 for @xmath219 and three values of @xmath33 , namely @xmath220 ( fig [ fig13 ] ) , @xmath221 ( fig [ fig14 ] ) and @xmath222 in fig [ fig15 ] .",

    "as is well known the modified sine - gordon models do not possess breather solutions except for the sine - gordon case .",
    "thus , for all values of @xmath7 the breather - like structures we have looked at gradually decay .",
    "this decay is carried out by the emission of radiation during the repetitive scattering of soliton and antisoliton forming the breather ( _ i.e. _ the breathing of the breather - like configuration ) .",
    "clearly , the speed of this decay , depends on @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "it also depends on @xmath216 - the frequency of the breather - like structure .",
    "we have studied this dependence and have observed that for ( for a given @xmath216 ) the energy of the configuration decreases with the increase of @xmath7 ( it decreases by a factor of 3 from @xmath201 to @xmath224 ) . at the same time , for a given @xmath7 and @xmath216 it increases with the increase of @xmath33 and , like for the pure sine - gordon model , for a given @xmath7 and @xmath33 it decreases with the increase of @xmath216 .",
    "these dependences have very important implications for the decay of the studied breather - like structures .",
    "thus , in particular , if one keeps @xmath216 and @xmath7 fixed the increase of @xmath33 speeds up the decay of the structure , which for low values of @xmath33 takes place gradually , while above a certain value of @xmath33 happens quite suddenly .",
    "the value at which this happens depends on @xmath7 and decreases with the increase of @xmath33 .    in fig .",
    "19 we present some preliminary plots of the decrease of the energy of two such breather - like configurations ( both for @xmath217 and @xmath201 ; one for @xmath221 ( the left hand - one ) and one for @xmath222 .",
    "they show the faster decrease of the configuration with @xmath38 .",
    "in this paper we have performed further studies of quasi - integrability - based on the observation @xcite , @xcite that the anomaly , which distinguishes integrable models from nonintegrable ones , also vanishes in some nonintegrable models in which the field configurations possess the parity symmetries discussed in section 3 .",
    "this observation was originally made in some very specific models and here we have tried to assess its general validitity .",
    "so , we constructed three classes of models ( one with symmetry , one without it and one ( dependent on two parameters ) which would allow us to interpolate between the two .",
    "our results have confirmed the validity of our assumption ( and so extended the class of models in which our observation holds ) and have also allowed us to study the way the anomaly varies as we move away from the models with this extra symmetry .",
    "our work has also led us to look more clearly at breather - like configurations .",
    "such configurations depend on many parameters and in this paper we have concentrated our attention at looking at the behaviour of such configurations when the symmetry is present and when it is absent . however , the symmetry is only one interesting topic to investigate for the breather - like configurations .",
    "one could look at the aspects of the decay of such configurations and the dependence of this behaviour of various parameters of these configurations .",
    "we plan to look at this next and we hope to be able to report on this in not too distant future .",
