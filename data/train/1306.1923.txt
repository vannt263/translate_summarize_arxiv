    "moreover , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are uniquely determined , the @xmath20 up to order .    the real and complex cases are known . there is a short proof for the quaternionic case involving universal real @xmath2-algebras .",
    "we present this proof in the next section .",
    "the _ principal angles _ between the range of @xmath9 and the range of @xmath10 in @xmath21 are @xmath22    we can make sense of `` principle vectors '' if we consider a subspace of @xmath21 as a subspace of @xmath23 that is closed under the anti - unitary symmetry @xmath24\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } -\\overline{\\mathbf{w}}\\\\ \\overline{\\mathbf{v } } \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] in terms of dyson s three - fold way @xcite , we are discussing class aii .",
