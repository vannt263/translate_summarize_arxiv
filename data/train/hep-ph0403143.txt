    "<S> many extensions of the standard model have to face the problem of new unsuppressed baryon - number violating interactions . in supersymmetry , the simplest way to solve this problem is to assume r - parity conservation . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the lightest supersymmetric particle becomes stable and a well - motivated dark matter candidate . in this paper , we show that solving the problem of baryon number violation in non supersymmetric grand unified theories ( gut s ) in warped higher - dimensional spacetime can lead to a stable kaluza  klein particle . </S>",
    "<S> this exotic particle has gauge quantum numbers of a right - handed neutrino , but carries fractional baryon - number and is related to the top quark within the higher - dimensional gut . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of baryon - number and @xmath0 color ensures its stability . </S>",
    "<S> its relic density can easily be of the right value for masses in the 10 gev  few tev range . </S>",
    "<S> an exciting aspect of these models is that the entire parameter space will be tested at near future dark matter direct detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> other exotic gut partners of the top quark are also light and can be produced at high energy colliders with distinctive signatures .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting aspects of the dark matter puzzle ( that @xmath1 of the matter in the universe is nonbaryonic and of yet - unknown nature ) is that it is likely to be related to new physics at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , particles with weak scale size interactions and a mass at the electroweak breaking scale ( wimps ) are typically predicted to have the good relic density today to account for dark matter , provided that they are stable . </S>",
    "<S> the hope is that through the confrontation of collider experiments , table - top direct searches , neutrino telescope and other cosmic ray detector experiments , dark matter ( dm ) will soon reveal itself and with it the first pieces of evidence for new physics at the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the favorite dm candidate to date is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with conserved r - parity . </S>",
    "<S> r - parity is not imposed just for the purpose of having a dm candidate but as the simplest solution to baryon number conservation in the supersymmetric theory . as a very appreciated spin - off , one gains a stable dm candidate .    lately , alternative models for physics beyond the sm that make use of extra dimensions rather than supersymmetry to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , have been suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the one which attracted much attention being the randall  sundrum ( rs1 ) model @xcite , where the hierarchy between the electroweak ( ew ) and the planck scales arises from a warped higher dimensional spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> variants of the original set - up have matured over the years . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , all sm fields except the higgs ( to solve the hierarchy problem , it is sufficient that just the higgs or alternative dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking be localized at the tev brane ) have been promoted to bulk fields rather than brane fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has been realized that placing gauge fields in the bulk could lead to high scale unification because of the logarithmic running of gauge couplings in ads@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , allowing fermions to propagate along the extra dimension offers a simple attractive mechanism for explaining the structure of yukawa couplings without introducing hierarchies at the level of the 5-dimensional action @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been shown that ew precision constraints are much ameliorated if the ew gauge symmetry is enhanced to @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ads / cft correspondence suggests that this model is dual to a strongly coupled cft higgs sector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the @xmath4 gauge symmetry in the rs bulk implies the presence of a global custodial isospin symmetry of the cft higgs sector , thus protecting ew observables from excessive new contributions @xcite . this gauge structure in warped space </S>",
    "<S> has also been used to construct higgsless models of ew symmetry breaking @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our qualitative results will apply to these models as well .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the remaining phenomenological issues which has not been addressed in rs is the dm puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> no generic wimp dark matter candidate has been identified yet . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to consider the possibility of kaluza  </S>",
    "<S> klein dark matter @xcite , so far restricted to models with flat tev@xmath5 universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , in warped geometries . in ued , the lightest kaluza  </S>",
    "<S> klein particle ( lkp ) can be stable because of kk parity , a remnant of translation invariance along the extra dimension , after the orbifold projection has been implemented . </S>",
    "<S> note that for kk parity to be an exact symmetry , one has to assume that the boundary lagrangians at the two orbifold fixed points are symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> a feature of models with flat toroidal tev@xmath5 extra dimensions ( not necessarily ued ) is the presence of a light gravitationally coupled radion , typically expected to have a mass in the mev range @xcite . because its lifetime well exceeds the age of the universe , it was shown in @xcite that such light radion generically leads to cosmological catastrophy like overclosure of the universe by radion oscillations . to avoid this problem </S>",
    "<S> , one has to ensure a radion stabilisation mechanism allowing for a larger radion mass . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , this problem does not arise in rs geometry where the radion field has an ew mass and couples strongly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cosmology of rs has attracted tremendous interest . in particular , it was shown that standard friedmann cosmology can be recovered @xcite and normal expansion is expected at least up to a tev temperatures above which a phase transition occurs where the tev brane is replaced by an event horizon @xcite . as far </S>",
    "<S> as wimp dark matter is concerned , we do not rely on what happens at these high temperatures since the freeze out temperature is typically a few tens of gev and we can safely make a standard cold dark matter relic density calculation in the rs context .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , there is no translational invariance in rs geometry , hence there is no analog of kk parity conservation . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the stability of a light kk mode will be related to baryon number symmetry . in rs , </S>",
    "<S> dominant baryon number violation arises through effective four fermion interactions localized near the tev brane thus suppressed by the tev scale only . </S>",
    "<S> one solution is to localize fermions very close to the planck brane where the effective cut - off is planckian . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out that this suppresses too much the 4d yukawa couplings to the higgs on the tev brane and is incompatible with the spectrum of sm fermion masses . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we impose a bulk ( gauged ) baryon number symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we are also interested in rs guts . </S>",
    "<S> so far , such studies have focused on @xmath6 only @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . we will instead assume @xmath7 or pati  salam , in which the left - right gauge structure mentioned above can easily be embedded . </S>",
    "<S> a priori , grand unification is at odds with imposing baryon number symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , baryon number symmetry can be consistent with higher dimensional gut @xcite if the unified gauge group is broken by boundary conditions ( bc ) so that sm quarks and leptons are obtained from different bulk multiplets of the unified gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a simple example where @xmath7 is broken to the sm on the planck brane by bc and the number of @xmath8 representations is replicated three times per generation : @xmath9 only states in boldface characters have zero modes , they correspond to ( @xmath10 ) bc ( @xmath11 denotes neumann , @xmath12 dirichlet , first sign is for planck brane , second for tev brane ) and are identified with the sm fermions . </S>",
    "<S> other states are ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> gut multiplets are assigned the baryon number of the zero modes contained in them . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath14 symmetry follows from requiring baryon number as a good quantum number : @xmath15 @xmath16 is baryon - number of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is its number of color ( anti - color ) indices . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , sm fields are not charged under @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge bosons of @xmath7 are charged under @xmath14 as well as lepton - like states within @xmath8 s which carry baryon number and quark - like states which carry non standard baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> these exotic states do not have zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the lightest @xmath14 charged particle ( lzp ) can not decay into sm particles and is stable . </S>",
    "<S> note that the baryon number gauge symmetry has to be broken since we do not want an extra massless gauge boson in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we break it spontaneously on the planck brane . </S>",
    "<S> if it is broken in such a way that @xmath25 , we can show that proton decay is planck suppressed @xcite . in order to guarantee this </S>",
    "<S> , we impose the @xmath14 symmetry . as a result , the lzp is stable , and , like in supersymmetry , dark matter can arise as a consequence of solving proton stability .    </S>",
    "<S> the question is now to identify the lzp and see whether one can naturally expect it to be neutral . in warped space , the spectrum of fermionic kk modes </S>",
    "<S> is governed by two things . </S>",
    "<S> first , the _ @xmath26-parameter _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which determines the localization of wave function of massless modes along the 5th direction and therefore the size of their 4d yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> second , it depends crucially on bc reflecting the dynamics taking place at the tev and planck brane . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting thing about ( @xmath13 ) fermionic states is that they are lighter than gauge kk modes for @xmath27 and actually much lighter for @xmath28 . in the past </S>",
    "<S> , studies have focused on ( @xmath10 ) kk fermions , which are always heavier than gauge kk modes , thus are unlikely to be observed at colliders since the constraints on the gauge kk mass is @xmath29 tev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : lkpmass ] shows the dependence on @xmath26 ( exponential for @xmath30 ) of the mass of the first kk excitation of ( @xmath13 ) fermions . very light </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath31 gev ) kk fermions are natural . </S>",
    "<S> this plot is telling us that the lzp will belong to the multiplet whose @xmath26 is the smallest , namely the multiplet with right - handed top zero mode which has @xmath26 in the range @xmath32 $ ] to account for @xmath33 yukawa . </S>",
    "<S> from now on , we will concentrate on that particular @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> = .6    mass splittings between different kk states belonging to the same @xmath8 will arise from radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , and maybe most importantly , we expect splittings in the @xmath26 s due to bulk gut breaking effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such effects ( actually desired to achieve unification through threshold type corrections ) can lead to @xmath34 s as large as @xmath35 therefore making the @xmath26 s of the ( @xmath13 ) states within the same * 16 * almost free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , the lzp has to be the right - handed neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is well known that heavy left - handed neutrino dark matter is excluded by elastic scattering experiments ( unless its mass is larger than several tens of tev ) because of its large coupling to the @xmath36 gauge boson , _ e.g. _  @xcite . from now on , we will therefore assume that the kk rh neutrino has the smallest c , thus is the lzp . in warped @xmath7 or pati  salam , </S>",
    "<S> the kk right - handed neutrino behaves as a wimp as follows . </S>",
    "<S> its couplings to kk gauge bosons like @xmath37 , the extra @xmath38 of @xmath7 , or @xmath24 , are actually enhanced compared to sm couplings , as understood from the cft dual interpretation of kk modes as strongly coupled composites . </S>",
    "<S> however , kk gauge bosons have at least a 3 tev mass , making cross sections effectively of the right weak scale size . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the lzp has actually a non - negligible coupling to @xmath36 because of @xmath37 @xmath36 mixing after ew symmetry breaking as well as lzp @xmath39 mixing from the large yukawa coupling between the @xmath8 of @xmath40 and the @xmath8 of ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such yukawa coupling may also generate a significant lzp - higgs coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to evaluate the relic density of the lzp . </S>",
    "<S> there are essentially four types of annihilation channels : s - channel exchanges of @xmath36 into any sm fermions , of @xmath37 into @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath36 @xmath45 , of higgs into @xmath42 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 and t - channel exchange of @xmath24 into @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note that only fields localized near the tev brane ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath45 , longitudinal @xmath50 and @xmath36 ) have large couplings to @xmath37 and that the only zero mode the lzp directly couples to is @xmath40 . in a first approximation , we have not included the higgs exchange in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , as explained in @xcite , it becomes significant ( but subdominant ) only for lzp masses between @xmath51 and @xmath52 and also dominates at the resonance , @xmath53 , thus modifies the predictions of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relic ] for these masses . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least 6 parameters entering the relic density calculation : @xmath54 which fixes not only the lzp mass but also the lzp couplings , @xmath55 , the gauge kk mass ( mass of @xmath37 and @xmath24 ) constrained to be @xmath56 3 tev but also favoured to be as low as possible not to reintroduce a hierarchy problem , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and finally @xmath60 , the 4d @xmath7 gauge coupling . due to uv sensitive bulk threshold effects and finite , universal 1loop corrections </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath60 can vary from @xmath61 to @xmath62 @xcite . in order to get a large 4d top yukawa without pushing the 5d theory to strong coupling , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 is actually favored . </S>",
    "<S> our qualitative results do not depend much on the precise nature of the ew symmetry breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> however , detailed quantitative predictions do . as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relic ] shows our prediction for the relic density in the attractive case where the higgs is a pseudo goldstone boson ( pgb ) @xcite which is not exactly localized on the tev brane but has some profile in the bulk . for lzp masses below the top mass , </S>",
    "<S> annihilation is dominated by @xmath36 exchange , then annihilation through @xmath24 exchange takes over until the lzp mass reaches the @xmath37 pole . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that there is a large parameter space and particularly a large range of lzp masses for which we can get the right relic density .    </S>",
    "<S> = .6    our lzp being a dirac particle , with significant coupling to the @xmath36 , we predict large cross sections for its elastic scattering off nuclei ( the calculation is similar to the one in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparatively , scattering via higgs exchange is always negligible . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig [ fig : direct ] , the entire parameter space will be tested at near future direct detection experiments . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we show the @xmath64 tev case , disfavoured as far as fine - tuning of the higgs mass is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> even this extreme case , in which discovery of kk modes at colliders would be hopeless , could easily be probed by direct dm searches .    </S>",
    "<S> = .462    = .4    pair production of our wimp at future accelerators can be observed only for the largest values of the @xmath36lzp coupling , which are already ruled out by dm direct searches . however , there are very promising collider signatures associated with the pair production of the next lightest exotic kk modes , in the same * 16 * as the lzp . </S>",
    "<S> those are also expected to have @xmath65 with masses in the few hundred gev1 tev range . </S>",
    "<S> such kk modes can not decay easily . </S>",
    "<S> details will be presented in @xcite . as an example , we show in fig.[fig : collider ] the decay of @xmath66 , which has to go through a 4-body decay : two lzps , a top and a @xmath67 , leading to quite a unique signature . in a significant part of parameter space , such 4-body decay will be forbidden kinematically and @xmath66 may lead to a ionisation track in the detector , something also easy to search for .    in summary , we showed that solving the problem of baryon - number violation in higher - dimensional warped gut by imposing a discrete @xmath14 symmetry leads to the stability of a light kk fermion , which acts as a viable dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasized the interesting phenomenology associated with kk fermions with ( @xmath13 ) type of boundary conditions in warped geometry , our dm candidate being one of them . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that all fields within a multiplet may not have the same bc , in particular in gut theories where the gauge symmetry is broken by bc . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the kk modes in the gut multiplet whose zero mode is @xmath40 to be light ( @xmath68 tev ) and observable at future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> model building issues , further phenomenological aspects and technical details of these models will be provided elsewhere@xcite . </S>"
