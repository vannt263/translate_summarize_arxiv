    "dynamics of vortices has been the subject of intensive study since the pioneering works of helmholtz , lord kelvin and poincar in the 19th century ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "relatively simple dynamics of a thin vortex filament in an incompressible inviscid fluid and in an infinite three - dimensional domain has attracted a particular interest .",
    "an approach based on the localized induction approximation ( lia ) has been proposed in 1906 by da rios @xcite . within",
    "such approximation one assumes that the vorticity @xmath0 is confined to a thin vortex core region and the core radius @xmath1 of the vortex tube is much smaller than the radius of curvature @xmath2 at the point and , hence , the induced velocity at this point is dominated by the contribution from the neighboring segment . using the biot - savart formula @xmath3 under the assumption that the circulation @xmath4 of the vortex is a constant , one gets @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes a point on the filament , @xmath7 is the arclenght , @xmath8 is time , @xmath9 is curvature , @xmath10 denotes the binormal vector and @xmath11 is the length of the segment of the filament whose contribution into the induced velocity is taken into account in the integral ( [ bs - law ] ) . assuming that one can neglect the variation of @xmath11 along the filament , rescaling time by the constant @xmath12 and using the expression of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath6 , one obtains @xmath13 thus , within lia approach , one has a simple binormal motion of the filament with the induced velocity proportional to the curvature @xmath9 . using the serret - frenet formulae for the space curves , one can transform ( [ bin - mot ] ) into the system of intrinsic equations for the curvature @xmath9 and torsion @xmath14 which is of the form @xcite @xmath15 these lia and da rios system have been rediscovered sixty years later in @xcite .",
    "the detailed historical account of this story is presented in @xcite .",
    "an important step in the development of the lia approach has been done by hasimoto in 1972 @xcite .",
    "he observed that the system ( [ bin - intrinsic ] ) is equivalent to the focusing nonlinear schroedinger equation ( nls ) @xmath16 via the transformation @xmath17 the nls equation was already widely known in plasma physics . moreover in 1971 zakharov and shabat @xcite discovered that nls equation ( [ nls ] ) is integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method .",
    "hasimoto s result has demonstrated that the whole powerful machinery of the ist method ( solitons , infinite sets of integrals of motion , symmetries etc . )",
    "is applicable to the vortex filament dynamics .",
    "this fact has lead to the explosion of interest to this field and since that time various aspects of the lia in the vortex filament dynamics have been studied by different methods ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "instabilities of vortex filament and formation of singularities were two important problems partially addressed during this period @xcite .",
    "at the same time it was clear that lia is too restrictive since it neglects several important effects like axial flow , stretching , shortening , filament core structure etc .",
    "attempts to go beyond lia have been done in @xcite-@xcite . in particular",
    ", the inclusion of the axial flow into consideration has lead to the following expression for the induced velocity @xmath18 k \\vec{b } + \\alpha_3 \\vec{t } \\times \\vec{a }   + \\alpha_4 \\vec{t } \\times ( k\\vec{b})_s+\\vec{q}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the tangent vector , @xmath20 are some parameters defined by the called matching condition , @xmath21 is a certain vector and @xmath22 denotes the contribution from the nonlocal effects . in situation",
    "when one can neglect @xmath22 and variation of @xmath23 along the filament , the vector @xmath21 can be chosen as @xmath24 .",
    "after a rescaling of time equation ( [ eqn - axial ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the normal vector , @xmath27 is a certain parameter related to the intensity of the axial flow .",
    "after the hasimoto transformation ( [ has - trans ] ) equation ( [ eqn - axial - approx ] ) becomes @xmath28 that is the hirota equation or the linear combination of the nls and first higher nls equation @xcite .",
    "it is again an integrable equation . on the other hand",
    "it describes new effects such as axial flow , local stretching proportional to @xmath29 , binormal velocity depending on torsion @xmath14 , effects which were not caught by lia equation ( [ bin - mot ] ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that axial flow affects essentially stability properties of the filament.the observation that the simple generalizations of equation ( [ bin - mot ] ) or da rios system ( [ bin - intrinsic ] ) may describe important nonlinear effects essential for vortex filament dynamics was one of the main results of @xcite .",
    "another observation made in @xcite based on the paper @xcite is that the study of the quasiclassical ( or dispersionless ) limit of the equation ( [ hirota ] ) clarifies essentially an analysis of destabilizing effects in the vortex filament motion .",
    "the latter result was strongly supported by the recent study of the modulation instability of the focusing nls and higher nls equations ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . in these papers",
    "it was shown that the dispersionless limit of the nls equation ( dnls ) is quite relevant to the study of the modulation instability . in this limit nls",
    "is the elliptic system of quasilinear pdes which exhibits the gradient catastrophe behavior at finite time .",
    "behavior of solutions near to the points of catastrophe and beyond has been studied in details in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was argued in these papers that the gradient catastrophe for dnls is a source of the modulation instability for nls .",
    "the above two facts clearly indicate the importance of the integrable systems modeling certain effects of vortex filament dynamics and of their quasiclassical ( or dispersionless ) limit .    moreover , the results of the papers @xcite , showing that the cutoff @xmath30 is not a constant but strongly depends on curvature and torsion of filament , manifestly show the necessity to go beyond the approximation described by equations ( [ eqn - axial - approx ] ) and ( [ hirota ] ) .",
    "indeed , in general case , the parameters @xmath20 in ( [ eqn - axial ] ) are some functions of @xmath9 , the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath22 are certain superpositions of @xmath19 , @xmath10 , and @xmath26 and then the induced velocity is of the form @xmath32 where a , b , c are some functions .",
    "equation ( [ x - generic - motion ] ) implies certain intrinsic equations for @xmath9 and @xmath14 which , for particular choices of a , b , c , are integrable systems @xcite different from ( [ hirota ] ) .",
    "relevance of these equations for the vortex filament dynamics is definitely of interest .",
    "study of the quasiclassical approximation for the intrinsic equations associated with the motion ( [ x - generic - motion ] ) and their implications for the vortex filament dynamics is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "quasiclassical intrinsic systems describe motions of vortex filament with curvature and torsion slowly varying along the filament and in the motion , i.e. they are systems of equations for @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are slow variables defined as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the da rios system ( [ bin - intrinsic ] ) one has @xmath40 or , in terms of riemann invariants @xmath41 @xmath42 for the intrinsic system associated with equation ( [ hirota ] ) ( see @xcite ) and others the corresponding quasiclassical equations are of the form @xmath43 where the characteristic velocity is an appropriate function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the study of the equation @xmath46\\beta_x\\ ] ] which is the the quasiclassical limit of the intrinsic equations corresponding to the evolution of the filament of the type ( [ x - generic - motion ] ) with @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 being real constants .",
    "first two terms in r.h.s . of ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) represents themselves the quasiclassical limit of equation ( [ hirota ] ) ( see equations ( 3.76),(3.77 ) ) from ( @xcite with @xmath50 ) , while the last term is of different type . thought the corresponding contribution to the velocity @xmath51 ( [ x - generic - motion ] ) is quite complicated ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - x - motion ] ) the equation describing",
    "this flow separately is a very simple one .",
    "it is equivalent to the equation @xmath52 which is the dispersionless toda ( dtoda ) or the boyer - finley equation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dtoda equation is integrable and plays an important role in various physical phenomena ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it is known also that dtoda and dnls equations belong to the same dtoda / dnls hierarchy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the first two terms in r.h.s . of ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) represent `` positive '' members the last ( dtoda ) term is the first `` log - type '' term .",
    "the presence of such dtoda contribution into the induced velocity ( [ x - generic - motion ] ) , even if not completely justified in a model independent way , could be of phenomenological importance since it might describe nonlinear effects different from those captured by equation ( [ hirota ] ) .",
    "ellipticity of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) or , in general , of ( [ riem - inv - gen ] ) suggests to write it , following to @xcite , as the nonlinear beltrami equation @xmath53 so , a solution of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) defines ( see e.g. @xcite ) quasiconformal mapping if @xmath54 in particular , any solution of the ddr system ( [ bin - intrinsic - disp ] ) defines a quasiconformal mapping on the plane @xmath55 .",
    "quasiconformal mappings definitely play an important role in the vortex filament dynamics .    according to the result of papers @xcite-@xcite , equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] )",
    "well approximates the corresponding full equation of motion ( equation at @xmath56 ) until the derivatives @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not large .",
    "analysis of behavior of solutions of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) near the point of gradient catastrophe , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 become unbounded , is the main subject of our study .",
    "some results concerning ddr equation ( equation [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] with @xmath59 ) have been reported briefly in @xcite . here , following the same approach",
    ", we will analyze the full equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) .",
    "we will see that the inclusion of these two terms essentially modify the behavior of vortex filament .",
    "our approach starts with the observation that the hodograph solutions of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) describe critical points @xmath60 of the function @xmath61 which obeys the euler - poisson - darboux equation @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 this fact essentially simplifies the analysis of the singular sector for equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) associated with the gradient catastrophe .    since @xmath64 the points of gradient catastrophe belong to a singular sector @xmath65 in the space of solutions of the system ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) for which @xmath66 .",
    "generic points of @xmath65 are characterized by the condition @xmath67 while for deeper singular subsectors @xmath68 , @xmath69 all the derivatives of @xmath61 vanish up to @xmath70 . for these subsectors",
    "one has @xmath71 constraints on all variables parameterizing @xmath61 . in particular",
    ", generic gradient catastrophe happens in a single point @xmath72 .",
    "vortex filament exhibits a very particular behavior at the point of gradient catastrophe .",
    "while at a regular point ( with bounded @xmath9 , @xmath14,@xmath73 , @xmath74 ) a curve modeling the filament always lies of one side of the rectifying plane ( spanned by the tangent vector @xmath19 and the binormal vector @xmath10 ) , at the point of gradient catastrophe it oscillates fast around the rectifying plane .",
    "in addition , center of the osculating sphere ( and its radius ) blows up to infinity .",
    "moreover , the induced velocity @xmath75 becomes unbounded at the point @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "so , the gradient catastrophe for the system ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) give rises to the fast oscillations which resemble the classical airfoil flutter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical results @xcite show that such oscillations begin to expand along the filament @xcite .",
    "such a behavior of filament clearly indicates on its instability .    analytically at the point of gradient catastrophe one has a catastrophe of certain type . using the double scaling limit technique",
    "we show that at the generic point of gradient catastrophe ( i.e. in the sector @xmath78 ) one has the elliptic umbilic catastrophe in terminology of r. thom @xcite with the principal part given by @xmath79 .",
    "deeper gradient catastrophes are associated with higher singularities .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the sector @xmath80 the corresponding singularity is given by @xmath81 singularity from the v. arnold list @xcite with the principal part of the form @xmath82 .    at the point of gradient catastrophe",
    "the quasiclassical approximation becomes invalid and the system ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) should be substituted by its full dispersive version ( by the intrinsic version of equation ( [ eqn - axial - approx ] ) at @xmath56 ) .",
    "first order corrections can be obtained by the double scaling technique together with an appropriate modification of the function @xmath83 to a functional @xmath84 such that the equation @xmath85 for critical points are substituted by the euler - lagrange equation @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "it is shown that for generic point of gradient catastrophe ( i.e. the sector @xmath78 ) the resulting equation for small corrections is equivalent to the painlev i equation @xmath88 the result of the paper @xcite allows us to conjecture that any generic solution of the da rios system ( [ bin - intrinsic ] ) at the point of gradient catastrophe behaves as @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is described by the tritronque solution of the painlev i equation .",
    "it is shown also that a class of double scaling regularizations of the higher gradient catastrophes associated with sectors @xmath68 is described by the equations @xmath92 the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the relation of hodograph solutions with euler - poisson - darboux equation is discussed . in section 3",
    "it is shown that the hodograph solutions of dtoda / dnls equation describe critical points of a function .",
    "hydrodynamic analogy and quasiconformal mappings for the governing equations are considered in section 4 .",
    "next section is devoted to an analysis of gradient catastrophe .",
    "geometrical implications of gradient catastrophe and flutter of vortex filament are described in section 6 . in section 7",
    "it is shown that in the point of gradient catastrophe one has elliptic umbilic , @xmath81 and other singularities .",
    "double scaling regularization of these catastrophes is analyzed in section 8 .",

    "he noted that it is convenient to rewrite equation ( [ hodo - gen ] ) as @xmath113 denoting @xmath114 , one observes that @xmath115 and equation ( [ hodo - gen - tsarev ] ) assumes the form @xmath116 so , equation ( [ hodo - gen - tsarev ] ) and , hence , the hodograph equation ( [ hodo - gen ] ) takes the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is any function obeying the constraint ( [ hodo - constr - tsarev ] ) . in the form ( [ hodo - new - tsarev ] )",
    "the hodograph equations can be formulated also for multi - component hydrodynamic type systems @xcite .",
    "an observation here is that for the ddr system ( [ bin - intrinsic - disp ] ) and equation ( [ bin - riemann - inv ] ) one has @xmath119 and , hence , @xmath120 furthermore , these equations imply that @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are certain real valued functions . for instance , for equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] )",

    "it remains to note that @xmath130 is a solution of the equation ( [ hodo - epd ] ) with @xmath131 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the usual approach in which hodograph solutions of the commuting quasilinear systems contributing into the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) can be found via different linear second order equations ( see equations ( [ epd - nls]),([epd - toda ] ) , ( [ nonepd - mkdv ] ) ) , in the approach described above all of them can be build via solutions of the same and simple epd equation @xmath62 .",
    "epd equations of different types are well studied and have number of remarkable properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their relevance for the theory of hydrodynamic type equations and whitham equations has been understood in the papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the observations made in the previous section , one readily concludes that the hodograph equation ( [ hodo - fin ] ) can be represented as @xmath132 where @xmath133 and the function @xmath61 obeys the epd @xmath62 equation @xmath134 thus , one has    hodograph solutions of equations ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) describes critical points ( [ crit - eqn ] ) of the function @xmath61 defined in ( [ w ] ) which obeys the epd @xmath62 equation .    in the hyperbolic case , i.e. for the quasiclassical shallow water equation ( or one - layer benney system ) this fact has been observed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so , in order to construct a solution of equation ( [ nls - mkdv - toda - riem - inv ] ) one takes a function @xmath61 of the form ( [ w ] ) with function @xmath129 given by ( [ gen - w ] ) , arbitrary functions @xmath126 solving epd @xmath62 equation and finds its critical points solving equation ( [ crit - eqn ] ) .",

    "the former are small for filaments close to a straight line ( small @xmath9 ) and becomes larger for more curved filaments .",
    "in contrast , the dtoda type contribution to the induced velocity ( proportional to @xmath149 ) is smaller for larger @xmath9 and increase with decreasing @xmath9 . since in the approximation under consideration",
    "always @xmath150 the dtoda type contribution might be relevant for the description of some nonlinear and nonlocal effects appearing for slightly curved vortex filaments .    in virtue of ( [ epd - w ] ) at the critical points of the function @xmath61 given by ( [ crit - eqn ] ) or ( [ crit - eqn - kt ] )",

    "we will be interested in properties of curved vortex filament .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will assume that @xmath154 .",

    "ellipticity of the ddr system ( [ bin - intrinsic - disp ] ) and more general system ( [ kt - sys ] ) means that they have properties drastically different from those of the hyperbolic version of the ddr system ( or the system ( [ suleiman - eqn ] ) with @xmath157 ) , that is the classical shallow water equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the latter has standard riemann wave solutions while in the elliptic case the cauchy problem is ill posed . in spite of such a difference a representation of the elliptic systems in the form of hydrodynamic type systems , but with negative pressure , has been widely used in the analysis of their local properties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "following this line one can rewrite the system ( [ kt - sys ] ) in terms of @xmath158 and @xmath159 as @xmath160 where @xmath161 here @xmath162 , @xmath51 , and @xmath163 play the roles of density , velocity and pressure .",
    "note that the system considered in @xcite is not a system of quasi - linear equations .",
    "it contains the terms nonlinear in first order derivatives in addition to those quasi - linear ones in the system ( [ kt - sys ] ) with @xmath56 .",
    "moreover our definition of the velocity and pressure is slightly different from those from @xcite .",
    "consequently , the system ( [ euler ] ) is composed exactly by the continuity and euler equations in contrast to the system ( 3.79)-(3.80 ) from @xcite .",
    "properties of the system ( [ euler ] ) are fully determined by the properties of the pressure ( [ pressure ] ) . within lia",

    "dominate and the sign of the pressure is different for different values of @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath165 then the pressure p for large @xmath9 and @xmath14 is positive , while in the opposite case it is negative .",
    "then , for the points with small @xmath14 ( near flattening points ) one has stabilizing effect ( @xmath166 ) while , with large torsion @xmath167 dhirota contribution ( i.e. axial flow contribution ) always destabilize the filament ( recall that @xmath168 ) .    for small @xmath9 ( small density )",
    "pure dtoda contribution equal to @xmath169 dominates the pressure .",
    "so , for small @xmath9 the sign of the pressure coincides with the sign of @xmath170 .",
    "hence , once again one has a threshold dividing the regimes with positive and negative pressure and consequently stabilizing and destabilizing effects of contributions different from the original lia model of da rios .",
    "if one considers the contribution only from axial flow ( @xmath171 ) the pressure is @xmath172 @xmath163 vanishes for @xmath9 and @xmath14 connected by the relation @xmath173 , while it is positive for vortex filaments with curvature and torsion obeying the condition @xmath174 and it is negative in the opposite case .",
    "this discussion shows that stability or instability of vortex filaments strongly depends on their geometry ( relations between curvature and torsion ) .",
    "there is another way to formulate and emphasize an ellipticity of governing equations .",
    "the ddr system ( [ bin - riemann - inv ] ) and more generally system ( [ riem - inv - gen ] ) are elliptic systems of quasilinear equations and , hence , under certain conditions their solutions define quasiconformal mappings on the plane ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the behavior of a curve changes drastically . indeed , when @xmath29 and @xmath244 ( i.e. @xmath245 and @xmath246 ) become large , the r.h.s .",
    "of the formula ( [ xxx ] ) contains two parameters : small @xmath7 and large @xmath29 and @xmath244 .",
    "so , the second terms in @xmath247 and @xmath248 become relevant and different balance between @xmath7 and @xmath29 ( @xmath244 ) lead to different regimes in behavior of a curve around the origin .",

    "such oscillation is quite similar to that of airfoil ( see e.g. @xcite ) and one can refer to these oscillations of a filament in the point of gradient catastrophe as a flutter .",
    "another peculiarity of the point of gradient catastrophe can be seen in the behavior of the focal curve associated with filaments .",
    "the focal curve ( see e.g. @xcite ) is formed by the totality of centers of osculating spheres .",
    "osculating sphere has a contact of third order with the curve in a points .",
    "its center has coordinates @xmath250 where @xmath6 is the position vector of a point on the curve .",
    "the radius @xmath2 of the osculating sphere is given by @xmath251 for a set of regular points the corresponding piece of the focal curve is regular too and it lies on a finite distance from the original curve .    at the point of gradient catastrophe @xmath252 and ,",
    "hence , the center of the osculating sphere as well as its radius blow up to infinity in the direction of the binormal vector ( catastrophe direction , see figure [ fig - cat - dir ] ) .",
    "so , the point of gradient catastrophe for the original curve at which both curvature and torsion are finite corresponds to a point of the focal curve at which the second focal curvature ( @xmath253 ) becomes singular .",
    "we emphasize that even if our consideration for the original curve is purely local at the point of gradient catastrophe one observes a nonlocal effect of unbounded increase of the distance between a point on the original curve and the corresponding point on the associated focal curve .",
    "we note that the blow - up of @xmath254 and @xmath2 for the focal curve happens also at the flattening points at which @xmath255 ( for a discussion on the flattening points see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it would be of interest to understand fully a difference between the flattening points on a curve and points with unbounded @xmath29 in pure geometrical terms . as an obvious difference one may observe that at the flattening point the projection of the curve on the osculating plane remains to be a parabola and",
    "the velocity @xmath233 and acceleration @xmath256 remain bounded too .",
    "in order to understand better the phenomenon described above one should analyze in more detail the structure of the singularity and the regularizing mechanism for the gradient catastrophe . for the focusing nls equation",
    "such an analysis based on the @xmath201-expansion of the integrals of motions of the nls / toda equation has been performed in @xcite . here",
    "we will follow a different approach proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a neighborhood of the gradient catastrophe point @xmath72 and denote the values of @xmath44 at this point by @xmath257 . following the double scaling limit method ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) we will look for solutions of the system ( [ kt - sys ] ) near the point of gradient catastrophe in the form @xmath258 where @xmath259 and numbers @xmath260 should be fixed by further consideration . in our approach",

    "such type of behavior will be studied elsewhere .",
    "at the point of gradient catastrophe the quasiclassical approximation ceases to be valid and contribution of the higher order derivatives terms in the governing equation becomes relevant .",
    "a standard way to deal with this problem is to begin with the full ( dispersionfull ) version of the governing equation ( i.e. da rios system ( [ bin - intrinsic ] ) or intrinsic version of equation ( [ hirota ] ) ) and , then , performing an appropriate double scaling limit , calculate the required regularization terms . for the nls equation ( [ nls ] )",
    "such an analysis has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the first step is based on the observation ( section 3 ) that governing equations describe critical points of the function @xmath61 .",
