    "particle physics models including supersymmetry solve a host of problems occurring in non - supersymmetric theories , and predict a variety of new matter states the sparticles at or around the tev scale@xcite . the so - called _ minimal _ supergravity ( msugra ) model ( sometimes also referred to as the cmssm ) has traditionally been the most popular choice for phenomenological susy analyses . in msugra , it is assumed that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is valid from the weak scale all the way up to the gut scale @xmath2 gev , where the gauge couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 unify . in many of the early sugra models@xcite ,",
    "a simple choice of khler metric @xmath5 and gauge kinetic function @xmath6 led to _ universal _",
    "soft susy breaking scalar masses ( @xmath7 ) , gaugino masses ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9-terms ( @xmath10 ) at @xmath11 .",
    "this assumption of universality in the scalar sector leads to the phenomenologically required suppression of flavor violating processes that are supersymmetric in origin . in the msugra model , we thus assume universal scalar masses , gaugino masses ( as a consequence of assuming grand unification ) and @xmath9-terms .",
    "we will also require that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively ( rewsb ) , allowing us to fix the magnitude , but not the sign , of the superpotential higgs mass term @xmath12 so as to obtain the correct value of @xmath13 . finally , we trade the bilinear soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) parameter @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values ) .",
    "thus , the parameter set @xmath16 completely determines the spectrum of supersymmetric matter and physical higgs fields .",
    "in our calculations , we use isajet v7.64 @xcite since this version includes a number of improvements in calculating the susy particle mass spectrum compared to v7.58 used in ref.@xcite .",
    "once the susy and higgs masses and mixings are known , then a host of observables may be calculated , and compared against experimental measurements .",
    "the most important of these include :    * lower limits on sparticle and higgs boson masses from new particle searches at lep2 , * the relic density of neutralinos originating from the big bang , * the branching fraction of the flavor changing decay @xmath17 , * the value of muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath18 and * the lower bound on the rate for the rare decay @xmath19 .",
    "our goal is to delineate the msugra parameter space region consistent with all these constraints . in our analysis , we incorporate a new calculation of the neutralino relic density that has recently become available@xcite .",
    "we also present improved @xmath20 branching fraction predictions in accord with the current isajet release .",
    "we discuss constraints imposed by the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "finally , we delineate the region of msugra parameter space excluded by the cdf lower limit@xcite on the branching fraction of @xmath1 .",
    "this constraint is important for very large @xmath15s@xcite .    within the msugra framework , the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the most important for fixing the scale of sparticle masses .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ( for fixed values of other parameters ) is convenient for a simultaneous display of these constraints , and hence , of parameter regions in accord with all experimental data .",
    "*   constraints from lep2 searches *    based on negative searches for superpartners at lep2 , we require    * @xmath21 gev   and   @xmath22 gev provided @xmath23 gev ,    which is the most stringent of the slepton mass limits .",
    "the lep2 experiments also set a limit on the sm higgs boson mass : @xmath24 gev@xcite . in our msugra parameter space scans , the lightest susy higgs boson @xmath25 is almost always sm - like .",
    "the exception occurs when the value of @xmath26 becomes low at very large values of @xmath15 . for clarity , we show contours where    @xmath27 gev , and will direct the reader s attention to any regions where this bound might fail .",
    "+ * neutralino relic density *    measurements of galactic rotation curves , binding of galactic clusters , and the large scale structure of the universe all point to the need for significant amounts of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe .",
    "in addition , recent measurements of the power structure of the cosmic microwave background , and measurements of distant supernovae , point to a cold dark matter density@xcite    @xmath28 .",
    "the lightest neutralino of msugra is an excellent candidate for relic cdm particles in the universe .",
    "the upper limit above represents a true constraint , while the corresponding lower limit is flexible , since there may be additional sources of cdm such as axions , or states associated with the hidden sector and/or extra dimensions .    to estimate the relic density of neutralinos in the msugra model",
    ", we use the recent calculation in ref . @xcite . in that work ,",
    "all relevant neutralino annihilation and co - annihilation reactions are evaluated at tree level using the comphep@xcite program .",
    "the annihilation cross section times velocity is relativistically thermally averaged@xcite , which is important for obtaining the correct neutralino relic density in the vicinity of annihilations through @xmath29-channel resonances . + * the @xmath20 branching fraction *    the branching fraction @xmath30 has recently been measured by the belle@xcite , cleo@xcite and aleph@xcite collaborations . combining statistical and systematic errors in quadrature ,",
    "these measurements give @xmath31 ( belle ) , @xmath32 ( cleo ) and @xmath33 ( aleph ) .",
    "a weighted averaging of these results yields @xmath34 .",
    "the 95% cl range corresponds to @xmath35 away from the mean . to this",
    "we should add uncertainty in the theoretical evaluation , which within the sm dominantly comes from the scale uncertainty , and is about 10% .",
    "together , these imply the bounds ,    @xmath36 . in our study , we show contours of @xmath30 of 2 , 3 , 4 and @xmath37 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath30 used here is based upon the program of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our calculations",
    ", we also implement the running @xmath38-quark mass including susy threshold corrections as calculated in isajet ; these effects can be important at large values of the parameter @xmath15@xcite .",
    "our value of the sm @xmath20 branching fraction yields @xmath39 , with a scale uncertainty of 10% .",
    "+ * muon anomalous magnetic moment",
    "*    the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath40 has been recently measured to high precision by the e821 experiment@xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "the most challenging parts of the sm calculation are the hadronic light - by - light@xcite and vacuum polarization ( hvp)@xcite contributions and their uncertainties .",
    "presently these results are in dispute . in the case of the hvp",
    "the use of tau decay data can reduce the error , but the interpretation of these data is somewhat controversial@xcite .",
    "thus , the deviation of the measurement from the sm depends on which prediction is taken into account .",
    "according to the recent analysis by hagiwara et al.@xcite :    @xmath42 .",
    "a different assessment of the theoretical uncertainties@xcite using the procedure described in ref.@xcite gives ,    @xmath43 . in view of the theoretical uncertainty , we only present contours of @xmath44 , as calculated using the program developed in @xcite , and",
    "leave it to the reader to decide the extent of the parameter region allowed by the data .",
    "+ * @xmath19 decay *    the branching fraction of @xmath45 to a pair of muons has been experimentally bounded by cdf@xcite :    @xmath46 . a potentially important contribution to this decay",
    "is mediated by the neutral states in the higgs sector of supersymmetric models .",
    "while this branching fraction is very small within the sm ( @xmath47 ) , the amplitude for the higgs - mediated decay of @xmath45 grows as @xmath48 within the susy framework , and hence can completely dominate the sm contribution if @xmath15 is large . in our analysis",
    "we use the results from the last paper in ref.@xcite to delineate the region of msugra parameters excluded by the cdf upper limit on its branching fraction .",
    "to generate numerical results , in this work we use isajet v7.64 that includes several improvements over v7.58 which was used in ref.@xcite .",
    "these changes lead to important differences in the figures when compared with ref.@xcite .",
    "notably , the boundary of the region excluded by the lack of rewsb moved to higher @xmath49 values and the allowed relic density region along this boundary changed , especially for the lower @xmath15 values .",
    "furthermore , for high @xmath15 and @xmath50 the diagonal corridors allowed by the relic density are considerably shifted and narrowed . finally , the area allowed by relic density near the boundary of the stau lsp region shrank at low @xmath15 s .",
    "our first results are plotted in fig.[fig : sug10 ] . here , we show the @xmath51 plane for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and both signs of @xmath12 .",
    "the red shaded regions are excluded either due to a lack of rewsb ( right - hand side ) , or a stau lsp ( left - hand side ) . the magenta region is excluded by searches for charginos and sleptons at lep2 .",
    "the region below the red contour is excluded by lep2 higgs searches , since here @xmath54 gev .",
    "in addition , we show regions of neutralino relic density with green contours marking @xmath55 ( dotted ) , 0.3 ( dashed ) and 1.0 ( solid ) .",
    "the region right to the solid green contour has @xmath56 , and would thus be excluded since the age of the universe would be less than 10 billion years .",
    "there is no constraint arising from @xmath1 decay at @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath57 the magenta contours denote values of @xmath58 and @xmath37 and the blue contours denote values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , moving from lower left to upper right .",
    "an intriguing feature of the plot is that the region with the allowed relic density in the lower left part , where neutralinos mainly annihilate via @xmath61-channel slepton exchange to lepton - anti - lepton pairs is essentially excluded by the @xmath62 , @xmath20 and @xmath44 constraints .",
    "that leaves two allowed regions with a preferred relic density : one that runs near the stau lsp region , where @xmath63 co - annihilation effects reduce an otherwise large relic density ( as pointed out by ellis _",
    "et al._@xcite ) .",
    "this region has a highly fine - tuned relic density , since a slight change in @xmath7 leads to either too light or too heavy of a @xmath64 mass to give @xmath65@xcite .",
    "the other runs parallel to the rewsb excluded region for @xmath66 gev in the `` focus point '' susy region .",
    "it occurs when the @xmath67 has a sufficiently large higgsino component that annihilation into @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 pairs reduces the relic density@xcite . for @xmath71",
    "almost the entire plane shown is in accord with the measured branching fraction of @xmath20 .",
    "the blue contours denote values of @xmath72 , 40 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 2 and @xmath73 .",
    "constraints from @xmath74 as well as from @xmath75 are not relevant for this case . in this case",
    "the slepton annihilation region of relic density has a small surviving region just beyond the higgs mass contour .",
    "for the most part , to attain a preferred value of neutralino relic density , one must again live in the stau co - annihilation region .",
    "a final possibility is to be in the slepton annihilation region , but then the value of @xmath62 should be slightly beyond the lep2 limit ; in this case , a higgs boson signal may be detected in run 2 of the fermilab tevatron@xcite .",
    "we next turn to our results for @xmath76 shown in fig.[fig : sug30 ] .",
    "the gray region in the bottom left corner of the plot is excluded because @xmath77 . in this case , the allowed region of the relic density in the lower - left has expanded considerably owing to enhanced neutralino annihilation to @xmath78 and @xmath79 at large @xmath15",
    ". both lighter values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 and also large @xmath82 and @xmath38 yukawa couplings at large @xmath15 enhance these @xmath61-channel annihilation rates through virtual staus and sbottoms .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath50 the region excluded by @xmath30 and by @xmath44 also expands , and most of the cosmologically preferred region is again ruled out .",
    "as before , we are left with the corridors of stau co - annihilation and an enlarged focus point scenario@xcite as the only surviving regions .",
    "for @xmath71 the magenta contours of @xmath30 correspond to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the lower left region is excluded since it leads to too _ low _ a value of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath85 contours begin from lower left with @xmath86 , then proceed to 40 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 2 and @xmath73 .",
    "a fraction of the slepton annihilation region of relic density is excluded also by too large a value of @xmath44 .",
    "of course , a reasonable relic density may also be achieved in the stau co - annihilation and focus point regions of parameter space .",
    "next , we turn to fig.[fig : sug4552 ] where we examine the msugra parameter plane for very large values of @xmath87 and @xmath57 .",
    "the gray and red regions are as in previous figures .",
    "the blue region is excluded because @xmath88 , denoting again a lack of appropriate rewsb .",
    "the inner and outer red dashed lines are contours of @xmath89 and @xmath90  gev , respectively .",
    "the former is roughly the lower bound on @xmath26 from lep experiments . in between these contours",
    ", @xmath25 is not quite sm - like , and the mass bound from lep may be somewhat lower than @xmath91  gev shown by the solid red contour , but outside the 200  gev contour this bound should be valid .",
    "much of the lower - left region is excluded by too high a value of @xmath92 and too low a value of @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , in this plane , the experimental limit on @xmath19 enters the lower - left , where values exceeding @xmath93 are obtained .",
    "it seems that in the upper region which is favored by the @xmath94 constraint , detection of @xmath75 at the tevatron will be quite challenging .    in this figure ,",
    "the relic density regions are qualitatively different from the lower @xmath15 plots .",
    "a long diagonal strip running from lower - left to upper - right occurs because in this region , neutralinos annihilate very efficiently through @xmath29-channel @xmath9 and @xmath95 higgs graphs , where the total higgs widths are very large due to the large @xmath38 and @xmath82 yukawa couplings for the high value of @xmath15 in this plot .",
    "adjacent to this region allowed regions where neutralino annihilation is still dominated by the @xmath29-channel higgs graphs , but in this case the annihilation is somewhat off - resonance .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath95 widths are so large that even if @xmath96 is relatively large , efficient annihilation can still take place .",
    "( an improvement of the higgs widths is adopted for these plots compared to ref.@xcite . )    for the case of @xmath71 , we show the msugra parameter space plane for @xmath97 . in this plane",
    ", the relic density annihilation corridor occurs near the boundary of the excluded @xmath64 lsp region .",
    "the width of the @xmath9 and @xmath95 higgs scalars is very wide , so efficient @xmath29-channel annihilation through the higgs poles can occur throughout much of the allowed parameter space .",
    "but the annihilation is not overly efficient due to the large breadth of the higgs resonances . in much of the region with @xmath98 gev",
    ", the value of @xmath30 is below @xmath99 , so that some of the lower allowed relic density region where annihilation occurs through @xmath61-channel stau exchange is excluded .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath44 is in the range of @xmath100 , which is in accord with the e821 measurement .",
    "the value of @xmath62 is almost always above 114.1 gev , and the @xmath101 is always below @xmath102 , and could ( if at all ) be detected with several years of main injector operation . in conclusion , we have presented updated constraints on the msugra model from _ i. _ ) the lep2 constraints on sparticle and higgs boson masses , _ ii .",

    "we find favored regions of parameter space which may be categorized by the mechanism for annihilating relic neutralinos in the early universe :    * 1 . * annihilation through @xmath61-channel slepton exchange ( low @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ,    * 2 . * the stau co - annihilation region ( very low @xmath7 but large @xmath8 ) ,    * 3 .",
