    "many successes of modern solid - state physics and chemistry are related with the development of the hohenberg - kohn - sham density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite which is designed for the ground state and based on the minimization of the total energy @xmath5 $ ] with respect to the electron density @xmath6 . for practical applications , dft resorts to iterative solution of single - particle kohn - sham ( ks ) equations , @xmath7 together with the equation for the electron density : @xmath8 defined in terms of eigenfunctions ( @xmath9 ) , eigenvalues ( @xmath10 ) , and the occupation numbers ( @xmath11 ) of ks quasiparticles .",
    "different terms in eq.([eqn : ks ] ) are correspondingly the kinetic - energy operator , the hartree potential , the exchange - correlation potential , and the external potential . in the following",
    "we will also reserve the notation @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath15@xmath17@xmath15@xmath18 for the total ks hamiltonian in the real ( @xmath19 ) space .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential is typically treated in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "it employs an analytical expression for @xmath20 $ ] borrowed from the theory of homogeneous electron gas in which the density of the electron gas is replaced by the local density of the real system .",
    "lda is far from being perfect and there are many examples of so - called strongly - correlated materials for which the conventional lda appears to be insufficient both for the excited - state and ground - state properties.@xcite    a typical situation realized in transition - metal ( tm ) oxides is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dossummary ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize two points .",
    "+ ( i ) the common feature of many tm oxides is the existence of the well isolated narrow band ( or the group of bands ) located near the fermi level and well isolated from the rest of electronic stares . for compounds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dossummary ] , this is the tm @xmath3 band , which is sandwiched between o(@xmath21 ) band ( from below ) and a group of bands ( from above ) , which have an appreciable weight of the tm @xmath22 states ( the meaning of many notations will become clear in sec .  [",
    "sec : kineticapplications ] , where we will discuss details of the crystal and electronic structure for the considered oxide compounds ) .",
    "electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds are predetermined mainly by the behavior of this @xmath3 band .",
    "the effect of other bands can be included indirectly , through the renormalization of interaction parameters in the @xmath3 band .",
    "+ ( ii ) the lda description appears to be especially bad for the @xmath3 states located near the fermi level .",
    "it often fails to reproduce the insulating behavior of these compounds , as well as the correct magnetic ground state , which is directly related with the existence of the band gap.@xcite the source of the problem is know to be the on - site coulomb correlations , whose form is greatly oversimplified in the model of homogeneous electron gas .",
    "therefore , the basic strategy which was intensively pursued already for more than decade was to incorporate the physics of on - site coulomb correlations in lda and to solve this problem using modern many - body techniques .",
    "this way of thinking gave rise to such directions as lda@xmath15@xmath23 ( e.g. , refs .",
    ", , and ) and lda@xmath15dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory , ref .  ) .    taking into account two above arguments , we believe that the most logical way to approach the problem of coulomb correlations in narrow - band compounds is to divide it in two part : + ( i ) mapping of conventional electronic structure calculations onto the multi - orbital hubbard model , and derivation of the parameters of this model from the first principles , for example starting from the simplest electronic structure in lda ; + ( ii ) solution of this multi - orbital hubbard model using modern many - body methods.@xcite    in this paper we will discuss the first part of this project and show how results of conventional lda calculations for the @xmath3 bands can be mapped onto the multi - orbital hubbard model : @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the wannier orbital @xmath27 of the site @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a joint index , incorporating all remaining ( spin and orbital ) degrees of freedom . the matrix @xmath30 parameterizes the kinetic energy of electrons .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath31 have the following meaning : the site - diagonal part ( @xmath28@xmath13@xmath32 ) describes the local level - splitting , caused by the crystal field and ( or ) the spin - orbit interaction , while the off - diagonal part ( @xmath28@xmath33@xmath32 ) stands for the transfer integrals ( or the transfer interactions ) .",
    "@xmath34@xmath13@xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 are the matrix elements of _ screened _ coulomb interaction @xmath38@xmath36@xmath39 , which are supposed to be diagonal with respect to the site indices . in principle , the off - diagonal elements can be also included into the model .",
    "however , we do not consider them in the present work . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we will discuss several open questions related with the definition of the intersite coulomb interactions in lda .    the first part of this paper will be devoted to derivation of the parameters of the kinetic energy .",
    "then , we will explain how to construct the wannier functions ( wfs ) , which generate these parameters after applying to the ks hamiltonian in the real space .",
    "the next part will be devoted to calculations of screened coulomb interactions , using the wf formalism .",
    "in this section we will briefly review the main ideas of linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method , as they will be widely used in the subsequent sections for the construction of transfer interactions and the wannier orbitals .",
    "the method is designed for the solution of ks equations in lda . for the details and recent developments ,",
    "the reader is referred to the activity of the o.  k.  andersen group at the max - plank institute in stuttgart.@xcite    majority of modern electronic structure methods use some basis .",
    "the basis functions of the lmto method , @xmath40 ( the so - called muffin - tin orbitals  mtos ) have many similarities with orthogonalized atomic orbitals .",
    "as we will see below , the lmto method is very convenient for constructing the wfs , and for certain applications , the basis function of the lmto method , from the very beginning , can be chosen as a wannier function .",
    "the conventional lmto approach employs the atomic - spheres - approximation ( asa ) , which assumes that the whole space of the crystal can be filled by overlapping atomic spheres ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mto ] ) , so that the overlap between the spheres as well as the empty spaces , which are not encircled by any spheres , can be neglected .",
    "the mtos are constructed from solutions of ks equations inside atomic spheres ( the partial waves ) , calculated at some energies @xmath41 ( typically , the center of gravity of the occupied band or of the entire band ) , @xmath42 , and their energy derivatives @xmath43 . in each atomic sphere , the ks potential is spherically averaged . therefore , the solutions are proportional to the angular harmonics , which are specified by the indices @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 ( correspondingly , orbital and azimuthal quantum numbers ) . at the atomic sphere boundaries ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 match continuously and differenciably onto certain envelop functions .",
    "the latter are typically constructed from irregular solutions of laplace equation , which rapidly decay in the real space ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mto ] ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 obey the following `` lmto algebra '' : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath12@xmath13@xmath54 is the kohn - sham hamiltonian in the real space",
    ". then , one possible choice of the muffin - tin orbitals is @xmath55 in this paper we use the shorthanded notations by andersen _",
    "et al._. for instance , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lmtobasis1 ] ) should be read as follows : @xmath56 the first and second terms in the right - hand side of this equation are sometimes called , correspondingly , the `` head '' and the `` tail '' of mto .",
    "the angular character of mto at the central site @xmath28 is specified by that of partial wave @xmath57 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath12 in the mtos basis ( [ eqn : lmtobasis1 ] ) can be immediately derived by using the properties ( [ eqn : lmtoalgebra1])-([eqn : lmtoalgebra5 ] ) of @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the diagonal matrices constructed from @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the shorthanded notation for the matrix @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding overlap matrix , @xmath66 , is @xmath67 since the second term in the right - hand side of @xmath68 is typically small , the basis functions ( [ eqn : lmtobasis1 ] ) are said to form a nearly orthogonal representation of the lmto method , and @xmath69 is the lmto hamiltonian in the second order of @xmath70@xmath36@xmath71 .",
    "the basis ( [ eqn : lmtobasis1 ] ) can be orthonormalized numerically , by applying the transformation @xmath72 the corresponding lmto hamiltonian , @xmath73@xmath13@xmath74 , which is formally valid in all orders of @xmath70@xmath36@xmath71 , is given by @xmath75 this hamiltonian will be used as the starting point in the next section , for the definition of transfer interactions between certain wannier orbitals .",
    "we start with the formal description of the downfolding method .",
    "the construction of the wannier basis functions , underlying this approach , will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : wannier ] , where we will use again all merits of the lmto method and show that proper wfs can be constructed by retaining the `` heads '' of mtos and attaching to them different `` tails '' .    for periodic crystals ,",
    "it is convenient to work in the reciprocal ( @xmath76 ) space . therefore , if it is not specified otherwise , we assume that the lmto hamiltonian is already constructed in the reciprocal space , after the fourier transformation of mtos : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of sites .    for all considered compounds ,",
    "results of our asa - lmto calculations are in a good agreement the ones obtained using more accurate full - potential methods . in our definition of the crystal - field",
    "splitting we go beyond the conventional asa and take into account nonsphericity of the electron - ion interactions ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : nsphcoulomb ] ) .",
    "parameters of the kinetic energy are obtained using the downfolding method , starting from the electronic structure in lda . in order to describe properly the electronic structure of the tm oxides in the valent part of the spectrum using the lmto method , it is typically required several tens or even hundreds basis functions ( including the ones associated with empty spheres , which are added in order to improve the atomic spheres approximation for loosely packed atomic structures ) .",
    "several examples of such bases will given in secs .",
    "[ sec : tsrvo3]-[sec : tv2o3 ] .    what we want to do next is to describe some part of this electronic structure by certain tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian @xmath79 , which , contrary @xmath73 , is formulated in the basis of a very limited number of orthogonal atomic - like orbitals .",
    "for example , in order to reproduce the @xmath3 bands located near the fermi level , one would like to use only three @xmath3 orbitals centered at each tm site .",
    "these orbitals have a meaning of wannier orbitals , which will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : wannier ] .",
    "we start with the identity by noting that any eigenstate of the lmto hamiltonian @xmath73 can be presented as the sum @xmath80@xmath13@xmath81@xmath15@xmath82 , where @xmath81 is expanded over the lmto basis function of the @xmath3-type , @xmath83 ( here , the character of the basis function is specified by its `` head '' ) , and @xmath82 is expanded over the rest of the basis functions @xmath84 .",
    "then , the matrix equations for lmto eigenstates can be rearranged identically as @xmath85 by eliminating @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : seceq2 ] ) one obtains the effective @xmath87-dependent hamiltonian in the basis of @xmath3-states @xmath88 and the `` overlap '' matrix @xmath89 satisfying the condition @xmath90@xmath13@xmath91 .",
    "then , the required tb hamiltonian , @xmath79 , is obtained after the orthonormalization of the vectors @xmath92@xmath93@xmath94@xmath13@xmath95 and fixing the energy @xmath87 in the center of gravity of the @xmath3 band ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 typically , the downfolding is performed in the reciprocal space , and the parameter @xmath96 may also depend on @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath98 can be fourier transformed back to the real space : @xmath99 the site - diagonal part of @xmath100 shall describe the crystal - field ( cf ) splitting caused by the lattice distortion and associated with the transfer interactions between @xmath101- and @xmath102-orbitals , which are eliminated in the downfolding method , while the off - diagonal elements have a meaning of transfer interactions .",
    "the first application of this approach has been considered in ref .  .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : kineticapplications ] we will illustrate abilities of this method for several types of @xmath3 compounds .",
    "the crystal - field splitting may have another origin , which is related with nonsphericity of the electron - ion interactions.@xcite this contribution will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsphcoulomb ] .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that there is a tb hamiltonian , @xmath79 , formulated in some basis of wannier orbitals @xmath103 .",
    "it allows to generate the electronic structure of isolated @xmath3 bands , which is practically identical to the electronic structure obtained after the diagonalization of the total lmto hamiltonian @xmath73 .    in this section",
    "we will solve an inverse problem and construct the basis @xmath103 , which after applying to the original ks hamiltonian , generates the matrix @xmath79 : @xmath104    in a close analogy with the lmto method , we will first introduce the orbitals @xmath105 , which are related with @xmath106 by the orthonormalization transformation @xmath107 and search @xmath108 in the form : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is constructed entirely from the @xmath3-type solutions of ks equations inside atomic spheres and their energy - derivatives @xmath111 : i.e. both @xmath112 and @xmath113 belong to the tm sites , and ` t ' stands for the @xmath114-@xmath3 partial waves .",
    "each @xmath115 is constructed from the rest of the partial waves @xmath116 .",
    "then , @xmath110 and @xmath115 can be found from the following conditions : + 1 .",
    "we request only the @xmath101-part of @xmath117 to contribute to the matrix elements of the ks hamiltonian , and search it in the form of mto : @xmath118 in this definition , @xmath119 is a function of ( yet unknown ) matrix @xmath120 , which will be found later .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath12 in the basis of these wannier orbitals are given by : @xmath121 2 .",
    "the @xmath102-parts of the wf , @xmath122 , do not contribute to the matrix elements ( [ eqn : hwannierme2 ] ) .",
    "they are introduced only in order to make the wfs ( [ eqn : wf2 ] ) orthogonal to the rest of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we search @xmath123 in the form : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is obtained from the condition @xmath126@xmath13@xmath127 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath128 are found from the orthogonality condition of @xmath117 to @xmath129 eigenstates @xmath130 of the original lmto hamiltonian @xmath73 : @xmath131 this allows to include the @xmath102-components of the wfs in a systematic way .",
    "for example , by taking into consideration the @xmath21-partial waves inside oxygen spheres ( @xmath129@xmath13@xmath132 wavefunctions for cubic perovskites ) , the wfs can be orthogonalized to @xmath129@xmath13@xmath132 o(@xmath21 ) bands , etc . for a given @xmath120 ,",
    "the problem is reduced to the solution of the system of linear equations ( [ eqn : orthogonality ] ) .    since @xmath133 contributes to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : orthogonality ] ) , the coefficients @xmath134 will also depend on @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the total wf is an implicit function of the matrix @xmath120 : @xmath117@xmath45@xmath135 .",
    "the last step is the orthonormalization ( [ eqn : wf1 ] ) , which after substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hwannierme1 ] ) yields the following equation for the matrix @xmath120 : @xmath136 this equation is solved iteratively with respect to @xmath120 .",
    "the choice of the wfs as well as their extension in the real space is not uniquely defined . for",
    "many practical applications one would like to have `` maximally localized '' orbitals,@xcite although in the context of the wfs , the term `` maximally localized '' itself bears certain arbitrariness and is merely a mathematical construction , because depending on the considered physical property one can introduce different criteria of the `` maximal localization '' .",
    "although we do not explicitly employ here any procedure which would pick up the `` most localized '' representation for the wfs , our method well suits this general strategy and the obtained wfs are expected to be well localized around the central tm sites .",
    "there are several ways of controlling the spacial extension of the wfs in the lmto method .",
    "+ 1 . by using different envelop functions one can , in principle ,",
    "change the spacial extension of mtos ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mto ] ) , which controls the decay of the original lmto hamiltonian in the real space .",
    "for example , instead of irregular solutions of laplace equation , one can use hankel functions of the complex argument .",
    "however , any choice should satisfy certain criteria of the completeness of the basis set . from this point of view ,",
    "the use of the hankel functions is not well justified as it typically deteriorates the accuracy of lmto calculations .",
    "therefore , in the present work we leave this problem as it is and fix the lmto basis set .",
    "once the lmto basis is fixed , the relative weight of the tm @xmath4-states and other atomic states which contribute to the @xmath3 band can not be changed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.dossummary ] ) .",
    "for example , the contribution of the oxygen @xmath21-states can not be replaced by muffin - tin orbitals centered at the tm sites and vise versa .",
    "the same proportion of atomic orbitals should be preserved in the wfs , constructed for this @xmath3 band .",
    "then , the only parameter which can be controlled is how many wfs , centered at different sites of the lattice , contribute to the density of @xmath4-states at the given tm site .",
    "then , the definition `` localized orbital '' mean that it is mainly centered around given tm site .",
    "conversely , the `` delocalized orbital '' may have a long tail spreading over other tm sites .",
    "then , it is easy to see that our procedure corresponds to the former choice .",
    "indeed , in the first order of @xmath137@xmath36@xmath138 and neglecting for a while the nonorthogonality to the rest of the electronic states , the norm of the wf can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wft ] ) as @xmath139@xmath13@xmath140 , meaning that the wf is fully localized at the central tm site .",
    "then , it holds @xmath120@xmath13@xmath79 , which is valid in the second order of @xmath137@xmath36@xmath138.@xcite therefore , the leading correction to the above approximation , which define the actual weight of the wf at the neighboring tm sites is controlled by the parameters of the kinetic energy @xmath79 , and is of the order of @xmath141 . as we will see below ,",
    "the latter is small .",
    "the conclusion is rather generic and well anticipated for the strongly - correlated systems for which the kinetic - energy terms is generally small .",
    "the angular character of the wf at the central tm site should be consistent with the one extracted from the local density of states in the region of @xmath3 bands ( in the other words , the local density of states at the tm sites should be well represented by atomic orbitals @xmath83 used in the downfolding method ) .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath83 as the set of atomic orbitals which mainly contribute to the local density of states in the region of @xmath3 bands .",
    "for these purposes , at each tm site we calculate the density matrix in the basis of five @xmath4 orbitals @xmath142 : @xmath143 and sum up the contributions of all @xmath3 bands ( here , @xmath144 is an joint index , which incorporates the band index and the coordinates of the @xmath76-point in the first brillouin zone ) .",
    "then , we diagonalize @xmath145 , and assign three most populated orbitals , obtained after the diagonalization to @xmath83 .",
    "the contribution of coulomb interactions to the crystal - field splitting is a tricky issue . despite an apparent simplicity of the problem , one should clearly distinguish different contribution and not to include them twice , in the kinetic and coulomb parts of the model hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) .",
    "the use of full - potential techniques does not automatically guarantee the right answer .",
    "however , the atomic - spheres - approximation , which typically supplements the lmto method , will also require additional corrections for the crystal - field splitting . in this section",
    "we would like to make two comments on this problem .",
    "the nonsphericity of _ on - site _ coulomb interactions is already included in the second part of the model hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) .",
    "the problem will be discussed in details in sec .",
    "[ sec : screenedu ] .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid the double counting , the corresponding contribution to the kinetic - energy part should be subtracted . from this point of view the use of the spherically averaged ks potential in asa",
    "is well justified .",
    "the same is true for the intersite coulomb interactions , if they are explicitly included to the model hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) .",
    "all remaining interactions should generally contribute to the crystal - field splitting .",
    "in asa , the proper correction at the site @xmath28 can be found by considering the matrix elements of the coulomb potential produced by all other atomic spheres ( or ions ) at the site @xmath28 , @xmath146@xmath45@xmath147 is the wf centered at the site @xmath28 , and @xmath148 is the total charge associated with the sphere @xmath32 : namely , the nuclear charge minus the electronic charge encircled by the atomic sphere . the nonspherical part of this integral can be easily calculated in the real space by using the multipole expansion for @xmath149 .    in all forthcoming discussions , unless it is specified otherwise , the matrix elements of the crystal - field splitting will incorporate the correction @xmath150 associated with nonsphericity of the electron - ion interactions .",

    "[ sec : tytio3 ] we already pointed out that the degree of hybridization between atomic tm(@xmath3 ) and o(@xmath21 ) states can differ substantially for different tm oxides .",
    "a typical example is two isoelectronic perovskites : srvo@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 .",
    "the tm(@xmath3)-o(@xmath21 ) hybridization is stronger in srvo@xmath0 , because of two reasons : + ( i ) a direct proximity of o(@xmath21 ) and v(@xmath3 ) bands in srvo@xmath0 , which is expected for tetra - valent compounds ; + ( ii ) a strong orthorhombic distortion observed in ytio@xmath0 , which generally deteriorates the ti(@xmath3)-o(@xmath21 ) hybridization .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect a very different screening of on - site coulomb interactions in these two compounds .",
    "this idea is nicely supported by results of rpa calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.wdistortion ] .",
    "the static @xmath23 is larger ytio@xmath0 .",
    "for example , the diagonal matrix element of @xmath171 is about 3.4 ev , against 2.5 ev in srvo@xmath0 .",
    "this is despite the fact that c - lda has an opposite tendency .",
    "generally , the value of @xmath180 in c - lda is expected to be larger for srvo@xmath0 rather than for ytio@xmath0 , due to different shape of the atomic @xmath114-wavefunctions in the three- and tetra - valent compounds.@xcite so , c - lda yields @xmath180@xmath13 8.9 and 10.1 ev , correspondingly for ytio@xmath0 and srvo@xmath0 .",
    "these parameters have been used as the starting point in rpa , which results in an opposite trend for the static @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the rpa screening is more efficient in srvo@xmath0 , which is consistent with stronger tm(@xmath3)-o(@xmath21 ) hybridization in this compound .",
    "on the other hand , the frequency - dependence of @xmath171 is weaker in ytio@xmath0 , as it immediately follows from the kramers - kronig transformation ( [ eqn : kramerskronig ] ) .    finally , because of different hybridization of the @xmath3 orbitals in ytio@xmath0 , the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath171 are also different ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.wdistortion ] ) . in this case",
    ", there is some deviation from the kanamori rules .",
    "the difference is small ( about 0.07 ev for diagonal matrix elements of @xmath171 at @xmath87@xmath13@xmath127 ) .",
    "however , it may play some role in more delicate applications , such as the orbital magnetism in solids , for example.@xcite      in sec .",
    "[ sec : tv2o3 ] we introduced two possible models for the kinetic - energy part of v@xmath1o@xmath0 : the `` five - orbital model '' treats all v(@xmath114 ) bands on an equal footing , while the `` three - orbital model '' is limited by twelve v(@xmath3 ) bands , close to the fermi level .",
    "we argued that parameters of the kinetic energy can be different for these two models .",
    "the same is true for the effective coulomb interactions .",
    "the rpa provides a very transparent explanation for this difference , which is based on the following arguments . recall that rpa incorporates the screening of on - site coulomb interactions caused by relaxation of the wavefunctions",
    "this relaxation is treated analytically , using regular perturbation theory for the wavefunctions , which results in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polarizationpt ] ) for the polarization function.@xcite    since the v(@xmath22 ) band is eliminated in the three - orbital model , the effective @xmath171 should include the screening caused by that change of the wavefunctions , which is formulated in terms of transitions between v(@xmath3 ) and v(@xmath22 ) bands in the perturbation - theory expansion .",
    "in the five - orbital model , the v(@xmath22 ) band is included explicitly .",
    "therefore , the relaxation caused by possible interactions between v(@xmath3 ) and v(@xmath22 ) bands will be automatically taken into account in the process of solution of the five - orbital model , and we should get rid of this parasitic screening at the stage the construction of the model hamiltonian . thus , the tree - orbital model will include an additional screening of on - site interactions , caused by the v(@xmath3)@xmath93v(@xmath22 ) transitions in the polarization function , which does not appear in the five - orbital model .",
    "this screening appears to be rather efficient ( unlike in cubic perovskites considered in sec  [ sec : rparesultssrvo3 ] ) .",
    "so , the diagonal matrix element of static @xmath3 interactions is about 3.2 and 3.9 ev , for the three- and five - orbital model , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig.wv2o3 ] ) . on the other hand , according to the kramers - kronig transformation ( [ eqn : kramerskronig ] ) , the frequency - dependence of the effective interaction is more important in the three - orbital model .",
    "because of different hybridization of @xmath3 and @xmath181 states in the five - orbital model , the @xmath181 interactions are screened more efficiently ( the static interaction between @xmath181 orbitals is about 3.7 ev ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work was to make a bridge between first - principle electronic structure calculations and the universe of hubbard parameters for strongly - correlated systems .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the problem , by starting with the brief description of the asa - lmto method for electronic structure calculations and ending up with realistic parameters of the kinetic - energy and the coulomb interactions for the series of tm oxides obtained on the basis of this lmto method .",
    "a particular attention has been paid to the analysis of microscopic processes responsible for the screening of on - site coulomb interactions in oxide compounds .",
    "our strategy consists of three steps : + ( i ) derivation of the kinetic - energy part of the hubbard model from the single - particle electronic structure in lda , using the downfolding method .",
    "we have also considered corrections to the crystal - field splitting caused by nonsphericity of electron - ion interactions , beyond the conventional atomic - spheres - approximation .",
    "+ ( ii ) construction of the wannier functions using results of the downfolding method . at this stage",
    "we closely follow the idea of lmto method , and construct the wfs as the lmto basis functions , which after applying to the kohn - sham hamiltonian in the real space generate the matrix elements of the kinetic energy obtained in the downfolding method .",
    "+ ( iii ) calculation of screened coulomb interactions using the concept of _ auxiliary _ wfs .",
    "the latter are defined as the wannier orbitals for which the kinetic - energy part is set to be zero .",
    "this construction allows to avoid the double counting of the kinetic - energy term , which is included explicitly in the hubbard model .",
    "the screened coulomb interactions are calculated on the basis of a hybrid approach , combining the conventional constraint - lda with the random - phase approximation for treating the hybridization effects between atomic tm(@xmath114 ) and o(@xmath21 ) orbitals .",
    "the latter play a very important role and yields a strong renormalization of the effective coulomb interaction for isolated @xmath3 band",
    ". it also explains a strong material - dependence of this interaction , which is sensitive to the crystal environment in solids , the number of @xmath3 electrons , the valent state of the tm ions , etc .",
    "taking into account a wide interest to the construction of effective lattice fermion models from the first principles , we would like to make a brief comparison with other works on a similar subject .",
    "majority of methods start with the construction of the wfs , which are then used as the basis for calculations of the parameters of the kinetic energy and the coulomb interactions .",
    "this is different from our approach , where we start with the kinetic - energy part , and only after that construct the wfs _ for a given set of parameters of the kinetic energy_. we believe that such an order is extremely important , as it allows us to control the contributions of the kinetic energy to the wfs and the coulomb interactions .    among recent works ,",
    "a considerable attention is paid to the method of marzari and vanderbilt , because it allows to control the spacial extension of the wfs .",
    "very recently , schnell  _ et  al .",
    "_ applied this method to calculations of the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian for the series of @xmath114 transition metals.@xcite in each @xmath76-point of the brillouin zone , they constructed the wfs from all 16 bands of the lda hamiltonian , corresponding to the @xmath182 lmto basis . therefore , the total number of wannier orbitals was also 16 .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion has been chosen so to minimize the square of the position operator , @xmath183@xmath13@xmath184 .",
    "the obtained wfs were indeed well localized , and the parameter @xmath23 estimated for the @xmath114 bands was very close to the atomic value ( about 25 ev ) .",
    "however , the corresponding wannier basis set is too large , that does not make a big difference from the original lmto basis set , for which one can also introduce a localized ( tight - binding ) representation.@xcite from the view point of numerical solution of the hubbard model using modern many - body techniques , it is still hardly feasible to work in the basis of 16 wannier orbitals per one tm site , while the simplest hartree - fock approximation is definitely not sufficient for the transition metals.@xcite it would be interesting to see how this method will work for the tm oxides , considered in the present work , where the physical basis set is limited by three wannier orbitals per one tm site .",
    "for example , is it possible to construct the localized wannier orbitals for _ isolated @xmath3 bands _ in the tm oxides , which would be as good as the wannier orbitals derived for _ all bands _ ?",
    "the problem is that when the number of bands decreases , the number of variational parameters for the optimization of the wannier orbitals will also decreases .",
    "therefore , the wannier orbitals will generally become less localized , as it was demonstrated in our work for v@xmath1o@xmath0 .",
    "also , when the problem is formulated in a reduced hilbert space of bands closest to the fermi level , it is very important to consider the screening of coulomb interactions by other bands , which comes from relaxation of the wavefunctions .",
    "these effects are beyond the scopes of the work of schnell  _ et  al .",
    "_ , who only considered the bare coulomb interactions .    in order to construct the wfs ,",
    "ku  _ et  al . _ employed the projector - operator scheme,@xcite which is basically the initial step of the method of marzari and vanderbilt , prior the optimization.@xcite in this scheme , each wannier orbital is generated by projecting a trial wavefunction , @xmath185 , onto a chosen subset of bands ( in our case , @xmath3 bands ) : @xmath186 since such orbitals are not orthonormal , the procedure is followed by the numerical orthonormalization , similar to the one described in sec .",
    "[ sec : lmto ] .",
    "these wfs have been used as the basis for the construction of the low - energy hamiltonian for the series of cuprates , like la@xmath187ba@xmath1cu@xmath1o@xmath188 , where the wannier basis consisted of a single orbital centered around each cu site .",
    "a weak point of this approach is that it is difficult to assess the spacial extension of the wf , which crucially depends on the trial wavefunction , and can be affected by the orthonormalization . in some sense , the result strongly depends on authors intuition on how they choose the trial wavefunction . for example , the _ bare _ coulomb interaction obtained in ref .   in the basis of",
    "their wfs was only 7.5 ev , which is much smaller than the atomic coulomb integral for the cu(@xmath114 ) orbitals .",
    "this means that the wfs are not well localized .",
    "it is not clear at present , whether this is a result of the bad choice of the trial wavefunction , or there is a more fundamental problem related with the fact that a more compact representation for the wfs simply may not exist in this case .",
    "note , that apart from the berry phase , there is no further parameters available for the optimization of the wfs in the single - orbital case .",
    "the delocalization of the wfs gives rise to appreciable direct exchange interactions operating between different cu sites.@xcite this result , however , rises additional questions .",
    "note , that the kinetic part of the hubbard model and the wfs are evaluated in lda , where the exchange - correlation potential is set to be _",
    "local_. in principle , non - local effects can be already incorporated in lda , through the renormalization of parameters of the kinetic energy and the local interactions.@xcite therefore , it is not clear whether the nonlocal exchange interactions should be regarded as independent parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian or not .",
    "finally , ku  _ et  al .",
    "_ calculated only _ bare _ coulomb interactions .",
    "they did not consider the screening of these interactions caused by relaxation effects , which are extremely important .",
    "anisimov  _ et .",
    "al . _ employed a similar approach for the analysis of spectroscopic properties of tm oxides.@xcite they extracted only the kinetic - energy part of the hubbard hamiltonian , using the wfs constructed in the lmto basis , and treated the coulomb interaction @xmath23 as a parameter .",
    "a completely different strategy has been proposed by andersen  _ et .",
    "_ , on the basis of their order-@xmath78 muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) method , which is an extension of the lmto method.@xcite from the very beginning , they construct the nmto basis functions in certain energy interval as the wfs of the original ks hamiltonian .",
    "pavarini  _ et al .",
    "_ applied this method to the series of @xmath189 perovskites.@xcite at present , it is not clear how the nonuniqueness of the wfs is reflected in the construction of the nmto basis set .",
    "obviously , such a basis set is also not unique , and there is some freedom left for the localization of the wannier orbitals , which does not seem to be well controlled .",
    "generally , our transfer integrals for the @xmath189 perovskites seems to be more localized and our crystal - field splitting is smaller .",
    "for example , had we relaxed the constraint condition for the construction of the `` heads '' of the wfs , based on the diagonalization of the density matrix ( [ eqn : densitymatrix ] ) , our conclusion would have been also different : the crystal - field splitting would increase , but the transfer integrals would become less localized .",
    "pavarini  _ et al .",
    "_ did not calculate the coulomb interactions .",
    "instead , they used @xmath23@xmath190@xmath191 ev as a parameter , with the reference to the photoemission data.@xcite however , the photoemission data are typically interpreted in the cluster model , which treats the o(@xmath21 ) band _",
    "explicitly_. for the isolated @xmath3 band , the effective interaction should include an additional renormalization coming from the relaxation of the o(@xmath21 ) band , which is _ eliminated _ in the @xmath3-model .",
    "therefore , the value of the effective @xmath23 should be smaller .",
    "finally , due to unknown for us reason , there is a substantial difference of the parameters of @xmath3 bandwidth ( @xmath192 ) between our work and ref .  , even for cubic srvo@xmath0 .",
    "the parameters reported by pavarini  _ et al .",
    "_ are generally overestimated by about 30%.@xcite our conclusions about magnetic properties of ytio@xmath0 and latio@xmath0 are also different.@xcite details will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "i thank professor masatoshi imada for valuable suggestions , especially for drawing my attention to the problem of wannier functions , nonsphericity of electron - ion interactions and its effect on the crystal - field splitting,@xcite and the random - phase approximation for calculating the effective interaction parameters in the hubbard model.@xcite",
    "in this appendix we consider the screening of on - site coulomb interactions in rpa for an @xmath193-orbital system .",
    "all orbitals are supposed to be equivalent . for simplicity",
    "we neglect small nonsphericity of bare coulomb interactions .",

    "<S> ( ii ) solution of an inverse problem and construction of wfs for the given kinetic - energy hamiltonian . here </S>",
    "<S> , we closely follow the construction of the basis functions in the liner - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method , and enforce the orthogonality of wfs to other band . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily control the contributions of the kinetic energy to the wfs . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) calculation of screened coulomb interactions in the basis of _ auxiliary _ wfs . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are defined as the wfs for which the kinetic - energy term is set to be zero . meanwhile </S>",
    "<S> , the hybridization between tm @xmath4 and other atomic states is well preserved by the orthogonality condition to other bands . </S>",
    "<S> the use of auxiliary wfs is necessary in order to avoid the double counting of the kinetic - energy term , which is included explicitly in the model hamiltonian . in order to calculate the screened coulomb interactions we employed a hybrid approach . </S>",
    "<S> first , we evaluate the screening caused by the change of occupation numbers and the relaxation of the lmto basis functions , using the conventional constraint - lda approach , where all matrix elements of hybridization connecting the tm @xmath4 orbitals and other orbitals are set to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> then , we switch on the hybridization and evaluate the screening of on - site coulomb interactions associated with the change of this hybridization in the random - phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the second channel of screening appears to be very important , and results in relatively small value of the effective coulomb interaction for isolated @xmath3 bands ( about 2 - 3 ev , depending on the material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss details of this screening and consider its band - filling dependence , frequency dependence , influence of the lattice distortion , proximity of other bands , as well as the effect of dimensionality of the model hamiltonian . </S>"
