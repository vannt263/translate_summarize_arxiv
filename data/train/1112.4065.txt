    "we focus on the study of the quasi - periodically ( q.p . for short ) forced logistic map ( flm for short ) .",
    "the flm is a two parametric map in the cylinder where the dynamics in the periodic component is a rigid rotation and the dynamics in the other component is the logistic map plus a quasi - periodic forcing term .",
    "this map appears in the literature in different contexts , usually related with the destruction of invariant curves . for example , in @xcite it was introduced as an example where snas ( strange non - chaotic attractors ) were created through a collision between stable and unstable invariant curves .",
    "since then , different routes for the destruction of invariant curves have been explored for this map , for instance see @xcite and references therein .",
    "some other recent studies are @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the flm is also related to the truncation of period doubling cascades .",
    "it is well known that the one dimensional logistic map exhibits an infinite cascade of period doubling bifurcations which leads to chaotic behavior .",
    "moreover this infinite cascade extends to a wider class of unimodal maps .",
    "but when some q.p .",
    "forcing is added , the number of period doubling bifurcations of the invariant curves is finite .",
    "this phenomenon of finite period doubling cascade has been observed in different applied and theoretical contexts . in the applied context",
    "it has been observed in a truncation of the navier - stokes flow @xcite or in a periodically driven low order atmosphere model @xcite . in the theoretical context , it has also been reported in different maps which were somehow built to have period doubling cascades @xcite , and more recently in the analysis of the hopf - saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "actually , in @xcite the flm itself is given as a model for the truncation of the period doubling bifurcation cascade .",
    "the study presented here is more concerned with the mechanisms which cause the truncation of the period doubling bifurcation cascades than with the possible existence of snas for this family of maps .",
    "concretely , we show ( numerically ) that the reducibility has the role of confining the period doubling bifurcation in closed regions of the parameter space . in the remainder of this article we focus on the shape of this reducibility regions . in @xcite",
    "we will use the reducibility loss bifurcation to study the self renormalizable properties of the bifurcation diagram and how the feigenbaum - collet - tresser renormalization theory can be extended to understand it . see also @xcite for a united exposition of the present paper with the other three cited before .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ section invariant curves in q.p systems ] we review some concepts and results concerning the continuation of invariant curves for a quasi - periodic forced maps .",
    "we also look at the concrete case when the map is uncoupled .    in section [ chapter forcel logistic map ]",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the flm .",
    "first we review some computations which can be found in the literature .",
    "then , we do a study of the parameter space in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set of the map . for this study different properties of the attracting set",
    "are considered , as the value of the lyapunov exponent and , in the case of having a periodic invariant curve , the period . differently to other works , in our study the reducibility of the invariant curves has been also taken into account .",
    "this reveals interesting information , for example we observe that the parameter values for which the invariant curve doubles its period is contained in regions of the parameter space where the invariant curve is reducible .",
    "the subsequent sections are developed with the aim of understanding the results presented in this section .    in section [ section obstruction to reducibility ]",
    "we consider the images and the preimages of the critical set ( this set is the set where the derivative of the map w.r.t the non - periodic coordinate is equal to zero ) .",
    "we also consider the continuation in the parameter space of the invariant curve which comes from one of the fixed points of the logistic map . doing a study of the preimages of the critical",
    "set we construct forbidden regions in the parameter space for the reducibility of the invariant curve . in other words , we give some constrains on the reducibility of the invariant curve .    in section [ section period doubling and reducibility ] the reducibility loss of the invariant curve is considered as a codimension one bifurcation and then we study its interaction with the period doubling bifurcation .",
    "the study done here is not particular for the flm . in this section",
    "we also give a general model for the reducibility regions enclosing the period doubling bifurcation observed in the parameter space of section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] .    in section [ section summary and conclusions ]",
    "we summarize the results obtained in the previous ones .",
    "we analyze again the bifurcations diagram obtained in section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] taking into account the results obtained in sections [ section obstruction to reducibility ] and [ section period doubling and reducibility ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review some of the key definitions and results on the theory of invariant curves in quasi - periodically forced maps .",

    "when one of the parameters is fixed , the other can be computed through a standard newton method . to do the continuation of the bifurcation curve we can vary slightly the fixed parameter and compute the corresponding value of the curve .",
    "the selection of which parameter is fixed has been done depending on the estimated inclination of the curve in the parameter space .      in figure [ flm parameter space ] we show the results of the computation and we have also plotted two successive magnifications of certain subsets of the parameter space .",
    "these regions have been marked with a dashed line in the picture .",
    "the points in the parameter space have been codified in different colors depending on the dynamics of the attractor , see table [ table coding diagrams ] .    at this point",
    "let us recall the dynamics of the logistic map .",
    "we have that for certain values of @xmath67 the map has a cascade of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "this is , we have that there exist a sequence of values @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , such that for @xmath108 the logistic map has an attracting periodic orbit of period @xmath109 and at the value @xmath110 the attractor doubles its period ( from @xmath109 to @xmath111 ) .",
    "let us recall that the logistic map is unimodal for any value of @xmath67 ( i.e. it has a unique point where the derivative of the map is equal to zero ) . in the period doubling cascade , we also have that the attractor crosses the turning point between one period doubling and the next one . in other words , there exist values @xmath112 for which the attracting @xmath109 periodic orbit of the map is the critical point .    in figure [ flm parameter space ] we can observe that from every parameter value @xmath113 it is born a curve where the attractor has zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "let us denote by @xmath114 each of these curves in the parameter space , which corresponds to the period doubling from period @xmath109 to @xmath111 . in the bifurcation diagram at the top of figure [ flm parameter space",
    "] there are plotted the curves @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in the bottom",
    "left one there are displayed the curves @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and finally in the bottom right one there are the curves @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    in the previous figure",
    "it has also been plotted the reducibility and the non - reducibility regions .",
    "we can also observe that from every parameter @xmath119 a `` cone of non - reducibility '' is born , in the sense that there exist two curves in the parameter space which define a zone where the attracting invariant curve of the map is not reducible .",
    "let us denote by @xmath120 ( and respectively by @xmath121 ) the left ( respectively right ) boundary of the non - reducibility region born at the point @xmath119 .",
    "we can observe how the curves @xmath122 and @xmath123 define an enclosed reducibility region which contains the curve @xmath124 . moreover",
    "these three curves seem to meet in a tangent way at the same point .",
    "recall that in section [ section basic study of flm ] we have illustrated a truncation of the period doubling cascade for a fixed value of the coupling parameter @xmath68 , see figure [ exemples fractalitzacio a periode 1 ] .",
    "the results described above on the parameter space of the map agree with the behavior reported there .",
    "looking at figure [ flm parameter space ] we can observe that each period doubling is confined inside a reducibility region .",
    "moreover , when the period is increased each of these regions get closer to the line @xmath125 . then , if one fixes the value of @xmath68 ( arbitrarily small ) and let @xmath67 grow one should expect a finite number of period doublings .",
    "fixing @xmath68 at a prescribed value @xmath126 corresponds to fixing a line @xmath127 in the parameter space .",
    "if the enclosed regions of reducibility get closer to @xmath125 when the period grows , at some point the regions will be below the line @xmath127 .",
    "on the other hand , the shape of the reducibility regions also explains why we observe a reducibility loss and afterwards a reducibility recovery between one period doubling and the next . at the same time , the bifurcation diagram displays many interesting phenomena which can be studied .",
    "the first phenomenon that can be observed in the bifurcation diagram is the birth of non - reducibility cones around the parameters values @xmath128 .",
    "recall that ( definition [ definition of reducibility loss bifurcation ] ) the reducibility loss of an invariant curve can be seen as a codimension one bifurcation .",
    "this codimension one condition defines a one dimensional curve in the parameter space , which is the boundary between the reducibility and the non - reducibility regions . with the notation introduced above",
    ", these boundaries will correspond to the curves @xmath121 and @xmath120 of the parameter space .    actually , the existence of a cone of non - reducibility around the points @xmath128 is equivalent to prove that two reducibility loss bifurcations curves are born at these points .",
    "this will be proved under suitable conditions in @xcite , but the phenomenon can be explained heuristically as follows .    consider that we have an invariant ( or periodic ) curve @xmath5 of the flm .",
    "using corollary 1 of @xcite we have that @xmath6 is reducible if , and only if , @xmath129 has no zeros . for the flm , we have that the points @xmath130 for which @xmath131 is equal to zero are those in the set @xmath132",
    ". therefore an invariant curve @xmath133 is reducible if , and only if , it does not intersect the set @xmath134 . respectively",
    ", a periodic curve will be reducible if , and only if , none of its periodic components touches this set .    on the other hand , when the system is uncoupled ( @xmath125 ) we have that the invariant ( resp .",
    "periodic ) curves are constant lines equal to the fixed ( resp .",
    "periodic ) points of the uncoupled system . for the logistic map we have that when the parameter @xmath67 crosses the value @xmath135 ( resp .",
    "@xmath119 ) , the fixed points ( resp .",
    "one of the components of the periodic orbit ) crosses the set @xmath134 .",
    "when one adds a small coupling to the system the invariant curve is no longer constant .",
    "then when @xmath67 is increased crossing the value @xmath135 ( resp .",
    "@xmath119 ) the invariant curve ( resp .",
    "periodic orbit ) has to lose its reducibility , when it first touches @xmath134 , and then recover it again , when it is completely below ( or above ) @xmath134 .",
    "these two contacts of the invariant ( or periodic ) curve with the set @xmath134 give place to the cone of non - reducibility when the parameters @xmath136 are close to @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 ) .",
    "each boundary of this cone correspond to a loss of reducibility bifurcation curves , namely @xmath120 and @xmath121 , in the parameter space .",
    "another observable phenomenon in the bifurcation diagram of the figure [ flm parameter space ] is that from every parameter value @xmath139 it is born a curve in the parameter space where the attracting set has zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "each of these curves correspond to a period doubling bifurcation of the attractor .",
    "for diffeomorphisms it is known ( @xcite ) that the period doubling of an invariant torus is a codimension one bifurcation .",
    "recall that the flm is not invertible , therefore this theory is not directly applicable .",
    "nevertheless , in the reducible case , one can apply a normal form procedure around the invariant curve , to obtain a one dimensional system in a neighborhood of the curve .",
    "we will formalize this argument in section [ section period doubling and reducibility ] .",
    "then we can understand the period doubling bifurcation of the invariant curve as a period doubling of the reduced system ( in the classical one dimensional sense ) .",
    "for the uncoupled case ( @xmath125 ) this happens at each parameter value @xmath140 . due to the codimension one character of the bifurcation a period doubling bifurcation curve",

    "this can be explained analyzing the numerical procedure .",
    "recall that the continuation of the bifurcation curve has been done as long as the estimated error was below a prescribed tolerance . on the other hand",
    "the function used for the numerical continuation contains the lyapunov exponent of the invariant curve as one of its components . the method used to estimate",
    "the lyapunov exponent behaves much worse when the reducibility is lost .",
    "note that the lyapunov exponent is obtained integrating numerically @xmath149 . in the @xmath25 case",
    "we have have that , in the reducible case the function is @xmath25 whereas in the non - reducible case the function is not even bounded .",
    "this makes the numerical integration behave much worse when the reducibility is lost . despite of that , we have the following reasons to believe that the invariant curve ( at the parameter of bifurcation ) is actually destroyed due to the reducibility loss .    from the theoretical point of view , when the reducibility is lost the spectral problem associated to the continuation of the invariant curve changes drastically . when one tries to apply the ift to an invariant curve there is a big difference from the reducible case to the non - reducible one ( @xcite ) . given an invariant curve and its skew product consider the transfer operator associated to the curve .",
    "we have that the invariant curve can be continued when @xmath57 does not belongs to the spectrum of the transfer operator . in the reducible case the spectrum corresponds to the circle of radius equal to the exponential of the lyapunov exponent of the curve . in the non - reducible case the spectrum corresponds to the disk of the same radius .",
    "when a period doubling occurs , there is an attracting invariant curve which becomes unstable , in other words its lyapunov exponent crosses zero . in the reducible case , one might expect the spectrum of the transfer operator associated to the invariant curve ( which is a circle ) to cross @xmath57 transversally when the bifurcation happens , the curve becomes unstable but survives .",
    "but in the non - reducible case there is no chance of transversal cross .    from the numerical point of view , one can study the behavior of the invariant curve for the parameter values in the period doubling bifurcation just before losing the reducibility . in figure [ critical curve ]",
    "we have displayed the invariant curve @xmath150 of the flm ( [ flm ] ) for the parameters @xmath151 .",
    "this parameter corresponds to the last point in the invariant curve that we have obtained in the numerical computation . in the figure",
    "we also show the first and second derivatives of the curve .",
    "we can observe that the invariant curve @xmath150 seems to keep continuous and it does not fractalize but what fractalizes is its derivative @xmath142 . back to figure [ flm parameter space ] we can observe that the period doubling bifurcation curve can be parameterized by the parameter @xmath68 . then for each @xmath68 we can consider @xmath152 the parameter for the period doubling bifurcation curve and @xmath153 the invariant curve with zero lyapunov exponent for the corresponding values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in figure [ critical curve ]",
    "we have the supremum of @xmath154 and @xmath155 as a graph of @xmath68 .",
    "the figure indicates that @xmath156 .",
    "moreover , looking at the graph of @xmath155 this limit seems to be uniform when taking the supremum on any subinterval of @xmath157 .",
    "this destruction process is similar to the fractalization process described in @xcite , but the curve which fractalizes here is @xmath142 .",
    "the fact that the end point of the period doubling bifurcation corresponds to the parameter where the invariant curve touches the line @xmath134 was already observed in @xcite .",
    "the computations of the bifurcation curve done in the cited work are based on the rational approximation of the rotation number @xmath8 .",
    "our method is based on the computation of the fourier series of the invariant curve and it has the advantage that it allow us to compute the derivatives of the curves easily .    to finish this section",
    "let us remark that this analysis is far from complete . in this direction , in the forthcoming sections [ section obstruction to reducibility ] and [ section period doubling and reducibility ] we present two studies in order to understand better the bifurcation diagram of the figure [ flm parameter space ] . in section [ section summary and conclusions ]",
    "we summarize the different results and we analyze their implications on the cited bifurcation diagram .",

    "these sets will be the closed graph of a curve or a subset of a graph .",

    "recall that in section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] we have reported how the period doubling bifurcation of the flm were enclosed inside regions of reducibility . in the proposed model ( [ skew trivial inviariant set ] ) for the reducibility regions it is easy to justify this behavior .",
    "differentiating the equation which defines the map we have that the critical region of the map is @xmath412 . following the arguments of section [ section obstruction to reducibility ] we have that a reducible invariant ( or periodic ) curve of ( [ skew trivial inviariant set ] ) can not intersect the critical set .",
    "note that for @xmath409 the set @xmath179 is composed by two closed curves in the cylinder , one in each side of the trivial invariant set .",
    "moreover when @xmath413 tends to @xmath414 we have that the components get closer to the trivial invariant set @xmath158 .",
    "if we assume that the parabola in the parameter space @xmath410 corresponds to a period doubling bifurcation , then we have that when the trivial invariant set becomes unstable then a period two solution must be created in its neighborhood .",
    "but then , when @xmath413 tends to @xmath415 we have that the set @xmath238 gets closer and closer to the trivial invariant set , therefore there is no room for the period doubled curve to be reducible .",
    "this explains why arbitrarily close to the `` period doubling - reducibility loss '' bifurcation parameter @xmath411 one can observe a reducibility loss of the period two invariant curve .    in figure",
    "[ period doubling model parameter space ] there are shown the different bifurcation curves of the map ( [ skew trivial inviariant set ] ) .",
    "the reducibility of the period two invariant curve have been estimated numerically .",
    "let us remark the resemblance of the region of reducibility of the attractor with the same regions of the bifurcation diagram of the flm .",
    "we study the forced logistic map as a toy model for the truncation of the period doubling cascade of invariant curves . in section [ section parameter space and reducibility ]",
    "we have done a numerical analysis of the bifurcation diagram of the flm , which is displayed in figure [ flm parameter space ] .",
    "this computation revealed that each period doubling bifurcation curve in the parameter space is confined inside a region where the attracting invariant curve is reducible .",
    "now we can use studies done in sections [ section obstruction to reducibility ] and [ section period doubling and reducibility ] to review the analysis of the bifurcation diagram of the flm done in section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] .    in section [ section obstruction to reducibility ]",
    "we have done a study of the critical set , their images and their preimages .",
    "we have constructed different constrains in the parameter space for the reducibility of the invariant curve @xmath162 ( which is the continuation of the invariant curve @xmath416 for @xmath417 ) .",
    "we have also illustrated how the combination of all these constrains seems to be the optimal constrain for the reducibility of the invariant curve . in other words , they approximate the boundary of reducibility of the attracting set of the map . using the notation introduced in section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] , we have that these constraints characterize the curve @xmath418 . in the bifurcation diagram of the figure [ flm parameter space ] only the properties of the stable set are reflected , but we have that the constrains are still valid after the period doubling .",
    "actually we conjecture that these constrains give the boundary of existence of the curve @xmath162 when it is unstable .    in section [ section period doubling and reducibility ]",
    "we have studied the interaction between the reducibility loss and the period doubling bifurcation .",
    "for the case of linear skew products we have theorem [ theorem lyapunov exponent and reducibility ] , which says that generically we can expect the period doubling bifurcation curves and the reducibility loss bifurcation curve to be tangent .",
    "the diagram of the figure [ flm parameter space ] has been done in terms of the attracting set of the flm . as the flm is not a linear skew product ,",
    "this theorem is not applicable .",
    "but it can be applied to the linear skew product given by the linearization of the map around the invariant curve . in the same section ,",
    "we have also given a model for the interaction of the period doubling bifurcation and the reducibility loss . with this model",
    "we have seen that , if the period doubling is close to a reducibility loss , then there is an obstruction to the reducibility of the period doubled curve .",
    "this explains why the curves @xmath418 , @xmath115 and @xmath419 meet at the same point ( using again the notation of section [ section parameter space and reducibility ] ) .",
    "moreover , theorem [ theorem lyapunov exponent and reducibility ] gives a good explanation of why they do it in a tangent way .",
    "finally , let us remark that the study done in section [ section period doubling and reducibility ] does not depend on the map considered , therefore it can be extended to the rest of reducibility regions determined by @xmath420 and @xmath421 ( and containing @xmath124 ) .",
    "part of the study done here will be continued in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we will propose an extension of the renormalization the theory for the case of one dimensional quasi - periodic forced maps .",
    "using this theory we will be able to prove that the curves @xmath422 of reducibility loss bifurcation really exists ( for @xmath68 small enough ) . in @xcite we will use the theory proposed in the previous one to study the asymptotic behavior of the reducibility loss bifurcations when the period goes to infinity . in the previous two articles several conjectures will be done .",
    "in @xcite we will support numerically this conjectures .",
    "we will give also numerical evidences of the self - renormalizable character of the bifurcation diagram of the figure [ flm parameter space ] when different values of the rotation number @xmath8 are considered .",
