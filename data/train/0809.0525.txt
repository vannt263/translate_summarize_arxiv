    "this paper originates in the experimental observations we made when studying the adsorption of gas in p@xmath0-type porous silicon @xcite .",
    "this porous system , formed on highly boron doped si(100 ) substrate , is composed of straight pores , perpendicular to the substrate , separated from each other by single crystal si walls of apparent constant thickness ( @xmath25 nm ) .",
    "the section of the pores by a plane parallel to the substrate is polygonal .",
    "the pore size distribution ( psd ) is large , for example @xmath3  nm for a porosity of @xmath4 . except the presence of different facets on the si walls which gives some roughness ,",
    "the amplitude of which is smaller than the apparent wall thickness and a fortiori than the pore size , the pore section does not vary along the pore axis .",
    "the pores are not interconnected .    at a first glance",
    ", this system can be hence classified as ordered porous system composed of independent pores .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the hysteretic behavior of such a system , i.e. the shape of the main loop and of subloops inside the main loop , is characteristic of the presence of a strong interaction mechanism between the pores @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] we have represented the main features which characterize this system .",
    "( i)- the boundary hysteresis loop , of type h2 in the international union of pur and applied chemists ( iupac ) classification @xcite , is asymmetrical with a broad condensation branch characteristic of the broad psd and a steeper evaporation branch which suggests , but not proves , that , as soon as the pressure is reduced to a critical value @xmath5 , the system begins to empty , leading to the emptying of the whole system in a avalanchelike manner .",
    "( ii)- if the emptying of the system is commenced when it is not completely filled , at points @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 on the boundary condensation branch for example , we obtain the so - called primary descending scanning curves ( pdscs ) . along the pdscs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] , evaporation occurs at pressure higher than @xmath5 which clearly shows that the evaporation pressure of a given pore depends on the state of the system .",
    "( iii)- the two subloops between the same pressure end points shown in inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] are not superimposable . for independent pores , according to preisach model @xcite , they should be .",
    "the pores of porous silicon interact strongly whereas they are not connected .",
    "similar observations have been made in other noninterconnected porous systems .",
    "mcm-41 and sba-15 @xcite , are composed of almost uniform cylindrical pores and exhibit hysteresis loops of type h1 with steep and parallel branches but , inside the main loop , the pdscs are qualitatively similar to that represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : hystbehavior ] . for sba-15",
    ", we have shown that two subloops between the same pressure end points are not congruent which proves unambiguously that the pores of sba-15 interact during the evaporation process @xcite .",
    "surprising though it may seem , the hysteretic behavior represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] is quite similar to that observed by brown @xcite in porous glass , a disordered porous material composed of cavities connected to one another by constrictions , a spongelike structure : the same hysteresis loop of type h2 , the same pdscs as porous silicon .",
    "mason @xcite has developped a model , the so - called pore blocking / percolation model , to explain the family of pdscs obtained by brown . from this model , in porous materials where the pores interact , the source of interactions is thought to be pore - pore intersections @xcite .",
    "the hysteretic behavior of sba-15 has been compared to that of kit-6 , an ordered mesoporous silica which consists of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) network of interconnected pores of almost cylindrical shape and same size .",
    "morishige and coworkers @xcite noted that despite a large difference in porous structure , the shape and thermal behavior of the adsorption hysteresis , as well as the sorption scanning behavior for these two materials , are indistinguishable .",
    "finally , if we disregard the boundary hysteresis loops , the shape of which depends on the porous material , h1 for mcm-41 , sba-15 and kit-6 , h2 for porous glass and p@xmath0-type porous silicon , the hysteretic features inside the main loop are qualitatively the same for all these porous systems and show that none of them is composed of independent pores .",
    "this suggests that the physical parameter which couple the pores is not interconnectivity .    the hysteresis loop and pdscs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] have been qualitatively reproduced using mean - field density - functional theory or monte carlo calculations applied to a disordered lattice - gas model or to a simulated disordered matrix @xcite .",
    "the calculations show the presence of multiple metastable states within the hysteresis region which are connected by pdscs similar to that experimentally observed . as noted by the authors ,",
    "these calculations reproduce the main features observed in disordered porous material without explicitly introducing pore blocking / percolation effects .    following these calculations",
    ", it has been proposed that the hysteresis loop of type h2 observed in porous silicon is not due to `` local pore blocking caused by individual constrictions of pore '' but is rather the consequence of a strong disorder imposed by `` large number of minor variations '' in pore diameter@xcite or by variation in the fluid / wall interaction along the pore @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed this idea @xcite and concluded that the disorder in each pore of porous silicon can not explain why the pores interact .    in the present paper",
    ", we will thus consider a new physical parameter , common to all these porous systems , which couples the pores during the adsorption - desorption process : the elastic deformation of the porous matrix .",
    "the deformations of porous materials caused by adsorption and condensation of gas is an old subject @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these deformations have been neglected in practically all the theoretical treatments of capillary condensation , that is , the condensed phase was always treated as a one component system of adsorbed molecules in the potential field of the adsorbent . however , as far back as 1956 , yates @xcite noted that `` the fact that the size changes do occur , even if small in magnitude , makes the assumption of an inert adsorbent , for physical adsorption , of very doubtful validity . ''",
    "hill first introduced , in the classical thermodynamics of adsorption , the porous matrix as a second element in addition to the adsorbate @xcite .",
    "following this thermodynamic development , quinn and mcintosh in a paper published in 1957 , showed that the free energy of the porous glass - butane and porous glass - water @xcite systems depends importantly on the elastic deformation of the porous matrix .",
    "recently , shen and monson , based on the same thermodynamic property relationships as that developed by hill , have made a monte carlo simulation study of gas adsorption in a semiflexible porous network @xcite . they show that the flexible network makes a significant difference to both the adsorption and desorption isotherms .",
    "the evaporation , and to a lesser extent the condensation branches are shifted towards lower pressures . at the end of the paper",
    ", the authors noted that `` the fact that the phase change involves a contraction of the solid volume may add to the barriers to the phase change and the ease with which hysteresis is exhibited by the system . ''",
    "the thermodynamic approach developed in the present paper is quite different from that of hill @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium condition for mass transfer is not given by the equality of the chemical potentials of the adsorbate and the vapor but depends on the variation of the free energy of the solid with the adsorbed amount .",
    "this equilibrium condition allows us to introduce , in the thermodynamic relationships , the elastic energy of the solid besides the surface free energy that is to connect the deformation of the solid to the variation of the surface free energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : elasdef ] , we present the results found in the literature dealing with the elastic deformation of porous materials . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : thermo ] , we establish a thermodynamic approach of adsorption - desorption process , which takes into account the elastic deformation of the porous matrix . in this thermodynamic approach",
    ", we use the experimental work of amberg and mcintosh .",
    "@xcite we estimate the numerical values of the different components of the free energy of the system adsorbate solid . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : qualitative ] , we show how the pores can interact through the elastic deformation of the pore walls and we present a qualitative description of the hysteretic behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] which is common to all porous materials whether the pores are interconnected or not .",
    "adsorption and desorption of gas cause deformations of the porous matrix .",
    "these deformations have been studied in a number of systems such as porous glass @xcite , charcoal @xcite , silica aerogel @xcite and porous silicon .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of the linear deformation depends on the stiffness of the bulk material , on the porosity , and on the properties of the adsorbed molecules . for adsorption of pentane , at ambient temperature , in p@xmath0-type porous silicon , the variation of the lattice parameter ( @xmath9 ) , along the [ 100 ] axis perpendicular to the substrate , measured with regard to the si substrate by x - ray diffraction observations ,",
    "is a few @xmath10 . for",
    "the other cited porous materials , the order of magnitude of the linear deformation ( @xmath11 ) is typically @xmath12 for water in charcoal and porous glass and a few @xmath13 for neon ( t=@xmath14  k ) in silica aerogel .    despite the porous materials cited above having very different morphologies , the deformation during the condensation and evaporation of fluids presents common features .",
    "figure  [ fig : schemdeltal ] represents schematically a hysteresis loop of type h2 and typical deformations observed in these porous materials during an adsorption - desorption cycle .    along the reversible path oa preceding capillary condensation , the formation of an adsorbed film results either in a marked extension of the porous material ( porous glass ) or in small or insignificant changes in the other materials .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) pressure exerted on the pore walls by the film is usually called spreading pressure . between points",
    "a and b , where the condensation process takes place , a contraction is generally observed . during this step ,",
    "the pores sequentially fill , from the smallest to the largest ; menisci are presumably formed at the top of the filled pores , and the thickness of the adsorbed film increases reversibly in the empty pores leading to a further extension of the porous material .",
    "therefore , the net contraction generally observed during capillary condensation is attributed to the negative pressure created under the concave menisci . at point b ,",
    "all the pores are filled .",
    "along bc , the upper region of the isotherm , a marked extension occurs , attributed to the vanishing of the negative pressure within the fluid as a result of the flattening of the concave menisci .",
    "conversely , along cd , marked contraction occurs due to large negative fluid pressure generated by the formation of concave menisci . in the region bcd ,",
    "both adsorption and deformation data are generally reversible except for pentane in porous silicon @xcite for which the authors note that at the pentane saturation pressure ( @xmath15  kpa ) the extension has not reached the maximum value found for full immersion in the liquid .",
    "it is necessary to increase the pressure above the vapor saturation pressure by slightly heating the liquid reservoir above the temperature of the sample to obtain a full wetting .",
    "we have never observed such a phenomenon in the case of adsorption of n@xmath16 , ar , or kr in porous silicon : as soon as the pores are filled ( point b ) , the adsorption - desorption path bcd is reversible .",
    "@xcite    along da , the pores empty by evaporation and the deformation recovers the initial value at point a. from a to o , the path is the reverse of that along oa .",
    "recently , it has been shown that , along cd , the lattice constant of solid kr ( @xmath17  k ) confined to mesoporous spherical cavities increases as the vapor pressure is decreased .",
    "@xcite as the increase in the interatomic distance of the fluid is equivalent to an increase in the negative liquid pressure value , this supports the above explanation  according to which the contraction of the porous matrix along cd is due to the increased value of the negative liquid pressure under menisci .",
    "the above results clearly display the deformation of the porous matrix during the reversible adsorption ( oa ) , the capillary condensation ( ab ) , and the evaporation ( da ) processes .",
    "our aim is now to establish the thermodynamic relationships which take into account the elastic deformation of the porous matrix during the adsorption - desorption process .",
    "when a porous matrix of surface area @xmath18 is brought into contact with @xmath19 gas molecules contained in a volume @xmath20 at a constant temperature @xmath21 , the thermodynamic potential of the adsorption system , including the porous solid ( so ) , the adsorbate ( @xmath22 ) and the gas reservoir ( @xmath23 ) is the free energy @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bulk free energies of the solid and of the vapor .",
    "@xmath28 , which includes the bulk of the adsorbate and the adsorbate - vapor and adsorbate - solid interfaces , depends , for isothermal conditions , on three extensive independent variables , @xmath29 , the volume of the adsorbed phase , @xmath30 , the number of adsorbed atoms , and @xmath18 , the surface of the porous solid .",

    "the equilibrium condition for mass transfer , at constant @xmath21 , @xmath34 , @xmath29 , @xmath35 , and @xmath18 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of solid atoms .",
    "as @xmath38= -@xmath39 since @xmath40 , equilibrium condition ( 3 ) becomes @xmath41    if the properties of the bulk of the porous solid are supposed to be unaffected by the adsorbed molecules , @xmath42 and equilibrium condition ( 4 ) becomes @xmath43 the study of the adsorbed phase can be then disconnected from that of the porous solid as is generally done .",
    "now , if the elastic deformation of the solid is taken into account , @xmath44 and the equilibrium condition is given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , contrary to what has been assumed in all the papers where the deformation of the solid has been taken into account .",
    "@xcite actually , as is shown below , the shift ( @xmath45 ) is small , but even small it can not be ignored if we want to treat consistently the influence of the elastic deformation on adsorption .",

    "independent measurements are hence necessary .    some investigators @xcite have measured the deformation of a porous glass rod and have observed a linear variation of the relative extension of the rod length @xmath80 with @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the rod length before and after adsorption and @xmath85 , a proportionality factor .    from eq .",

    "the surface term is not separated from the perturbation undergone by the bulk of the solid . moreover , this perturbation is not clearly depicted since the variation of the volume of the solid induced by adsorption , i.e. , the elastic energy , is not taken into account .      as shown above ,",
    "the variation of the surface free energy is proportional to the deformation .",
    "quinn and mcintosh were the first to use this fact to determine the variation of the surface free energy within the hysteresis loop by measuring the dimensional change of the solid ; in fact this can not be done any other way .    in the hysteresis region , it is interesting to estimate the variation of @xmath92 between two states @xmath134 corresponding to the same adsorbed amount , @xmath30 , on the two branches of the hysteresis loop as has been done by quinn and mcintosh for the porous glass - water and porous glass - butane @xcite systems .",

    "the question is why this occurs only when the pores are full of liquid . on the contrary ,",

    "the linear deformation is significantly higher for water adsorption than for butane adsorption which suggests that the deformation increases with the surface tension ( @xmath162  mj / m@xmath128 for water and @xmath163  mj / m@xmath128 for butane @xcite ) .",

    "we found that @xmath190  j / g for porous glass and porous silicon .",

    "the fluctuations of each of these two terms in adsorption experiments are certainly higher that @xmath191  j / g so that the hysteresis phenomenon should be unobserved for these porous materials .    at the end of this section",
    "we summarize a few important conclusions which can be extended to all the porous materials :    \\i ) the surface free energy is directly related to the elastic deformation of the solid and is a major component of @xmath192 , the total free energy of the two - component system .",
    "\\ii ) the variation of @xmath92 between two states @xmath134 corresponding to the same adsorbed amount , @xmath30 , on the two branches of the hysteresis loop is positive .",
    "this shows that the condensation branch represents the more stable states and that a barrier exists to the emptying of the porous system , the height of the barrier depending essentially on the solid deformation .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe qualitatively how the pores can interact during the adsorption - desorption process through the pore wall deformation .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ subsec : elasdef ] that the deformation of porous materials during the condensation - evaporation process presents common features .",
    "the amplitude of these deformations depends evidently on the stiffness of the porous material .",

    "intuitively , we could believe that the effect of the elastic deformation on the adsorption - desorption process would be small in stiff material and large in weak material .",

    "[ subsec : thermo ] , we have shown that the crucial parameter is the surface free energy , which is proportional to the linear elastic deformation and to the elastic constant of the solid , so that the effect of which we speak  the surface free energy change  can be as important in stiff material such as porous silicon or porous glass as in weak material such as aerogel .    at this stage",
    ", we must specify the limits of the following discussion .",
    "it concerns porous materials for which :    \\(1 ) the notion of pores separated by walls makes sense , which is not the case of the low density aerogels @xcite which rather consist of void in which some small solid particle impurities have aggregated .",
    "\\(2 ) the change in pore size or volume upon condensation or evaporation can be neglected which is not the case of most of aerogels .",
    "@xcite this does not mean that the effect that we analyse in this paper does not exist in these materials  the thermodynamics approach developed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : thermo ] is generic  this means that this effect is in addition to others which complicates the analysis .",
    "for example , the analysis of subloops inside the boundary hysteresis loop which is essential to determine whether a porous material is composed of independent pores or not is rendered problematic if the change in pore size can not be neglected .    in the present section ,",
    "we describe qualitatively how fluid molecules adsorbed in neighboring pores can interact through the elastic deformation of the pore walls . basing on this interaction mechanism and on the hysteretic behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] , we then propose a qualitative description of the pore filling and emptying .",
    "the linear relationship between the variation of the surface free energy and the elastic deformation of the solid [ eq .",
    "( 32 ) ] is the result of equilibrium conditions .",
    "the first , given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) corresponds to chemical equilibrium , the second , given by eq .",
    "( 24 ) , corresponds to mechanical equilibrium .",
    "adsorption or capillary condensation of gas in a given pore causes elastic deformation not only of its inner pore walls but also of the inner walls of its neighbors and thus causes a change of their surface free energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : schempore ] gives , for example , a picture of the interaction between a filled pore with a meniscus and surrounding larger empty pores with an adsorbed film on their walls .",
    "the negative pressure of the liquid in the filled pore tends to contract its inner walls whereas the inner walls of the neighboring empty pores are submitted to the spreading pressure exerted by the adsorbate .",
    "the forces exerted on both sides of the pore walls create elastic stresses in the solid , which reduce both the contraction of the inner walls of the filled pore and the extension of the inner walls of the empty pores .",
    "thus , the surface free energy of a pore , and hence the adsorbed amount if it is empty ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : amberggamma ] and [ fig : ambergads ] ) or the liquid pressure , according to eqs .",
    "( 35 ) and ( 38 ) , if it is filled , depends on the state of the neighboring pores .      based on this interaction mechanism ,",
    "we give here a qualitative description of the pore filling and emptying .",
    "we take p@xmath0-type porous silicon as an example , the morphology of which is pretty well known and has the advantage of being easily and accurately schematized as a 2d image @xcite such as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : stepads ] and [ fig : stepdes ] .",
    "the beginning of the condensation process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stepads](a ) where the smallest pores are filled .",
    "they are randomly distributed in the porous matrix , most of them being surrounded by larger pores still empty .",
    "the walls of the neighboring empty pores contract compared to their states before the filling of the central pore , their surface free energy increases , resulting in a decrease of the adsorbed amount ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ambergads ] ) .",
    "thus , the presence of a filled pore tends to delay the filling of its neighbors towards higher pressure or at least does not favor their filling . during the condensation process",
    "the filled pores are not grouped but rather randomly scattered . the order according to which the pores fill",
    "is not perturbed by the interaction mechanism : they fill sequentially from the narrowest to the largest .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the extension of the condensation branch on the pressure axis is representative of the pore size distribution .",
    "as shown below , it is not the case for evaporation .    in the beginning of the condensation process",
    ", the average distance between the filled pores is the longer as they are fewer .",
    "the interaction between them can be neglected .",
    "they do not `` see '' each other .",
    "the pdscs shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] and [ fig : pdsc ] indicate that as the reversal point m on the condensation branch approaches the lowest closure point of the hysteresis loop , the hysteresis phenomenon is less and less important .",
    "these two observations suggest that the emptying of filled pores surrounded by empty pores and located far from other filled pores is quasireversible .",
    "as the vapor pressure is increased , larger pores , in various environments , fill .",
    "figure  [ fig : stepads](b ) illustrates two extreme cases : two filled pores of similar size , number 1 with neighboring empty pores , number 2 with neighboring filled pores .",
    "the walls of the filled pore are less contracted in the first case than in the second .",
    "clearly , the surface free energy of these two pores is different and this can change their evaporation pressure . the pdscs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystbehavior ] indicate that the hysteresis phenomenon becomes increasingly important as the reversal point tends to the highest closure point of the hysteresis loop .",
    "since , as we saw previously , a filled pore surrounded by empty pores fills and empties quasireversibly , this suggests that the emptying of a pore surrounded by filled pores is blocked by the presence of the neighboring filled pores .",
    "this idea is supported by the calculations of the previous section which show that when the porous material is completely filled , there is an energy barrier to evaporation , the height of which depends essentially on the elastic deformation .",
    "consider now the boundary evaporation branch . as the pressure is decreased from c to d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemdeltal ] ) , the porous material contracts under the effect of the negative liquid pressure created under the concave menisci at the top of the pores .",
    "as one further decreases the pressure , the porous system begins to empty .    at this stage ,",
    "very little is known about the exact manner in which the pores empty . according to the pore blocking model and its derivatives , a concave meniscus is formed at the liquid - vapor interface and recedes from the interface to the inside of the porous solid , at thermodynamic equilibrium . in p@xmath0-type porous silicon ,",
    "this model has been ruled out .",
    "@xcite for example , the experiment of wallacher _ et al .",
    "@xcite shows that a porous layer can drain across layers , several microns thick , full of liquid . in porous glass , the experimental observations of quinn and mcintosh",
    "do not match this model either .",
    "this suggests that the evaporation of fluid from porous materials is either via the formation of gas bubbles or via the sudden propagation of the menisci leading to evaporation out of equilibrium .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in a future paper .",
    "@xcite    what is known is that the evaporation branch is steeper than the condensation branch , which indicates that the evaporation occurs in an avalanchelike manner .",
    "some pores begin to empty [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stepdes](a ) ] , leading to the extension of the neighboring pore walls .",
    "the neighboring filled pores are now in contact with empty pores which , as we have seen above , facilitates their draining , leading to the emptying of some of them in a single cooperative event [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : stepdes](b ) ] .",
    "note that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : stepdes](b ) , the distribution of the empty pores , around the two pores at the origin of the evaporation , is schematic , the exact manner in which the empty pores `` propagate '' being probably more complicated .",
    "avalanche phenomena have been experimentally observed in draining of superfluid helium from nuclepore .",
    "@xcite the authors attributed this behavior to the presence of both the mobile helium film and pore - pore intersections .",
    "however , since the presence of pore - pore intersections has no significant role in the evaporation process , their presence is probably not relevant in these avalanche phenomena . to confirm this idea",
    "it would be interesting to carry out such experiments in porous silicon .",
    "pore - space correlation in porous glass has been studied using ultrasonic attenuation and light scattering .",
    "@xcite these studies show that the distributions of the empty pores are quite different on filling and on draining . during the condensation process , no long - range correlation of the empty pores are observed , while , on drainage , the empty pores exhibit long range correlations with a fractal structure which , according to the authors , suggests that the drainage can be modeled by analogy to invasion percolation .",
    "we have seen above that in porous glass , the experimental observations of quinn and mcintosh do not match a pore blocking / percolation process . according to our wall elastic deformation model ,",
    "the emptying of pores occurs from neighbor to neighbor , a mechanism which seems difficult to distinguish , at a first glance , from percolation .",
    "it is the reason why the hysteretic behavior simulated by mason @xcite resembles qualitatively the experimental hysteretic behavior of porous silicon .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the adsorption and condensation of gas induce elastic deformation of the porous matrix .",
    "the reversible formation of an adsorbed film , which preceeds capillary condensation , results in an extension of the porous material while , when the pores are full of liquid , a marked contraction occurs due to large negative liquid pressure generated by the formation of concave menisci .",
    "the elastic deformation exhibits an hysteresis loop in the same pressure region as the adsorption phenomenon .    in the present paper , we develop a thermodynamic approach which takes into account these elastic deformations .",
    "in addition to the adsorbate and the adsorbate - solid interface , the two - component system we consider includes the elastic energy stored in the solid during adsorption , a parameter which has been always ignored in the physics of adsorption .    our theoretical approach is developed in parallel to the experimental work of amberg and mcintosh , @xcite who measured both the length change of a porous glass rod and the adsorbed amount during adsorption of water . in the region of reversible adsorption , before capillary condensation occurs , they found that the relative extension of the rod is proportional to the decrease of the surface free energy .    taking into account the elastic energy of the solid ,",
    "we explain why the variation of the surface free energy depends on the deformation and on the elastic constants of the porous solid .",
    "the surface free energy is an important component of the total free energy : the assumption of an inert solid in physics of adsorption is totally unjustified .    in the hysteresis region , we show that the condensation branch represents the more stable states and that an energy barrier exists to the evaporation , the height of which depends essentially on the elastic deformation of the substrate .",
    "since the surface free energy of pores is directly related to the deformation of their inner walls , the fluid inside them interacts through the deformation of the pore walls . based on this interaction mechanism and on the shape of the descending scanning curves which are similar for all the studied porous systems",
    ", we propose a scenario for the filling and emptying of pores .    during the condensation process",
    ", the interaction mechanism does not modify the order according to which the pores fill , i.e. , from the smallest to the largest .",
    "the emptying of a filled pore surrounded by empty pores is quasireversible and becomes irreversible when it is surrounded by filled pores .",
    "this provides an explanation for the steepness of the boundary evaporation branch .",
    "when the porous system begins to empty , the filled pores in contact with empty pores will first empty , leading to the emptying of their neighbors and then of the whole system in an avalanchelike manner .",
    "the irreversibility of the adsorption - desorption process in porous media would not originate in the irreversibility of the process in individual pores but would be a property of the whole system .",
    "mcm-41 and sba-15 porous materials exhibit boundary hysteresis loops of type h1 , with steep and parallel condensation and evaporation branches while porous silicon and porous glass present hysteresis loop of type h2 with a broad condensation branch and a steep evaporation branch .",
    "two different mechanisms for evaporation were attributed to these two hysteresis loops : evaporation at thermodynamic equilibrium for h1 type , pore blocking / percolation process for h2 type .",
    "the present paper and previous ones show the fallacy of this classification : the cylindrical pores of sba-15 and mcm-41 do not empty at equilibrium , @xcite and there is no pore blocking / percolation process in porous silicon @xcite and in porous glass .",
    "hysteresis loops of type h1 and h2 could be simply characteristic of a narrow pore size distribution ( psd ) and of a large psd , respectively , whatever the shape of the pores is and whether they are connected or not .",

    "the coupling parameter is the surface free energy which is transmitted from a pore to its neighbors through the elastic deformation of the pore walls .",
