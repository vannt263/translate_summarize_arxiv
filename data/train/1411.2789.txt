    "<S> a long standing problem in quantum mechanics is the minimum number of observables required for the characterisation of unknown pure quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to this problem is specially important for the developing field of high - dimensional quantum information processing . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that any pure @xmath0-dimensional state is unambiguously reconstructed by measuring 5 observables , that is , via projective measurements onto the states of 5 orthonormal bases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in our method the total number of different measurement outcomes ( @xmath1 ) scales linearly with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the state reconstruction is robust against experimental errors and requires simple post - processing , regardless of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme through the reconstruction of 8-dimensional quantum states , encoded in the momentum of single photons .    with the development of high - dimensional quantum information processing techniques @xcite , the total dimension @xmath0 of quantum systems employed in experiments increases at a fast pace . </S>",
    "<S> since the total number @xmath2 of measurement outcomes required by conventional quantum tomography methods scales with @xmath3 @xcite , it is of paramount importance the search for tomographic protocols specially adapted to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> that is , schemes which require a lower @xmath2 and a reduced complexity of the post - processing methods . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is possible to consider _ a priori _ information about the set of states to be characterised . </S>",
    "<S> for example , rank-@xmath4 quantum states are reconstructed , with high probability , with @xmath2 of the order of @xmath5 via compressed sensing techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nearly matrix product states are determined with @xmath2 linear in @xmath0 and post - processing that is polynomial in the system size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> permutationally invariant quantum states of @xmath6 qubits ( @xmath7 ) are reconstructed with @xmath8 @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study the characterisation of unknown pure quantum states via projective measurements . in 1933 , w. pauli @xcite considered the unambiguous characterisation of pure states from probability distributions generated by the measurement of a fixed set of observables . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the number of observables must be larger than @xmath9 for @xmath10 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that almost all pure quantum states can be characterised by a set of probability distributions generated by 4 observables , that is , projective measurements onto a fixed set of @xmath11 bases @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) independently of the dimension @xmath0 . in our case @xmath14 , which is an improvement compared with quantum tomography based on mutually unbiased bases @xcite , sic - povm @xcite and compressed sensing @xcite , which require @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the order of @xmath18 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> pure states can also be reconstructed via the expectation values @xcite of a fixed set of observables . in this case , @xmath19 observables are required at least , where @xmath20 is a quantity that scales with the logarithm of the dimension . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the value of @xmath2 is larger than in our proposal .    </S>",
    "<S> the exception to our first characterisation is a statistically unlikely null measure set @xmath21 of pure states . </S>",
    "<S> such states can be characterised by adding a fifth measurement basis @xmath22 , which detects whether a pure state is in @xmath21 or not . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is possible to define a new set of @xmath11 bases to characterise the state . </S>",
    "<S> these bases are similar to @xmath12 but defined on a lower dimensional subspace . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the set of pure states is decomposed into a finite number of disjoint sets of states such that each set is reconstructed with a particular set of five bases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any pure state can be reconstructed with projective measurements on no more than @xmath23 bases , that is , @xmath24 . an interesting feature of each set of @xmath23 bases is that they allow us to certify the initial assumption on the purity of the state to be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> this class of certification can also be achieved by reconstructing pure states via expectation values @xcite but at the expense of a much higher @xmath2 than in our proposal .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the feasibility of our tomographic scheme with the experimental characterisation of eight - dimensional quantum states encoded on the transverse momentum of single - photons . </S>",
    "<S> the preparation of the states is affected by white noise , which renders the states slightly impure , and the detection process by poison noise . in spite of these conditions the obtained fidelities are higher than @xmath25 with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with numerical simulations which consider realistic noise levels in the preparation of the unknown state as well as in the detection process . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that the effective characterisation of unknown high - dimensional pure quantum states by means of a reduced number of measurement outcomes is feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0-dimensional quantum state can be expanded as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the identity operator , @xmath29 form the generalised bloch vector and @xmath30 are a traceless , hermitian representation of the generators of the group @xmath31 such as the generalised gell - mann basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this consists of @xmath32 diagonal operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 non - diagonal operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> any pure state @xmath40 satisfies the following set of @xmath41 equations @xmath42 interestingly , @xmath32 of the above equations univocally characterise a certain dense set of pure states . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the set of @xmath32 equations with @xmath43 which allows us to solve eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phases ] ) recursively , up to a null measure set of pure states . in order to calculate the traces of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phases ] ) we consider rank - one projective measurements associated to the eigenvectors of @xmath44 and @xmath45 with eigenvalues @xmath46 , that is , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath47 vectors can be always sorted in four orthogonal bases . for @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> these bases are given by @xmath49 where addition of labels is carried out modulo @xmath0 and @xmath50 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for odd dimensions we considered the integer part of @xmath51 and every basis is completed with @xmath52 . defining @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) as the probability of projecting the state @xmath55 onto the eigenvector of @xmath44 ( @xmath56 ) with eigenvalue @xmath46 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phases ] ) becomes @xmath57 , where @xmath58 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> table [ table ] associates bases @xmath12 with the eigenvectors of @xmath44 and @xmath45 with eigenvalues @xmath46 and probabilities @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> .association between the four bases , @xmath59 generators and transition probabilities . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the equations @xmath57 can be recursively solved leading to @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is determined by normalisation . </S>",
    "<S> if one of the coefficients @xmath63 vanishes then the system of equations can not be recursively solved . however , the remaining equations and the normalisation condition are enough to reconstruct the state . </S>",
    "<S> this also holds in the case of two consecutive vanishing coefficients . for two </S>",
    "<S> non - consecutive vanishing coefficients the system of equations has infinite solutions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in @xmath64 the set of equations is @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . if @xmath69 or @xmath70 then all left sides vanish . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there are states that can not be singled out via @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> these states form a manifold @xmath21 of dimension @xmath72 and , consequently , are statistically unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , if pure states are randomly selected then with probability @xmath73 they would be out of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a total of @xmath47 measurement outcomes , corresponding to projective measurements onto states of bases @xmath71 , are informationally complete on the set of pure states up to the null measure set @xmath21 .    the introduction of a fifth basis @xmath22 , the canonical basis which is first to be measured , allows us to determine whether a state belongs to the manifold @xmath21 or not depending on the number of vanishing coefficients detected . </S>",
    "<S> if the state is in @xmath21 and has @xmath74 null coefficients , then we can reconstruct the state into the subspace associated to the @xmath75 non - vanishing coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this is done with the bases @xmath71 ( @xmath76 ) but defined for a subspace of dimension @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , any pure state can be reconstructed via projective measurements onto , at most , @xmath23 orthonormal bases or equivalently with @xmath77 .    in the @xmath78 qubits case , separable bases @xmath22 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 correspond to the eigenstates of the local operators @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> entangled bases @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be mapped onto bases @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively by applying the quantum fourier transform ( qft)@xcite twice . </S>",
    "<S> this can be optimally implemented with the order of @xmath86 @xcite hadamard and conditional two - qubit phase gates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our tomographic scheme is reduced to simple local measurements and qft . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has been experimentally realised in photonic qubits @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , neutral molecules @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements onto the set of bases allow us to certify the assumed purity of the unknown state . </S>",
    "<S> a state @xmath87 is pure if and only if the equation @xmath88 holds for every @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these conditions for @xmath90 are enough to ensure that @xmath87 determines a pure state . indeed , given that @xmath87 is a quantum state then @xmath91 for a given operator @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> so , every entry of @xmath87 satisfies @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the @xmath95th column of @xmath92 . if @xmath90 the @xmath32 equations @xmath96 hold if and only if vectors @xmath94 and @xmath97 are parallel for every @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath87 is pure . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for any set of five bases .    </S>",
    "<S> tomographic schemes reconstruct quantum states in matrix space . since quantum states form a null measure set in matrix space , noisy measurement results lead to matrices that do not represent quantum states . to overcome this problem experimental data </S>",
    "<S> is post - processed with maximum likelihood estimation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of our method is that it delivers a vector of the underlying hilbert space for any set of noisy probabilities , being the normalisation of this vector the only procedure required to obtain a pure state from noisy probabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> the scheme here proposed is based on a priori information about the purity of the state to be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is difficult to realise in current experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible to generate nearly pure states such as @xmath99 here , the generation process is affected by white noise , which mixes the target pure state @xmath100 with the maximally mixed state @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the process is given by the real number @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> this model is in agreement with our experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the following lower bound for the fidelity holds @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the probability distribution generated by measurements on the canonical basis @xmath22 and @xmath106 is the maximal amount of noise introduced by the photo - detection process . for a uniform state ( i.e. , @xmath107 for every @xmath108 ) of a composite system of @xmath78 qubits </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to keep a constant large lower bound while increasing the number of qubits , @xmath106 must decrease as @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the average fidelity @xmath111 onto the complete hilbert space and the square root of its variance @xcite as functions of @xmath78 considering white and poisson noises .    </S>",
    "<S> the setup employed to implement and test our proposal is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the state preparation stage has a continuous - wave laser operated at 690 nm and an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is used to generate controlled optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> optical attenuators ( not shown for sake of clarity ) decrease the mean photon number per pulse to the single - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter , single photons are sent through two transmissive spatial light modulators ( slm1 and slm2 ) , each one formed by two polarisers , quarter wave plates ( qwp ) and a liquid crystal display ( lcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> slm1 and slm2 work in amplitude - only and phase - only modulation configuration , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> slm2 is placed on the image plane of slm1 , and the 8-dimensional quantum system is generated with 8 parallel slits addressed on the slms . </S>",
    "<S> after slm2 the non - normalised state of the transmitted photon is given by @xmath112 @xcite where @xmath113 represents the state of the single photon crossing the @xmath114th - slit . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath115 is the transmission for each slit controlled by slm1 ; @xmath116 is the phase of each slit addressed by slm2 , and @xmath78 is a normalisation constant . </S>",
    "<S> the different values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 are configured by the grey level of the pixels in the slms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we addressed in the slms slits with the width of 2 pixels , and 1 pixel of separation between them , where each pixel is a square of 32 @xmath117 of side length.since a 3-qubit system is a 8-dimensional quantum system , state @xmath55 can be used to simulate a @xmath9-qubit system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we generated the state @xmath118 $ ] with equal real probability amplitudes , the state @xmath119 $ ] analogous ( up to locc @xcite ) to the ghz state @xcite and the w state @xmath120 $ ] @xcite .            to guarantee the purity of the spatial qudit states , it is necessary to observe a high visibility in the interference patterns in the far - field plane of the slms @xcite . the value of @xmath102 can be obtained from the relation @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the observed visibility in the far - field plane . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath123 leading to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the generated states have a purity of @xmath125 .    in order to realise the projections onto the states of the @xmath23 bases @xmath12 we use two additional modulators , slm3 and slm4 , working in amplitude - only and phase - only , respectively , and a point - like avalanche photo - detector ( apd ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slms in the projective measurement stage ( see fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 ) are addressed with slits whose amplitudes and phases are defined to implement the projections required by our method . at the detection plane , </S>",
    "<S> the single - photon detection rate is proportional to the probability of projecting the initial state ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) into the required basis states of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ base1 ] ) @xcite .    from the experimental data we calculated the probability distributions associated to the 5 bases @xmath12 for the three initial states . with these probability distributions and using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phases ] ) , for the appropriate set of @xmath23 bases , we obtained a set of vectors , which were then normalised to obtain the final reconstructed states . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity @xmath129 of the initial states with respect to the expected ones are @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> these were calculated by considering the effect of the poisson noise in the detection process and selecting the highest and smallest fidelity between the expected state and the estimated state for a particular noisy set of distributions . for comparison purposes we consider an experiment with a similar configuration @xcite where two pure states with non vanishing , real coefficients in @xmath133 were reconstructed by means of measurements on mutually unbiased bases achieving @xmath134 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we achieved higher fidelities with a total of @xmath136 projective measurements instead of @xmath137 , as in the compared case . </S>",
    "<S> the states reconstructed with our method are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a ] . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a](a ) , [ fig : a](c ) and [ fig : a](e ) exhibits real parts of reconstructed density matrices , compared with the expected ones ( insets ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a](b ) , [ fig : a](d ) and [ fig : a](f ) show imaginary parts of the respective matrices , compared with the theoretical predictions ( insets ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that projections onto the eigenstates of a fixed set of @xmath11 rank-@xmath0 observables characterise all pure states of a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system up to a null measure set of dimension @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath47 measurements compares favourably with the typical @xmath3 scaling of measurements of known generic tomographic methods . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of a fifth observable allows us to detect whether a state belongs to the null measure set or not . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , then it is always possible to construct a new set of @xmath11 observables which determines unambiguously the state . </S>",
    "<S> all sets of five observables allow us to certify whether the initial assumption on the purity of the state holds or not . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of our scheme in the characterisation of states in @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> we achieved high fidelities by means of a reduced number of measurement outcomes and a simple post - processing method . </S>"
