    "anderson orthogonality catastrophe ( aoc ) is one of the simplest many - body effects in condensed matter physics .",
    "it was first described by anderson  @xcite in 1967 and refers to the vanishing of the overlap between the unperturbed and perturbed many - body ground states as a power law in the number of particles in the system .",
    "this results from the non - adiabatic response of the system to a sudden perturbation .",
    "aoc contributes to a number of fermi - edge singularities ( fes ) , e.g. , in the kondo effect  @xcite or in the x - ray edge problem  @xcite . in the x - ray edge problem ,",
    "the sudden and localised perturbation is realized through the x - ray excitation of a core electron that leaves behind a localised attracting ( hole ) potential . here , other many - body responses may play a role , e.g. , the so - called mahan - nozires - dedominicis response or mahan s exciton  @xcite in fes of photoabsorption spectra .",
    "however , in the case of photo - emission experiments where the excited core electron leaves the sample , the physics is governed by aoc alone  @xcite .",
    "this will be our focus in this article .",
    "aoc was originally introduced and discussed for bulk samples with a large number of particles ( corresponding to the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "the conduction electrons respond to the attractive core - hole potential by slightly lowering their single particle energy levels .",
    "although the overlap between the single particle states before and after the photo - excitation remains very close to one , this is not true for the overlap between the corresponding many - body ground states . in aoc the many - body overlap between the unperturbed and perturbed ground states",
    "@xmath0 vanishes as a power law in the number of participating electrons @xmath1 as @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of states of the conduction band at the fermi level and @xmath5 is the width of the conduction band @xcite ; @xmath6 is the phase shift at the fermi energy .    in recent years ,",
    "the fabrication of high - quality samples with a finite number of electrons ranging from very few to , say , several thousands , has become possible .",
    "a hallmark example are the effectively two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots realized in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite where electrons occupy well defined discrete levels that can be probed by coulomb - blockade measurements @xcite .",
    "the size of the sample can even be made smaller than the phase - coherence length of the system .",
    "these samples are referred to as ballistic .",
    "consequently , in the spirit of quantum chaos , the geometry of the quantum dot becomes important as the wavefunctions and energy eigenstates depend sensitively on the geometry of the system s boundary due to self - interference effects  @xcite .",
    "this new aspect , besides the much smaller number of electrons in the conduction band , has to be contrasted to bloch waves in metals .",
    "the existence of mesoscopic fluctuations is another feature that governs the behaviour of such systems .",
    "all these differences from bulk systems have made mesoscopic systems an interesting object of research in the context of aoc and fes  @xcite .    here , we focus in particular on yet another difference from the bulk case that can easily be realized in mesoscopic structures , namely , the existence of degenerate energy levels ( shells ) : quantum dots with a few up to few hundred electrons are often very well described by a parabolic confining potential  @xcite that leads , in close analogy to the harmonic oscillator , to the organisation of the energy levels in shells ( see fig .  [ pqd ] ) .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to study aoc in the presence of degeneracies and shell structures as they occur in realistic , parabolic quantum dots where , furthermore , an external magnetic field can be used to control the lifting of degeneracies .",
    "we show that the presence of shells considerably alters aoc of the system and leads to deviations from the power - law behaviour observed in the bulk systems .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe our model that follows the fermi golden rule approach to fes in the x - ray edge problem introduced by ohtaka and tanabe in refs .",
    "the sudden , local perturbation arising from the core hole is modelled as a rank - one perturbation . in sec .",
    "[ result ] we present our results for aoc in parabolic quantum dots .",
    "first , we focus on the role of shell effects and neglect the dependence of the perturbation strength on the position of the perturbation .",
    "we then turn to the more realistic case where the dependence of the perturbation strength on the position , induced by the non - homogeneous electron intensity in pqd , as well as mesoscopic fluctuations are taken into account . for each case",
    "we consider both weak and strong magnitude of attractive perturbation and a weak magnetic control .",

    "we start with a discussion of the energy levels and wavefunctions of the ( unperturbed ) pqd , paying special attention to the degeneracy of levels and their organisation in shells as this has crucial impact on the anderson overlap .",
    "its calculation is discussed in the second subsection .",
    "we describe the unperturbed system by the hamiltonian @xmath13 where the operator @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) creates ( annihilates ) a particle in the unperturbed eigenstate @xmath16 with eigenenergy @xmath17 .",

    "the dashed straight lines are a guide to the eye .",
    "this observed linearity is a manifestation of scaling behaviour of @xmath0 for constant @xmath144 of a pqd subject to weak perturbation in the quasi - degenerate limit . for comparison , we have calculated overlap and phase - shift at fermi energy for harmonic oscillators with 35 equidistant energy levels , among which @xmath149 are empty . in this weak perturbation regime , as expected , the results ( marked as boxes in fig .  [ ovph ] )",
    "match with the five curves obtained for pqd .",
    "note that the phase shift decreases as we go to higher clusters ( i.e. , higher fillings ) .",
    "deviations from linearity occur as soon as the different clusters start to mix .",

    "when @xmath169 equals to @xmath167 , the many - body overlap goes to @xmath139 .",

    "[ mesovvsn ] .",
    "when the perturbing position is chosen close to the centre of the dot where most of the wave - functions ( all with non - zero @xmath163 ) have zero amplitude , the overlap is indeed somewhat larger than in the uniform amplitude case ( see the open circles in fig .

    "consequently , there are deviations from the uniform amplitude case keeping the qualitative nature unchanged .",
    "the deviations would be averaged out after averaging over a large number of realizations .",
    "accordingly , the deviations from the anderson power law exponent , discussed in section [ subsec_devpowerlaw ] , apply now to the averaged many - body overlap .",
    "0.5 cm    now we focus on the mesoscopic fluctuations and discuss the probability distribution of overlaps @xmath0 for two systems around half filling ( fig .  [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen four different strengths @xmath94 of attractive perturbation , its position @xmath153 is assumed to be uniformly spread over the pqd and collected over @xmath171 different values to estimate the overlap distribution . because of the circular symmetry of the pqd @xmath165 is independent of the angular positioning of the perturbation and depends only on @xmath153 .",
    "for the weak perturbation case , as expected , the distribution @xmath172 has a large peak near @xmath173 ( see fig .",
    "[ stat1](a ) ) .",
    "since , even for weak perturbation the overlap can be very small when a cluster is less than half filled , one can find a very small but finite probability for very small overlaps . increasing the strength of the perturbation ,",
    "the overlap distribution becomes even wider before reducing in width towards very strong perturbations .",

    "[ ovvc ] , one can see that the overlap for a fixed number excess electrons ( number of extra electrons from closest completely filled cluster ) is mirror symmetric about @xmath179 to the overlap for a pqd with same number of holes ( deficit in number of electrons to form a completely filled cluster ) .",
    "however , for stronger perturbations , when different clusters start to mix , the particle - hole symmetry does not hold . for bigger systems , as the mixing starts for weaker perturbation ( as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ ovanl ] ) the asymmetry in many - body overlap appears for much smaller strength of perturbation . with increasing @xmath8 ( positive or negative ) , @xmath165 decreases .",
    "however , the reduction , beyond the symmetric regime of small @xmath8 , is much steeper in the case of repulsive @xmath8 than for attractive @xmath8 .",
    "we have studied the anderson orthogonality catastrophe ( aoc ) for experimentally accessible parabolic quantum dots .",
    "our results show that in addition to strength and position of the perturbation , level degeneracy and the rearrangement of shell structures are important in determining the behaviour of the many - body overlap .    as a reference system",
    ", we started with a simplified pqd with uniform amplitudes .",
    "for such a system , shell effects in the anderson overlap are strong , especially in the quasi - degenerate limit .",
    "this shell effect survives in the mesoscopic case as well , even in presence of mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "the rearrangement of energy levels between the shells leads to deviations from the well - known anderson power law of the overlap .",
    "it is especially prominent for intermediate perturbation strengths when the power law behaviour of independent cluster approximation in small @xmath12 regime gets modified by an exponential decay with system size in the large @xmath12 regime ( fig .",
    "[ ovanl ] ) .    in the mesoscopic situation with",
    "position dependent wave - function amplitudes , the position of the perturbation strongly influences the anderson overlap .",
    "we obtained a broad distribution of overlaps for various positioning of the localized perturbations .",
    "this distribution scales with the overlap @xmath180 obtained for a system with uniform amplitudes .",
    "our results underline the richness of samples in the mesoscopic regime with respect to many - body physics . in the present study",
    ", it is in particular the degeneracy of levels in parabolic quantum dots that makes aoc an interesting topic with new features that go well beyond the well understood bulk metallic case .",
    "for a contact - type or rank - one perturbation , the many - body overlap can be expressed in terms of all single particle energy states  @xcite as @xmath181 depending on the perturbation strength , the lowest level @xmath182 of a chaotic system gets shifted by a larger amount ( `` formation of a bound state '' ) than the other levels that are bound by their neighbors . for pqd , this scenario applies to the lowest level of each cluster that can be shifted more compared to all other levels of the cluster in application of the same perturbation .",
    "for example , the lowest level of fermi cluster ( @xmath110 ) can have a shift of order @xmath183 with @xmath91 and @xmath184 , the energy gap with the neighbouring filled cluster ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "all other levels of the cluster ( @xmath110 ) can be lowered by an amount @xmath186 , where @xmath187 and @xmath7 is the separation between adjacent levels in a cluster .",
    "thus in the quasi - degenerate limit ( @xmath188 ) and for small pqd , the clusters remain well separated",
    ". therefore we can confine our considerations to the contributions from levels deep inside the fermi cluster to obtain many - body overlap .",
    "however , for very large clusters ( @xmath189 ) , all clusters are at comparable separations as their constituting levels . in this case",
    ", in addition to the fermi cluster ( with its lowest level being somewhat seperated ) , we have to take into account the neighbouring clusters as well . to incorporate the distinctions between boundary levels and core levels in the expression of overlap in eq .",
    "( [ ovorgf ] ) , let us use the index @xmath190 and @xmath191 for the lowest levels of filled and empty clusters , respectively .",
    "again , depending on the parent clusters , the lowest levels are at different energy separation from nearest neighbouring cluster .",
    "thus we introduce two more subscripts , @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively , for filled and empty clusters in unperturbed and perturbed eigen - values in eq .",

    "<S> the finite number of electrons in pqd causes aoc to be incomplete , with a broad distribution of many - body overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> this is a signature of mesoscopic fluctuations and is in agreement with earlier results obtained for chaotic quantum dots . here , we focus on the effects of degeneracies in pqds , realized through their inherent shell structures , on aoc . </S>",
    "<S> we find rich and interesting behaviours as a function of the strength and position of the perturbation , the system size , and the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , even for weak perturbations , we observe a pronounced aoc which is related to the degeneracy of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the power law decay of the many - body overlap as a function of increasing number of particles is modified in comparison to the metallic case due to rearrangements of energy levels in different shells . </S>"
