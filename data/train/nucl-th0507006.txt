    "in the kohn  sham framework , the nuclear many - body system is reduced to a set of single - particle equations with classical fields @xcite .",
    "this framework allows one to reproduce the exact ground - state energy , scalar and vector densities , and chemical potential , provided that the mean - field energy functional is accurately calibrated . in some cases ,",
    "however , the single - particle levels are actually weighted averages of multiple states @xcite .",
    "to illustrate this point , consider the ground - state of @xmath1p@xmath2 , which has the configuration @xmath3 .",
    "the angular momenta of the valence proton and neutron couple ; therefore , the calculated kohn ",
    "sham ground - state is actually a doublet . to determine the true level orderings and splittings , one can supplement the kohn  sham equations with a tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) analysis of the particle - hole states .",
    "the particle - hole matrix elements are sums of two - body dirac matrix elements , and the particle - hole interaction is determined by the underlying effective field theory .",
    "if retardation is neglected , the interaction is given by ( yukawa ) meson - exchange potentials ( with appropriate spin - isospin operators ) .",
    "this approach has been used to study ordinary nuclei @xcite and single @xmath0-hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the case of single @xmath0-hypernuclei is particularly interesting as no single isovector coupling is allowed , and there are no exchange contributions , since the @xmath0 and the nucleon are distinguishable .",
    "this will allow us to focus on isoscalar exchange in the effective interaction .",
    "there are no free parameters in this tda analysis . as a result",
    ", there are only three possible ways to adjust this method : vary the level of truncation in the underlying lagrangian , introduce additional degrees of freedom , or include higher - order contributions in the particle - hole interaction .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the effect of these modifications on the accuracy of this approach , particularly the inclusion of higher - order terms involving gradient couplings .",
    "we have applied this specific improvement to calculations of ground - state , @xmath0-particle  nucleon - hole splittings in single @xmath0-hypernuclei , such as @xmath4o .",
    "the higher - order terms that are of interest here are those involving the tensor coupling to the neutral vector meson ; these terms incorporate the tensor force into the calculation , which is known to play a crucial role in these systems @xcite and does not enter in leading - order contributions @xcite .    in recent years , a number of new avenues have opened to study hypernuclei with increased accuracy . of particular interest to this work",
    "are @xmath5-ray coincidence and @xmath6 experiments .",
    "recent @xmath5-ray experiments have measured the fine structure of a number of light hypernuclei @xcite , including the measurement of the ground - state particle - hole splitting in @xmath7o .",
    "high precision @xmath6 experiments have measured , or are set to measure , a number of similar states in light hypernuclei @xcite , including the ground - states of @xmath8b and @xmath7n . unfortunately , most of the states that have been measured with these techniques thus far lie below the range of @xmath9 accessible to the kohn - sham approach used in this work ; therefore , the experimental constraints on heavier hypernuclei are confined to upper bounds provided by @xmath10 reactions @xcite .",
    "it is this region of medium to heavy single @xmath0-hypernuclei that this work seeks to investigate .",
    "a number of recent calculations have tackled this problem .",
    "shell model calculations in p - shell hypernuclei were conducted using two - body matrix elements , accurately describing the known data @xcite .",
    "the influence of zero - range effective @xmath0nn interactions on p - shell hypernuclei has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "another model of interest uses strangeness changing response functions to calculate the spectra of @xmath11o and @xmath12ca ; the resulting ground - state particle - hole splittings are small @xcite .",
    "the spectra of @xmath7o has also been calculated from a folded diagram method using realistic hyperon - nucleon potentials @xcite .    in section [ sec",
    ": doub ] , we develop a method to calculate the particle - hole matrix elements of interest here",
    ". we then present the results of this analysis and make some conclusions in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "consider nuclei like @xmath7o ; the ground - states of such systems are , in fact , particle - hole states .",
    "one process by which nuclei of this type are created is the reaction @xmath10 on target nuclei with closed proton and neutron shells @xcite . during the course of this reaction a neutron",
    "is converted into a @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "a neutron hole is also created which , for the ground - state , inhabits the outermost neutron shell .",
    "the angular momentum of the @xmath0 and the neutron hole couple to form a multiplet .",
    "however , due to the fact that in the ground - state the @xmath0 occupies the @xmath14 shell , there are only two states in these multiplets .",
    "it is these configurations that we refer to as s@xmath15-doublets .",
    "the reaction @xmath6 is another process used to create nuclei of this type @xcite .",
    "this process differs in that a proton hole is created here and that greater resolution is possible .    in order to calculate the size of these splittings",
    ", we must first construct an effective interaction to model these systems .",
    "the procedure we follow here is similar to the method developed by machleidt and others @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the effective nn interaction is represented by the exchange of mesons ; then , a hierarchy of feynman diagrams depicting all the possible interactions is developed to reproduce the nn interaction .",
    "the contribution for a given diagram is just the product of the vertex contributions and the meson propagator , or @xmath16    where @xmath17 are the dirac free fields , @xmath18 is the meson propagator , and the vertex factors , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are taken directly from the underlying effective lagrangian through the relation @xmath21    where @xmath22 is some meson field operator .",
    "however , nuclei are comprised of bound nucleons and not free fields .",
    "therefore , in the present calculation , we improve on this system by replacing the free fields with the kohn - sham ( or hartree ) wave functions @xcite @xmath23    the contribution for any given diagram now takes the form ( following from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : int1 ] ) ) @xmath24    where we now define the effective interaction in momentum space as @xmath25    and @xmath26 .",
    "the meson propagators relevant to this analysis are ( here the conventions of @xcite are used )",
    "@xmath27    the second term in the vector meson propagator vanishes in any calculation due to conservation of the baryon current ( as a result , it is henceforth neglected ) .",
    "the relevant nucleon vertex factors are @xmath28    ( note that the @xmath0 vertex factors are equivalent to their nucleon counterparts except for the coupling constants @xcite . ) now a series of diagrams can be written down to represent the nn interaction , each of which will contribute to this effective interaction in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : har2 ] ) .",
    "once a fourier transform is performed on the effective interaction , it can be used to calculate the two - body matrix elements that govern the particle - hole interactions of interest here .",
    "now let us return to the case of single @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "the effective @xmath0n interaction is determined via the method outlined above and follows directly from our underlying effective lagrangian ( see @xcite ) . in this case , no single isovector meson coupling is allowed ; as a result , we confine the following discussion to isoscalar , scalar and vector , exchange . as a first approximation",
    ", we include only the leading - order contributions arising from contact vertices ; this corresponds to simple scalar and neutral vector couplings . to acquire each portion of the effective interaction ,",
    "we simply take the product of the nucleon vertex factor , the meson propagator , and the @xmath0 vertex factor .",

    "next we take the fourier transform of eqs .",

    "the effective interaction to this order was used in calculations conducted in @xcite ; unfortunately , it proved inadequate to fully describe the ground - state splittings in single @xmath0-hypernuclei . as it turns out , the effective interaction to this order includes only the spin - spin force .",
    "however , this neglects the fact that the tensor force is known to play a crucial role in these systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the natural extension of this approach is to include the higher - order contributions involving tensor couplings and thereby incorporate the tensor force into the calculation .",

    "the form of the effective interaction used here follows directly from the underlying lagrangian .",
    "note that this formulation of the problem contains no free parameters .",
    "retaining only the leading - order interaction terms , this calculation was conducted in @xcite ; this level of truncation in the residual interaction was inadequate to describe either the doublet size or level ordering in the ground - state of @xmath7o . to improve on this calculation ,",
    "we included in this effective interaction the contributions that contained gradient couplings to the neutral vector field ; this incorporated a tensor force into the calculation known to play a crucial role in these systems that did not appear at leading - order .",
    "cancellation occurs for the states that satisfy @xmath100 , flipping the sign from the simple leading - order spin - spin interaction .",
    "however , the contributions are additive for the states satisfying @xmath101 , resulting in splittings that lie outside the known experimental error bars .",
    "it turns out that the integrals are dominated by short - distance physics ; as a result , a cutoff was introduced to reduce this contribution .",
    "this cutoff did not effect the level orderings of any state ; it did however , reduce the size of the splittings for states with @xmath101 to within the experimental constraints while simultaneously retaining the cancellation the yielded small splittings in the states @xmath100 .",
