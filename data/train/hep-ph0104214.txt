    "usually the picture for the formation of galactic magnetic fields is related to the possibility of implementing the dynamo mechanism .",
    "the galaxy rotates with a typical period of @xmath259 yrs @xcite . by comparing the rotation period with the age of the galaxy ( for a universe with @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) the number of rotations performed by the galaxy since its origin is approximately @xmath263 . during these @xmath263 rotations the dynamo term of eq .",
    "( [ mdiff ] ) dominates against the magnetic diffusivity term since parity is globally broken over the physical size of the galaxy . as a consequence an instability develops",
    "this instability can be used in order to drive the magnetic field from some small initial condition up to its observed value .",
    "most of the work in the context of the dynamo theory focuses on reproducing the correct features of the magnetic field of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "for instance one could ask the dynamo codes to reproduce the specific ratio between the poloidal and toroidal amplitudes of the magnetic field of the milky way .    in spite of these aspects ,",
    "if the number of rotations of the galaxy is approximately @xmath263 , the achievable amplification produced by the dynamo instability can be at most of @xmath264 , i.e. @xmath265 .",
    "thus , if the present value of the galactic magnetic field is @xmath266 gauss , its value right after the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy might have been as small as @xmath267 gauss over a typical scale of @xmath263@xmath1 kpc .    there is a simple way to relate the value of the magnetic fields right after gravitational collapse to the value of the magnetic field right before gravitational collapse . since the gravitational collapse occurs at high conductivity the magnetic flux and the magnetic helicity",
    "are both conserved .",
    "right before the formation of the galaxy a patch of matter of roughly @xmath268 mpc collapses by gravitational instability .",
    "right before the collapse the mean energy density of the patch , stored in matter , is of the order of the critical density of the universe .",
    "right after collapse the mean matter density of the protogalaxy is , approximately , six orders of magnitude larger than the critical density .",
    "since the physical size of the patch decreases from @xmath268 mpc to @xmath263 kpc the magnetic field increases , because of flux conservation , of a factor @xmath269 where @xmath270 and @xmath271 are , respectively the energy densities right after and right before gravitational collapse . henceforth , the correct initial condition in order to turn on the dynamo instability is @xmath272 gauss over a scale of @xmath268 mpc , right before gravitational collapse .",
    "since the flux is conserved the ratio between the physical magnetic energy density and the energy density sitting in radiation is almost constant and therefore , in terms of this quantity ( which is only scale dependent but not time dependent ) , the dynamo requirement can be rephrased as @xmath273 if the dynamo is not invoked but the galactic magnetic field directly generated through some mechanism the correct value to impose at the onset of gravitational collapse is @xmath274 clearly even the number given in eq .",
