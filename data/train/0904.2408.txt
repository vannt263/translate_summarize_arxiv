    "photoassociation spectroscopy with continuous - wave ( cw ) lasers is sensitive to the position of the nodes of the scattering wave function describing two colliding atoms @xcite .",

    "this can be achieved by interaction with an external field which is fast relative to the ensuing dynamics .",
    "therefore the short - pulse photoassociation scenario  @xcite can be employed to generate a non - stationary initial state by a pump pulse and then follow its dynamics by a probe pulse  @xcite . the idea , sketched in fig .",

    "this would result in the dynamical hole being smeared over a large range of distances , hampering precise control of the hole location .",

    "the motion of the ground state density toward the inner turning point followed by the refilling of the hole is reflected in the peak of the signal which occurs , depending on the pump pulse energy , between 840@xmath6ps and 1100@xmath6ps for @xmath92@xmath77 , between 480@xmath6ps and 540@xmath6ps for @xmath94@xmath77 , and between 100@xmath6ps and 110@xmath6ps for @xmath96@xmath77 .",
    "the refilling of the hole corresponds to the recovery of the bleach known from molecular pump - probe spectroscopy . unlike those examples from gas - phase or condensed - phase dynamics , the signal in our case is not caused by vibronic motion of molecules but rather by the two - body correlations between atoms that are present in ultracold gases .",
    "the highest pump pulse energy always yields the fastest refilling .",
    "this is attributed to the momentum transfer which increases with pulse energy , cf .",
    "[ fig : afterpulse ] .",
    "after the initial refilling , another depletion is observed followed by a slow recovery with small oscillatory modulations of the signal . as in section  [ subsec : probe1 ] , a larger detuning of the pump pulse leads to a higher frequency of these oscillations .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations can be enhanced by increasing the pump pulse energy , in particular for large detunings .",
    "the strength of the probe signal without any pump pulse is given by the probability density amplitude at the condon radius .",
    "for larger detuning , the condon radius and hence the amplitude decrease , cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "this determines the strength of the background signal from which the recovery of the bleach is measured .",
    "it is decreased by an order of magnitude when increasing the pump pulse detuning from @xmath94@xmath77 to @xmath96@xmath77 ( cf .",
    "initial values in fig .",

    "it might seem a little surprising at first sight , that an enhancement of the signal _ above _ its background value is observed for strong field and large detuning , cf .",
    "blue solid curve in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : window3 ] .",
    "this implies that , at certain times , corresponding to pump - probe delays of e.g. 610@xmath6ps or 2300@xmath6ps , more probability density resides within the probe window than is initially there .",
    "one would rather expect that , after the initial refilling of the hole , when the hot atomic component of the ground state wave packet has left the short internuclear distances of the probe window , the signal could not be completely recovered anymore .",
    "this picture holds , however , only for weak pump pulses . for a pump pulse energy of 23@xmath6nj ,",
    "rabi cycling occurs , cf .",

    "it is accompanied by power broadening .",
    "a broadened pulse spectrum corresponds to addressing initial ground state density in a larger range of internuclear distances .",
    "therefore the 23@xmath6nj - pump pulse at a detuning of @xmath96@xmath77 excites not only the peak in the initial ground state wave function around @xmath97a@xmath34 but also part of the two neighboring peaks , cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "since some of this population is cycled back to the ground state , it may contribute to the bound components of the hole and show up in the long - term oscillations of the probe signal .",
    "the spectra of the probe signals are examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : specwindow3 ] .",
    "the highest peaks occur at the position of the last bound levels of the ground state potential that are indicated by the black arrows .",
    "the peak around zero is due to the last level which is not resolved on the shown frequency scales ( @xmath98@xmath77 or 25 mhz ) .",
    "it is off the top of the figure in the upper two panels for the smaller pump pulse detunings but reduced in the lower panel for the large pump pulse detuning .",
    "this is in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : vibdistg ] where for the larger detuning a smaller population of the last bound level is observed .",
    "the smaller peaks occurring at higher frequencies are attributed to beat frequencies between different vibrational levels , some of which are indicated by the gray arrows . increasing the pump pulse energy leads to larger peaks and a finer resolution of the spectral features , in particular for the larger pump pulse detuning .",
    "a larger detuning of the pump pulse implies larger components in the ground state wave packet with binding energies above @xmath99@xmath77 , cf .",

    "a hole in the pair density of an ultracold gas is the consequence of sudden unitary population transfer from the ground to the excited electronic state .",
    "it represents a non - stationary state of the two - atom scattering whose evolution in time can be monitored by a suitably chosen probe pulse .",
    "such a pump - probe spectroscopy of pair correlations can be implemented by slight modification of existing experimental setups @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to bose - einstein condensates as well as thermal ultracold gases .",
    "this corresponds to studying the dynamics of a pure state vs those of an incoherent ensemble for the timescales probed in such an experiment .",
    "the main effect of thermal averaging is the contribution of higher partial waves .",
    "this is particularly prominent in the presence of resonances @xcite .",
    "if a resonance affects different scattering channels differently , such as shape resonances in either the singlet or the triplet channel of rubidium , pump - probe spectroscopy can be used to map out the coupled channels pair wavefunction despite the finite lifetime of the resonance @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the influence of the pulse parameters on the hole dynamics for a pure initial state .",
    "creation of a hole can be induced by a short pulse which is faster than the timescale of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "a practical requirement is that this pulse should be transparent at the atomic transition . in that case",
    ", only pair correlations are dynamically modified .",
    "the pulse has to be impulsive compared to the timescale of relative motion on the electronic ground state . for ultracold rubidium",
    ", the pulse duration should be a few picoseconds or , respectively , the spectral bandwidth a few wavenumbers .",
    "the same process could be applied to other species with the timescale modified to maintain the impulsive condition .",
    "the hole represents a non - stationary superposition of many scattering states and a few of the last bound levels .",
    "the shape of the hole in phase space , i.e. its momentum and the position , are controlled by the pulse intensity , chirp and detuning from the atomic line . as a result there is significant experimental flexibility to interrogate specific properties of the pair correlation .",
    "the timescale of the dynamics of the hole can be estimated by comparing the acceleration due to the difference potential and the energy associated to the bandwidth of the pulse .",
    "an upper bound of the transform - limited pulse duration is related to the gain in kinetic energy due to the gradient of the difference potential .",
    "a lower bound is imposed by the restriction not to excite the atomic resonance . for all hole positions of interest , this defines a window of possible transform - limited pulse durations which for rubidium are of the order of a few picoseconds to tens of picoseconds .    to monitor the dynamical evolution of the hole ,",
    "a second weak pulse , delayed in time from the pump pulse , is applied as a probe .",
    "typically the number of pairs is small which means a high sensitivity is required . in this",
    "study a two - photon rempi scheme is suggested .",
    "the probe pulse transfers amplitude to an intermediate state which then is ionized leading to a high detection efficiency .",
    "we have modeled the absorption of the probe pulse by time - dependent perturbation theory applied to the first step .",
    "this assumes saturation of the second step in the rempi scheme .",
    "the characteristics of the probe pulse duration , chirp and central frequency determines the properties of the measurement .    probing the two - body correlation dynamics yields a signal with clear dynamical features . if one is able to provide for pump - probe delays of a few nanoseconds , spectral features on a scale of less than @xmath100@xmath77 can be resolved . since pump and probe just address probability density at certain internuclear distances , no phase relation between the pulses is required , and long time delays between the pump and probe pulse can be realized by optical delay stages .    the full power of coherent control can be employed to modify the hole .",
    "the simplest modification makes use of chirped pulses . chirping the pump pulse changes the shape of the hole , while chirping the probe pulse generates a measurement of position and momentum in phase space with accuracy limited by the uncertainty relation .",
    "this pump - probe spectroscopy of the pair correlation dynamics can be combined with static external field control of the initial pair density .",
    "specifically , tuning a magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance enhances the pair density at short and intermediate distances @xcite .",
    "obviously , this will lead to a larger probe signal strength .",
    "it remains an interesting open problem to study the effect of the feshbach resonance on the dynamical properties .",
