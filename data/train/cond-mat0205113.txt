    "violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation ( c ) and parity ( p ) has been discovered in the decay of the @xmath2 meson about 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the exact origin of this symmetry violation remains an enigma , although the so called standard model of electroweak interactions can describe these processes phenomenologically .",
    "it has also been proposed by sakharov @xcite that the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe could have arisen from a cp - violating interaction active at an early stage of the big bang . the cp - violation implies a time - reversal ( t ) asymmetry and hence violation of both t- and p - symmetries , because there are strong reasons to believe that the combined cpt - symmetry should not be violated @xcite .",
    "electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a system in a stationary quantum state indicates violation of t- and p - symmetries .",
    "this is why searches for edm of elementary particles , atoms and molecules are very important for studies of violations of fundamental symmetries @xcite .",
    "a property that is closely related to edm is the so called schiff moment , see e.g. ref .",
    "a non zero schiff moment also indicates t- and p - violation . in the present paper we consider t , p - odd effects in solids due to the edm of the electron and due to the nuclear schiff moment .",
    "the present best limitation on the electron edm comes from the berkeley experiment with an atomic thallium beam @xcite , @xmath3 there are some ideas for improvement of the sensitivity .",
    "one way of improvement is an experiment with metastable levels of pbo molecules @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough could be achieved in solid state experiments with compounds containing uncompensated spins .",
    "this idea was suggested by shapiro in 1968 @xcite .",
    "application of a strong electric field to electrons bound within a solid would align the edms of these electrons .",
    "this should lead to a simultaneous alignment of the electron spins ; the magnetic field arising from this alignment could be detected experimentally .",
    "another possibility is to polarize electrons by the external magnetic field .",
    "this causes alignment of electron edms , and hence induces a voltage across the sample that could be detected .",
    "an experiment of this kind has been performed with nickel - zinc ferrite @xcite .",
    "however due to experimental limitations the result was not very impressive .",
    "interest in this approach has been renewed recently due to a suggestion of lamoreaux @xcite and hunter @xcite to perform similar experiments with gadolinium gallium garnet , gd@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ggg ) , and gadolinium iron garnet gd@xmath4fe@xmath5o@xmath6 ( gdig ) employing new experimental techniques .",
    "the estimates of sensitivity look highly promising . in the present work",
    "we calculate the expected effects .",
    "the best limitation on the nuclear schiff moment ( nsm ) comes from the seattle experiment with atomic @xmath7hg @xcite , @xmath8 the expected value of @xmath9 expressed in terms of the fundamental cp - violating interaction depends on the structure of the particular nucleus , however for heavy nuclei this dependence is not that strong and therefore we will take the value ( [ hg ] ) as a reference point .",
    "later , we will comment on a possible additional enhancement due to a special structure of the @xmath10gd nucleus .",
    "one can search for nsm in the experiments with ggg and gdig simultaneously with searches for the electron edm .",
    "the point is that due to the hyperfine interaction nuclear polarization causes polarization of electrons and vice versa .",
    "another possibility is to use a compound without unpaired electrons , for example lutetium gallium garnet , lu@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 or lutetium oxide lu@xmath11o@xmath4 .",
    "in this case one can cool the nuclear spin subsystem down to very low temperature @xcite and this gives an additional enhancement of the effect . in the present work",
    "we calculate the coefficient of proportionality between voltage and nuclear polarization due to nsm .",
    "structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we present simple estimates of the effects induced by the electron edm .",
    "section iii contains derivation of the effective interaction induced by the electron edm .",
    "the gd@xmath0 octupole moment is also discussed here . in section",
    "iv we calculate wave functions of oxygen electrons penetrating inside the gd@xmath0 core .",
    "section v presents derivation of the effective hamiltonian which relates the electron edm with deformation of the lattice . in sections vi and vii we derive final results for the voltage across the sample and the energy shift in the external electric field induced by the electron edm .",
    "section viii presents similar results for effects induced by the gd nuclear schiff moment .",
    "finally sections ix and x contain estimates of accuracy of the calculations and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we follow simple and important estimates performed in ref .",
    "gdig is an ionic crystal consisting of gd@xmath0 , fe@xmath0 and o@xmath1 ions , see ref .",
    "uncompensated electronic spins are localized at gd@xmath0 which has a @xmath12 electronic configuration and fe@xmath0 which has a @xmath13 electronic configuration .",
    "both these ions have half - filled electronic shells , hence the orbital angular momenta of these shells are zero .",
    "this explains a very weak spin anisotropy in this compound .",
    "if the electron edm is not zero , then both gd@xmath0 and fe@xmath0 have induced edms proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that the coefficient @xmath16 scales as @xmath17 , where z is the nuclear charge , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore we neglect the edm of fe@xmath0 and consider only gd@xmath0 .",
    "ggg differs from gdig in the replacement of magnetic fe@xmath0 by nonmagnetic ga@xmath0 ions .",
    "the most important gd@xmath0 ion is exactly the same .",
    "the enhancement coefficient for gd@xmath0 has been calculated previously @xcite @xmath18 if all the uncompensated spins in the sample are 100% polarized then the induced electric field in the sample is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number density of gd .",
    "this gives the following induced voltage across an @xmath21 sample @xmath22 this numerical estimate corresponds to the current limitation on @xmath14 , see ( [ tl ] ) and would be absolutely correct for a crystal consisting of neutral atoms or molecules .",
    "however the charge of gd@xmath0 is not zero .",
    "hence the average electric field acting on the ion must be equal to zero , and hence the edm of the ion can not really produce the field ( [ naive ] ) .",
    "this means that the crystal lattice relaxes in such a way that the effect ( [ naive ] ) is canceled out .",
    "this is the schiff theorem @xcite .",
    "the theorem is violated due to the finite size of the ion .",
    "it means that the estimate ( [ naive ] ) should be reduced by some factor depending on the ratio of the ion size to the lattice spacing .",
    "calculation of this effect is performed in the following sections .    on",
    "can also perform an estimate of the resulting magnetization due to an applied electric field @xmath23 to the sample .",
    "the field inside the solid is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dielectric constant ( for gdig @xmath26 , and for ggg @xmath27 see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the t , p - odd energy shift per gd ion is given by , @xmath28 the numerical estimate corresponds to the current limitation on @xmath14 , see ( [ tl ] ) and @xmath29 .",
    "using boltzmann distribution one can deduce the resulting magnetization of the medium .",
    "similar to ( [ naive ] ) the estimate ( [ n2 ] ) contradicts the schiff theorem .",
    "an accurate calculation of @xmath30 is performed below .",
    "in this section we follow the method of calculation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath31 be the electric potential produced by the environment of a particular gd@xmath0 ion , @xmath32 is the charge density of surrounding ions and @xmath33 is the electric field produced by distant ions and external sources .",
    "the energy correction for a system which has a non - zero edm is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the correction to the charge density of gd@xmath0 due to the t , p - odd interaction @xmath36 .    in equilibrium the average force acting on gd@xmath0 vanishes",
    ", @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the spherically symmetric charge density of gd@xmath0 normalized by the condition @xmath39 .",
    "the total charge density of gd@xmath0 is given by @xmath40 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) and assuming that @xmath33 is uniform in the vicinity of gd@xmath0 one can rewrite the energy correction as @xmath41    the charge density correction @xmath35 can be expanded in a series of spherical harmonics , @xmath42 where @xmath43 here we denote the argument of @xmath44 by @xmath45 to distinguish it from the internal variable @xmath46 in the matrix elements . because of the negative parity of @xmath36 only odd @xmath47 contribute to ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "the @xmath48 terms correspond to the edm of gd@xmath0 , and @xmath49 to its octupole moment .",
    "first we demonstrate that the octupole and all higher moments vanish for gd@xmath0 if one neglects the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the kinematic structure of the t , p - odd hamiltonian is , see , e.g. @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spin and the position of the electron , and @xmath53 .",
    "an intermediate state @xmath54 in ( [ f6 ] ) belongs to some electronic configuration .",
    "we denote the configuration by @xmath55 .",
    "the states within the configuration we numerate by an index @xmath56 , so @xmath57 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath58 the average energy of the configuration . in eq.([f6 ] ) we first perform summation over @xmath56 and then over @xmath55 . with account of ( [ hk ] )",
    "this gives @xmath59 here we have used the closure relation @xmath60 , where 1 acts in the spin - angular space .",
    "this relation is valid because of the separation of variables in the problem . without the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "the ground state of gd@xmath0 reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the s - wave orbital state ( half filled shell ) .",
    "hence we get from ( [ flm ] ) @xmath63 it is clear that this equation gives zero for any @xmath47 higher than 1 because one can combine @xmath64 with @xmath65 into total angular momentum zero only at @xmath66 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction @xmath67 admixes states with nonzero @xmath68 to the ground state of gd@xmath0 .",
    "the interaction contains the first power of orbital angular momentum @xmath69 , so each order of the perturbation theory in the interaction changes the selection rule by @xmath70 .",
    "hence , to get a nonzero octupole moment of gd@xmath0 one has to go to the second order in the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this is a very small effect and we do not consider it .",
    "now we return to the energy correction ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "expanding @xmath71 in a series of spherical harmonics @xmath72 and keeping in mind that according to the previous discussion @xmath73 contains only the first harmonic , we transform the energy correction ( [ f4 ] ) to the following form @xmath74\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula is similar to the standard one for the schiff moment contribution to the t , p - odd energy correction , see refs .",
    "@xcite . for a smooth function @xmath75 the eq . ( [ f7 ] ) can be easily transformed to the standard form .",
    "however the point is that in the present case the density @xmath75 is not a smooth function of @xmath45 .",
    "similar to the standard case , eq .",
    "( [ f7 ] ) gives zero @xmath76 if the external charge @xmath75 is localized outside of the gd@xmath0 core .",
    "so we have to calculate the probability for external electrons to penetrate inside the gd@xmath0 core .",
    "this calculation is performed in the following section .",
    "considering the integral over @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ f7 ] ) , we deduce that only an asymmetric part in @xmath78 proportional to @xmath79 can contribute to the energy correction .",
    "there is no such term for the lattice without deformation .",
    "hence the nonzero @xmath76 is also related to the deformation of the lattice .",
    "in the garnet structure any gd@xmath0 ion is surrounded by eight o@xmath1 ions organized in a dodecahedron structure ( slightly distorted cube ) @xcite . for the calculation",
    "we approximate this structure by a cube with gd@xmath0 in the middle .",
    "the gd - o distance used is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the bohr radius . in the case of gdig",
    "there are also uncompensated spins localized at fe@xmath0 ions .",
    "however the t , p - odd effect scales as @xmath17 , and therefore the contribution of fe is negligible compared to that of gd .",
    "an additional reason for suppression of the fe contribution is that the crystal radius of fe@xmath0 is much smaller than that of gd@xmath0 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the charge density of external electrons @xmath82 inside the gd@xmath0 ion .",
    "the electrons are coming from the eight nearest o@xmath1 ions .",
    "the o@xmath1 ion has a closed shell configuration , with 3 double occupied 2p - orbitals .",
    "one can show that @xmath83 orbitals do not contribute to the effects we are interested in .",
    "so we only consider @xmath84-orbitals pointing towards gd@xmath0 as schematically shown in the 2-dimensional picture in fig .",
    "hence there are 16 electrons that can potentially penetrate inside gd@xmath0 .",
    "first of all let us rewrite the eight @xmath84-orbitals in the basis with definite symmetry with respect to the cubic structure .",
    "the new basis reads @xmath85 here , for example @xmath86 denotes the @xmath84-orbital of the first oxygen .",
    "the ions are numbered as in fig .",
    "all of the states  ( [ f10 ] ) are doubly occupied .",
    "as long as the electron is moving near the oxygen ion the electron wave function can be described as a @xmath84-orbital .",
    "however when the electron approaches the gd@xmath0 ion its wave function is strongly deformed by the potential of gd@xmath0 . to describe this effect we draw an imaginary sphere of radius @xmath87 around the gd@xmath0 ion as shown in fig .",
    "we assume that outside the sphere the oxygen potential dominates and the wave is described as one of the ( [ f10 ] ) orbitals .",
    "however inside the sphere the gd@xmath0 potential dominates and hence the same orbital is described as s- , p- , d- , or f - orbital of gd .",
    "we are interested only in s- and p- orbitals that correspond to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 states from ( [ f10 ] ) . at @xmath92",
    "we will use the 6s and 6p orbitals of gd@xmath93 as the basis .",
    "we can also choose 7s and 7p or 8s and 8p , the final result is independent of the choice because at @xmath92 all these wave functions are proportional to each other .",
    "thus at @xmath92 , we get @xmath94 to find the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 we match ( [ f11 ] ) with ( [ f10 ] ) at the surface of the sphere with radius @xmath97 using the following projection @xmath98 hence @xmath99 this is a simple and reliable method to calculate the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "it has been previously used for calculation of the nuclear quadrupole resonance frequencies in la@xmath11cuo@xmath100 , see ref . @xcite . in that case",
    "the accuracy of the method was verified by experimental data and proved to be @xmath10110% .",
    "for numerical calculations with ( [ f12]),([f13 ] ) we have used 2p - wave - functions of o@xmath1 calculated previously in @xcite .",
    "the 6s and 6p wave functions of gd@xmath93 have been obtained by the relativistic hartree - fock method for configuration @xmath102 . in this calculation",
    "we average over polarizations of the unclosed shells .",
    "it means that @xmath12 is taken as @xmath103 with 50% population of each orbital , similarly 6s is taken as @xmath104 with 50% population and 6p is taken as @xmath105 with 1/6=16.6% population .",
    "there is also the fine structure effect : the difference between @xmath106 and @xmath107 states .",
    "however this effect is small and has been neglected in the calculation of @xmath96 .",
    "the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 calculated with ( [ f12]),([f13 ] ) for different choices of the matching radius @xmath87 are presented in table 1 .",

    "this can be true only if the total probability for an oxygen electron to penetrate inside the matching sphere , @xmath92 , is small . to check this we calculate the probabilities @xmath114 numerical values of @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    "are presented in table 1 , they are really very small . the average number of oxygen electrons penetrating inside the matching sphere , @xmath117 listed in table 1 is also rather small .",
    "thus , the external charge density with respect to gd@xmath0 inside the matching sphere is given by @xmath118 the coefficient 2 is due to the double occupancy ( spin up , down ) of each orbital .",
    "it has been pointed out in the previous section that the charge density ( [ f16 ] ) is insufficient to generate a t , p - odd effect because @xmath119 is symmetric with respect to reflection @xmath120 . to have an asymmetric part @xmath121 one needs to consider a deformation of the lattice .",
    "we will assume that gd is shifted along the z - axis with respect to the environment by a small displacement x , for definition of axes see fig .",
    "the displacement is shown schematically in the 2-dimensional picture in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the general case",
    "the displacement can have an arbitrary direction .",

    "( [ ddee ] ) . this can be measured via macroscopic magnetization of the sample .",

    "both the nmr and the macroscopic magnetization techniques can be used . a possibility to cool the nuclear spin subsystem down to very low temperatures",
    "@xcite can give an additional advantage .    in our estimates of the effects induced by nsm",
