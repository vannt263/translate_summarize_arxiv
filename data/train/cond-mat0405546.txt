    "low - dimensional physics has attracted a great interest of theoretical and experimental physicists for almost a half century  @xcite . among them , the bethe ansatz method , which was originally developed as a non - perturbative method for diagonalizing one - dimensional spin-@xmath4 isotropic heisenberg spin chain  @xcite , opened a new realm of mathematical physics .",
    "roughly speaking , bethe s work consists of three parts : i ) bethe states are introduced and bethe equations , which are sufficient conditions for the bethe states being eigenstates , are derived ; ii ) the existence of solutions for the bethe equations are discussed in simple cases , and the general forms of solutions are conjectured , which are called string hypothesis ; iii ) under the string hypothesis , the formula for counting the number of the bethe states is provided , which leads to the combinatorial completeness of bethe ansatz . at present the bethe ansatz method is applied to various kinds of one - dimensional spin chains and strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite .    in bethe",
    "s work , the combinatorial formula for counting the number of bethe states possesses a wealth of mathematical implications . in the case of the isotropic heisenberg spin chain",
    ", the bethe states constructed by finite - valued solutions of bethe equations do not produce all the eigenstates .",
    "in fact the system has @xmath2 symmetry and the bethe states are @xmath2-highest  @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates other than highest weight vectors , i.e. , @xmath2-descendant states , are constructed by applying the lowering operator to the bethe states .",
    "mathematically , the number of bethe states is interpreted as the multiplicity of irreducible components in the tensor products of two - dimensional highest weight @xmath2-modules .",
    "bethe s formula is also extended to the generalized heisenberg spin chains with higher spins or @xmath5 symmetry , for which the powerful tools such as @xmath6-systems are introduced  @xcite .",
    "the application of bethe ansatz method to the one - dimensional hubbard model was given by lieb and wu  @xcite .",
    "the bethe equations for the hubbard model are often called lieb - wu equations .",
    "takahashi s string hypothesis asserts that , in the thermodynamic limit , the solutions of lieb - wu equations are approximated by string solutions , and the number of bethe states is estimated under the hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model with even sites has @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "essler , korepin and schoutens proved that , when the system has the @xmath0 symmetry , the bethe states are @xmath0-highest  @xcite .",
    "they also showed in a combinatorial way that all the eigenstates are obtained by taking the @xmath0-descendants of the bethe states into account  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the completeness of bethe ansatz for the system with odd sites , which has just @xmath2 symmetry related to the spin degrees of freedom , has not been discussed .    in this article , we study the bethe states in the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "in particular , we deal with the system on a ring with aharonov - bohm - type magnetic flux .",
    "the system has @xmath0 symmetry only at special values of the ab - flux strength and the @xmath0 symmetry reduces to spin-@xmath2 symmetry for other values .",
    "more precisely , for a generic value of the ab - flux strength , the @xmath0 symmetry breaks into the direct sum of the charge-@xmath1 and the spin-@xmath2 symmetry . varying the ab - flux strength , we investigate solutions of lieb - wu equations . here",
    "we recall that all the enumeration of bethe states we have mentioned above are based on the string hypothesis",
    ". however , the violation of the string hypothesis is numerically observed : for the spin-@xmath4 isotropic heisenberg spin chain , some of the string solutions reduce to real solutions when the number of sites is large , which is called redistribution phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "thus , without making any approximation , we discuss the existence of bethe ansatz solutions with the ab - flux .",
    "in particular , we show the existence of solutions of the lieb - wu equations with an arbitrary number of up - spins and one down - spin . here",
    "we employ a graphical approach  @xcite .",
    "we exactly count the number of solutions in the case and verify that the enumeration with the string hypothesis is correct only in the @xmath0-case .",
    "we find that the lieb - wu equations for the system with only the spin-@xmath2 symmetry have more solutions than those in the @xmath0-case .",
    "next we study the combinatorial completeness of bethe ansatz .",
    "we obtain the relation among the characters of @xmath0-modules through the power series identities similar to kirillov s  @xcite , which gives a new proof of essler - korepin - schoutens combinatorial completeness of bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a new combinatorial formula derived from the relation among the characters of @xmath3-modules .",
    "the formula suggests the combinatorial completeness of bethe ansatz for the system only with the spin-@xmath2 symmetry , which has not been discussed in the literature",
    ".    the bethe ansatz solutions with the ab - flux should be quite important in the low - dimensional physics of the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "as pointed out by kohn , the low frequency conductivity is directly related to the shift of the energy levels due to twisted boundary conditions  @xcite . sharpening kohn s",
    "argument on electron systems in any dimensions , shastry and sutherland discussed effective mass of the one - dimensional hubbard model through the twisted boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kawakami and yang obtained an explicit expression for the effective mass of the electric conductivity for the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "for the bethe ansatz solutions with the twisted boundary conditions , there are other aspects such as persistent current associated with the ab - flux .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : symmetry - bethe ] , we review the symmetry of the one - dimensional hubbard model and the bethe ansatz method .",
    "we also describe how to construct eigenstates other than the bethe states . in section  [ sec : lw - eq_one - down ] we prove the existence of solutions for the lieb - wu equations with one down - spin and exactly count the number of bethe states in varying the strength of ab - flux . in section  [ sec : characters ] we study the combinatorial formulas for counting the bethe states in terms of the characters of @xmath0- and @xmath3-modules .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we introduce the hubbard model on an @xmath7-site ring with aharonov - bohm - type magnetic flux @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the creation and annihilation operators of electrons satisfying @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and define the number operators by @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the fock space @xmath14 of electrons with the vacuum state @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the one - dimensional hubbard model is described by the following hamiltonian acting on @xmath14 : @xmath17 where we assume @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore @xmath21 has the same energy spectra as those of @xmath22 .",

    "given a set of spin configuration @xmath30 with @xmath31 up - spins and @xmath26 down - spins , the bethe state with @xmath32 has the following form : @xmath33 the coefficients @xmath34 in are explicitly given in  @xcite .",
    "the bethe states   are eigenstates of the hamiltonian   if @xmath32 satisfy the following equations : @xmath35 which are coupled nonlinear equations called lieb - wu equations  @xcite .",
    "the lieb - wu equations have not been solved analytically .",
    "however it predicts some important results on thermodynamic properties of the system through takahashi s string hypothesis  @xcite . in terms of the solutions",
    "@xmath32 of the lieb - wu equations  , energy eigenvalues are written as @xmath36 recall that the bethe states   give only the eigenstates with @xmath27 . in order to construct other eigenstates",

    "hereafter we shall sometimes abbreviate the superscript @xmath23 in @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38-independent symmetries of the hubbard model are classified in @xcite .",
    "first we review the symmetries connected with the spin and charge degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "define the following operators related to the spin degrees of freedom : @xmath39 they give a representation of the algebra @xmath2 on the fock space @xmath14 .",
    "since all the operators @xmath40 commute with @xmath21   for an arbitrary value of @xmath23 , it is said that the system has spin-@xmath2 symmetry .",
    "one finds another representation of @xmath2 related to the charge degrees of freedom , @xmath41 note that all the operators in are commutative with @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to see that the operator @xmath42 also commutes with @xmath21 for an arbitrary value of @xmath23 .",
    "however other operators @xmath43 commute with @xmath21 only for the special values of @xmath23 satisfying @xmath44 .",
    "thus the system has charge-@xmath2 symmetry if @xmath44 , and it reduces to charge-@xmath1 symmetry given by @xmath42 for other values of @xmath23 . combining the above two kinds of @xmath2 symmetries , we see that the system has @xmath45 symmetry if @xmath44 , and @xmath46 symmetry otherwise . for simplicity ,",
    "we call the former @xmath0-case and the latter @xmath2-case . for the later discussion",
    ", we define the casimir operators for each @xmath2 , @xmath47 which are employed to see the dimension of each representation .",
    "next we introduce the following three operators : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denotes the greatest integer in @xmath51 .",

    "we recall that the ab - flux parameter @xmath23 takes a special value : @xmath44 for even or odd @xmath7 .",
    "then , as shown in  @xcite for even @xmath7 with @xmath59 , the bethe states   characterized by finite - valued solutions of the lieb - wu equations   are @xmath0-highest , i.e. , @xmath60 .",

    "such eigenstates with @xmath76 are constructed as follows : i ) by applying the transformation @xmath58 to the bethe state @xmath77 if @xmath7 is even , or by applying @xmath73 to the bethe state @xmath78 obtained by the lieb - wu equations   with @xmath79 instead of @xmath23 if @xmath7 is odd , we get the lowest weight vector of a highest weight @xmath2-module ; ii ) the application of the raising operators @xmath80 to the lowest weight vector produces other degenerate eigenstates .",
    "even if we are interested only in the system with @xmath59 , the bethe ansatz method needs the system with @xmath81 for odd @xmath7 .",

    "by employing a graphical approach , we exactly count the number of finite - valued solutions for the lieb - wu equations   in the case when the system contains an arbitrary number of up - spins and one down - spin , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
