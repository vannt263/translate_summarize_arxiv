    "figure 1(b ) in the main text can be taken as a reference for the energy level scheme employed by dorfman _",
    "et al._. in [ ] , the coherent interaction between the excited donor states [ @xmath11 and @xmath12 in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] is induced through the indirect process of fano - interference , which results from coupling the excited states to a common ` hot ' electromagnetic and ` cold ' phonon environment .",
    "the resulting dynamics of this cycle is rather more complicated than the one proposed in this paper , and requires the inclusion of coherence ( off - diagonal ) terms in the density matrix evolution .",
    "the fano interference induces population - to - coherence transfer , a phenomenon that also appears in non - secular bloch - redfield theory ( brt ) ; the fano master equation can also be derived by applying the non - secular brt to the light - matter interaction @xcite . however , the inclusion of non - secular terms in brt master equations is known to permit unphysical solutions for all system - reservoir interactions , other than pure dephasing  @xcite .",
    "these unphysical solutions appear as density matrices with negative eigenvalues , which can also manifest as negative populations for some states .",
    "furthermore , such violations are expected to increase with the strength of the non - secular interactions  @xcite .",
    "we have solved the quantum master equation reported in [ ] ( see eqs .",
    "s74-s79 in [ ] ) using the initial conditions and parameters specified in the paper . figures s3(a)-s3(c ) illustrate the time - evolution of both the populations of @xmath12 and @xmath10 ( @xmath175 and @xmath176 ) as well as the coherence between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath177 ) in the ` overdamped ' regime .",
    "figures s3(a ) and s3(c ) are in perfect agreement with those shown by dorfman _",
    "( see figs .",
    "3c-3d in [ ] ) .",
    "figure s3(b ) has been obtained calculating the dynamics at times larger than those shown in [ ] and clearly shows that the ` overdamped ' regime , in which dorfman _ et al .",
    "_ report the largest enhancement of photocurrent , is characterised by a steady state with a large , negative population in the @xmath12 state .",
    "this regime corresponds to the limit where the driving of the coherence due to coherence - to - population transfer terms is strong , and comparable to the free oscillation frequency of the coherence .",
    "interestingly , for intermediate coupling a more modest enhancement is found , but the steady state , which also possesses stead oscillatory coherence [ see fig .",
    "s3(e ) ] , does remain positive .",
    "moreover , on going deeper into this regime , reducing the energy difference between the donor energy levels , we find that the master equation reported in [ ] is unstable and the individual populations may diverge , although their sum always remains unity due to the negative populations .",
    "this is exemplified by fig .",
    "s4 , which shows the steady - state solutions for the @xmath12 and @xmath14 populations as a function of the alignement factor of the photon dipole matrix element @xmath178 ( see e.g. [ ] ) . at maximum interference ,",
    "the fano - induced photonic coupling rate is given by @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "this is a rather subtle point of the model proposed by dorfman _",
    "et al . _ : in [ ] the authors do not introduce the alignment factor within their model and equations , and thus we assume that @xmath180 ; in other publications ( see e.g. [ ] ) the same authors use @xmath181 , @xmath182 being a small number , without any further clarification .",
    "however , fig .",
    "s4 clearly shows that as the energy spacing between the excited states ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 ) decreases , the density matrix element @xmath183 becomes negative for a wide range of values of the alignment factor @xmath178 and both @xmath183 and @xmath18 tend to diverge .    in light of this ,",
    "it is not clear if the enhancement of photocurrent induced by fano interference is a real feature of the proposed model or an artefact of the master equation used to simulate its dynamics ( which also neglects incoherent relaxation between the optical excited states ) . indeed , as pointed out by nalbach and thorwart in their commentary on [ ] , it is perhaps surprising that the enhancements of photocurrent and steady - state coherence oscillations only appear in the strongly damped regime  @xcite .",
    "all this suggests that this mechanism may lead to enhancement ( none is seen for weak coupling ) , but a more sophisticated , non - perturbative method of simulating the dynamics - starting with the microscopic interactions - should be used to assess such a claim .",
    "we note that recent numerically exact studies of exciton dynamics in ppcs have shown that population to coherence dynamics _ can _ arise when the phonon environment contains contributions from non - adiabatic coupling to underdamped vibrations  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that in [ ] , the qme has been solved assuming the system initially being in the coherent superposition state , i.e. using @xmath184 .",
    "these conditions do not characterise a system under incoherent excitation by incident sunlight , which should be described by a initially fully occupied ground state , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "we have solved the qme given in [ ] using this latter initial condition , and found that even in this case , the population of the @xmath12 state becomes negative almost immediately [ see fig .",
    "moreover , this pathology can be observed also in other regimes investigated by dorfman _",
    "et al._. figure s5(c ) , for instance , shows that negative values of the populations are obtained when solving the qme of [ ] in the ` intermediate regime ' under the conditions of incoherent excitation [ @xmath54 ] .         and",
