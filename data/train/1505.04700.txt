    "the crystal structure of even extremely stable molecular carbon compounds like co@xmath0 is known to transform radically at high pressures where , above @xmath450gpa , the carbon coordination is found , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite to switch from two in the molecular structure @xmath1 to four in the @xmath2-cristobalite structure .",
    "@xcite similar pressure - induced structural transformations can reasonably be expected to occur in a compound such as cs@xmath0 , which is the focus of the present study , and which presents obvious similarities to co@xmath0 indeed cs@xmath0 adopts at zero pressure the same @xmath1 molecular crystal structure as co@xmath0 at moderate pressures between 15 and 50 gpa .",
    "however , the binding in cs@xmath0 is much weaker than in co@xmath0 , with a smaller electronic band gap and a positive formation enthalpy of about 88.7kj / mol as opposed to a large negative one of @xmath5kj / mole for co@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite thermodynamically , that makes decomposition and phase separation into elementary carbon and sulfur a thermodynamic necessity for cs@xmath0 at equilibrium already at ambient pressure and presumably even more so at higher pressures . in spite of that intrinsic thermodynamical metastability , solid cs@xmath0 phases",
    "do exist , clearly for kinetic reasons , and are reported at ambient pressure not to decompose in measurable times , at least below @xmath6560k ,  @xcite a temperature rising even further at high pressures , possibly up to 1000k at 70gpa .",
    "@xcite at high pressures but low temperatures , x - ray data have shown evidence of structural transitions of cs@xmath0 from the molecular phase to polymeric phases with c  s coordinations rising from two ( _ cmca _ ) to three ( cs@xmath7 ) to four ( cs@xmath8),@xcite and further . with the exception of the cs@xmath7 phase near 20gpa , the high pressure structural behavior has been postulated so far to be similar to that of co@xmath0 , implying ( not unreasonably ) that cs@xmath8 could be @xmath2-cristobalite . in cs@xmath0 a detailed interpretation of high pressure experimental data is further complicated by a large amount of structural disorder , particularly in the cs@xmath8 phase where only broad rather than sharp bragg peaks are present in the diffraction pattern .",
    "@xcite with that rationalization of the fourfold coordinated state of cs@xmath0 near 50gpa through simple analogy with co@xmath0 , density functional theory ( dft ) studies have considered @xmath2-cristobalite ( @xmath9 , also referred to as chalcopyrite ) and tridymite ( @xmath10 ) , for comparison with experimental data .",
    "lacking sharp diffraction peaks or other distinctive features , that comparison nevertheless appears somewhat elusive .",
    "the tridymite structure shows slightly better agreement with experiment but represents a thermodynamically less likely candidate than @xmath2-cristobalite since its calculated dft enthalpy is 0.30.4ev / molecule higher .",
    "@xcite the electronic structure of either fourfold coordinated crystal structure agrees with the observed metalization in the region from 40gpa upwards .",
    "@xcite besides that , in more recent experiments performed on the high pressure metallic phases of cs@xmath0 , resistivity showed evidence of superconductivity at 46k over a broad pressure range from 50 to 172gpa .",
    "@xcite    from the theoretical point of view it is of course inadequate to merely trust the analogy between cs@xmath0 and co@xmath0 and extend it even to very high pressures . to expand somewhat our view",
    "we instead consider that co@xmath0 and cs@xmath0 are members of a broader family of iv ",
    "vi ab@xmath11 compounds including sio@xmath0 , silica , and sis@xmath0 , neither of which is molecular at zero pressure .",
    "silica is very well known for a number of tetrahedrally coordinated polymorphs including @xmath12-quartz , @xmath12- and @xmath2-cristobalite , tridymite , coesite , etc .",
    "much less studied until recently , sis@xmath0 exhibits totally different phases starting off at zero pressure with an orthorhombic ( so - called np ) crystal structure made up of edge - sharing carbon - centered tetrahedra ( see ref . ) very recently the high pressure phases of sis@xmath0 were experimentally characterized  @xcite and a whole sequence of phases hp1 , hp2 , hp3 , were described where the tetrahedra did not disappear but simply changed their mutual connectivity .    based on the limited available high - pressure data , solid cs@xmath0 is at the moment the least understood member of this highly important class of solids .",
    "even if starting at zero pressure with the same molecular _ cmca _ structure which co@xmath0 adopts at moderate pressure , cs@xmath0 need not develop at very high pressures the same structures as co@xmath0 . to fill this remaining knowledge gap we conducted an unbiased theoretical crystal structure search to explore high pressure structures of cs@xmath0 .",
    "this search revealed that at high pressures where the carbon coordination is four the @xmath2-cristobalite structural motif is indeed superseded by a novel , robust and unsuspected layered network of tetrahedra .",
    "only while preparing this manuscript , fresh high pressure experimental work on sis@xmath0 appeared ,  @xcite reporting the very same structure , designated there as hp1 .",
    "our theoretical search now found the tetrahedra - based structure of cs@xmath0 , which is lowest in enthalpy in a wide range of pressures from 30 to 170gpa , to be structurally identical with hp1 structure of sis@xmath0  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hp1 ] ) . based on this hp1 structure of cs@xmath11",
    "we calculated the raman spectra and pair distribution functions and found it to agree better with experimental data than those of @xmath2-cristobalite , the high pressure structure of co@xmath0 we also obtained predictions for the infrared ( ir ) absorption spectra , not yet available experimentally , that will hopefully serve in the future to experimentally corroborate or discard our predictions .",
    "the calculated electronic structure of high pressure metallized hp1-cs@xmath0 gpa moreover indicates a small fermi level density of states , questioning the intrinsic nature of the observed superconductivity .",

    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite generalized gradient approximation as implemented in vasp ( _ vienna ab - initio simulation package _ )  @xcite employed the projector - augmented plane wave ( paw ) method .",
    "@xcite the energy cutoff for the plane - wave basis was set to 550ev to ensure full convergence .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled by monkhorst - pack meshes with a resolution of @xmath16@xmath17 . since at low pressures the dispersion forces are important we employed for enthalpy calculations the optb86b - vdw scheme @xcite based on the van der waals density functional.@xcite lattice zero - point energies were not included and temperature was assumed to be zero throughout .",
    "the phonon , raman and ir spectra were instead calculated in linear response as implemented in the quantum espresso suite of programs within the lda approximation .",
    "@xcite for that , the gga input structures were further relaxed with lda before carrying out the phonon calculations .",
    "brute - force application of the ea structural search algorithm to a compound such as cs@xmath0 with a positive formation enthalpy should lead by necessity to chemical decomposition and outright disappearance of the compound itself . as was said above , even at ambient pressure molecular cs@xmath0 is metastable , meaning it is locally stable mechanically , and temporarily surviving due to exceedingly slow kinetics , while intrinsically unstable on thermodynamic grounds .",
    "the ea search ignores kinetics and will therefore lead to decomposition , given a large enough supercell . in this study , where we wish to find and study the high pressure metastable phases of the undecomposed compound ,",
    "a strict cs@xmath0 stoichiometry was assumed with an ea cell chosen to contain 12 atoms , i.e. four cs@xmath0 molecular units .",
    "even if small , that cell is actually still large enough to show decomposition and phase separation into carbon and sulfur in an unrestricted ea search .",
    "we therefore artificially prevented decomposition by constraining the ea search to avoid the formation of c  c and s ",
    "s first - neighbor bonds .",
    "this allows to find the high pressure crystal structures where decomposition , total or partial , is artificially suppressed .",
    "it should be noted that while the artificial nature of this constraint is such that it may endanger the formation of some denser structures at higher pressures , still various octahedral structures were also created , but their calculated enthalpies were considerably higher with respect to the tetrahedral ones .",
    "therefore , we will by construction limit ourselves to explore metastable structures with coordination larger than four . with this constraint ,",

    "the proposed hp1 structure represents a more plausible candidate structure for high pressure , fourfold coordinated cs@xmath0 than those considered so far .  @xcite both calculated pair correlations and raman spectra agree better with existing data than those of @xmath2-cristobalite .",
    "it will be a challenge for the experimentalists to try to prepare this phase in a crystalline state amenable to more accurate investigation in the future . to that end",
    "we provide substantial additional predictions , in particular of ir spectra , that should be crucial in identifying the new phase . despite its intrinsic metastability",
    ", the hp1-cs@xmath0 structure appears exceptionally robust .",
    "these qualities make cs@xmath0 a good candidate system for studies of high pressure simulated tribochemistry , a project which is presently going on in the trieste group .",
    "even though the layered hp1 structure is metallic above 50gpa , it seems unlikely that it should account for the experimentally observed superconductivity ,  @xcite because the density of states , and therefore the dimensionless @xmath39 , is likely to remain low after the band - overlap metallic state .",
    "although a reasonable hypothesis could be a possible partial decomposition of cs@xmath0 , with creation of some free sulfur filaments or other non stoichiometric products , we are not in a position to address that occurrence here .",
    "we note in closing that at pressures just before metallization , where the band gap closing of insulating hp1-cs@xmath0 is indirect , the crystal might develop a narrow charge - density - wave or spin - density - wave phase , characterized by a nesting wavevector close to @xmath47 f.  @xcite although there has been so far no observation of this kind in high pressure experiments , this possibility , which we also suggested for mos@xmath11 ,  @xcite seems worth pursuing .",
    "last and perhaps most important , our work provides a new link into the high pressure crystal chemistry of the archetypal family of iv - vi ab@xmath11 compounds made of light elements where previously only some cross similarities between co@xmath0 , sio@xmath0 , and sis@xmath0 were discussed .",
    "we show that there is some structural kinship of cs@xmath0 not just to co@xmath0 at low pressures , but eventually also to sis@xmath0 at higher pressures .",
