    "supernova ( sn ) 1987a in the large magellanic cloud is the first naked - eye sn in over three centuries , and the first sn remnant ( snr ) seen to form within a pre - existing circumstellar environment that has been mapped in significant detail .",
    "it serves as a vital test bed for the colliding winds model of mass - loss nebulae and the interaction of sn ejecta with interstellar and circumstellar material ( csm ) ; an important rung in the cosmological distance ladder ; a valuable probe of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; and a unique laboratory for studying snr formation and the final stages of massive star evolution .",
    "narrow emission lines in _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) spectra at day 80 ( after sn ) indicated the existence of a circumstellar nebula @xcite which was confirmed in long - slit [ ] and h@xmath4 spectroscopy on day 300 by @xcite .",
    "the first resolved images were taken in these same bands by @xcite on day 750 , and by @xcite on day 1037 , and indicated the existence of an elliptical structure with a central cavity , the latter evidenced by the rapid fall of radio signal from ejecta ",

    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging @xcite revealed this structure to be a dense circumstellar equatorial ring ( er ) flanked by two larger outer rings , while kinematics of the er proved it to be a planar ring , expanding at @xmath5 km  s@xmath1  and inclined at @xmath6 , rather than a limb - brightened ellipsoid @xcite .    in his model of self - similar interaction of ejecta with ambient media , @xcite demonstrated the development of a double - shock system , in which a forward blast wave is driven into the csm and a reverse shock is driven into the expanding ejecta , with a contact discontinuity between the shocked csm and shocked ejecta .",
    "models predicted this forward shock would impact the er between 1320 years after the sn explosion @xcite . making simple assumptions of symmetry ,",
    "this impact was expected to appear as an initial brightening at the northern ( closest ) segment of the er , and then spread in p.a .  to engulf the entire ring within roughly 1 year , due to light - travel delays across",
    "the er .    the first indications that the double - shock scenario was correct came in 1997 when a 250 km  s@xmath1  blue - shifted h@xmath4 feature was observed at p.a .",
    "29  @xcite and a ly@xmath4 feature was observed with velocity @xmath7 km  s@xmath1@xcite using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard _",
    "hst_. this h@xmath4 feature",
    "was quickly confirmed in wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging @xcite , and was interpreted as the first `` hot spot '' from the impact of high - velocity forward shock with the er @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath4 feature has been modeled and interpreted as neutral hydrogen in the csm between the sn and the er crossing the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "contrary to the simplest expectations , no new loci of er - ejecta interaction were discovered following the first hot spot for nearly three years , until @xcite reported a new brightening near p.a .",

    "i , we re - analyzed the wfpc2 data using psf - matched difference imaging , and traced the appearance of the first hot spot ( hs  1 - 029  using paper i notation ) to 1995 march , as well as most of the newly - discovered spots to early 1999 .",
    "we are now observing a unique period in the formation of snr  1987a as the high - velocity sn debris overtakes the slowly expanding er .",
    "while this interaction will eventually destroy the circumstellar nebula , it will provide unique opportunities in the coming years to explore the complicated products of stellar mass loss , by detailing the circumstellar environment directly through shock - heating .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray and uv flux from this interaction will reionize unseen portions of the nebular structure , revealing many of them for the first time .",
    "the visible consequences of the forward shock s impact on the er are apparent and developing rapidly . in  [ sec - obs ]",
    "we report new ground - based and stis observations taken of snr 1987a .",

    "we show that between the years 2000 and 2001 , the number of confirmed hot spots has nearly doubled (  [ ssec - disc ] ) , with spots now located in a nearly continuous distribution about the er (  [ ssec - loc ] ) .",

    "we analyze data taken on the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-m telescope with tip - tilt first - order wavefront correction , as part of an ongoing ground - based monitoring campaign of the sn and its circumstellar environment .",
    "data were taken on 2001 march 1718 [ 3.7  hr total integration ] and 2001 november 2728 [ 1.5  hr total integration ] with the osiris imager in the  1.084@xmath8 m line , and differenced from data reported in paper i ( 1998 october 6 from cirim , 1.5  hr total integration ; 1999 december 25 from osiris , 3.5  hr total integration ) using",
    "_ difimphot_.",
    "we analyze public and director s discretionary data from the _ hst _ archive , making use of :    * stis spectra ( g750 m grating , 2slit ) from 1997 april 26 [ day 3714 ] , 2000 may 1 [ day 4816 ] , 2000 october 21 [ day 4996 ] and 2001 april 27 [ day 5176 ] ; * stis f28x50lp imaging taken between 1997 december and 2001 april [ days 39415176 ] ; and * wfpc2 images taken through f336w , f439w , f555w , f656n , f658n , f675w , and f814w between 1994 february and 2000 february [ days 25374725 ]",
    ".    for clarity , figure [ pldate ] shows the correspondence between the number of days following the sn , the calendric date , and the epochs of all data mentioned above .",
    "pipeline reduced _ hst _ spectra and imaging were taken directly from the archive , and aberrant pixels ( listed in the data quality and hot pixel files ) were fixed using the method to be described shortly .",
    "stis spectra were co - added using cosmic - ray rejection , and finally wavelength calibrated using _ stsdas _ within the _ iraf _ data reduction and analysis system . cleaned wfpc2 and stis images",
    "were summed with cosmic - ray rejection , and stars 2 and 3 were removed using _ tiny tim _ model point - spread functions ( psfs ) , and geometric distortions in the pc chip @xcite were corrected using the _ drizzle _ routine with a 1:1 resampling .",
    "images were finally unsharp masked to remove any sky background .",
    "as in paper i , we apply the _ difimphot _ image subtraction techniques of @xcite , which employ fourier techniques to match empirically - derived stellar profiles between two images .",
    "this technique is limited to data with resolution better than @xmath9 pixels per fwhm , an effective critical minimum required for fourier transforms of imaging data . since the pc and stis images have a nominal resolution of @xmath10 pixels , we convolve the data with a circular gaussian of @xmath11 to achieve a final stellar psf of @xmath12 pixels .",
    "data are finally geometrically registered to a common orientation with residuals @xmath13 pixel rms ( pc ) and @xmath14 pixel rms ( stis ) . aperture and crowded - field photometry was performed using standard _",
    "@xcite techniques with _ tiny tim _ model psfs processed by identical procedures as the data to mimic the registration steps .",
    "pc fluxes were calculated using _",
    "synphot _ , including decontamination corrections , while stis imaging fluxes are presented in instrumental counts sec@xmath1 .",
    "as briefly outlined in paper i , hot pixels account for @xmath15 of both the pc and stis chips , and since most images were not spatially dithered , these pixels present a stochastic and non - gaussian source of noise . during the reduction procedures ( registration and smoothing ) , single hot pixels can take on point - source - like profiles , thereby creating a strong source of false signals .",
    "we correct known bad pixels by replacing each with the median value of the 8 surrounding pixels , taken from an initial cosmic - ray cleaned image .",
    "the difference between the original and cleaned images is a `` contamination image , '' i.e.  a map of the bad pixels locations , which accompanies each data image through each step of the reduction pipeline . since many data sets consist of only two images ,",
    "often not spatially dithered , we recognize that this correction technique is predominantly cosmetic , and hence to minimize false detections in our analysis , a potential hot spot signal must not lie within a bad - pixel domain , and must appear in at least two difference images created from mutually exclusive epochs .",
    "as in paper i , we perform difference - image analysis to search for new hot spots .",
    "the contrast between hot spots and the underlying er is greater in  1.083@xmath8 m than in optical lines at early times , thus imaging is a sensitive probe of new er - ejecta interaction .",
    "figure [ hei ] displays a tiling of images from our ground - based monitoring .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the er and hs  1 - 029  resolved between stars 2 and 3 on 1998 october 6 , taken with the cirim imager .",
    "panels ( b)(d ) show data from the osiris imager taken on 1999 december 25 ; 2001 march 1718 ; and 2001 november 2728 ( as noted in each window ) .",
    "panel ( c ) clearly shows the brightening of the spot 25 complex , and the fading of star 3 ( a known variable star ) . in panel ( d ) , we see that hot spot flux has dramatically brightened in eight months , nearly engulfing the entire er .",
    "panels ( e)(h ) display psf - matched difference images made with the above data , as noted in the top of each window .",
    "the discovery data from @xcite is shown in panel ( e ) .",
    "this difference image , between 1998 and 1999 , was photometrically scaled using the fluxes of stars of constant brightness located throughout the field . as such ,",
    "white regions have brightened and black regions have faded since the earlier epoch .",
    "we see the continued brightening of hs  1 - 029 , the faint appearance of hs  2 - 104 , and the fading er to the west .",
    "panel ( f ) displays the data from 2001 march subtracted by 1999 december , again scaled photometrically to constant stellar flux . while hot spot emission from p.a.30150  is clear , comparison of the western half of the er to that in panel ( e ) reveals that the fading er has been offset by a continuous locus of brightening flux .",
    "this trend is confirmed in panel ( g ) , a difference image made between 2001 november and 1999 december , in which we now see the southwestern limb of the er standing out distinctly from the background . to better examine the extent of this brightening , we display the difference between 2001 november and 2001 march in panel ( h ) .",
    "flux is evident along the entire er except the region roughly located between p.a .",
    "160  and p.a . 210",
    "; even this latter region must be brightening marginally , otherwise the fading of the underlying er would result in negative ( black ) pixels . at this resolution",
    ", we can not be certain of the actual distribution of sources producing this continuous , positive image superposed on the fading er material .",
    "we consider it realistic that this reflects unresolved emission from a population of young hot spots distributed roughly uniformly about the er . flux has increased around the position of hs  1 - 029  the most , yet the flux distribution at this position is elongated ( south and westward ) , notably differing from the image s psf .",
    "this is suggestive that the brightening is not due to hs  1 - 029  alone , but can be attributed to the rapid brightening of a population of spots on either side of hs  1 - 029 .    while the above ground - based data are effective at describing the global behavior of the er - ejecta interaction , we study the smaller - scale evolution with _ hst_.",
    "the er is resolved well enough to allow us to compensate for its fading by scaling images to be differenced by its flux ( rather than by constant stellar photometry ) , which we measure in elliptical arcs in both images . for most epochs",
    ", we employ an arc of radial width @xmath16 between p.a .",
    "30010 , however as more of the er becomes contaminated with new spots , we co - add several smaller arcs distributed about the ring . since the er fades non - uniformly , the ring is often over - subtracted in some places , and stellar residuals often remain .",

    "f658n have been taken , it is not straightforward to measure a monochromatic flux in h@xmath4 through this filter . ] between 2000 february 2 and 1998 february 5 .",
    "the flux from hs  1 - 029  has been removed using the _ tiny tim _ model psf , however a small core remains .",
    "we clearly see the first six spots , as reported from these data by @xcite using independent reduction techniques , as well as hs  7 - 289reported by @xcite . a faint signature of hs  10 - 040 , as well as marginal features at p.a .",
    "174and 314 , as reported by @xcite from 2000 may 1 stis observations , are also detectable . since stellar residuals remain due to the er scaling , flux from hs  6 - 229",
    "is a combination of emission from the hot spot and coincident star 5 ( p.a.=230 , @xmath18 ) .    in light of the rapid developments in hot spot discovery in early 2000",
    ", we took stis spectra and imaging on 2000 may 1 , 2000 october 29 , and 2001 april 27 ( through director s discretionary observing time on _ hst _ ) .",
    "figure [ images]b shows a difference image made in the f28x50lp imaging filter , between 2000 november 3 and 1998",
    "november 14 .",
    "again , flux from hs  1 - 029  has been removed .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned spots , hs  11 - 355  @xcite can be seen .",
    "figure [ images]c shows a similar difference image in f28x50lp between 2001 april 27 and 1998 november 14 .",
    "a new feature slightly eastward of hs  10 - 040  is apparent once hs  1 - 029  is removed , and faint signatures from p.a.s 163 , 248  and 314  also appear .    to create a systematic observing strategy which maximizes the information gathered in a single spectrum ,",
    "while dovetailing with previous observations with stis , we imaged the entire er in the g750 m grating with the same @xmath19 slit orientation as the 1997 april spectrum for the 2000 may and 2001 april observations , and rotated by 180for 2000 october .",
    "this produces spatially - resolved monochromatic images of the entire er in a large number of transitions with a velocity scale of @xmath20 km  s@xmath1  pix@xmath1 .",
    "since the er has a rest - frame expansion velocity of 10.3 km  s@xmath1@xcite , even nascent hot spots are clearly detectable by the doppler shifting of their high - velocity emission away from the er . furthermore , the identical slit orientations allow direct spectral image subtraction from previous epochs , preserving data quality while easily removing the background er flux .",
    "results reported from paper i were generated from a direct subtraction of the 1997 and 2000 may spectra , however since the 2000 october spectrum has no identically - oriented antecedent , we scaled the neighboring [ ] @xmath176583 image to remove the h@xmath4 er image .",
    "the flux of hs  1 - 029  was 15 times greater in h@xmath4 than [ ] in a @xmath21 stis spectrum from 1999 august 30 , hence this er removal should not affect the discovery of new spots . in figure [ images]d , we see an asymmetric tail toward the east from hs  1 - 029 , identified by @xcite as hs  10 - 040 , as well as a faint smear at the location of hs  11 - 355 .",
    "furthermore , marginal detections are seen at approximate p.a.s 170 , 250 , and 315 . figures [ images]e  f show direct spectral subtractions of the 2001 april h@xmath4 image from that taken in 1997 april and 2000 may , respectively . since the slit is oppositely oriented from that in panel ( d )",
    ", the direction of doppler shifting is reversed .",
    "hs  11 - 355  is unambiguous , as are spectral smears around p.a .",
    "50  and 250 ; a faint signature is detected at p.a .",
    "165  and we again note the marginal flux around p.a .",
    "@xcite identified these bright new features as hs  12 - 050 , hs  13 - 165  and hs  14 - 249 , while the flux at p.a.315 , although very suggestive , is still too faint to reliably distinguish it from noise",
    ".    comparison of the roughly concurrent stis and ground - based images from early 2001 reveals at least some subset of the population of young spots distributed about the er which we inferred from the data .",
    "interpretation of the more recent ground - based imaging from 2001",
    "november is ambiguous , given the high - resolution stis antecedent .",
    "it is possible , and not without precedent , that additional hot spots have appeared , resulting in the nearly - complete brightening about the er seen in figure [ hei]h .",
    "the spots reported above have certainly brightened as well , and at the ground - based resolution , spots separated by 2030  will appear unresolved .",
    "a spot s light curve can accelerate quite dramatically in short periods of time , as we show in  [ ssec - evol ] , thus it is possible that the extended flux seen around hs  1 - 029  in figure [ hei]h is due to sudden brightening of spots 1012 .",
    "questions such as these can only be resolved from _",
    "hst _ imaging , and given the rapid variation manifest in the number and fluxes of hot spots , systematically - planned observations at _ least _ twice a year are mandated , if we wish to properly monitor the sequence of spot appearance and their evolution .",
    "using both the wfpc2 and stis imaging data affords us a large set in which we measure the positions of all currently detected hot spots .",
    "we measure the flux center of the sn in the wfpc2 data using the f675w image from 1994 .",
    "the wide passband ensures that higher - velocity emission in the bright optical lines of h@xmath4 and [ ] will be included , while at this early date the optical ejecta was resolved but still relatively compact and appeared symmetric .",
    "we then geometrically registered this image to the stis data , and used the centroid in this frame for stis measurements .",
    "centroids for individual hot spots were measured using the psf - fitting routines within _ daophot _ applied to each difference image in which the spot is unambiguously detected . using the positional uncertainties presented in  [ sec - tests ] , we calculate the weighted average and weighted variance of the measured centroids of each spot in each difference - image pair .",
    "the resulting positions , relative to the measured sn centroid , are presented in table [ tbl - pos ] .",
    "quoted errors are the probable uncertainties in each parameter , given by the weighted variance of each set of spot positions , but do not take into account any systematic uncertainty in our adopted sn centroid .",
    "we will address this in a forthcoming paper on astrometry of the sn and surrounding field stars .",
    "preliminary results indicate that our measured centroid is consistent with accurate astrometry of the sn in 1987 @xcite using vlbi and _ hipparcos _ positional data .    the orientation of the er and locations of hot spots are shown in figure [ er ] .",
    "spots are marked by cross - hairs , and confirmed spots are labeled by their ids .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the continued lack of brightening , and inward radial positions of spots hs  8 - 064  and hs  9 - 075  appear more consistent with reverse - shock emission than as ejecta - er interaction ( paper i ) .",
    "we mark their locations by `` @xmath22 '' for clarity , but hereafter remove them from the hot spot list .",
    "spot positions are also indicated around the er in figures [ deproj]a and [ deproj]c . as suggested by both _",
    "hst _ and ground - based imaging , this system has undergone a notable transition within the last year , from a few distinct hot spots at isolated locations to a nearly continuous distribution around the er , with few breaks larger than 45  in p.a .",
    "an obvious exercise to perform with this positional data is to search for motion of hot spot centroids in time . at the time of writing this paper ,",
    "only the first three hot spots have been sufficiently bright for enough of an extended period of time to test for proper motion .",
    "we plot in figure [ hsmove ] the radial distance of these spots from the sn as measured in filters containing h@xmath4 , for those epochs in which each spot has an unambiguous profile for centering .",
    "the top half of each panel shows the observed ( or `` projected , '' assuming the er is a circular ring inclined to the line of sight ) radial position of each spot versus observation date .",
    "the bottom panel shows the deprojected distance of the spot from the sn , using the geometric parameters determined in ",
    "[ ssec - param ] . for each locus of points",
    ", we show the best - fit line through the data , determined by standard linear least - squares .",
    "the slopes of these lines give the proper motion of the centroid of each hot spot , and are listed in table [ tbl - mov ] .",
    "we denote the velocity of the centroid by @xmath23 , which for the three spots listed have an average value of 20003000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "field stars within the lmc should not have significant proper motion over the time period considered , thus the measured positions of these stars serve as estimates of our expected random uncertainty .",
    "we plot the radial distance of three stars ( of different flux ) from the sn in figure [ hsmove_err ] .",
    "values along the @xmath24-axis have been offset by scalars such that the brightest star is at the top of the figure .",
    "since the band - pass of the f28x50lp filter is wider than that of f675w , which in turn is wider than f656n , a bright star in the former appears faint in the latter . as such , the faintest of the three stars was not detectable in f656n .",
    "we list in table [ tbl - mov ] the slope of the best - fit line through each star s position , and find these are consistent with no proper motion , as expected .",
    "the flux of field star 1 is similar to that of hs  1 - 029  in f656n , but is far brighter than any spot in f675w or f28x50lp ; field star 2 is representative of hs  1 - 029  in the wide - pass filters , and a faint spot in f656n ; and field star 3 is similar to a faint spot in the wide - band filters .",
    "using the above guidelines , hs  1 - 029  is `` bright '' and and hs  2 - 104  and hs  3 - 126  are `` faint '' in most of the epochs considered .",
    "we see that the probable errors in the best - fit slopes of the projected data are fairly consistent with a random noise model ; the deprojected errors are larger in part due to uncertainties in the geometric parameters of the er .      to accurately interpret the positions of the hot spots on the er , we begin by studying the er geometry .",
    "a more detailed description of the procedures will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "briefly , we generated an image of the er at @xmath25 pix@xmath1 resolution ( double the pc - chip ) by drizzling @xcite data at 2:1 resampling from the f656n and f658n filters ( h@xmath4 + [ ] ) between 1994 and 1996 .",
    "hs  1 - 029  emission was low , but non - negligible in 1996 , and we removed its contributions to the er by subtracting tiny tim model psfs scaled to the hs  1 - 029  fluxes as determined in  [ ssec - evol ] .    the sn ejecta and outer ring contributions were masked out , then levenburg - marquardt least - squares minimization @xcite was used to find the best - fit ellipse to isophotes of the er flux . since the flux distribution in the er is not uniform , but is generally brighter to the northwest quadrant @xcite , it is important that the flux be normalized in a manner which does not give excess geometric weight to any part of the ring , while still allowing the er to be distinguished from `` the shelf '' to the northeast @xcite and low - level surrounding flux .",
    "we achieved this by splitting the er into @xmath26 wedges of equal angular size , and normalizing the pixels in each wedge by the second - largest pixel value in that wedge .",
    "this choice of normalization factor was made to avoid contamination by bad pixels or low - probability gaussian outliers .",
    "isophotes of the er were constructed by including only the upper fraction @xmath27 of the normalized flux from each wedge , where each wedge flux was integrated in order of descending pixel value .",
    "we fit a general ellipse with the center @xmath28 , axes @xmath29 and rotation angle @xmath30 as free parameters to the er , using isophotes for @xmath31 in steps of 0.01 , then averaged the resulting parameters together for a variety of values of @xmath26 .",
    "these choices of @xmath27 correspond to the elliptical annuli containing 80% and 20% ( respectively ) of the total er flux within 16 .",
    "assuming the er is a circular ring , inclined to the line of sight by @xmath32 , then @xmath33 .",
    "the p.a .  of the major axis is the rotation angle @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting values are listed in table [ tbl - geo ] , where reported errors are variances only .",
    "we will test the presence of systematics within our method in a ( aforementioned ) forthcoming paper ; an estimate of  pixel , or @xmath34 is suggested as a combined uncertainty in axis lengths and sn centroid .",
    "we compare our data with those from @xcite and @xcite in table [ tbl - geo ] .",
    "@xcite performed a careful study of the er geometry using pre - costar wfpc and foc images of sn  1987a , predominantly in [ ] , but also including [ ] at lower signal - to - noise .",
    "@xcite performed a similar study using wfpc2 images in f502n , f547 m , and f656n .",
    "our results are generally consistent with previous values . of note , we find that the er centroid is not coincident with our measured value for that of the sn , as also found by @xcite . the high - resolution h@xmath4 + [ ] image is shown in figure [ deproj]a , with the ellipse characterized by our best - fit parameters drawn as a white dashed line .",
    "the major and minor axes have been drawn in black , showing the rotated p.a .",
    "of the major axis as well as the offset centroid from that of the sn .",
    "tick marks in gray along the minor axis denote light - travel delays of one month . in general",
    "the ellipse is a good fit , however a detailed examination reveals considerable scatter about this mean fit .",
    "this is more easily seen when the er has been deprojected and unrolled into a map of observed p.a .  versus rest - frame distance from the sn centroid , shown in figure [ deproj]b . for clarity ,",
    "a fainter stretch of the same data has been plotted in figure [ deproj]c , with contours to highlight structure .",
    "the dotted curve is the deprojected best - fit ellipse , and takes on the sinusoidal shape since the sn and er centroids do not coincide .",
    "a pure circular ring would map to this dotted line , and we see considerable scatter about the mean .",
    "while it is somewhat simplistic to expect the er , which is clearly seen to be composed of bright knots embedded within tenuous and extended gas , to be a perfect circular ring , it is unclear from this mapping what its true geometry may be . if the er is inherently elliptical [ as suggested by @xcite ] , we would expect the p.a.s of extremal recession velocity would not coincide with the measured minor axes , while the nodes would not lie on the major axes ; this might be measurable by a detailed , high - resolution ( both spatial and in wavelength ) spectrum . rather , if the er were warped , sections could appear more or less distant from the centroid than the majority of the gas , however this effect could only be distinguished through three - dimensional mapping .",
    "currently , the three - dimensional circumstellar structures mapped in light echoes by @xcite have not revealed such a warp in the equatorial plane , however a re - analysis of that data using our improved techniques of psf - matched difference - imaging @xcite might have the sensitivity to reveal such features , if present .",

    "the total flux in all spots has grown monotonically to @xmath61 ergs  @xmath57  s@xmath1  in roughly six years .",
    "since the hot spot emission is dominated by h@xmath4 , we compare this value to the @xcite models , which reach the same line flux far more rapidly : 0.25 , 0.75 , 0.7 , and 0.65 years after the line emission begins ( for density models a , b , c , and d respectively ) .",
    "following a nearly instantaneous turn - on , models a , b , and d grow roughly linearly to a peak and turn over in approximately 1.5 , 3.5 and 3 years , respectively , while model c is still brightening ( in bursts ) after 6.5 years .",
    "in contrast , the observed evolution at the time of publication is quite gradual and has yet to plateau .",
    "finally , the predicted model flux for the latest data reported in this paper should be between @xmath62@xmath63 ergs  @xmath57  s@xmath1 , having already passed the maximum peak flux .",
    "it is not surprising that this model poorly correlates to the observed evolution , since the actual interaction has proven stochastic while their idealized model considered the impact simultaneous along the whole inner surface of a toroidal er .",
    "furthermore , their model did not consider the blast front propagating through an intervening region .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the integrated light curve of the er - ejecta interaction will evolve like one of these models once the ejecta impact the main inward surface of the ring .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite and noted by @xcite , hot spots are most easily detected at early times in spectra , however in the absence of a systematically - planned stis observing program which samples the entire er ( such as that presented in this work ) , they are most effectively revealed with psf - matched difference imaging . as noted in  [ sec - obs ] ,",
    "hot pixels constitute a significant source of contamination and confusion in _ hst _ data , and the accurate detection of new hot spots at early times depends entirely on our ability to distinguish them from the abundant sources of noise .",
    "proper detection of this rapidly - changing phenomenon requires confirmation in multiple epochs of data , however high - resolution data are relatively sparse : wfpc2 imaging is taken roughly only once per year , and stis spectra are predominantly narrow - slit slices through the er rather than 2  spectral images of the entire ring . while we make every effort to maximize the data quality of _ hst _ imaging to reliably detect new loci of interaction along the er , it is important to understand the limitations inherent to these data .    to test the reliability of new hot spot detection",
    ", we generated artificial data as follows .",
    "all known hot spots were removed from the f656n images from 1999 january and 1999 april using a _",
    "tiny tim _ model psf , then 10 pairs of images were created , each containing a random number of hot spots ( average of 5 spots per image ) , of random flux ( ranging from the faintest to brightest actual spot fluxes ) , situated randomly around the inner - half of the er ( where we observe new spots forming ) , with the flux of each spot in 1999 april 10% brighter than 1999 january .",
    "these data were differenced from f656n images from 1998 and 1997 , and analyzed using the same criteria as applied to actual spot detection .",
    "table [ tbl - acc ] contains the results from this exercise . for each given flux range",
    ", @xmath64 is the total number of sources we identified in all images , @xmath65 is the number of sources which were not actual spots , and @xmath66 is the number of actual spots which we missed .",
    "we see that our detection procedure is @xmath67100% complete for the majority of the applicable flux range , and roughly 60% complete at the faintest end , corresponding to the very faintest spots ( e.g.  hs  5 - 139 ) at their earliest detections .",
    "the employment of psf - fitting crowded - field photometric techniques from _ daophot _ follows from the obvious crowding in some hot spot regions , but also from the noise characteristics of the data .",
    "as seen in figure [ images ] , hot spots lie on the inner edge of the er , translating in difference images to the boundary between the uniform region interior to the ring , and the non - uniformly fading er .",
    "since the background varies on pixel - to - pixel scales , a large sky annulus will likely not reflect the actual background of the hot spot .",
    "many hot spots are faint , and are more strongly affected by poisson noise and the omnipresent warm pixel contamination when performing simple aperture photometry .",
    "task performs a non - linear least - squares fit of an analytic stellar profile to each source , while dynamically fitting both the underlying sky and nearby sources",
    ". this should , in principle , provide the most reliable centroid and flux estimate for a hot spot , by directly addressing the above difficulties .",
    "this was directly tested by generating an additional set of 5 pairs of images with hot spots of random flux placed at the known hot spot positions , differencing them as above , and performing both standard aperture ( with _ phot _ ) , and crowded - field ( with _ allstar _ ) photometry .",
    "photometric accuracy for the latter , and positional accuracy for both algorithms are listed in the final three columns of table [ tbl - acc ] .",
    "aperture photometry yielded errors of roughly 50% for fainter sources and in crowded regions .",
    "in contrast , _ allstar _ errors are generally within the formal photometric uncertainties . in most cases , centroids measured with _",
    "are more accurate as well , since flux - weighted centroids often drift toward a brighter nearby source or warm pixel .",
    "following the radiative shock model of ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the sn ejecta expanded at @xmath68 km  s@xmath1until it encountered an region of density @xmath69 interior to the er , which was formed when the blue supergiant progenitor photoionized stellar winds ejected during its previous red supergiant phase @xcite .",
    "this encounter drove a forward shock into the region with a velocity @xmath70 , which ultimately impacts a protrusion of density @xmath71 in the er . the density jump implies the shock propagates into the protrusion with velocity @xmath72 where @xmath73 accounts for the obliquity of the shock were calculated for a plane - parallel shock impacting a cylinder with density contrast @xmath74 , and ignored time - variable effects ( e.  michael , private communication ) . ] , and ranges from 2 for a head - on shock to 0.7 for @xmath75 .",
    "the time for the shocked gas to radiatively cool from the postshock @xmath76  k to @xmath77  k , at which the gas emits largely in the optical , is @xmath38 . for velocities in the range of a few hundred km  s@xmath1 , @xcite report @xmath78 yr , where @xmath79 is the density in units of @xmath80 @xmath81 . with infinite spatial resolution , the optical observation of a new parcel of emitting gas",
    "would only show where the shock had been a time @xmath38 earlier . since this cooling time is a function of @xmath82 , @xmath71 and the chemical composition of the er , each emitting parcel of gas does so with its own set of these parameters .",
    "the hot spots which we observe are the integrated light curves of all the er material in a seeing element through which the forward shock has passed , and the centroids we measure , derived from regions too small to be resolved by _ hst _ , are the luminosity - weighted 2-d projections of 3-d emitting volumes .",
    "the observed motion of the hot spot s centroids is thus the measurement of the radial increase in _ average _ emitting area in time , and can only serve as a lower limit to the velocity of the shock causing the emission .",
    "consider what one would observe as the forward blast moves down the side of an inward - facing protrusion .",
    "if one idealizes the protrusion as a cylinder of constant density , the forward shock as planar with constant velocity @xmath70 , and ignoring optical thickness effects and radiative precursors , then the cooling time @xmath38 will be constant . as the shock moves down the cylinder",
    ", the transmitted shock velocity @xmath82 will be constant and much less than @xmath70 , thus an observation at infinite resolution would show a uniform growth of emission down the axis at velocity @xmath70 . at our limited resolution",
    ", we instead observe the flux - barycenter of all emitting material , and hence measure a velocity equal to @xmath83 .",
    "for a similarly constructed conical ( or truncated cone ) protrusion , the observed velocity would be @xmath84 .",
    "of course , an actual protrusion has a complicated ( and as yet unknown ) geometry and density structure , both of which mediate the variation of the cooling timescale and the mass ( per unit time ) swept - up by the forward blast , as the blast moves down the protrusion .",
    "nonetheless , from geometry alone we expect the observed spot velocity to be of order half the blast velocity . from table",
    "[ tbl - pos ] , @xmath37 is the inferred blast velocity needed to reach a given spot , assuming the blast expanded uniformly to @xmath16 during the first @xmath85 days , and has an average value of @xmath6730005000 km  s@xmath1for most spots . recall that these values do not include estimates for @xmath38 , which would increase these inferred velocities by hundreds of km  s@xmath1  per year of cooling time ( eq .  [ eqn-1 ] ) . assuming a 12 yr cooling time , we find the values of @xmath37 are of order 12 times those of @xmath23 , consistent with the heuristic expectation above .",
    "we thus interpret @xmath23 as a rough measurement of half the blast velocity , implying @xmath86 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "hot spot evolution is now considered according to the following scenario .",
    "a hot spot arises on an inward - facing protrusion from the er , as shown in figure 3 of @xcite . from the radiative shock model , @xmath87 thus the time at which post - shocked gas actually emits visible line radiation is a sensitive function of the obliquity of the shock .",
    "the blast wave first strikes the tip of the protrusion head - on , and thus has a long cooling time ( since @xmath88 ) .",
    "as the blast wave travels down the length of the protrusion , @xmath89 hence @xmath38 decreases substantially . for @xmath90 km  s@xmath1  and @xmath91 , @xmath92 yr for a head - on shock , and @xmath93 yr for a side shock .",
    "an observed hot spot at early times is thus the shocked gas along the protrusion s sides cooling into an optically - emitting temperature range . once the shock reaches the base of the protrusion , @xmath94 and @xmath38 increases again .",
    "flux in the early - time light curve will grow substantially as new gas is shocked by the blast wave along the side of the protrusion .",
    "once the blast reaches the protrusion base , emission will be dominated by newly - shocked gas from the slow shocks moving into the protrusion along its sides , and since roughly equal volume will be swept - up per unit time , the light curve should flatten and grow monotonically ( assuming the shocked gas does not cool out of the optical for a long time , perhaps due to photoionization from shocked material upstream ) . only after many years",
    "will the light curve suddenly accelerate again , as the gas at the tip and base cool into the optical - emitting regime . at early times",
    ", the tips of the shocked protrusions should be substantial x - ray emitters , while the sides emit optical and near - ir lines .",
    "the correlation of a population of x - ray bright spots with optical hot spots @xcite in _ chandra _ imaging is suggestive of this interpretation .",
    "the late - time flattening of the lightcurve of hs  1 - 029may be explained via this model . from figure [ deproj ] ,",
    "the protrusion on which hs  1 - 029  appears is long and fairly isolated from the neighboring er material .",
    "idealizing this as a truncated conical protrusion of length @xmath95@xmath21 ( as measured in panel b of figure [ deproj ] ) , the forward blast would require roughly 15003000 days to travel its length , assuming a velocity of 3000 km  s@xmath1([ssec - loc ] ) . as shown in ",
    "[ ssec - evol ] , the light - curve of hs  1 - 029  shows a significant change in slope beginning sometime around day 47005000 , i.e.  18002200 days after its earliest appearance , and within the expected range noted above . a physical scale of hs",
    "1 - 029  can be estimated using the radial position of hs  10 - 040 , assuming the forward shock had to pass the hs  1 - 029  material before impacting that of hs  10 - 040 .",
    "the radial position of hs  10 - 040  is highly uncertain ; however , using its central value and the initial radial distance of hs  1 - 029 , the deprojected radial difference in distance is @xmath96 , or @xmath97 cm .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath98 cm found by @xcite using spectroscopic considerations , and at this size , the expected time for the break in slope of the light curve of hs  1 - 029  is consistent with that observed .",
    "this is suggestive that the heuristics of our model are correct , and that the forward blast is nearing the inner edge of the er ( rather than a protrusion ) in the vicinity of hs  1 - 029 .",
    "our model also suggests a possible explanation for the linear light curves of spots 25 . if these protrusions are small in radial extent , the time necessary for the shock to move down their sides is greatly reduced , hence the spot s emission would spend little time in the initial rapid - brightening phase , and would quickly display the more monotonic increase in flux consistent with the transmitted shock moving into its sides .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the observed light - curves of the first five spots thus suggest that hs  1 - 029lies on a longer radial protrusion than that of hs  2 - 104  or hs  5 - 139 , which in turn are longer than hs  3 - 126  or hs  4 - 091 .",
    "why did hs  1 - 029  turn on over three years prior to any others ?",
    "is there something unique about this spot which requires a separate physical explanation ?",
    "figure [ er ] suggests that hot spots occur on inward - facing protrusions from the main er , which would naturally be the first sites to be struck by an isotropically - expanding forward blast wave . from figure [ deproj ] , we see that nearly all spots do appear to lie at the extrema of inward - facing protrusions .",
    "furthermore , hs  1 - 029  is located , in the deprojected frame , on the most inward - facing protrusion , and from figure [ hsmove ] we see that its early - time position was roughly @xmath99 closer to the sn than other spots .",
    "examination of the values of @xmath37 in table [ tbl - pos ] , which were calculated using the early - time positions of spots , suggests that there was no preferential velocity required for hs  1 - 029  to turn on as early as it did .",
    "rather , we argue that the early appearance of hs  1 - 029results mainly from its inward position with respect to the other hot spot protrusions .    values of @xmath37 for all spots are suggestive of a roughly uniform blast velocity of 30005000 km  s@xmath1 , consistent with that inferred in the radio by @xcite , in _ hst _ spectroscopy by @xcite , in _",
    "chandra _ x - ray imaging ( @xmath100 km  s@xmath1 ) by @xcite and in _ chandra _ x - ray spectra ( @xmath101 km  s@xmath1 ) by @xcite .",
    "we now explore whether we can glean additional information about the forward blast from the observed positions and earliest appearance of the hot spots .",
    "if we use @xmath102 as a relative estimate ( with respect to the sn ) of when a hot spot first turned on , the following spots are mutually coeval : spots 2 and 3 ; spots 4 through 6 ; spots 10 and 13 ; and spots 11 , 12 , and 14 . since hs  2 - 104  and hs  3 - 126  have nearly identical deprojected distances and values of @xmath37 , there is no need to invoke significant inhomogeneity in the forward blast to explain the order of the appearance of these neighboring spots .",
    "spots 46 , however , suggest a different trend .",
    "the deprojected distances of hs  4 - 091  and hs  6 - 229  are marginally discrepant at the 1@xmath103 level , implying that the blast wave had to travel significantly faster to hs  6 - 229  for it to turn on at the same time as hs  4 - 091 .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , hot spot positions suggest a rough trend that the required shock velocity varies somewhat continuously with p.a .",
    ", lowest to the north and northeast around hs  11 - 355  and hs  1 - 029 , and increasing to the west around hs  6 - 229  and hs  7 - 289 .",
    "this could also be explained by invoking variations in shapes of the protrusions hosting the hot spots , since the cooling time @xmath38 is such a strong function of geometry",
    ".    inspection of the locations of spots around the er shows that roughly @xmath104 of confirmed spots are located along the eastern half of the ring",
    ". this would be the natural result were the forward blast to arrive at that half first .",
    "this suggests two possible explanations .",
    "first , the sn centroid is offset to the east of that of the er . recall that in  [ ssec - param ] , we find our measured sn centroid is offset by 20 mas to the east of the er centroid .",
    "we also find in table [ tbl - pos ] that eastern spots appear closer ( in the deprojected frame ) to the sn than those in the west .",
    "a simple assumption of symmetry suggests that the deprojected positions of hot spots should be roughly equidistant from the sn , implying that our measured sn centroid might be inaccurate , perhaps due to asymmetry in the ejecta in 1994 , or patchy absorption from dust within the ejecta ( as suggested by our referee ) .",
    "we quickly tested this by measuring spot positions from the er centroid , and found that while this does result in an increase of the deprojected distance of easterly spots and a decrease for westerly spots , the overall effect is not large enough to fully reconcile the discrepant distances presented . recalling that spots appear on inward - facing protrusions",
    ", we may speculate that in addition to an offset sn centroid , spots to the east may lie on systematically - longer protrusions . with the data currently presented",
    ", we can not rule out this hypothesis or the first explanation .",
    "second , an inhomogeneity in the forward - blast exists on the largest scale .",
    "@xcite find from narrow - slit stis spectra that the reverse shock is roughly 5% further from the sn at p.a.@xmath67220  than at p.a.@xmath6740 , concluding that csm interior to the er is more tenuous along the far ( southwestern ) side of the ring .",
    "recent images of the radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite remnants both show increased emission toward the eastern side of the er . @xcite interprets the bulk of the x - ray and non - thermal radio emission as arising from a zone of shocked sn debris and csm between the forward blast and reverse shock . a detailed study of _ chandra _ x - ray imaging @xcite shows that x - ray bright knots are well correlated with the optical hot spots , however @xcite argue that only @xmath674% of the x - ray emission can come from these spots , and suggest that the observed x - ray asymmetry is indicative of denser csm material to the east interacting with the blast wave .",
    "this , they propose , could result from either an asymmetric sn explosion or an asymmetric csm , as follows .",
    "if the sn explosion is symmetric , and the csm is denser to the east , then the forward blast would travel faster into the western half of the er . conversely , if the csm is symmetric , then the blast wave must have travelled faster in the eastern direction , shocking denser csm closer to the er .    we briefly consider this latter scenario .",
    "if the increased radio emission to the east results uniquely from a higher blast velocity toward that half of the ring , we should expect the western emission to mimic that in the east with a roughly constant time delay .",
    "comparison of super - resolved images of snr  1987a from @xcite show that the western radio emission in 1999.7 and 2000.8 is at roughly the same flux as eastern emission in 1995.7 and 1996.7 , respectively .",
    "continued monitoring of the radio remnant will show whether this four - year time - delay is persistent .",
    "consider now the former scenario , in which the csm is asymmetric .",
    "the three - ring nebulosity surrounding the sn has largely been attributed to the interaction of the progenitor star s blue and red supergiant ( bsg and rsg ) winds via the interacting stellar winds model @xcite .",
    "equatorial overdensities in a previously - expelled slow , dense wind focus a fast , tenuous wind into a polar trajectory , the interaction from which produces a bipolar peanut - shaped nebula , or wind - blown bubble @xcite .",
    "the er is the overdense waist of the peanut , the inside of which was largely evacuated by the bsg wind .",
    "the visible ring is most likely the inner skin of the overdensity , which was optically thick to the uv and soft x - ray flash from the sn , but is optically thin to the cooling line emission we now observe .",
    "if the rsg circumstellar outflow had been denser toward the eastern half of the equatorial plane , then the inner cavity which the bsg wind carved out would have been closer to the central star in that direction than toward the west .",
    "this would have resulted in an observed er that is offset from the sn centroid , and an overall density enhancement within the equatorial plane to the east .",
    "while we can not rule out an asymmetric explosion , values of @xmath37 suggest the shock is traveling faster into the western half of the er , i.e. that the asymmetry lies in the csm .",
    "we thus favor the equatorial density enhancement proposed above , which may explain both the offset er centroid and proposed csm asymmetry .",
    "this situation should have left its imprint on the geometry of the contact discontinuity between the rsg wind and the previously - equilibrated bubble filled by the progenitor s main sequence wind @xcite .",
    "this interface was found by @xcite at 915  in light echoes , and will be tested in a re - examination of those data by @xcite .    while the above work suggests that a fairly isotropic blast wave can explain the appearance of most spots , it is unlikely that the blast wave has traveled uniformly ( or continues to ) in all directions into a visibly inhomogeneous medium .",
    "as the forward shock approaches the er , it must encounter an increasing density gradient , which will cause it to decelerate on the largest scales .",
    "this has been addressed by e.g.@xcite ; and @xcite via the low - density region previously mentioned .",
    "@xcite find that rayleigh - taylor instabilities develop in the contact discontinuity between the shocked material and shocked ejecta .",
    "these can develop into plumes that redirect previously - reflected shocks back into the er in spots rather than uniformly @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect strong velocity inhomogeneities on small scales . whether or not this mechanism is responsible for hs  6 - 229  and hs  7 - 289 both of which appear further from the sn than neighboring protrusions ( see figure [ deproj]c ) , is unclear .",
    "the probability of a randomly - placed plume impacting an inward - facing protrusion from the er is low , unless the number density and/or angular size of such plumes is very high .",
    "this question is better addressed by hydrodynamic modeling .",
    "we caution the reader of the preliminary nature of these inferences .",
    "as noted above , values of @xmath37 assume an isotropic expansion at early times , and ignore the unknown cooling time @xmath38 , which roughly dictates when a spot first becomes visible in optical line emission after it has been shocked .",
    "from the shock model presented above , we see that @xmath38 is a strong function of the forward blast velocity , and both the shape and size of the protrusion . at this early stage of hot spot study , all three remain highly uncertain , if not unknown .",
    "while our data suggest the forward blast may travel faster in the western direction , hs  14 - 249 , located between hs  6 - 229  and hs  7 - 289 , does not require an above - average value of @xmath37 to explain its earliest appearance .",
    "thus , many interpretations of the data exist .",
    "the forward blast could be symmetric and fast ( @xmath105 km  s@xmath1 ) , and hs  6 - 229  and hs  7 - 289  lie on protrusions whose geometries yield significantly shorter cooling times ( e.g. cylinders ) than those of most other spots ( e.g. wide cones ) . in keeping with our proposed scenario ,",
    "the geometry of hs  14 - 249  could result in a much longer cooling time than its neighboring two spots , delaying its discovery until after hs  6 - 229  and hs  7 - 289 .",
    "these ambiguous interpretations require a combined observational and computational effort",
    ". continued spectroscopic monitoring of the er and hot spots will yield better estimates of the physical conditions of the pre- and post - shocked gas , which serve as important constraints for numerical modeling .",
    "radiation - hydrodynamic modeling of the shock interaction with a variety of probable protrusion geometries can offer theoretical light curves and flux proper - motion curves against which data ( such as those presented in this paper ) can be compared . as such ,",
    "the conclusions from this work are only preliminary and suggestive , as there is much yet to unfold in this stage of the evolution of snr 1987a .",
    "finally , we note that as of 2001 april , there remain protrusions from the er which do not appear to host hot spots . from figure [ deproj ] , we see that hot spots are expected at rough p.a.s of 5 , 85 , 195 , and 310 . while there is a marginal detection of flux at the latter position in 2001 may , no spots have been detected between p.a . 5090 , and 170220 .",
    "the most recent data show a smear of flux toward pa 90 , suggestive that new spots may be forming in that region , however no significant detection of flux is made between pa 180220 .",
    "the first appearance of spots in this vicinity should prove another interesting measurement of asymmetry in the forward blast .",
    "the analyses of @xcite suggest that the er might have an intrinsic ellipticity with axis ratio 0.95 , based in part on the discrepancy between the observed er geometry and that implied by the interpretation of uv line - emission light curves as fluorescent light echoes off the er @xcite .",
    "measuring the inclination angle @xmath106 of the er from the delay of the uv light echoes , @xcite find @xmath107 .",
    "insertion of our geometric inclination angle @xmath108 into their equation 4.5 also yields an intrinsic ellipticity @xmath109 .",
    "the three - dimensional structure of the hourglass nebula containing the er @xcite has been reanalyzed by a.  p.  s.  crotts ( as reported in * ? ? ? * ) , revealing again an intrinsic flattening of the er of @xmath110 .",
    "the agreement of these two independent measurements is suggestive that the er may have an intrinsic 5% ellipticity .",
    "an ellipse , when inclined from the line of sight , is mapped to a new ellipse , and can always be rotated about orthogonal axes into a circle ( even if that is not its actual shape ) .",
    "we find however that the er deviates somewhat from even an elliptical morphology .",
    "it is unclear at this time what the actual geometry is , however we can envision a number of possibilities .",
    "the ring could also be warped , as noted in ",
    "[ ssec - param ] , or it could have an inherent radial profile that is not a smooth function of p.a . recalling the postulated density enhancement to the east , an axially - symmetric outflow would expand furthest into the lowest density medium .",
    "figure [ deproj ] shows that the er material to the northwest is furthest from the sn , suggestive of this simpler interpretation .    assuming that the er is planar and circular , @xcite calculate the distance to the sn as @xmath111 where @xmath112 are the times of the two cusps of uv line emission around the er following the sn explosion , and @xmath113 is the major axis of the er . using a re - analysis of _ iue _ data yielding @xmath114 days and @xmath115 days , and the geometric data in [ ] from @xcite , gould & uza find a weighted average distance of @xmath116 kpc .",
    "if intrinsic ellipticity of the er is taken into consideration , gould & uza find @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the minor axis of the er , yielding an upper limit distance of @xmath119 kpc .",
    "finally , they consider the case of uv emission arising from the inner edge of the er , and find @xmath120 kpc .",
    "they discount this latter scenario as highly implausible , explaining that ( seen in the uv echo ) has the same ionization potential as ( used to measure the geometric data ) , making it unlikely that their physical distribution is dissimilar .",
    "the success of the gould & uza method relies on the assumption that @xmath121 measures the size of the region from which the uv echo occurred , however the geometric parameters of the er presented in this work and @xcite only measure the size of the optically - emitting region at the time the data were taken .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found in _",
    "imaging that the er is larger in [ ] than in h@xmath4 and [ ] , and @xcite find that the [ ] -emitting er gas has a higher density than that emitting [ ] .",
    "recalling the proposed formation scenario in which the er lies at the waste of a bipolar `` hourglass '' nebula of gas , @xcite offer a simple model in which the [ ] -emitting gas is located within the equatorial plane , while [ ] emission arises from less dense gas along the walls of the hourglass just above or below this plane .",
    "the densest gas cools the most rapidly , hence the [ ] -dominated er seen today should have been dominated by [ ] at earlier times .",
    "given that the [ ] er appeared larger than that in [ ] in 1995 , it is unlikely that the values of @xmath121 from @xcite or this work measure the position of the dense material which fluoresced to produce the observed uv echo .",
    "rather , this component may have had such a high density that it has faded and is `` invisible '' in optical line - emission today .",
    "we propose the following pragmatic distance estimate .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the er (  [ ssec - param ] ) offer upper limits to the location of the uv - emitting region , while the dense inner edge of the er , now well delineated by hot spot activity , serves as a reasonable lower limit . measuring the innermost edge of the er as the average deprojected position of all hot spots , we find @xmath122 , while we take @xmath123 from table [ tbl - geo ] .",
    "assuming the er is planar and circular , we now find a lower distance limit of @xmath2 kpc , and an upper limit of @xmath3 kpc . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite reviews a number of distance determinations to the lmc , finding average values of @xmath6755 kpc from cepheids and around 53.7 kpc from miras and rr lyrae , while a few methods do favor a shorter distance of 4548 kpc , such as that determined via eclipsing binaries .",
    "using red clump stars in _ hst _ fields surrounding the sn , @xcite determine the distance to the lmc to be @xmath124 kpc .",
    "the light echo analyses of @xcite show the sn to be at least  kpc deep into the inclined plane of the lmc , thus the lower distance limit appears inconsistent with these distance indicators .",
    "rather , we find they favor the longer sn distance scale , and thereby suggest that the uv echo did originate along the inner edge of the er , as traced by the positions of the hot spots .",
    "we have shown that a hot spot is present , or appears to be developing , on nearly every inward - protrusion or gradient of increasing flux .",
    "we expect to see spots developing at rough p.a.s of 5 , 85 , 195 , and 310  in the years 2002 - 2003 , with the currently confirmed spots eventually spreading in p.a .  into resolved emission regions .",
    "it is _ abundantly _ clear that hot spot evolution changes on time scales as short as one month , and dramatically within six months . observing campaigns , such as the ground - based ir and stis spectral observations from this work , are mandated to efficiently and completely",
    "monitor this rapidly evolving system . to properly interpret current and future observations of this system , models of optical line profiles and intensities , as well as radiative shock models consistent with the observed hot spot loci and evolution , should be further developed .    as @xcite point out",
    ", it will not be straightforward to develop a quantitative model of line spectra and evolution of hot spots .",
    "it is our hope that the data reported in this work will be combined with that from spectra , yielding detailed information about density and temperature @xcite , and shock velocity @xcite , to provide a solid empirical base on which to build appropriate analytic models to both analyze and predict future evolution .",
    "nonetheless , analytic predictions of the er - ejecta evolution do exist .",
    "of particular interest , @xcite find that the impact should have three periods of brightening , corresponding to the initial impact of the blast wave , the later impact of a reflected shock , and the merging of the two shocks within the ring material . within this framework , we question whether the `` glitch '' from hs  1 - 029  around day 4400 ( and perhaps currently occurring in hs  7 - 289 ) may correspond to the delay between the first two brightening periods . this should be accompanied by an increase in temperature , density and shock velocity from the hot spot , all measurable through spectroscopy . in the meanwhile , only time will more fully `` illuminate '' the er - ejecta evolution .",

    "<S> we present ground - based near - infrared imaging and _ hst _ optical imaging and spectroscopy of the interaction between the ejecta of sn  1987a and its equatorial circumstellar ring . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction has made a transition , from emission originating in just a few `` hot spots '' at restricted locations in position angle around the ring , to a collision producing optical emission over a nearly continuous distribution , with few breaks larger than 45 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the centroids of the first three spots are measured to move at @xmath0 km  s@xmath1 , which we interpret as a lower limit of the velocity of the forward blast front . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength light curves of the spots show that they do not evolve uniformly , and change significantly on timescales as short as one month ; in particular the first spot shows a significant break in its lightcurve . </S>",
    "<S> implications of observed delays between spots appearances are discussed , which leads to a generalized model of hot spot evolution , and suggests that the early appearance of the first hot spot is explained by its inward radial position and a fairly uniform forward blast wave , rather than extraordinary physical circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> data further suggest that the forward blast is reaching the bulk of the inner ring material to the east , the density of which appears higher than elsewhere in the ring . </S>",
    "<S> we study the ring geometry , finding evidence suggestive of an intrinsic ellipticity of 0.95 , and find lower and upper distance limits of @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 kpc , respectively . </S>"
