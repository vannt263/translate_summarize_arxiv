    "symplectic groupoids @xcite are lie groupoids with a compatible symplectic structure . their space of objects is naturally endowed with a poisson structure . in a sense ,",
    "a symplectic groupoid is a good symplectic replacement for the base poisson manifold and is also related to its quantization .",
    "this beautiful picture has one fault : namely , not every poisson manifold arises as the space of objects of a symplectic groupoid .",
    "moreover , the symplectic category is not the correct classical analogue of the category of hilbert spaces which appears in quantum mechanics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to define a more general structure , which we call a relational symplectic groupoid and of which ordinary symplectic groupoids are a particular case , as a ",
    "groupoid object in the extended symplectic category . \"",
    "quotation marks are needed as this as to be interpreted in the correct way .",
    "first , the  extended symplectic category , \" whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms are canonical relations ( i.e. , immersed lagrangian submanifolds in the cartesian product of symplectic manifolds with appropriate sign conventions for the symplectic form ) is not a category since the composition of a canonical relation is not a submanifold in general .",
    "this is however not a problem since in the case at hand we are only interested in morphisms that compose well .",
    "( the situation is actually even subtler since , in order to have particularly interesting examples at hand , we include also infinite dimensional weak symplectic manifolds : the composition of canonical relations may then in general also fail to be lagrangian . )",
    "second , a  groupoid object \" is roughly speaking obtained by replacing maps in the definition of a groupoid by canonical relations .",
    "notice that at this level we only want to use diagrams involving the space of morphisms of the groupoid but not the space of objects , which already in the case of an ordinary symplectic groupoid is not a symplectic manifold but only poisson . on the other hand , in order to have an interesting theory we have to introduce some extra axioms , which are automatically satisfied in the case of an ordinary symplectic groupoid ( and which also have a natural interpretation in terms of a two - dimensional topological field theory ) .    under some extra regularity conditions ",
    "we then speak of a regular relational groupoid  we are able to show that an appropriately defined  space of objects \" naturally carries a poisson structure .",
    "moreover , we show that every poisson manifold arises as the  space of objects \" of a regular relational symplectic groupoid ( even though for the classically nonintegrable poisson manifolds we have to allow for infinite - dimensional relational symplectic groupoids ) .",
    "this integration of every poisson manifold arises from the path space construction stemming from the poisson sigma model @xcite .",
    "finally , there is a natural notion of morphisms ( as structure compatible canonical relations ) and equivalences ( as morphisms whose transpose is also a morphism ) between relational symplectic groupoids .",
    "we show that in the case of a classically integrable poisson manifold the relational symplectic groupoid arising from the path space construction is canonically equivalent to any ordinary symplectic groupoid integrating it .    as a final remark notice @xcite that the axioms for a relational symplectic groupoid make sense also in other categories , e.g. , in the category of hilbert spaces .",
    "this provides a definition of what the quantization of a relational symplectic groupoid should look like .",
    "we plan to return to this problem . from this point of view",
    ", the relational symplectic groupoid approach is more natural than the stacky groupoid approach of @xcite even though , in the nonintegrable case , one has to allow for infinite dimensional manifolds .",
    "moreover , the flexibility we gain by the notion of equivalence might be useful for finding a better candidate for quantization than the ordinary symplectic groupoid as in @xcite .",

    "relational symplectic groupoids are objects in an extension of the usual symplectic category in which the objects are symplectic manifolds and the morphisms are symplectomorphisms .",
    "this extension , which we will denote by @xmath0 , is not exactly a category , since the composition of morphisms is only partially defined ; it corresponds to what in the literature is called a _ categoroid _ @xcite . in this section",
