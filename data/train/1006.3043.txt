    "the universal extra dimension ( ued ) model , proposed by appelquist , cheng and dobrescu @xcite , appears to be one of the popular scenario beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this model assumes that all particles can propagate in the flat extra dimensions and in its minimal version ( mued ) @xcite , there is only one extra dimension @xmath9 compactified on a circle of radius @xmath10 ( @xmath11 symmetry ) .",
    "an additional @xmath12 symmetry , which identifies @xmath9 to @xmath13 is required to get zero mode chiral fermions at low energy .",
    "the @xmath12 symmetry breaks the translational invariance along the @xmath14th dimension and generates two fixed points at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the size of the extra dimension is taken to be small enough so that one can dimensionally reduce the theory and construct the effective 4d lagrangian .",
    "the low energy effective lagrangian contains infinite number of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations ( identified by an integer number n , called the kk number ) for all the fields which are present in the higher dimensional lagrangian .",
    "the zero modes of the kk towers are generally identified with the standard model particles .",
    "on the other hand , there is a particular variant of the ued model , called two universal extra dimension ( 2ued ) model @xcite , where all the sm fields propagate in @xmath17 dimensional space time .",
    "2ued model has some additional attractive features . as an example",
    ", 2ued model can naturally explain the long life time of proton @xcite and more interestingly it predicts that the number of fermion generations should be an integral multiple of three @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of kk - excitations of 2ued model has been studied in great detail in recent times which covers its implications at colliders @xcite , in various low - energy observables @xcite and dark matter / cosmology @xcite . however , in this article , we will only concentrate on the phenomenology of mued model at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "one of the interesting feature of the mued model is the conservation of kk number .",
    "since all particles can propagate in the extra dimension , the momentum along the extra dimension is conserved and it is also quantized because of the compactification of the extra dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the five dimensional momentum conservation is translated into the conservation of kk number in the four dimensions .",
    "however , the presence of two fixed points break the translational symmetry and kk number is not a good quantum number . in principle",
    ", there may exist some operators located at these fixed points and one can expect mixing among different kk states . however , if the localized operators are symmetric under the exchange symmetry , but not the @xmath12 of @xmath18 @xmath13 . ] of the fixed points ,",
    "the conservation of kk number breaks down to the conservation of kk parity defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the kk number .",
    "the conservation of kk parity ensures that @xmath0 particles are always produced in pairs and the lightest @xmath0 particle ( lkp ) must be stable .",
    "it also forbids tree level mued contribution to any sm process .",
    "the situation is analogous to the @xmath10 parity conserving supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "the tree level mued spectrum is extremely degenerate and first excitation of any massless sm particle can be the lkp ( say kk excitation of gluon , photon , neutrino i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 etc . ) .",
    "the radiative corrections @xcite play very important role in determining the mued mass spectrum .",
    "the correction terms can be finite ( bulk correction ) or it may depends on the cut - off of the model @xmath24 ( boundary correction ) .",
    "the cut - off dependence comes from the fact that mued is a higher dimensional model and thus , it is nonrenormalizable .",
    "this model should be treated in the spirit of an effective theory valid upto a scale @xmath25 .",
    "it is shown in the literature @xcite that radiative correction partially removes the degeneracy in the spectrum and in most of the parameter space @xmath0 excitation of hypercharge gauge boson @xmath26 called @xmath22 , @xmath27 @xmath22 and @xmath28 @xmath27 @xmath29 . ]",
    "is the lkp .",
    "the @xmath22 can produce the right amount of cosmological relic density ( consistent with the wmap data ) and turns out to be a good dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "the mass of lkp is approximately @xmath30 and hence , the overclosure of the universe puts an upper bound on @xmath31 1400 gev .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath30 comes from the low energy observables and direct search of new particles at the tevatron .",
    "constraints on @xmath30 from @xmath32 of the muon @xcite , flavour changing neutral currents @xcite , @xmath33 decay @xcite , the @xmath34 parameter @xcite , other electroweak precision tests @xcite , hadron collider studies @xcite imply that @xmath35 gev .",
    "a recent inclusive @xmath36 analysis sets a stronger constraint @xmath37 gev at 95@xmath38 cl @xcite , although it still keeps open a lower value of @xmath30 @xmath5 400 gev at 99@xmath38 cl .",
    "the lower and upper bounds indicate that atleast pair production of @xmath39 excited states are possible at the lhc .",
    "the masses of kk particles are dependent on @xmath24 which has no determined value .",
    "one loop corrected @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 gauge couplings show power law running in the mued model and almost meet at the scale @xmath24= 20 @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "thus , one can take @xmath43 as the cut - off of the model and expect the presence of some new physics above that energy scale .",
    "if we neglect such type of unification , we can extend the value of the cut - off , but at the scale around 40 @xmath30 , @xmath42 coupling becomes nonperturbative .",
    "thus , the cut - off @xmath44 of the mued model should not be taken above 40 and one should use the value of @xmath44 between @xmath45 to 40 .",
    "+ the collider phenomenology of mued model is similar to the @xmath10 parity conserving supersymmetry and it has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , though not with the same level of detail and sophistication as the corresponding signals from supersymmetry @xcite . the crucial feature of these studies is the existence of the stable lkp ( kk parity conservation ) and hence , the missing energy and missing transverse momentum signal at the colliders .",
    "the current bounds allow kk states to be as light as a few hundreds of gev .",
    "such light @xmath0 particles can be pair produced at the lhc and they cascade down to @xmath22 which escapes the detector . like @xmath46 conserving susy , the characteristic signature of mued is leptons plus jets accompanied by missing energy .",
    "the sm particles arising from the decay of kk particles are usually soft .",
    "it is due to the partial degeneracy in the mued spectrum .",
    "the model predictions depend only on the two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "+ one of the cleanest signal for new physics search is the multiple leptons in the final state .",
    "leptonic signals at the lhc with missing energy have been studied in the literature  particularly in the context of susy searches . in the present work",
    ", we also consider leptonic final states and systematically study the capability of lhc with @xmath47 tev in the discovery of mued .",
    "we consider two production is huge and can not be eliminated by choosing proper cuts . ] to four leptons accompanied by jets and missing transverse energy in the final states .",
    "there are two motivations for our present study .",
    "first , most of the phenomenological study on mued was carried out using parton level monte carlo simulations and a more detailed analysis is required at this stage .",
    "the other reason is that people have studied mued model by assuming centre of mass energy of lhc to be equal to 14 tev but , lhc has started its operation with reduced cm energy of 7 tev and it will collect data upto 1fb@xmath48 . it is therefore , useful to recalculate the mued discovery reach of lhc with cm energy @xmath49 tev .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall discuss the production of multileptonic final states in mued model and comment on possible sm backgrounds . in section iii",
    ", we shall define the final states , event selection criteria and explore the discovery reach of the lhc .",
    "finally , section iv summarizes our main results and addresses the possible issues of this work .",
    "leptonic final states are always represented as the most powerful discovery channels at the hadron collider .",
    "the detectors of lhc have the ability to identify the leptons very efficiently within a very wide energy range . in mued model ,",
    "leptonic branching ratios are always favorable and multilepton signals can become competitive to the sm backgrounds .    at the lhc , the dominant production processes of mued are the pair production of @xmath0 kk quarks and kk gluons .",
    "typical mued spectrum shows that the colored kk states are heavier than the electroweak kk particles and @xmath39 gluon @xmath21 is the heaviest .",
    "it can decay to both @xmath0 singlet ( @xmath50 ) and doublet ( @xmath51 ) quarks with almost same branching ratios , although , there is a slight kinematic preference to the singlet channel .",
    "the singlet quark can decay only to @xmath22 and sm quark . on the other hand ,",
    "doublet quarks decay mostly to @xmath52 or @xmath29 ( which are kk excitation of electroweak gauge boson @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "hadronic decay modes of @xmath52 and @xmath29 are closed kinematically and these can decay universally to all @xmath0 doublet lepton flavours ( @xmath55 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath52 decays to @xmath56 or @xmath57 with equal branching ratios .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 can decay only to @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the kk leptons finally decay to @xmath22 and a ordinary ( sm ) lepton .",
    "the @xmath22 will escape the detector because it has no strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "thus , the resulting signature would then be @xmath20 jets + @xmath60 leptons + missing @xmath61 .",
    "the pair production of @xmath0 singlet quarks ( @xmath50 ) lead to 2 jets plus missing energy signature .",
    "multijet with missing energy signal has become a canonical signature for susy search . to reduce the sm background contributions , all such analysis demand that the missing transverse energy must be greater than 200 gev . in the next section",
    ", we shall show that the @xmath3 distribution of mued models is softer and thus , such type of cut will kill the sm backgrounds as well as mued signal .",
    "therefore , the more interesting processes that we can consider are @xmath62 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath0 doublet kk quarks . in this case , the leptons are produced from the cascade decay of @xmath52 and @xmath29 .",
    "the number of lepton may vary from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . at this point ,",
    "let us comment on third generation kk states .",
    "the singlet and doublet kk states are not exactly the mass eigenstates . in the doublet - singlet basis , mass matrix is non - diagonal , and the off - diagonal elements are the zeroth level mass @xmath67 .",
    "we can neglect the sm masses of the quarks and leptons with respect to @xmath30 except for the third generation quarks .",
    "after diagonalisation and a chiral rotation , one gets the proper mass eigenstates called @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in case of kk top quarks ,",
    "the doublet singlet mixing is most prominent .",
    "@xmath70 can decay dominantly to charged kk higgs , and @xmath71 can decay to @xmath52 or @xmath29 . generally the kk top quarks are taken separately in the analysis and it is not included in our results . the decay of doublet b kk quark to sm top and @xmath52 is not allowed kinematically and its main decay mode is sm @xmath72 quark with @xmath0 z boson .",
    "+ at the lhc , one can also have associated production of a @xmath39 kk electroweak gauge boson together with a @xmath39 kk quark . such processes also contribute to the multileptonic final states with low jet multiplicity , but the cross sections are much lower than the strong cross sections . as an example , @xmath73 production cross section is around 5 pb for @xmath30=300 gev and @xmath44=20 at lhc with centre of mass energy 14 tev , whereas strong kk pair production is around 2000 pb .",
    "similarly , the production and decays of the @xmath74 particles result in final states with leptons .",
    "inclusion of all such processes will definitely increase the mued discovery reach at the lhc , but our analysis is restricted to the pair production of strongly interacting kk particles only .",
    "the kk quarks and gluons carry colours and it is needless to mention that their production cross sections are high at the lhc .",
    "the tree level kk number conserving couplings of kk quarks and gluons are similar to sm couplings and there is no @xmath24 or @xmath10 dependence in their couplings .",
    "however , the masses of the kk states are logarithmically cut - off dependent and thus , the kk production cross sections depend mildly on the cut - off . here",
    "we fix the value of @xmath44 equals to 20 and plot the the leading order pair production cross sections of coloured @xmath0 kk states as a function of @xmath30 at the lhc with @xmath2= @xmath49 tev . for completeness",
    ", we also plot the same for lhc with @xmath2=14 tev .",
    "we use cteq5l parton distribution function and the scale of the strong coupling constant is taken to be equal to the parton level center of mass energy . here",
    "we sum over the final state quark flavors and include charge - conjugated contributions .",
    "+ from fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_7_14 ] , we see that at the 7 tev lhc , if @xmath30 is less than 600 gev , @xmath75 cross section is dominant and the cross sections fall off rapidly with @xmath30 .",
    "the cascade decay of @xmath76 events generally produce 3 jets , leptons and missing energy . at the lhc with @xmath47 tev ,",
    "the total mued pair production cross section is about 100 pb for @xmath30=300 gev and it is around 1pb for @xmath30=800 gev corresponding to @xmath77 to @xmath78 events with @xmath79 of luminosity . from this naive result , we may say that even with small amount of data , we can get some hints of kk particles .",
    "the reach of the 14 tev lhc is much higher and a run with moderate luminosity has the capability to probe the entire dark matter allowed region of mued parameter space . again in case of 14 tev lhc , @xmath80 rate is the highest upto @xmath30=1200 gev , above which @xmath0 quark pair production is comparable . it is to be noted that we have used the leading order cross sections from pythia @xcite , but the higher order correction to the mued processes should be significant .",
    "+ we are now in a position to specify the final states used in our analysis . in this part , we shall briefly describe how one can get di - leptons , tri - leptons and four leptons associated with jets and missing transverse momentum in the mued model .",
    "we shall also comment on the possible sm backgrounds . in the sm ,",
    "leptonic final states arise from the decay of @xmath81 boson , top quark or from the semileptonic decay of heavy flavours .",
    "the standard model background processes most relevant to mued searches are @xmath82 , @xmath53 plus jets , @xmath54 plus jets , diboson production etc .",
    "a good understanding of such processes are essential and precise predictions provide a high sensitivity to searches for new phenomena producing multi - leptonic final states .",
    "+     +    * * : we look for an excess over the sm background in a final state that contains exactly equal to two leptons ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) plus jets and significant amount of missing energy .",
    "the leptons can have same or opposite charges . in the mued model ,",
    "the opposite sign di - leptons can be produced from the production of opposite sign doublet quarks ( like @xmath85 @xmath86 production ) and its decay through @xmath87 .",
    "the each @xmath52 can produce one lepton and these two leptons have opposite charges .",
    "the production of @xmath63 and @xmath62 followed by the 2 body decay of kk gluon to doublet kk quarks can also produce two opposite sign doublet quarks .",
    "kk @xmath54 boson is another source of di - leptons .",
    "the same sign di - lepton production mechanism is similar to the opposite sign case . in this case , two same sign doublet quark is needed which can be produced directly or from the @xmath63 and @xmath62 processes .",
    "the same sign doublet quark pair production via the exchange of kk gauge bosons ( mainly @xmath21 ) is the most significant production mechanism .",
    "one can easily estimate the number of di - leptons in the final state from the knowledge of cross sections , because the branchings are quite insensitive to the model parameters of the model .",
    "the osd final state has a higher rate than the ssd final state .",
    "the advantage of ssd over osd signal is that it is almost background free .",
    "the most significant sm background of same sign di - lepton is coming from @xmath82 production followed by the semileptonic decay of @xmath88 pairs . here",
    "the second lepton originates from the semileptonic @xmath72 decay .",
    "the @xmath89 production can also be a dangerous background where the both leptons may come from @xmath72 decay .",
    "the leptons from the decay of @xmath72 quarks are generally soft and non isolated from the associated jets .",
    "therefore , by requiring high @xmath90 leptons and tight isolation criteria one can suppress such background . in addition , diboson production also contributes to the background . in real experiment ,",
    "charge mismeasurement of lepton is also possible .",
    "this can turn an opposite - sign pair into a like - sign pair .",
    "estimate of the sign misidentification rate is necessary and it should be included in the study .",
    "but , we have not done any detector simulation and hence , charge misidentification is neglected . in case of opposite sign di - lepton final state , @xmath54 boson ,",
    "@xmath82 and diboson production are dominant backgrounds . by putting invariant mass cut on the di - leptons , z",
    "boson background can be reduced , but @xmath82 background is irreducible . in mued model ,",
    "the leptons and jets are generally soft and the missing transverse energy distribution is also soft .",
    "so , it is not possible to reduce sm @xmath82 background by applying hard cuts on the final state leptons , jets or missing @xmath61 . + * * next we consider tri - leptonic final state .",
    "isolated tri - lepton signal comes from the cascade production of @xmath91 gauge boson pairs and their leptonic decays . in susy ,",
    "first chargino and second neutralino are lighter than the gluino and squarks , and typically masses of these particles lie in the range 200 - 300 gev .",
    "therefore , chargino neutralino production rate is expected to be high at the lhc .",
    "the production of neutralino chargino pair leads to the hadronically quiet tri - lepton signal which is treated as the golden discovery channel for susy . in case of mued ,",
    "the masses of the @xmath52 or @xmath29 are @xmath5 @xmath30 , therefore , @xmath91 direct pair production cross section is much smaller than the susy chargino neutrlino production rate .",
    "for this reason , one has to consider the cascade decay of kk coloured states to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "thus , in case of mued , tri - lepton signal is usually associated with jets .",
    "the of jets coming from the decay of kk quarks and gluons generally soft and a small fraction of the events may be hadronically quiet . several sm processes can mimic the tri - lepton signature .",
    "the main backgrounds to the tri - leptons are from @xmath82 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 etc .",
    "the backgrounds containing an real @xmath54-boson can be rejected by choosing the invariant mass of the same flavour oppositely charged lepton to be less than 80 gev or more than 100 gev .    * * the four lepton signals originates from the direct or cascade production of a pair of @xmath29 boson via the decay mode @xmath95 , although , the direct production rate is smaller than the cascade production rate .",
    "the dominant sm backgrounds to the four lepton signal are continuum production of @xmath96 @xmath96 , real zz production , heavy flavour production , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and z production associated with heavy flavour .",
    "the cross sections of such processes are generally small and by using proper cuts like lepton isolation , z veto , the backgrounds can be reduced significantly .",
    "the four lepton signal is the smallest among all of the multilepton states in mued .",
    "it should be remembered that leptons coming from the decay of kk electroweak gauge bosons or kk leptons are generally soft . in some cases , it is possible to miss one or two of the four leptons .",
    "we shall now describe our numerical analysis methods and results . in our scan , we vary radius of compactification ( @xmath30 ) from 250 gev to 1000 gev although the upper limit , consistent with the mued dark matter bound , is around 1400 gev .",
    "the reason behind it is that we are trying to discover mued signals at the lhc in the early stages of its operation .",
    "the luminosity is expected to be small and thus , only signals with large cross section will be observed .",
    "the total mued cross section is around 100 fb for @xmath30 @xmath5 1000 gev .",
    "we shall also study the discovery reach as a function of cut - off @xmath24 of the model .",
    "since the value of the cut - off determines the overall splitting among kk particles , we expect that mued search sensitivity will also depend on this parameter .",
    "given the value of @xmath30 and the cut - off one can easily calculate the one loop masses of the kk particles using the formulae given in the ref .",
    "+      in our analysis , we have introduce a set of basic selection criteria to identify electrons , muons , jets and missing transverse energy .",
    "the object selection is described in brief in the following .",
    "the following criteria are used to select a electron / muon candidate :    * the transverse momentum @xmath90 of the electron or muon must be greater than 10 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath99 . *",
    "we require that the leptons be isolated from hadronic activity in the detector . to select isolated electrons",
    "/ muons , we demand that the sum of calorimeter energy within a distance @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 ) around the electron / muon candidate must be less than @xmath45 gev .",
    "* we also use lepton jet isolation cut .",
    "we remove electrons that are found within a distance @xmath102 from the jet .",
    "we also remove all muon candidates fall within a distance @xmath103 from a jet .",
    "jets are reconstructed with the help of the inbuilt pythia cluster routine pycell .",
    "pycell uses a fixed - size cone algorithm for clustering .",
    "we have use a cone radius of @xmath103 .",
    "the following selection criteria are introduced to select a jet candidate .    *",
    "the minimum @xmath90 of a jet is taken to be @xmath104 gev and we also demand @xmath105 . *",
    "since electrons are likely to be reconstructed also as jets , we remove any jet candidate that falls within a distance @xmath100 of a electron candidate .",
    "neutrinos and the @xmath22 escape the detector , leading to significant missing transverse energy .",
    "the missing transverse energy in an event is calculated using calorimeter cell energy and the momentum of the reconstructed muons in the muon spectrometer . in our analysis , we have used the very simplified following definition for the missing transverse energy :    @xmath106    where , the sum goes over all the isolated electrons , muons , the jets .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly study various distributions like missing transverse energy ( @xmath3 ) , hardness of the jets and leptons , jet multiplicity etc .",
    "of the mued model .",
    "we first examine missing transverse energy distribution . in the generic susy search ,",
    "one of the most powerful discriminator of the signal from the sm backgrounds is the missing transverse energy .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that mued production cross section at the lhc is dominated by the @xmath0 kk quarks and gluons which decay through a chain to the lightest kk particle @xmath22 . in the kk parity conserving model , @xmath22 escapes the detector and gives rise to missing transverse energy .",
    "thus @xmath0 particle production is always associated with @xmath3 .",
    "however , since we are considering nearly degenerate kk spectrum , the final state particles will be soft and thus , it is expected that the @xmath3 distribution will be softer than a typical susy @xmath3 distribution .",
    "-20pt    in fig.[fig : misspt ] , we plot normalized @xmath107 distributions for different values of @xmath30 and @xmath44 .",
    "we have presented the distributions for four different signal points , namely , @xmath108 gev .",
    "we also show @xmath3 distribution of sm @xmath109 production .",
    "[ fig : misspt ] shows that , for higher value of @xmath30 and @xmath44 , missing @xmath61 increases due to the partial removal of the degeneracy of the mued mass spectrum . for @xmath30=300 gev and @xmath44 = 40 , the @xmath3 peaks at around 50 gev , and it peaks at 130 gev for @xmath30 = 800 gev and @xmath44=40 . in the standard model , only sources of missing transverse energy are standard model neutrinos .",
    "thus , the major sm backgrounds which offer missing transverse energy are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath110 production .",
    "various other effects like mismeasurement of jet energy , cracks in the detector can also generate sizeable amount of missing transverse energy . in order to estimate the missing energy originated from such effects , one has to understand the detector properly and it will take a good amount of time for detector calibration . in the early stage of lhc run , missing energy may not be measured accurately .",
    "it is a therefore reasonable to study the reach of lhc without using @xmath3 information .",
    "the missing @xmath61 distribution of mued is not much different from sm and thus hard cut on the missing @xmath3 will remove majority of the signal events . in this paper , we have demonstrated two different possibilities , e.g. , ( a ) .",
    "reach of lhc with soft @xmath3 cut , ( b ) .",
    "lhc reach without using missing @xmath61 cut on the signals as well as backgrounds . for better signal significance",
    ", one can optimize the cut on the missing @xmath61 and hardness of the leptons and jets depending on the masses of the kk particles however , no such attempt is made in our analysis .",
    "we next show the @xmath90 distributions of leptons and jets coming from the decay of kk particles .",
    "since we are concentrating only on 2 , 3 and 4-lepton events , we have used all the events with number of lepton @xmath111 2 to numerically evaluate those distributions . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdist ] , we have presented the normalized transverse momentum distributions of ( a ) the hardest jet , ( b ) the second hardest jet , ( c ) the hardest lepton and ( d ) the second hardest lepton . fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdist ] clearly suggests that mued model will give rise to very soft leptons and jets at the lhc .",
    "this is a consequence of nearly degenerate mued mass spectrum .",
    "as we increase the value of @xmath30 or @xmath24 , the mass splitting between different @xmath0 particles increases . therefore , we will have relatively harder leptons and jets for large value of @xmath30 or @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath90 distribution of leptons show that hardest lepton @xmath90 does not exceed 60 gev and we can use a upper cut of 50 gev on the hardest lepton s transverse momentum to reject standard model backgrounds .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : njet ] , we have presented the jet multiplicity distribution of signal events . since we have considered only qcd production channels ( namely , @xmath112 ) , all the events are accompanied by one or more jets .",
    "in fact , more than 79 ( 96)% of the multilepton events for @xmath113 gev and @xmath114 are accompanied by two or more jets .",
    "we can exploit this feature of the signal to reduce the contributions from the sm background process ( like single @xmath115-boson , @xmath116 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 etc .",

    "we have used inbuilt initial and final state radiations ( isr / fsr ) , fragmentation and hadronization routines in the pythia code and we do not consider the effect of multiple interactions .",
    "+      after discussing about the signal and background characteristics , we are now equipped enough to introduce a set event selection criteria which will enhance the signal to background ratio .",
    "we have applied channel independent as well as channel dependent cuts .",
    "we have used b tagging with efficiency @xmath121 to minimize sm top quark backgrounds .",
    "the event selection criteria for different signal topologies under consideration are summarized in the following .",
    "* we demand exactly one pair of leptons with same charge and @xmath122 gev .",
    "we reject events with a third lepton with @xmath122 gev .",
    "* as discussed in the previous section , the softness of the signal leptons can also be utilized to enhance signal to background ratio .",
    "we demand @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 gev where @xmath125 are the hardest and second hardest lepton respectively . *",
    "we require at least two jets with @xmath126 gev .",
    "this cut is very efficient in reducing the contribution from sm background which may have high lepton multiplicity but low jet multiplicity .",
    "* since the sm events are more likely to have lower @xmath3 , a higher bound on the @xmath3 would be very effective against qcd di - jet and @xmath127jets events .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , due to the close degeneracy of the mued mass spectrum , we will not have large @xmath3 for signal events .",
    "therefore , we demand @xmath3 to be greater than @xmath128 gev in all events . *",
    "we require missing @xmath129 where f = 0.2 . * as mentioned earlier , the most dominant sm background process is the @xmath88 production followed by the semi - leptonic decay of one b - quark , leptonic decay of one @xmath53-boson and hadronic decay of the other @xmath53-boson .",
    "@xmath88 contribution can be suppressed by rejecting events with tagged b jets .",
    "therefore , we use b jet veto to minimize the sm top backgrounds .",
    "* we require the presence of exactly two leptons with opposite charge and @xmath130 gev . *",
    "we impose an upper bound of 50 and 30 gev on the transverse momentum of the hardest and second hardest lepton respectively .",
    "* we require the missing @xmath61 to be larger than 50 gev . * at least 2 jets with @xmath90 @xmath131 40 gev . * missing @xmath129 where f = 0.2 .",
    "* we also apply b jet veto to minimize sm top backgrounds . *",
    "we vetoed events exhibiting the same flavour opposite charge lepton pair with an invariant mass smaller than 10 gev and also invariant mass between 80 to 100 gev .",
    "this cut removes both z boson and qed contribution .",
    "* we require the presence of exactly three isolated leptons with @xmath90 greater than 10 gev .",
    "* we demand @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 gev . *",

    "* atleast 2 jets with @xmath133 40 gev .",
    "* we also apply the same invariant mass cut on the opposite sign same flavour leptons and b jet veto as described above .      in this section",
    ", we will concentrate on the discovery potential of mued model at the lhc with centre of mass energy 7 tev where the maximum integrated luminosity is likely to be of the order of 1 to 2 @xmath4 .",
    "the masses of the kk particles scale linearly with @xmath30 and hence , total kk cross section decreases with it .",
    "we choose @xmath30 as one of the scan parameter .",
    "we have chosen @xmath44 as the second scan parameter because it determines the splitting between two kk states .",
    "the determination of @xmath3 crucially depends on the precise knowledge of the detector response .",
    "since fake @xmath3 grows with the total scalar energy in hadron collider events , the knowledge about the detector performance at @xmath137 tev may not be useful .",
    "therefore , at the early stage of lhc with @xmath47 tev , precise information about the @xmath3 may not be available . keeping this in mind , we have divided our analysis into two different categories .",
    "for category-1 , we assume that there will be precise information about @xmath3 .",
    "we use this information to suppress the sm backgrounds . for category-2 , we do not use any information about @xmath3 .",
    "first , we show the discovery reach in the multileptonic channel using the @xmath3 i.e. , category-1 .",
    "we define the signal to be observable for a integrated luminosity @xmath138 if ,    * @xmath139 + where , @xmath140 , is the number of signal ( background ) events for an integrated luminosity @xmath138 .",
    "* for zero number of background event , the signal is observable if there are at least five signal events . * in order to establish the discovery of a small signal ( which could be statistically significant i.e. @xmath141 ) on top of a large background , we need to know the background with exquisite precision",
    ". however , such precise determination of the sm background is beyond the scope of this present article .",
    "therefore , we impose the requirement @xmath142 to avoid such possibilities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_with ] , we have presented the mued discovery potential of the lhc in the multilepton plus @xmath3 channels namely , ( a ) .",
    "same - sign di - lepton , ( b ) .",
    "opposite - sign di - lepton and ( c ) tri - lepton channel .",
    "we have assumed eight different values of integrated luminosity ranging over @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "figure shows the 5 @xmath145 discovery contour in the @xmath30-@xmath44 plane and the lines refer to the different integrated luminosities .    *",
    "[ fig : reach_with ] clearly suggests that for low integrated luminosity osd and tri - lepton channels are most promising . as for example , with @xmath146 integrated luminosity",
    ", one can probe mued parameter space upto @xmath147 gev for @xmath148 in the osd or tri - lepton channel .",
    "whereas , the corresponding discovery reach in ssd channel is @xmath149 gev . *",
    "[ fig : reach_with ] shows that discovery potential in these channels strongly depend on the @xmath44 of the model for low value of @xmath30 and it is almost independent of @xmath44 in case of high value of @xmath30 .",
    "it is also clear from the fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_with ] that probing lower values of the cut - off scale ( @xmath24 ) will be difficult i.e. we require higher integrated luminosity to probe low @xmath44 region .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that lower value cut - off scale will corresponds to more degenerate mued mass spectrum .",
    "if the mass - splitting between different @xmath0 kk states are small , the final state leptons and jets ( arising from the cascade decay of @xmath0 quarks and gluons ) will be very soft and fall out side of the detector acceptance quite often .",
    "therefore , for small @xmath44 , the signal cross - section decreases and we require higher integrated luminosity to probe the region .",
    "this feature can be observed in all the three channels , however , most prominent in the tri - lepton channel .",
    "[ fig : reach_with]c shows that in the tri - lepton channel , one can not probe @xmath150 region with @xmath151 integrated luminosity . since the mass splitting increases with in increasing values of @xmath30 , the sensitivity of @xmath44 decreases for higher values of @xmath30 .",
    "* for high integrated luminosity , osd is the most promising channel and it can probe @xmath30 @xmath5 750 ( 700 ) gev at an integrated luminosity of @xmath152 .",
    "this reach is almost independent of the @xmath44 .",
    "the ssd and tri - lepton channels have less background , but the signal cross sections are also small .",
    "the osd channel , background being an order of magnitude larger , is on the other hand more useful .",
    "hence , the osd channel results may actually be the most important for the early searches .    as stated earlier",
    ", the understanding of the nature of the @xmath1 will be crucial in the early search for new physics at the lhc . at the early stage of lhc , estimation and the rejection of the background from physics processes with no real intrinsic transverse missing energy",
    "is more challenging because the measured @xmath3 would not reflect the one originating from the non - interacting particles .",
    "for this reason , we have carried out the same analysis without considering the @xmath3 cut . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_without ] , we present the discovery reach of mued model without using @xmath3 gev and @xmath153 cuts . ] .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution of this model is soft ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : misspt ] ) and therefore , it is expected that inclusion of @xmath3 can not change the reach significantly .",
    "this feature is in contradiction with most of the supersymmetric models . in a recent study @xcite , it was shown in the context of minimal supergravity model that use of @xmath3 cut will enhance the lhc",
    "reach significantly . however , in our case , if we do not use the @xmath3 cuts , the reach of @xmath30 slightly reduced except in the tri - lepton channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_without ] ) .    here also , for low integrated luminosity , osd and tri - lepton channels are most promising .",
    "however , for high integrated luminosity , tri - lepton is the most promising channel because of the low sm background . as for example , with @xmath144 integrated luminosity",
    ", mued parameter space can be probed upto @xmath154 gev for @xmath155 in the tri - lepton channel .",
    "however , in the ssd and osd channel the discovery reach is @xmath156 gev respectively for @xmath155 . as we increase @xmath30 , the total pair production cross - section of @xmath157 decreases ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cross_7_14 ] ) and hence , the signal cross - section decreases . in defining the observability of the signal",
    ", we have demanded that @xmath158 .",
    "the sm background for the osd channel is quite large .",
    "therefore , we can not probe @xmath30 beyond @xmath159 gev in the osd channel by increasing integrated luminosity .",
    "here we do not show the discovery reach in the 4 lepton channel separately because the 4 lepton cross section is much smaller than other three processes considered here . as for example",
    ", we obtain 4-lepton cross - section ( with the @xmath3 cuts ) of 3.21 ( 1.69 ) fb for @xmath160 gev and @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , we have not found atleast 5 events in most of the parameter space points .",
    "it is possible to combine the significance of these channels but no such attempt has made in our paper .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the early discovery signals of minimal ued model at the large hadron collider with center of mass energy 7 tev and integrated luminosity 1fb@xmath48 .",
    "we have considered signals with two or more leptons in the final state and we have calculated the discovery reach in each of the final states .",
    "the results of our work indicates that lhc can discover the signals of mued if @xmath30 is less than 700 gev .",
    "the opposite sign di - lepton channel is the most promising one .",
    "we have seen that the inclusion of missing energy does not change the discovery limit drastically .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath3 distribution of mued model has the similar shape as the sm backgrounds .",
    "it should be stressed that our cuts are very simple and reach may be improved by imposing more specific cuts . in summary",
    ", we can say that early lhc data has substantial reach within the mued parameter space .    * acknowledgement *",

    "<S> universal extra dimension ( ued ) model is one of the popular extension of the standard model ( sm ) which offers interesting phenomenology . in the minimal ued ( mued ) model , kaluza - klein ( kk ) parity conservation ensures that @xmath0 kk states can only be pair produced at colliders and the lightest kk particle is stable . in most of the parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> first kk excitation of sm hypercharge gauge boson is the lightest one and it can be a viable dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the decay of @xmath0 kk particles will always involve missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) as well as leptons and jets . </S>",
    "<S> the production cross sections of @xmath0 kk particles are large and such particles may be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the mued discovery potential of the lhc with @xmath2 = 7 tev in the multileptonic final states . </S>",
    "<S> since in the early lhc run , precise determination of @xmath3 may not be possible , we examine the lhc reach with and without using @xmath1 information . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that @xmath1 cut will not improve mued discovery reach significantly . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that opposite sign di - lepton channel is the most promising discovery mode and with first @xmath4 of collected luminosity , lhc will be able to discover the strongly interacting @xmath0 kk particles with masses upto 800 @xmath5 900 gev .    ` </S>",
