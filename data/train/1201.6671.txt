[ dqim_qpt]*(b ) * ) , we find that @xmath346 , leading to a disordered linear paramagnet , whereas @xmath347 yields the ordered zigzag antiferromagnet .",
    "hence the spin - peierls transition is triggered by quantum fluctuations alone ( i.e. spin - peierls quantum phase transition ) , as outlined in the scheme of fig .  1 in the main text .      in order to assess the scope and utility of the proposed quantum simulator , we discuss in detail some of the experimental and theoretical efforts to understand the spin - peierls instability in the context of quantum many - body physics .    _",
    "experimental perspective. _ the first experimental evidence of the spin - peierls instability was found in the organic molecular crystal ttf - cus@xmath348c@xmath348(cf@xmath349)@xmath348",
    ". there , unpaired spins @xmath350 localized at neighboring donor ions ttf@xmath351 interact via super - exchange through the acceptor cus@xmath348c@xmath348(cf@xmath349)@xmath348 , and give rise to an alternating antiferromagnetic heisenberg model that depends on the lattice dimerization .",
    "the opening of the spin - peierls gap was inferred from the sharp isotropic decrease of the magnetic susceptibility below @xmath352k  @xcite , and from an anomaly in the magnetic contribution to the specific heat  @xcite . besides , the associated dimerization of the lattice was directly inferred from x - ray measurements of new bragg peaks  @xcite , the intensity of which gave evidence for the condensation of a soft phonon mode . finally , the clear - cut confirmation of the magnetic origin of the structural phase transition was obtained by applying an additional magnetic field . in the low - field regime , neutron scattering experiments displayed a shift of the critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "additionally , magnetization measurements showed that a new phase transition takes place in the high - field regime  @xcite , and leads to an incommensurate lattice distortion .",
    "let us finally note that spin - peierls transitions were also observed for other organic materials , such as ttf - aus@xmath348c@xmath348(cf@xmath349)@xmath348 ( @xmath353k )  @xcite , and mem-(tcnq)@xmath354 , which displayed both an electronic peierls transition ( @xmath355335k ) and a spin - peierls instability ( @xmath35518k )  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a spin - peierls phase transition in cugeo@xmath356 ( @xmath35514k )  @xcite , an inorganic compound , paved the way to new experiments due to the availability of larger crystals with a higher quality . in this case , the spins @xmath350 of localized electrons in the cu@xmath357 ions interact via super - exchange through the o@xmath358 ions , and also lead to an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model that depends on the lattice dimerization . hence",
    ", similar effects were observed in the experiments , such as the drop of the magnetic susceptibility  @xcite , dependence on additional magnetic fields  @xcite , or x - ray and neutron scattering measurements of the secondary bragg peaks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this new material allowed for new possibilities , such as the measurement of the spin - peierls gap and the low - energy dispersion relations via inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite , or the accurate estimation of the modified lattice constants by neutron diffraction  @xcite .",
    "let us remark that no evidence of the soft - phonon condensation was found in these experiments .",
    "another difference with respect to the organic compounds is the presence of magnetic frustration in the underlying heisenberg model , which is based on the analysis of magnetic susceptibility  @xcite and magnetostriction experiments  @xcite .",
    "let us finally note that other inorganic materials , such as the transition metal oxide tiocl  @xcite , have also shown clear evidence of an underlying spin - peierls transition .",
    "this material , which was originally proposed to realized a resonating valence bond state , has turned out to be another example of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg magnet that displays a spin - peierls transition at a much higher temperature @xmath359k .",
    "having described these seminal experiments , it is now possible to understand the interest of the proposed quantum simulator from a experimental perspective .",
    "first , we note that all of the above spin - peierls instabilities occur at a finite temperature @xmath360 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the observation of a spin - peierls transition only driven by quantum fluctuations is still an open problem , which could be addressed with the proposed quantum simulator .",
    "second , we also note that the above transitions are well described by an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "hence , another open problem is the observation of spin - peierls phenomena for materials described by other microscopic models .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetic interaction in the above materials is determined by a super - exchange that can not be experimentally controlled . in contrast",
    ", our quantum simulator would allow for the possibility of tailoring the magnetic interactions experimentally .",
    "although we have considered an ising - type coupling , we emphasize that different models could also be explored by exploiting other laser - induced spin - phonon couplings .",
    "third , an additional property of the trapped - ion quantum simulator is the capability of performing very accurate measurements at the single - particle level . in comparison to the global measurements in the above experiments",
    ", trapped - ion technologies would allow for direct measurements of the local magnetization , or the distance dependence of two - spin correlators .",
    "besides , the crystal structure , and thus the onset of the lattice dimerization , can be directly imaged on ccd cameras .",
    "finally , the possibility of controlling the number of ions would allow for a very interesting transition from the few- to the many - body scenario .",
    "_ theoretical perspective. _ the first theoretical work on the spin - peierls instability  @xcite conjectured the onset of a structural phase transition in molecular crystals , which would be caused by collective magnetic interactions .",
    "this was followed by the first attempts towards a microscopic theory , both for the alternating heisenberg  @xcite and xy  @xcite magnets . in the latter",
    ", the spin model can be mapped onto free spinless fermions , and thus connected with previous work on the fermionic peierls transition ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the alternating heisenberg model  @xcite was initially treated within mean - field theory ( i.e. hartree - fock approximation ) , such that the results of the xy model could be used after a simple renormalization of the spin - spin interaction strength . in particular , this mean - field theory predicts the sharp decrease of the magnetic susceptibility below @xmath361 , and was used satisfactorily to explain the experimental results on the organic crystals described above .",
    "the surprising accuracy of the mean - field predictions could only be understood in the light of the luttinger - liquid treatment  @xcite , which predicted only small corrections for the measured macroscopic quantities , with the possible exception of the experiments with strong magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the challenge to theoretical theories beyond the mean - field treatment changed considerably with the discovery of the inorganic spin - peierls sample cugeo@xmath349 .",
    "first , the underlying microscopic model must incorporate a certain amount of frustration caused by next - to - nearest neighbor interactions  @xcite .",
    "we note that the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations is responsible for a complex phase diagram already for the bare spin model  @xcite . in the complete spin - phonon system ,",
    "the spin - peierls instability and the frustration constitute two different mechanisms for opening an energy gap , which lead to two different types of phase transitions ( i.e. second order and kosterlitz - thouless , respectively ) .",
    "second , the lack of experimental evidence supporting a soft - phonon mode questions the validity of the so - called adiabatic approximation for the crystal vibrations . in most of the theoretical approaches",
    "above , the lattice dynamics is neglected by only considering a static elastic distortion .",
    "some of the first attempts to account for the lattice dynamics considered the opposite diabatic limit  @xcite , where the phonons , which are much faster than the spin excitations in this regime , contribute to a phonon - mediated interaction .",
    "in fact , this mechanism can be also responsible for the long - range frustrating interactions found in cugeo@xmath349 .",
    "let us note , however , that the spin - spin coupling in this material has roughly the same order of magnitude as the phonon frequency , which seems to point out to a regime which is neither adiabatic nor diabatic . in this regime , one must resort to numerical tools , such as optimized exact diagonalization  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group algorithms  @xcite , or quantum monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "these numerical results showed that the non - adiabaticity leads to important renormalization of the spin - peierls gap and the lattice dimerization with respect to the static theories .",
    "more importantly , it can also destabilize the spin - peierls phase for strong - enough spin - phonon couplings via a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "after this description , we can now discuss the interest of the proposed quantum simulator from a theoretical point of view .",
    "first , the trapped - ion setup is an excellent playground where to study strong deviations from mean - field theories .",
    "second , the quantum simulator incorporates naturally the effects of magnetic frustration , since the spin interactions develop a dipolar long - range .",
    "we note that the degree of frustration , namely the ratio between nearest and next - to - nearest couplings , could be tailored by slightly tilting the laser beams in such a way that the effective wavevector also has a component along the axis of the chain .",
    "hence , the interplay of quantum fluctuations and frustration can de actively designed in the quantum simulator .",
    "finally , and most notably , the degree of adiabaticity can also be controlled .",
    "we have focused on a setting where the trapping frequencies lie close to the critical point of the structural transition . in this regime ,",
    "the frequency of the soft - phonon mode lies below the effective spin - coupling strengths , and the adiabatic approximation holds .",
    "however , the quantum simulator could in principle also explore the diabatic regime and the intermediate one by simply changing the trap frequencies . from our point of view , this is a very important property of the quantum simulator , since analytical approaches do not exist in the intermediate regime . besides , numerical methods may even lead to some controversy when the dispersion of the phonon modes is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that the efficiency of the numerical methods is likely to get degraded when the @xmath58 non - linearities are considered .",
    "a priori , the proposed spin - peierls quantum simulator has the potential of exceeding the power of numerical methods on classical computers , which should be the final goal of any sensible quantum simulator .",

    "<S> the spin - peierls instability describes a structural transition of a crystal due to strong magnetic interactions . </S>",

    "<S> this field , which was originally devoted to the study of light - matter interactions at the scale of a single or few atoms , is progressively focusing on the many - body regime in platforms such as neutral atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , cold coulomb crystals of trapped ions  @xcite , or coupled cavity arrays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of experimentally designing the microscopic hamiltonians in order to target a variety of complicated many - body models introduces a novel approach to explore qmbs in a controlled fashion , the so - called _ quantum simulations _ ( qss )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some remarkable qss in amo platforms are the optical - lattice realization of mott  @xcite and anderson  @xcite insulators , and the recent efforts towards a quantum - hall insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more specific to the subject of this manuscript is the qs of quantum magnetism in trapped ions  @xcite , and more recently in optical lattices  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the capabilities of amo setups for the qs of interaction - mediated instabilities in qmbs . </S>",
    "<S> the standard playground for these phenomena is the so - called metal - insulator transition  @xcite , which has been investigated for a variety of transition - metal compounds in the field of strongly - correlated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic case is the one - dimensional metal , where either the electron - electron interactions destabilize the metal towards a superconducting state , or the electron - phonon coupling leads to a charge - density - wave condensate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter instability is a consequence of the so - called _ peierls transition _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the electron - phonon interactions induce a periodic distortion of the ionic lattice , and open an energy gap in the conduction band of the metal . by virtue of the jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite </S>",

    "<S> this creates an alternating pattern of weak and strong spin interactions , which in turn opens an energy gap in the spectrum of collective excitations . </S>",

    "<S> , the spin - peierls instabilities observed so far  @xcite take place at finite temperatures , and are limited to the so - called heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the possibility of realizing a spin - peierls transition only driven by quantum fluctuations , and possibly exploring different types of magnetic interactions , remains as an experimental challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> we hereby present a theoretical proposal for a trapped - ion qs to tackle both problems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , by building on the recent experiments  @xcite on the quantum ising model ( qim )  @xcite , we describe how to tailor a spin - peierls instability . </S>",
    "<S> we show that _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ the disordered paramagnet in a linear ion chain changes into an ordered antiferromagnet in a zigzag crystal [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( ii ) _ the spin - peierls transition can be driven only by the quantum fluctuations introduced by the transverse field of the qim . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that , in comparison to neutral atoms in optical lattices or coupled arrays of cavities , trapped ions seem to be the best candidates to realize the spin - peierls quantum simulator . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main reasons is that the underlying lattice is not externally fixed , but rather results from the self - assembling dynamics of the ions .    _ the system. _ the advent of experimental techniques for the confinement , cooling , and coherent manipulation of atomic ions has recently been exploited for qs purposes  @xcite , where the controlled increase of the number of trapped ions yields a genuine bottom - up approach to the many - body regime . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a coulomb gas formed by an ensemble of @xmath8 trapped ions of mass @xmath9 , and charge @xmath10 , which are described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the effective trapping frequencies of a linear paul trap . here , @xmath13 is the energy difference between two electronic groundstates of the atomic structure @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian must be complemented by the laser - ion interaction responsible for coupling the electronic and the motional degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a pair of laser beams with frequencies @xmath17 , wavevectors @xmath18 , and phases @xmath19 , which are tuned close to the atomic transition . in the dipolar approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the laser - ion hamiltonian becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the rabi frequency of the transition , and we have introduced the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath22 . to proceed further </S>",
    "<S> , we need to make some assumptions about the dynamics of this atomic plasma .    as evidenced in early experiments  @xcite , a laser - cooled ensemble of ions self - assembles in a coulomb crystal , which undergoes a series of structural phase transitions ( spts ) as the trapping conditions are modified . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath23 and the ratio @xmath24 is tuned across a critical value @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the geometry of the crystal changes from a linear string to a zigzag ladder . </S>",
    "<S> note that this spt displays a rich phenomenology that has recently revived the interest in the subject  @xcite . here , we focus on the linear regime close to the critical point @xmath26 , where the vibrations of the ions along each of the confining axes are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the laser wavevectors in   lie within the @xmath7-plane [ fig .  [ spin_peierls_scheme]*(c ) * ] , @xmath27 , such that their frequencies are tuned close to the resonance of the vibrational sidebands @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> since these correspond to the strongly - confining @xmath29-axis , @xmath30 , the coupling of the laser beams to the @xmath4 and @xmath1 vibrational modes becomes far off - resonant and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that this argument has one possible exception , there might be a vibrational soft mode where the phonons condense at the spt . </S>",
    "<S> as identified in  @xcite , this corresponds precisely to the zigzag mode along the @xmath4-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this affects the laser - ion coupling   regardless of the soft - mode frequency ( see supplementary material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations allow us to extract the relevant part of the hamiltonian   after introducing @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are the equilibrium positions in units of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the small displacements along the corresponding axes . following  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the displacements along the @xmath4-axis have been adapted to the aforementioned zigzag mode @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 is a smooth function that allows a gradient expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and we have introduced the gradient @xmath39 . in these expressions , the coupling energies for the vibrations are @xmath40 along the @xmath4-axis , expressed in terms of the inhomogeneous function @xmath41^{n-1}|\\tilde{z}_i^0-\\tilde{z}_l^0|^{-n}$ ] with @xmath42 , and the kronecker delta @xmath43 . in the limit of tight confinement along the @xmath29-axis , @xmath44 , we find @xmath45 accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath46 corresponds to a set of dipolarly - coupled harmonic oscillators , whereas @xmath47 describes a set of nearest - neighbor - coupled anharmonic oscillators .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupled harmonic oscillators   are diagonalized yielding a set of collective modes with frequencies @xmath48 , whose excitations , created and annihilated by @xmath49 , shall be referred to as the _ hard phonons_. this yields the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath50 . by setting the laser frequencies to the red and blue vibrational sidebands of the atomic transition , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we can express the laser - ion interaction   as follows ( see supplementary material ) @xmath53 where we have introduced the sideband coupling strengths @xmath54 , the collective lamb - dicke parameters @xmath55 , the normal - mode vibrational amplitudes @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the anharmonic oscillators   correspond to an inhomogeneous version of the @xmath58 model on a lattice , namely , an interacting scalar field theory that can not be exactly diagonalized . </S>",
    "<S> this model yields a spt that can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the regime @xmath59 , @xmath60 corresponding to trapping - frequency ratios fulfilling @xmath61 , yields the linear ion configuration , which respects the @xmath62 symmetry of the model . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when @xmath63 , @xmath60 for @xmath64 , the ions self - organize in the the zigzag ladder corresponding to the broken - symmetry phase , whereby @xmath65 signals the condensation of the _ soft phonons _ in the zigzag mode . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the @xmath58 model fulfills @xmath66 , which leads to an inhomogeneous spt setting at the center of the trap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as outlined previously , when the soft phonons condense @xmath67 , there is a non - trivial effect in the laser - ion hamiltonian   that must be considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show below that , in this case , the hard phonons mediate a spin - spin interaction , whereas the soft condensed phonons are responsible for a dimerization of the coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be the key ingredient for a zero - temperature spin - peierls transition . </S>",
    "<S> let us also emphasize that this model , which is a cornerstone in the microscopic description of spts  @xcite , has not been combined with a spin - peierls distortion to the best of our knowledge .    </S>",
    "<S> _ dimerized quantum spin model. _ the spin - phonon model in   and   yields an extremely complex qmbs . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the onset of a spin - peierls quantum phase transition by performing a series of simplifications . </S>",
    "<S> first , we neglect the time - dependence of the zigzag distortion  . this adiabatic approximation , which is standard in the treatment of spin - peierls phenomena  @xcite , is justified if the zigzag mode is much slower than the effective spin dynamics , which is valid close to the critical point . hence , we treat the spt classically by setting @xmath68 self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider a homogeneous zigzag distortion , which amounts to neglecting the nearest - neighbor couplings in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> third , when the coupling of the spins to the hard phonons   is weak , they can be integrated out yielding an effective quantum spin model . in the linear string , this leads to a dipolar version of the celebrated qim  @xcite , whereas the frustrated @xmath69-@xmath70 qim arises in the zigzag configuration  @xcite . in this work , we show that in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath71 , the quantum spin model corresponds to a dipolar qim with additional spin - spin couplings whose sign alternates periodically when the soft phonons condense .    in analogy to the s@xmath72rensen - m@xmath72lmer gates  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we consider that the red- and blue - sideband terms   have opposite detunings @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . besides , their rabi frequencies fulfill @xmath76 , and attain values such that @xmath77 . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the sidebands   create a virtual hard phonon which is then reabsorbed by a distant ion , leading thus to the aforementioned effective spin - spin interaction . the above constraints are responsible for the destructive interference of the processes where a phonon is created and then reabsorbed by the same ion , a crucial property that underlies the availability of an effective spin hamiltonian that is decoupled from the hard phonons . finally , by considering that the pair of laser beams are counter - propagating @xmath78 , which implies that the parameters are @xmath79 , it is possible to obtain the following spin hamiltonian ( see supplementary material ) @xmath80 where the coupling strengths are the following @xmath81 and we have introduced the relative phase between the lasers @xmath82 . here , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - spin coupling strengths are @xmath83 where we made a expansion for @xmath84 , and introduced the bare detuning @xmath85 , the bare lamb - dicke parameter @xmath86 , and the common rabi frequency @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the spin - phonon interaction leads to a generalization of the famous xy quantum spin model  @xcite . in order to obtain the promised dimerized spin model </S>",
    "<S> , one has to phase - lock the laser beams @xmath88 , and consider the critical region where the zigzag distortion is small enough @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can taylor expand and obtain an antiferromagnetic ising interaction characterized by @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , but also @xmath92 which give rise to the quantum dimerization ( i.e. a magnetic interaction that does not commute with the ising coupling , and alternates between a ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic sign @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we also consider a transverse field @xmath94 that can be obtained from a microwave that is far off - resonant with respect to the atomic transition . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the spin hamiltonian becomes @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and we have introduced @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that the couplings of the dimerization hamiltonian depend on the condensation of the soft phonons @xmath98 , which is in turn described by the @xmath58 theory . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show how this model leads to the desired spin - peierls instability .        </S>",
    "<S> _ spin - peierls quantum phase transition. _ to demonstrate that the introduced scheme yields a qs of the spin - peierls instability , we simplify the model by neglecting its long - range interactions and inhomogeneities . the spin model can be solved by means of a jordan - wigner transformation after setting @xmath99 , which is later used as input to the @xmath58 model self - consistently . in the limit @xmath100 , the groundstate energy fulfills @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath103 , and we have introduced a monotonically - decreasing positive - definite function @xmath104 that depends on the complete elliptic integrals ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared this expression to numerical dmrg  @xcite calculations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spin_peierls]*(a ) * and supplementary material ) , which support our claim for small dimerizations . </S>",
    "<S> the above lowering of the groundstate energy pinpoints the instability towards the lattice distortion . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the spectrum of magnetic excitations displays the following energy gap @xmath105 . with respect to the paramagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition of the standard qim at @xmath106  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the dimerization breaks the self - duality of the model and allows the critical point to flow towards higher values @xmath107 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spin_peierls]*(b ) * , we obtain the critical point from the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath108 , which clearly shows that the critical point @xmath106 flows towards higher values @xmath109 as the dimerization increases </S>",
    "<S> .    therefore , the disordered paramagnet close to criticality @xmath110 will be unstable towards the ordered antiferromagnet if the lowering of the energy   compensates the structural change . for self - consistency , </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate this energy change in the @xmath58 model . by noticing that it fulfills @xmath111 , </S>",
    "<S> it becomes clear how to modify the parameters of the scalar field theory  . </S>",
    "<S> in analogy to the magnetic quantum phase transition , the critical value of the spt is also displaced , but this time towards a smaller value @xmath112 therefore , the linear ion string close to criticality @xmath113 is unstable towards the symmetry - broken zigzag phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus proved our claim _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ that the paramagnetic phase in the linear ion string will be unstable towards the antiferromagnetic zigzag ladder [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spin_peierls_scheme ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by fixing the ratio of the trapping frequencies in the linear regime , @xmath114 , we can drive both the structural and the magnetic phase transitions by only modifying the transverse magnetic field @xmath115 across @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary condition is that the trapping frequencies are tuned according to the following expression @xmath117 hence , the zigzag antiferromagnet @xmath2 is driven onto a linear paramagnet by increasing the quantum fluctuations @xmath0 ( and vice versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports our claim _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ that the spin - peierls transition can be driven by quantum fluctuations alone .    _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental considerations. _ we focus on @xmath118 and select two hyperfine levels for the spin states @xmath119 , such that the resonance frequency in   is @xmath120 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a @xmath121 ion register with trapping frequencies @xmath122 khz , @xmath123 mhz , and @xmath124 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - locked laser beams leading to   are blue - detuned @xmath1251 mhz , such that the two - photon rabi frequencies are @xmath126 mhz , and the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath127 . with these values , </S>",
    "<S> the required constraints detailed in the supplementary material are fulfilled , and we obtain a nearest - neighbor spin coupling with the typical strength @xmath128 observed in experiments  @xcite . by considering these parameters , the condition   imposes the following constraint over the anisotropy @xmath129 , which requires to be sufficiently close to the structural phase transition . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , the soft radial trapping frequency must be controlled with an accuracy of @xmath1301 - 10 hz , which coincides with the the precision required to observe quantum effects in the spt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> provided that this precision is achieved in the experiments , one could optically pump the linear ion register to @xmath131 , and then study its adiabatic evolution towards the af phase as the transverse field @xmath132 is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding af order can be measured by fluorescence techniques , whereas the structural phase transition could be directly observed in a ccd camera , or inferred from spectroscopy of the vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> a simpler experiment would require to set the the anisotropy parameter within the instability regime given by the displacements in eqs .   and , which leads to @xmath133 and @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear paramagnet would be directly unstable towards to zigzag af without the need of adiabatically tuning the transverse field @xmath132 , and the demanding accuracy over the trap frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook. _ a sensible qs must address questions that are difficult to assess by other analytical or numerical methods . in this work , we have proposed a trapped - ion qs that fulfills this requirement . in particular , in the regime where non - adiabatic effects of the zigzag distortion become relevant , the complexity of the many - body model in eqs .   and   compromises the efficiency of existing numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this qs may address the effects of the inhomogeneities , the long - range dipolar tail of the spin - spin interactions , and the dynamics across such a magnetic structural quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the incorporation of all these effects make our qs of the utmost interest , which may also find an application in the context of other wigner crystals  @xcite , such as electrons in quantum wires or liquid helium .    _ </S>",
