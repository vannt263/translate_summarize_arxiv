    "of the known ionospheric irregularities of a different class , mid - latitude isolated ionospheric disturbances ( iids ) stand out as a highly unusual type .",
    "the past 40 years saw a consistent interest in the study of the origin of iids that was aroused due to difficulties in determining an adequate mechanism for iid generation in mid - latitudes , as well as by the fact that the iid have a marked effect on amplitude and phase characteristics of transionospheric signals from radio engineering communication and navigation systems ( afraimovich et al . , 1992 ) by causing serious malfunctions of these systems .    a large number of publications ( e.g. , karasawa , 1985 ; titheridge , 1971 ) , including a review by bowman ( 1989 ) were devoted to the study along this line .",
    "iids are detected when recording amplitude and phase scintillations of transionospheric radio signals in the form of rarely occurring single aperiodic negative impulses with a duration from a few to several tens of seconds ( karasawa , 1985 ) . to name",
    "this uncommon type of scintillation karasawa ( 1985 ) seems to be the first to coin the term `` spikes - type '' ( s- ) scintillations .",
    "karasawa et al . ( 1985 ) noticed from a long - term recording of the signal from the geostationary marisat satellite at 1.5 ghz frequency that synchronous with amplitude s - scintillations , there occur similar - appearing changes of the rotation angle of polarization plane that are proportional to a corresponding disturbance of total electron content ( tec ) .",
    "anomalous fluctuations , recorded during 13 months of observation , occur predominantly in the night - time and last from 5 s to 2 min .",
    "the diurnal dependence of the s - type oscillations shows two distinct peaks : 09:00 - 15:00 in the daytime , and 20:00 - 01:00 at night .",
    "as far as the seasonal dependence is concerned , however , a maximum of the oscillation distribution corresponds to early summer ( june ) .",
    "it is customary to associate the occurrence of s - type oscillations with diffraction or interference from small - scale irregularities , `` blobs '' and `` bubbles '' , generated in the ionosphere .",
    "titheridge ( 1971 ) found that amplitude and phase s - scintillations are caused by refraction and diffraction effects at the propagation of the transionospheric signal in a medium with iids and presented the corresponding formulae for estimating these effects as a function of relationship of the wavelength of the radio wave , the irregularity size and the sounding geometry ( los to the satellite and the distance to the layer with iids ) .",
    "however , in spite of the many years of experimental and theoretical investigations , there is as yet no clear understanding not only of the physical nature of iids but even of their morphology ( the occurrence frequency as a function of geographical position , time , level of geomagnetic and meteorological activity , etc . ) .",
    "to tackle these questions requires statistically significant sets of experimental data with good spatial and temporal resolution in order to gain insight into not only morphological but also dynamic iid characteristics : the direction of travel , the propagation velocity , and the location of the possible disturbance source .",
    "another important requirement implies a continuity and global coverage of observations since such phenomena are relatively rare in time and random in space .",
    "such an opportunity is for the first time provided by the use of the international ground - based network of two - frequency receivers of the gps , consisting of no less than 1000 sites as of the beginning of 2002 and posting its data on the internet , which open up new avenues for a global , continuous , fully computerized monitoring of ionospheric disturbances of a different class .",
    "analysis and detection of iids was made possible through the use of the technology for global detection and determination of parameters of ionospheric disturbances of a different class that was developed at the istp ( afraimovich , 2000b ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the morphology and spatial and temporal properties of iids using data from a global network of gps receivers . following karasawa et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , the term tecs ( total electron content spikes ) will be used here to designate the iid - induced tec disturbances .",
    "the sample statistic of the occurrence frequency and morphology used in this study does refer to tecs recorded from gps data . within the framework of certain model representations , using these data it is possible to reconstruct amplitude and spatial characteristics of local electron density disturbances , i.e. of iids themselves . on this basis , the term iids will be used below interchangeably with the term tecs .",
    "section 2 describes the method for detecting the tecs obtained in our study .",
    "section 3 presents the tecs morphology .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal properties of iids by considering the most pronounced manifestation of tecs on october 5 , 2001 in california , usa .",
    "the discussion of results compared with findings reported by other authors is presented in section 5 .    our comparison of iid characteristics with geomagnetic field variations used data from near - lying magnetic variation stations of the intermagnet network ( address : http://www.intermagnet.org ) .",
    "the standart gps technology provides a means for wave disturbances detecion based on phase measurements of tec at each of spaced two - frequency gps receivers ( hofmann - wellenhof et .",
    "al , 1992 ) :    @xmath1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the phase delay in the ionosphere ,  ( m ) ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the number of phase rotations at the frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the corresponding wavelengths ,  ( m ) ; @xmath10 is the unknown initial phase ambiguity ,  ( m ) ; and @xmath11   are errors in determining the phase path ,  ( m ) .    phase measurements in the gps can be made with a high degree of accuracy corresponding to the error of tec determination of at least @xmath12  m@xmath13 when averaged on a 30-second time interval , with some uncertainty of the initial value of tec , however ( hofmann - wellenhof et .",
    "al , 1992 ) .",
    "this makes possible detecting ionization irregularities and wave processes in the ionosphere over a wide range of amplitudes ( up to @xmath14 of the diurnal tec variation ) and periods ( from 24 hours to 5 min ) .",
    "the unit of tec @xmath15 , which is equal to @xmath16  m@xmath13   and is commonly accepted in the literature , will be used in the following .",
    "primary data include series of `` oblique '' values of tec @xmath17 , as well as the corresponding series of elevations @xmath18 and azimuths @xmath19 of the los to the satellite calculated using our developed convtec program which converts the gps system standard rinex - files on the internet ( gurtner , 1993 ) .",
    "series of the values of elevations @xmath18 and azimuths @xmath19 of the los to the satellite were used to determine the coordinates of subionospheric points , and to convert the `` oblique '' tec @xmath20 to the corresponding value of the `` vertical '' tec by employing the technique reported by klobuchar ( 1986 )    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the earth s radius , and @xmath23=300 km is the height of the @xmath24-layer maximum .",
    "all results in this study were obtained for elevations @xmath18 larger than 30@xmath25 .",
    "the technology of global detection of tec disturbances that was developed at the istp sb ras makes it possible to select - in the automatic mode from an extensive amount of experimental material - tec disturbances which can be classed as tecs .",
    "tecs were selected by two criteria .",
    "tec variations were selected first , the standard deviation ( rms ) of which exceeded the prescribed level @xmath26 .",
    "the statistic of tecs discussed in this paper was obtained for @xmath26 = 0.1 @xmath15 .",
    "then , for each filtered series we verified the fulfilment of the `` singleness '' condition of the tec overshoot",

    "it is evident from fig . @xmath33 that unusual ( for background disturbances ) tec variations in the form of a single impulse of a duration on the order of @xmath38=10 min",
    "are clearly identified at the background of slow tec variations .",

    "the value of @xmath38 is determined from the level of 0.5 @xmath40 .",
    "the amplitude of this pulse @xmath40 far exceeds the specified threshold @xmath26 and at least an order of magnitude higher than the background tec fluctuation intensity for this range of periods ( afraimovich et al . , 2001b ) .",
    "the relative amplitude of such a response @xmath41 has a significant value , 2@xmath0 .",

    "it should be noted that the above examples both refer to the same time interval and to the stations spaced by a distance over 1300 km .",
    "this indicates a local character of the phenomenon and is in agreement with the overall statistic characterizing its spatial correlation ( see section 3 ) .    for each of the events satisfying the above tecs selection criteria ,",

    "we determine the velocity and direction of motion of the phase interference pattern ( phase front ) in terms of some model of this pattern , an adequate choice of which is of critical importance . in the simplest form ,",
    "space - time variations in phase of the transionospheric radio signal that are proportional to tec variations @xmath69 in the ionosphere , at each given time @xmath70 can be represented in terms of the phase interference pattern that moves without a change in its shape ( the non dispersive disturbances ) :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the displacement velocities of intersection of the phase front of the axes x ( directed to the east ) and y ( directed to the north ) , respectively .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that in real situations this ideal model ( 3 ) is not realized in a pure form . this is because that the tids propagate in the atmosphere in the form of a dispersing wave packet with a finite value of the width of the angular spectrum .",
    "but in the first approximation on short time interval of averaging compared to time period of filtered variations of tec , the phase interference pattern moves without a substantial change in its shape .",
    "a statistical , angle - of - arrival and doppler method ( sadm ) was proposed by afraimovich ( 1997 ) for determining the characteristics of the dynamics of the phase interference pattern in the horizontal plane by measuring variations of phase derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and to the time @xmath76 .",
    "this permits the determination of the unambiguous orientation of @xmath77 of the wave - vector @xmath78 in the range 0360@xmath79 and the horizontal velocity @xmath80 at each specific instant of time .",

    "the method sadm - gps makes it possible to determine the horizontal velocity @xmath80 and the azimuth @xmath77 of tid displacement at each specific instant of time ( the wave - vector orientation @xmath78 ) in a fixed coordinate system ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the @xmath81 and @xmath82 projections of the velocity @xmath86 of the subionospheric point ( for taking into account the motion of the gps satellite ) .",
    "let us take a brief look at the sequence of data handling procedures . out of a large number of gps stations ,",
    "three points ( a , b , c ) are chosen in such a way that the distances between them do not exceed about one - half the expected wavelength @xmath87 of the disturbance .",
    "the point b is taken to be the center of a topocentric frame of reference .",
    "such a configuration of the gps receivers represents a gps - array ( or a gps - interferometer ) with a minimum of the necessary number of elements . in regions with a dense network of gps - points ,",
    "we can obtain a broad range of gps - arrays of a different configuration , which furnishing a means of testing the data obtained for reliability ; in this paper we have taken advantage of this possibility ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the input data include series of the vertical tec @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , as well as corresponding series of values of the elevation @xmath18 and the azimuth @xmath19 of the los .",
    "series of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are used to determine the location of the subionospheric point , as well as to calculate the elevation @xmath91 of the wave vector @xmath78 of the disturbance from the known azimuth @xmath92 ( see formula ( 5 ) ) .",
    "since the distance between gps - array elements ( from several tens to a few hundred of kilometers ) is much smaller than that to the gps satellite ( over 20000  km ) , the array geometry at the height near the main maximum of the @xmath93-layer is identical to that on the ground .",
    "linear transformations of the differences of the values of the filtered tec @xmath94 and @xmath95 at the receiving points a , b and c are used to calculate the components of the tec gradient @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( afraimovich et al .",

    "next , the series @xmath80 and @xmath77 are put to a statistical treatment .",
    "this involves constructing distributions of the horizontal velocity @xmath100 and direction @xmath101 which are analyzed to test the hypothesis of the existence of the preferred propagation direction .",
    "if such a direction does exist , then the corresponding distributions are used to calculate the mean value of the horizontal velocity @xmath102 , as well as the mean value of the azimuth @xmath103 of tid propagation .",
    "the correspondence of space - time tec characteristics , obtained through transionospheric soundings , with local characteristics of disturbances in the ionosphere was considered in detail in a wide variety of publications ( afraimovich et al . , 1992 ; mercier and jacobson , 1997 ) and is not analyzed at length in this study .",
    "the most important conclusion of the cited references is the fact that , as for the extensively exploited model of a ` plane phase screen ' , disturbances @xmath104 of tec faithfully copy the horizontal part of the corresponding disturbance @xmath105 of local concentration , independently of the angular position of the source , and can be used in experiments on measuring the wave velocity of tec .",
    "however , the tec response amplitude experiences a strong ` aspect ' dependence caused by the integral character of a transionospheric sounding . as a first approximation ,",

    "thus the shape of the observed irregularities ( `` traces '' a , b , c , and d ) show up as ellipsoids traveling northward with a velocity of about 200 m / s .",
    "the iid anisotropy was analyzed by determining the `` contrast '' @xmath121 ( mercier , 1986 ) .",
    "we calculated the ratio @xmath122 :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the standard deviations of the corresponding series of the tecs coordinates @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "these series were obtained by transforming the initial series @xmath126 and @xmath127 by rotating the original coordinate system ( n , e ) by an angle @xmath128 :    @xmath129    mercier ( 1986 ) showed that it is possible to find such a value of the rotation angle @xmath130 , at which the ratio @xmath122 will be a maximum and equal to the value of contrast @xmath121 .",
    "this parameter characterizes the degree of anisotropy of the phase interference pattern .",
    "the angle @xmath130 in this case indicates the direction of elongation , and the angle @xmath131 indicates the direction of the wave vector @xmath78 coincident ( module 180@xmath79 ) with the propagation direction of the phase front .",
    "( @xmath132 ) plots the dependencies of the standard deviation @xmath133 of the values of the coordinates of subionospheric points in a topocentric coordinate system , and of the corresponding to @xmath39 , on the rotation angle @xmath113=@xmath130+@xmath134/2 ( @xmath128 stands for the rotation angle of the original coordinate system ) for the `` traces '' a , b , c , and d ( figs . 5 and 6 ) ; fig . 9 ( @xmath135 ) plots",
    "the dependencies of the value of the ratio @xmath122 on @xmath113=@xmath130+@xmath134/2 .",
    "the values of the contrast @xmath121 are shown by the horizontal dashed line .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the value of @xmath121 fluctuates from 6 to 10 , and the greatest contrast for the traces under consideration corresponds to the `` trace '' c and , hence , this trace has the greatest anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the direction of elongation of the major axis of the iid ellipse @xmath130 = -85@xmath25 . for the other `` traces '' the values of the parameter @xmath130",
    "lie in the range from -80@xmath25 to -85@xmath25 .",
    "the panels show the mean values of the angles @xmath113 obtained by the method reported in mercier ( 1986 ) , and the mean values of @xmath92 inferred by the sadm - gps method ( afraimovich , 1997 ; afraimovich et al . , 1998 ; 1999 ; 2000c ) for each of the `` traces '' .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the values of the angle @xmath92 , calculated by the two methods , agree to within 5 - 10@xmath25 .",
    "we now estimate the horizontal sizes of the iid . with the mean duration of 10 min and the travel velocity of 180 m / s ,",
    "we obtain the transverse size of the irregularity equal to 108 km . with the value of the contrast @xmath121=9 , the longitudinal size equal to 864 km .",
    "let us now obtain the mean estimate of the relative amplitude of a local electron density disturbance typified by the iid of october 5 , 2001 .    a mean tecs absolute amplitude over california equal 0.1 @xmath15 ( see fig.1*c , f * ) .",
    "as the background value of @xmath42 , we used the absolute `` vertical '' tec value of @xmath17 obtained from ionex - maps of the tec ( see fig.10*c * ) .",
    "these maps with two - hour temporal resolution were constructed using the well - known methods and are placed on the internet site ftp://cddisa.gsfc.naa.gov/.    fig.10*c * shows the variations of the absolute `` vertical '' tec value @xmath17 for the site with the coordinates 240@xmath79e ; 35@xmath79n . at the lower time scale in fig.10",
    ", the local time lt is represented for the longitude of 240@xmath25e .",
    "for comparison fig.10*d * present the distribution @xmath68 of the number of tecs that were detected that day at all gps stations used in the analysis , with the rms above @xmath26=0.1 @xmath15 ( this is copy of fig.5*f * ) .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "10*c * and *",
    "d * reveals that the greatest tecs occurrence probability corresponds to the night - time hours for which the `` vertical '' tec value @xmath17 does not exceed 10 @xmath15 .",
    "hence the relative amplitude of tecs @xmath136 makes up 1@xmath0 , that is quite significant for this disturbance period ( @xmath38 = 10 min ) and exceeds one order of magnitude the amplitude of typical background tec fluctuations ( afraimovich et al .",
    ", 2001a ) .",
    "it is further assumed that the characteristic vertical size of the iid is of the same order as the transverse horizontal size ( of about 100 km - see section 4.3 ) .",
    "the vertical extent of the part of the ionosphere that makes the main contribution to the tec modulation is no less than 500 - 1000 km .",
    "hence it follows that the relative amplitude @xmath110 of the local electron density disturbance for iid reaches a considerably large value , 510@xmath0 .",
    "what is the nature of the ionospheric irregularities that are responsible for the occurrence of tecs , and do they differ from the known published ionospheric disturbances ?",
    "we shall try to unravel this situation using the sample statistic obtained in section 3 and the october 5 , 2001 event as an example , because for this event it was possible not only to record a large number of tecs but also to obtain estimates of the size , anisotropy and velocity of isolated ionospheric irregularities that are responsible for the occurrence of tecs ( section 4 ) .",
    "it is significant that , according to internet data for the concerned region of the usa and for the time interval of october 5 , 2001 of our interest , there were not observable meteorological phenomena ( site http://www.solar.ifa.hawaii.edu/tropical/ ) , powerful explosions and rocket launchings able to cause tec variations of the tecs type .",
    "the @xmath137 rocket was launched from the `` vandenberg '' spaceport ( @xmath138e ; @xmath139n ) on october 5 at 21:21 ut ( the launching time is shown by the filled triangle in fig.5*f * ) .",
    "however , most tecs on that day were observed before the launching time .",
    "as far as seismic activity is concerned , we analyzed the data covering not only the time interval of our interest but also for the period from october 4 to 20 , 2001 ( http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/fm/previous/0107.html ) .",
    "no earthquakes with the magnitude larger than 3.5 were recorded in the region of our interest for the above time interval .    for the october 5 , 2001 , time interval of our interest , tec fluctuations similar to tecs detected over california were absent elsewhere on the globe .",
    "no solar flare - induced background fluctuations of the tec disturbance were also revealed .",
    "a similar , quiet , behavior over this time interval was also characteristic for the energetic particle flux .",
    "we do not present here the relevant data for reasons of space .",
    "they may be found on the site http://www.sel.noaa.gov/ftpmenu/lists.html .    the geomagnetic situation on october 5 , 2001 can be characterized as a weakly disturbed one , which must lead to some increase of the level of tec background fluctuations ; however , this can not cause any large - scale changes in electron density which are characteristic for the geomagnetically disturbed ionosphere . in the analysis of the geomagnetic situation we used the data from magnetic observatory victoria ( 48.52@xmath25n ; 236.58@xmath25e ) which , for the time interval 15:00 - 18:00 ut of our interest , recorded a geomagnetic disturbance implying a decrease of the horizontal component of the magnetic field by 100 nt ( fig . 5*b * ) .",
    "this disturbance was also accompanied by an increase of the @xmath140-component fluctuation amplitude in the range of 2 - 20-min periods ( fig.5*c * ) .",
    "the variation range of the geomagnetic @xmath56-index for the selected time interval was also relatively small ( no more than 20 nt ) ; however , the period from 08:00 to 15:00 ut showed a clearly pronounced increase in variations of the @xmath56-index that coincided with the period when the @xmath140-component of the magnetic field was increasing ( fig .",
    "5*a * ) .",
    "hence , the data from magnetic - variation stations do not suggest the conclusion that the observed tecss are associated with magnetic field variations .",
    "first of all , it is important to remark that tecs variations are close in amplitude , form and duration to the tec response to shock - acoustic waves ( saw ) generated during rocket launchings ( calais and minster , 1996 ; calais et al .",
    ", 1998b ; li et al . , 1994 ; afraimovich et al . ,",
    "2000a ; 2001b ) , earthquakes ( calais and minster , 1995 ; afraimovich et al . , 2001c ) , and explosions ( fitzgerald , 1997 ; calais et al .",
    ", 1998a ) . in this connection",
    ", tecs can mask tec responses to technogenic effects and lead to spurious signals recorded in detection systems for such effects , based on analyzing signals from the global gps network .",
    "afraimovich et al .",
    "( 2000a ; 2001b ; 2001c ) found that spite of a difference of rockets and earthquakes characteristics , the ionospheric tec response for all such events had the character of an @xmath48wave corresponding to the form of a shock wave .",
    "the saw period @xmath38 is 270360  s , and the amplitude exceeds the standard deviation of total electron content background fluctuations in this range of periods under quiet and moderate geomagnetic conditions by factors of 2 to 5 as a minimum . the angle of elevation @xmath91 of the saw wave vector varies from 30@xmath79 to 60@xmath79 , and the saw phase velocity @xmath108 ( 9001200  m / s ) approaches the sound velocity at heights of the ionospheric @xmath141-region maximum .",
    "a spatial and temporal processing of data from gps arrays can be used in selecting these phenomena in order to estimate the propagation velocity of tec disturbances . in particular , the velocity of iids ( 150200 m / s ) is far less than the saw velocity ( 9001200  m / s ) and is most likely to correspond to the propagation velocity of medium - scale background agw ( kalikhman , 1980 ; afraimovich et al . , 1998 ; 1999 ; mercier , 1986 ; mercier and jacobson , 1997 ; hocke and schlegel , 1996 ; oliver et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the saw and iid responses can be distinguished using this attribute , as well as from the difference of angular characteristics of the disturbance wave vector ( see section 4 ) .      as has been pointed out in the introduction , a large number of publications ( e.g. , karasawa , 1985 ; titheridge , 1971 ; etc . ) , were devoted to the study the `` spikes - type '' ( s- ) scintillations .",
    "bowman ( 1989 ) observed quasi - periodic ( qp ) oscillations of the signal from an orbiting satellite at 150 mhz frequency .",
    "the anticipated cause of the occurrence of such qp oscillations is fresnel diffraction from ionospheric irregularities .",
    "evidently , irregularities giving rise to qp oscillations reside in the @xmath142 level containing a host of small regions ( less than 200 m in size ) with high electron density separated from one another by a distance of several tens of kilometers .",
    "the occurrence of qp oscillations is peaked in the night - time hours .",
    "the calculated velocities of irregularities and @xmath142 structures range from 50 to 100 m / s .",
    "the cited authors point out that transionospheric signal variations of this kind are observed mostly at night and are most likely caused by the irregularities located in the @xmath142-layer .",
    "this brings up the question of whether the tecs recorded by us are able to be caused by such ionospheric irregularities . at this point",
    "it should be noted that tecs are also observed mostly at night , and their velocities ( on the order of 100 km / s ) are close to those obtained by karasawa ( 1985 ) , titheridge ( 1971 ) , and bowman ( 1989 ) .    in order to verify the validity of this tecs model for the october 5 , 2001 event we availed ourselves of the data ( placed on the site http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/ ) from the ionospheric station point arguello located in the center of the region of our interest .",
    "fig.10*a * present the values of the critical frequencies @xmath143  heavy dots ; @xmath144  crosses ; @xmath145 shaded triangles , measured on october , 5 , 2001 at ionospheric station point arguello ( 239.4@xmath146 ; 34.6@xmath147 ) ; fig.10*b *  variations of virtual height @xmath148  shaded triangles , @xmath149  crosses .",
    "an analysis of the dependence of critical frequencies and effective heights of reflections from the @xmath141- and @xmath142-regions showed that during 08 - 14 ut when the largest number of tecs was recorded , reflections from the @xmath142-layer were absent altogether ( cf . panels * a , b , d * ) .",
    "thus we did not obtain any direct confirmation of the fact that tecs were caused by intense ionospheric irregularities located in the @xmath142-layer .",
    "the question of the origin of the iid that are responsible for tecs remains open .",
    "it should be noted that direct comparison of our results with the data obtained by karasawa ( 1985 ) , titheridge ( 1971 ) , and bowman ( 1989 ) , is made difficult by the fact that the overwhelming amount of earlier data was obtained for amplitude , rather than phase , scintillations . on the other hand ,",
    "extracting data on amplitude variations of gps signals from internet rinex - files is highly difficult ( gurtner , 1993 ) .    to understand the nature of tecs requires invoking data from different , independent diagnostic tools , including incoherent scatter radars , ionosondes , magnetometers , etc .",
    "main results of this study may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "tecs constitute a rare event that occurs mainly in the night - time in the spring and autumn periods , in a weakly disturbed or quiet geomagnetic situation .",
    "2 .   in the time region , tecs represent single negative aperiodic abrupt changes of tec with a duration of about 10 - 20 min ; the mean value of the tecs amplitude exceeds the mean value of the tec variation amplitude by a factor of 4 - 5 as a minimum and is 0.2 @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   tecs represent a local phenomenon with a typical radius of spatial correlation not larger than 500 km .",
    "the tecs we recorded on october 5 , 2001 , were caused by isolated ionospheric irregularities of the ellipsoid shape , with the direction of elongation of the major axis of the ellipse on the order of -85@xmath25 .",
    "iids travel in a direction perpendicular to their elongation ( northward in the case under consideration ) with the mean velocity @xmath150=160 m / s , which corresponds to the velocity of medium - scale agw ( of about 100 - 200 m / s ) .",
    "the size of the observed irregularities is 100 km by 800 km , respectively .",
