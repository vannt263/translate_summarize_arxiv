    "protoplanetary disks are composed of gas and dust . at initial stages of their evolution ,",
    "the gas of protoplanetary disks is as massive as @xmath4 ( greaves 2004 ) , and small dust particles are mixed with the gas , making the disks optically thick at optical wavelengths . as the dust particles grow , the number of small particles reduces , and at a certain stage , the disks become optically thin ( tanaka et al .",
    "2005 ; dullemond & dominik 2005 ) .",
    "the amount of gas also decreases , as the gas dissipates ( e.g. , hartmann et al . 1998 ; clarke et al . 2001 ; takeuchi et al . 2005 ; alexander et al .",

    "the disks become gas - free dust disks , which are observed as vega - type disks . during the transition from protoplanetary disks to vega - type disks",
    ", there may be a stage where the disks are optically thin , but their gas component still remains .",
    "an example is hd 141569a , which is a 5 myr herbig be star ( weinberger et al .",
    "2000 ) and has an optically thin dust disk ( augereau et al .",

    ".    dynamics of dust particles in optically thin gas disks is of interest in order to investigate the structure of transitional disks .",
    "krauss & wurm ( 2005 ) considered the motion of dust particles in a gas disk that is optically thin at optical wavelengths .",
    "a dust particle receives stellar radiation directly , and the radiation pressure pushes the particle outward .",
    "in addition to radiation pressure , interaction between the particle and the surrounding gas molecules induces photophoresis , which also pushes the particle outward ( see also wurm & krauss 2006 ; krauss et al .",
    "2007 ) . when these outward accelerations act with the gas drag on the particle , the particle drifts outward ( takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ) . in the outer part of the disk ( @xmath6 au ) , where the mean free path of the gas molecules is larger than the particle size ( of @xmath1 m ) , the photophoretic force is proportional to the gas density .",
    "when a particle moves outward to the point where the gas density is no longer high enough to induce a strong photophoretic force , the particle s outward motion stops .",
    "consequently , the dust particles pile - up at a certain distance from the star that is determined by the density profile of the gas disk . in a gas disk with mass @xmath7 , particles of @xmath8 to 10 cm pile - up at several tens of au .",
    "this spontaneous ring formation is a characteristic feature that is caused by photophoresis in a gaseous dust disk .",
    "krauss et al . (",
    "2007 ) have demonstrated that photophoretic dust motion may be the key process for the transition from optically thick protoplanetary disks to optically thin circumstellar disks with ring - like dust distributions via the stage of transitional disks with an inner hole and a more or less sharp transition to the outer disk that is continuously pushed outward .",
    "this outward dust migration can also explain the presence of material formed close to the sun like chondrules and cais in asteroids of the main asteroid belt ( wurm & krauss 2006 ) or high temperature crystalline silicates in comets from the kuiper belt ( petit et al .",

    ", we seek to investigate other characteristic structures formed by photophoresis , especially in the inner part of the disk , but at a stage when most of the dust has already been built into larger bodies .",
    "krauss & wurm ( 2005 ) focus on the dust dynamics in the outer part of the disk ( @xmath6  au ) and use a formula for the photophoretic force that is relevant for low gas densities . in order to investigate the structure of the whole disk , we use a photophoresis formula that can be applied to the whole range of gas densities .",
    "details of the formula for the photophoretic force adopted here are described in ",
    "[ sec : drift ] . using this formula",
    ", we find that photophoresis does not induce dust pile - up at the innermost region of the disk ( @xmath9 au ) , leading to the formation of an inner hole ( see  [ sec : accrad ] ) . at the inner part of the gas disk",
    ", the gas density may be too high that the gas disk itself is no longer optically thin to the stellar radiation , and thus any radiation effects on the dust such as radiation pressure and photophoresis do not work at all . in order to investigate whether photophoresis still works at the inner disk , in ",
    "[ sec : opacity ] , we calculate the optical depth of the disk due to rayleigh scattering of the hydrogen molecules . in  [ sec : discussion1 ] , the thermal relaxation time of dust particles is estimated and is compared to the rotation periods induced by gas turbulence and by photophoresis . in  [ sec : discussion2 ] , we discuss what are the characteristic features that photophoresis forms in dust disks , and what are the observable differences from the gas - free dust disk structures . in appendix",
    "a , a simple calculation deriving the photophoretic force is described .",
    "we consider the motion of a dust particle that resides in a gas disk around a star .",
    "the gas disk is assumed to be optically thin in the radial direction .",
    "this means that the dust particle directly receives the radiation of the central star .",
    "the stellar radiation that is absorbed or scattered by the particle pushes it outward .",
    "this outward force , which is called radiation pressure ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) , is given by @xmath10 where we assume that the particle is spherical and its radius is @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the efficiency factor of the radiation pressure and assumed to be unity in this paper , and @xmath13 is the speed of light .",
    "we assume that the particle is on the midplane of the gas disk and the distance from the central star is @xmath14 .",
    "the flux of the stellar radiation at the particle position is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the luminosity of the central star .",
    "poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag can be neglected comparing to gas drag . even in a gas disk",
    "whose mass is as small as several earth mass , gas drag is much stronger than pr drag as discussed below in  [ sec : timesc ] ( see also takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ) .",
    "if the particle s hemisphere facing the central star becomes hotter than the opposite hemisphere , the particle receives the photophoretic force in addition to the radiation pressure .",
    "because , in general , the particle rotates with a certain speed , a considerable temperature gradient appears only if the thermal relaxation time of the particle is much smaller than the rotation period ( see discussion in  [ sec : discussion1 ] below ) , or if the rotation axis is aligned in the direction of the light source ( krauss et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this paper , we assume that the effect of the particle rotation can be neglected . in this case , the photophoretic force is directed in the radial direction and its value can be analytically calculated . in appendix",
    "a , we describe estimate of the photophoretic force derived by a simple model of cylindrical dust particles , but we use the rigorous formulae that have been derived in the literature in the following discussion .",
    "we consider a spherical dust particle of radius @xmath11 .",

    "the temperature gradient inside the particle is assumed to be small , and then the photophoretic force is calculated by solving linearized perturbation equation of the temperature . in appendix",
    "a , we discuss the cases where the above assumptions are not valid .    if the particle radius , @xmath11 , is much smaller than the mean free path of the surrounding gas molecules , @xmath20 , i.e. , the knudsen number @xmath21 , then the photophoretic force is calculated with the free molecular approximation ( hidy & brock 1967 ; mackowski 1989 ; beresnev et al . 1993 ) and is given by @xmath22 } \\",
    ",   \\label{eq : fph_f}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the gas pressure , @xmath24 is the thermal conductivity inside the particle , @xmath25 is the particle s emissivity of thermal radiation and assumed to be unity , @xmath26 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath27 is the mean thermal velocity of the gas molecules .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath28 represents how effectively the incident starlight induces a temperature gradient inside the particle .",
    "if the incident light is perfectly absorbed at the particle surface , the asymmetry parameter @xmath28 has the maximum value @xmath29 , and it becomes smaller as the temperature gradient becomes smaller .",
    "the gas molecules that hit the particle are assumed to leave the particle with the maxwell velocity distribution of the local surface temperature of the particle ( i.e. , the accommodation factor @xmath30 ) . in many cases ,",
    "the denominator of equation ( [ eq : fph_f ] ) is dominated by the first or second terms , i.e. , the temperature gradient in the particle is determined by the internal thermal conduction or by the radiative cooling , rather than by the thermal conduction to the gas . in this case , the photophoretic force is approximated by @xmath31 where we used @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the number density of the gas molecules , @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath36 is the collisional cross section of the gas molecules . in the free molecular regime ,",
    "the photophoretic force is inversely proportional to the gas mean free path and proportional then to the gas density .",
    "if the particle size , @xmath11 , is much larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules , @xmath20 , i.e. , the knudsen number @xmath37 , then the photophoretic force is calculated with the slip - flow approximation ( mackowski 1989 ) .",
    "mackowski ( 1989 ) calculated the photophoretic force assuming that the thermal radiation from the particle surface can be neglected .",
    "when the thermal radiation is taken into account , his formula is modified to ( see appendix b for the derivation ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the coefficients for the jump conditions at the surface and are of order of unity .",
    "we adopt the values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( mackowski 1989 ) .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the gas is @xmath46 where we set the prandtl number to be @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath48 is approximated by unity , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , the photophoretic force is proportional to the gas mean free path .    to connect the above two regimes",
    ", we introduce the following formula @xmath52 in the limit of @xmath49 , @xmath53 approaches @xmath54 , and in the other limit ( @xmath55 ) , it approaches @xmath56 .",
    "if the particle rotation can not be neglected , there are two effects we must consider .",
    "first , the temperature gradient in the particle becomes smaller as the particle rotates faster .",
    "this effectively reduces the asymmetry factor @xmath28 . in the limit of rapid rotation ,",
    "the asymmetry factor @xmath28 approaches zero .",
    "second , the temperature gradient generally does not coincide with the direction of the light source , i.e. , the radial direction .",
    "the photophoretic force has a component in the azimuthal direction , and can give or take away angular momentum of the particle , depending on the orientation of the rotation .",
    "the particle drifts outward or inward , and the direction of the drift reverses when the orientation of the rotation changes .",
    "this is similar to the yarkovsky effect acting on asteroids ( bottke et al .",
    "2002 ) , although , in the case of photophoresis , the agents of momentum transfer are the gas molecules and not emitted photons .",
    "the particle radial drift due to this effect is stochastic , if the variation in the rotational orientation occurs frequently before the particle travels a large distance in the radial direction . though the study of photophoretic yarkovsky effect is important",
    ", we leave this for future investigations , and in this paper we assume that the photophoretic force is always directed to the radial direction .    for further discussion , it is convenient to normalize the radiative forces given above by the gravitational force @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gravitational constant , @xmath59 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath60 is the mass of the particle .",
    "we introduce a normalization factor @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the free molecular regime ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath64 at large distances from the star , the dust temperature is so low that @xmath65 , and that @xmath66 is independent of the particle radius @xmath11 .",
    "next we consider the forces acting on the gas .",
    "the gravity acting on a unit volume of the gas is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass density of the gas .",
    "the pressure gradient force on a unit volume is @xmath69 we introduce a normalization factor @xmath70 in a similar way to the dust particle , @xmath71      for simplicity , we assume that the gas disk has a power - law profile of the temperature , @xmath18 , in the radial direction @xmath14 , and is isothermal in the vertical direction @xmath72 , i.e. , it is written as @xmath73 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes quantities at 1 au , and the non - dimensional quantity @xmath74 is the radius in au .",
    "the gas density , @xmath68 , is also assumed to have a power - law profile in @xmath14 and be in a hydrostatic equilibrium in @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath75 where the disk scale height is @xmath76 .",
    "the isothermal sound speed of the disk is @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is written by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the keplerian angular frequency at the disk midplane . the gas surface density is @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "we adopt the following fiducial parameters for the central star and the gas temperature profile : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 au , and @xmath87 .",
    "the mean mass of the gas molecules is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mass of a hydrogen atom ( nakagawa et al .",
    "the collisional cross section of the gas molecules is @xmath90 ( p. 228 in chapman & cowling 1970 ) .",
    "we consider disks in which most of small dust grains have been removed and consequently the disks have become optically thin even in the radial direction .",
    "the dust opacity in optical wavelength arises mainly from particles smaller than @xmath91 ( see fig . 4 of miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) . in order for the disk to be optically thin",
    ", the column density of small grains ( @xmath92 ) from the star must be smaller than @xmath93 .",
    "removal of dust grains probably occurs through coagulation of the grains into planetesimals ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; tanaka et al . 2005 ; dullemond & dominik 2005 ; nomura & nakagawa 2006 ) . in such disks ,",
    "the amount of the gas component has likely also reduced .",
    "actually most vega - type stars do not have detectable gas components ( liseau & artymowicz 1998 ; greaves et al 2000 ; coulson et al .",
    "2004 ; chen & kamp 2004 ) , and only a few objects have gas as massive as several tens earth masses . for example , hd 141569a has    a gas mass of @xmath94 ( zuckerman et al .",
    "1995 ; ardila et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , in model a , we consider a disk in which the amount of the gas inside 100 au is @xmath95 . ( the model disk extends over 100 au .",
    "we specify the disk mass as the mass inside 100 au . )",
    "we take a surface density profile proposed by hayashi et al . ( 1985 ) in which the power - law index is @xmath96 .",
    "the gas surface density is @xmath97 .",
    "in addition to model a , we also consider a more massive disk to investigate a case in which the disk opacity due to the dust has been significantly reduced before considerable gas dissipation occurs . in model b ,",
    "the gas amount inside 100 au is @xmath98 .",
    "further , we assume the density profile is more gradual than model a and @xmath99 .",
    "this gentle slope of the density profile assures that the gas density in the innermost part of the disk ( say @xmath2 au ) does not become so high that the rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen makes the gas disk itself become optically thick to the starlight ( see  [ sec : opacity_ray ] below ) .",
    "the gas surface density in model b is @xmath100 .    for dust particles , we use the following fiducial parameters : the thermal conductivity @xmath101 , the particle bulk density @xmath102 , and the asymmetry factor @xmath103 , the emissivity @xmath104 , and perfect accommodation of gas molecules @xmath105 .",
    "the adopted value of the thermal conductivity is typical for porous aggregates ( presley & christensen 1997 ) .",
    "if the dust particles are more compact , the thermal conductivity can be much higher .      both the radiation pressure and the photophoretic force direct outward .",
    "if the sum of these forces is stronger than the gravity of the central star , i.e. , @xmath106 , then the particle is not bound to the central star and is ejected from the system . if @xmath107 , the particle is bound to the central star , but it feels a net force weaker than the gravity of the central star , and its orbital motion is slower than keplerian . assuming the particle s orbit is circular and neglecting any contribution of the gas drag force , the azimuthal velocity of the particle is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "the azimuthal velocity of the gas is also sub - keplerian because the pressure gradient force usually directs outward , and is given by @xmath110    now we consider the effect of the gas drag force acting on a particle that is bound to the central star ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) . if the particle orbits faster than the surrounding gas ( @xmath111 ) , then the gas drag transfers the angular momentum of the particle to the surrounding gas .",
    "consequently , the particle loses angular momentum and drifts radially to the central star . from equations (",
    "[ eq : vth_d ] ) and ( [ eq : vth_g ] ) , it is seen that this inward drift occurs if @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle orbits slower than the surrounding gas ( @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 ) , then the particle gets angular momentum from the surrounding gas , and drifts radially away from the central star . when the particle happens to be on the orbit in which its azimuthal velocity equals the gas azimuthal velocity , there is no angular momentum transfer by gas drag , and the particle stays on the equilibrium orbit .",
    "more detailed discussions including the derivation of the drift velocity were written in takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) . from their equation ( 26 ) for the drift velocity , neglecting the term of the poynting - robertson drag , @xmath115 , gives @xmath116 where the non - dimensional stopping time is @xmath117 [ the factor @xmath118 difference between eq .",
    "( 10 ) of takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : tstop ] ) comes from the different definition of @xmath119 , see their eq .",
    "( 6 ) ]    we can know the direction of the particle s radial drift by seeing if @xmath120 is larger than @xmath70 or not .",
    "figure [ fig : beta / eta]@xmath11 shows the ratio @xmath121 against the distance from the central star for model a. if a particle has @xmath120 larger than @xmath70 of the surrounding gas , it drifts away from the star , and vice versa .",
    "the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity , @xmath122 , which is inversely proportional to the particle radius @xmath11 , is constant with the distance from the star @xmath14 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : beta_rad ] ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as the gas mean free path @xmath20 is larger than the particle radius @xmath11 ( free molecular regime ) , the photophoretic force is inversely proportional to the knudsen number @xmath123 ( see eq . [ [ eq : fph_f_apx ] ] ) , and hence decreases with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , at large distances from the central star , the radiation pressure dominates the photophoretic force , i.e. , @xmath124 , while at small distances , the photophoretic force dominates and @xmath125 .",
    "the transition occurs at 1 au for @xmath91 particles , 3 au for @xmath126 particles , and 7 au for @xmath127 particles .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig : beta / eta]@xmath11 bend at these distances and the slopes become gentler at larger distances .",
    "the slopes of the curves , @xmath128 , are determined only by @xmath129 at large distances , because @xmath122 is constant with @xmath14 , and have the same value for differently sized particles . inside the transition distances , where the photophoretic force dominates",
    ", @xmath130 increases with decreasing the knudsen number @xmath123 , or decreasing the distance from the central star .",
    "this increase in @xmath120 continues until the mean free path of the gas molecules @xmath20 becomes smaller than the particle radius @xmath11 , i.e. , until @xmath123 becomes less than unity . at the innermost part of the disk",
    "in which @xmath131 ( slip - flow regime photophoresis ) , @xmath120 is proportional to @xmath123 ( see eq . [ [ eq : fph_s ] ] ) and decreases with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "the transition from the free molecular regime photophoresis to the slip - flow regime photophoresis occurs at the distance where @xmath132 , and at this transition distance , @xmath133 has the maximum value . for @xmath134 particles , @xmath133 has a peak at @xmath135 au , and for larger particles the peak position shifts outward .",
    "it is @xmath136 au for @xmath137 cm particles .",
    "it is seen from figure [ fig : beta / eta]@xmath11 that particles smaller than @xmath137 cm have a region where @xmath120 is greater than @xmath70 .",
    "in such a region the particles drift outward .",
    "the outward drift of the particles stops at the locations where @xmath138 . at these locations , the particles that drift inward from the outer region",
    "also stop .",
    "hence , the particles accumulate at the location where @xmath138 and @xmath139 , leading to the formation of a dust ring as proposed by krauss & wurm ( 2005 )",
    ". particle accumulation does not occur at the location where @xmath138 but @xmath140 , because the particles drift away from such locations .",
    "note that , at the locations where particles accumulate , the knudsen number @xmath123 is always larger than unity , and thus the photophoretic force is expressed in its form for the free molecular regime .",
    "the location of particle accumulation is at 5 au for @xmath134 particles , and moves closer to the central star as the particle radius increases .",
    "particles of 10 cm accumulate at @xmath136 au . if the particles are larger than 10 cm , they always drift toward the central star and can not accumulate anywhere . in summary ,",
    "particle accumulation occurs if @xmath141 somewhere in the disk .",
    "the accumulation location is specified by the conditions @xmath138 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .    for 10 cm and 1 m particles , the curves in figure [ fig : beta / eta]@xmath11 again bend at @xmath144 au . inside these distances , the radiation pressure becomes stronger than the photophoretic force because the knudsen number is too low .",
    "thus , @xmath120 keeps constant with @xmath14 in this region , while @xmath70 increases , resulting in a decrease in @xmath133 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for model b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta / eta]@xmath145 ) . in this model ,",
    "particles of all sizes are driven farther outward compared to model a. this is because the gas density is higher in the model b disk , resulting in an increase in @xmath66 . in model b",
    ", it is also    apparent that @xmath134 @xmath146 1 cm particles accumulate in a narrow region of @xmath147 au .",
    "this pile - up of particles in a narrow ring has been pointed out by krauss & wurm ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is the consequence of @xmath66 being independent of the particle radius at large distances ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : beta_ph_f ] ] ) .",
    "note that accumulation of outward migrating particles to the ring radius do not increase the optical depth to the star .",
    "formation of the dust ring through clearing the inner dust disk does not suppress further evolution by photophoresis .",
    "however , after clearing the inner dust , the optical depth of the ring increases as particles from the outer disk accumulate . when the dust ring becomes optically thick , photophoresis is weakened and then the ring shrinks . in this paper , we consider the stage where the dust ring is optically thin .",
    "as discussed in the above section , particles accumulate at the equilibrium locations where @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in figure",

    "we also calculate the case in which photophoresis does not work at all ( @xmath155 ) .      at the accumulation locations ,",
    "photophoresis is under the free molecular regime ( @xmath156 ) , and as seen from equation ( [ eq : beta_ph_f ] ) , @xmath66 converges to a certain value in the limit of small @xmath11 . on the other hand",

    "particles that are subject to photophoresis have the tendency to accumulate in a narrow ring region , provided that all particles have the same physical properties , i.e. , they have the same values of @xmath159 , @xmath24 , and @xmath28 .",
    "for example , in the fiducial model ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : req]@xmath11 ) , particles of @xmath160 mm accumulate in a region of @xmath161 au , and @xmath162 cm particles of the higher conductivity @xmath163 accumulate at @xmath164 au .",
    "hence , a significant influence of photophoresis is to condense the particles of a certain size interval . for small particles ,",
    "this size interval is limited by the increasing influence of radiation pressure . for large particles ,",
    "the limit is determined by the increasing importance of thermal emission and conduction to the gas for the thermal relaxation and the approach to @xmath165 .",

    "the properties of particles are probably not homogeneous , but the dust disks are composed of a wide variety of particles .",
    "even particles of the same size therefore spread over a certain range of distances , and the dust ring formed by photophoresis has some extent in the radial direction .",
    "we still expect , however , particle concentration in the disk happens to some degree .",
    "even if the parameter range of the particle properties is as wide as that considered in figure [ fig : req]@xmath11 , we clearly see two populations of dust particles",
    ". all the particles at distances larger than 10 au are smaller than 1 mm and do not show any sign of concentration .",
    "the dust population inside 10 au is composed of particles larger than @xmath8 , and is confined in a region between @xmath169 au .",
    "we call this region as an inner disk .",
    "these two populations are divided by the condition which of the radiation pressure or the photophoretic force is larger than the other .",
    "the population of small particles is subject to radiation pressure , and the other is subject to photophoresis .",
    "hence , the effect of photophoresis is to discriminate large particles from small particles and to confine them to the inner region of the disk .",
    "another significant feature of figure [ fig : req]@xmath11 is that in the region below the dotted line , which represents the area where @xmath170 , there is no equilibrium location where particle accumulation through photophoresis occurs . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : radialmot ] , particle accumulation by photophoresis always occurs at locations where @xmath143 .",
    "if photophoresis does not work ( @xmath28=0 ) , it is seen in figure [ fig : req]@xmath11 that particles can accumulate even in the region where @xmath131 .",
    "this feature will be a possible observational evidence for showing that photophoresis actually occurs in gas disks , though it requires observations of the innermost part of the disk ( @xmath171 au ) with a very high spatial resolution .",
    "if photophoresis actually works , we would find that an inner hole opens in the dust disk , and that its radius is determined by the condition @xmath165 .",
    "if photophoresis does not work , on the other hand , the dust particles would exist even in a region where @xmath170 .",
    "an actual dust disk is a mixture of particles of various physical properties .",
    "if the dust particles have the range of properties that are considered in figure [ fig : req ] , the inner radius ( that is determined by the particles of @xmath172 or @xmath173 ) is @xmath2 au .",
    "this inner radius may be as small as @xmath174 au , if there are considerable numbers of particles on that photophoresis works very weakly ( i.e. , particles of very small @xmath28 , but in that case the inner disk clearing is probably suppressed as shown by the @xmath155 line . )    we stress that the knudsen number @xmath123 is only a function of the dust particle size @xmath11 and the mean free path of the gas molecules @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the inner radii of dust disks do not directly reflect the dust particles physical properties such as the thermal conductivity @xmath24 , the bulk density @xmath159 , and the efficiency of photophoresis @xmath28 .",
    "( the particle size at the inner edge does depend on the particle properties . )",
    "the fact that the inner radius of the dust disk is determined only by the particle size considerably helps us when we observationally test the idea of inner hole opening by photophoresis . on the other hand ,",
    "it is of great importance to have an independent measurement of the local gas density to decide whether the condition @xmath165 is fulfilled , which might still be a challenging task for modern observational techniques .",
    "figure [ fig : req]@xmath145 shows the equilibrium distances with the same parameter combinations as in figure [ fig : req]@xmath11 but for the disk model b. in model b , where the disk mass ( inside 100 au ) is @xmath175 times larger than that of model a , 1 mm to 10 cm particles may extend farther from the central star than in model a due to photophoresis ( up to @xmath176 au ) .",
    "the inner radius of the dust disk locates at @xmath2 au ( for the particles of @xmath172 or @xmath173 ) , and is similar to that in model a. this is just because we take such a density distribution for model b that the distances where @xmath123 equals unity for the particle size @xmath177 do not considerably differ from those in model a. this choice of the density distribution in model b comes from the requirement that the gas disk must be optically thin and we take a marginally optically thin disk ( see  [ sec : opacity_ray ] below ) .",
    "the timescale for the dust particles to migrate to the accumulation locations is @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the equilibrium distance shown in figure [ fig : req ] and @xmath180 is the radial drift velocity . in equation ( [ eq : vrd ] ) , @xmath181 near the equilibrium distance @xmath179 , and thus the drift velocity @xmath180 is estimated as @xmath182 .",

    "in the previous sections , we assumed that the disk is optically thin even in the radial direction and dust particles directly receive the light from the central star .",
