    "the near - uv is a critical wavelength regime for quasar absorption line spectroscopy . whilst blue - sensitive ground - based instruments such as",
    "uves at the vlt have opened the door for such efforts as measuring the molecular content of dlas ( ledoux et al .",
    "2003 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2008 ) and the study of the low redshift forest ( e.g. kim et al . 2002 ) , studying neutral hydrogen at @xmath4 requires a space telescope .",
    "moreover , due to the declining number density of galactic scale absorbers , such as damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) , at low redshifts , blind searches for these galaxies place unrealistic demands on space resources . therefore ,",
    "whilst the number of known dlas at @xmath5 is now in excess of 1000 , thanks to trawling large ground - based optical surveys ( http://www.ucolick.org/@xmath6xavier/sdssdla/index.html ) , the head - count of low redshift dlas is only around 5% of the high @xmath7 tally ( e.g. rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) .",
    "characterising the low - to - intermediate redshift dla population is important not just for the large fraction of cosmic time that it represents , but also because the detection of galactic counterparts for the absorbers is largely only feasible at @xmath8 .    in order to circumvent the high cost of a blind survey for low @xmath7 dlas , the practice in recent years has been to pre - select dla candidates based on the detection of strong metal lines in ground - based spectra ( e.g. rao & turnshek 2000 ) .",
    "although there is no tight correlation between the  and 2  equivalent width ( ew ) , there is a statistical correlation for large samples , e.g. bouch ( 2008 ) and mnard & chelouche ( 2008 ) . in the most recent survey of low @xmath7 dlas selected by metal lines , rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that 36% of absorbers with rest frame ews of 2  @xmath1 2796 and 2  @xmath1 2600 @xmath9 0.5    were dlas . including the additional criterion that the ew of mgi @xmath10  , increases success rate for identifying dlas to 42% .",
    "the remaining absorbers were found to have 18.0 @xmath11 log  @xmath11 20.3 ( table 1 of rao et al .",
    "2006 ) , thus spanning the range from lyman limit systems ( lls ) to sub - dlas .",
    "whereas dlas have neutral hydrogen column densities  @xmath12 , sub - dlas are usually defined ( e.g. peroux et al .",
    "2003a ) to have 19.0 @xmath11 log   @xmath11 20.3 .",
    "the upper bound of this classification corresponds to the transition to classical dlas , whilst the lower limit is driven by the clarity of the  damping wing necessary to produce a reliable fit .",
    "the lls and sub - dlas are usually excluded from the statistical calculation of quantities such as @xmath13 ( the mass density of neutral gas ) .",
    "the contribution of sub - dlas to @xmath13 , and even the validity of including the sub - dlas in the census for neutral gas are still hotly debated topics ( e.g. peroux et al .",
    "2003b ; prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe 2005 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the sub - dlas are emerging as an interesting field of research in their own right , and for statistical purposes it is often desirable to separate the dlas and sub - dlas ( e.g. turnshek & rao 2002 ) .",
    "for these reasons , it is desirable to develop an empirical tool that allows an observer to pre - select candidate absorption systems that are most suitable for their purpose .",
    "therefore , whilst the 2  + 2  ew selection has certainly been the key to identifying the vast majority of low redshift dlas , a more robust separation of dlas and sub - dlas from ground - based spectra would be welcome .",
    "ellison ( 2006 ) proposed a new way to screen 2  absorbers as potential dlas , defining the  as the ratio between 2  ew and velocity width ( see section [ d_sec ] ) . for a sample of 27 absorbers ,",
    "the success rate of the  in selecting dlas was found to be more than a factor of two improvement over the use of ew alone .",
    "however , only eight of the 27 absorbers were sub - dlas , and yet these lower column density absorbers are more abundant than their high  cousins ( e.g. peroux et al .",
    "in this work , we re - visit the assessment of the  as a tool for the pre - selection of dlas based on high resolution spectroscopy of 2  absorbers with an enlarged sample of 56 absorbers .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ d_tab ]    we next consider whether including information from other metal lines may improve the use of @xmath14 to distinguish dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g. meiring et al .",
    "2008 ; peroux et al .",
    "2008 ) that sub - dlas have a tendency to be more metal - rich than dlas .",
    "indeed , there is a lack of high high metallicity systems that empirically manifests itself as an apparent anti - correlation between  and [ zn / h ] ( boisse et al . 1998 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "although it has been argued that this is due to dust bias , this interpretation is not supported by extinction measurements of dlas ( ellison , hall & lira 2005 ) .",
    "simply put , the observed reddening values derived from dla samples ( murphy & liske 2004 ; ellison et al . 2005 ; vladilo , prochaska & wolfe 2008 ) are much lower than would be required to impose a ` dust filter ' .",
    "moreover , it has been argued ( dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2003 ) that the higher metallicities in sub - dlas are not a result of ionization corrections .",
    "as we have shown above , any systematic error in the  of low redshift sub - dlas determined from low resolution spectra is both small , and in the wrong sense to explain the different metallicity distributions . in the absence of any experimental reason ( such as dust bias or ionization correction ) behind the elevated metallicities in sub - dlas",
    ", we explore whether information on the metallicity of an absorber can be combined with the kinematic description encapsulated in eqn [ d_eqn ] to improve the selection success of the .    in figure [ d_vs_feh ]",
    "we show the distribution of [ fe / h ] versus   ( as defined by the 90% ew range for the central absorption component ) for the 49 absorbers for which n(2 ) measurements are available in the literature .",
    "it can be seen that in the regime of high , the dlas have preferentially lower metallicities than the sub - dlas . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] is @xmath16 for sub - dlas and @xmath17 for dlas .",
    "these mean values are calculated by treating the lower limits of the three absorbers with fully saturated 2  profiles as detections .",
    "the difference between the mean metallicities could therefore be even larger .",
    "although the dlas in our sample have a higher mean redshift than the sub - dlas ( see next section ) the evolution of dla metallicity is very mild .",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that the dla metallicity changes by less than 0.3 dex from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . of course",
    ", we can not use the actual metallicity to fine - tune the definition of the , since this requires a measurement of , the very quantity we are hoping to select for .",
    "we therefore consider the use of n(2 ) . in figure [ fe_dist ]",
    "we show histograms of log n(2 ) for the compilation of dlas and sub - dlas in dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "( in prep . ) at @xmath20 ( the redshift regime for which we are trying to develop a selection technique ) .",
    "the column density of 2  is a quantity that can be measured with relative ease from almost any high resolution spectrum suitable for  determination .",
    "there are almost a dozen different 2  transitions with a large dynamic range in @xmath21-value at wavelengths not far from 2 . from figure [ fe_dist ]",
    "we can see that the dlas clearly have systematically higher n(2 ) than the sub - dlas .",
    "the mean log n(2 ) ( and standard deviation ) is 15.15@xmath220.08 for dlas and 14.64@xmath220.07 for sub - dlas .",
    "although the element zinc is usually considered the best indicator of actual metallicity , we emphasize here that we are simply using iron from the empirically motivated viewpoint that its column density is systematically different in dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "we factor n(2 ) into our calculation of the  by multiplying the value derived from eqn [ d_eqn ] by log n(2 ) and dividing by 15 ( to re - scale the d - index ) :    @xmath23    in table [ d_tab ] we give the success and miss rates for this modified  definition , again calculating its value for the six different combinations investigated above and excluding systems which only have n(2 ) limits .",
    "figure [ d_vs_nhi_fe ] shows the distribution of  versus  for our sample using the definition of d given in eqn [ dfe_eqn ] .",
    "although the success rates generally improve slightly ( by a few percent ) when n(2 ) is included , this is not a significant improvement given the modest - sized sample .",
    "the close consistency of success rates with / without n(2 ) included in the calculation is probably due to the small relative difference ( in the log ) between iron column densities .",
    "it is also worth noting that in figure [ d_vs_feh ] there is apparently no correlation between  and [ fe / h ] in dlas , indicating that the does not preferentially select high or low metallicity dlas .",
    "on the other hand , 4/5 sub - dlas with @xmath24 have [ fe / h ] @xmath25 , the highest values in our sample . therefore ,",
    "using low values of @xmath14 to select sub - dlas may miss the highest metallicity absorbers .",
    "we have presented a sample of 56 2  absorbers with known  column densities and investigated techniques to screen for dlas .",
    "the  combines measures of both 2  ew and velocity spread , and we have also investigated incorporating information on the 2  column density .",
    "the results are robust to the various parameterizations that we use , with a typical dla yield of @xmath6 55% , compared to @xmath6 35% when 2  ew alone is used ( rao et al .",
    "the relative insensitivity to the precise definition of the   is reassuring , in the sense that it demonstrates that its success is unlikely to be a fluke of our dataset or choice of parameterization .      given the results in table [ d_tab ] ,",
    "what is the ` best ' definition of @xmath14 ? given the sample size ( and hence , rounding errors in the success and miss rates ) , simply selecting the technique with the best statistics is not necessarily the best choice .",
    "instead , we consider which technique might be the most robust against issues such as noise , resolution and absorber environment .",
    "any of the methods that use the ` full ' velocity range will be sensitive to outlying components that may have nothing to do with the main absorber , e.g. be associated with a satellite galaxy . as discussed in section [ res_sec ] , sub - dlas in particular are known to often have companion absorbers .",
    "s / n is a consideration for techniques that use a 3 @xmath26 cut - off , either over the full absorption range , or just the central complex .",
    "however , ellison ( 2006 ) showed that s / n only significantly degrades the efficiency of  selection in the central absorption component at s / n @xmath27 .",
    "the disadvantage of using the 90% velocity range is that it is sensitive to small differences ( between spectra ) of resolution . as ellison ( 2006 ) showed , this is also the case for a 3 @xmath26 definition .",
    "taking these issues into account , and then re - visiting the statistics of table [ d_tab ] , we suggest that the 90% ew over the central absorption range ( i.e excluding outlying , low ew clouds ) , should be the most robust to these various troubles and yields a high success rate , with only one dla missed . the optimal values of @xmath14 are very similar for the central/90% ew technique whether or not n(2 ) is included  7.0 and 7.2 respectively .",
    "the ks test probability is slightly better when 2  is included .",
    "one potential bias in the evaluation of the  in the current sample is that the redshift distributions of the dlas and sub - dlas are not the same .",
    "the mean dla redshift is @xmath28 , compared with 1.06 for the sub - dlas , with very few of the latter above @xmath29 .",
    "this potential bias can be seen in figures [ d_vs_nhi ] and [ d_vs_nhi_fe ] where the open points show absorbers at @xmath30 .",
    "confining our analysis to absorbers only in this low redshift range includes only 5 dlas with 2  detections , insufficient for robust statistical analysis .",
    "however , mshar et al . ( 2007 ) have shown that neither the ew distribution , nor the velocity spread of strong 2  systems evolves with redshift .",
    "these authors do , however , find differences in the number and distribution of ` subsystems ' between their low and high redshift sample . whilst the low redshift absorbers tend to comprise a single strong absorption component with one satellite subsystem , there are more subsystems in high redshift absorbers , over the same velocity range .",
    "the  is sensitive to such differences .",
    "however , the redshift differences in kinematic structure reported by mshar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and described above can not explain the ` success ' of the  in distinguishing dlas from sub - dlas .",
    "this is because the redshift inequality in our sample is such that we have more dlas at high @xmath7 , where the tendency towards more complex kinematic structure would decrease the .",
    "however , dlas are defined by high values of @xmath14 , i.e. with few kinematically extended subsystems .",
    "further evidence against a redshift bias in our sample comes from ledoux et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who find that , in dlas , the median velocity width of unsaturated metal lines increases with decreasing redshift .",
    "this redshift dependence again works in the opposite sense to a redshift bias that would artificially introduce a  dependence in our work .",
    "therefore , although it is certainly desirable to repeat the tests for a sample of sub - dlas and dlas that are matched in redshift , there is no empirical evidence to suggest that redshift evolution can explain the difference in @xmath14 .    in summary ,",
    "we recommend that the  is calculated using the 90% ew range over the central absorption complex , incorporating n(2 ) , if available , see equation [ dfe_eqn ] . in figure [ d_vs_nhi_fe ]",
    "we show the distribution of  versus  for this choice of parameters .",
    "this figure is directly comparable to figure [ d_vs_nhi ] which uses the same definition of the , but does not include n(2 ) in the calculation .",
    "based on our recommended definition , the ks probability that the @xmath14-indices of sub - dlas and dlas are drawn from the same population is 0.5% . in our sample of 45 absorbers with accurate 2  column densities , 57@xmath31% ( 16/28 ) of systems with @xmath32 7.0 ,",
    "are dlas where the error bars are 1 @xmath26 values taken from gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "only 6% ( 1/17 ) of the dlas in the sample of 45 have @xmath33 .",
    "ellison ( 2006 ) suggested that the  may be driven in part by the qso - galaxy impact parameter . for a galaxy composed of numerous 2  ` clouds ' ,",
    "whose size is of the order of a few kpc ( ellison et al .",
    "2004b ) , the absorption may appear more patchy when the sightline intersects at large impact parameter where the filling factor of these clouds is low .",
    "a sightline passing close to the galaxy s centre will intercept a higher density of absorbing clouds , perhaps with a smaller radial velocity distribution .",
    "this picture is supported by empirical evidence that the ew of 2  absorbers does correlate with impact parameter ( churchill et al .",
    "2000 ; chen & tinker 2008 ) and sub - dlas do have more distinct absorbing components than dlas ( churchill et al . 2000 ) .",
    "another possible source of distinction between the kinematic structure of dlas and sub - dlas is the presence of galactic outflows .",
    "the connection between outflows and a subset of strong 2   absorbers has been discussed in the literature for several years ( e.g. bond et al .",
    "2001 ; ellison , mallen - ornelas & sawicki 2003 ) , although it remains contentious as a general description ( see discussions in bouch et al .",
    "2006 and chen & tinker 2008 ) .",
    "nonetheless , galactic outflows are apparently common in high redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. shapley et al 2003 ; weiner et al .",
    "2008 ) and a growing body of empirical evidence is being published which supports the connection of strong 2  absorbers with winds or outflows .",
    "for example , zibetti et al . ( 2007 ) find that the mean impact parameter of 2  absorbers in the sdss is about 50 kpc from a l@xmath34 galaxy .",
    "one explanation for this observation is that the absorption detected in qso spectra corresponds to material that is in a large extended region , possibly associated with winds .",
    "mnard & chelouche ( 2008 ) also argue for the connection of 2  absorbers to massive galaxies based on their gas - to - dust ratios , which are an order of magnitude higher than values for dlas ( murphy & liske 2004 ; ellison et al .",
    "2005 ; vladilo et al .",
    "murphy et al . ( 2007 ) observed a significant correlation between 2  ew and metallicity and concluded that ` [ there is ] a strong link between absorber metallicity and the mechanism for producing and dispersing the velocity components ' .",
    "finally , kacprzak et al . ( 2007 ) have shown that there is a correlation between the 2  ew and the degree of asymetry in the host galaxy .",
    "however , it does not necessarily flow that _ all _ strong 2   absorbers are connected with outflows .",
    "both bouch ( 2008 ) and mnard & chelouche ( 2008 ) have recently suggested that , when plotted in the -2  ew plane , there are two separate absorber populations distinguished by metallicity .",
    "this effect is also seen in figure [ d_vs_feh ] where the high  absorbers are fairly cleanly separated into high metallicity sub - dlas and low metallicity dlas .",
    "bouch ( 2008 ) proposes that the more metal - rich , lower  absorbers at a given 2  ew are associated with galactic outflows . in turn",
    ", this may lead to kinematics that are more patchy in velocity space ( e.g. ellison et al . 2003 ) and contribute to the mechanism behind the success of the .",
    "the  requires moderately high resolution spectra to yield accurate pre - selection .",
    "therefore , whilst ew - only dla pre - selection can exploit the truly enormous datasets of , for example , the sdss ( e.g. rao & turnshek 2000 ; rao et al .",
    "2006 ) , what is the niche for the ?",
    "individual groups have already used moderately large datasets for 2searches at high resolution .",
    "the two most recent surveys for strong 2  absorbers in high resolution spectra are mshar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( 56 absorbers with @xmath1 2796 ew @xmath9 0.3  ) and prochter et al .",
    "( 2006a ) ( 21 absorbers with 2  @xmath1 2796 ew @xmath9 1  ) .",
    "given that the number density of 2   @xmath1 2796 ew @xmath9 0.6   absorbers is a factor 2 larger than at 1  , these two samples would already yield over 50 absorbers suitable for  screening ( not accounting for an overlap between the samples ) .",
    "however , these samples are small compared to the full archival power that could be applied .",
    "after a decade of high resolution spectroscopy with hires on keck and uves at the vlt , and a somewhat shorter , but extremely productive history with esi , we estimate that 500  700 qsos have been observed at moderate  high resolution ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "if we assume an average emission redshift @xmath35=2.5 for 500 qsos , and maximum wavelength coverage of 8500  , this yields a redshift path of almost 760 .",
    "the number density of strong 2  absorbers has been robustly determined from sdss spectra ( e.g. nestor et al .",
    "2005 ; prochter et al .",
    "for example , nestor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the number density of 2  @xmath1 2796 ew @xmath9 0.6   absorbers ( a typical ew suitable for dla pre - selection ) at @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "this value is unlikely to be affected due to magnitude bias ( ellison et al .",
    "2004a ) and can therefore also be applied to high resolution spectra . the total number of such absorbers that we could therefore expect to find in existing moderate",
    " high resolution spectra is therefore approaching 400 . even though follow - up observations with space telescopes are likely to focus on the brightest in this sample , the typical magnitude limit for echelle spectroscopy with an 8-m ground - based telescope is close to the limit that will be feasible for the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and the renovated stis .",
    "the  may also be useful for assessing the nature of absorption where follow - up observations of  are not even possible .",
    "for example , in the spectra of grbs . as observatories ( and observers )",
    "fine - tune their rapid follow - up techniques , there is a growing database of bright grbs that have been observed promptly at high resolution ( e.g. vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 ; ellison et al . 2007",
    "; prochaska et al .",
    "2  absorbers detected in these spectra that do not have  covered , have no chance of susbsequent follow - up due to the rapid fading of the optical afterglow , but their likelihood of being dlas can still be assessed , ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "2006 ; prochaska et al .",
    "the application to grb spectra is particularly interesting given the possibility of deep searches for the absorbing galaxy after the optical afterglow has faded . even at low redshifts ,",
    "the study of dla host galaxies has been challenging with qso impact parameters of 12 arcseconds ( e.g. chen & lanzetta 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "identifying probable dlas in grb spectra opens the door to host galaxy searches to unprecedented depths .    finally , in light of the recent puzzling result by prochter et al .",
    "( 2006b ) that intervening 2  absorbers are more numerous towards grb sightlines than qso sightlines , it would also be interesting to compare the distribution of @xmath14-indices of these two populations .",
