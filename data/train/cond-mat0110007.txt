    "as was emphasized by feynman@xcite among others , the physics of superfluidity lies not in the presence of gapless excitations , but in the paucity of gapless excitations .",
    "after all , the fermi liquid has a continuum of gapless modes .",
    "indeed , consider a gas of free bosons at zero temperature .",
    "we can give a momentum @xmath9 to any given boson at the cost of only @xmath10 in energy .",
    "there exist many low energy excitations in a free boson system .",
    "but as soon as a short - ranged repulsion is turned on between the bosons , a boson moving with momentum @xmath11 would affect all the other bosons .",
    "a density wave is set up as a result .",
    "as bogoliubov and others have taught us , the density wave has energy @xmath12 .",
    "the gapless mode has gone from quadratically dispersing to linearly dispersing .",
    "there are far fewer low energy excitations .",
    "specifically , the density of states @xmath13 goes from @xmath14 constant to @xmath15 at low energies .",
    "here we have set the dimension of space @xmath16 to 2 .",
    "if we accept the point of view that the key ingredient of superfluidity is the existence of _ only _ one mode of gapless excitations , then we can use this picture to give a semi - quantitative description of superfluid . as the above discussion makes clear ,",
    "the linearly dispersing gapless mode is a density wave . as landau first proposed , such a density fluctuation can be described hydrodynamically .",
    "the kinetic energy density is then simply given by the square of the current density @xmath17 , while the potential energy density is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the deviation of number density @xmath20 from some mean density @xmath21 .",
    "thus , suppressing some constant factors ( which we can set to unity by a suitable choice of spacetime units ) , we have the effective lagrangian for the superfluid @xmath22 where as always in an effective lagrangian description the @xmath23 represent physics that are not important at low energy and momentum . suppressing the @xmath24 on @xmath19 and using the relativistic notation",
    "@xmath25 we can write @xmath26    a crucial physical principle underlying a hydrodynamic description is of course current conservation @xmath27 or in relativistic notation @xmath28 this conservation equation is solved by writing @xmath29 we recognize the symbol @xmath30 as representing a gauge potential since the transformation @xmath31 leaves the physical current @xmath32 and hence physics unchanged .",
    "the relation ( [ current ] ) is an example of a duality relation .",
    "upon substituting ( [ current ] ) into ( [ hydro ] ) we obtain the effective lagrangian in terms of the gauge potential @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to ( [ max ] ) as the maxwell lagrangian since it has the same form as the lagrangian introduced by maxwell to describe electromagnetism .",
    "we could have described the gapless linearly dispersing mode by the equation of motion @xmath36 and thus gone to ( [ max ] ) directly .",
    "however , it would have been unclear why we would need a spin 1 field to describe one gapless mode , even though it is true that in @xmath37 dimensional spacetime a spin @xmath38 field contains only one physical degree of freedom .",
    "this gapless mode is in fact a nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "since the only locally conserved quantity in our interacting bose gas is the number density @xmath20 associated with a global @xmath4 symmetry , this global symmetry must be spontaneously broken .",
    "this is indeed so as the number of bosons in the @xmath39 ground state is a finite fraction of the total number of bosons .",
    "the physics of gapless mode is particularly transparent in bogoliubov s calculation .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the annihilation and creation operators for bosons in the @xmath39 non - interacting ground state . in the interaction term",
    "@xmath42 in the hamiltonian @xmath43 bogoliubov replaces @xmath40 and @xmath41 by @xmath44numbers @xmath45 thus giving schematically @xmath46 clearly , we get a gapless mode since up to an additive constant the first term can be written as @xmath47 and so @xmath48 creates a gapless excitation of momentum @xmath49 the crucial point is that @xmath50 and not merely @xmath51 : in that case we would only get a gapped mode with energy @xmath52 .    formally , the @xmath4 symmetry breaking can be described by a field theoretic representation of the boson gas @xmath53 a superfluid is defined as a fluid in which @xmath54 does not vanish .",
    "as is well known , this breaks the global @xmath4 symmetry @xmath55 of the lagrangian @xmath56 . in this language , it is possible to describe the gapless linearly dispersing mode by a scalar field and to write @xmath57 where the phase field is the phase of the field @xmath58 .",
    "we note that the lagrangian ( [ max ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) describe the same superfluid mode and the two theories are dual to each other .",
    "the hall fluid is another highly coherent quantum state . to see how the low energy effective theories of the hall fluid and of the superfluid differ from each other , we need to understand the correlations in the quantum hall ground state .",
    "the simplest kind of hall fluid with filling fraction @xmath59 is described by the ground state wave function proposed by laughlin @xmath60 with @xmath61 an odd integer .",
    "this highly non - trivial wave function captures the strong quantum correlation between particles .",
    "as electron @xmath62 goes around electron @xmath63 the wave function acquires a factor @xmath64 as is well known but still worth emphasizing , the essential physics involved is purely quantum in character and has no classical counterpart .",
    "this quantum phase correlation is the same as in the aharonov - bohm effect and so the particles in ( [ lau ] ) can be regarded as carrying both charge and flux associated with some gauge field . as was shown by wilczek and zee@xcite , this phase correlation can be expressed mathematically as a hopf term which in turn can be generated by a chern - simons term in the gauge action .",
    "the phase correlation can also be viewed as a density - current interaction .",
    "the origin of the hopf and chern - simon terms can be easily understood in physical terms within the context of this discussion .",
    "when electron @xmath62 goes around electron @xmath63 , we have a current @xmath17 around a charge density @xmath65 ( as before , we drop the @xmath66 ) , and so the action @xmath67 should contain a non - local term of the form @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 in addition to the terms in ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "such a term describes a non - local current - density interaction .",
    "the kernel @xmath72 can be determined from basic principles .",
    "rotational invariance and scale invariance fix this term to be @xmath73 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath74 @xmath75 or in relativistic form @xmath76 we have scale invariance because we know that the phase factor @xmath77 does not depend on the separation between particles @xmath62 and @xmath63 : there is no characteristic distance in the quantum phase correlation .",
    "note that the cross product @xmath78 is forced on us by rotational invariance and current conservation : if instead we wrote @xmath79 we would have a density density interaction instead .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath73 violates time reversal .",
    "the non - locality of the hopf action can be removed by introducing a gauge potential @xmath80 to represent @xmath81 ( see ( [ current ] ) ) . after substituting @xmath82 with @xmath83 ,",
    "the hopf term becomes the chern - simons term : @xmath84 thus , the effective action for the @xmath85 laughlin state is @xmath86 where we have restored the coefficient of the maxwell term ( which we should strictly write in non - relativistic form as @xmath87 with some characteristic velocity @xmath88 ) .",
    "this effective action@xcite reproduces the correct hall conductance @xmath89 if we include the coupling to the electromagnetic gauge potential @xmath90 by adding @xmath91 to @xmath56 .",
    "the quantum correlation ( or the density - current interaction ) is not a potential energy between particles and thus can not be expressed in energetic terms .",
    "this physical observation is manifested mathematically by the fact that the chern - simons term contains only the levi - civita symbol @xmath92 and does not contain the metric @xmath93 and so according to einstein the corresponding term in the hamiltonian is identically zero .",
    "since the chern - simons term contains only one spacetime derivative @xmath94 while the maxwell term @xmath95 contains two , the chern - simons term completely dominates the maxwell term at low energy and momentum .",
    "the effective theory of @xmath85 laughlin state can be written as @xmath96    counting powers of derivatives in @xmath97 , we see that the inverse propagator for a gauge boson of energy - momentum @xmath98 has the schematic form ( we suppress lorentz indices and display only the power of momentum ) @xmath99 and thus the propagator has a pole at @xmath100 the gauge boson has a mass @xmath101 or in non - relativistic terms the spectrum of the hall fluid has a gap @xmath101 . in the limit @xmath102 the spectrum contains only zero - energy ground states .",
    "as is well known by now , @xmath103 is an example of a topological field theory .",
    "the only physical question we can ask of the spectrum is how many ground states there are given appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "with various spatial boundary conditions , the theory is effectively compactified on riemann surfaces of genus @xmath104 ( not to be confused with the maxwell coupling of course . )",
    "the question is then the topological ground state degeneracy@xcite @xmath16 as a function of the genus @xmath105    contrast @xmath97 with @xmath106 .",
    "the presence of the chern - simons term ( or equivalently , the density - current interaction ) completely overwhelms the maxwell term .",
    "there is no gapless mode in the bulk .",
    "the hall fluid is incompressible and the only gapless modes must reside on the edge@xcite .",
    "given the above discussion it would seem surprising that quantum hall systems can under some circumstances contain a superfluid .",
    "we will now explain how this could happen in a double layered system .",
    "conceptually , it is clearer to start with no ( or better , an infinitesimal ) interlayer tunneling .    in a double layered system",
    "we can associate a separate gauge potential @xmath107 ( @xmath108 with each layer .",
    "this is because in the absence of tunneling the current in each layer is separately conserved and thus we can write ( [ current ] ) separately for each layer : @xmath109 @xmath110 thus , the effective lagrangian ( [ hall ] ) is naturally generalized to @xmath111 we have merely put layer indices on the various fields . significantly , however , the number @xmath61 has been promoted to a matrix @xmath1 . over the years , we and others@xcite have studied this @xmath1-matrix description of quantum hall fluids . in particular , we find that all abelian quantum hall fluids can be classified by the @xmath1-matrices@xcite .    with the matrix @xmath112 @xmath97 describes the double - layered @xmath113 state with the wave function @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote the coordinates of the electrons in layer 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "note that the factor @xmath117 describes a subtle quantum correlation between the two layers .",
    "in general the effective theory @xmath97 describes a quantum hall state with finite energy gap .",
    "but when @xmath118 , the matrix @xmath1 can have a zero eigenvalue !",
    "the corresponding eigenvector now describes a linear combination of gauge potentials , @xmath119 , which is no longer governed at low energy and momentum by the chern - simons term , but by the maxwell term .",
    "thus the low energy effective theory for the @xmath5 quantum hall state is identical to the low energy effective theory of a superfluid ( [ max ] ) .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath120 corresponds to a gapless linearly dispersing mode .",
    "thus , the double layered @xmath0 quantum hall state is in fact a superfluid state .",
    "conceptually , this is associated with the appearance of an off - diagonal long range order cause by a spontaneously broken @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the broken symmetry can be identified by noting that @xmath120 describe the fluctuations of the difference of the electron numbers @xmath121 in the two layers .",
    "thus it is the symmetry associated with the conservation of @xmath122 that is broken in the @xmath0 state .    in the broken symmetry phase , the order parameter @xmath123 is non - zero even in the absence of interlayer tunneling ( here @xmath124 and @xmath125 denote the electron annihilation operator in layer 1 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the angle field @xmath126 give rise to a gapless mode described by the standard x - y model for any @xmath4 symmetry breaking phase : @xmath127 here @xmath128 may be thought of as the capacitance per unit area between the two layers .",
    "the @xmath4 gauge description allows us to conclude that any quantum hall state with det@xmath129 may have a spontaneously broken @xmath4 symmetry and exhibit superfluidity / superconductivity .",
    "this result is much more general than the one obtained from the isospin approach@xcite .",
    "the x - y model description is more convenient for studying interlayer tunneling .",
    "when interlayer tunneling is `` switched '' on , the @xmath4 symmetry associated with @xmath121 is explicitly broken . in the limit of weak tunneling amplitude",
    ", we obtain the effective lagrangian by including the tunneling term @xmath130 : @xmath131 various physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the @xmath126 field@xcite .",
    "the difference in electron density @xmath132 and the difference in electron current density @xmath133 between the two layers are given by @xmath134 the tunneling current density between the two layers is given by @xmath135 the voltage difference between the two layers is @xmath136    we see that a static solution @xmath137 corresponds to a finite tunneling current @xmath138 even for vanishing voltage difference between the two layers .",
    "this is reminiscent of the dc josephson effect in the tunneling between two superconductors , but as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a crucial difference . in the case of two superconductors",
    ", we have instead of ( [ w2 ] ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 scales with the volume of the superconductors and @xmath141 with the area of the contact between the superconductors .",
    "in contrast , in ( [ w2 ] ) @xmath128 and @xmath141 both scale with the area of the quantum hall system .",
    "thus , in the double layered quantum hall system interlayer tunneling opens up a finite energy gap @xmath142 in the case of two superconductors , the would - be energy gap scales to @xmath143 in the limit of large system size .",
    "in this section we would like to consider how to experimentally test the prediction that a small interlayer tunneling current does not induce any voltage drop between the two layers for the @xmath0 state at @xmath144 .",
    "this test is important , since the dc josephson - like effect we predicted in @xcite is still a controversial issue .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath3 state does not have any josephson effect in the presence of interlayer tunneling .",
    "one way to test the zero voltage drop is through a sample with the geometry described in fig .",
    "the middle region is occupied by the @xmath0 state , and the left and the right region by a metallic state ( _ e.g. _ the @xmath145 state ) in the first and second layer respectively .",
    "the metallic state in the r and l region serve as ohmic contacts to the first and second layer in the @xmath0 state .",
    "one voltage probe is attached to an edge of the @xmath0 state in the first layer , and the other attached to the edge on the same side in the second layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as we pass a current from the right region to the left region , the current must tunnel through the barrier between the two layer . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , if the current is less than a critical value ( here we assume a uniform interlayer tunneling ) , the system is described by a time - independent @xmath146 in ( [ w2 ] ) . from ( [ w5 ] ) , we see that such a static configuration does not induce any voltage between the two layers . in other words ,",
    "the voltage drop between two probes in the two layers would be zero if the probes are on top of each other ( _ i.e. _ have the same @xmath147-@xmath148 coordinates ) .",
    "however , such probes are hard to make in experiments .",
    "since the interlayer tunneling induces a finite energy gap in the bulk of the sample , the chiral edge state does not have any voltage drop along a single edge .",
    "thus we can place the two probes at different place along the edge , as shown in fig .",
    "the voltage drop between the two voltage probes should be zero .",
    "for a larger current beyond a critical value , a non - zero voltage drop will be developed .",
    "the striking feature is that the voltage drop is zero even for weak interlayer tunneling .",
    "weak interlayer tunneling only leads to a small critical current .",
    "we would like to make four remarks .",
    "( 1 ) if the second voltage probe is attached to the edge on the other side of the sample from the first voltage probe , a non - zero voltage drop will appear due to the non - zero hall resistance .",
    "( 2 ) the vanishing of the voltage drop between the two leads is a consequence of the superfluidity , not of the chirality of the edge excitations ( _ i.e. _ the absence of back propagating modes ) . to illustrate this point",
    "let us replace the @xmath0 state in the middle region by a @xmath149 state , which does not have any superfluidity ( _ i.e. _ its @xmath1-matrix does not have a zero eigenvalue ) .",
    "there is no quantum coherence between the two separate @xmath150 states in the two layers .",
    "now interlayer tunneling is controlled by tunneling between the two edges of the two @xmath150 states . in this case",
    "a finite current will produce a finite voltage drop between the two layers and hence between the two voltage probes .",
    "if the edges are sharp on the scale of the magnetic length , we have@xcite @xmath151 at zero temperature @xmath144 and @xmath152.(3 ) in the strong tunneling limit , the @xmath0 state crosses over to a single layered @xmath153 state .",
    "the zero voltage drop between the two leads is just the standard result @xmath154 for fractional quantum hall states .",
    "this correct cross - over behavior from the weak to the strong tunneling limit further confirms the validity of our results.(4 ) if the interlayer tunneling is not uniform , the flux trapped between the layers should be pinned to observe the dc josephson - like effect@xcite .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to mention that in a two - terminal measurement as arranged in fig .",
    "1 , the measured two - terminal resistance should be exactly @xmath155 for the @xmath0 state if the current is smaller than a critical value .",
    "note that the small - current two - terminal resistance is always @xmath155 regardless the strength the interlayer tunneling amplitude , despite the tunneling current flows across the interlayer junction .",
    "this resembles the zero dc resistance of a josephson junction between two superconductors at small currents .",
    "a small interlayer tunneling only reduces the value of the critical current . for current beyond the critical value",
    ", the two - terminal resistance will become very large in the weak tunneling limit .",
    "recently kellogg _ et al_@xcite has observed a quantized hall drag resistance in @xmath3 state , as predicted by several groups.@xcite here we would like to show that quantized hall drag resistance can be easily obtained using the @xmath1-matrix chern - simon effective theory .",
    "this allows us to calculate the hall drag for any abelian quantum hall state characterized by @xmath1 .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a double layer state characterized by a @xmath156 @xmath1-matrix .",
    "the effective theory is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 , @xmath159 , is the electromagnetic gauge potential in the @xmath160 layer . from the equation of motion",
    ", we find that the induced current in the two layers , @xmath161 , are given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the electric field in the @xmath160 layer , and @xmath164",
    ". we can define the hall drag resistance , @xmath165 , as the coefficiant that determine the hall voltage in the @xmath160 layer induced by the current in the @xmath166 layer @xmath167 we find @xmath165 is given by @xmath168 the above result applies to any double - layer quantum hall state characterized by the @xmath156 @xmath1-matrix .",
    "it is interesting to see that the @xmath1-matrix can be directly measured via the hall drag matrix . for the @xmath113 state , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 .",
    "we have @xmath171 which is exactly what was observed by kellogg _",
    "et al _ for the @xmath3 state .",
    "the superfluidity / superconductivity in certain quantum hall state reveals a subtle quantum correlation . using the @xmath1-matrix description of the quantum hall states",
    ", we can identify exactly which quantum hall states have such special correlation .",
    "we find that if @xmath1 has a zero eigenvalue , then the corresponding quantum hall state may have a spontaneously broken @xmath4 symmetry and the associated superfluidity / superconductivity . the picture presented in this paper",
    "reveal the basic physics behind the superfluidity / superconductivity in quantum hall states .",
    "our formalism can be applied to more general quantum hall systems well beyond the double layer system , to multi - layered systems for example .",
    "we also proposed a concrete four - terminal test for the dc josephson - like effect .",
    "we hope that the controversy around the superfluidity / superconductivity in the @xmath0 state and the dc josephson - like effect in the interlayer tunneling can be settled by experiments .",
    "also we would like to point out that observing the ac josephson - like effect ( a peak at @xmath172 in the noise spectrum of interlayer tunneling current ) will truly reveal the unusual correlation in the @xmath0 state .",
