    "distorted black holes emit gravitational radiation as a discrete sum of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , damped oscillations whose frequencies and damping times depend only on the black hole s mass and angular momentum .",
    "the qnm frequencies scale with the inverse of the black hole s mass .",
    "therefore , the optimal sensitivity bandwidth of each detector determines the mass range that can be detected .",
    "the dominant qnm frequency for quadrupolar radiation from a schwarzschild black hole is @xmath1  hz . as a consequence , the collapse of population - iii stars with mass @xmath2 or @xmath3 forms massive black hole remnants that could be detectable by ground - based , high - frequency gravitational wave interferometers such as the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite and virgo @xcite . the space - based laser interferometer space antenna ( ) ,",
    "being sensitive in the frequency band @xmath4  hz , will detect the gravitational radiation emitted by oscillating black holes of mass @xmath5 with large signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) throughout the observable universe @xcite . with large snr",
    "come precise measurements of the source parameters , and an extraordinary opportunity to study the physics of massive black holes @xcite .",
    "since the  snr can be very large , more than one mode could be detected in the ringdown waveform .",
    "such a detection would allow an unprecedented test of the black hole nature of the source .",
    "the basic idea is quite simple . in general relativity",
    "the complex qnm frequencies form a discrete set @xmath6 classified by three integers : the indices @xmath7 come from the separation of the angular dependence of the perturbations , and the index @xmath8 labels frequencies by the magnitude of their imaginary part ( large @xmath8 means large imaginary part and short damping time ) . because of the `` no - hair theorem '' , qnm frequencies depend only on the mass and angular momentum of a kerr black hole . roughly speaking ,",
    "the measurement of one complex frequency ( two observables ) provides us with a determination of the mass and angular momentum of the black hole , and the measurement of the second frequency allows a consistency check with the general relativistic predictions @xcite .",
    "the detectability of different qnms depends on the relative qnm excitation , which in turn is determined by the cause of the perturbation ( i.e. by the initial data ) .",
    "given a detection , the resolvability of different modes depends on the nature of the multimode ringdown waveform .",
    "two scenarios are possible @xcite .",
    "if @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( the modes have different angular dependence ) the angular scalar product between the modes is zero to a good approximation @xcite , and the snr can be expressed as a sum in quadrature of the single - mode snrs . in @xcite",
    "we called these multimode ringdown waveforms _ quasi - orthonormal_. if instead @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but @xmath13 ( we look at different overtones with the same angular dependence ) the angular scalar product is very close to unity , and mixed terms appear in the snr calculation and in calculations of parameter estimation accuracy .",
    "we may call these waveforms _ quasi - parallel_.    a quantitative estimate of the relative qnm excitation for quasi - orthonormal waveforms will require numerical relativistic simulations and realistic initial data for the merger @xcite . however , for quasi - parallel waveforms perturbation theory ( combined with a good approximation to the initial data for ringdown ) can provide useful information on the relative excitation of different overtones . in this paper , using perturbation theory , we develop tools to estimate the relative excitation of different overtones of kerr black holes for general classes of initial data",
    ". we also try to gain some theoretical insight into the initial - data dependence of the results for realistic mergers , considering simple classes of initial data ( such as localized spikes and gaussians ) as model problems .",
    "our work is the first application to gravitational perturbations of kerr black holes of a theoretical framework developed over the years by different authors . following the pioneering numerical analysis by vishveshwara @xcite , who studied the scattering of gaussian wave pulses on the schwarzschild background , a number of studies investigated the analytical structure of the green s function that propagates small perturbations in black hole geometries .",
    "our own analysis is based on the formalism developed by leaver in the eighties @xcite , but the green s function in the schwarzschild background has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "more recently glampedakis and andersson extended the analysis to _ scalar _ perturbations of kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "here we carry out the first study of general - spin perturbations of kerr black holes , including the physically most important case of gravitational perturbations .",
    "the main result emerging from @xcite is that a `` universal '' ( initial - data independent ) measure of the relative qnm excitation is encoded in the poles of the green s function that propagates small perturbations of the geometry .",
    "these `` universal '' _ quasinormal excitation factors _ ( qnefs ) are defined in eq .",
    "( [ excfactors ] ) below .",
    "they depend only on the kerr geometry , not on the details of the perturbation .",
    "when combined with a knowledge of the initial data they can be used to compute the so - called _ quasinormal excitation coefficients _ defined in eq .",
    "( [ exccoeffs ] ) , which are a concrete measure of the qnm content of a waveform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ string ] , to develop some physical intuition , we consider a very simple physical system : a vibrating string with fixed ends .",
    "this part provides a useful pedagogical introduction to the qnm excitation problem , and may be skipped by readers familiar with the topic .",
    "we consider the green s function solution of the vibrating string equation for generic initial data , identify the normal modes of the system as poles of the green s function and show the importance of initial data to determine the excitation of the modes . in sec .",
    "[ bholes ] we show that many features of the vibrating string problem carry over to black hole perturbation theory , stressing the main differences between normal mode expansions and qnm expansions .",
    "we also anticipate some results on the convergence of the qnefs , which are presented in more detail in appendix [ app : asymptbn ] . in sec .",
    "[ bn ] we outline our calculation of the qnefs , present the numerical results and compute the response of a kerr black hole to localized and gaussian initial data .",
    "technical details , as well as a discussion of the numerical accuracy of our calculations , are relegated to appendix [ app : tech ] .",
    "appendix [ app : sn ] clarifies the relation between the teukolsky and sasaki - nakamura ( sn ) formulations of the kerr perturbation equations , and between the corresponding qnefs .",
    "some key features of the black hole perturbation problem we address in this paper are exemplified by a very simple system : a vibrating string with fixed ends . to simplify the mathematics we pick units so that the velocity of the waves in the string @xmath14 , and consider a string of length @xmath15 .",
    "then any disturbance of the string obeys the wave equation = 0x , [ flatwave ] with @xmath16 .",
    "the general solution of this problem is easily verified to be u(t , x)=_n=1^ ( |c_n + |c_n ) , [ gensolstring ] where we used an overbar to avoid confusion with the _ quasinormal _ excitation coefficients @xmath17 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ exccoeffs ] ) below . in fourier language",
    "we say the general solution is a superposition of normal modes with sinusoidal dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath19 , labeled by an integer @xmath8 .",
    "each mode has frequency @xmath20 .    for the general solution to be useful we must determine the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 , that is",
    ", we must determine the _ contribution of each individual mode_. this contribution can easily be computed once we are given _ initial data _",
    ", namely the initial configuration @xmath23 and velocity profile @xmath24 of the string . indeed , consider ( [ gensolstring ] ) and its first derivative , both evaluated at @xmath25 .",
    "multiplying both sides by @xmath26 and integrating on @xmath27 we get |c_n=_0^u_0(x)nx dx ,     in more general situations it is not possible to find closed - form elementary solutions satisfying some given boundary conditions ( in our vibrating string example , the fixed ends condition ) .",
    "however , an elegant formal solution can be obtained using green s functions .",
    "let us consider a slight generalization of eq .",
    "( [ flatwave ] ) : - -v(x)u = s,[waveeq - gen ] where we introduced a potential @xmath28 and a source @xmath29 representing , say , external forces acting on the system ( for a free vibrating string @xmath30 ) .",

    "then the previous equation shows that , given @xmath36 ( which means , in the absence of external forces , given initial data ) we can determine , at least in principle , the solution .",
    "there is a general prescription to construct the green s function @xcite .",
    "find two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation , say @xmath37 and @xmath38 , each satisfying one of the required boundary conditions : for the vibrating string these solutions would be such that @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "the bottom line of this discussion is that the general solution depends crucially on two elements : ( i ) the residues of the green s function evaluated at the poles ( that is , at the normal frequencies ) ; ( ii ) the function @xmath52 , which ( in the absence of initial forces ) is nothing but the initial data . by inspection",

    "we will see below that a similar result holds for the ringdown of kerr black holes .      in the previous section we pointed out that initial data play a crucial role to determine the excitation of the normal modes of a system .",
    "for illustration , below we consider three simple examples that will be useful in the following to understand , by analogy , the initial - data dependence of the excitation of a kerr black hole .",
    "suppose first that we have an ( initially stationary ) plucked string : the string s initial profile is a triangle of height @xmath56 with a vertex at @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 and u_0(x)=\\ {    ll & , +   + & .    .",

    "notice also that the `` excitation factors '' @xmath61 decrease as @xmath62 .    as",
    "a second example take stationary , localized `` @xmath63-function '' initial data of the form u_0(x)=(x - x^s),v_0(x)=0.the excitation factors are trivially computed :    comparable amplitude except for modes with a node at the plucking point , which are not excited at all .",
    "our third and last example are stationary , gaussian initial data : u_0(x)=e^-b(x - x^s)^2 , v_0(x)=0.for large @xmath64 the gaussian is strongly peaked at @xmath65 , in which case the contribution to the integral outside of @xmath66 can be ignored and we have |c_n=_0^u_0(x)nx dx _ -^e^-b(x - x^s)^2nx dx = e^-n^2/(4b ) [ stringexc ] therefore a mode with given @xmath8 is maximally excited when the width of the gaussian satisfies the condition @xmath67 .",
    "a similar result will be seen to hold for gaussians exciting kerr black holes .",
    "the basic lesson we learn from these examples is that the excitation of a system is very sensitive to the initial data .",
    "more specifically , whether a given mode is excited or not depends strongly on the point where we excite the system ( `` pluck the string '' ) .",
    "in the sn formalism @xcite , perturbations of a kerr black hole induced by a spin-@xmath68 field are described by a single function @xmath69 whose laplace transform satisfies + v_snx^(s)(,r)=i(,r ) , [ potbh1 ] where the effective potential @xmath70 depends both on the radial coordinate and on the frequency .",
    "the function @xmath71 is a linear combination of the sn function @xmath72 and its time derivative @xmath73 at time @xmath74 ( see below for the explicit expression for scalar perturbations ) .",
    "the tortoise coordinate @xmath75 is defined by the condition = , ranging from @xmath76 ( the location of the event horizon ) to @xmath77 ( spatial infinity ) .",

    "the class of problems that fit in this description include any massless field in the kerr geometry , including gravitational , electromagnetic and scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the main difference with the vibrating string example is that our system is not conservative : waves can escape to infinity .",
    "for this reason an expansion in normal modes is not possible ( see @xcite for extensive discussions of this point ) .",
    "wave propagation is also complicated by backscattering off the background curvature , which is responsible for tail effects @xcite . despite these complications",
    "it can be shown that the poles of the green s function ( now located at complex frequencies corresponding to the qnms ) still play an important role in the evolution .",
    "the qnm contribution can be isolated from other features of the signal , such as the late - time tail , using the green s function technique @xcite .",

    "an important difference that distinguishes black hole spacetimes is that there is now an essential singularity at @xmath89 and a branch cut extending from the singularity to @xmath90 @xcite . to prevent the essential singularity from lying inside the integration contour",

    "the well - known fact that ringdown waveforms only make sense for certain values of @xmath19 is usually referred to as the `` time - shift problem '' @xcite . for illustration , consider eq .",

    "<S> distorted black holes radiate gravitational waves . in the so - called ringdown phase radiation </S>",
    "<S> is emitted as a discrete set of complex quasinormal frequencies , whose values depend only on the black hole s mass and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> ringdown radiation could be detectable with large signal - to - noise ratio by the laser interferometer space antenna ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> if more than one mode is detected , tests of the black hole nature of the source become possible . </S>",
    "<S> the detectability of different modes depends on their relative excitation , which in turn depends on the cause of the perturbation ( i.e. on the initial data ) . </S>",
    "<S> a `` universal '' , initial data - independent measure of the relative mode excitation is encoded in the poles of the green s function that propagates small perturbations of the geometry ( `` excitation factors '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the excitation factors for general - spin perturbations of kerr black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for corotating modes with @xmath0 the excitation factors tend to zero in the extremal limit , and that the contribution of the overtones should be more significant when the black hole is fast rotating . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the first analytical calculation of the large - damping asymptotics of the excitation factors for static black holes , including the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm metrics . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important step to determine the convergence properties of the quasinormal mode expansion . </S>"
