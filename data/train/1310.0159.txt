    "gauge - gravity dualities like the ads / cft correspondence @xcite make it possible to study the properties of conformal fields in a particular dimension @xmath0 by studying the evolution of fields in a black hole spacetime that is asymptotically ads in @xmath1 dimensions and this has led to considerable interest in the study of asymptotically ads black hole spacetimes .",
    "the main difficulty in studying field evolution in such spacetimes is that the stability of the spacetime against perturbations is not always guaranteed , unlike in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes in first order theories in four dimensions .",
    "the instability of linear perturbations in higher - order and higher dimensional theories has already been investigated @xcite .",
    "the instability also extends to the thermodynamics of the black hole when we consider ads spacetimes , with the well - known hawking - page phase transitions @xcite signaling a transition between the black hole spacetime and thermal ads spacetime .",
    "recent studies @xcite on the lovelock model have confirmed the existence of dynamic instability against metric perturbations in asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes .",
    "dynamic instability means that the solutions to the equation for the metric perturbation become unstable outside the event horizon for large values of their eigenvalue .",
    "this instability exists for all types of metric perturbations - tensor , vector and scalar .",
    "these instabilities occur when the mass of the black hole falls below a lower critical bound that depends on the coupling constants , the dimension of the spacetime and the order of the theory . + quasi normal modes are damped oscillations ( having complex frequencies ) , known to dominate the intermediate stage of the evolution of small perturbations of a black hole spacetime and have been studied extensively .",
    "detailed reviews and methods of calculation of quasi normal modes are found in numerous papers that include @xcite .",
    "quasi normal modes are known to depend only on the parameters of the black hole , such as mass , charge and angular momentum , and be completely independent of the type of the agent that caused it .",
    "these modes are obtained as the solution of the respective field equation , when solved with respect to the metric that describes the particular black hole spacetime of interest . in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes ,",
    "the effective potential that is perceived by the field in the spacetime often resembles a finite potential barrier such that the potential vanishes at infinity .",
    "this leads to the possibility of obtaining solutions that are purely ingoing at the event horizon of the black hole and purely outgoing at infinity , both resembling plane waves when expressed in terms of a scaled co - ordinate called the tortoise co - ordinate .",
    "these modes may be observed in the future with the aid of gravitational detectors . in the case of asymptotically ads spacetimes , however , the potential grows indefinitely at infinity .",
    "therefore , one usually looks for solutions that vanish at infinity , while the boundary condition at the event horizon unchanged @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the case of pure ads spacetime , where the potential effectively confines the field as if `` in a box '' and solutions exist only with a discrete spectrum of real frequencies .",
    "even though black holes in asymptotically ads spacetimes are not believed to exist in nature , interest in studying their quasi normal modes stems from the above - mentioned ads / cft correspondence @xcite . according to the ads / cft correspondence , these perturbations correspond to perturbations of the thermal state of the strongly coupled conformal field at the boundary of the spacetime and the quasi normal modes correspond to the return to thermal equilibrium , so that the quasi normal frequencies give a measure of the time scale for the relaxation , which is difficult to compute directly .",
    "this provides the motivation to study the quasi normal modes of various fields in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "earlier work the quasi normal modes of schwarzschild - ads black holes @xcite have proved that the modes scale with the temperature of the event horizon .",
    "+ complete quantization of gravity is one of the major goals of modern theoretical physics . despite decades of research by physicists all over the world",
    ", it is yet to be achieved with complete success .",
    "one often takes clues from the classical theory of a system when attempting its quantization and gravity needs to be no different .",
    "quantization of the black hole horizon area is expected to be a major feature of any successful quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the original `` classical '' theory of gravity , namely the general theory of relativity ( gtr ) does provide us with the tools necessary to estimate the value of the area quantum .",
    "it is known from field theory that the presence of a periodicity in the classical theory of a system points to the existence of an adiabatic invariant with a discrete spectrum in the corresponding quantum theory .",
    "interestingly , it has been observed in gtr that the numerical value of these frequencies , in the limit of `` large '' frequencies , follow a distinct pattern , with the real part approaching a fixed value .",
    "these are termed asymptotic frequencies .",
    "suggestions have been made that the fixed value of the real part can be viewed as a physically relevant periodicity in the ( classical ) black hole system which would then lead to the existence of certain adiabatic invariant quantity , which in turn would possess equally spaced spectrum according to bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "once we read it together with bekenstein s original proposal @xcite that the black hole entropy is an adiabatic invariant with a discrete , equally spaced spectrum , we come to the conclusion that the entropy spectrum ( and , by extension , the area spectrum ) can be deduced from the asymptotic value of the quasi normal frequencies .",
    "the connection between the fixed asymptotic frequencies and the quantized area spectrum was made by hod @xcite .",
    "dreyer @xcite recovered hod s result in the loop quantum gravity .",
    "a new interpretation for the quasi normal modes @xmath2 of perturbed black holes as equivalent to that of a collection of damped harmonic oscillators with real frequency @xmath3 was introduced by maggiore @xcite and used in conjunction with hod s method in order to compute the area spectrum of schwarzschild black holes .",
    "+ as with the case of quasi normal modes , it is the ads / cft correspondence that provides the motivation for studying the area spectrum of black holes in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "recent studies ( @xcite and references therein ) suggest that the gravitational dual of the holographic entanglement entropy in quantum field theories is the area of minimal - area surfaces in ads spaces .",
    "the entropy can be used to study phase transitions between various states of the field .",
    "an area - entanglement entropy relation of the form @xmath4 has been proposed @xcite which is very similar to the familiar area - entropy relation in the general theory of relativity . here , @xmath5 is the @xmath0-dimensional minimal area surface in @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the @xmath8-dimensional gravitational constant of the ads gravity .",
    "although the above relation was originally proposed for ads spaces , it is equally applicable to any asymptotically ads space , including one containing a black hole . in that case",
    ", the minimal surface tends to wrap the horizon and thus we can use the area of the event horizon in order to compute the entanglement entropy in the conformal field theory .",
    "+ in this work , we numerically compute the quasi normal frequencies for massless scalar field perturbations in asymptotically ads , spherically symmetric spacetimes in lovelock model using the metric derived in @xcite .",
    "we analytically find out the asymptotic form of the frequencies following @xcite and use it to deduce the area spectrum of large black holes in the model .",
    "a brief outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ theory ] , we explain the maximally symmetric lovelock model and the resulting metric for the spacetime as given in @xcite .",
    "details of the horowitz - hubeny numerical method of computing the quasi normal frequencies in ads black hole spacetimes to the case of massless scalar fields in the vicinity of such a black hole in the lovelock - ads model are also given in the same section .",
    "the results of the numerical procedure are presented and analyzed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] . in sect .",
    "[ asymp ] , we analytically determine the asymptotic quasi normal frequencies of the field for the case of large back holes following @xcite .",
    "the results of that analysis are used in order to find the area spectrum of the black hole using the kunstatter s method @xcite in sect .",
    "[ area_spectrum ] .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the lovelock model @xcite is considered to be the most natural generalization of gtr . the lovelock lagrangian is a polynomial which consists of dimensionally continued higher order curvature terms .",
    "the most striking property of this lagrangian is that it yields field equations that are in second order in the metric although the lagrangian itself may contain higher order terms . also , the theory is known to give solutions that are free of ghosts .",
    "the maximum order of terms in the action , @xmath9 , is fixed by the number of dimensions of the spacetime @xmath0 in lovelock model according to the relation @xmath10 $ ] where @xmath11 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath12 .",
    "the action is written in terms of the riemann curvature @xmath13 and the vielbein @xmath14 as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are arbitrary ( positive ) coupling constants , and @xmath17 , given by    @xmath18    is the @xmath19 order dimensionally continued term in the lagrangian .",
    "the difficulty with the lagrangian given above , with arbitrary values for @xmath16 , is that it becomes very difficult ( if not impossible ) to study the evolution of fields , since it is not at all clear whether the operator representing the evolution is hermitian or not . as mentioned in the previous section , this problem , for the case of metric perturbations ,",
    "has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "although a general instability depending on the black hole mass has been established in that work , the numerical value for the critical mass has not been calculated .",
    "also , it is very difficult to predict whether the presence of a cosmological constant raises or lowers the critical mass , as long as we consider a model with arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , for the same case , the the existence of negative energy solutions with horizons and positive energy solutions with naked singularities for ( [ llaction ] ) has been pointed out earlier @xcite .",
    "these difficulties bring out the necessity of selecting suitable values for the coupling coefficients in order to have models that support maximally symmetric solutions and external perturbations .",
    "maximally symmetric solutions to lovelock model have long been known @xcite , which are derived by requiring that the theories must possess a unique cosmological constant ( and consequently a unique ads radius @xmath20 ) for all orders .",
    "the resulting set of coupling constants are seen to be labeled by the order @xmath9 and the gravitational constant @xmath21 .",
    "the metric describing the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime is derived from the action given in ( [ llaction ] ) with the choice    @xmath22    where @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the resulting field equations are of the form    @xmath24    here , @xmath25 .",
    "such theories are labeled by @xmath9 and have two fundamental constants , @xmath26 and @xmath20 , related to the gravitational constant @xmath27 and the cosmological constant @xmath28 respectively through the relations    @xmath29    @xmath30 being the volume of the @xmath31 dimensional spherically symmetric tangent space .",
    "the static and spherically symmetric solutions to ( [ ssymmfieldeq ] ) , written in schwarzschild - like coordinates , take the form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is given by    @xmath34    we take",
    "the integration constant @xmath36 is written as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 stands for the mass of the black hole .",
    "the constant @xmath39 is chosen so that the horizon shrinks to a point for @xmath40 , as    @xmath41    it is interesting that the exponent of @xmath42 in ( [ f ] ) is proportional to @xmath43 . since @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath44 in odd dimensions and @xmath45 in even dimensions .",
    "thus the solution in even dimensions resemble the schwarzschild - ads solution .",
    "the @xmath44 cases correspond to chern - simmons theories which have a vacuum that is different from ads @xcite .",
    "their quasi normal modes , mass and area spectra have already been computed @xcite .",
    "what makes it interesting is the fact that recent studies @xcite on the stability of metric perturbations in lovelock model also point out that it is possible to predict the ( in)stability of the perturbations only in even dimensions .",
    "the present work is limited to the cases where @xmath46 .",
    "then we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "consider the scalar field @xmath49 that obeys the klein - gordon equation given by    @xmath50    @xmath51 being the co - ordinates in the spherically symmetric tangent space and @xmath52 being components of the metric tensor .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions of ingoing plane wave solution at the event horizon and vanishing field at the boundary .",
    "the boundary condition at the horizon suggests the ansatz @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the tortoise coordinate defined by    @xmath55    in the @xmath56 system , the metric reads    @xmath57    and we take the ansatz    @xmath58    so that ( [ kgeq ] ) becomes    @xmath59   \\frac{d}{dr } \\psi(r )       - v(r )   \\psi(r ) = 0,\\ ] ]    with the effective potential    @xmath60    here , @xmath61 represents the eigenvalue of the operator on the lhs of ( [ kgeq ] ) acting on the functions @xmath62 in the spherically symmetric tangent space . in order to numerically calculate the quasi normal frequencies for ( [ hubeny_eq_r ] ) , we expand the field @xmath63 as a power series about the horizon and impose the vanishing boundary condition at infinity .",
    "we change the variable from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in order to map the range @xmath66 to a finite range . in terms of @xmath12 , ( [ hubeny_eq_r ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath67    where    @xmath68    and    @xmath69    in the numerical procedure , we find out the coefficients of the expansion of the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 as power series in @xmath72 using a computer with @xmath73 and @xmath74 denoting the coefficient for the @xmath75 term .",
    "then an expansion for @xmath76 of the form    @xmath77    is substituted into ( [ hubeny_eq_x ] ) which yields    @xmath78   a_k,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath79    we fix @xmath80 and numerically calculate the coefficients in ( [ s_t_u_def ] ) and ( [ coeft_an ] ) to different orders and compute the value of the filed @xmath76 as given in ( [ psi_x_ansatz ] ) .",
    "since we wish to impose the boundary condition of vanishing field at infinity , we solve the equation @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "it is observed , by comparison with the values in @xcite , that the quasi normal frequencies are one of the solutions of the equation @xmath81 , solved for @xmath82 , after @xmath83 has been computed using ( [ psi_x_ansatz ] ) for some reasonably high value of @xmath84 , which should be fixed by trial and error .",
    "we assume the same to be true in higher orders as well and look for the value of the quasi normal modes among the set of discrete values of @xmath82 that are obtained .",
    "for each value of @xmath82 obtained , we evaluate the absolute value of the lhs of ( [ hubeny_eq_x ] ) at a point close to the event horizon , since we have assumed plane wave solutions there .",
    "we choose that value of @xmath82 as the quasi normal frequency for which the absolute value comes closest to zero ( the assumption here is that ( [ psi_x_ansatz ] ) is satisfied exactly only for the quasi normal frequency , which we seek , and not by other roots of @xmath85 . ) .",
    "we increase the number of terms to which @xmath76 and the coefficients are calculated until the required precision is attained .",
    "we implement the procedure outlined above after fixing the value of the constants @xmath80 and @xmath20 to @xmath86 .",
    "we investigate the quasi normal frequencies of large @xmath87 and intermediate @xmath88 black holes and set @xmath89 as done in @xcite since we are interested in damped modes . as mentioned before ,",
    "the analysis is limited to the cases where @xmath90 .",
    "the results for the lowest @xmath91 modes of the massless scalar field for first order theories have been summarized in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "table [ tab : table2 ] contains the same for higher orders .",
    "figures [ fig : orlfo ] to [ fig : oiiho ] show the results in detail . as evident from figure [ fig : orlfo ] and figure [",
    "fig : oilfo ] , both @xmath92 and @xmath93 show linear dependence on @xmath94 for the case of large black holes in first order theories .",
    "the linearity seems to be broken when we move to the intermediate - sized black holes , the results for which have been plotted in figure [ fig : orifo ] and figure [ fig : oiifo ] . although the plots for intermediate - sized black holes look linear , the @xmath95 dependence for their case rather resembles an @xmath96 relation .",
    "the temperature of the event horizon for the metric ( [ metric ] ) , given by    @xmath97    where @xmath98 denotes the boltzmann s constant , also depends on @xmath94 in the same manner . since @xmath99 for large @xmath12",
    ", we conclude that both @xmath92 and @xmath93 scale with the temperature for large as well as intermediate - sized black holes for first order theories , in agreement with earlier works @xcite .",
    "another observation is that @xmath93 seems to be independent of dimension @xmath0 in first order theories .",
    "when we consider higher order theories , the numerical results for which have been plotted in figure [ fig : oilho ] and figure [ fig : oiiho ] , we observe that all modes are purely damped ones .",
    "we have only plotted @xmath93 vs @xmath94 in the case of higher order theories for this reason .",
