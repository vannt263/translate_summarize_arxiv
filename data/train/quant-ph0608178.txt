    "optical cavities play an important role for a variety of experiments in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the possibilities of realizing strong coupling between cavity modes and atoms inside the cavities make them of interest for the efficient transfer of quantum states between the radiation field and atoms , as desired in quantum information processing . for describing the coupling of radiation into and out of a cavity ,",
    "quantum stochastic input - output relations  @xcite and quantum field theoretical concepts were developed  @xcite .",
    "a realistic description of the input - output behavior of leaky cavities requires a careful consideration of possible losses that may significantly alter the nonclassical properties of light .",
    "cavity parameters , such as the transmission and loss coefficients , the free spectral range ( fsr ) , the cavity - decay rate @xmath0 , and the @xmath1-factor , have been measured by using the direct transmission of light through the cavity @xcite and by monitoring nonclassical charcteristics of light @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in high-@xmath1 cavities the losses caused by absorption and scattering may be of the same order of magnitude as the wanted outcoupling of the field  @xcite . for describing additional effects of unwanted losses associated with absorption and scattering , attempts have been made to introduce additional input - output ports into the quantum noise theory , see e.g. refs .",
    "it has been shown that even small unwanted losses due to absorption and scattering may substantially diminish nonclassical signatures of the outgoing pulse  @xcite .",
    "hence for any application that requires a precise transfer of quantum states of light into or out of a cavity , a careful description of the properties of the used cavity is indispensable .",
    "recently it has been demonstrated that a complete cavity model , describing all the unwanted losses , requires additional noise terms in both the quantum langevin equation and the input - output relation  @xcite .",
    "this may lead to new effects , such as the superposition of the input field with the outgoing field from the cavity in a common nonmonochromatic mode . in principle , all parameters necessary for the complete description of cavities can be expressed in terms of the radiation and absorption coefficients of the mirrors  @xcite . in practice , however , the parameters used in such a model will also depend on scattering , mirror alignment , and other conditions of the experiment .",
    "hence , an operational procedure for the determination of all the cavity parameters is desired for a correct descriptions of the quantum effects to be expected .    in the present contribution",
    "we propose a method to determine the cavity parameters needed for a complete description of the quantum noise effects of a realistic cavity .",
    "it is based on the reflection of light pulses of different lengths by the cavity .",
    "the absorption and scattering of pulses with a spectrum that is much wider than the cavity decay rate is shown to depend only on the additional term in the input - output relation .",
    "this fact will appear to be useful for the needed measurement procedure .",
    "let us consider the recently proposed model of leaky cavity , which has a partial transmitting mirror , with unwanted noise  @xcite .",
    "the cavity is described by the quantum langevin equation @xmath2\\hat{a}_\\mathrm{cav }   + \\,{\\mathcal{t}}^\\mathrm{(c)}\\hat{b}_\\mathrm{in}\\left(t_1\\right ) + \\hat{c}^{(c)}\\left(t_1\\right),\\ ] ] and the input - output relation @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the annihilation operator of an intracavity mode , @xmath5 is the input - field operator , @xmath6 is the output - field operator , @xmath7 is the resonance frequency of the cavity , and @xmath0 is the cavity decay rate . the complex numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transmission coefficients describing the outcoupling of the internal field and the incoupling of the input field respectively . the complex number @xmath10 is the reflection coefficient at the cavity .",
    "the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are associated with the unwanted losses and obey the commutation relations @xmath13= \\bigl|{\\mathcal{a}}^{(c)}\\bigr|^2\\delta(t_1-t_2 ) , \\\\ \\label{cr2 } & \\bigl[\\hat{c}^{(o)}(t_1),\\hat{c}^{(o)\\dag}(t_2)\\bigr]= \\bigl|{\\mathcal{a}}^{(o)}\\bigr|^2\\delta(t_1-t_2 ) , \\\\ \\label{cr3 } & \\bigl[\\hat{c}^{(c)}(t_1),\\hat{c}^{(o)\\dag}(t_2)\\bigr]= \\bigl|{\\mathcal{a}}^{(c)}\\bigr|\\bigl|{\\mathcal{a}}^{(o)}\\bigr|e^{i\\kappa}\\cos\\zeta\\,\\delta(t_1-t_2 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are related to the transmission and reflection coefficients through the constraints @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 which follow from the requirements of preserving the commutation rules , for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the set of complex coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 completely describe the radiative and the noise properties related to the considered intracavity mode . in view of eqs .",
    "( [ constr1]-[constr3 ] ) , these parameters attain only values within a restricted domain  @xcite . by supposing that the resonance frequency @xmath7 and the fsr are already known , we will formulate an operational procedure for the measurement of the other parameters of this set .",
    "our procedure is based on measuring the reflection efficiencies of different test pulses by the cavity .",
    "we start with combining solution of the quantum langevin equation ( [ qle ] ) and the input - output relation ( [ ior ] ) , also c.f .",

    "( [ etatotal ] ) the total efficiency of the reflection , @xmath54 , can be found to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 this efficiency can be measured , for example , by reflecting the pulse being in a coherent state and comparing the amplitudes before and after reflection .",
    "for the formulation of the first step of the measurement procedure , we consider the special case @xmath57 . in this case , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ outpulse ] ) and ( [ etatotalk ] ) in the limit @xmath58 , the tp does not change its form during reflection ( and partial absorption and scattering ) according to @xmath59 @xmath60 hence , one can conclude that such pulses do not couple with the intracavity field and the efficiency of their reflection is completely defined by the value of @xmath61 .",
    "this efficiency as well as the corresponding phase shift can be measured . according to eq .",
    "( [ constr2 ] ) with such kinds of experiments one can check the strength of the noise term @xmath62 in the input - output relation ( [ ior ] ) . therefore , by reflecting an appropriate pulse by the cavity one can measure the value of @xmath61 and hence of @xmath63 .",
    "the second step of the procedure is the measurement of the two total efficiencies of the reflection @xmath64 and @xmath65 for tp s defined by eq .",
    "( [ testpulse ] ) with two different parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively",
    ". one can consider eq .",
    "( [ etatotalk ] ) for @xmath68 as a system of two algebraic equations for the variables @xmath0 and @xmath69 . resolving it we obtain @xmath70 @xmath71",
    "therefore , this part of the measurement procedure allows one to obtain the values of cavity decay rate @xmath0 and of @xmath69 , eq .",

    "the third step of the procedure is the measurement of the efficiency of the reflection into the caom as given by eq .",

    "the local oscillator field is prepared in the form of the caom with an arbitrary phase , see fig .",

    "it can be performed directly by measuring the efficiency of the quantum state extraction given by eq .",
    "( [ etaext ] ) and the corresponding phase .",
    "this kind of experiment allows one , in principle , to obtain the value of @xmath77 and evaluate @xmath78 using the knowledge of @xmath79 .    as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ constr2 ] ) and ( [ constr3 ] ) , the difference between the absolute values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is caused by deviation of @xmath80 from @xmath81 . according to eqs .",

    "leaky optical cavities with unwanted noise are characterized by several parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated that they are uniquely related to the efficiencies and phase shifts of the reflection of different light pulses .",
    "the proposed procedure of measuring the cavity parameters is based on the determination of these efficiencies .",
    "this can be done by comparing the coherent amplitudes of the incident and reflected light fields . among others",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the specific noise term in the input - output relation can be measured through the reflection of a pulse , whose spectrum is much wider than the cavity - decay rate but narrower than the free spectral range .",
