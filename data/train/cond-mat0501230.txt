    "non - linearity is ubiquitously present in nature , e.g. , fluid turbulence@xcite , extinction / survival of species in ecological systems@xcite , finance@xcite , the rings of saturn@xcite , and others .",
    "consistently , the study of low - dimensional non - linear maps plays a significant role for a better understanding of complex problems , like the ones just stated . in a classical context ,",
    "a main characterisation of the dynamical state of a non - linear system consists in the analysis of its sensitivity to initial conditions . from this standpoint ,",
    "the concept of chaos emerged as tantamount of strong sensitivity to initial conditions@xcite .",
    "in other words , a system is said to be chaotic if the distance between two close initial points increases _ exponentially _ in time .",
    "the appropriate theoretical frame to study chaotic and regular behaviour of non - linear dynamical systems is , since long , well established .",
    "it is not so for the region in between , _ edge of chaos _ , which has only recently started to be appropriately characterised , by means of the so - called nonextensive statistical mechanical concepts @xcite .",
    "in this article we study the sensitivity to initial conditions at this intermediate region for the classical kicked top map and its dependence on the perturbation parameter @xmath5 . the sensitivity to initial conditions",
    "is defined through @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the difference , at time @xmath11 , between two trajectories in phase space .",
    "when the system is in a chaotic state , @xmath12 increases , as stated previously , through an exponential law , i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the maximum lyapunov exponent ( the underscript @xmath15 will become transparent right a - head ) .",
    "equation ( [ sens2 ] ) can also be regarded as the solution of the differential equation , @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to this , the exponential form has a special relation with the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , the optimization of @xmath18 under a fixed mean value of some variable @xmath19 yields @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the corresponding lagrange parameter .    excepting for some pioneering work@xcite , during many years the references to the sensitivity at the edge of chaos were restricted to mentioning that it corresponds to @xmath22 , with trajectories diverging as a power law of time@xcite . with the emergence of nonextensive statistical mechanics@xcite ,",
    "a new interest on that subject has appeared , and it has been possible to show details , first numerically @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and then analytically ( for one - dimensional dissipative unimodal maps)@xcite .",
    "albeit @xmath14 vanishes , it is possible to express the divergence between trajectories with a form which conveniently generalizes the exponential function , namely the @xmath3-exponential form @xmath23 where @xmath24 ^{1/\\left ( 1-q\\right ) } \\ ; ( \\exp _ { 1}\\,x = e^{x})$ ] , and @xmath25 represents the generalised lyapunov coefficient ( the subscript @xmath26 stands for _ sensitivity_)@xcite . equation ( [ q - sens1 ] ) can be looked as the solution of @xmath27 .",
    "analogously to strong chaos ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) , if we optimize the entropy @xcite @xmath29 under the same type of constraint as before , we obtain @xmath30 , where @xmath31 generalizes @xmath32 .",
    "the classical kicked top corresponds to a map on the unit sphere @xmath33 , corresponding to the following application @xmath34 where @xmath5 denotes the _ kick strength_. it is straighforward to verify that the determinant of the jacobian matrix of ( 3 ) equals one , meaning that this map is _",
    "conservative_. it is therefore quite analogous to hamiltonian conservative systems , the phase space of which consists of a mixing of regular ( the famous _ _ kam - tori__@xcite ) and chaotic regions characterised , respectively , by a linear ( @xmath35 ) and exponential ( @xmath36 ) time evolution of @xmath12 @xcite .",
