    "in recent years a clear connection between the radio and x - ray emission from galactic black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries has been established ( e.g. harmon et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; fender et al . 1999 ; mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ; klein - wolt et al .",
    "2002 ; corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ; fender 2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "this connection is interpreted as reflecting the coupled processes of accretion and ejection in these systems , and analogous behaviour may be observed from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei on longer timescales ( marscher et al .",
    "2002 ; merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2003 ; maccarone , gallo & fender 2003 ) , highlighting the importance of such studies .    specifically , in",
    "the ` low / hard ' x - ray state , characterised by an x - ray spectrum peaking at @xmath0 kev , little accretion disc emission and strong variability ( e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) , there seems to be always a steady radio jet ( fender 2001 ) .",
    "this jet is characterised by a ` flat ' or ` inverted ' ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 respectively , where the spectral index @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 ) radio spectrum , and the ( ghz ) radio luminosity seems to be correlated with the x - ray luminosity as @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( corbel et al . 2003 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "the radio spectrum is further observed to extend smoothly through the millimetre bands to the near infrared based upon which it has been suggested that the emission in these bands can also be dominated by synchrotron emission from jets in the low / hard state .",
    "( fender 2001 , 2004 ; fender et al . 2001 ; corbel & fender 2003 ; chaty et al .",
    "2003 ) when sources transit to disc - dominated ` high / soft ' or ` intermediate ' states at higher bolometric luminosities ( homan et al . 2001",
    "; mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) the radio emission is strongly suppressed or ` quenched ' ( tanabaum et al .",
    "1972 ; fender et al . 1999 ; corbel et al . 2001",
    "; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "the millimetre properties of x - ray binaries have been well studied only for the brightest of sources ( e.g. baars et al .",
    "1986 ; paredes et al .",
    "these sources tend to be semi - continuously flaring and the association of the millimetre emission with x - ray state is hard to determine , although millimetre oscillations are clearly associated with rapid quasi - periodic accretion state changes in grs 1915 + 105 ( fender & pooley 2000 ) .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the radio spectrum of cygnus x-1 extended smoothly with a very flat spectrum ( @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ) into the mm band .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented observations of the transient bhc xte j1118 + 480 in which a rather steeply inverted radio spectrum ( @xmath9 ) connected smoothly to detections in the mm band . furthermore , once this source had faded the mm emission had also clearly declined , strengthening the inferred connection with the jet component .",
    "this behaviour was consistent with the correlated radio : x - ray behaviour observed in this state . in this paper",
    "we report the first evidence for the quenching of millimetre emission from a black hole binary , cygnus x-1 , when it enters a softer x - ray state .",
    "the analysis in this paper uses published millimetre fluxes for cygnus x-1 ( fender et al .",
    "2000 ) and xte j1118 + 480 ( fender et al .",
    "2001 ) , plus a new observation .",
    "this was performed on 2002 april 27 16:0018:00 ut ( mjd 52391 ) with scuba ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the jcmt , operating at 350 ghz , and failed to detect cygnus x-1 with a @xmath8 upper limit of 7.5 mjy .",
    "note that although the observations of cyg x-1 range from 89  350 ghz we compare them as if the spectrum was perfectly flat ( @xmath10 ) , based upon fender et al .",
    "this means that for mjd 50964 we have averaged the 146 and 221 ghz measurements . while the radio  millimetre spectrum of xte j1118 + 480 ( fender et al .",
    "2001 and see below ) indicates that assuming a flat spectrum is not always appropriate , we believe that for the study undertaken here it is a reasonable enough approximation .",
    "we compare our millimetre measurements with contemporaneous x - ray and radio monitoring of cygnus x-1 . for x - rays",
    "we have used the publicly available rossixte all - sky - monitor ( rxte asm ; levine et al .",
    "1996 ) data for cygnus x-1 .",
    "these data measure the flux from the source in the interval 1.512 kev .",
    "for all of the epochs except mjd 50945 we have used the average of the individual rxte asm dwell measurements over an interval of @xmath11 days from the time of the millimetre observation . around mjd 50945",
    "the rxte asm sampling is very sparse and we have used the average count rate over five days centred on our millimetre observation .",
    "inspection of the radio and x - ray light curves on longer timescales around the times of our mm observations gives us no reason to doubt that our interpretation of the state behaviour as presented here is correct .",
    "for the radio monitoring we have used 15 ghz radio flux densities obtained at the ryle telescope . more information on the radio monitoring of x - ray binaries with the ryle telescope may be found in pooley & fender ( 1997 ) ; the quenching of the radio emission in soft x - ray states is presented in gallo , fender & pooley ( 2003 ) .",
    "the measurements in all three bands are summarised in table 1 .    .",
    "millimetre and x - ray observations of cygnus x-1 .",
    "apart from the most recent , details of the millimetre observations can be found in fender et al .",
    "the millimetre observations were obtained at a variety of frequencies with the jcmt , the radio data were all obtained at 15 ghz with the ryle telescope , and the x - ray fluxes are in 1.512 kev count rates obtained with the rossi xte all - sky monitor .",
    "these data , plus x - ray hardness ratios , are plotted in fig 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mmmeasurements ]    in fig 1 we plot the millimetre , radio and x - ray hardness ratio hr1 as a function of x - ray count rate .",
    "the hr1 is also from the rossi xte monitoring data and is the ratio of counts in the energy range 35 kev to that in the range 1.53 kev . in the ` low",
    "/ hard ' state the mm and x - ray points are clearly correlated , although the errors are large .",
    "quantitatively , excluding the measurement in the softer state ( see below ) the best power - law fit to the millimetre - x - ray correlation is of the form @xmath12 , steeper at the @xmath13 level than the @xmath14 found for the low / hard state ( gallo et al . 2003 ) . above 3035 rxte",
    "asm ct / sec the source transits from the ` low / hard ' to a softer ` intermediate ' x - ray state ( belloni et al . 1996 ; miller et al .",
    "2002 ) , clearly revealed by a drop in hr1 .",
    "the well - established suppression ( ` quenching ' ) of the radio emission in the softer x - ray state is evident , and the same effect appears to be apparent for the mm emission .",
    "the quenched millimetre point lies @xmath15 below the best - fit relation for the low / hard state given above .",
    "as a caveat we note that variability of synchrotron emission from x - ray binaries does tend to increase in amplitude at higher frequencies , and we may just have been observing a dip in the flux unrelated to the x - ray state of the source .",
    "however , given that the behaviour fits the pattern observed for the radio emission , we consider this to be unlikely .",
    "note furthermore that the quenched millimetre measurement is at the highest frequency ( 350 ghz ) which , were the spectrum inverted as in xte j1118 + 480 ( see below ) , at the time of our observations , this only strengthens the quenching effect .",
    "we conclude that these data reveal for the first time the suppression of mm emission in soft x - ray states , and that this demonstrates the association of the mm emission with the jet component .",
    "cygnus x-1 was already known to have a ` very flat ' ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) spectrum from the radio ( 2 ghz ) through mm ( 350 ghz ) bands while in the low / hard x - ray state ( fender et al .",
    "this was naturally interpreted as a high - frequency extension of the self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum from a steady jet of the kind envisaged by blandford & konigl ( 1979 ) , hjellming & johnston ( 1988 ) , falcke & biermann ( 1996 ) , and others .",
    "direct evidence for the extension of the synchrotron spectrum to the near - infrared has also been found in the low / hard state black hole binary gx 339 - 4 ( corbel & fender 2002 ) .",
    "however , these conclusions are heavily based upon interpretations of broad - band spectra .    in this paper",
    "we have reported the quenching of this mm emission when cygnus x-1 changed to a softer ( high / soft or intermediate ) x - ray state , precisely as has been seen for this and other black hole x - ray binaries in the radio band ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ; corbel et al .",
    "2001 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . it was already known in the case of the black hole transient xte j1118 + 480 that the mm emission dropped significantly as the source faded ( fender et al .",
    "2001 ) . in fig 2 we present the x - ray and mm data for cyg x-1 and xte j1118 + 480 , superimposed upon the x - ray : radio diagram for all low / hard state galactic black hole binaries from gallo et al .",
    "the points for cyg x-1 lie exactly in the same ` cloud ' of points as the radio emission , due to the very flat radio  mm spectrum .",
    "the points for xte j1118 + 480 are significantly above the relation , due to the strongly inverted ( @xmath9 ) radio  mm spectrum observed from this source , as a result of which the flux density at 350 ghz is @xmath18 times that at 5 ghz .",
    "this indicates that , while the @xmath19 relation seems to hold without serious consideration of the source spectrum , spectral effects will be important in investigating the correlation in other bands .    the combination of the data for cyg x-1 and that of xte j1118 + 480 clearly indicates that    * in the low / hard state , the mm emission correlates with the x - ray flux * in softer states , the mm emission is quenched     this behaviour is exactly as observed for the relation between radio and x - ray emission .",
    "note that while it is clearly easier to demonstrate trends in the disc - jet coupling by means of radio and x - ray monitoring ( e.g. gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) , it is of utmost importance to establish as convincingly as possible the full spectral extent of the jet component . only by firmly establishing the contribution of jets to the broadband spectrum of x - ray binaries",
    "can we accurately estimate their contribution to the overall energetics of the system ( e.g. fender 2001 ) . in this respect ,",
    "our mm observations are important as they lie much closer to the spectral regime in which other processes may contribute .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission from stellar winds ( e.g. wright & barlow 1975 ; panagia & felli 1975 ) and self - absorbed ( cyclo-)synchrotron emission from advection - dominated accretion flows ( e.g. mahadevan 1997 ; narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) are associated with spectral indices @xmath20 and may therefore be invoked to explain the mm emission much more readily than the radio .",
    "the coupling revealed here argues however that in black hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state the jet dominates the emission in the mm band .",
    "we therefore conclude that the mm emission arises from the same physical component as the radio emission , most likely to be a jet - like outflow . at such high frequencies we are probing @xmath0 times closer to the base of the jet than in the radio band .",
    "the next step will be to see if infrared emission , probing another 100 - 1000 times closer , shows the same coupling to x - ray states . in this direction",
    "we suggest that the 10@xmath21 m band , where new detectors are now available , and the thermal emission from companion stars and accretion discs should generally be weak .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the use of the quick - look x - ray data provided by the asm/_rxte _ team .",
    "we thank the staff at mrao for maintenance and operation of the ryle telescope , which is supported by the pparc .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom , the netherlands organisation for scientific research , and the national research council of canada ."
