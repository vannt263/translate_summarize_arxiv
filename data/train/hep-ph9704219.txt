    "-1 cm    quark flavor is not conserved in nature , as manifestly demonstrated by oscillation in the @xmath4@xmath5 system .",
    "there is no evidence to date , however , for the analogous lepton flavor violation .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath6 , for example , is less than @xmath7 at the @xmath8 confidence level@xcite .",
    "this is well in accord with the standard model , where lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is expected to be highly suppressed , due to the smallness of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the largest neutrino mass and @xmath11 the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "lepton flavor violation is also suppressed in exactly supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ; supersymmetry , however , is necessarily broken , and soft symmetry breaking terms can in general generate significant lfv@xcite .",
    "recently , krashnikov@xcite and arkani - hamed@xcite _ et al . _ showed that the resultant mixing between at least two of the charged slepton generations could produce dramatic lepton flavor violating signals at lepii or the next linear collider ( nlc ) . while detailing the particular case of two generation mixing",
    ", these authors also noted the obvious extension to mixing amongst all three generations .    beyond simply complicating the analysis of lepton flavor violation , moving to three generation mixing",
    "also gives rise to a new source of cp violation ( cpv ) ; namely , the single complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix that relates the electroweak flavor basis to the three mass eigenstates . in this paper",
    "we examine the consequences of this cp violating phase@xcite .",
    "the analysis is similar in spirit to cpv from three family neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "we shall provide compact formulas for the cpv transition probability asymmetry @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denote the sleptons @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the respective anti - particles .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we show that the cpv result is identical for the available choices @xmath16 and @xmath17  , then consider observation of the asymmetry at future colliders .",
    "-1 cm    first , we shall assume ( as did refs .",
    "@xcite ) ( 1 ) the presence of lfv soft symmetry breaking terms in the electroweak scale lagrangian , without regard for the nature of their origin , and ( 2 ) that left - right slepton mixing is small .",
    "the second assumption simplifies analysis of cpv and lpv effects , which then have separate contributions from the left and right - handed sleptons .",
    "this assumption is not strongly model - dependent , since left - right slepton mixing is generally suppressed by the ratio of the lepton mass to the left - right slepton mass splitting , with the latter set by the @xmath18-term to be of order the electroweak scale@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we shall see below that cpv effects involving left - right mixing are further suppressed by the the ratio of the slepton width to the left - right mass splitting .",
    "we shall thus follow refs .",
    "@xcite and focus on the right - handed sleptons , while noting that generalization of our analysis to the separate left - handed slepton contribution to cpv is also possible .",
    "due to mixing , the flavor states ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) do not evolve in time with a trivial phase .",
    "we define the mixing amplitudes @xmath22 , where the flavor state is expressed by superposition of mass eigenstates @xmath23 of masses @xmath24 , @xmath25 the matrix @xmath26 can be explicitly written using the standard km parameterization with three mixing angles @xmath27 and one phase @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the lsp is a neutralino @xmath32 ( which we assume to be primarily bino ) , the flavor eigenstate @xmath33 can be tagged by the decay @xmath34 .",
    "the flavor state @xmath35 @xmath36 or @xmath37 of a slepton produced at @xmath38 in the rest frame , could be resolved as @xmath39 at a later time @xmath40 with the transition amplitude , @xmath41 for simplicity we assume this to be the only open decay channel ; if not , results below should be multiplied by the decay branching ratios@xcite .",
    "we also take all states to have a common decay width @xmath42 and @xmath43 further restrictions on @xmath44 are discussed below .",
    "the time - dependent oscillation probability is @xmath45 ; note that we omit the decay product neutralino in our notation . the time ",
    "averaged probability that is actually measured is given by @xmath46 @xmath47 from the unitarity of @xmath22 and the second line of the equation above , it can be seen that lepton flavor violation vanishes@xcite as @xmath48 ; in the limit of exactly degenerate sleptons , the mass basis can be arbitrarily rotated to bring @xmath22 into diagonal form .",
    "cp violation is reflected in asymmetry between the transition probabilities of cp  conju - gate channels , @xmath49 . since @xmath50 from cpt invariance , the difference flips sign under interchange of @xmath51 and @xmath52 and vanishes for the diagonal case @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the antisymmetric symbol @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "we summarize all properties of asymmetry , @xmath56 where @xmath57 from eq.([eq : condition ] ) , this asymmetry result could also have been obtained by using the narrow width approximation .",
    "note that @xmath58 vanishes not just for @xmath59 as discussed above , but also if @xmath60 , since in this limit @xmath61 vanishes as well .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that cp violation requires interference between @xmath22 and the final state decay phases in in eq.([eq : transition ] ) ; in the limit of very large slepton mass splitting , eq.([eq : transition ] ) becomes an incoherent sum over the mass eigenstates . for cp violation from slepton mixing , we thus require @xmath62 .",
    "we can also see that cpv effects involving left - right mixing are indeed suppressed by the the ratio of the slepton width to the left - right mass splitting .",
    "the expression for @xmath58 involves the single universal cpv combination@xcite of mixing amplitudes in the case of three families , @xmath63 the magnitude of this cpv parameter @xmath64 ranges from zero to the maximum value @xmath65 .",
    "ref.@xcite shows that the present experimental bound on @xmath66 puts no significant constraint on the mixing angles , with @xmath67 .",
    "one may wonder how the experimental limit@xcite on the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron constrains the phase in @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that at the one loop level , the edm requires both the left and right handed sleptons to participate in the loop .",
    "each handedness contributes a gim - like suppression factor , @xmath68 for our case ) .",
    "together with a factor @xmath69 from the soft susy - breaking @xmath70 term or the supersymmetric @xmath71 term , which mixes the @xmath72 and @xmath73 components , there is sufficient suppression to expect no significant constraint on the phase ( note that the electron edm _ does _ constrain the phase in the left - right slepton mixing@xcite , as well as putting tight limits on a relative phase between the complex mass of the gauge fermion and the @xmath70 or @xmath71 term@xcite ) .",
    "-1 cm    it is believed that the cleanest environment to search for sleptons is at the proposed next linear @xmath74 collider ( nlc ) at an energy of @xmath75 500 gev to 1.5 tev .",
    "the signature for pair production of sleptons is , assuming the neutralino decay discussed above , a pair of charged leptons plus missing energy . in fig .  1",
    ", we illustrate the cross section for right handed slepton production . at @xmath76 gev",
    ", @xmath77 is almost as large as 1 pb under the assumption that the neutralino exchanged in the @xmath40-channel is purely bino with mass @xmath78 gev ( with an obvious degradation for an admixture of bino ) . ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the backgrounds from @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 to total about 12 pb . through efficient cuts@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite estimates a reduction of the background to about 5 fb for unpolarized beams , with 30% signal acceptance , with further improvement possible with right - handed polarized beams . because the cpv signals considered here are simply asymmetries in the lfv signals of the sort considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall simply rely on these figures to provide an estimate of the sensitivity to cp violation from slepton mixing .",
    "we start with a simple cp - odd observable which ignores the full correlation between the lepton @xmath33 and the anti - lepton @xmath82 . from the sample of dilepton events that pass the cuts",
    ", we consider the cpv asymmetry between muon and anti - muon events , @xmath83 clearly only unequal flavor dilepton ( @xmath84 ) events contribute to this asymmetry .",
    "since @xmath85 only involves a single particle count , it can be expressed directly in terms of the single particle transition probability ( eq.([eq : transition ] ) ) , @xmath86     + \\sigma(\\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\bar \\tau } )      [ p(\\tilde{\\tau}\\rightarrow \\mu)-p(\\tilde{\\bar \\tau}\\rightarrow \\bar\\mu ) ]   \\over     \\sigma(\\tilde{e }    \\tilde{\\bar   e   } )    + \\sigma(\\tilde{\\mu } \\tilde{\\bar \\mu } )    + \\sigma(\\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\bar \\tau } )    } \\ .\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym ] ) , we obtain @xmath87 at the tree level , @xmath88 and @xmath89 come only from the @xmath90-@xmath91 exchange amplitude in the @xmath92 channel , but @xmath93 involves additional neutralino exchange amplitude in the @xmath40-channel . thus @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym_nlc ] ) is generally non - zero .",
    "the fraction @xmath94 can be close to one in the limit that the @xmath40-channel diagram dominates , which will of course be true given sufficiently high collider energy .",
    "1 shows @xmath94 to be 0.75 at @xmath76 gev and @xmath95=150 gev , under the assumption that the exchange gaugino is purely bino with mass @xmath78 gev . with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath96 , around at least @xmath97 events from the slepton pair production",
    "will survive the dedicated cuts@xcite which severely reduce the predictable backgrounds to only about 500 @xmath98 events and about the same number of @xmath99 events .",
    "thus , it is possible to measure the cp asymmetry @xmath85 at the level @xmath100 with 5@xmath101 .",
    "the other flavor asymmetries are @xmath102 ( which vanishes because @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 .",
    "statistics will be doubled if we take the combination @xmath105 . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the size of @xmath105 versus @xmath106 for @xmath107 , in the scenario that the mass differences are equal in magnitude to the width , namely , @xmath108 .    in the scenario",
    "where @xmath109 ( e.g. , if the @xmath40-channel gaugino mass is relatively high ) , we can no longer use the uncorrelated asymmetry @xmath110 to probe cpv .",
    "we can , however , turn to other correlated observables such as @xmath111 , which is defined by replacing the numerator in eq.([eq : s ] ) by @xmath112 .    the overall amplitude for tagging @xmath113 at time @xmath40 and @xmath114 after the production comprises two contributions .",
    "one is the @xmath40-channel gaugino exchange amplitude ( for the _ selectron _ production only ) which has the time evolving factor @xmath115 the other is the common @xmath92-channel @xmath90@xmath91 exchange amplitude which has a simpler factor due to unitarity of @xmath26 matrix , @xmath116 \\ .",

    "the amplitudes for @xmath121 consist of a common element @xmath122 from the @xmath92-channel @xmath90@xmath91 exchange and an additional piece @xmath123 for the case @xmath124 from the @xmath40-channel gaugino exchange .",
