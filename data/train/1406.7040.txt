    "the problem of optimal portfolio which is nowadays introduced in a new framework , called _ modern portfolio theory ( mpt ) _ , has been extensively studies in the past decades .",
    "the mpt is one of the most important problems in financial mathematics .",
    "harry markowitz @xcite introduced a new approach to the problem of optimal portfolio so called _ mean - variance _ analysis .",
    "he chose a preferred portfolio by taking into account the following two criteria .",
    "the expected portfolio return and the variance of the portfolio return .",
    "in fact , markowitz preferred one portfolio to another one if it has higher expected return and lower variance .",
    "+ later , we find attempts in the literature to replace variance with well - known risk measures , such as _ value at risk _ and _ expected shortfall_. for instance , embrechts et al.@xcite have shown that replacing mean - variance with any other risk measure having the translation invariant and positively homogeneous properties under elliptical distributions yields to the same optimal solution . basak and shapiro @xcite studied an alternative version of markowitz problem by applying var for controlling the incurred risk in an expected utility maximization framework which allows to maximize the profit of the risk takers .",
    "studying the markowitz model has been done in the same framework by considering the cvar as risk measure .",
    "later , acerbi and simonetti @xcite studied the same problem as the one studied in @xcite with spectral risk measures .",
    "recently , cahuich and hernandez @xcite solved the same problem within the framework of utility maximization using the class of distortion risk measures @xcite .",
    "+ there are both practical and theoretical weaknesses that can be made about the relevant framework of optimal portfolio problem in the literature",
    ". one of such criticisms relates to the asset returns model itself .",
    "in fact , elliptical distribution is the most and relevant distribution which is used to model asset returns in mpt .",
    "one of the reason for choosing this distribution ties with the tractability of this class of distribution .",
    "but , in practice financial returns do not follow an elliptical distribution .",
    "a second objection focuses in the choice of a measure of risk for the portfolio .",
    "unfortunately , one drawback with the previous works , for instance @xcite , is that no explicit formulas are available and numerical approximations are used to solve the optimization problem .",
    "the stochastic models which we are proposing for the asset returns in this paper are based on _",
    "jumps- diffusion _ * ( j - d ) * distributions @xcite .",
    "this family of distributions are more compatible with stylized features of asset returns and also allows for a straight - forward statistical inference from readily available data .",
    "we also tackle the second issue by choosing a suitable ( coherent ) risk measure as our objective function . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use a new coherent risk measure , so - called , _ entropic value at risk(evar ) _",
    "@xcite , in the optimization problem . as this risk measure",
    "is based on laplace transform of asset returns , applying it to the jump - diffusion models yields an explicit formula for the objective function so that the optimization problem can be solved without using numerical approximations .",
    "+ the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide a summary of properties about coherent risk measures and _ entropic value at risk _ measure .",
    "we also continue this section by presenting a typical representation of optimal portfolio problem where we minimize the risk of the portfolio for a given level of portfolio return . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce our two models to fit as asset returns and we apply them into the optimization problem . we also derive some distributional properties for these models and finish section 3 by discussing about the kkt conditions and optimal solutions . in section 4 , we discuss about parameters estimation method which we have used in this paper .",
    "we also provide a numerical example for three different stocks and analyze the efficient frontiers for evar , mean - variance and var for these three stocks . in this paper",
    "we use optimization package in matlab to do the computations .",
    "we are considering @xmath0 as the set of all bounded random variables representing financial positions .",
    "the following definition is taken from @xcite .    .",
    "a function @xmath1 is a coherent risk measure if    @xmath2 for any @xmath3 and @xmath4$].(convexity )    @xmath5 for any @xmath6 and @xmath7.(positive homogeneity )    @xmath8 for any @xmath6 and @xmath9.(translation invariant )    @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12.(decreasing )    in this paper , we propose to use the _ entropic value at risk _ measure ( evar@xmath13 ) which is a coherent risk measure .",
    "following @xcite we now give a first definition .",
    "[ def : evar ] let @xmath14 be a random variable in @xmath15 such that @xmath16<\\infty \\;,\\qquad s > 0\\;.\\ ] ] then the * entropic value at risk * , denoted by evar@xmath13 , is given by @xmath17 - \\ln\\alpha}{s},\\ ] ] for a given level @xmath18 .",
    "the following key result for evar@xmath13 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the risk measure evar@xmath13 from definition [ def : evar ] is a _ coherent _ risk measure .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath19 having laplace transform , its dual representation has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 \\leq - \\ln\\alpha\\}$ ] and @xmath22    for a comprehensive study on this risk measure we may refer to @xcite .",
    "consider a portfolio in a financial market with @xmath23 different assets .",
    "denote the assets returns by the vector @xmath24 in which @xmath25 shows the return of the i - th asset .",
    "the returns are random variables and their mean is denoted by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the the expected return of the i - th asset , @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , assume @xmath29 as a risk measure . then following @xcite    [ general model ]",
    "the _ optimal portfolio problem _ can be written mathematically as follows .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is a given level of return .",
    "applying various risk measures along with different models for random returns yields to interesting problems in both theoretical and practical point of views .",
    "for instance , the classical mean - variance model introduced by markowitz @xcite is a special case of the model introduced in definition @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , markowitz used variance as a risk measure and apply it into the objective function given in and he also considered returns from the portfolio are normally distributed .",
    "[ rem ] it has been shown in @xcite that if we assume the return variables follow elliptical distributions(like multivariate normal distribution ) , then the solution for the markowitz mean - variance problem will be the same as the optimal solution for optimal portfolio problem by minimizing any other risk measure having the translation invariant and positively homogeneous properties for a given level of return .    @xcite has shown in his phd thesis that for two different examples of elliptical distributions(normal and student t ) the portfolio decomposition for expected shortfall and value at risk are the same as the one for standard deviation .",
    "+ referring to remark [ rem ] we see that if the underlying distribution is elliptical , then for any coherent risk measure the optimal solution for the problem in is the same as the optimal solution for the classical model by markowitz .",
    "in this section , we propose two multivariate models which do not follow elliptical distributions .",
    "these models which are based on jump - diffusion distributions can be fitted as the underlying models for returns .",
    "distributional properties of these models will be also studied .",
    "* multivariate model 1 . * consider the following multivariate model :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 are @xmath23-variate vectors such that    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 follows the normal distribution with @xmath37 and @xmath36 s are mutual independent for @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is assumed to follow the multivariate normal distribution with @xmath40 for each @xmath41 where @xmath42 is mean and @xmath43 is covariance matrix .",
    "moreover , @xmath44 s are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "the random variable @xmath45 follows the poisson distribution with intensity @xmath46 and is independent of @xmath44 for each @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath47 are assumed to have poisson distribution with intensity @xmath48 and mutually independent for @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 are assumed to be mutually independent for all k and all @xmath51 and @xmath50 is normal distributed with @xmath52 .",
    "finally , @xmath47 and @xmath53 are mutually independent as well as @xmath54 .",
    "+ this model can be driven from a jump - diffusion model which is the solution for a stochastic differential equation @xcite .",
    "we can rewrite this multivariate model as follows .",
    "@xmath55    * multivariate model 2 . * the model @xmath56 in @xcite prepared the ground to introduce another non - elliptical multivariate model which can be fitted for portfolio returns .",
    "this proposed model is given as follows .",
    "@xmath57 here , @xmath58 are @xmath23-variate vectors such that    @xmath59    where @xmath60 follows the multivariate normal distribution with @xmath61 with covariance matrix @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is assumed to follow the multivariate normal distribution with @xmath40 for each @xmath41 where @xmath42 is mean and @xmath43 is covariance matrix .",

    "the random variable @xmath45 follows the poisson distribution with intensity @xmath64 and is independent of @xmath44 for each @xmath41 . also , @xmath65 are mutually independent",
    ". + like the model introduced in subsection 3.1 we can rewrite the multivariate model as    @xmath66      consider the multivariate models and .",
    "as these models are given in terms of summation of multivariate normal and compound poisson distributions we can provide the joint density functions for each of these models .",
    "@xcite gives the following presentation for the density function of model and also provides a proof but we give a proof here for the sake of completeness .",
    "[ density1 ] consider the model",
    ". then the joint density functions of the vector @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the idea we put forward to prove this proposition is using conditional density function .",
    "since the @xmath36 are mutual independent with normal distribution so the vector @xmath72 follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean @xmath73 and covariance matrix @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the identity matrix of order n. moreover by conditioning on each of @xmath76 and using independency between @xmath77 we obtain @xmath78 for each @xmath79 .",
    "thus , independency between @xmath76 and @xmath77 for all @xmath80 and @xmath81 yields @xmath82 conditioning on the random variable @xmath45 and using the independency between @xmath83 and @xmath45 gives the following conditional distribution .",
    "@xmath84 putting and together and using independency between @xmath85 and @xmath86 provide the conditional distribution of @xmath67 given @xmath87 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath88 gives the conditional density of @xmath67 given @xmath87 . to get the density function of @xmath67 we need to multiply the conditional density by the probability functions associated to each @xmath76 and @xmath45 and add them up .",
    "this completes the proof .    if we follow the same procedure done for proposition [ density1 ] and apply it for the model we can obtain the density function for the vector @xmath67 .    the density function for the model",
    "is @xmath89 where @xmath69 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    in the sequel of this part we provide the laplace exponents for both models and .",
    "consider the multivariate model .",
    "then the laplace exponent for the vector @xmath92 at @xmath93 is @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the column vectors associated to the row vectors @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "the independency between @xmath99 and @xmath100 and using this point that laplace transform for normal and compound poisson distributions exists , yield the result .",
    "consider the multivariate model .",
    "then the laplace exponent for the vector @xmath92 at @xmath93 is    @xmath101    the laplace transform for gaussian distributions and compound poisson distributions exists .",
    "so , can be driven by using the independency between @xmath14 and @xmath100 .",
    "now , we apply evar@xmath102 along with the model proposed in @xmath103 to the optimal portfolio problem @xmath104 .",
    "thus , @xmath104 is written as follows .",
    "@xmath105    applying evar@xmath102 and the model into the optimal portfolio problem @xmath104 yield to    @xmath106      in this section we would like to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of problems @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , we want to examine the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions for these problems and study whether the constrained problems in the last two sections have optimal solutions . being the objective functions for both problems @xmath107 and @xmath108 smooth enough ( they are continuously differentiable functions ) , will help us to verify the kkt conditions much easier .",
    "the kkt conditions provide necessary conditions for a point to be optimal point for a constrained nonlinear optimal problem .",

    "we refer to @xcite for a proof .",
    "thus , the objective function @xmath114 in problem @xmath115 is convex too .",

    "we show that these conditions are also sufficient for a solution to be an optimal one .",

    "in this section we study the optimization problem for multivariate model 1 given in @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , we analyze the efficient frontier for this problem when the risk measures are evar and standard deviation .",
    "our analysis shows that we have different portfolio decomposition corresponding to evar and standard deviation as the underlined model for returns is followed a non - elliptical distribution(model 1 ) .",
