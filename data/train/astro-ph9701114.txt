( 1996b ) discuss the neutron - to - seed ratio and @xmath0 issues related to this epoch , while fuller , qian , & wilson ( 1996 ) and caldwell , fuller & qian ( 1996 ) discuss neutrino flavor mixing schemes which could give lower @xmath0 and hence help the @xmath11-process .    in this paper we perform a complimentary study of the evolution of the electron fraction which concentrates on the effects of nuclear composition changes .",
    "we focus in particular on the early time , low  entropy environment of the shock reheating epoch . in what follows we concentrate on the weak interaction balance essentially in a single outflowing mass element ( i. e. , one - dimensional outflow ) .",

    ". it should be kept in mind that we are not _ predicting _ @xmath0 , as the mayle and wilson results may not be representative of the true picture of supernova evolution .",
    "for example , multidimensional hydrodynamic effects could effectively cause different mass elements to have different time / thermodynamic histories .",
    "nevertheless , we choose the simplest case ( 1d outflow ) to elucidate the physics .    in section [ sec",
    ": over ] , we present an overview of all of the variables which affect the calculation of the electron fraction .",
    "we show explicitly how the various charged current lepton capture processes are important . in section [ sec : nucap ] , we discuss salient aspects of the electron neutrino and antineutrino capture rates on free nucleons .",
    "we explore the difference between using the mayle and wilson transport calculation - derived neutrino energy spectra as an example and approximate blackbody spectra .",
    "we also discuss the effect on the electron fraction of hydrodynamic wave - induced fluctuations in the neutrino energy spectra . in section [ sec : elcap ] , we assess the role of electron and positron capture processes on @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ sec : alpha ] , we examine the alpha effect  or the tendency of the formation of alpha particles to raise the electron fraction .",
    "we discuss the equilibrium and nonequilibrium nature of weak interaction freeze - out in section [ sec : noneq ] , with particular attention to the role of nuclear composition changes and the role of neutrino capture on heavy nuclei .",
    "we give conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the electron fraction , which is defined in equation ( [ eq : defye ] ) , can be written in the following way , @xmath27 here we assume overall plasma charge neutrality , so that the sum in equation ( [ eq : defye2 ] ) runs over all nuclear species @xmath28 with charge @xmath29 , nuclear mass number @xmath30 , mass fraction @xmath31 , and number abundance relative to baryons @xmath32 .",
    "typically , the material is very hot near the surface of the neutron star , where essentially all of the baryons are in free nucleons .",
    "as the material flows away from the neutron star , it cools and alpha particles begin to form . as it flows farther out and cools further , heavier nuclei near the iron peak begin to form . with this rough evolution of abundances with radius and time in mind , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : defye2 ] ) as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass fraction of free protons , and @xmath35 is the mass fraction of alpha particles , and the summation runs over all nuclear species @xmath36 heavier than alpha particles . in the conditions common in neutrino - heated outflow , free  ( not inside nuclei ) neutrons and protons , alpha particles , and a few iron peak nuclei typically account for most of the baryons .",
    "the charged current weak interactions alter the electron fraction by converting neutrons into protons and _ vice versa_. most important in the region above the neutron star are neutrino and antineutrino capture on free nucleons and the associated reverse processes : @xmath37 @xmath38 however , the processes of electron neutrino and antineutrino capture on heavy nuclei can sometimes be important in determining the overall neutron - to - proton balance ( fuller & meyer 1995 ; mclaughlin & fuller 1995 ) : @xmath39 @xmath40 in these expressions , a , z , and n are the total number of nucleons , proton number and neutron number of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "the reverse rates of electron and positron capture on heavy nuclei are generally negligible for the conditions in which these nuclei form .",
    "the ratio of neutrons - to - protons and @xmath0 in neutrino - heated material flowing away from the neutron star is set by a competition between the rates of the processes in equations ( [ eq : freenu ] ) and ( [ eq : freenu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : heavynu ] ) and ( [ eq : heavynu2 ] ) and the overall material expansion rate ( or outflow rate ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that where the rates of these processes are rapid compared to the outflow rate , a characteristic weak steady state or chemical equilibrium  obtains ( qian et al .",
    "1993 ; qian 1993 ) .",
    "the weak freeze - out radius is defined to be where the rate of @xmath41 interconversion as set by the rates of the processes in equations ( [ eq : freenu ] ) , ( [ eq : freenu2 ] ) , ( [ eq : heavynu ] ) and ( [ eq : heavynu2 ] ) falls below the material outflow rate .",
    "though the details are complicated , @xmath0 at small radius is set principally by the processes in equations ( [ eq : freenu ] ) and ( [ eq : freenu2 ] ) ; whereas , at larger radius and at later times , the processes in ( [ eq : heavynu ] ) and ( [ eq : heavynu2 ] ) can also make a contribution .",
    "the rate of change of the electron fraction of an outflowing mass element resulting from weak interactions may be written as follows ( this is a generalization of the treatment in qian et al .",
    "1993 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radial velocity field above the neutron star , and @xmath44 is a time development parameter . in equation ( [ eq : yedot ] ) , the sum on @xmath36 indicates a sum over all heavy nuclei . here",
    "@xmath45 is the mass fraction of free neutrons , while @xmath46 is the appropriate mass fraction of a heavy nucleus with mass number @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be the forward rates of the processes in equations ( [ eq : freenu ] ) and ( [ eq : freenu2 ] ) , respectively . similarly , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the reverse rates of these processes , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the electron neutrino ( positron ) and antineutrino ( electron ) capture rates , respectively , on the nucleus with index h. note that equation ( 8) contains _ all _ the effects which bear on @xmath0 and the neutron - to - proton ratio in a given mass element .",
    "hydrodynamic motion can influence this weak balance via the position of the weak freeze - out radius ( qian et al .",
    "1993 ) which is determined largely by the velocity field @xmath43 ( more properly , in multidimensional hydrodynamic regimes we should write @xmath54 ) .    near the neutron star , before the iron peak nuclei form , the last term in equation ( 8) is zero .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino capture reactions on free nucleons are usually the fastest of the nuclear charged current weak interaction processes .",
    "the exception occurs in the region very close to the neutron star , where electron and positron capture on free nucleons become comparable to the corresponding neutrino capture rates . in the region near the neutron star where the electrons are relativistically",
    "degenerate , @xmath55 can be large and can essentially set @xmath0 to quite low values .",
    "by contrast , at late times and/or large radius , the free nucleons become absorbed into nuclei , and the last term in equation ( [ eq : yedot ] ) becomes larger than or competitive with the other two terms ( in this environment , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are always small compared to @xmath58 and/or @xmath59 ) .",
    "here we include no term which is proportional to @xmath35 , since charged current capture rates on alpha particles are too small to influence the electron fraction in the relevant conditions .    we can give a formal solution to equation ( [ eq : yedot ] ) in the limit where there are free nucleons and alpha particles only , and no heavy nuclei : @xmath60}_i } \\rbrace \\exp{\\left [ -\\large\\int_{t_i}^{t_f }   ( \\lambda_n + \\lambda_p ) dt \\right]}\\ ] ] @xmath61}_f\\ ] ] @xmath62 }       \\exp{\\left[-\\int_{t}^{t_f } ( \\lambda_n + \\lambda_p ) dt^\\prime \\right ] }   dt.\\ ] ]    in this expression the initial conditions are denoted by the subscript @xmath28 and the final conditions are denoted by the subscript @xmath63 .",
    "here , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total neutron and proton destruction rates , respectively , resulting from weak interaction processes .",
    "when the system is in weak equilibrium , the rate of change of the conditions with time or radius in the plasma will be slow compared with the magnitude of the weak rates @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". the first term in equation ( [ eq : soldiff ] ) will be negligible when weak equilibrium obtains",
    ". the second term in this equation will be the value of the electron fraction as the weak equilibrium limit is approached .",
    "the exponential factor in the integrand of the last term is very small except for @xmath44 near @xmath68 .",
    "this factor will not be small for integration intervals , @xmath69 as long as the product of the time derivatives of @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 is small , the last term in equation ( [ eq : soldiff ] ) will also be small .",
    "this condition is usually satisfied where weak equilibrium obtains and where the alpha particle mass fraction is only slowly varying with time .",
    "if the system is not in weak equilibrium , and/or the alpha particle mass fraction is changing significantly with time , then in principle , all of the terms in equation ( [ eq : soldiff ] ) may be necessary for calculating the electron fraction .",
    "if weak equilibrium is established , alpha particles are absent , and the electron and positron capture rates , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are both zero , then the electron fraction will be , @xmath73 this will be a reasonable approximation to the true electron faction at about @xmath74 in the region just below where alpha particles form ( qian et al .",
    "we shall use the quantity @xmath75 as a first estimate of the electron fraction .",
    "we discuss computational estimates of @xmath75 in detail in section [ sec : nucap ] .    although @xmath75 provides a good first estimate of the electron fraction , the electron and positron capture rates on free nucleons can also have some influence .",
    "in fact , at a plasma temperature of @xmath76 , the electron and positron capture rates can make a significant contribution in the determination of the electron fraction .",
    "if the system is in weak equilibrium and alpha particles are absent , then the electron fraction in this regime of high plasma temperature is more accurately given by , @xmath77 = ( 1 + \\lambda_p / \\lambda_n ) ^{-1}.\\ ] ] this can be seen from equation ( [ eq : soldiff ] ) above . at such high plasma temperature ,",
    "@xmath78 usually will be a good approximation for the relevant entropies in the supernova models we consider .",
    "the effect of electron and positron capture on @xmath0 will be discussed in section [ sec : elcap ] .",
    "we generalize this discussion to include the @xmath79 case in section [ sec : alpha ] .",
    "fuller & meyer ( 1995 ) first pointed out that the mass fraction of alpha particles can influence @xmath0 .",
    "this effect can be readily gleaned from equation ( [ eq : soldiff ] ) .",
    "when the alpha mass fraction rises ( plasma temperature @xmath80 0.5 mev ) , free nucleons are typically absorbed into alpha particles .",
    "each alpha particle removes an equal number of free protons ( 2 ) and free neutrons ( 2 ) when it forms .",
    "if the outflowing material in the supernova is neutron - rich before the alpha particle formation , then as the alpha particle mass fraction increases the residual free nucleon gas will tend to be enriched in neutrons . since the charged current capture rates on alpha particles are negligible in this situation , the only interactions that change the electron fraction are lepton captures on free nucleons .",
    "however , since alpha particle formation has left mostly free neutrons , the neutrino and positron capture interactions will have the effect of turning some of these leftover  free neutrons into protons . in turn",
    ", this will cause the total electron fraction to rise .",
    "we follow fuller & meyer ( 1995 ) and call this increase in @xmath0 due to alpha particle formation and weak interactions the alpha effect .",
    "we give a detailed treatment of this effect in section [ sec : alpha ] .",
    "since the material may not be in weak equilibrium at the time of nuclear reaction rate freeze - out and nucleosynthesis , it is necessary to examine the effect on the electron fraction of slow freeze out from weak equilibrium .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : noneq ] , where we present the results of a nonequilibrium calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "the influence on @xmath0 of neutrino captures on heavy nuclei will also be discussed in section [ sec : noneq ] . as is evident from equation ( [ eq : yedot ] ) ,",
    "these processes in principle can impact the final value of the electron fraction .",
    "although it will turn out that the material is no longer in weak equilibrium at the time of formation of iron peak nuclei in the models we consider , the neutrino captures on heavy nuclei ( plasma temperature @xmath80 0.3 mev ) still have some influence on @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we compare the relative magnitude and effects on @xmath0 of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for the calculation of these rates we follow the prescription of fuller & meyer ( 1995 ; 1996 ) and mclaughlin & fuller ( 1995 ; 1996 ) . in computing these rates ,",
    "we first assume a blackbody distribution for the neutrino spectrum , which we normalize by the neutrino luminosity ( see qian & fuller 1995 ) . in figure [",
    "fig : compblack ] we depict a zero chemical potential blackbody neutrino @xmath81 energy spectrum ( curve without circles ) with average neutrino energy and normalizing luminosity taken from the numerical results of the mayle and wilson supernova calculations at @xmath82 . also shown in this figure is the actual neutrino energy spectrum ( circles ) at large radius at @xmath82 as given by the detailed transport calculations of mayle and wilson . of course",
    ", the _ actual _ neutrino energy spectra may differ considerably between different models which employ different transport calculations .",
    "we here use the mayle and wilson results only as an example .    in our calculations of @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "we generally assume that the material is far from the neutron star , so that the distance dependence of the rates is simply @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the distance from the center of the neutron star in units of @xmath85 .",
    "we further assume that the final state electrons are very relativistic , so that the rate may be expressed with fermi integrals . in evaluating the fermi intergals for the antineutrino capture rates , we use the approximation @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the mass of the neutron",
    ", @xmath88 is the mass of the proton , @xmath89 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath90 is the temperature of the antineutrino distribution function ( we assume zero chemical potential ) .",
    "the capture rates are then approximately , @xmath91 @xmath92 in this expression we have approximated the initial and final state lepton kinematics as completely relativistic , and we have neglected final state lepton blocking ( mclaughlin & fuller 1995 )",
    ". the terms @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined in the following way : @xmath95 @xmath96 these estimates demonstrate the dependence of the rates on neutrino ( antineutrino ) luminosity , @xmath97 , the temperature , @xmath98 , and distance from the neutron star center , @xmath84 .",
    "the rates @xmath49 and @xmath48 are approximately proportional to the antineutrino and neutrino temperature , respectively , when these temperatures are large .",
    "however , at lower neutrino and antineutrino temperature they have a more complicated temperature dependence through the terms @xmath93 and @xmath94 and the exponential term in equation ( [ eq : nuapp2 ] ) .",
    "the exponential term in the antineutrino capture rate has its origin in the energy threshold , @xmath99 .",
    "of course , there is not a corresponding term in the neutrino capture rate , since neutrino capture on free neutrons has no energy threshold .",

    "1993 , and qian & fuller 1995 ) . also , at this epoch",
    ", the total energy luminosity of the neutrinos is about 10% smaller than that of the antineutrinos in the mayle and wilson supernova results . in order for the antineutrino capture rate to dominate over the neutrino capture rate",
    ", the antineutrino temperature and luminosity must be sufficiently greater than the corresponding neutrino temperature and luminosity to overcome the effect of the energy threshold .",
    "since the neutrino and antineutrino capture rates have the same dependence on distance from the neutron star , the relative importance of the rates does not change explicitly with radius in this formulation .",
    "the @xmath110 and @xmath111 temperatures and luminosities change with time , and therefore the neutrino and antineutrino capture rates are changing implicitly as the material flows away from the neutron star .",
    "the ratio of our approximate antineutrino capture rate on protons to our approximate neutrino capture rate on neutrons has been plotted as a function of time ( or epoch ) in figure [ fig : ratios1 ] .",
    "the antineutrino capture rate is always larger that the neutrino capture rate in the indicated time interval , and this difference is increasing with time .",
    "the curve in figure [ fig : ratios1 ] has been smoothed into a straight line for illustrative purposes .",
    "variations of this ratio from a strictly increasing function will be discussed further below .    since the ratio @xmath112 is important for the calculation of the electron fraction , it is better to use the numerically computed energy spectrum to calculate the neutrino and antineutrino capture rates .",

    "for the situation we are considering , we are far from the neutrino sphere , and close to the radius @xmath117 of spectral quantity evaluation .",
    "however , it is clear that the effects of neutrino emission , absorption , and scattering must also be included for a precise determination of @xmath75 in the region near the neutron star .",

    "the weak freeze out radius , or distance from the neutron star center at which the characteristic rate of weak interactions becomes smaller than the rate of material outflow in the supernova , occurs sufficiently beyond the gain radius so that electron and positron capture rates on free nucleons have fallen considerably below the corresponding neutrino and antineutrino capture rates . at this distance , and at all points further away from the neutron star , the electron ( positron ) capture rates are always much smaller than the ( anti)neutrino capture rates on free nucleons .",

    "this is a much different situation than the case of neutrinos , since the neutrinos decouple from the plasma very close to the neutron star .",
    "in producing these estimates , we have assumed that the electrons are relativistic , so that the appropriate phase space factors may be reduced to fermi integrals ( fuller , fowler , & newman 1985 ; 1982ab ; 1980 ; fuller 1982 ) .",
    "although the electrons and positrons are not completely relativistic throughout the entire period of interest for nucleosynthesis , their capture rates on free nucleons are only important at fairly high temperatures @xmath140 and relatively small distances from the neutron star . therefore , this approximation is sufficient to demonstrate the general effect of these capture rates on the electron fraction .",

    "clearly , this assumption is only valid when the electrons are not very degenerate .",
    "the region we are studying is far from the neutron star , and at sufficiently high temperature and low density that this approximation is reasonable .",

    "therefore , we use them only to illustrate their influence on the electron fraction . for example ,",
    "convection or other multidimensional effects could necessitate following the lepton capture rates in degenerate conditions which would modify the evaluation of the rates in equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .",

    "the ratio @xmath153 decreases at lower temperature ( larger time ) , due to the increasing importance of the threshold for electron capture , and also because of the increasing ratio of positron number density to electron number density .",

    "<S> our analysis is guided by the mayle & wilson supernova code numerical results for the neutrino energy spectra and density and velocity profiles . </S>"
