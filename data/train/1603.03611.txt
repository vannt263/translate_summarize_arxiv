    "<S> graphene layers are known to stack in two stable configurations , namely aba or abc stacking , with drastically distinct electronic properties . unlike the aba stacking , little has been done to experimentally investigate the electronic properties of abc graphene multilayers . here , we report the first magneto optical study of a large abc domain in a graphene multilayers flake , with abc sequences exceeding 17 graphene sheets . the abc - stacked multilayers can be fingerprinted with a characteristic electronic raman scattering response , which persists even at room temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> tracing the magnetic field evolution of the inter landau level excitations from this domain gives strong evidence to the existence of a dispersionless electronic band near the fermi level , characteristic of such stacking . </S>",
    "<S> our findings present a simple yet powerful approach to probe abc stacking in graphene multilayer flakes , where this highly degenerated band appears as an appealing candidate to host strongly correlated states .    </S>",
    "<S> tailoring the electronic and optical properties of layered materials by controlling the layer orientation or their stacking order is an important possibility offered by the physics of two dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> graphene is the first isolated two dimensional crystal  @xcite and the properties of graphene stacks , from mono- to multi - layers ( n - lg ) , have been intensively investigated in the last decade  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamically stable stacking of multilayer graphene is the bernal stacking , where the a sublattice in one layer comes right below the b sublattice in the other layer  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was not until recently that experiments on rhombohedral stacking , with an abc layer sequence , have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> abc tri - layer graphene , the simplest rhombohedral n - lg , have been successfully isolated and presents a tunable band gap  @xcite as well as chiral quasi - particles as evidenced from their unconventional quantum hall effect  @xcite .    to our knowledge , there are yet no investigations of abc graphene multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly because of the low abundance of this polytype in real samples . </S>",
    "<S> hence , tracing the evolution of the electronic properties of abc - stacked multilayers when increasing the number of layers remains challenging . </S>",
    "<S> one of the intriguing predictions about electronic properties of abc - stacked multilayers is that they are expected to host surface states ( localized mainly on the top and bottom layers ) with a flat dispersion near the corners of the brillouin zone , and bulk states with a band gap . </S>",
    "<S> when increasing the number of abc - stacked layers , the extend of the flat dispersion of the low energy bands increases , while the size of the bulk band gap decreases  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> notably , the surface states of abc - stacked graphene multilayers have been reported as topologically protected , due to the symmetry of this material  @xcite , and may thus resemble those well - known surface states of 3d topological insulators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , due to weak spin - orbit interaction in carbon - based systems , an even closer analogy is found with the surface states of topological crystalline insulators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in contrast to these two families of topological insulators , the bulk band gap of abc - stacked graphene multilayers gradually closes with the increasing number of atomic sheets and bulk rhombohedral graphite may behave as a 3d topologically protected semimetal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the expected high degeneracy of the flat bands could lead to exotic electronic ground states , such as magnetically ordered phases or surface superconductivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental signatures of this flat bands has been recently observed in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) and angular - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) investigations of nanometer scale domains of abc - stacked graphene multilayers ( 5 layers ) grown on 3c - sic  @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate , using raman scattering techniques , that abc - stacked multilayers ( @xmath0 ) can be found within exfoliated n - lg flakes . </S>",
    "<S> they have characteristic signatures in their raman scattering response , which allow for their identification at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures include a change of the 2d band feature line shape  @xcite , together with an additional raman scattering feature which we attribute to electronic raman scattering ( ers ) across the band gap in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> abc - stacked domains can thus be identified by spatially mapping the raman scattering response of different flakes . </S>",
    "<S> experiments performed with an applied magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) reveal two distinct series of electronic inter landau level excitations , involving the low energy surface flat bands , and the bulk gapped states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results are explained in the frame of a tight binding ( tb ) model of the electronic band structure of rhombohedral n - layer thin graphite layers  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the 7 parameters tb model developed by slonczewski - weiss and mcclure  @xcite for bulk graphite can be simplified by only considering the two first intra- and inter- nearest neighbors hopping parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ( figure  [ fig : bs]f - i ) . the calculated low energy band structure of abc n - lg is shown in figure  [ fig : bs]a - c , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 layers . </S>",
    "<S> two characteristic evolutions when increasing the number of abc - stacked layers arise from these calculations : ( _ i _ ) the flat part of the low energy @xmath6 bands ( red bands in figure  [ fig : bs]a - c ) extends over a larger @xmath7-space region , and ( _ ii _ ) the energy separation @xmath8 between the @xmath9 ( green bands in figure [ fig : bs]a - c ) , decreases and ultimately closes for rhombohedral graphite ( see figure  [ fig : bs]d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural way of exploring electronic band structures of solids is to apply a magnetic field in order to induce landau quantization , and to trace the evolution of inter landau level excitations with a magneto - spectroscopy techniques , such as magneto - raman scattering spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution with magnetic field of the four lowest in energy bands of a @xmath10 abc stacked sequence is presented in figure  [ fig : bs]e . </S>",
    "<S> one can note that landau levels are formed from the flat bands ( red lines ) , and that their energies grow nearly linearly with the magnetic field , but starting from a finite onset magnetic field . for @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> the onset field is close to @xmath11  t , as indicated by blue bar in figure  [ fig : bs]e . as a consequence , inter - landau level excitations within the flat bands ( red arrows ) , in the first approximation , </S>",
    "<S> evolve linearly with the applied magnetic field , however with a rather unusual extrapolated negative energy offset ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that this will be the magneto - raman scattering signature of electronic states with such dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> landau levels in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands ( green lines in figure  [ fig : bs]e ) also show a non trivial evolution when increasing the magnetic field . from @xmath14  </S>",
    "<S> ev at the k - point , their energies first decrease ( increase ) with the magnetic field until they reach @xmath15 , respectively . for higher magnetic fields , </S>",
    "<S> their energies increase ( decrease ) with a quasi linear evolution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , inter landau level excitations involving these states ( green arrows ) are expected to first decrease in energy down the gap value , and to grow in a linear way for higher magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> an optical photograph of the investigated flake is presented in figure  [ fig : zero_b]a . </S>",
    "<S> the flake is produced from the mechanical exfoliation of bulk graphite and transferred on a sio@xmath16(90nm)/si substrate patterned with holes in the oxide ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the raman scattering signal from the suspended parts is enhanced due to an optical interference effect in the substrate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the n - lg flake covers five different holes labelled h0 to h4 , where it is suspended . </S>",
    "<S> the flake has been characterized by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) measurements which indicate a thickness of 15 to 17 layers ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering spectra are then measured at room temperature with 50x objective and a @xmath17  nm laser excitation , or at liquid helium temperature in a solenoid using a homemade micro - magneto - raman scattering ( mmrs ) spectroscopy set - up with a @xmath18  nm laser excitation ( see methods ) . in both experiments , </S>",
    "<S> piezo stages are used to move the sample with respect to the laser spot and to spatially map the raman scattering response of the flake , or to investigate specific locations .    </S>",
    "<S> two characteristic raman scattering spectra measured at h0 ( black curve ) and at h4 ( orange curve ) are presented in figure  [ fig : zero_b]b . </S>",
    "<S> one can recognize on these spectra the characteristic phonon response of sp@xmath19 carbon , including the g band feature around @xmath20  @xmath21 , and the 2d band feature observed around @xmath22  @xmath21 when measured with @xmath23  nm excitation . </S>",
    "<S> if the spectrum measured at h0 corresponds to that of thin ab - stacked layers  @xcite , the spectrum measured at h4 is notably different , even though the thicknesses of the layer at these two locations are similar : i ) the g band energy at h4 is blue shifted by @xmath24  @xmath21 with respect to that measured at h0 ( figure  [ fig : zero_b]c , ii ) the 2d band line shape is more complex with two additional contributions indicated by arrows in  [ fig : zero_b]d , and iii ) an additional broad feature ( figure  [ fig : zero_b]e is observed at h4 around 1805  @xmath21 with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath25  @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these are the three main raman scattering signatures of abc - stacked graphene multilayers .        to study the homogeneity of the n - lg flake </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed spatial mappings of the raman scattering response at room temperature , with @xmath26 m spatial steps . </S>",
    "<S> when scanning the surface of the flake , it appears that the broad raman scattering feature is observed in a large domain and that its central position can change from one location to another ( see figure  [ fig : zero_b]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> as will be clarified in the following by the magneto - raman measurements , we interpret this feature as arising from an electronic excitation between two @xmath9 bands of the band structure of abc n - lg . </S>",
    "<S> similar to metallic carbon nanotubes  @xcite and bulk graphite  @xcite , electronic excitations do contribute to the room temperature raman scattering response of abc - stacked n - lg . </S>",
    "<S> the different locations on the flake where this ers signal is observed are presented in the form of a false color spatial map in figure  [ fig : zero_b]h . </S>",
    "<S> the modified line shape of the 2d band is also observed at different locations on our flake , shown in figure  [ fig : zero_b]g . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between these two false color maps is a strong indication that the observation of the ers feature and of the modified 2d band line shape are signatures of the same , abc stacking . </S>",
    "<S> this flake is hence composed of two distinct domains : the first is aba - stacked , and is extending over h0 , h1 and h2 , while the other is abc - stacked , extending over h3 and h4 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of this ers ( i.e. , the bulk band gap in figure  [ fig : bs]a - c depends on the number of abc - stacked layers , and , taking the extreme values of the ers energy from the measured raman spectra all over the abc domain , we estimate the number of abc - stacked graphene layers to vary from @xmath27 to @xmath28 over the whole flake . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is also observed at low temperature , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : b_spec]a .        </S>",
    "<S> characteristic mmrs spectra measured at h4 are presented in figure  [ fig : b_spec]b , for different values of b. the central position of the broad ers feature increases with increasing magnetic field and its intensity seems to vanish for @xmath29  t. the fact that magnetic fields can influence so much the energy and amplitude of this feature is in line with an electronic origin for this excitation . above @xmath30  </S>",
    "<S> t a series of sharp features , dispersing with the magnetic field , appears in the raman scattering response . </S>",
    "<S> they have a symmetric line shape , in contrast to electronic excitations observed in bulk graphite  @xcite .    the evolution of the raman scattering response with magnetic field , measured at h3 and h4 , </S>",
    "<S> are presented in figures  [ fig : b_spec]c - d , respectively , in the form of false color maps of the scattered intensity . </S>",
    "<S> these two locations show a similar response . </S>",
    "<S> the observed electronic excitation spectrum in magnetic field is composed of a series of features linearly dispersing with increasing magnetic field and of the ers observed at @xmath31 , that acquires a fine structure at finite @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the linearly dispersing features , in line with magneto - raman scattering selection rules in graphene  @xcite or in graphite  @xcite , can be attributed to symmetric ( @xmath32 , where n is the landau level index ) inter landau level excitations within the @xmath33 bands and they represent the strongest contribution to the electronic raman scattering spectrum in magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> optical - like excitations ( @xmath34 ) are not directly seen but they effectively couple to the g band . </S>",
    "<S> they give rise to the magneto - phonon resonance and to the associated anti - crossings when they are tuned in resonance with the g band energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such anti - crossings are indicated by red arrows in the b - differentiated color map of h4 , presented in figure  [ fig : b_spec]f . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed analysis of the magneto - phonon resonance in abc n - lg is beyond the scope of this paper . of much weaker intensity , raman scattering features with an energy decreasing when increasing the magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> are observed ( red marked regions in figure  [ fig : b_spec]d - e . </S>",
    "<S> these features are better seen in figure  [ fig : b_spec]e , that shows the @xmath31 subtracted false color map of h3 . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to symmetric ( @xmath32 ) inter landau level excitations within the lowest @xmath35 bands in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of such excitations first decreases with the magnetic field as long as the landau levels are confined in the cone of the corresponding band structure at @xmath31 ( figure  [ fig : bs]c ) and then , when the inter landau level energy spacing reaches the value of the energy gap in the bulk , they merge with the broad ers feature .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of these two families of electronic excitations with increasing magnetic field is grasped by our tight - binding analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we first determined the central positions of the different observed excitations using lorentzian functions , and searched for the parameters entering the model to best describe our data . from this modelling </S>",
    "<S> , we can determine the number of layers to be @xmath36 and @xmath5 for h3 and h4 , respectively ( figures  [ fig : fits]a - b ) , while we set @xmath37  ev and @xmath38  ev , as observed in bulk graphite  @xcite . in a simple approach ( see supplementary information ) , we calculated the electronic excitation spectrum  @xcite and its evolution when applying a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared to the experimental evolution in figures  [ fig : fits]c - d for h4 . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces the main observed features . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the electronic excitation observed at @xmath31 is reproduced and arises indeed from an inter band electronic excitation that loses its spectral weight when the magnetic field is increased , transforming into inter landau level excitations with their characteristic negative energy dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> we report the observation of electronic excitations in n - lg system , which includes a large domain of @xmath39 abc - stacked layers . the analysis of its low energy electronic excitations with magnetic field can be understood in the frame of a tight - binding model with three parameters , the number of abc - stacked layers and the intra- and inter - layer nearest neighbors hopping integrals @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> such stacking has a unique signature in its raman scattering response at @xmath31 , in the form of a low energy electronic excitations across the band gap in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the ers response is also observed at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the central position of the ers is related to the number of abc - stacked layers which can then be deduced using simple raman scattering spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our findings underscore the rich physics hidden in graphene multilayers with abc stacking , namely the existence of electronic bands with a flat dispersion ( diverging density of states ) localized on the surface , and of electronic states in the bulk with an energy gap that depends on the number of layers . </S>",
    "<S> these results represent an impetus for other studies targeting the highly correlated surface states , which may lead to emergent exotic electronic ground states on this system , such as magnetic order or superconductivity .    </S>",
