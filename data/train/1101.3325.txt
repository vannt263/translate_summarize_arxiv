    "the most exciting results in the last decade of gamma  ray burst ( grb ) science at mev ",
    "gev energies came from the combined observations of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse , * ? ? ? * ) with the energetic gamma  ray experiment telescope ( egret , * ? ? ? * ) . both instruments operated between 1991 and 2000 on board the compton gamma  ray observatory ( _ cgro _ ) and covered the energy bands from 20kev to 20mev and from 20mev to 30gev , respectively .",
    "batse observed 2704 bursts @xcite , providing the largest grb database from a single experiment thus far .",
    "out of this sample , only five bursts were detected with egret above 100mev and only one of these , grb  930131 @xcite , had high ",
    "energy emission that was consistent with an extrapolation from its spectrum obtained with batse between 25  kev and 4  mev ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , later analysis of the combined data from the batse / large area detectors ( lads ) and the egret calorimeter , the total absorption shower counter ( tasc ) , uncovered an mev component in grb  941017 described by a power law with photon index approximately @xmath1 up to about 200mev @xcite . @xcite subsequently searched the tasc data for a response to 68 bright batse bursts .",
    "they found that only 21 showed emission detectable by tasc and of these , only three contained spectra with peak energy , @xmath2  @xmath3  2mev .",
    "as these spectra were only found in a time  resolved analysis , @xcite claimed that the high energy component could be hidden in the brightness of the synchrotron emission in a time  integrated spectrum .",
    "they suggested that the existence of the high energy component indicated additional non  thermal processes at the source .    with the successful launch on 2008",
    "june 11 of the _ fermi _  gamma  ray space telescope ( _ fgst _ , hereafter _ fermi _ ) , it is now possible to search and confirm the spectral signatures from grbs up to very high energies . _",
    "fermi _  is an international and multi  agency space observatory that studies the cosmos over an unprecedented broad energy range ( 10kev to 300gev ) .",
    "the gamma ",
    "ray burst monitor ( gbm ) is the secondary instrument onboard _ fermi _ , operating between @xmath48  kev and @xmath440  mev .",
    "the search for higher energy grb emission is carried out with the primary instrument , the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ? * ) , a pair conversion telescope , like egret , operating in the energy range between 20mev and 300gev .",
    "gbm alone provides a much wider energy coverage than any other current grb mission , such as _ swift _  @xcite . as of november 2010 ,",
    "joint high  energy gbm / lat observations have been carried out for 19 grbs above 100mev ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this number represents @xmath43%  of the total number of grbs observed with gbm .",
    "the small number of lat grb detections may be due to instrumental bias .",
    "the combined gbm / lat grb spectra are usually well  described in the mev ",
    "gev range by a single power law with an index in the approximate range of @xmath1 to @xmath5 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this result is in agreement with the distributions of the high  energy power ",
    "law indices observed with batse in the @xmath430  kev@xmath42  mev energy range ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k06 ) .",
    "consequently , photon counts above @xmath41  mev are usually very low , and this , combined with the limited field  of  view ( fov ) of the lat , results in much fewer grbs observed in the multi ",
    "mev band than in the kev  band .",
    "currently , detailed calculations of lat upper limits are being performed for the brightest bursts detected with gbm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we establish a well  defined sample of 52 bright gbm grbs with broad  band spectral coverage and with statistically significant high spectral resolution .",
    "all events were collected during the first year of gbm operations ( july , 14 , 2008  july 15 , 2009 ) and were detected up to mev energies with gbm alone . in section [ sec_instrum ]",
    "we discuss the gbm instrumentation and data types and in section [ sec_samp_selec ] we describe the selection methodology for our sample , mainly based on the peak count rates measured above 500 kev .",
    "in section [ sec_temp ] we present the temporal analysis of our sample over several energy bands . in section [ sec_spec ]",
    "we describe the results of our time  integrated spectral analysis using different photon models to fit each spectrum , and discuss the distributions and correlations of the spectral parameters for the best models .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "the primary role of gbm was to augment the science return from _ fermi _  in the study of grbs by making observations at lower energies ( @xmath48kev to @xmath440mev ) and thus bridging the gap with those of the lat .",
    "the gbm flight hardware comprises a set of 12 thallium ",
    "doped sodium iodide crystals ( nai(tl ) , hereafter nai ) and two bismuth germanate crystals ( bi@xmath6ge@xmath7o@xmath8 , commonly abbreviated as bgo ) .",
    "the individual nai detectors are mounted around the spacecraft in four groups of three .",
    "their arrangement results in an exposure of the whole sky unocculted by the earth in orbit .",
    "the nai detectors are able to detect @xmath9rays in the energy range between @xmath48  kev and @xmath41  mev .",
    "the two bgo detectors are mounted on opposite sides of the _ fermi _  spacecraft . with their energy range between @xmath40.2 and @xmath440  mev",
    ", they provide the overlap in energy with the lat instrument and are crucial in the study of high  energy , hard bursts .    to trigger the gbm flight software ( fsw ) , two or more nai detectors must have a simultaneous statistically significant rate increase above the background rate ( usually @xmath10 ) .",
    "this requirement increases the threshold against statistical fluctuations and suppresses triggering due to non  astrophysical events that appear in only one detector , such as phosphorescence spikes . before performing any spectral analysis , the detector geometry with respect to the grb direction",
    "must be carefully taken into account .",
    "detectors which see the burst at an angle @xmath350 , or which suffer from blockages ( by the solar panels , by the lat or by the spacecraft itself ) were excluded .",
    "sometimes these criteria result in a single nai detector to be chosen for the spectral analysis , which is then fitted together with the mostly illuminated bgo detector .",
    "the best detector combination for each burst is given in columns 4 ( nais ) and 5 ( bgo ) of table  [ tab_prop_all ] .    all three gbm data types , namely cspec , ctime and tte data , were used for the analysis presented in the following sections .",
    "a detailed description of these data types can be found in @xcite .",
    "ctime and cspec data were used in burst ",
    "mode , i.  e.  at 64  ms and 1.024  s temporal resolution , respectively . the bgo peak count  rate analysis and the determination of the burst durations in the integrated bgo energy range",
    "are based on ctime files , which have the finest temporal resolution ( 64  ms ) with modest energy resolution consisting of 8 energy channels . for the determination of the duration dependence on energy",
    ", we used tte data both for the nai and the bgo detectors .",
    "cspec and tte data provide an energy resolution consisting of 128 energy channels and were used for all spectral analyses . the coarse time ",
    "resolution cspec data are normally used as pre  trigger background data for the tte data , since the latter only include @xmath4  30  s before the trigger time .",
    "tte data are then collected up to 300  s post  trigger , and in all cases discussed hereafter cover the whole burst duration . for each grb ,",
    "the data type used for spectral analysis is listed in column 7 of table  [ tab_prop_all ] .",
    "we selected our sample based on two requirements : ( i ) a significant count rate excess above background ( @xmath3  3@xmath11 ) measured by the most illuminated nai detectors in the 50300 kev energy range , to ensure good statistics ; and ( ii ) a significant count rate excess above background measured by the most illuminated bgo detector in the 500  kev1  mev during the main burst emission episode ( t@xmath12 ) .",
    "this combination allows a broadband spectral analysis of gbm data , which spans about three decades in energy ( 10  kev10  mev ) .",
    "it also represents a significant difference from previous selection criteria adopted by k06 , which were mainly based on peak photon flux and fluence values measured in the 50300 kev energy range . criterion ( ii )",
    "was afforded by the good performance of the bgo detectors at those energies ( @xmath3  400  kev ) , where the effective area of the nai detectors rapidly decreases @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss the methodology employed for the burst sample selection .",
    "the first coarser burst selection was based on the analysis of the gbm telemetry packets , which are automatically produced during a trigger and contain all trigger information such as locations , classifications and accumulated rates @xcite .",
    "the so  called gbm `` maximum rates '' observed over a short period after trigger time ( @xmath134  s ) are produced from the accumulations made for the trigger algorithms and are evaluated as statistical significance ( signal over noise ratio ; snr ) versus the background . typically , the fsw background interval ranges from about @xmath14  s to @xmath15  s with respect to the trigger time , thus excluding the most recent few seconds of data and avoiding in most cases the contamination by pre ",
    "trigger data from the burst .",
    "we automatically selected bursts showing an increase of more than 80 counts / s over background in at least one bgo detector over the full bgo energy range ( @xmath4250kev to  @xmath440mev ) .",
    "the refined burst selection was based on the analysis of bgo ctime light curves .",
    "as previously mentioned , ctime data have a 64  ms temporal resolution during burst  mode and spectral resolution of 8 energy channels .",
    "channel edges are controlled using the specific lookup tables ( luts ) , which map the 4096 raw channels into the 8 energy channels @xcite .",
    "exact channel boundaries can vary from detector to detector ( bgo 0 or 1 ) and from burst to burst .",
    "the bgo ctime background was computed including pre and post  trigger time intervals , usually from @xmath16  s to @xmath17  s in case of long bursts and from @xmath18  s to @xmath19  s for short bursts , excluding the interval of the burst itself .",
    "the background  subtracted light curve was then examined for the maximum or `` peak '' count rate on the 64  ms  timescale over each individual ctime energy channel .    the resulting total number of grbs included in this spectral analysis is 52 , which approximately represents @xmath420% of all bursts detected during the first year of gbm operation .",
    "these bursts are listed in table  [ tab_prop_all ] .",
    "the first three columns list the gbm trigger number , the grb name , and the burst trigger time ( in met ) .",
    "the numbers of the nai ( from 0 to 11 ) and bgo ( 0 and 1 ) detectors used for the temporal and spectral analysis are reported in columns 4 and 5 .",
    "column 6 gives the angle ( @xmath20 ) of the burst with respect to the lat boresight .",
    "the lat fov covers those events which are located at @xmath21  65 .",
    "this value represents the initial angle from the source calculated at trigger time and can vary during the burst in the case of a slew of the spacecraft ( the so",
    " called autonomous repoint recommendation or arr ) . the gbm data type and time interval ( with respect to the burst trigger time , @xmath22 ) adopted for the spectral analysis are listed in the last three columns .",
    "the full sample of 52 bursts was further subdivided according to the detection significance of the event peak in a bgo energy channel .",
    "grbs detected with more than 3  @xmath11 significance in the first six bgo energy channels constitute the corresponding _ channel _ sample .",
    "all bursts in the full sample are detected in _",
    "( @xmath4200500 kev ) and _ ch.1 _ ( @xmath45001000 kev ) , 28 bursts are detected in _",
    "( @xmath412 mev ) , 14 bursts are detected in _",
    "( @xmath425 mev ) , and 6 bursts are detected in _ ch.4 _ ( @xmath4510 mev ) .",
    "figure  [ lc_081215 ] shows an example light curve of one of the brightest gbm bursts in our sample , namely the long grb  081215a , which is detected up to @xmath3 5 mev in bgo .",
    "the _ top panel _ shows the 8200 kev band , covered by the most illuminated nai detector(s ) .",
    "the other panels show the bgo light curve in different energy ranges , covering five ctime energy channels ( _ ch.0ch.4 _ ) .",
    "this very bright burst was also marginally detected by the lat .",
    "indeed , @xmath2386 , which means that neither directional nor energy information could be obtained with the standard analysis procedures .",
    "however , @xcite recently presented a new technique to recover the signal from the grb prompt emission between @xmath430mev and 100mev , which differs from the standard lat analysis ( the so  called `` lat low  energy '' technique , or lle ) .",
    "using such non  standard data selection , over 100 events above background are detected within a 0.5s interval in coincidence with the main gbm peak .",
    "the significance of this excess is greater than 8@xmath11 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to correct for the dependence of the bgo effective area on the incidence angle , we calculated an additional scaling factor accounting for the angle between the burst position and the bgo detectors .",
    "this was mainly necessary since the peak count rate analysis was performed on data without taking the instrument response into account . in @xcite , the off ",
    "axis response of the bgo detectors was measured at different energies for both flight module detectors at various angles between 0  ( i.e. , on axis ) and 90 .",
    "a scaling factor could be calculated for each incident direction and then used to correct the peak count rates .",
    "the correction factors are relatively small out to @xmath440  and strongly increase toward 90 . at higher energies ,",
    "the correction factor is not as high as at lower energies .",
    "this mainly reflects the strong absorption of low  energy photons by the bgo photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "an interesting result of the bgo peak count  rate analysis emerges by considering only those bursts , which are located either inside or at the edge of the lat fov .",
    "( i.e. @xmath2165  or 65@xmath24  from the lat boresight , respectively )",
    ". figure [ histo_pcr_lat_boh ] shows the bgo peak count rate measured in _",
    "ch.1 _ for 15 and 11 bursts , which respectively fulfill these conditions .",
    "the gbm trigger ids and numbers for both subsamples are listed on the top right corner of each plot .",
    "circles ( green ) , stars ( orange ) and squares ( red ) represent firm , marginal or no lat detections , respectively .",
    "the dotted line marks a `` detection limit '' , which was arbitrarily placed at 30 ( top panel ) and 100 cps ( bottom panel ) in the _ ch.1 _",
    "peak count rate . for those bursts with lower rates in _",
    "ch.1 _ no detection has been yet reported from the lat .",
    "the very promising @xcite lle technique may recover the signal to confirm the lat marginal detections and even reveal undiscovered emission from some of the figure [ histo_pcr_lat_boh ] bgo bursts lying below these arbitrary thresholds .",
    "the significance of the above analysis lies in its potential to provide a good predictor for lat detections of gbm grbs .",
    "we plan to implement the relevant software into the gbm fsw .",
    "thus , starting from the burst location relative to the lat fov , the code would perform a finer computation of the bgo _",
    "ch.1 _ count rate as measured between 500kev and 1mev .",
    "this information would then be sent to the ground , where it would be rapidly and automatically analyzed , and subsequently ( as the case maybe ) provide a prompt alert of space and ground  based grb observatories .",
    "we used the ctime data of the most illuminated nai detector for each grb to compute the @xmath25  duration @xcite in the batse energy range of 50300kev ( for comparison reasons ) .",
    "the background model was determined by fitting a low  order ( @xmath26  4 ) polynomial function over at least a few hundred seconds before and after the trigger time .",
    "all standard @xmath25  durations in the 50300 kev energy range were computed with the spectral analysis software rmfit ( version 3.8 ) ( see e.  g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was also employed for the spectral analysis presented in",
    " [ sec_spec ] .",
    "the resulting durations were thus estimated in photon space ( i.e. , the time it took to collect 90%  of the burst photons ) . a different approach ( since the bgo data were not yet programmed in rmfit at that time )",
    "was adopted to compute the burst durations in the 300 kev10 mev energy range , where we estimated the @xmath25 s in _ count _ space using software developed at mpe , thus obtaining a measure of the so  called `` bgo  duration '' .",
    "figure  [ plot_t90_distributions ] includes both data sets for demonstration purposes .",
    "although these are not directly comparable ( photon _ versus _ count durations ) they serve as qualitative trend indicators as we discuss below .",
    "the initially selected sample of 52 grbs includes 18 bursts with a duration @xmath25@xmath13 3  s ( 50300kev , _ short grbs _ ) , and 34 bursts with a duration @xmath25@xmath3 3  s ( 50300kev , _ long grbs _ ) .",
    "the three longest bursts in the sample , with durations greater than 100  s , are grb  081009 , grb  090323 and grb  096018 , while the three shortest ones are grb  081226b , grb  090328b and grb  090228 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ plot_t90_distributions ] shows the distribution of @xmath25 , calculated in the 50300kev and in the 300 kev10mev energy ranges , for all 52 bursts .",
    "we note that the duration bimodality found in the batse data @xcite is evident even in this small sample of gbm data and in both count and photon  space durations .",
    "we fitted each distribution with a double gaussian function to estimate the medians and deviations .",
    "we found that short bursts peak at 1.2 @xmath270.3s ( 1.04 @xmath270.16s ) in the 50300kev ( 300kev10mev ) bands , while long bursts peak at 33 @xmath275 s ( 25 @xmath278s ) , respectively . in the bottom panel of figure [ plot_t90_distributions ]",
    "we plot the @xmath25  distributions against each other .",
    "the dashed line represents a linear fit applied to the data , it has a slope of @xmath28 , and lies below the bisector ( continuous line ) , indicating that on the average , the bgo durations are smaller than the nai s .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with the earlier findings of @xcite that grb durations decline with energy . in  [ duration_evolution ] we explore and expand this relationship to the mev range for the first time .",
    "we followed the approach described by @xcite , who presented the analysis of 72 intense grbs from the batse 3b catalog .",
    "they measured their @xmath25  in four broad energy channels , namely 2550kev , 50100kev , 100300kev , and @xmath3300kev .",
    "the bursts used for their study were uniformly selected by their peak photon flux on the 64  ms time scale .",
    "thanks to the broader bgo energy coverage , we can measure @xmath25  over the five additional energy channels described in ",
    "[ sec_samp_selec ] ( the only exception is _ ch.0 _ , which is here defined between 300500kev , to match the upper edge of the batse @xmath25  values , for comparison reasons ) .",
    "the @xmath25  calculated using nai only data in the 50300kev energy band represents our lowest measurement ; this energy interval was not further subdivided .",
    "the energy intervals used for our analysis are listed in the first column of table [ tab_dur_en ] .",
    "columns 24 give the number of bursts detected over the different energy intervals , where t indicates the total number of grbs , and l and s indicate long and short bursts , respectively .",
    "the average @xmath25  values calculated using nai only data in the 50300kev for each subgroup ( again in photon space ) are given in columns 5 and 6 .",
    "it is worth noting that _ the bursts detected up to higher energies are systematically longer_. this behavior is seen for both long and short grbs .",
    "we then fitted the energy _ versus _ duration values for each burst in the sample , excluding the nai data points ( to ensure a homogeneous set ) to a power  law function given by @xmath29 using a @xmath30 minimization technique .",
    "we used the central energy value to represent each energy channel in the fit .",
    "the distribution of the best fit indexes , @xmath31 , over all energy intervals is shown in figure [ histogram_alpha ] .",
    "blue and red shaded histograms represent the distributions of long and short grbs , respectively .",
    "the average value of @xmath31 calculated with this technique is @xmath320.04(0.34 ) , where the first error is the error in the mean , and the error given in parenthesis is the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the result of @xcite and indicates that the same overall trend of declining duration _ versus _ energy in the grb light curves continues up to at least 10mev .",
    "we now proceed to explore the duration ",
    "energy relation in subsamples of our 52 grbs selected according to their highest detection in each of the 5 bgo channels described above .",
    "the sample sizes are defined in table [ tab_dur_en ] ; e.g. , 22 long grbs are detected up to _",
    "ch.1 _ and a mere 4 up to _",
    "ch.5_. for each subsample , we first average the values of @xmath25  for each energy channel , and then fit a power law to these data as we did in the total sample .",
    "these fits were computed separately for long and short bursts and are shown in two panels in figure  [ plot_duration_energy ] .",
    "the values of their @xmath31 are given in columns 7 and 8 of table [ tab_dur_en ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ plot_duration_energy ] clearly exhibits the trend for the longest subsample to extend to higher energies ; we can see the same trend in the short grb subsample albeit with lesser statistical significance .",
    "whether this trend is simply a selection effect or an intrinsic grb property remains to be determined with a larger grb sample , including events with lat detections possibly extending this relation to higher energies .",
    "we find evidence for slight curvature of @xmath25   _ versus _ energy in both duration modes indicating a potential cut off .",
    "the detailed study of these relations using a uniform data set and time  resolved binning of the nai durations is the subject of another publication , currently in preparation @xcite .",
    "we note here that the red subsamples include grbs that have indeed been detected with the lat in gev energies .",

    "the energy fluence distribution for both samples is calculated in the ( batse ) energy range of 252000kev and is also shown in the bottom right panel of figure  [ histo_all_param_batse ] .",
    "it becomes immediately evident that the two samples were selected following different criteria .",
    "the k06 sample comprises more grbs with higher fluence than the gbm sample .",
    "this difference is even more clearly demonstrated in figure  [ plot_epeak_fluence ] , where we plot the gbm burst @xmath25  durations versus their fluences ( top right panel ) and peak fluxes ( calculated over 128ms , bottom right panel ) between 8kev40mev .",
    "a comparison of the two panels shows that a high  fluence criterion would have included by far less short grbs in our sample , as their total energies are much smaller than those of the long events , while their peak fluxes span a broader range . with 18 short grbs out of 52",
    "selected bright bursts ( @xmath430% ) , the first year of gbm sample contains many more bright short and hard bursts than k06 .",
    "in fact , only 17 out of 350 batse bright bursts are short , representing @xmath45%  of the sample .",
    "another reason for the difference between the two samples is likely the improved trigger algorithms implemented in the gbm fsw .",
    "batse had three time ",
    "interval algorithms ( based on one energy interval ) , while gbm currently employs 28 trigger algorithms at various time and energy channel combinations .",
    "these algorithms have vastly improved the capability of the instrument to trigger on short _ and hard _ grbs , compared to batse .",
    "empirical correlations among spectral parameters have been previously found with smaller grb samples either within individual bursts or for collections of time  resolved parameters of multiple events .",
    "k06 found no indication of global correlations among the time ",
    "integrated spectral parameters of their best sample ( discussed in   [ sec_comp_batse ] ) , while they found strong correlations among the time  resolved spectral parameters .",
    "they also noted that it is best to look for parameter correlations within _ individual _ bursts to eliminate possible effects due to cosmological redshift that varies from burst to burst . since no time ",
    "resolved spectral analysis was performed in this work , we limit our correlation analysis to comparisons of the low and high  energy spectral parameters against @xmath2  values and against each other .",
    "figure  [ plot_epeak_beta ] shows the scatter plot of the _ band _ function high  energy index @xmath37 _ versus _",
    "@xmath2  for the gbm data alone ( top panel ) , and for the combined data sets of gbm and batse ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the most distinct differences between the two samples is the larger @xmath2  span of the gbm data , and the larger @xmath37 spread of the batse data .",
    "the reasons for the former have been elaborated in   [ sec_comp_batse ] ; the latter is the effect again of the k06 selection for fluence and not for hardness ( as in the gbm sample ) and constitutes , therefore , a more representative characteristic of the grb population as a whole .",
    "the gbm subsample of the bright , hard events , also includes  not quite unexpectedly  the majority of the lat grbs , and falls well within the batse @xmath37 range .",
    "figure  [ plot_epeak_fluence ] displays the @xmath2  and @xmath25  distributions against energy fluences and peak fluxes measured over the entire gbm energy band , i.e. , 8kev40  mev .",
    "@xmath2  is plotted against fluences for short and long gbm grbs ( red and blue data points , top left panel ) and for gbm and batse bright grbs ( black and grey data points , bottom left panel ) .",
    "short , low ",
    "fluence bursts show higher @xmath2  values , while long , high  fluence bursts tend to have lower @xmath2  values .",
    "the distribution of @xmath25  measured in the standard batse energy range of 50300kev _ versus _ energy fluence in the gbm 8kev40mev band is shown in the top right panel of figure  [ plot_epeak_fluence ] .",
    "this panel clearly exhibits the trend already shown with the _ swift _  data that short bursts have lower fluences than longer ones and that high fluences unambiguously correspond to longer durations @xcite .",
    "the lower right panel exhibits that both long and short grbs have a similar ( broad ) peak flux range .    finally",
    ", we plot in figure  [ plot_t90_hr ] the distribution of hardness ratios _ versus _ @xmath25 .",
    "the hardness ratios are defined by the ratio of counts collected in the bgo energy range over those collected in the nai energy range ( 100040000/81000 , in kev units ) .",
    "although the current sample is not very large , it allows us to distinguish that shorter bursts in general tend to have harder spectra than the long ones .",
    "amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported a relation of @xmath41  _ versus _",
    "@xmath2  using the batse data set .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that their results may have suffered from strong selection effects and were inconsistent with a larger set of grb data obtained with batse .",
    "we tested here the amati relation for those bursts included in the bgo  bright burst sample with a redshift measurement .",
    "we only had 7 cases , namely six long grbs ( grb  080916c , @xmath42 @xcite ; grb  090102 , @xmath43 ; grb  090323 , @xmath44 ; grb  090328 , @xmath45 ; grb  090424 , @xmath46 ; and grb  090618 , @xmath46 ) and one short burst ( grb  090510 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "we note that long bursts nicely follow the @xmath2@xmath41  relation , as was also recently pointed out by @xcite , and the only outlier is the short burst . a recent study by goldstein et al .",
    "( 2011 ) explores the amati relationship in detail using the entire gbm data set .",
    "we have studied here a sample of 52 bright and hard grbs collected during the first year of the gbm operation . we have performed temporal and time  integrated spectral analysis of all these events and studied the distributions and evolution of the derived parameters .",
    "the new spectral capabilities afforded with the gbm bgo detectors have enabled us to produce a predicting filter using gbm data alone of potential grb detections with the lat on _",
    "fermi_. this filter will be implemented in the gbm fsw and alerts will be distributed to the wide scientific community to allow timely multi ",
    "wavelength follow up observations and , thus , broadband spectral energy distribution studies in grbs .",
    "our temporal evolution analysis has , for the first time , extended the duration ",
    "energy relationship ( found earlier in the batse data ) to the mev energy range .",
    "although the lat gev detections seem to be longer in some grbs ( even up to hundreds of seconds , as in the case of grb 090323 and grb 090328 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there seems to be a single power law relation ( of index @xmath0 ) between duration and energy in the kev to mev prompt @xmath48ray emission . whether the gev emission seen with the lat in several of these grbs is related to the prompt or the afterglow emission is still an open question , which requires more data for definite conclusions .",
    "finally , we show that the novel gbm trigger algorithms have improved the collection of short and hard grbs , compared to the batse sample .",
    "we confirm that their spectral parameter distributions are overall similar to those of the k06 sample , and that short grbs are in general harder than longer events .",
    "the small subsample of grbs with known distances in our data , is not sufficient to test the various empirical relations in the literature .",
