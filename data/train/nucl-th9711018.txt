    "imagine that in heavy ion collisions because of two - body collisions thermalisation is obtained .",
    "the compound system expands , reaches a volume larger than normal nuclear volume and finally dissociates .",
    "this dissociation will carry the signatures of a thermalised system at this expanded volume .",
    "this simple picture has been used to describe data obtained in heavy ion collisions many times , sometimes with additional inputs . in the late seventies",
    "it was first used to describe composite production in the bevalac data @xcite . at the bevalac energy",
    "the numbers of composites were small and one was content to calculate cross - sections of light mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "as experimental studies of heavy - ion collisions at lower energy progressed such models could be tested in much greater details .",
    "this prompted many detailed and elaborate calculations .",
    "today large codes exist which will calculate cross - sections of composites .",
    "we mention two review articles @xcite , @xcite which provide relevant details and additional references .",
    "another issue that has attracted a great deal of attention is whether or not heavy ion collisions provide a window of opportunity for studying phase transitiions in nuclei .",
    "mean field calculations @xciteshow that nuclear matter has van der waal gas type behavior and thus in the @xmath0 plane there would be regions of liquid - gas coexistence .",
    "it was conjectured that during disassembly the nucleus could be in the coexistence region @xcite .",
    "much of the interest in studying heavy ion collisions rests on the hope that one may discern signatures of liquid - gas phase transition in the data .",
    "the recently developed lattice gas model for nuclear disassembly addresses both the issues of fragment distributions ( the major achievemnt of standard statistical model alluded above ) and liquid - gas phase transition in a unified picture @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the possibility of a phase transition in a simplified version of the statistical model @xcite . given that the model with its many elaborate features is able to reproduce significant details of data it is still an interesting question to ask : does this have much relevance to a phase transition which is one of the issues considered to be of primary interest in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this was briefly addressed in a recent paper @xcite but we deal with this issue here with more rigour and in far greater detail . using a technique developed in a recent paper @xcite we are able to get exact results for systems as large as 2000 particles or more .",
    "another interesting feature is that we will be able to study  percolative properties \" of the standard statistical model . by this we mean",
    "the  second moment \" and the size of the largest cluster , quantities which are of relevance in a percolation model and the study of which is often very revealing @xcite .",
    "in the simplified model investigated here we can have monomers or composites of @xmath1 nucleons .",
    "the composites have ground state energy @xmath2 .",
    "the first term is the volume energy , with @xmath3 16 mev .",
    "the second term is the surface tension term taken here as in @xcite to be temperature dependent : @xmath4 with @xmath5 18 mev and @xmath6mev . in most of the calculations reported in this paper @xmath7 is temperature dependent .",
    "however we also have done calculations with @xmath8 temperature independent at constant value 18 mev and although values of specific heat , `` boiling temperature '' , etc .",
    "change , no qualitative changes are found . at a finite temperature",
    "the composite can be in the ground or one of its excited states .",
    "excited states of composites are taken into account using the fermi gas model .",
    "the internal energy of a composite at temperature @xmath9 is @xmath10 where the last part comes from the population of excited states of the composite .",
    "the value of @xmath11 in the above expression is taken to be 16 mev .",
    "the intrinsic partition function of a composite of @xmath1 nucleons at temperature @xmath9 is @xmath12\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is assumed that the freeze - out density is small so that at disasembly different composites do not interact with each other ( except through excluded volume effect ) .    in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the average number of composite of @xmath1 nucleons is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 where for @xmath15 is given by eq.(1 ) and @xmath16 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 is fixed from the condition @xmath18 .",
    "although not crucial for the work done in this paper we want to comment on the volume parameter @xmath19 which appears in eqn ( 2.2 ) .",
    "we distinguish here between the volume @xmath20 to which the compound system has expanded and the volume @xmath19 which is the available volume for the composite of @xmath1 nucleons to move around . for thermodynamics it is @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 which is to be used .",
    "the two volumes are related to each other but are not identical .",
    "we assume that composites appear with their normal volume .",
    "thus the volume which a composite of @xmath1 nucleons occupies is @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "it then follows that if the total number of nucleons fragmenting is @xmath23 , the excluded volume @xmath24 is @xmath25 and we take the available volume for thermalisation to be @xmath26 .",
    "we show most of the calculations for @xmath27 .",
    "this means calculations are done with @xmath28 .",
    "we wrote down the average number of particles according to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we will however mostly use the canonical ensemble using a technique developed in @xcite .",
    "the canonical partition function @xmath29 for @xmath23 particles is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of composites which has @xmath1 nucleons and the sum above goes over all the partitions which satisfy @xmath32 .",
    "the probability that a given admissible partition @xmath33 is obtained is given by @xmath34 the partition function @xmath29 can be built by recursion relation . starting with @xmath35 one",
    "can build all higher ones using @xmath36 thus one has @xmath37 and @xmath38 and so on .",
    "the average value of composite number in the canonical ensemble is readily obtained ( this is to be compared with eq.(2.2 ) of the grand canonical ensemble ) .",
    "we have @xmath39 which leads to @xmath40 .",
    "these results apply to any choice of @xmath41 but in this paper we will focus only on the choice of eq.(2.3 ) .",
    "we like to emphasize that here the calculations in the canonical ensemble are done without any monte - carlo sampling to obtain various quantities of interest .    in the canonical ensemble",
    "it is straightforward to isolate the the largest cluster for each  event \" .",
    "calculations in which a  tag \" is kept on the largest cluster proved to be of significance in percolation model analysis of data .",
    "it is possible for us to calculate @xmath42 , the average size of the largest cluster .",
    "this should be scaled by the size of the system thus we compute @xmath43 .",
    "this turns out to be a very interesting quantity even in the statistical model .",
    "campi defined reduced moments as moments in which the largest cluster is excluded .",
    "thus the second moment is @xmath44 . to compute expectation values",
    "in which the largest cluster is fixed we need to compute the partition function of such ensembles .",
    "clearly this partition function is given by all the terms in the partition function which have @xmath45 as the highest @xmath41 in the term .",
    "consider @xmath46 we see that @xmath47 is the partition function for ensembles with fixed maximum cluster size @xmath48 , since the first term collects all terms with @xmath45 or lower , and the second term eliminates those terms which do not have an @xmath45 . from this",
    "we can determine @xmath49 , the probability of obtaining a distribution whose largest cluster is @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "@xmath50 it is now straightforward to compute @xmath42 or the reduced moments .",
    "before we leave this section we like to comment on two of the possible shortcomings of the model .",
    "one is the assumption that different composites at the time of dissociation are on the average far enough that they do not interact with each other .",
    "the only effect that can be easily taken into account is through the excluded volume effect but the simple correction that we have alluded to above is really very approximate and certainly not rigorous .",
    "trying to take interactions between different composites would change all the equations for the partition function .",
    "we can not correct this by simply deciding to take an arbitrarily large freeze - out volume so that interactions between different composites are indeed negligible because the major part of the physics will have been already decided and that may pertain to a smaller volume . in some sense ,",
    "the lattice gas model @xcite does a better job of interactions between different composites .",
    "the other approximation is in the assumption that the internal partition function is given by eq .",
    "that equation uses expressions for excitation energy and entropy per particle which is valid only in the infinite non - interacting nuclear matter limit .",
    "thus there will be pre - factor before the exponential in eq.(2.1 ) which may completely mask the @xmath51 factor in eq.(2.3 ) .",
    "other choices for the @xmath1 dependence have been considered@xcite .",
    "the free energy of a system of @xmath23 particles is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the canonical partition function is directly calculated by the recurrence method of eq.(2.6 ) and thus the free energy is readily available . for a system of 2800 and 1400 particles",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 as a function of temperature .",
    "the figure suggests that there is break in the first derivative in @xmath53 which occurs at about 7.3 mev for 2800 particles and at 7.15 mev for 1400 particles .",
    "this means there is a first order transition here",
    ". there will be a sudden jump in entropy accompanied by an infinite specific heat at the  boiling temperature \" .",
    "of course although 2800 is a large number it is not the thermodynamic limit thus the specific heat would be large but not infinite .",
    "the behavior of the specific heat as the system size grows is shown in fig .",
    "2 . notice the peak becomes progressively high and narrow as the system grows larger .",
    "this huge jump in specific heat at the  boiling point \" is readily understood if we consider the behavior of @xmath43 for various size systems as function of temperature . starting from a value higher than 0.5",
    "it quickly drops to much lower value as the  boiling point \" is traversed .",
    "this drop becomes progressively sharper as the system size grows .",
    "calculations with finite systems ( fig .",
    "3 ) suggest that for infinite sytems @xmath43 will drop from about 0.5 to at least very close to zero at the boiling point .",
    "it is the sudden disappearance of the large blob at the  boiling point \" that is responsible for the specific heat going to infinity .",
    "in a percolation model a power law emerges near the critical point .",
    "the yields @xmath55 of the composites obey @xmath56 . in the lattice gas model",
    "there is a continuous line in @xmath57 plane where such a power law emerges .",
    "although the power law is expected to emerge only in the neighbourhood of percolation point an effective @xmath54 can always be deduced from the data using @xcite @xmath58 we have taken @xmath59 and @xmath60 which is similar to values used in other analyses . in the model pursued here we do not find the emergence of a power law .",
    "this is not just because we are using a finite number of particles .",
    "one sees a much clearer emergence of a power law in the lattice gas model even with smaller particle number than what is considered here .",
    "an example of yields @xmath55 in the model is demonstrated in fig 4 . in spite of a lack of a power law below , at or above the boiling temperature deducing an effective @xmath54 using formula ( 4.1)is useful .",
    "as the temperature changes the value of the effective @xmath54 will go through a minimum as shown in fig.5 .",
    "the minimum value depends upon the freeze - out density @xmath61 used for the calculation . for the case shown in figs . 4 and 5 the value of the @xmath62 was 1.84 but",
    "a lower value is found if a larger value of the freeze - out density is used ; correspondingly a larger value is obtained if a lower freeze - out density is used .",
    "we also recall when a true power law emerges at a critical point the value of @xmath54 is restricted to be between 2 and 3 @xcite .",
    "there is no such restriction here because there is no power law .",
    "we now consider the second moment @xmath63 .",
    "this will go through a maximum as the temperature changes .",
    "the maximum of @xmath63 and the minimum of @xmath64 are very close to each other and they both occur close to the maximum of @xmath65 ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "since experimentally a measurement of @xmath65 is rather hard ( see however @xcite ) it is easier to locate approximately the  boiling point \" by the minimum of @xmath64 or the maximum of @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath63 does not grow with particle number but saturates around 11.6 .",
    "we return to figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "while the figures clearly show evidence of the occurence of a first - order transition and the ever increasing values of the specific heat it is difficult from these figures to determine the value of the boiling point in the infinite matter limit .",
    "this limit is more easily obtained from the grand canonical ensemble and using the knowledge gained from fig.3 that as one crosses the  boiling point \" a large blob of the size @xmath66 suddenly disappears . equations ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) are combined to give @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the infinite limit",
    "the term proportional to @xmath1 in the exponent must disappear at the  boiling point \" .",
    "hence we should have @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",
    "this gives for @xmath72=.07273 the boiling temperature is 8.187 mev . the boiling temperature increases with increasing freeze - out density in this model .",
    "we have taken a basic statistical model for nuclear multifragmentation and have searched and found a first - order phase transition in the model .",
    "this phase transition is quite distinct . here",
    "the @xmath65 goes to infinity at the  boiling point \" and the second moment @xmath63 reaches a maximum which is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is to be contrasted with first order transition in the lattice gas model . in that model",
    "the second moment goes to infinity but @xmath65 merely goes through a discontinuous jump . in",
    "so far as the lattice gas model ( which can be mapped on to an ising model ) is a more standard description of liquid - gas phase transition , this particular model considered here is quite distinct .",
    "one hall mark of this distinctiveness comes from the sudden disappearance of @xmath43 which jumps from about .5 to nearly , if not exactly , zero as the boiling temperature is traversed .",
    "if we identify the large cluster as a liquid then we have to say , looking at fig .",
    "3 , that we can have a mixed phase in which half or more of the total number of particles are in a liquid phase and the rest in gaseous phase ; or , we can have all the particles in a gas phase but we can not , for example , have one - third of the particles in the liquid phase and the rest in the gaseous phase .",
    "one has to remind oneself that interactions in the model are treated in a rather undemocratic fashion .",
    "interactions within particles in a composite are treated ( witness the apperance of binding energy , surface terms and excited states of the composite ) but interactions between composites are treated less stringently .",
    "this would make the model quite unrealistic for high values of freeze - out density but of course the model is designed for low freeze - out densities .",
    "we find it satisfying that the maximum of @xmath63 and the minimum of @xmath64 appear at a temperature close to that of the maximum of @xmath65 .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath65 is hard this means one may still locate approximately the  boiling temperature \" by indirect means .",
    "this remains true in the lattice gas model in spite of rather different character of the phase transition there .",
    "thus this seems to be a characteristic shared by many models .",
