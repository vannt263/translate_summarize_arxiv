    "imaging of the vortex lattice has been made in a home - made low temperature stm / s that is thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator and inserted into the bore of 9 t superconducting magnet .",
    "the experimental set - up , described in detail in ref .",
    "[ _ s1 _ ] , has a linear mechanical positioning system that allows to change the tip s position on top of the sample a distance up to a few mm with a precision in the scale of a few tens of nm .",
    "the fine xyz scanning is made using a conventional piezotube scanner that allows for scanning windows up to @xmath62 @xmath63 at low temperatures .",
    "special effort was made to mechanically decouple the stm head from low frequency vibrations of the building and rotatory pumps used for the cooling of the dilution refrigerator .",
    "the tip is placed over the center of the w - nanodeposit at room temperature using an optical microscope and its position remains the same within a few micrometers after it is cooled down to mk temperatures .    we have improved the mechanical rigidity of the set - up and have been able to make long term measurements over the same scanning window . this enabled us to study the field induced modifications of vortex lattice in the same area of the sample during several weeks .",
    "note that , thanks to the improved stability , we have been able to make the stm images of the vortex lattice showing the largest amount of vortices .",
    "the home - made stm - head and electronics provides a resolution of @xmath64 @xmath65 at 0.1 k , tested in low temperature superconductors such as al [ _ s1 _ ] .",
    "this experimental set - up has been previously used to image the vortex lattice in the w - based nanodeposits and a number of other superconducting materials [ _ s2-s4 _ ] . to image the vortex arrangement at fixed temperature and magnetic field , simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic maps of @xmath66 points",
    "are measured by taking a full iv curve on each position during the stm scanning of the tip .",
    "sts vortex images are obtained by processing the numerical derivative of the iv curves , @xmath67 , and building maps of the spatial changes of the zero - bias normalized conductance @xmath68 .",
    "the superconducting inter - vortex regions are represented as white areas whereas the normal vortex cores , where @xmath68 is practically equal to 1 , as black regions .",
    "the sts vortex images shown in the publication and videos are raw and have not been filtered .",
    "superconducting w - based nanodeposits are grown by sweeping a focused ga@xmath69 ion beam ( fib ) onto a substrate in presence of the metal - organic precursor w(co)@xmath70 .",
    "the ga@xmath69 beam dissociates the molecule of the precursor gas adsorbed on the substrate and gives rise to deposits with lateral size and thickness controlled down to nanometric scale . for the sample studied here ,",
    "the growth process was optimized to reduce the surface corrugation and produce an extra - flat film with a well - defined one dimensional ( 1d ) modulation created by the sweeping fib .",
    "previous stm studies of w - based superconducting thin film were performed in samples with larger surface corrugation [ _ s2_,_s3 _ ] .",
    "the films were grown on top of a au - pd thin layer used to bias the sample and deposited on a si substrate .",
    "the au - pd layer produced a surface corrugation @xmath71 of up to 10% of the total thickness @xmath2 , i.e. of 20 nm .    in order to optimize the deposition method",
    ", we use a si / sio@xmath72 substrate and control the beam intensity to get a random surface corrugation below an  .",
    "we have also worked on the pitch of the ion beam to produce the smallest possible and best controlled corrugation due to the sweeping beam .",
    "we obtain a perfectly 1d corrugation with a near - sinusoidal form having a period @xmath48 of 400 nm and a height @xmath71 of 2 nm .",
    "remaining corrugation is of atomic size . as the si / sio@xmath72 substrate is insulating , we contact the film by depositing two lines that join the film to an au - pd layer deposited previously by thermal evaporation , as shown in the fig .",
    "1b of the manuscript .",
    "homogeneity and composition of the extra - flat nanostructured thin film have been carefully characterized .",
    "high resolution transmission electron microscopy , x - ray microanalysis , and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the deposits are amorphous and that the composition is homogeneous as a function of the depth .",
    "the superconducting density perfectly follows simple s - wave bcs behaviour over the whole surface [ _ s2 _ ] .",
    "_ s1 _ shows a representative curve for the tunneling conductance obtained at 0.1 k and zero magnetic field .",
    "superconducting features are highly homogeneous as a function of the position and give spatial changes below 10% of the value of the conductance at the quasiparticle peaks .",
    ".,width=377 ]      in the w - nanodeposits , the length scale for the vortex bending parallel to the field direction , @xmath73 , is of the order of @xmath74 @xmath75 , which is far above the sample thickness @xmath76 @xmath77 [ _ s3 _ ] .",
    "thus , the vortices do not bend and make up a perfectly two - dimensional lattice .",
    "actually , this occurs in most thin films of extreme type ii superconductors , where the magnetic penetration depth and @xmath73 are most often far above the film thickness ( see for example [ _ s5_,_s6 _ ] ) .",
    "the first step to analyse the vortex lattice images is to determine the coordinates of each vortex in the sts images . to locate the vortex positions , the cores are first identified as regions where the normalized conductance @xmath68 is above 0.9 ( see section _ i _ ) .",
    "then , an algorithm is used to find the centroids of the all the vortices . at the highest fields , where the contrast in the images given by the change of @xmath68 between inside and outside the cores is strongly reduced , we first make a low - pass filtering of the vortex images .",
    "the result is always thoroughly checked and manually corrected when needed .",
    "we estimate that we only obtain a quantifiable error at the highest magnetic fields , where contrast is strongly reduced .",
    "there , we may miss or obtain doubtful positions in less than 1% of the total amount of vortices .",
    "for example , in image at 5.5 t ( fig . 2 in the paper ) , we count 873 vortices and we estimate that our error is below 8 vortices .",
    "delaunay triangulation of vortex positions is calculated using the delaunay function available in the matlab library .",
    "usually , at the edges of the images , delaunay triangulation of the vortex arrangements gives triangles whose vertices do not correspond to vortices being first neighbours . in the delaunay triangulations presented in the publication , these triangles have been removed from the images .",
    "this is relevant because , close to the border , artificial topological defects appear due to the lacking neighbours outside the imaged window . by removing the triangulation at the border ,",
    "we thus improve the calculation of the spatial and angular correlation functions .",
    "translational and orientational correlation functions [ _ s7 _ ] , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are defined from the translational and orientational order parameters , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as [ _ s8 _ ] , @xmath80 where r is the distance of any lattice site to the origin , @xmath81 is the number of vortex pairs separated by a distance r , @xmath82 is the number of the nearest neighbours of the vortex @xmath83 as given by the delaunay triangulation , @xmath84 stands for each of the six main reciprocal lattice vectors and @xmath85 is the angle of the nearest - neighbours bond between vortices i and j with respect to the reference axis . @xmath18 and @xmath19 functions shown in the publication ( fig .",
    "3 ) are calculated using the above expressions from the vortex positions .",
    "the six main reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath86 are determined from the position of the bragg peaks in the fourier transforms of the vortex position maps ( see section _ iv _ ) .",
    "we confirm that the calculated @xmath18 and @xmath19 for a perfect hexagonal lattice are equal to 1 when r coincides with the distance to n - th nearest neighbours ( fig .",

    "for example , in fig.3a of the publication , the first three peaks in correlation functions are located at @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath91 at 0.5 t ( insets in fig .",

    "the perfect hexagonal lattice is then compared to the real vortex arrangements in regions where all the vortices have 6 first neighbours .",

    "<S> theory has predicted the existence of disorder induced phenomena such as anderson localization@xcite and the emergence of novel glass and insulating phases from the competition between interactions and disorder as for example the bose glass@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been shown that disorder breaking the 2d continuous symmetry , such as a one dimensional ( 1d ) modulation , can enhance long range correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , it remains difficult to find well - controlled model systems . </S>",
    "<S> developments in quantum gases have allowed the study of the interplay between interaction and disorder and the observation of a wealth of phenomena including the transition between superfluid and insulating glassy states@xcite . however , there are no experiments exploring the effect of symmetry - breaking disorder . in 2d superconducting vortex lattices , </S>",
    "<S> vortex density and interactions can be varied in presence of quenched disorder by changing the magnetic field . here , we create a 2d vortex lattice at 0.1 k in a superconducting amorphous thin film with a well defined 1d thickness modulation and track the field induced modification in the vortex arrangements using scanning tunneling microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 1d modulation becomes incommensurate to the vortex lattice and drives an order - disorder transition , behaving as a scale - invariant disorder potential . through direct visualization of individual vortices , we show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate orientational and positional correlation functions and critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> we find that they are far above theoretical expectations for scale - invariant disorder @xcite and that , unexpectedly , they follow instead the critical behaviour which describes dislocation unbinding melting@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our data show for the first time that randomness disorders a 2d crystal , and evidence the transformation induced by symmetry breaking disorder in interactions and the critical behaviour of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> *    the competition between order and disorder is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> new insights impact directly the understanding of disorder induced phenomena in many different systems such as crystalline solids@xcite , electronic or magnetic arrangements@xcite , localization in metals and superconductors or vortex lattices in superconductors and condensates @xcite . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> , long wavelength disorder induces deviations in the atomic positions from the perfect lattice with the mean squared displacement diverging logarithmically at large distances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one major consequence is the so - called mermin - wagner - hohenberg ( mwh ) theorem@xcite which states that no true order exists in 2d at any finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> usually , we can distinguish between static quenched disorder and fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in absence of quenched disorder , thermal fluctuations drive the 2d melting transition which is described by bkthny theory through the two - stage proliferation and unbinding of topological defects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quenched disorder , on the other hand , is expected to suppress long range correlations more effectively than temperature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be classified as pinning with identifiable length scales , such as impurities or defects in 2d crystals or as scale - invariant ( random ) disorder as for example in an amorphous film . </S>",

    "<S> scale - invariant disorder produces power law decaying correlations and a transition to a disordered lattice with exponentially falling correlations above a critical disorder strength@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> disorder induced order has been recently proposed when quenched disorder breaks the continuous 2d symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs , for example , by introducing a 1d periodic disorder potential@xcite . within this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> true long range order may be favored by the 1d disorder , breaking mwh theorem . </S>",

    "<S> we modify the coupling strength between the 1d periodic potential and the vortex lattice as well as the intervortex distance @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to go from a locked 2d solid where the lattice is commensurate to the 1d potential ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the observed behaviour follows the microscopic two - step sequence for the proliferation of disorder described by bkthny theory , with critical values for the exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30@xcite .    to investigate the microscopic disorder mechanism , we further analyse the first entrance of disorder in the ordered phase i. deviation in the vortex positions with respect to perfect hexagonal lattice </S>",
    "<S> can be quantified by the relative displacement correlator @xmath31 ( @xmath32^{2}\\rangle/2 $ ] where @xmath33 is the displacement of each vortex at @xmath34 from its position in the perfect lattice @xmath35@xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> we plot the result at 1.5 t ( see si for details in calculations and b(r ) at different fields in phase i ) . in 2d systems , this is the expected behaviour in response to a scale - invariant disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we fit the data using the gaussian approximation @xmath37 ( valid for gaussian disorder potentials ) and translational correlation function @xmath18 ( shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the comparison reveals a very good agreement ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , three independent observations ( local vortex density fluctuations , logarithmic growth of @xmath31 and gaussian distribution of displacements ) show that a random potential drives the transition .        </S>",
    "<S> we next focus on the source of scale - invariant disorder driving the transition . </S>",
    "<S> no thermally or quantum induced fluctuations are available to effectively disorder the vortex lattice here . at 0.1 </S>",

    "<S> our sample is compositionally homogeneous both laterally and across its thickness , and amorphous . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no quenched disorder is expected from compositional or structural changes in our film . thickness variations , which are given here by the 1d modulation , come out as most likely source for quenched disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental property of a scale - invariant potential @xmath39 is that is has long range logarithmic correlations@xcite @xmath40^{2}\\rangle = 4\\sigma j^{2 } ln(r - r')\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the elastic interaction strength ( the magnetic field dependence of the shear modulus @xmath42 is discussed in si ) and @xmath43 is the disorder strength . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d we calculate the spatial correlations of v(r ) ( first term in eq.1 ) by taking @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the topography and @xmath46 is the vortex energy per unit length ( see si for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath47 has long range logarithmic correlations and short range smooth periodic correlations at integer multiple of @xmath48 which are strongly damped at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> thus , incommensurate 1d correlation behaves as a quasi - random disorder potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we can write the free energy , @xmath49 , following available renormalization group ( rg ) theory for random disorder as@xcite : @xmath50 where the thermal @xmath51 and elastic energy @xmath52 ( the first and second term , respectively ) , and the disorder energy @xmath53 ( third term ) diverge logarithmically with the system size @xmath54@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 is the critical value for the disorder strength . in the ordered phase at low temperatures , </S>",

    "<S> 3a ) which corresponds to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate @xmath53 produced by @xmath47 ( using eq.1 and 2 ) and , independently , from the power law decaying of positional correlation functions ( using eq.2 and 3 and @xmath24 values from fig.3b ) . the result obtained at different magnetic fields is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e ( as blue and green circles , respectively ) together with the magnetic field evolution of @xmath52 ( black line ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath51 at 0.1k is three orders of magnitude below @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so it is negligible here . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between @xmath53 determined from exponents in correlation functions @xmath24 ( green circles ) and from logarithmic correlations in 1d disorder potential ( blue circles ) is nearly perfect . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the random uncorrelated potential generated by the 1d incommensurate surface corrugation drives the observed order - disorder transition in the 2d lattice . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3e shows that @xmath53 increases above @xmath52 at the magnetic field where we start to observe dislocations in the images .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us discuss on the critical behaviour of the observed transition . </S>",
    "<S> the order - disorder transition at zero temperature is expected , on the basis of rg calculations and models for random quenched disorder , at a disorder strength of @xmath58 and a critical exponent for the hexagonal lattice @xmath59@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments reproduce closely the expected features for the zero temperature phases as induced by a random disorder , with , in particular , positional fluctuations which increase as @xmath60 below the critical disorder and correlations decaying exponentially for high disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> but here we find critical values , @xmath61 and @xmath29 , which are far above the ones proposed in theory . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between random field theories and our experiments is the symmetry breaking 1d modulation . </S>",
    "<S> it produces the disorder through incommensuration and provides the energy scale for the random field driving the transition ( fig.3e ) . </S>",
    "<S> a recent proposal shows that the xy model with 1d symmetry breaking disorder has an increased order parameter at all temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an earlier work also points out that correlations in the disorder potential enhance the critical value of @xmath43@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the 1d modulation , by breaking symmetry , modifies the screening of the interactions among dislocations to enhance the critical point and exponents with respect to random field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiments show that , in presence of the 1d symmetry breaking disorder , the critical exponents increase up to the values expected by bkthny and that the microscopic disordering behaviour follows the sequence defined by the two - step thermal melting transition . </S>",
    "<S> inherent to this is the presence of an intermediate hexatic phase and of bound dislocations in the order phase which are not expected within random field models@xcite . in presence of random disorder </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the critical behaviour of the disorder transition at zero temperature is not of bkthny type@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question is why does our experiment follow bkthny ? to answer this question , one needs to calculate new critical points of the order - disorder transition at zero temperature by taking into account symmetry breaking correlations within randomness and their influence on the renormalization of the parameters involved in the transition . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments show that the 2d solid tends to flow into the bkthny behaviour with a reduction of the effect of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of creating disorder in two steps by unbinding and proliferation of topological defects describes possibly more phenomena than just 2d thermal melting .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , our data represent the first evidence that incommensurate 1d modulation widens the stability range of the ordered phase in 2d system at zero temperature and raise questions that will motivate a detailed examination of the effect of correlations in the critical behaviour of disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> 2d random environments are usually unavoidable in different fields , such as colloids , optical lattices , quantum condensates , 2d crystals or graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental approach presented here reveals an exciting new opportunity to produce coherence in the presence of 1d symmetry - breaking fields , as for example nematicity .    </S>",
