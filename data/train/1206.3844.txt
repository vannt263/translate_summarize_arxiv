    "understanding fermion masses and mixings is one of the outstanding problem of present day particle physics .",
    "the idea of quark mixing phenomena was initiated by cabibbo in 1963 @xcite , subsequently generalized to two generations by glashow , illiopoulos , maiani @xcite and finally to three generations by kobayashi and maskawa @xcite .",
    "this has been tested to a great accuracy and is well accommodated by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "recently , flavor mixing has also been observed in the case of neutrinos implying the existence of non zero , non degenerate neutrino masses necessitating the need to look beyond sm .",
    "also , one has to go beyond the sm in order to understand the pattern of quark masses and mixing parameters as in the sm the quark mass matrices are completely arbitrary . in view of the relationship of fermion mixing phenomena with that of fermion mass matrices , the understanding of the above mentioned issues of flavor physics essentially implies formulating fermion mass matrices .    while on the one hand , grand unified theories ( guts ) have provided vital clues for understanding the relationship of fermion mass matrices between quarks and leptons , on the other hand , horizontal symmetries @xcite have given clues for the relationship between different generation of fermions .",
    "ideas such as extra dimensions @xcite have also been invoked to understand the flavor puzzle .",
    "unfortunately , at present it seems that we do not have any theoretical framework which provides a viable and satisfactory description of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "the lack of a convincing fermion flavor theory from the ` top down ' perspective necessitates the need for formulating fermion mass matrices from a ` bottom up ' approach .",
    "the essential idea behind this approach is that one tries to find the phenomenological fermion mass matrices which are in tune with the low energy data and can serve as guiding stone for developing more ambitious theories . in this context ,",
    "initially several _ anstze _ @xcite were suggested for quark mass matrices .",
    "one of the successful _",
    "anstze _ incorporating the `` texture zero '' approach was initiated by fritzsch @xcite . _",
    "a particular texture structure is said to be texture @xmath0 zero , if it has @xmath0 number of non - trivial zeros , for example , if the sum of the number of diagonal zeros and half the number of the symmetrically placed off diagonal zeros is @xmath0_.    the detailed plan of the article is as follows . in section ( [ tsmm ] ) ,",
    "we discuss some of the broad features pertaining to quark and lepton texture specific mass matrices .",
    "the relationships of the fermion mass matrices and mixing matrices have been presented in section ( [ form ] ) .",
    "present status of the quark and neutrino mass and mixing parameters have been given in section ( [ inputs ] ) .",
    "the details pertaining to texture 6 , 5 , 4 zero quark and lepton mass matrices have respectively been presented in sections ( [ quarkmm ] ) and ( [ lepmm ] ) . finally , in section ( [ summ ] ) we summarize and conclude .",
    "the mass matrices , having their origin in the higg s fermion couplings , are arbitrary in the sm , therefore the number of free parameters available with a general mass matrix is larger than the physical observables .",
    "for example , if no restrictions are imposed , there are @xmath1 real free parameters in the two @xmath2 general complex mass matrices , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which in the quark sector need to describe ten physical observables , i.e. , six quark masses , three mixing angles and one cp violating phase .",
    "similarly , in the leptonic sector , physical observables described by lepton mass matrices are six lepton masses , three mixing angles and one cp violating phase for dirac neutrinos ( two additional phases in case neutrinos are majorana particles ) .",
    "therefore , to develop viable phenomenological fermion mass matrices one has to limit the number of free parameters in the mass matrices .    in this context , it is well known that in the sm and its extensions wherein the right handed fields in the lagrangian are su(2 ) singlets , without loss of generality , the mass matrices can be considered as hermitian .",
    "this immediately brings down the number of real free parameters from 36 to 18 , which however , is still a large number compared to the number of observables . to this end ,",
    "fritzsch @xcite initiated the idea of texture specific mass matrices which on the one hand imparted predictability to mass matrices while on the other hand , it paved the way for the phenomenology of texture specific mass matrices . to define the various texture specific cases , we present the typical fritzsch like texture specific hermitian quark mass matrices , for example , m_u= ( 0 & a _ u & 0 + a_u^ * & d_u & b_u + 0 & b_u^ * & c_u ) , m_d= ( 0 & a _ d & 0 + a_d^ * & d_d & b_d + 0 & b_d^ * & c_d ) , [ nf2zero ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to up and down mass matrices respectively . it may be noted that each of the above matrix is texture 2 zero type with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the texture 6 zero fritzsch mass matrices can be obtained from the above mentioned matrices by taking both @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be zero , which reduces the matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 each to texture 3 zero type .",
    "this fritzsch _ anstze _ @xcite as well as some other _ anstze _ @xcite were ruled out because of the large value predicted for @xmath12 due to the high ` t ' quark mass .",
    "further , a few other texture 6 zero mass matrices were analyzed by ramond , roberts and ross @xcite revealing that these matrices were again ruled out because the predicted value of @xmath12 came out to be much larger than the available data at that time .",
    "they also explored the question of connection between phenomenological quark mass matrices considered at low energies and the possible mass patterns at the gut scale and showed that the texture structure of mass matrices is maintained as we come down from gut scale to @xmath13 scale .",
    "this important conclusion also leads to the fact that the texture zeros of fermion mass matrices can be considered as phenomenological zeros , thereby implying that at all energy scales the corresponding matrix elements are sufficiently suppressed in comparison with their neighboring counterparts .",
    "this , therefore , opens the possibility of considering lesser number of texture zeros .    besides ramond",
    ", roberts and ross @xcite , several authors @xcite-@xcite then tried to explore the texture 5 zero quark mass matrices .",
    "fritzsch - like texture 5 zero matrices can be obtained by taking either @xmath10 = 0 and @xmath14 or @xmath15 and @xmath11 = 0 in eq .",
    "( [ nf2zero ] ) , thereby giving rise to two possible cases of texture 5 zero mass matrices pertaining to either @xmath3 or @xmath4 being texture 3 zero type while the other being texture 2 zero type .",
    "these analyses reveal that texture 5 zero mass matrices although not ruled out unambiguously yet are not able to reproduce the entire range of data .",
    "further , the issue of the phases of the mass matrices , responsible for cp violation , was not given adequate attention in these analyses .",
    "as an extension of texture 5 zero mass matrices , several authors @xcite-@xcite carried out the study of the implications of the fritzsch - like texture 4 zero mass matrices .",
    "it may be noted that fritzsch - like texture 4 zero mass matrices can be obtained by considering both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with non zero @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ nf2zero ] ) , to be texture 2 zero type .",
    "although from the above mentioned analyses one finds that texture 4 zero mass matrices were able to accommodate the quark mixing data quite well , however it may be noted that these analyses assumed ` strong hierarchy ' of the elements of the mass matrices as well as explored only their limited domains .",
    "further , in the absence of any precise information about cp violating phase @xmath17 and related parameters , again adequate attention was not given to the phases of the mass matrices .",
    "recent refinements in quark mixing data motivated several authors @xcite-@xcite to have a re - look at the compatibility of fritzsch like texture 4 zero mass matrices with the quark mixing data . in particular , using assumption of ` strong hierarchy ' of the elements of the mass matrix defined as @xmath18 , having its motivation in the hierarchy of the quark mixing angles several attempts @xcite-@xcite were made to predict the value of precisely known parameter sin@xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately , the value of sin@xmath19 predicted by these analyses came out to be in quite disagreement with its precisely known value .",
    "a somewhat detailed and comprehensive analyses of texture 4 zero quark mass matrices for the first time was carried out by xing and zhang @xcite , in particular they attempted to find the parameter space available to the elements of mass matrices .",
    "their analysis has also given valuable clues about the phase structure of the mass matrices , in particular for the strong hierarchy case they conclude that only one of the two phase parameters plays a dominant role .",
    "subsequently , attempts @xcite have been made to update and broaden the scope of the analysis carried out by xing and zhang @xcite , in particular regarding the structural features of the mass matrices having implications for the value of parameter sin@xmath19 .      in the leptonic sector",
    ", one would like to mention that the observation of neutrino oscillations has added another dimension to the issue of fermion masses and mixing .",
    "in fact , the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings seems to be vastly different from that of quarks . at present",
    ", the available neutrino oscillation data does not throw any light on the neutrino mass hierarchy , which may be normal/ inverted and may even be degenerate .",
    "further , the situation becomes complicated when one realizes that neutrino masses are much smaller than charged fermion masses as well as it is not clear whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated in case one has to understand the quark and neutrino mixing phenomena in a unified manner .    in this context , to understand the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings , texture zero approach has also been tried with good deal of success @xcite-@xcite . an early attempt to formulate lepton mass matrices was carried out by frampton , glashow and marfatia @xcite , wherein assuming a complex symmetric majorana mass matrix and considering seven possible texture 2 zero cases , they carried out the implications of these for the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "thereafter , several attempts were made using texture specific lepton mass matrics to explain the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "in particular , for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , fukugita , tanimoto and yanagida @xcite carried out an analysis of fritzsch - like texture 6 zero mass matrices .",
    "similarly , zhou and xing @xcite also carried out a systematic analysis of all possible texture 6 zero mass matrices for majorana neutrinos with an emphasis on normal hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "recently , @xcite for all possible hierarchies of neutrino masses , for both majorana as well as dirac neutrinos , detailed analyses of fritzsch - like texture 6 , 5 and 4 zero mass matrices was carried out .    from the above discussion",
    ", one finds that texture specific mass matrices are able to accommodate the quark as well as neutrino mixing data .",
    "this brings into fore the issue of quark - lepton unification , advocated by smirnov @xcite , by considering similar structures for quark and lepton mass matrices . keeping this in mind as well as in view of absence of any theoretical justification for fritzsch - like mass matrices",
    ", recent attempts @xcite were made to consider non fritzsch - like mass matrices for quarks as well as neutrinos .",
    "in the sm , the quark mass terms for three generations of quarks can be expressed as _ u_l m_u   q_u_r + q_d_l m_d   q_d_r , [ mc ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the left - handed ( right - handed ) quark fields for the up sector @xmath22 and down sector @xmath23 respectively .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass matrices for the up and the down sector of quarks . in order to re - express above equation in terms of the physical quark fields , one can diagonalize the mass matrices by the following bi - unitary transformations v_u_l^m_u v_u_r = m_u^diag ( m_u , m_c , m_t ) , [ v11 ] v_d_l^m_d v_d_r = m_d^diag ( m_d , m_s , m_b ) , [ v21 ] where @xmath24 are real and diagonal , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 etc . are complex unitary matrices .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 etc .",
    "denote the eigenvalues of the mass matrices , i.e. the physical quark masses .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ v11 ] ) and ( [ v21 ] ) , one can rewrite ( [ mc ] ) as _",
    "u_lv_u_lm_u^diag v_u_r^ q_u_r + _",

    "the mismatch of diagonalizations of up and down quark mass matrices leads to the quark mixing matrix , referred to as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix given as v_ckm = v_u_l^ v_d_l . [",
    "1mix ] the ckm matrix expresses the relationship between quark mass eigenstates @xmath30 which participate in the strong q@xmath31q and q@xmath32 interactions and the interaction eigenstates or flavor eigenstates @xmath33 which participate in the weak interactions and are the linear combinations of mass eigenstates , for example , ( d + s + b ) = ( v_ud & v_us & v_ub + v_cd & v_cs & v_cb + v_td & v_ts & v_tb + ) ( d + s + b ) , [ 1vckm]where @xmath34 , @xmath35 etc .",
    "describe the transition of @xmath36 to @xmath37 , @xmath36 to @xmath38 respectively , and so on .",
    "in view of the relationship of the mixing matrix with the mass matrix , a knowledge of the elements would have important implications for the mass matrices .",
    "the , by definition , is a unitary matrix , hence can be expressed in terms of three real angles and six phases . out of the six phases , five",
    "can be re - absorbed into the quark fields , therefore , one is left with only one non - trivial phase which is responsible for cp violation in the sm .",
    "there are several parameterizations of the sm , however the most commonly used parameterization is the standard parameterization given by particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "the pdg representation of the is given as v_ckm = ( c_12 c_13 & s_12 c_13 & s_13e^-i   + -s_12 c_23 - c_12 s_23 s_13e^i & c_12 c_23 - s_12 s_23s_13e^i & s_23 c_13 + s_12 s_23 - c_12 c_23 s_13e^i & - c_12 s_23 - s_12c_23 s_13e^i & c_23 c_13 ) , [ 1ckm ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be chosen to lie in the first quadrant , whereas the quadrant of @xmath17 has physical significance , therefore can not be fixed . in the pdg representation",
    ", sin@xmath43 implies the existence of cp violation . a precise measurement of elements and the parameters characterizing the pdg representation e.g. , mixing angles and cp violating phase @xmath44 will undoubtedly have implications for the mass matrices .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillation phenomenon which essentially implies the flavor conversion of neutrinos is similar to the quark mixing phenomenon .",
    "this possibility of flavor conversion was originally examined by b. pontecorvo and further generalized by maki , nakagawa and sakata @xcite . the emerging picture that neutrinos are massive and therefore mix has been proved beyond any doubt and provides an unambiguous signal of np .",
    "in the case of neutrinos , the generation of masses is not straight - forward as they may have either the dirac masses or the more general dirac - majorana masses .",
    "a dirac mass term can be generated by the higgs mechanism with the standard higgs doublet . in this case , the neutrino mass term can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 = @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the flavor eigenstates .",
    "@xmath53 is a complex @xmath54 dirac mass matrix .",
    "the mass term mentioned above would also be characterized by the same symmetry breaking scale such as that of charged leptons or quarks , therefore , in this case very small masses of neutrinos would be very unnatural from the theory point of view . on the other hand , the neutrino might be a majorana particle which is defined as is its own antiparticle and is characterized by only two independent particle states of the same mass ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 or @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) . a majorana mass term , which violates both the law of total lepton number conservation and that of individual lepton flavor conservation , can be written either as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are complex symmetric matrices .",
    "a simple extension of the sm is to include one right handed neutrino in each of the three lepton families , while the lagrangian of the electroweak interactions is kept invariant under @xmath62 gauge transformations .",
    "this can be shown to lead to dirac - majorana mass terms which further lead to the famous seesaw mechanism @xcite for the generation of small neutrino masses , e.g. , m_=-m_d^t(m_r)^-1m_d , [ seesaweq2 ] where @xmath53 and @xmath61 are respectively the dirac neutrino mass matrix and the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is based on the assumption that , in addition to the standard higgs mechanism of generation of the dirac mass term , there exists a beyond the sm mechanism of generation of the right - handed majorana mass term , which changes the lepton number by two and is characterized by a mass @xmath63 .",
    "the dirac mass term mixes the left - handed field @xmath64 , the component of a doublet , with a single field @xmath65 . as a result of this",
    "mixing the neutrino acquires majorana mass , which is much smaller than the masses of leptons or quarks .",
    "similar to the quark sector , the lepton mass matrices can be diagonalized by bi - unitary transformations and the corresponding mixing matrix obtained , known as pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) or lepton mixing matrix @xcite , is given as v_pmns= v^_l_l v__l .",
    "the pmns matrix expresses the relationship between the neutrino mass eigenstates and the flavor eigenstates , e.g. , ( _ e + _ + _ ) = ( v_e1 & v_e2 & v_e3 + v_1 & v_2 & v_3 + v_1 & v_2 & v_3 ) ( _ 1 + _ 2 + _ 3 ) , [ nm1 ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the flavor eigenstates , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the mass eigenstates and the @xmath2 mixing matrix is the leptonic mixing matrix @xcite . for the case of three dirac neutrinos , in the standard pdg parametrization @xcite , involving three angles @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath42 and the dirac - like cp violating phase @xmath74",
    "the mixing matrix has the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77 . in the case of the majorana neutrinos",
    ", there are extra phases which can not be removed .",
    "therefore , the above matrix takes the following form ( e^i _ 1/2 & 0 & 0 + 0 & e^i _ 2/2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 ) , [ nmm ] + where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the majorana phases which do not play any role in neutrino oscillations .",
    "to carry out any analysis regarding exploring the compatibility of fermion mass matrices with the recent data , one needs to keep in mind the experimental constraints imposed by the relationship between mass matrices and their corresponding mixing matrices . to facilitate our discussion in this regard , we first present the status of relevant data in the quark as well as in the lepton sector .      in the quark sector ,",
    "the most important constraints are provided by the directly observed quantities , such as masses of the quarks , elements , cp violating phase @xmath17 and @xmath80 , etc .. the quark masses relevant for the present work are the `` current '' quark masses at @xmath13 energy scale @xcite , e.g. , m_u = 1.27^+0.5_-0.42 mev ,  m_d = 2.90^+1.24_-1.19 mev ,   m_s=55^+16_-15 mev ,   +  m_c=0.619 0.084 gev ,   m_b=2.89 0.09 gev ,   m_t=171.7 3.0 gev .",

    ", on the one hand , many authors @xcite-@xcite have shown that on using strong hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices , texture 4 zero mass matrices appear to be incompatible with the recent value of sin@xmath19 . while on the other hand , recently @xcite extension of the parameter space of the elements of these matrices has been carried out to include the case of ` weak hierarchy ' amongst them along with the usually considered ` strong hierarchy ' case and thereby they have been shown to be compatible with the parameter sin@xmath19 .",
    "it may be noted that although hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices has been considered often while carrying out the analysis , however it has been explicitly defined only in @xcite .",
    "the various relations between the elements of the mass matrices , given in eq .",
    "( [ nf2zero ] ) , @xmath119 @xmath120 essentially correspond to the structural features of the mass matrices including their hierarchies .",
    "as is usual the element @xmath121 takes a value much smaller than the other three elements of the mass matrix which can assume different relations amongst each other , defining different hierarchies .",
    "for example , in case @xmath122 it would lead to a strongly hierarchical mass matrix whereas a weaker hierarchy of the mass matrix implies @xmath123 .",
    "it may also be added that for the purpose of numerical work , one can conveniently take the ratio @xmath124 characterizing strong hierarchy whereas @xmath125 implying weak hierarchy .",
    "the analysis carried out by @xcite incorporates the quark masses and their ratios mentioned in eqs .",
    "( [ qmasses])and ( [ ratios ] ) as well as by imposing the constraints given in eqs . ( [ vckm ] ) and ( [ sin ] ) .",
    "further , full variation has been given to the phases associated with the mass matrices @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 have been given wide variation in conformity with the hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices e.g. , @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "the extended range of these parameters allows the calculations for the case of weak hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices as well .    to begin with , in fig .",
    "1(a ) @xmath132 versus @xmath133 has been plotted .",
    "a look at the figure reveals that both @xmath134 as well as @xmath133 take values from @xmath135 , which interestingly indicates the ratios being almost proportional .",
    "also , the figure gives interesting clues regarding the role of strong and weak hierarchy .",
    "in particular , one finds that in case one restricts to the assumption of strong hierarchy then these ratios take large values around @xmath136 .",
    "however , for the case of weak hierarchy , the ratios @xmath132 and @xmath133 take much larger number of values , in fact almost the entire range mentioned above , which are compatible with the data .",
    "= 1.55 in    in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the plot of @xmath126 versus @xmath127 has been presented .",
    "interestingly , the present refined inputs limit the ranges of the two phases to @xmath137 and @xmath138 . keeping in mind that full variation has been given to the free parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 , corresponding to both strong as well as weak hierarchy cases , it may be noted that the allowed ranges of the two phases come out to be rather narrow .",
    "in particular , for the strong hierarchy case one gets @xmath139 , whereas for the case of weak hierarchy @xmath127 takes almost its entire range mentioned above .",
    "also , the analysis indicates that although @xmath140 , still both the phases are required for fitting the mixing data .    as a next step , the role of the hierarchy defining parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 has been emphasized . to this end , in fig .",
    "1(c ) @xmath141 versus @xmath142 has been given , representing an extended range of the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "a closer look at the figure reveals both @xmath143 as well as @xmath142 take values @xmath144 . the lower limit of the range i.e. when the ratios @xmath143 and @xmath142 are around @xmath145 corresponds to strong hierarchy amongst the elements of the mass matrices , whereas when the elements have weak hierarchy then these ratios take a much larger range of values . from this one",
    "may conclude that in the case of strongly hierarchical elements of the texture 4 zero mass matrices , one has limited compatibility of these matrices with the quark mixing data , whereas the weakly hierarchical ones indicate the compatibility for much broader range of the elements .",
    "having discussed the texture specific quark mass matrices , in the light of quark lepton unification hypothesis advocated by smirnov @xcite , one would also like to know the status of texture 6 zero fritzsch as well as non fritzsch - like lepton mass matrices .",
    "a detailed analysis of texture 6 zero mass matrices have been carried out by several authors @xcite . in particular , for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses zhou and xing @xcite have carried out an analysis of all possible fritzsch as well as non fritzsch - like texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices .",
    "their analysis has been extended further to include inverted hierarchy and non degenerate scenario of neutrino masses @xcite .    as already shown for the case of quarks in section([quarkmm ] ) , there are a total number of 144 possible cases of texture 6 zero mass matrices . for the case of lepton mass matrices",
    ", there are 6 cases for each of the 144 combinations corresponding to normal/ inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for majorana neutrinos as well as dirac neutrinos , leading to a total of 864 cases .",
    "the analysis carried out in @xcite reveals several interesting points . in particular , their investigations for dirac neutrinos show that there are no viable texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices for normal/ inverted hierarchy as well as degenerate scenario of neutrino masses . for the case of majorana neutrinos for texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices ,",
    "again all the cases pertaining to inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses are also ruled out . assuming normal hierarchy of majorana neutrinos , the analysis reveals that out of 144 , only 16 combinations are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at @xmath146 c.l ..      similar to the case of texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices , the implications for different hierarchies in the case of texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices have also been investigated for both majorana and dirac neutrinos @xcite .",
    "for the two types of neutrinos , corresponding to normal/ inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses 360 cases each have been considered for carrying out the analysis , making it a total of 2160 cases .    for majorana neutrinos with normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , out of the 360 combinations ,",
    "67 are compatible with the neutrino mixing data .",
    "most of the phenomenological implications of combinations of different categories are similar , however , still these can be experimentally distinguished with more precise measurements of @xmath42 and @xmath73 . interestingly , degenerate scenario of majorana neutrinos is completely ruled out by the existing data . in the case of inverted hierarchy ,",
    "24 combinations out of 360 are compatible with the neutrino mixing data .    for dirac neutrinos with normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , as compared to majorana cases , out of 360 only 44 combinations are compatible with neutrino mixing data .",
    "interestingly , 6 combinations out of 44 can accommodate degenerate dirac neutrinos .",
    "for inverted hierarchy , 24 combinations are compatible with the existing data .",
    "like the case of quarks , the number of viable possibilities for the case of texture 4 zero lepton mass matrices is also quite large , so in the present work we have discussed the essentials of recent detailed analyses @xcite regarding only the fritzsch - like texture 4 zero mass matrices . in particular , they have investigated the implications of different hierarchies of neutrino masses on these matrices for both majorana and dirac neutrinos .",
    "interestingly , at 3@xmath86 c.l . , their analysis rules out both inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for the two types of neutrinos .",
    "we reproduce here the essentials of their arguments .",
    "basically , they have plotted the parameter space corresponding to any of the two mixing angles by constraining the third angle by its experimental values , mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ s13 ] ) , while giving full allowed variation to other parameters . for ready reference we present these graphs in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] )",
    ". these plots immediately reveal that the inverted hierarchy is ruled out at 3@xmath86 c.l .. for example , from fig .",
    "( [ fig1]a ) , ( [ fig1]b ) and ( [ fig1]c ) , for majorana neutrinos , one can note that the plotted parameter space of the angles has no overlap with their experimentally allowed @xmath146 region .",
    "similar plots pertaining to dirac neutrinos also rule out inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "= 2.8 in    their analysis also shows that for majorana or dirac neutrinos the cases of neutrino masses being degenerate , characterized by either @xmath147 or @xmath148 corresponding to normal and inverted hierarchy respectively , are again ruled out . considering degenerate scenario corresponding to inverted hierarchy , fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) can again be used to rule out degenerate scenario at 3@xmath86 c.l . for majorana neutrinos .",
    "it needs to be mentioned that while plotting these figures the range of the lightest neutrino mass is taken to be @xmath149 , which includes the neutrino masses corresponding to degenerate scenario , therefore by discussion similar to the one given for ruling out inverted hierarchy , degenerate scenario of neutrino masses is ruled out as well .    coming to degenerate scenario corresponding to normal hierarchy",
    ", one can easily show that this is ruled out again . to this end , in fig .",
    "( [ th12vm - md ] ) , by giving full variation to other parameters , the plot of the mixing angle @xmath72 against the lightest neutrino mass @xmath150 have been presented .",
    "( [ th12vm - md]a ) corresponds to the case of majorana neutrinos and fig .",
    "( [ th12vm - md]b ) to the case of dirac neutrinos . from the figures one can immediately find that the values of @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath151 lie outside the experimentally allowed range , thereby ruling out degenerate scenario for majorana as well as dirac neutrinos at 3@xmath86 c.l ..    = 2.8 in",
    "after ruling out the cases pertaining to inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenarios , we come the normal hierarchy cases for majorana as well as dirac neutrinos . for both types of neutrinos , these yield viable ranges of neutrino masses , mixing angles @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath42 , jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter in the leptonic sector @xmath152 and the dirac - like cp violating phase in the leptonic sector @xmath153 the analysis reveals several interesting points . for both dirac or majorana neutrinos ,",
    "the viable range of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath150 is quite different , in particular the range corresponding to dirac neutrinos is much wider at both the ends as compared to the majorana neutrinos .",
    "therefore , a measurement of @xmath150 could have important implications for the nature of neutrinos .",
    "also , one finds that the lower limit on @xmath42 for the dirac case is considerably lower than for the majorana case , therefore a measurement of @xmath42 would have important implications for this case .",
    "the different cases of dirac and majorana neutrinos do not show any divergence for the ranges of jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter .",
    "fritzsch - like texture specific mass matrices have provided important clues for understanding the pattern of quark mixings and cp violation . likewise , in the leptonic sector also texture specific mass matrices are useful in explaining the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings . to tackle the larger issue of quark and lepton mixing phenomena together , it is perhaps desirable to take into account the quark - lepton unification hypothesis @xcite",
    "this immediately brings forth the issue of finding the simplest texture structure at the leading order , compatible with the quark and lepton mixing phenomena .",
    "further , in the absence of any theoretical justification for fritzsch - like mass matrices , one also needs to consider non fritzsch - like mass matrices for quarks as well as leptons .    in the present work ,",
    "we have given an overview of all possible cases of fritzsch - like as well as non fritzsch - like texture 6 and 5 zero fermion mass matrices , for details see @xcite .",
    "further , for the case of texture 4 zero fritzsch - like quark mass matrices , the issue of the hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices and the role of their phases have been discussed , details can be found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the case of texture 4 zero fritzsch - like lepton mass matrices has also been discussed with an emphasis on the hierarchy of neutrino masses for both majorana and dirac neutrinos , elaborate analyses presented in @xcite .",
    "these analyses reveal several interesting results . in principle , for the case of quarks @xcite , there are 144 combinations of texture 6 zero mass matrices whereas in the case of texture 5 zero matrices one can arrive at 360 combinations .",
    "interestingly , all the texture 6 zero combinations are completely ruled out whereas in the case of texture 5 zero mass matrices the only viable possibility looks to be that of fritzsch - like matrices which shows only limited viability , depending upon the light quark masses used as input .",
    "further , for the case of texture 4 zero quark mass matrices @xcite , including the case of ` weak hierarchy ' along with the usually considered ` strong hierarchy ' case , one finds that the weakly hierarchical mass matrices are able to reproduce the strongly hierarchical mixing angles .",
    "also , both the phases having their origin in the mass matrices have to be non zero to achieve compatibility of these matrices with the quark mixing data .",
    "the same number of combinations have been investigated for the neutrino mixing data considering normal/ inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for majorana as well as dirac neutrinos .",
    "texture 6 zero in the case of leptons results into 864 cases to be analyzed @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all the possibilities pertaining to normal/ inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for dirac neutrinos and inverted hierarchy as well as degenerate scenarios in the case of majorana neutrinos are ruled out .",
    "normal hierarchy of neutrino masses for majorana neutrinos results into 16 combinations out of 144 which are in accordance with the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "texture 5 zero entails considering 2160 cases to ascertain their compatibility with the neutrino mixing data @xcite .",
    "interestingly , one finds that texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices can accommodate all hierarchies of neutrino masses . in the case of normal hierarchy , 67 combinations for majorana neutrinos and 44 combinations for dirac neutrinos are compatible with the neutrino mixing data .",
    "there are 6 combinations , out of 44 , which can accommodate degenerate dirac neutrinos .",
    "further , in case of inverted hierarchy , 24 combinations are compatible both for majorana as well as dirac neutrinos .    for the fritzsch - like texture 4 zero neutrino mass matrices @xcite ,",
    "analysis pertaining to both majorana and dirac neutrinos for different hierarchies of neutrino masses reveals that for both types of neutrinos , all the cases pertaining to inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenarios of neutrino masses are ruled out at @xmath146 c.l . by the existing data . for the normal hierarchy cases ,",
    "one gets viable ranges of neutrino masses , mixing angle @xmath154 , jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter @xmath152 and the cp violating dirac - like phase @xmath153 .",
    "interestingly , a measurement of @xmath150 and mixing angle @xmath42 could have important implications for the nature of neutrinos .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to remark that on the one hand there is a need to take the analysis of texture specific mass matrices towards completion .",
    "for example , besides carrying out the analysis of texture 4 zero non fritzsch - like fermion mass matrices , one has to consider texture 3 zero cases also , the latter corresponding to general mass matrices after carrying out weak basis rotations . on the other hand , one may also consider breaking the hermiticity condition perturbatively as has been done recently @xcite and to go into its detailed implications .",
    "similarly , the issue of phases of mass matrices and their relationship with the cp violating parameters also needs a careful look and detailed investigations .",
