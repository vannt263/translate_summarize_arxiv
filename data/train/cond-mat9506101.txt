    "how is the critical behavior affected by the introduction of disorder ( usually dilution or bond  randomness ) into a model ? this question has been extensively studied@xcite experimentally , analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite for quite some time now .",
    "many studies concentrate on finding out to which universality class certain disordered models belong , e.g. calculating critical exponents . in this work",
    "we consider a different aspect of the same question .",
    "the measurement of any _ density _ of an extensive thermodynamic property @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath21 or @xmath6 ) in a disordered system may hypothetically be done in the following way .",
    "an ensemble of macroscopic disordered samples of size @xmath2 is prepared ; denote by @xmath22 a sample with a particular random realization of the quenched disorder .",
    "now in each sample @xmath22 , @xmath23 is measured over a long time interval , and @xmath24 , the average over time @xmath25 is calculated .",
    "close to the critical point the measurement of @xmath24 will require long times due to large thermal fluctuations which will occur .",
    "in addition , since in every sample a different configuration of the quenched disorder is present , a different value for @xmath24 will be measured .",
    "next , the average of @xmath24 over the ensemble @xmath26 $ ] ( @xmath27 $ ] stands for an ensemble average over the different samples ) is calculated and so is its variance @xmath28 \\}^{2 } ] \\;. \\label{eq : v_p}\\ ] ] assume that the time interval of the measurement was long enough so that thermal fluctuations in @xmath23 were averaged out perfectly and @xmath24 may be considered to be exact .",
    "the question then rises : how will the variance @xmath1 change as the critical temperature is approached or as the correlation length @xmath29@xcite is increased ?",
    "this question , which concerns the way in which disorder affects the behavior of systems near their critical point , is approached in this work using the framework of finite size scaling .",
    "a common practice in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations is to examine the critical behavior by simulating a system at its critical temperature @xmath30 and changing the lattice size @xmath2 . according to the theory of finite size scaling@xcite the lattice size @xmath2 sets the scale of the correlation length in such a finite system .",
    "thus the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath29 in an infinite system close to criticality is substituted by dependence on @xmath2 in a finite system at criticality . when a disordered system is considered then",
    "many samples need to be simulated in order to obtain estimates of @xmath0 which are averaged over the disorder . in this case , the question , which is the main theme of this work , would be : how does the effect of disorder on the sample to sample fluctuations in @xmath24 change , as the lattice size @xmath2 is increased at the critical temperature ? or how does @xmath1 scale with @xmath2 ?",
    "this question is not only of theoretical interest in its own right , but also of practical interest for mc studies of critical disordered systems .",
    "if the relative variance @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] decreases with increasing @xmath2 then the number of samples needed to obtain [ p ] to a given accuracy goes down with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] is independent of @xmath2 , then the number of samples which need to be simulated is independent of @xmath2 and the total amount of work rises very strongly with @xmath2 .    the issue which we study in this work should not be confused with two closely related issues .",
    "the first is usually referred to as the property of self - averaging of additive ( extensive ) quantities in disordered systems@xcite .",
    "consider again the ensemble of macroscopic disordered samples of size @xmath2 .",
    "the question is then whether @xmath32 ^ 2 \\rightarrow 0 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; { \\text as } \\ ; l\\rightarrow \\infty \\;. \\label{eq : self}\\ ] ] if so , then the measurement of @xmath24 in one very large sample @xmath22 which occurs with reasonable probability will provide a good estimate of the ensemble average .",
    "this is very important for the comparison of theoretical work , where the configurational average is taken , with experiments , where only a large single sample is examined . as first argued by brout@xcite",
    ", we may divide the sample @xmath22 into @xmath33 large subsamples ( much larger than the correlation length @xmath29 ) .",
    "if we assume that the coupling between neighboring subsystems is negligible , then the value of any density of an extensive quantity over the whole sample is equal to the average of the ( independent ) values of this quantity over the subsamples . provided the probability distribution of the @xmath0 s of the subsamples has a finite variance , then according to the central limit theorem the value of @xmath24 is distributed with a gaussian probability distribution around its mean @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the square of the width of the gaussian , @xmath1 , is proportional to @xmath34 . in this case ( [ eq :",
    "self ] ) is fulfilled , and @xmath0 is called self - averaging .    the quantities which are studied here",
    "are all densities of extensive self averaging quantities ( far from criticality ) .",
    "nonetheless , note that our question , as it was formulated for macroscopic samples ( @xmath35 ) , concerned the dependence of @xmath36 on the correlation length @xmath29 and not on the sample size @xmath2 . on the other hand , as we will examine finite samples of size @xmath2 at criticality where @xmath37 , the brout argument does not hold , since the average of @xmath0 over neighboring subsamples may not be considered as independent .",
    "thus at criticality there is no reason to expect that @xmath3 .",
    "an example for a phase transition , where sample to sample fluctuations result in non self averaging of certain quantities , is the percolation transition .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the resistive susceptibility and the conductivity are non self averaging at the percolation threshold .",
    "a second related issue is that of self - averaging in homogeneous systems .",
    "this question concerns the thermal fluctuations in the value of a density @xmath0 in a homogeneous system of size @xmath2 .",
    "define the thermal variance as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes thermal or time averaging .",
    "the following notions ( slightly modified ) have been introduced by milchev binder and heermann@xcite : if @xmath40 as @xmath41 then @xmath0 is self averaging otherwise it is said to exhibit lack of self averaging . if @xmath42 then @xmath0 is strongly self averaging . if @xmath43 then @xmath0 is weakly self averaging .",
    "when @xmath44 it was found@xcite that averages of simple densities such as @xmath45 are strongly self averaging while quantities obtained from the fluctuations of these densities such as the specific heat @xmath46 and susceptibility @xmath6 are non self averaging . at criticality",
    "the singular part of the energy @xmath8 is weakly self averaging while @xmath46 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 exhibit lack of self averaging .",
    "for example @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that @xmath5 is non self averaging .    the issues of self averaging in disordered systems and homogeneous systems concern the asymptotic behaviour of the fluctuations due to disorder and the thermal fluctuations respectively as the system size is increased .",
    "while self averaging in homogeneous systems at criticality has been addressed previously@xcite , this study involves the question of self averaging in disordered systems at criticality . with the increase in the available computational power ,",
    "a numerical investigation of the sample to sample fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities is nowadays feasible ( whereas previously only calculation of the ensemble average , which is less demanding computationally , was feasible ) .",
    "the particular model which is used here to study the question of the self averaging of fluctuations due to disorder at criticality is the bond - disordered ashkin - teller model on a square lattice .",
    "actually this work is based on further analysis of results which were obtained in a previous mc study@xcite which aimed to determine the universality class of the model .",
    "the random - bond ashkin - teller model is particularly suitable for studying the effects of disorder on critical behavior .",
    "this is because the pure model possesses a line of critical points along which critical exponents vary continuously . in particular",
    ", the scaling exponent corresponding to randomness @xmath49 varies continuously and is positive .",
    "thus , according to the harris criterion@xcite , randomness is a relevant operator of varying strength , and the critical behaviour of the disordered model was indeed found to differ from that of the pure system .",
    "our conclusion in the present work is that the effective exponent ratio @xmath50 of a disordered model plays a central role in determining the self averaging of the fluctuations due to disorder at criticality . for the susceptibility , for instance",
    ", our results agree very well with a finite size scaling theory which we develop , according to which the relative variance of the susceptibility , @xmath51 ^ 2 $ ] , scales as @xmath52 at the critical temperature .",
    "this implies lack of self averaging when @xmath53 ( as is found for the random bond ashkin - teller model ) and only weak self averaging for negative @xmath12 . our theory is successful also in describing , for models with weak disorder , the effect of crossover on the variance .",
    "+ our finite size scaling theory is very similar to the physical arguments that lead to the harris criterion@xcite , which was derived near the pure system fixed point .",
    "the difference is that we are assuming that similar considerations are valid near the disordered fixed point as well .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we define the random bond ashkin - teller model ( rbat ) and summarize its critical properties as found in a previous study@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vardef ] we define various variances of thermodynamic quantities in disordered systems and explain their meaning .",
    "we explain how the ` sample to sample variance ' can be estimated from mc results . in section 3",
    "we display our results for several bond disordered ashkin  teller models , including the four - state potts and ising models . we have measured the ` sample to sample variance ' at criticality for different lattice sizes and also for different degrees of disorder .",
    "we discuss some qualitative features of these results , such as the apparent lack of self averaging and the dependence on the amount of disorder and on the specific heat exponent @xmath12 . in section 4",
    "we develop a phenomenological finite size scaling theory for the ` sample to sample variance ' . in section 5",
    "we compare the predictions of the theory with the numerical results .",
    "we find good agreement in the case of the susceptibility and the energy , while the agreement in the case of the specific heat and magnetization is more questionable .",
    "the model we study is the _ random - bond _ at model ( rbat ) on a square lattice .",
    "on every site of the lattice two ising spin variables , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are placed . denoting by @xmath56 a pair of nearest neighbor sites , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath57 \\;.",

    "this critical line interpolates between the ising and four state potts models .",
    "even though the scaling exponent corresponding to randomness , @xmath62 , also varies continuously along this line , it takes positive values , ( @xmath63 ) , so that randomness is relevant .",
    "indeed the critical behaviour of the disordered model was found to be different from that of the pure one@xcite . in a duality transformation",
    "was used to locate a critical plane of the disordered model ; the random model is critical when @xmath64 are the dual couplings of @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "this critical plane corresponds to the line of critical points of the pure model , along which critical exponents vary continuously .",
    "a finite size scaling study was performed for several critical models , extrapolating between the critical bond - disordered ising and four state potts models .",
    "the critical behaviour of each disordered model was compared with the critical behaviour of an anisotropic ashkin - teller model which was used as a reference pure model@xcite . whereas we found no essential change induced by randomness in the order parameters critical exponents , the divergence of the specific heat @xmath46 did change dramatically .",
    "our results favor a logarithmic type divergence at @xmath66 , @xmath67 for the entire critical manifold of the random bond ashkin - teller model , including the four state potts model , but excluding the random bond ising model , for which @xmath68 was obtained .    here",
    "we give some of the details of the simulations and our main numerical results for the critical behavior .",
    "these are necessary for understanding and analyzing our variance results .",
    "all the results listed here were presented in detail in ; some essential points are reviewed here for completeness sake .",
    "two series of critical rbat models were studied in order to monitor two effects .",
    "the first series of measurements were performed at five models ( or points in the couplings space ) , @xmath69 , which we label as @xmath70 .",
    "these were chosen so as to interpolate between @xmath71 , which is a random - bond ising critical point ( @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73 , which is a random - bond four - state potts critical point ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the points @xmath75 interpolate in a similar manner to the way in which the critical line of the pure at connects the pure ising critical point with the pure four - state potts critical point .",
    "the extent of deviation from pure behavior is determined by the difference between the two sets of couplings . for the series @xmath70 the ratio of @xmath76 was chosen , i.e. @xmath77 so that randomness will be pronounced@xcite .",
    "two additional measurement points ( or models ) were intended to monitor the effect of varying the amount of randomness on the critical behaviour .",
    "the points @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 represent three rbat models with coupling ratios @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "thus the model @xmath78 possesses the lowest degree of randomness , while the model @xmath80 possesses the highest degree of randomness . the usual definitions for energy @xmath8 , specific heat @xmath46 , magnetization @xmath5@xcite , susceptibility @xmath6 , polarization @xmath83 , and susceptibility of the polarization @xmath84 were used .",
    "since the specific heat seems to play a dominant role in the behavior of the variance , we elaborate on the specific heat results , and even reproduce one graph . for the specific heat we found excellent agreement with the finite size scaling form @xmath85\\ ; , \\label{eq : c fss cross}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the critical exponent ratio of the corresponding anisotropic ( pure@xcite ) model .",

    "in this section we draw some more conclusions based on the finite size scaling form ( [ eq : psing ] ) , without making any assumptions on the explicit @xmath22 dependence of the coefficients of @xmath208",
    ". what can we deduce about the coefficients of @xmath208 from the brout argument ?",
    "consider ( [ eq : psing ] ) in the limit @xmath297 , @xmath211 finite . in this case",
    "@xmath29 is finite , the brout argument holds , and one expects @xmath298 to be sample independent .",
    "this means that in this limit we expect the coefficients of @xmath208 and its argument to converge to some @xmath22 independent values .",
    "it follows that we can assume that these coefficients are distributed according to some unknown distribution function whose width @xmath299 depends on @xmath2 and tends to zero as @xmath297 .",
    "is there any limit in which one may recover the usual finite size scaling behaviour , completely independent of the specific sample @xmath22 ? consider the limit @xmath2 large but finite and @xmath300 .",
    "let us now add the assumption that the width @xmath299 tends to zero no slower than @xmath220 .",
    "then for large enough @xmath2 , according to equations ( [ eq : width]-[eq : tx dot ] ) , @xmath211 approaches @xmath301 given by @xmath302 as @xmath220 , and @xmath303 so that we recover the usual@xcite finite size scaling behaviour .",
    "the limit ( [ eq : qlargel ] ) can not account for the large sample to sample fluctuations that we have numerically observed at @xmath224 even for rather large values of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , special care is needed in the case @xmath224 , where @xmath304 is not small and the brout argument does not hold .",
    "it turns out that in this case the limit , where the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath211 can be ignored as in ( [ eq : qlargel ] ) , does not occur or is reached ` slowly ' . when @xmath224 , then @xmath305 , so that according to ( [ eq : width ] ) and ( [ eq : tc scaling ] ) @xmath211 is a difference of a fluctuating term of order @xmath220 and a term of a constant sign of order @xmath306 .",
    "therefore @xmath307    thus for @xmath224 and positive @xmath12 ,  @xmath308 for large @xmath2 and ( [ eq : qlargel ] ) is not justified . in this case",
    "the relative fluctuations in the argument of @xmath208 are of order 1 and their absolute magnitude scales as @xmath309 so that it increases with @xmath2 .",
    "so for large @xmath2 the argument of @xmath208 is a constant plus a large fluctuating quantity which increases with @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that @xmath208 can not be expanded as is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : scale var ] , and that the limit ( [ eq : qlargel ] ) does not exist .    for negative @xmath12",
    "it follows that the fluctuations in the argument of @xmath208 scale as @xmath310 . since we have assumed that the fluctuations in the coefficients of @xmath208 , @xmath299 , scale as @xmath220 then if @xmath311 then at @xmath224  @xmath299 decreases faster than the fluctuations in the argument of @xmath208 .",
    "thus one may consider the range of @xmath2 for which @xmath312 where only the argument of @xmath208 is @xmath22 dependent . in this case",
    "the coefficients of @xmath313 are some constants for which we need not assume anything about their @xmath22 or @xmath2 dependence .",
    "consideration of the limit ( [ eq : qlargel no x ] ) suffices to reach our main result ( [ eq : vlead ] ) ( but not corrections to ( [ eq : vlead ] ) ) , independent of the assumptions made in sec . [",
