    "shapiro resonance is one of the most remarkable properties of the superconducting device , in which , two weakly coupled superconductors are subject to a voltage difference that is the sum of a dc component @xmath0 and a periodic signal @xmath1 . a continuous range of nonzero dc currents are possible if @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cooper pair charge , @xmath4 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath5 is an integershap63,barone . the shapiro resonance provides a method to measure the constant of nature @xmath6 with such precision and universalitybloc70,fult73 that , since 1972 , the reversed view has been adopted whereby @xmath6",
    "is assumed to be known and the above shapiro resonance is used to define a standard unit of voltage@xcite .    essentially , the shapiro resonance is a specific phenomenon emerged when the frequency of the external field is commensurate with the intrinsic frequency of system .",
    "recently , it has received renewed interests and investigations in the bose - einstein condensates(bec)@xcite .",
    "for example , in bec josephson junction , the dc value of the drift current shows up as resonant spikes@xcite . under experimentally accessible conditions there",
    "exist well - developed half - integer shapiro - like resonances@xcite .",
    "shapiro effect also allows precise measurements in atomic becs .",
    "the ac - driven atomic josephson devices can be used to define a standard of chemical potential@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend to investigate the shapiro resonance effects in ultracold molecule production .",
    "the conversion of ultracold atoms to ultracold molecules by time varying magnetic fields in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance is currently a topic of much experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "this particular conversion process lends itself well to the formation of molecular bose - einstein condensates ( becs)greiner , prl91 - 250401,jochim , prl92 - 120401 and atom - molecule superpositions@xcite .",
    "these feshbach molecules and their creation process are also important for understanding ultracold fermionic systems in the bcs - bec crossover regime because they are closely related to the pairing mechanism in a fermionic superfluid that occurs near a feshbach resonanceholland , timmermans , ketterlebcs , greinerbcs .",
    "we study the process of production of ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms using a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field modulation .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it greatly reduces the heating the cloud experiences in the conversion process because the conversion occurs far from the center of the feshbach resonance . in recent experiments ,",
    "this technique has been applied and was shown could produce molecules from atoms more efficiently@xcite and measure the binding energy of feshbach molecule precisely .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism is not fully understood , the complexity arises from the many - body problem and time - dependent field involved .",
    "the many experimental observations can not be accounted for by the existing theoretical model .",
    "for example , the poisson distribution predicted by theory@xcite is departure from the observed lorentzian - like resonance profiles and how the finite - temperature effect influences the resonance profiles is still an open problem . in the present paper ,",
    "we exploit a microscopic two - channel model to investigate thoroughly the mechanism underlying the shapiro resonance phenomenon in the atom - molecule conversion . with quantitatively considering the thermal dephasing effect in the uncondensed",
    "atom clouds our model could account for the most experimental observations .",
    "our theory also suggests some interesting predictions for future s experimental test .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present our model and make a thorough analysis on the shapiro resonance . in sec .",
    "iii , with the inclusion of the dephasing effect in our model , we apply our theory to explain the recent experiment . in sec .",
    "iv , we extend to discuss the shapiro resonance for the case of condensed atoms with emphasizing on the influence from the interaction between coherent particles .",
    "v is our conclusion .",
    "ignoring the two- and three - body atomic decay and collisional molecular decay , we exploit the following two - channel microscopic model to describe the dynamics of converting atoms to molecules in the bosonic system , @xmath7 here @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10(@xmath11 ) are bose annihilation ( creation ) operators of atoms and molecules , respectively . the total number of particles @xmath12 is a conserved constant .",
    "the atomic and molecular kinetic energies are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 governs the atom - molecule coupling strength , @xmath17 denotes the quantization volume of trapped particles and therefore @xmath18 is the mean density of initial bosonic atoms . where @xmath19 represents the binding energy of diatomic molecules which depends on the external field , expressed approximately as@xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the effective range of the van der waals potential , @xmath22 is the mass of a bosonic atom , and @xmath23 denotes the effective scattering length driven by external magnetic field , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background scattering length , @xmath26 is the feshbach resonance position , @xmath27 is the width of the resonance defined through the relation with the atom - molecule coupling term @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the difference in magnetic moment between the closed channel and the open channel state .",
    "we focus on the situation that the selected external field @xmath30 is modulated sinusoidally with small amplitude @xmath31 and large frequency @xmath32 near a feshbach resonance , i.e. , @xmath33 since @xmath34 , the binding energy can be expanded into series to the first order of @xmath31 @xmath35 where @xmath36 ^ 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath37 ^ 3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we introduce the angular momentum operators to investigate the dynamics of this system@xcite , @xmath38 with the commutators @xmath39&= & \\frac{4i}{n}\\hat{l}_y ,   \\label{lzlx } \\\\ \\left[\\hat{l}_z,\\hat{l}_y \\right]&= & -\\frac{4i}{n}\\hat{l}_x ,   \\label{lzly } \\\\ \\left[\\hat{l}_x,\\hat{l}_y \\right ] & = & \\frac{i}{n}\\left(1-\\hat{l}% _ z\\right)\\left(1 + 3\\hat{l}_z\\right ) + \\frac{4i}{n^2}.   \\label{lxly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy difference between atoms and molecules , and parameter @xmath42 denotes the coupling strength .",
    "then the heisenberg equations of motion are @xmath43 since @xmath44 is large for the current experiments and all the commutators vanish in the limit of @xmath45 , it is appropriate to take @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 as three real numbers @xmath49 , respectively",
    ". then we get the mean - field heisenberg equations @xmath50 in order to get the time - averaged value of the conversion varied with different external field , we characterize each quantum trajectory by its time - averaged imbalance @xmath51 employing the averaging interval @xmath52 . initially , all particles are atoms .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the results of such calculations by numerical solving the heisenberg equations([dlxdt]-[dlzdt ] ) for @xmath53 under periodic modulation with fixed scaled amplitude @xmath54 and frequencies @xmath55 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the solution of the mean - field equations ( [ dudt]-[dwdt ] ) is also presented .",
    "there are several clear spikes which indicate the shapiro - like resonance in atom - molecule conversion driven by external magnetic field",
    ".     for the driven system with different numbers of particles , tilt @xmath58 , and scaled driving amplitude @xmath59.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    these spikes indicate that the frequency of the modulated field is commensurate with the intrinsic frequencies of the atom - molecule conversion system in the absence of the periodic modulation .",
    "now we analyze the intrinsic frequency . for @xmath60 , using fock state as basis , the commutators ( [ lzlx]-[lxly ] ) becomes @xmath39&= & 2i\\hat{l}_y , \\quad \\left[\\hat{l}_z,\\hat{%",

    "so the center of resonance is expected to be @xmath63 with @xmath64 are integers . in our case , the resonances corresponding to @xmath65 are more prominent . with @xmath66 increasing , we find that the resonance center shifts to right due to the many - body effect .",
    "we can obtain the intrinsic frequency in the mean - field limit , i.e .",
    ", @xmath67 . from the mean - field equations([dudt]-dwdt ) we readily obtain , @xmath68 initially all particles are in atom states , i.e. , @xmath69 . approximately substituting it into the above equation we obtain the explicit expression of the frequency @xmath70 .",
    "it implies that due to the many - body effect@xcite , the resonance centers shifts to @xmath71 .",
    "the above theoretical analysis agree with our numerical results .",
    "the shapiro resonance phenomenon can be demonstrated intuitively by the trajectories in phase space of the system .",
    "notice that the constraint @xmath72 and introducing the canonical variable @xmath73 , @xmath74 denoting the population imbalance and the relative phase between atoms and molecules , the mean - field heisenberg equations can be replaced by a classical hamiltonian of the form @xmath75 the canonical equations of motions are @xmath76using a generation function @xmath77with following relations @xmath78we obtain the new hamiltonian @xmath79 the secular evolution of @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be evaluated from the time - averaged hamiltonian , @xmath82 with @xmath83    now , we consider the 1:1 resonance case that @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the first kind bessel function .",
    "the phase graph of the periodic averaged hamiltonian system reflects the poincar section of hamiltonian system ( [ claham ] ) , as shown in fig.[poin ] . for the case of off - resonance , the integral in eq.([integ ] ) approximates to zero , it implies that the time - averaged @xmath87 varies a little in time while the variable @xmath88 increases with time almost linearly .",
    "the corresponding poincar section is shown in fig.[poin](b ) .",

    "these regions are named as arnold tongues@xcite . in order to draw out the arnold tongues in parameter space ,",
    "the main numerical tool used in this work is the winding number @xmath97 @xmath98 with initial conditions @xmath99 .",

    "only @xmath109 type is significant . in fig.[tongues ] we show the first five resonance regions with @xmath110 .",
    "the width of the resonance regions is broadened as the modulation amplitude @xmath96 increases .",
    "in the above discussion we use the single - mode model to discuss the conversion between the condensed atoms and molecules . this is an approximation because in practical experiments the atoms are not condensed and other modes will be coupled .",
    "we use this approximation under the condition that the energy distribution of the thermal particles ( characterized by @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the boltzman constant and @xmath113 is the temperature ) is much smaller than the effective feshbach resonance width @xmath114@xcite . in such cases ,",
    "each energy band of the thermal particles can be approximately denoted by one energy level , as schematically plotted by fig.[schematic ] .",
    "initially , the particles on one level have a definite phase and the phase difference between two levels is well defined .",
    "however , as the magnetic field sweeps and then the sinusoidal magnetic field applied , particles will acquire additional phases that are proportional to their individual energy and evolution time .",
    "the varied particles in one level could acquire different phases because they have different energies .",
    "this define a dephasing rate @xmath115@xcite .",
    "to to compare with experiment , we need to include the dephasing effect into our model .",
    "modeling dephasing by fully include the quantum effects requires sophisticated theoretical studies .",
    "the standard approaches of quantum optics for open systems involve quantum kinetic master equations . here",
    ", we adopt the simple mean - field treatment in our model . from the mean - field viewpoint ,",
    "the decoherence term introduces a @xmath116 transversal relaxation term into the mean - field equations of motion@xcite , @xmath117 the imbalance of atom - pairs and molecules @xmath118 is varied in the range of @xmath119 $ ] with the lower limit corresponding to a pure atomic gas and @xmath120 for a pure molecular gas .",
    "what we concern is that after the conversion process how many atomic pairs are converted to molecule .",
    "we use @xmath121 to denote the value of @xmath118 when the magnetic field sweep back .",
    "the molecular conversion efficiency can be read from the variable @xmath122 as @xmath123 .        , e.g. , for @xmath124 , the fitting parameters are @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 . in the subfigure , by fitting the linewidth versus conversion data to a straight line we find the zero conversion limit to be @xmath129.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and frequency @xmath130 with respect to coupling time for different temperatures .",
    "the conversion of ultracold atoms to molecules increases with coupling time until it becomes saturated at @xmath131.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now we apply our theory to the experiment of @xmath132rb by ref.prl95-190404 .",

    "our linewidth is approximately @xmath129 at zero conversion limit , as shown in the subfigure . in the experiment ,",
    "it is about @xmath167 .    in our calculation",
    ", we find that , in the three stages of magnetic field change expressed by eq.([bfield ] ) , the linear process contributes little to the atom - molecule conversion .",
    "this is because oscillation center @xmath30 is still far away from the feshbach resonance center .",
    "the atom - molecule conversion mainly occurs in the process of applying the sinusoidal magnetic field , where @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the above observed resonance phenomenon corresponds to the shapiro resonance discussed in the last section , while the linewidth is dramatically broadened by the thermal dephasing effect .    in fig.[relaxation ] , we show the conversion efficiency with respect to coupling time . for temperature @xmath156 ,",
    "density @xmath157 , our results are close to experimental data .",
    "we also show the cases of different temperatures by considering the isobaric condition , i.e. , @xmath169 .",

    "the conversion efficiency decreases with the increasing of temperature .",
    "for different temperature , a common feature is that the conversion efficiency increases with coupling time until it becomes saturated at @xmath131 .",

    "it implicitly depends on the density through parameter @xmath181 . in the experiment ,",
    "the density of condensed atoms is about ten times larger than that of thermal cloud , therefore the resonance center shift to the right - hand compared to fig.5 of the thermal atomic cloud case .",
    "moreover , we find that the interaction between the coherent atoms will lead to the shift of the resonance profile as clearly shown in fig.8 .",
