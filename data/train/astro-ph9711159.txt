    "the search for clustering of the lyman-@xmath0 lines has produced along the years diverse results .",
    "systematic studies of the distribution of redshifts in the qso lyman-@xmath0 forest began in the early 80 s with the work by sargent et al .",
    "@xcite who concluded that no structures could be identified .",
    "almost all the subsequent results have failed to detect any significant correlation on velocity scales @xmath1 km s@xmath2 @xcite . on smaller scales",
    "( @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ) there have been indications of weak clustering @xcite , together with relevant non - detections @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "metal - line systems selected by means of the civ doublet have been early recognized to show strong clustering up to 600 km s@xmath2 @xcite , suggesting a different spatial distribution .",
    "in fact , the absence of power in the two - point correlation function has been claimed as a striking characteristic of the lyman-@xmath0 forest and has been used as a basic argument to develop a scenario of the lyman-@xmath0 absorbers as a totally distinct population with respect to metal systems and therefore galaxies .",
    "our analysis of the clustering of the lyman-@xmath0 lines is based on data obtained in the framework of an eso key - programme devoted to the study of qso absorption systems at high redshifts .",
    "we have obtained spectra of several qsos , with emission redshifts ranging from 3.27 to 4.12 , at resolution between 9 and 14 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we have complemented our data with other spectra available in the literature with similar resolution and redshift range , @xcite obtaining a final sample of 14 qsos ( in the following _ extended sample _ ) , more than 1600 lyman-@xmath0  s , a suitable database to investigate clustering , especially at high redshift , where the density of lines provides particular sensitivity .",
    "to study the clustering properties of our sample of lyman-@xmath0 lines we have adopted the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) in the velocity space : @xmath4 in our case sample @xmath5 , the number of pairs expected in a given velocity bin from a random distribution in redshift , is obtained averaging 1000 numerical simulations of the observed number of redshifts , trying to account for all the relevant cosmological and observational effects .",
    "in particular the set of redshifts is randomly generated in the same redshift interval as the data according to the cosmological distribution @xmath6 , where the best value of @xmath7 has been derived from a maximum likelihood analysis @xcite .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath8 adopted .",
    "incomplete wavelength coverage due to gaps in the spectrum or line blanketing of weak lines due to strong complexes is also accounted for .",
    "lines with too small velocity splittings , compared with the finite resolution or the intrinsic blending are excluded in the estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting correlation function for the full _ extended sample _ of lyman@xmath9 lines shows a weak but significant signal , with @xmath10 in the 100 km s@xmath2 bin : 739 pairs are observed while only 624 are expected for a random distribution , a @xmath11 deviation from poissonianity .",
    "we have then explored the variations of the clustering as a function of the column density . for lines with @xmath12",
    "no evidence for clustering is present . on the contrary , for lines with @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the correlation function at @xmath14 km s@xmath2 shows a remarkable increase in amplitude ( @xmath15 ) and significance : 234 pairs are observed while only 145 are expected for a random distribution , a more than @xmath16 deviation from poissonianity .",
    "no relevant feature other than the peak at small velocity separations is observed .",
    "in particular previous claims for anti - clustering on scales @xmath17 km s@xmath2 are not confirmed .",
    "[ figclustew ] shows more in detail the variation of the amplitude of the two - point correlation as a function of the column density .",
    "a trend of increasing amplitude with increasing column density is apparent .",
    "we have also studied the evolution of the tpcf with the redshift for the sub - sample of lyman-@xmath0 lines with column densities @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation at @xmath19 km s@xmath2 decreases with increasing redshift from @xmath20 at @xmath21 , to @xmath22 at @xmath23 and @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "unfortunately , hst data are still at too low - resolution or are too scanty @xcite to allow a meaningful comparison with the present data .",
    "nonetheless , the result by ulmer @xcite , who measured with fos data a @xmath26 , on scales of @xmath27 km / s at @xmath28 , suggests that the trend persists at lower redshifts .",
    "a discussion of the clustering of the civ systems can be found in the paper by v.dodorico ( this conference ) .",
    "a correlation of the clustering amplitude with column density is observed also for civ systems . in the upper - right of fig .",
    "[ figclustew ] the tpcf derived for high and low column density civ metal systems is shown .",
    "an extrapolation of the increasing amplitude trend observed for the tpcf of the lyman-@xmath0 lines would easily intercept the corresponding estimates derived from the civ metal systems .",
    "the similarity between the shapes of the tpcf s of the lyman-@xmath0 and civ systems , when observed at comparable resolution @xcite , is also remarkable .",
    "fernandez - soto et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the clustering properties of the lyman-@xmath0 clouds on the basis of the corresponding civ absorptions , suggesting that civ may resolve better the small - scale velocity structure that can not be fully traced by lyman-@xmath0 lines . as a consequence , the estimates of the tpcf of the lyman-@xmath0 absorbers ,",
    "although the effects of the non - negligible width of the lines ( the `` line - blanketing '' ) are considered in our simulations , should be regarded as a lower limit to the real clustering amplitude .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to translate the properties of the civ absorbers in the corresponding ones of the lyman-@xmath0 absorbers , since observations show that the velocity structures of high and low - ionization species are often different . in any case , since the underestimation of the lyman-@xmath0 tpcf would be more severe at larger column densities , the trend of an increasing correlation with increasing column density appears to be real , from the lowest column densities up to those corresponding to the strongest metal systems .    if we add to this observation the following pieces of evidence :    1 .   at low redshift",
    "a considerable fraction of the lyman-@xmath0 lines has been observed to be associated with luminous galaxies and the local large - scale structure @xcite ; 2 .",
    "metallicities of the order @xmath29 , i.e. similar to the ones derived for the heavy elements absorptions originated in galactic halos , are observed for lyman-@xmath0 clouds with @xmath30 @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the volume density and cosmological evolution of the same @xmath31 clouds are similar to those of the damped systems @xcite ;    all together this suggests a physical association between the lyman-@xmath0 clouds with @xmath30 and the halos of protogalactic systems .",
    "the typical column density below which no clustering of the lyman-@xmath0 lines is observed ( @xmath32 ) corresponds to the position of the break in their column density distribution @xcite , which has been identified with the transition from a variety of systems in various stages of gravitational infall and collapse ( or even under - densities ) to gas associated with star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed clustering properties are qualitatively consistent with a scenario of gravitationally induced correlations .",
    "the dependence of the clustering amplitude on the column density arises naturally in models involving biasing for the formation of structures in the universe : objects associated with the stronger potential wells are expected to be more clustered and the hi column density is directly related to the depth of the well ( and to the associated mass ) .",
    "the trend of increasing correlation with decreasing redshift is also a strong prediction of any model of structure formation based on gravitational instability . on the contrary , theories of explosive structure formation",
    "@xcite expect a velocity correlation either unchanging or diminishing with time .    to be more quantitative an estimate of the masses of the clouds is needed .",
    "known the ionization field from the proximity effect @xcite and the sizes of the clouds from quasar pairs and gravitational lenses ( @xmath33 kpc ) @xcite , the observed column densities can be transformed in masses with a photoionization code @xcite .",
    "then , we can apply a recipe connecting a given model of universe , the spectrum of the initial fluctuations , to the clustering of the mass @xcite and , finally , convolve it with the effects of the non - negligible size of the absorbing structures and their peculiar velocities @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the results for two standard cosmological models , a cdm normalized to the abundance of clusters and a tilted cdm , are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath35 km / s .",
    "a typical way of looking for non - random fluctuations of the line density on large scales is the search for voids .",
    "voids in the lyman-@xmath0 forest provide a test for models of the large - scale structure in the universe and of the homogeneity of the uv ionizing flux .",
    "previous searches for megaparsec - sized voids have produced a few claims @xcite , but uncertainties in the line statistics strongly influence the probability estimate @xcite .",
    "high resolution data , less affected by blending effects , are ideal also for the study of voids .",
    "detections of voids in individual cases are interesting but a more general approach , assessing more quantitatively how common is the phenomenon and avoiding the pitfalls of `` a posteriori statistics '' , is preferable .",
    "we have adopted the following procedure : for each of the objects in the extended sample and for lines with @xmath36 we have estimated through montecarlo simulations the void size @xmath37 ( in comoving coordinates ) for which the probability to find at least one void @xmath38 is @xmath39",
    ". then we have searched each spectrum for voids of dimensions equal or larger than @xmath37 . in 3 out of the 9 cases for which the density of lines and the absence of spectral gaps allow a meaningful analysis ,",
    "at least one void was detected ( two voids for @xmath40 ) .",
    "the binomial probability corresponding to such occurrences is @xmath41 .    from the spectra it is apparent that the regions corresponding to the voids are not completely devoid of lines : weak absorptions are observed within the voids .",
    "this agrees with low - redshift observations @xcite that have shown that in the local universe voids are not entirely devoid of matter .",
    "even if underdense regions are statistically significant in our sample , the filling factor is rather low : the voids cover only about @xmath42% of the available line - of - sight path - length , confirming previous results @xcite .",
    "voids are just an extreme case of spectral regions showing an under - density of lines .",
    "various theoretical reasons prompt to tackle the issue of over- and under - densities of lines from a more general point of view : the typical signature of a `` proximity effect '' due to a foreground quasar is a lack of weak lines in the lyman forest , rather than lack of lines in general @xcite ; the relative filling factor of under - densities and over - densities may provide a constraint on the theories of structure formation .",
    "we have analysed the spectra of the extended sample with a counts - in - cells technique searching for over- and under - densities of lines with @xmath43 on scales from 10 to 80 mpc and comparing the observed counts with montecarlo simulations in order to assess the significance of the deviations . on smaller scales",
    "the shot noise is too large , on larger scales the `` integral constraint '' , forcing the simulated number of lines to be equal to the observed one , prevents from the possibility of detecting any deviation .",
    "the threshold to define significant a deviation ( for example in excess ) in a given spectral interval has been set in a way that at a given scale for a given quasar there is a @xmath39 probability of observing at least one deviation of this type on the whole spectrum for a locally poissonian distribution",
    ".    5 qsos out of 15 show at least one over - density in their spectrum at 10 mpc scales , corresponding to a binomial probability of @xmath44 of being drawn from a poissonian distribution of lines .",
    "4 qsos show at least one over - density of lines at 20 and 30 mpc scales , corresponding to a binomial probability of @xmath45 . at",
    "larger scales the number of significant over - densities decreases .",
    "none is observed at 80 mpc .",
    "the existence of a roughly equal number of over and under - densities on scales @xmath46 mpc is easily understandable in terms of the linear theory of the evolution of the perturbations , that is a plausible approximation at such relatively high redshifts : gravity has not yet had time to give a significant skewness to the ( under)over - density distribution . besides , almost any hierarchical clustering scenario would expect that at @xmath47 gravity has not yet had enough time to transfer power on 80 mpc scales and give origin to significant over or under - densities ."
