    "agns are mostly found in x - ray surveys where they represent the majority of the detected population .",
    "however , some agns are missed even in the deepest x - ray observations , e.g. the  deep surveys , cdfn  @xcite and cdfs  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a large population of agns that is still undetected , even in the deepest x - ray surveys , is suggested by the unresolved x - ray background  @xcite and by the discovery of agns not detected at x - ray energies , but identified at radio and infrared wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of agns are necessary to make a census of agns and to fully characterize them .    current facilities and projects permit to study large agn samples throughout the entire wavelength spectrum , from radio wavelengths to x - ray energies .",
    "several wide and deep multi - wavelength surveys are currently being performed providing enough area , coverage and sensitivity to sample the multi - wavelength properties of agns .",
    "a difficult task that multi - wavelength surveys need to face is the identification of agn .",
    "agns usually represent only a small fraction of sources compared to the population detected at optical and ir wavelengths and their properties can be elusive .",
    "obscured agns can be elusive because their optical emission resembles that of normal galaxies and therefore they can not be identified by the color - selection techniques used for qsos ( e.g. schmidt & green 1983 ) , or because their spectra do not show any agn signature .",
    "their ir emission can be dominated by pah features , typical of star - forming galaxies , instead of continuum emission from hot dust .",
    "radio observations reveal the radio - loud population of obscured agns ( e.g. radio galaxies ) , but this comprises only a small fraction , @xmath1110% , of the total agn population .",
    "a hard x - ray selection fails to detect the luminous narrow - line agns in the numbers predicted by some models of the cxrb .    in order to obtain a complete picture of the agn population ,",
    "selection biases need to be taken into account .",
    "the fraction of agns missed in observations in narrow energy windows , e.g. x - rays , infrared , or optical , is not well known .",
    "moreover , the dispersion in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all kind of agns needs to be well characterized to evaluate which and what fraction of agns are missed in a wavelength window and detected in another because of the unmatched depths of the observations at different wavelengths .",
    "the seds are also important for evolutionary models  @xcite , and to estimate the contribution of accretion to the cosmic backgrounds .    in this work ,",
    "we characterize the seds of a sample of agns selected in the hard x - rays and investigate how they vary as a function of x - ray absorption , luminosity , redshift , and host galaxy contribution .",
    "a selection in the hard x - rays minimizes the bias against absorbed agns compared to samples selected at soft or broad - band x - ray energies .",
    "our analysis is based on the sources detected by  in a 1  region of the xmm - newton medium deep survey  ( xmds ; * ? ? ?",

    "we introduce a new nomenclature for the broad - band sed classification : agn1 , agn2 , and sf .",
    "the term agn1 refers to an sed that is fitted by a type 1 agn template , the term agn2 refers to an sed that is fitted by a type 2 agns or composite template , and the term sf , which stands for star - forming , refers to an sed that is fitted by a star - forming galaxy template , like spirals and starburst galaxies .",
    "although the templates are classified on the basis of their optical spectral properties , we do not expect a perfect match between the sed classification and the properties of the optical spectra .",
    "the sed classification is more indicative of the main emitting components dominating at optical and ir wavelengths rather than of their optical spectra .",

    "however , the inclusion of mid - ir data in photometric redshift techniques can degrade the photometric redshift estimates because the templates represent only a limited range of optical / ir ratios .",

    "most of the cases there are three solutions per source ( the best and two secondary solutions ) , but in some cases , only one solution ( or one minimum in the @xmath24 distribution ) , is found within the defined absolute magnitude limits , thus for each source there might be from one to three solutions .",

    "six sources ( xmds seq : 139 , 199 , 233 , 403 , 840 , 1219 ) have been observed only in the optical or in the ir and have less than six data points in total . because of the limited wavelength coverage",

    "some models predict smaller dust covering factors , or lower mid - ir over x - ray luminosity ratios , in more luminous sources .",

    "the agn2s ( panel d ) show a clear change in the optical - ir sed as the x - ray luminosity increases , with the overall sed becoming redder .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this change is an increasingly contribution from hot dust continuum emission associated with the agn , e.g the putative torus , or less contribution from the host galaxy . in the lowest luminosity group , the host galaxy still dominates , but at large luminosities its emission is significantly lower than that of the agn .",
    "it is difficult to characterize the host galaxy emission in the mid - ir because it can change dramatically for an elliptical or a late spiral or a starburst galaxy . in all cases the host galaxy light peaks in the near - ir , @xmath111 - 2  @xmath23 m , where the agn light has a minimum  @xcite . at longer wavelengths the host galaxy emission can decrease or increase , according to the galaxy type , and the agn contribution increases .",
    "thus , the total spectrum goes from blue if the host dominates to flat if the two contributions are similar to red when the agn dominates .",

    "the decrease in mid - ir luminosity relative to the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity with increasing x - ray luminosities discussed in section  [ lmir_lx_ratio ] is also visible here .",
    "this result is even more remarkable considering that the host galaxy contributes to the mid - ir luminosity .",
    "the decreasing mid - ir luminosity compared to the absorption corrected x - ray luminosity observed in the most luminous agn2s and in the sfs is equivalent to the low mid - ir over x - ray ratios found at high x - ray energies in sfs discussed in section  [ lmir_lx_ratio ] and shown in figures  [ lmirlxc_lxc ] and  [ lmirlxc_lxc_lit ] . from the analysis in the previous section , we concluded that the deficiency of mid - ir light is not dependent on the agn x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , when the agn x - ray luminosity is low the host galaxy might be luminous enough to compensate the mid - ir deficiency , preventing low mid - ir over x - ray ratios to be observable in less luminous agns .",
    "assuming that a molecular torus surrounds the nuclear source , the deficiency of mid - ir light relative to the x - ray luminosity observed in sfs and some agn2s can be explained by lack of hot dust , larger optical depths , or large angles of the line of sight from the torus axis  @xcite .",

    "this behaviour suggests that the x - ray luminosity might be underestimated by a factor of 40 , a hypothesis that would indicate that the source is compton - thick and the observed x - ray emission is only scattered light .",

    "we estimate the luminosity and expected flux in the energy range 20 - 100 kev , where integral is sensitive , to determine whether integral will be able to detect it . assuming that the absorption - corrected rest - frame 0.510  kev luminosity is 40 times higher , the derived luminosity is @xmath135=2.9@xmath1910@xmath136 , which corresponds to an absorption corrected flux @xmath137 2s , and an observed flux @xmath138 2s assuming a column density of 10@xmath139  2 .",
    "so far , integral has not detected agns at these flux levels  @xcite , however the long xmm - lss exposure might be able to reveal the heavily obscured agns in source xmds seq 842 ( aka arp 54 ) .",
    "in this work , we have characterized the seds of a hard x - ray selected sample of agns . as previously found  ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the multi - wavelength seds of x - ray selected agns show a wide variety of properties .",
    "we divide the seds in three broad classes , agn1 , agn2 , and sf .",
    "the fraction of agns that fall into the various sed classes likely depends on the sample selection , i.e. spectral window and flux limit .",
    "for example , an optically selected sample will have a larger fraction of agn1s and an ir - selected sample will be biased against agns in the sf class . a different x - ray flux limit or a selection in a different x - ray band",
    "can also alter the fraction of sources in the various classes .",
    "for example , @xcite finds 39% agn1s , 23% agn2s and 38% sfs in a sample of agns with broad x - ray fluxes @xmath1402s .",
    "if the classification of the sources fitted with a mrk 231 template in  @xcite is modified from agn1 to agn2 as assumed here , the fractions become 15% of agn1s , 42% of agn2s , and 36% of sfs .",
    "the agn1 fraction is lower than ours ( 15 @xmath106 33% ) , the fraction of agn2s is slightly lower than ours ( 42 @xmath106 50% ) and the fraction of sfs is twice ours ( 36 @xmath106 17% ) .",
    "these differences are likely due to our higher x - ray flux limit and requirement of detection in the hard x - ray band ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "there is indeed an indication for the fraction of agn1s to decrease and the fraction of sfs to increase at fainter x - ray fluxes ( see paper ii for a more detailed analysis ) .",
    "the trend of having less agn1s and more sfs at lower x - ray flux levels has to be confirmed and better quantified using similarly selected samples with analogous classification covering a broad range of fluxes .",
    "although hard x - ray samples , as the one used here , provide the least biased agn samples , some agn , e.g. compton - thick agns are still missed . however , we do not expect the seds of compton - thick agns to fall in a separate class .",
    "known compton - thick agns , both in the local universe and at high redshifts , show seds that are consistent with the agn2 ( e.g. mrk 231 , ngc 1068 ) and sf classes ( e.g. ngc 4945 , ngc 6240 ) . from the sed analysis of a sample of x - ray selected compton - thick agns ,  @xcite estimates that 60% of compton - thick agns fall in the sf class , and 40% in the agn2 class .",
    "thus , through sed fitting we can identify a large fraction of agns , even compton - thick agns .",
    "the sed fitting technique provides an efficient agn identification tool .",
    "the main advantage is that it is based on data that can be more easily obtained than x - ray data and spectroscopic data .",
    "moreover , this technique identifies the same or an even higher fraction of agns than the spectroscopic classification .",
    "based on the sample of 49 spectroscopically identified xmds sources , we estimate that the sed fitting technique is able to identify agn activity in 8 out of 11 ( 73% ) agns that are spectroscopically classified as star - forming galaxies , in 7 out of 12 ( 58% ) agns that are spectroscopically classified as type 2 agns , and in 25 out of 26 ( 96% ) agns that are spectroscopically classified as type 1 agns .",
    "overall , we identify agn activity in 40 out of 49 ( 82% ) hard x - ray selected agns with available spectroscopic data and in 83% ( 50% of agn2s and 33% of agn1s ) in the entire x - ray sample , while optical spectroscopy reveals an agn in 38 sources ( 78% ) .",
    "the sed fitting technique can be applied to sources that are too faint at optical wavelengths for optical spectroscopic observations , or with emission lines that are diluted by the host galaxy light or affected by obscuration  @xcite , and to sources in the redshift desert .",
    "there is evidence that these source might represent a significant fraction of agn samples .",
    "thus , sed fitting represents a powerful and efficient tool to identify agn activity in samples for which optical spectroscopic observations are unavailable or impossible to perform .",
    "however , this technique has also some limitations .",
    "almost half of type 2 agns and a third of star - forming galaxy - like agns might still be missed and not identified as agns . moreover ,",
    "the sed classification can be misled by the more dominant host - galaxy light at optical - near - infrared wavelengths as in many seyfert 1 galaxies and thus classify a type 1 agn as agn2 or sf .",
    "these limitations might be overcome if well sampled multi - wavelength seds of large agn samples in various classes with spectroscopic data become available . with such data",
    "the agn templates can be improved and expanded and the sed fitting technique can be refined .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the nature of the agn that are not identified by the sed technique and by optical spectroscopy .",
    "there are several examples of agns in the literature whose optical spectra or broad - band seds resemble those of normal galaxies and are , therefore , not identified as agns unless probed by x - ray or radio data .",
    "we refer to these sources as elusive agns  @xcite .",
    "these sources belong to the sf class and might have many properties in common with known categories of elusive agns found in the literature , e.g the optically dull discovered in optical samples  @xcite , the x - ray bright optically normal galaxies discovered in x - ray samples  ( xbongs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the type 3 qsos found in ir - selected samples  @xcite .",
    "the rich taxonomy of these categories reflects mostly the wavelengths at which they were discovered , while the scenarios proposed to explain their nature are similar .",
    "the properties of these elusive agns are usually explained by two scenarios : 1 ) heavy obscuration by dust with a large covering factor  @xcite , and/or 2 ) a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf )  @xcite .",
    "large dust covering factors obscure the optical emission from the inner regions , thus no narrow emission lines are observed .",
    "the inefficient accretion explains the lack of optical and ultraviolet radiation from the accretion disk and of emission lines from the broad and narrow line regions .",
    "the existence of unabsorbed xbongs  @xcite in the x - rays disfavors the former hypothesis , although it is likely that both scenarios might be valid . based on ir and sub - millimetre observations of some of these elusive agns  @xcite",
    ", it has been proposed that the obscuring dust is associated with a starburst and that these agns might be in an early phase of their growth .",
    "these objects might have already formed the bulk of their stellar mass , but the central bh has not fully grown and they are accreting at a low rate  @xcite . this last scenario combines the two described above . in summary , all these classes of agns are either explained by heavy absorption associated with dust with a large covering factor and/or by an inefficiently accreting black hole .",
    "we examine in more detail the properties of 3 sfs for which spectroscopic data are also available and fail in identifying the agn , xmds seq 439 , 487 , and 842 .",
    "our goal is to find out what they have in common that might explain their elusiveness and whether we can identify their agn activity by other means in absence of x - ray data .",
    "all three sources are fitted with spiral templates , however xmds seq 487 shows a small excess of emission in the near - ir with respect to the template .",
    "such an excess is likely due to agn - heated hot dust .",
    "indeed , a fit with an agn1 template is one of its secondary solutions .",
    "all three sources are absorbed in the x - rays ( @xmath1412@xmath1910@xmath17 2 ) and their x - ray luminosities cover a broad range , from 10@xmath142  to 10@xmath143 .",
    "the mir - to - radio luminosity ratios of two sources are consistent with those observed in radio - quiet agns and normal galaxies , however xmds seq 439 shows a lower than expected ratio ( @xmath1813.1 , compared to the expected 14.4 ; see figure  [ lrad_lmir ] ) .",
    "this low ratio indicates radio emission in excess , and thus strongly suggests agn activity . in summary , by using the mir - to - radio luminosity ratio and the secondary solutions of the sed fits , we can identify agn activity in 2 of these 3 sources .",
    "the agn nature of the third source , xmds seq 842 , is actually not confirmed ( see sections  [ sfg ] and  [ radio ] ) .",
    "overall , we do not find any evidence for inefficient accretion in sfs . indeed",
    "they can be intrinsically powerful x - ray sources and their x - ray / radio luminosity ratios satisfy the same correlations observed for agn1s and agn2s .",
    "the results from this study on these sources favor obscuration as the cause of the observed low mid - ir / x - ray luminosity ratios and elusive seds .",
    "however , an analysis of a larger sample with a broad range of luminosities and a rich multi - wavelength data set and , especially , more discriminating model predictions for various dust distributions and orientations , linked with the x - ray properties , are necessary to investigate whether our results are simply consistent with an orientation effect , or indicate higher dust covering factors or larger dust inner radii .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background is still unresolved at high energies ( @xmath1610 kev ) .",
    "the most recent background synthesis models predict that the missing population is made of sources at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath711 ) , with hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath1441.4 ) , and moderate luminosities ( @xmath1110@xmath136 )  @xcite .",

    "we propose the use of the radio luminosity to identify heavily obscured agns by estimating the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity in radio - quiet agns and by comparing the estimated flux with the observed x - ray flux . * * agn identification through sed fitting * the sed fitting technique presented here succeeds in identifying signatures in 83% of the objects in the hard x - ray sample .",
    "the remaining 17@xmath6% of agns are fitted with star - forming galaxy templates ( sf class ) .",
    "a comparison with the spectroscopic classification available for a small sub - sample indicates that the agn1 class is 100% reliable and 62% complete .",
    "the agn2 class is 29% reliable and 58% complete , and the sf class is 33% reliable and 27% complete .",
    "the sed and the spectroscopic classification agree in 53% of the cases .",
    "* * the nature of elusive agns * agns in the sf class are elusive agns at optical and ir wavelengths , similarly to optically dull agns , xbongs , and type 3 qsos .",
    "the properties of these sources can be simply explained by large obscuration in the mid - ir , however it is not clear whether the large obscuration is an effect of orientation or whether it implies larger covering factors and/or dust at larger distance from the nucleus .",
    "we do not find any evidence for inefficient accretion in these sources as they can be powerful x - ray sources .",
    "* * the missing agn population * we investigated whether the agns still missing from x - ray surveys and responsible for the bulk of the cxrb at high energies ( 1030  kev ) can be detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "the expected radio flux , derived assuming an x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath136  and the relationship shown in figure  [ lrad_lx ] , and @xmath5=1 is @xmath11 2.2  @xmath23jy .",
    "this flux density is lower than the limits reached by the deepest current radio surveys .",
    "thus , they will still be missing even in radio surveys .",
    "the sed analysis of the agn sample presented here indicates the existence of a large fraction of agns that would remain unidentified in optical and/or ir - selected samples ( sfs ) .",
    "these elusive agns show a broad range of luminosities and they are mostly x - ray absorbed .",
    "the evolution of this population needs to be constrained and taken into account in all evolutionary models .",
    "in backward evolutionary models , where seds are associated with different types of sources  @xcite , the inclusion of agns with sf - like sed will greatly affect the estimated contribution of agns at all wavelengths , especially in the mid - ir where agn - dominated seds are much redder than sf seds .",
    "the identification of these objects would be important in estimating the contribution of accretion energy to the mid - ir background and source counts  @xcite .",
