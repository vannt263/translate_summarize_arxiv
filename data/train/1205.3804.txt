    "the @xmath0-invariance of the maxwell equation was discovered by cunningham and bateman a century ago .",
    "however in order to quantize the maxwell field and due to gauge freedom , a gauge fixing condition is necessary .",
    "the lorenz gauge is usually used , which breaks the @xmath0 invariance .",
    "nonetheless since such a symmetry mights apear to lack physical meaning , its breaking does not bother many people @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the benefits of keeping this fundamental symmetry when quantizing the maxwell field in conformally flat spaces ( cfs ) .",
    "the starting point is the following .",
    "a classical @xmath0-invariant field can not , at least locally , distinguish between two cfss @xcite .",
    "so why not maintain the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a cfs ?",
    "doing so , a free field living in a cfs might behave like in a flat space and the corresponding wightman two - point functions can be related to their minkowskian counterparts .",
    "the work @xcite confirms this assertion in the special case of maxwell field in de sitter space .",
    "indeed , a new and simple two - point wightman function @xmath1 was found and which has the same physical ( gauge independent ) content as the two - point function of allen and jacobson @xcite .",
    "this is because the faraday propagator @xmath2 is the same .",
    "the present work extends to general cfss and clarify the quantum structure of the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "we use dirac s six - cone formalism and realize all cfss as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six - dimensional lorentzian space .",
    "the introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the gubta - bleuler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with gauge freedom of the maxwell field .",
    "another important ingredient is the use of a well - suited coordinate system .",
    "this allows to @xmath0-invariant cfs formulas to get a minkowskian form .",
    "the main result is a set of wightman two - point functions for maxwell and auxiliary fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ geom ] sets the coordinates systems and the geometrical construction of cfss .",
    "[ fields ] defines the fields and gives their dynamical equations . in sec .",
    "[ quantum - field ] , the dynamical system is solved , the quantum field is explicitly constructed and the two - point functions are written down .",
    "some technical details are given in appdx .",
    "[ details ] .",
    "the infinitesimal @xmath0 action on the fields @xmath3 is expanded in appdx .",
    "[ action ] and their @xmath0-invariant scalar product is given in appdx .",
    "the six - dimensional lorentzian space @xmath4 is provided with the natural orthogonal coordinates @xmath5 and equipped with the metric @xmath6 .",
    "quantities related to @xmath4 and its null cone @xmath7 are labeled with a tilde .",
    "we define a second coordinate system @xmath8 , @xmath9 where the four components @xmath10 is the so - called polyspherical coordinate system @xcite and @xmath11 . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath12 which means that the component @xmath13 carries alone the homogeneity of the @xmath14 s .",
    "using the system @xmath15 , the null cone reads @xmath16 a five - dimensional surface in @xmath4 is defined through @xmath17 where the real and smooth function @xmath18 depends only on @xmath10 and @xmath19 and is then homogeneous of degree @xmath20 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a four - dimensional space @xmath23 where the index @xmath24 in @xmath25 refers to @xmath26 ) .",
    "regarding to its metric inherited from @xmath27 , precisely @xmath28 @xmath25 turns out to be a cfs .",
    "a smooth move of the surface @xmath29 , which corresponds to changing the function @xmath30 , amounts to perform a weyl rescaling .",
    "this locally relates all cfss and permits to go from one to another .",
    "note that for @xmath31 , @xmath25 reduces to minkowski space @xmath32 and accordingly the four components system @xmath10 yields the usual cartesian system .",
    "the gradients @xmath33 are extensivelly used in this article .",
    "the function @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath13 and thus @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath30 , including its @xmath19 dependence has to be done in such a way to ensure the invariance ( in @xmath4 ) of the surface @xmath22 under the action of the isometry group associated to the desired @xmath25 four - dimensional space . since the @xmath4 null - cone is @xmath0-invariant , the resulting @xmath25 will be invariant under its isometry group .",
    "let us consider an example : @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "the associated surface @xmath22 and thus the corresponding @xmath25 are left invariant under the action of de sitter group @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath25 is a de sitter space .",
    "in this section , we explain how to obtain the @xmath0-invariant maxwell field in @xmath25 from a six - dimensional one - form . following dirac @xcite",
    ", we consider a one - form @xmath37 defined in @xmath4 homogeneous of degree @xmath38 and which decomposes on the @xmath39 basis as @xmath40 the components @xmath41 are homogeneous of degree @xmath42 and obey to the equation @xmath43 this equation is naturally invariant under the @xmath0 action since this group has a linear action when acting in @xmath4 .",
    "we then decompose the one - form @xmath37 on the basis @xmath44 corresponding to the system @xmath45 ( [ coord+muc ] ) , with a slight but capital modification on the @xmath46 component .",
    "there are two ways , the first decomposition reads @xmath47 the second is given by @xmath48 now , identifying ( [ eq-1 ] ) with ( [ eq-2 ] ) , one obtains the relation between the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 through @xmath51 all the fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are by construction homogeneous of degree @xmath54 . as a consequence , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "this amounts to project the fields @xmath52 on @xmath57 and @xmath53 on @xmath58 . then projecting the fields on the null cone @xmath21 yields @xmath59 thus @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively @xmath25 and minkowski fields .",
    "though in a slightly different maner , this relation was obtained in @xcite in the particular case of de sitter space and was called the `` extended weyl transformation '' .",
    "the fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 are auxiliary fields and the field @xmath64 is , up to the condition @xmath65 the maxwell field .",
    "this will become clear here after .",
    "let us now turn to the dynamical equations .",
    "our strategy is to transport minkowskian @xmath0-invariant equations to get @xmath0-invariant equations in the @xmath25 space .",
    "the first step is thus to write down the minkowskian equations which are obtained using the equation ( [ equation - a ] ) and the relation ( [ a(a)-m ] ) .",
    "this system reads @xmath66 the corresponding system in @xmath25 is obtained using ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) , @xmath67 where all contractions are performed using @xmath68 even though we are in the curved space @xmath25 .",
    "the field @xmath69 obeying to the system above is not yet the maxwell one .",
    "nevertheless , the constraint @xmath70 simplifies the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) and leads to @xmath71 despite their minkowskian form , these equations are the maxwell equation and a conformal gauge condition on any conformally flat space . this is due to the use of the polyspherical coordinate system ( [ coord+muc ] ) , which makes apparent the flatness feature of the @xmath25 spaces .",
    "the constraint @xmath72 reduces the extended weyl transformation ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) into the identity @xmath73 recovering the ordinary vanishing conformal weight of the maxwell field @xmath69 . after some algebra , the covariant form of ( [ maxwellh1 ] ) takes the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 . the first line ( resp .",
    "the second one ) is the covariant maxwell ( resp .",
    "the eastwood - singer gauge @xcite ) equation in an arbitrary @xmath25 space .",
    "this conformal gauge was first derived by bayen and flato in minkowski space @xcite .",
    "its extension to curved spaces ( even cfss ) is not trivial and can be performed using adapted tools like the weyl - gauging technique @xcite or the weyl - to - riemann method @xcite .",
    "note that the system ( [ system - covariant ] ) is valid only if @xmath76 ( an @xmath0-invariant constraint ) .",
    "but the latter has to be fixed at the end of the quantization process , not at the begining .",
    "indeed , the auxiliary field @xmath77 acts as a faddeev popov ghost field and its retention during the quantization process is necessary .",
    "the constraint @xmath76 will be applied on the quantum space to select an invariant subspace of physical states and the wightman functions thus include the whole big space .",
    "this is related to the undecomposable group representation ( see appendix [ action ] ) .",
    "we now apply the gupta - bleuler quantization scheme @xcite .",
    "this can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have seen that @xmath78 is interpreted as the maxwell field in the eastwood - singer gauge ( [ system - covariant ] ) on the space @xmath79 when the constraint @xmath80 is applied .",
    "the problem is that pure gauge solutions ( @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath80 ) are orthogonal to all the solutions including themselves . as a consequence ,",
    "the space of solutions is degenerate and no wightman functions can be constructed . to fix this problem , we consider the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) , instead of ( [ system - covariant ] ) , for which @xmath83 and thus a causal reproducing kernel can be found .",
    "this means that for quantum fields @xmath84 acting on some hilbert ( or krein ) space @xmath85 , we can not impose the operator equation @xmath86 .",
    "instead , we define the subspace of physical states @xmath87 which cancels the action of @xmath88 . then the maxwell equation and the eastwood - singer gauge hold in the mean on the space @xmath89 .",
    "the task seems complicated at first sight , but thanks to the correspondence ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) we only need to solve the minkowskian system ( [ syst1 m ] ) , which is already done in @xcite .",
    "indeed , using the weyl equivalence between cfss , the whole structure of an @xmath90-covariant free field theory can be transported from minkowski to another cfs . in the following ,",
    "we solve the dynamical equations , obtain the modes , determine the quantum field , the subspace of physical states and finally compute the two - point functions .      the solutions of the minkowskian system ( [ syst1 m ] ) can be obtained from @xcite and read @xmath91 where @xmath92 are polarization vectors whose components are given by @xmath93 and verifying @xmath94 with respect to the scalar product ( [ scalarps - a ] ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath95 relates the fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( [ matrix - s ] ) .",
    "the scalar modes @xmath98 are solutions of the minkowskian @xmath0-invariant ( or massless ) sclalar field equation @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the usual hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath102 is chosen in order to get @xmath103 with respect to the klein - gordon scalar product . as a consequence , the solutions ( [ modes - a ] ) are normalized with respect to ( [ scalarps - a ] )",
    ", @xmath104 thus the general solution of the system ( [ syst1 m ] ) reads @xmath105 where @xmath106 are real constants .",
    "let us now turn to the modes of the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) .",
    "they are obtained thanks to the extended weyl transformation ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) applied on the minkowskian modes ( [ modes - a ] ) @xmath107 these modes are normalized like ( [ norm ] ) but according to the scalar product ( [ scalarps - a - k ] ) .",
    "the general solution on @xmath79 reads @xmath108 where the @xmath109 are some real constants .",
    "note that when @xmath110 the solutions ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) solve the maxwell equation in the eastwood - singer gauge .",
    "we can now define the quantum fields and construct the fock spaces as usual .",
    "the quantum fields corresponding to ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) are respectively defined through @xmath111 @xmath112 where the operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 are respectively the annihilators and creators of the modes ( [ modes - a ] ) in @xmath32 and the modes ( [ modes - a - k ] ) in @xmath25 .",
    "the use of the same annihilators and creators for all cfss is highly important for our purpose .",
    "indeed , this allows to define the the same vaccuum state @xmath115 through @xmath116 for any annihilator .",
    "the one - particle states are built by applying the creators on the vacuum state @xmath117 and the multiple particle states of the fock spaces are constructed as usual .",
    "moreover , the annihilation and creation operators obey to the following algebra @xmath118 =    [   \\hat a_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}m ( \\alpha)}^{\\dag } , \\hat a_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}'m ' ( \\beta)}^{\\dag } ] = 0 \\\\ & [   \\hat a_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}m ( \\alpha ) } , \\hat a_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}'m ' ( \\beta)}^{\\dag } ]   = -\\tilde \\eta_{{\\scriptscriptstyle \\alpha}\\beta } \\delta_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}l ' } \\delta_{{\\scriptscriptstyle m}m'}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the subset of physical states in both spaces is determined thanks to the classical physical solutions ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) verifying ( [ a+=0 ] ) . in quantum language , @xmath119 is a physical state iff @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the annihilator part of @xmath122 .",
    "this implies the equality @xmath123 for any physical states @xmath119 and @xmath124 .",
    "also , the subspace of physical states is the same in all cfss , which allows to transport physical quantities from minkowski space into the @xmath25 space . as a consequence , one obtains @xmath125 in @xmath25 and the corresponding minkowskian system in @xmath32 .",
    "the quantum fields fulfill the maxwell equation together with the eastwood - singer gauge in the mean on the physical states .",
    "we show in this part how to get the wightman two - point functions on @xmath25 from their minkowskian counterparts .",
    "the wightman functions related to the minkowskian fields @xmath126 are defined through @xmath127 their expressions are given in @xcite and read @xmath128 where @xmath129 with @xmath130 stands for the wightman two - point function related to the minkowskian massless scalar field .",
    "the wightman two - point functions related to the field @xmath131 are given by @xmath132 now , using ( [ modes - a - k ] ) , ( [ maxwelds2ptdef ] ) and ( [ wightman - k ] ) , allows to write the following capital formula @xmath133 where the @xmath134 terms read @xmath135 the wightman two - point functions ( [ dk - dm ] ) read @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "+ to end this paper , let us consider an important particular case , that corresponding to de sitter space .",
    "this case is obtained by specifying @xmath141 where @xmath142 is related to the de sitterian ricci scalar through @xmath143 .",
    "the gradients ( [ upsilon ] ) read @xmath144 in this case we obtain simple expressions for the two - point functions related to the fields @xmath145 on de sitter space .",
    "the three more relevant yield @xmath146 where we have used ( de sitter is a maximally symmetric space ) the standard unit tangent vectors @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the parallel propagator along the geodesic @xmath149 and the usual function @xmath150 of the geodesic distance @xmath151 relating @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "see @xcite for a more precise statement .",
    "note that the two - point function @xmath155 has the same physical content with the allen and jacobson two - point function @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-covariant quantization of the maxwell field in an arbitrary conformally flat space was presented . following dirac s six - cone formalism , all conformally flat spaces @xmath25",
    "are realized as intersections of the null cone and a given surface @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum field was explicitly constructed using the gupta - bleuler canonical quantization scheme and the wightman two - point functions were given .",
    "the price to pay for this simplicity and the maintaining of the @xmath0 invariance during the whole quantization process was the introduction of two auxiliary fields @xmath156 and @xmath77 .",
    "as a consequence , the maxwell field @xmath69 does not propagate `` alone '' but together with its two auxiliary fields .",
    "the propagation must use all the wightman functions ( [ d - x - k - relevent ] ) and not only the `` purely '' maxwell one @xmath157 .",
    "nonetheless , in a recent work @xcite , we have used the functions ( [ d - ds ] ) to propagate the maxwell field generated by two charges of opposite sign placed at the two poles of a de sitter space .",
    "the calculations showed that only @xmath157 is involved , which trivialize the problem .",
    "one can consider to use the two - point functions ( [ d - x - k - relevent ] ) to propagate the electromagnetic field for some charge distribution given in other cfss , like flrw spaces for instance .",
    "one concludes that is much worth to maintain the @xmath0 symmetry during the whole quantization process when dealing with maxwell field in a conformally flat space .",
    "the problem then goes back to minkowski and the calculations become much easier .",
    "in fact , the classical and quantum structures of the free maxwell field are locally the same in all conformally flat spaces .",
    "the remained question is to know if this is true for other free fields and how to deal with @xmath0-invariant interactions ?",
    "i would like to thank m. novello , j. renaud and e. huguet for illuminating discussions and the cnpq for financial support .",
    "considering ( [ field - a ] ) and ( [ eq-1 ] ) , expressing the basis @xmath159 in terms of @xmath44 and then identifying both sides , one obtains the expression of @xmath160 in terms of @xmath161 .",
