    "one motivation for the study of @xmath5 photoproduction is to investigate the role of the @xmath6 meson ( also called the @xmath7 ) through @xmath8-channel exchange .",
    "the @xmath7 is expected to be in the same scalar meson nonet as the @xmath9 meson ( also called the @xmath10 ) .",
    "neither of these mesons have been directly observed because of their large widths , which are nearly as big as their respective masses .",
    "such a large width is expected for scalar mesons , which have quantum numbers @xmath11 . in many quark models , there is virtually no angular momentum barrier to prevent these mesons from falling apart into two mesons , such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 . because the @xmath10 and @xmath7 mesons can not be observed directly , indirect production mechanisms provide better evidence of their existence .",
    "the @xmath10 meson is rather well established @xcite as a @xmath14 resonance , which is an important component of models of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15-@xmath15 ) interaction such as the bonn potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 meson , however , is less easily established due to its strange quark content .",
    "data for hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath16-@xmath15 ) interactions are sparse and hence models have a range of parameter space that may or may not include @xmath7 exchange .",
    "perhaps the best current evidence for the @xmath7 is from the decay angular distributions of the @xmath17-meson into @xmath18 final states @xcite .",
    "here , in photoproduction of the @xmath19 , the @xmath20 enters into the @xmath8-channel exchange diagrams @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 can not contribute to kaon photoproduction because the photon can not couple to the @xmath21-@xmath7 vertex due to g - parity conservation .",
    "theoretical calculations have been done @xcite showing the effect of the @xmath7 on photoproduction of @xmath19 and @xmath22 final states .",
    "several years ago , two reports of @xmath22 photoproduction were published @xcite but only preliminary results on @xmath19 were available @xcite .",
    "we present the first results of @xmath3 and @xmath23 photoproduction with high statistics .",
    "together , the @xmath19 and @xmath22 photoproduction results could put significant constraints on the role of the @xmath7 meson in @xmath8-channel exchange . here , for the first time , we make the ratio of total cross sections for the reactions @xmath24 and @xmath25 and compare with the same ratio calculated from a theoretical model for large and small contributions from @xmath7 exchange .",
    "other evidence for the @xmath7 comes from recently published data on the linear beam asymmetry in photoproduction of the @xmath26 reaction @xcite which shows a significant positive value at forward @xmath5 angles that is the signature of @xmath7 exchange @xcite .",
    "a secondary motivation for this study is to understand if theoretical models using regge trajectories plus known baryon resonances can explain the @xmath19 photoproduction data . if not , then there may be higher - mass baryon resonances that could couple strongly to @xmath27 decay . in a classic paper on the quark model , capstick and roberts calculated @xcite many nucleon resonances that were predicted , but not observed in existing partial wave analyses of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "they also observed that some of the higher - mass resonances may couple weakly to pion decay channels and more strongly to @xmath28 and @xmath27 decays .",
    "indeed , studies of @xmath28 photoproduction @xcite have shown that hadronic model calculations can not explain the data without the addition of a new nucleon resonance near 1.9 gev .",
    "we can look for other \" missing resonance states at higher mass , such as those identified in the bonn - gatchina analysis @xcite largely through precise hyperon photoproduction data from clas , by comparing @xmath5 photoproduction data to model calculations .",
    "this paper is organized into the following sections .",
    "first , the experiment is described .",
    "next , the data analysis is presented in some detail .",
    "then we compare the results with theoretical calculations .",
    "finally , we discuss the significance of the comparison and provide some conclusions .",
    "the data used in this analysis are from part of the g11a experiment , which was taken from may 17 to july 29 , 2004 , using the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) located in hall - b at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) in newport news , virginia .",
    "real photons were produced by bremsstrahlung from a 4.0186 gev electron beam incident on a 1 @xmath29 10@xmath30 radiation length gold foil .",
    "the electron beam was delivered by the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) .",
    "the hall - b tagging system @xcite was used to determine the photon energies by measuring the energies of the recoil electrons using a dipole magnetic field and a scintillator hodoscope .",
    "the associated photon energies were then calculated by the difference between the incident electron energies and the recoil electron energies with an energy resolution of about 2 - 3 mev .",
    "the hall - b tagging system tags photons in the range from 20% to 95% of the incident electron energy .",
    "+ a liquid hydrogen target was used in the g11a experiment .",
    "the target was contained in a cylindrical kapton chamber of 2 cm radius and 40 cm length .",
    "the target density was determined by the temperature and pressure , which were monitored once per hour during the g11a experiment running .",
    "+ the clas apparatus was used to detect particles generated from the interaction of the incident photons with the target .",
    "the clas detector was able to track charged particles that have momenta larger than @xmath31200 mev , and the detection area covered polar angles from 8@xmath32 to 142@xmath32 and 80% of the azimuthal region .",
    "it was composed of several sub - systems , arranged with a six - fold azimuthal symmetry .",
    "a plastic scintillator start counter , placed just outside of the target , was used to measure the vertex time of particles in coincidence with the incoming photon .",
    "the start counter was made of 24 scintillator strips with a time resolution of @xmath31 350 ps @xcite .",
    "the superconducting coils of the clas detector generated a toroidal magnetic field that bent the path of outgoing charged particles .",
    "those particles traveled through 3 regions of drift chambers @xcite that measured the curved paths to give the particle momenta with a typical resolution of @xmath311.0% . for the g11a experiment ,",
    "the current in the superconducting coils was set at 1920 a , which gave a maximum magnetic field of @xmath31 1.8 t. the time of flight ( tof ) system was located beyond the outermost drift chambers at a radius of @xmath314 m from the target and was used to measure the time and position of each charged particle that hit the tof scintillators .",
    "the tof information , along with the particle momentum , was used for the particle identification in the analysis .",
    "the time resolution of the tof system was about 80 ps to 160 ps , depending on the length of the scintillators @xcite . a more detailed description of the clas detector is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . + the event trigger for the g11a experiment required that at least two tracks were detected in different sectors of clas .",
    "once the event satisfied this condition , it was written to tape for future analysis .",
    "the data acquisition system for the g11a experiment was able to run at @xmath31 5 khz with a typical livetime of 90% .",
    "as one of the largest photoproduction datasets at clas , the g11a experiment has @xmath3120 billion triggers .",
    "the calibration of each clas sub - system followed the same procedures as described in ref .",
    "additional details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because the @xmath19 is an unstable particle , it will quickly decay to @xmath33 ( see table [ particle ] ) by the strong interaction . by applying energy and momentum conservation ,",
    "the @xmath19 momentum is reconstructed from its decay particles , @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 is a mixture of 50% @xmath36 and 50% @xmath37 , but only the @xmath38 decay is detected by the clas detector .",
    "the @xmath39 is reconstructed from the @xmath38 decay to @xmath40 with a decay branching fraction of 69.2% .",
    "the same branching fractions are reproduced by the monte carlo detector simulations ( see section 3.6 ) , and hence are implicit in the detector acceptance values .",
    ".some physical properties of the @xmath19 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sysana_all ]      the models that are currently available for @xmath43 photoproduction are based on effective lagrangians , which fall into two groups : isobar models and reggeized meson exchange models .",
    "isobar models evaluate tree - level feynman diagrams , which include resonant and nonresonant exchanges of baryons and mesons .",
    "the reggeized models , on the other hand , emphasize the @xmath8-channel meson exchange , which is expected to dominate the reaction at energies above the resonance region .",
    "the standard propagators in the lagrangian are replaced by regge propagators , which take into account an entire family of exchanged particles with the same quantum numbers instead of just one meson exchange . in this section ,",
    "the @xmath4 cross section results will be compared with calculations from these two theoretical models .",
    "one model we use is by oh and kim ( o - k model ) @xcite , which is an isobar model .",
    "this model starts with born terms , which include @xmath8-channel ( with @xmath21 , @xmath43 and @xmath7 exchanges ) , @xmath44-channel ground state nucleon exchanges and @xmath45-channel @xmath41 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 exchanges .",
    "additional @xmath44-channel nucleon resonance exchanges were added to the model using the known resonances from the pdg in ref .",
    "@xcite , referred to here as the k - n - o - k model .",
    "one attractive point of these models is the inclusion of diagrams with a light @xmath7 meson exchange in the @xmath8-channel .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath7 meson has not yet been firmly established , and these models allows us to study the effect of possible @xmath7 exchange .",
    "the other model shown here is the ozaki , nagahiro and hosaka ( o - n - h ) model @xcite , which is a reggeized model .",
    "this model takes into account all possible hadron exchanges with the same quantum numbers ( except for the spin ) .",
    "the coupling constants and @xmath7 exchange parameters are the same as those used in o - k model @xcite .",
    "[ difcross_ksp_theory1 ] shows those calculations compared with our differential cross sections , where the solid curves represent the theoretical calculations from the k - n - o - k model and the dashed curves represent the o - n - h model .",
    "the corresponding curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ cross_lam_theory ] for the total cross sections , where the curves are explaind in the figure caption .",
    "the o - k model includes @xmath44-channel diagrams with most well - established nucleon resonances below 2 gev @xcite , whereas the k - n - o - k model includes two additional @xmath44-channel resonances up to 2.2 gev .",
    "interpretation of these results are discussed in section [ conclude ] .",
    "[ ratio ] shows the total cross section ratio of the reactions @xmath48 to @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3 data alone are not very sensitive to the @xmath7 exchange due to the unknown strength of the coupling constant , @xmath49 .",
    "however , the coupling constants of these two reactions is related in the effective lagrangian models , and so the ratio is sensitive to the effects of @xmath7 exchange . the dots with error bars in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] use the present data along with the previously published clas data for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we note that another data set exists for the @xmath51 reaction from cbelsa@xcite , but we have chosen to use clas data in both numerator and denominator to reduce systematics .",
    "the two curves are the theoretical predictions from o - k model i and ii @xcite , where model i includes minimal @xmath8-channel @xmath7 exchange , while model ii has a significant contribution from @xmath7 exchange .",
    "we presented here the first high - statistics measurement of the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the data are from the g11a experiment using the clas detector at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility .",
    "differential cross sections are presented for nine equal - spaced bins in @xmath52 for each photon energy bin of 0.1 gev width from threshold ( 1.7 or 1.8 gev , respectively ) up to 3.9 gev .",
    "total cross sections , based on fits to the differential cross sections are also presented for both reactions .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath4 final state are compared with calculations from two effective lagrangian models , one based on an isobar model and the other based on the regge model .",
    "neither calculation matches the data over the broad kinematic range measured here , but the isobar model compares more favorably , especially at higher photon energies .",
    "however , both models significantly underpredict the total cross sections in the range @xmath53 gev .",
    "inclusion of all well - known nucleon resonances improves agreement with the data in the region of @xmath54 gev , but has only a small contribution above @xmath55 gev , and can not explain this excess cross sections in the new data .",
    "it remains an open question whether the excess strength of the @xmath3 final state in this photon energy region is due to additional couplings to yet - unidentified nucleon resonances at higher mass , or whether it is due to other effects such as channel - coupling through final - state interactions or interference at the amplitude level with other physics processes such as photoproduction of the @xmath56 final state .",
    "the latter effect was studied using a simplified monte carlo generator and showed little or no effect due to interference with the @xmath56 final state , but more sophisticated theoretical calculations should be done to study interference effects .    in comparison , the @xmath57 final state has a sharper peak in the total cross section at @xmath58 gev , and falls off more quickly with increasing photon energy than for the @xmath4 final state .",
    "this suggests whatever mechanism that causes the excess cross section for the latter final state is not present in the @xmath57 photoproduction .",
    "however , theoretical calculations are not yet available for this final state , and we must wait for more theoretical development before any such conclusion can be reached .",
    "one of the goals of this measurement was to understand the role of the @xmath7 meson exchange , which can contribute to @xmath19 photoproduction but not to @xmath59 photoproduction .",
    "although no definite conclusion can be reached from the present data , the ratio of total cross sections for the @xmath4 and the @xmath51 final state compared with a similar ratio calculated in the model of oh and kim suggests that the model with significant @xmath7 exchange is in better agreement with the data ratio .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion from a recent study of the beam asymmetry measurement @xcite of the @xmath51 final state using a linearly polarized photon beam at forward angles .",
    "however , we must be careful in making any firm conclusion regarding the role of the @xmath7 exchange until the theoretical models have better agreement with the @xmath4 total cross sections above @xmath60 gev .",
    "the excess strength of the new data above 2.1 gev may change the effects of @xmath7 exchange in the ratio .",
    "however , the general idea of comparing the @xmath4 and @xmath51 cross sections , which are affected differently by @xmath7 exchange , is something that can be studied now that these new data are available .",
