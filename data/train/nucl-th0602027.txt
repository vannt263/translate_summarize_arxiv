    "calculations from a simple hadronic rescattering model have been shown to agree reasonably well with experimental results obtained from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with @xmath0 = 130 gev and 200 gev au + au collisions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , these calculations provide good representations of the data for 1 ) the particle mass dependence of the @xmath1 distribution slope parameters ( i.e. radial flow ) , 2 ) the @xmath2 , particle mass , and pseudorapidity dependences of the elliptic flow , and 3 ) the @xmath2 , centrality , and azimuthal angle dependences of two - pion hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) measurements . although the agreement between the model and data is sometimes more qualitative than quantitative , this agreement with such a broad range of rhic experimental observables is still a noteworthy accomplishment for a single , simple , model .",
    "many hadrons are initially produced in a relatively small volume in rhic - type collisions , particularly at early times in the interaction .",
    "it is a challenging task for a monte carlo calculation of this type to deal accurately with binary collisions between particles in such a large particle density environment without introducing numerical artifacts which may affect the results .",
    "one such undesirable artifact that can occur when the interaction range between two particles is much greater than the scattering mean - free - path is non - causality of the collisions resulting in superluminal particle velocities@xcite .",
    "the method of subdivision can be used to minimize these artifacts associated with high particle density@xcite .",
    "the effects of such artifacts on observables calculated from the rescattering model are studied in the present work in two ways : 1 ) varying the time step and 2 ) using the subdivision method .",
    "the goal will be to determine whether non - causal artifacts are present in the rescattering model and , if so , whether they have appreciable effects on the calculated observables .",
    "this will provide a test of whether or not one can have confidence in the results of this rescattering model for rhic energies .",
    "section ii will describe the calculational methods used and section iii with give the results of the study .",
    "a brief description of the rescattering model calculational method is given below .",
    "the method used is similar to that used in previous calculations for lower cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energies @xcite . rescattering is simulated with a semi - classical monte carlo calculation which assumes strong binary collisions between hadrons .",
    "the monte carlo calculation is carried out in three stages : 1 ) initialization and hadronization , 2 ) rescattering and freeze out , and 3 ) calculation of experimental observables .",
    "relativistic kinematics is used throughout .",
    "all calculations are made to simulate rhic - energy au+au collisions .",
    "the hadronization model employs simple parameterizations to describe the initial momenta and space - time of the hadrons similar to that used by herrmann and bertsch @xcite .",
    "the initial momenta are assumed to follow a thermal transverse ( perpendicular to the beam direction ) momentum distribution for all particles , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transverse mass , @xmath2 is the transverse momentum , @xmath5 is the particle rest mass , @xmath6 is a normalization constant , and @xmath7 is the initial `` temperature parameter '' of the system , and a gaussian rapidity distribution for mesons , @xmath8}\\ ] ] where @xmath9}$ ] is the rapidity , @xmath10 is the particle energy , @xmath11 is the longitudinal ( along the beam direction ) momentum , @xmath12 is a normalization constant , @xmath13 is the central rapidity value ( mid - rapidity ) , and @xmath14 is the rapidity width .",
    "two rapidity distributions for baryons have been tried : 1 ) flat and then falling off near beam rapidity and 2 ) peaked at central rapidity and falling off until beam rapidity .",
    "both baryon distributions give about the same results .",
    "the initial space - time of the hadrons for @xmath15 fm ( i.e. zero impact parameter or central collisions ) is parameterized as having cylindrical symmetry with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the transverse particle density dependence is assumed to be that of a projected uniform sphere of radius equal to the projectile radius , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 fm and @xmath19 is the atomic mass number of the projectile ) . for @xmath20 ( non - central collisions )",
    "the transverse particle density is that of overlapping projected spheres whose centers are separated by a distance @xmath21 .",
    "the particle multiplicities for @xmath20 are scaled from the @xmath15 values by the ratio of the overlap volume to the volume of the projectile . the longitudinal particle hadronization position ( @xmath22 ) and time ( @xmath23 )",
    "are determined by the relativistic equations @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the particle rapidity and @xmath26 is the hadronization proper time .",
    "thus , apart from particle multiplicities , the hadronization model has three free parameters to extract from experiment : @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "the hadrons included in the calculation are pions , kaons , nucleons and lambdas ( @xmath27 , k , n , and @xmath28 ) , and the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 resonances . for simplicity",
    ", the calculation is isospin averaged ( e.g. no distinction is made among a @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "resonances are present at hadronization and also can be produced as a result of rescattering .",
    "initial resonance multiplicity fractions are taken from herrmann and bertsch @xcite , who extracted results from the helios experiment @xcite .",
    "the initial resonance fractions used in the present calculations are : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and , for simplicity , @xmath44 .",
    "the second stage in the calculation is rescattering which finishes with the freeze out and decay of all particles . starting from the initial stage ( @xmath45 fm / c ) , the positions of all particles are allowed to evolve in time in small time steps ( normally @xmath46 fm / c is used ) according to their initial momenta . at each time",
    "step each particle is checked to see a ) if it decays , and b ) if it is sufficiently close to another particle to scatter with it .",
    "isospin - averaged s - wave and p - wave cross sections for meson scattering are obtained from prakash et al . @xcite .",
    "the calculation is carried out to 100 fm / c , although most of the rescattering finishes by about 30 fm / c .",
    "the rescattering calculation is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "calculations are carried out assuming initial parameter values and particle multiplicities for each type of particle . in the last stage of the calculation ,",
    "the freeze - out and decay momenta and space - times are used to produce observables such as pion , kaon , and nucleon multiplicities and transverse momentum and rapidity distributions .",
    "the values of the initial parameters of the calculation and multiplicities are constrained to give observables which agree with available measured hadronic observables . as a cross - check on this ,",
    "the total kinetic energy from the calculation is determined and compared with the rhic center of mass energy to see that they are in reasonable agreement .",
    "particle multiplicities were estimated from the charged hadron multiplicity measurements of the rhic phobos experiment @xcite .",
    "calculations were carried out using isospin - summed events containing at freezeout for central collisions ( @xmath15 fm ) about 5000 pions , 500 kaons , and 650 nucleons ( @xmath28 s were decayed ) .",
    "the hadronization model parameters used were @xmath47 mev , @xmath14=2.4 , and @xmath26=1 fm / c .",
    "it is interesing to note that the same value of @xmath26 was required in a previous rescattering calculation to successfully describe results from sps pb+pb collisions @xcite .    as an indicator of the presence of superluminal artifacts , the transverse signal propagation velocity , @xmath48 ,",
    "is calculated for all particle pairs in the rescattering calculation for each time step from@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the signal propagation velocity vector , @xmath51 is the position of particle 1 for the present collision with particle 2 at time @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the position of particle 2 for its previous collision at time @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the perpendicular components of @xmath57 in the transverse plane .",
    "note that even though the rescattering calculations are carried out with relativistic kinematics , it is still possible for @xmath48 to be greater than @xmath58 for some particle pairs due to the details of how the two - particle collisions are implemented .",
    "the method of subdivision is based on the invariance of monte carlo particle - scattering calculations for a simultaneous decrease of the scattering cross sections by some factor , @xmath59 , and increase of the particle density by @xmath59 , where @xmath59 is called the subdivision@xcite . as @xmath59 becomes sufficiently large , non - causal artifacts",
    "become insignificant .",
    "the present rescattering calculation will be tested comparing pion observables from the `` nominal '' calculation , i.e. @xmath60 , with subdivisions of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that a subdivision of @xmath61 has been shown to significantly suppress non - causal artifacts present in some monte carlo calculations@xcite . since the particle density increase is accomplished by increasing the particle number by a factor @xmath59 , the computer cpu time taken per event increases by a factor @xmath63 .",
    "for the present study , 1640 , 124 and 120 events were generated for the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 samples , respectively .",
    "fortunately , the statistical value of the @xmath64 events is @xmath59 times greater per event than for @xmath60 . as an example , the cpu time taken to generate the @xmath62 sample of events was 600 cpu - hours on 2.8 ghz pc processors at the ohio supercomputing center .",
    "figures 1 - 8 present results from the hadronic rescattering model simulating hadrons produced in rhic - energy collisions for various time steps and subdivisions .",
    "quantities plotted are @xmath48 histograms including all particles in the calculation and several hadronic observables",
    ". descriptions of how the observables are extracted from the rescattering calculation are given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "all calculations are carried out for a mid - rapidity bin , @xmath65 , and for an impact parameter of 8 fm to simulate a medium non - central collision which should result in significant elliptic flow for the purposes of the present test .",
    "statistical errors are shown either as error bars or are of the order of the marker size when error bars are not shown .",
    "figures 1 - 4 show comparisons of various quantities for three different time steps in the rescattering calculations , @xmath66 and @xmath67 fm / c .",
    "the time step used in calculating observables which have been compared with rhic data is @xmath46 fm / c@xcite , so the other time steps used represent half of the usual step and twice the usual step .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath48 histograms .",
    "transverse signal velocity distributions for all particles for various time steps.,width=529 ]    it is seen that @xmath48 extends beyond @xmath58 with an exponential tail for all time steps , indicating the presence of superluminal artifacts . for @xmath68 all time steps",
    "lie on top of each other whereas for @xmath69 they differ somewhat according to what would be expected for the different time steps , i.e. smaller and thus more frequent time steps should enhance the superluminal artifacts , whereas larger and thus less frequent time steps should reduce the artifacts . for @xmath70 fm / c an enhancement of @xmath71 in the artifacts over the nominal case",
    "is seen , while in the case of @xmath72 fm / c a reduction in the artifacts by about @xmath73 over the nominal time step is seen .",
    "the effects of these time steps on various hadronic observables are shown in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "pion , kaon , and nucleon @xmath1 distributions for various time steps.,width=529 ]     pion elliptic flow vs. @xmath2 for various time steps.,width=529 ]     two - pion hbt source parameters vs. @xmath2 for various time steps .",
    "the ordinate scale for @xmath74 is shown to the right.,width=529 ]    figure 2 shows @xmath1 distributions for pions , kaons , and nucleons , figure 3 shows the elliptic flow , @xmath75 , vs. @xmath2 for pions and figure 4 shows two - pion hbt source parameters@xcite vs. @xmath2 . as seen in all three figures , even though the different time steps have noticeable effects on the artifacts ( as seen in figure 1 ) , they do not significantly effect the hadronic observables , the observables for all three time steps agreeing within the statistical errors of the calculations .      since it could be argued that the time step study presented above may not reduce the superluminal artifacts enough to see significant effects on the hadronic observables , the subdivision test is also employed since it provides a greater ability to reduce these artifacts .",
    "this is seen in figure 5 which shows @xmath48 histograms for the three subdivision used : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "transverse signal velocity distributions for all particles for @xmath78 and @xmath77.,width=529 ]    while all three subdivisions mostly lie on top of each other for @xmath68 , one sees factors of 5 - 10 reductions in the superluminal artifacts for @xmath61 and @xmath77 .",
    "if these artifacts have a large influence on the values of the hadronic observables extracted from the rescattering model , it should surely be evident for the @xmath61 and @xmath77 cases .",
    "figures 6 - 8 show the effects of these different subdivisions on pion @xmath2 distributions , elliptic flow and hbt , respectively .",
    "pion @xmath2 distributions for @xmath78 and @xmath77.,width=529 ]     pion elliptic flow vs. @xmath2 for @xmath78 and @xmath77.,width=529 ]     two - pion hbt source parameters vs. @xmath2 for @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "the ordinate scale for @xmath74 is shown to the right.,width=529 ]    as was the case in the time step study , the hadronic observables shown in figures 6 - 8 are not significantly effected by the different subdivisions used in spite of the fact that superluminal artifacts are greatly suppressed in the subdivision study .",
    "it can be concluded from figures 1 - 8 that non - causal ( superluminal ) artifacts while being present in the hadronic rescattering code used in this study do not significantly effect the hadronic observables calculated from this code .",
    "it is possible to speculate on why this is the case .",
    "there are three main features of the code which might tend to reduce the effects of these artifacts : 1 ) individual particles are allowed to scatter only once per time step , 2 ) a `` scattering time '' of two nominal time steps is defined during which particles that have scattered are not allowed to rescatter , and 3 ) once two particles have scattered with each other , they are not allowed to scatter with each other again in the calculation .",
    "the present study was performed for non - central collisions ( @xmath79 fm ) , but it is expected that the same conclusion , i.e. that superluminal artifacts do not significantly effect the results of calculations with the rescattering code , would also be obtained for central collisions . this is because the particle density is not very different for central collisions in the model than for mid - peripheral collisions since the particle multiplicities are scaled by the overlap volume for @xmath20 , as mentioned earlier .    in summary , two methods have been used to test the validity of the present rescattering model calculations in the presence of non - causal ( superluminal ) artifacts .",
    "it is found that the results of this model are not appreciably effected by such artifacts , thus strengthing the confidence in the results presented previously from this rescattering model for rhic .",
    "the author wishes to thank tams csrg , dnes molnr and derek teaney for helpful discussions relating to this paper .",
