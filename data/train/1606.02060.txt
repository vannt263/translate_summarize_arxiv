    "in particular , is it true that @xmath172 ?",
    "given dimensions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we would like a general approach that would allow us to construct minimum dominating sets of , or at least reasonably small dominating sets .",
    "we have two difficulties to consider .",
    "the first difficulty was just discussed : in general we know the value of @xmath23 only approximately .",
    "the second difficulty is that construction of a dominating set of  generally means specifying most or all of the lines that the set is to occupy .",
    "there are some restrictions that the numbers of the lines must satisfy , as we now describe .",
    "let @xmath173 be a set of @xmath174 squares of  that occupies difference diagonals @xmath175 and sum diagonals @xmath176 .",
    "since the square  is on the difference diagonal  with number @xmath21 and the sum diagonal  with number @xmath22 , summing over @xmath2 gives @xmath177    the parallelogram law @xmath178 gives a quadratic constraint @xmath179 on the line numbers .    in each of the two constructions given below , we will refer to lines that must be occupied for domination as _ required _ lines and other lines as _ auxiliary _ lines .",
    "both constructions produce a number of minimum dominating sets , but neither can produce a dominating set of  of size less than @xmath180 . this is a little evidence for the possible bound mentioned in question [ whatlowerbound ] .",
    "this idea generalizes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set of squares of .",
    "if it is possible to place the origin of the coordinate system so that every even column and every even row contains a square of @xmath2 , we will say @xmath2 is an _ orthodox _ set .",
    "that is , an orthodox set is one that occupies at least every other column and every other row of .",

    "it is clear from the definition that a 0-cover dominates every even square of , and since every odd square of  is on one even - numbered orthogonal , all odd squares are also dominated : a 0-cover is a dominating set of .",
    "many 0-covers appear in the http://www.sztaki.mta.hu/%7ebozoki/queens[appendix ] , and are labeled there as such .",

    "generally , we expect that most of the squares of @xmath2 will be even - even , to help dominate the odd - odd squares diagonally .",
    "when @xmath6 is considerably larger than @xmath5 , there are more possibilities of placing queens on odd squares that occupy even columns . also , it is possible sometimes to achieve a dominating set of size less than @xmath180 by a minor modification , as is shown in solution http://www.sztaki.mta.hu/%7ebozoki/queens/07x12_5q.html#solution1[#1 ] for in table 1 . if the center of the square there labeled @xmath183 is taken to be the origin of the coordinate system , the dominating set shown misses being an orthodox set only by not occupying the rightmost column .",
    "thus the three odd - odd squares in that column are not covered along their column , as they would be by an orthodox set .",

    "the required column numbers are @xmath195 , so there will be no auxiliary column numbers .",
    "the required row numbers are @xmath196 , so there will be three auxiliary row numbers @xmath197 .    from ( [ linearcon ] ) we have @xmath198 and ( [ plleleq ] ) gives @xmath199 .",
    "we first attempt to find a solution with symmetry by a half - turn about the board center : this means @xmath200 .",
    "then the quadratic constraint simplifies to @xmath201 , of which one solution is @xmath202",
    ". now all lines are specified , and it is not difficult to find the solution @xmath203 .",
    "we begin by considering a board @xmath73 which is to be a central sub - board of a larger board @xmath204 .",
    "say that @xmath73 has @xmath205 rows and @xmath206 columns , with @xmath207 and @xmath208 not both even .",
    "it is convenient here to have the board squares of side length two , and place @xmath73 with its center at the origin . thus if , for example , @xmath205 is odd and @xmath206 is even , then each square has center  with @xmath18 an odd integer and @xmath19 an even one .",
    "we then wish to choose a nonnegative integer @xmath31 and a set @xmath2 of squares of @xmath204 ( actually , all or almost all in @xmath73 ) such that @xmath2 contains at least one square from the extension of each orthogonal of @xmath73 to @xmath204 , and @xmath2 contains exactly one square from the extension of each difference diagonal  of @xmath73 , except none from the highest @xmath31 and the lowest @xmath31 extended difference diagonals ; similarly for sum diagonals .",
    "let @xmath209 then @xmath8 , and it is straightforward to verify that if @xmath73 is taken to be the central @xmath210 sub - board of the @xmath1 board @xmath204 , then @xmath2 is a dominating set of  and @xmath211 .",
    "such a @xmath2 will be called a _ centrally strong _ set , as it generalizes the idea discussed for square boards in @xcite .",
    "we note that our definition requires each square of @xmath2 to have both diagonals among the required ones , and thus both have numbers of absolute value at most @xmath212 , but this does not imply @xmath213 .",

    "we note that these sets can only occur when @xmath214 ; this follows from ( [ mnk ] ) and the fact that since there will be @xmath215 auxiliary row numbers , this quantity is nonnegative .",
    "one merit of this construction is that a single centrally strong @xmath2 gives an upper bound for  for several pairs @xmath59 since @xmath2 is confined to a small central region of the @xmath1 board , especially if @xmath2 is strict .",
    "for example , there is a strict centrally strong set @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 with @xmath221 , and @xmath222 , which shows that @xmath223 when @xmath224 .",

    "the simplest centrally strong sets occur with @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , where we get @xmath205 queens occupying all squares of the @xmath230 board @xmath73 , and the following bound ( which we have stated in terms of @xmath231 ) .",
    "for @xmath232 at least , this bound gives the exact value of @xmath233 .",

    "similarly the sum of the sum diagonal  numbers of @xmath2 is zero , and then ( [ linearcon ] ) implies that @xmath236 and @xmath237 . as we require a centrally strong set to occupy all ( extended ) columns of the sub - board , we regard the @xmath206 numbers of these columns as required column numbers ; by symmetry their sum is zero",
