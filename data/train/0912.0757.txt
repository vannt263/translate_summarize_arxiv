    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) help us to explore the history of the cosmos ( see , e.g. , riess et al . 2007 ;",
    "kuznetsova et al .",
    "2008 ) . yet we still know little about their progenitors .",
    "there are two classes of progenitor models .",
    "( see kotak 2009 and branch et al .",
    "1995 for reviews . ) in  single degenerate \" models , the progenitors are accreting white dwarfs ( wds ) . in `` double - degenerate '' models ,",
    "the explosion is initiated through mass transfer between and/or the merger of two wds .",
    "this paper is devoted to searching for the progenitors .    in  2",
    "we show that , if the single - degenerate model is dominant , then galaxies such as our own and m31 contain on the order of @xmath5 nuclear - burning wds ( nbwds ) that will explode within @xmath6  years . in ",
    "3 we show that these progenitors could be hot and bright enough to be detected as supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) in many external galaxies .",
    "we then show that existing data from _ chandra _ place strict limits on the numbers of type  ia progenitors that are detected as ssss . in section",
    " 4 we discuss the implications .",
    "these are explored more fully , in the context of binary models for 1  s , in the companion paper ( distefano 2009 ) .",
    "in single - degenerate models , a wd must accrete and retain matter .",
    "let @xmath7 represent the initial mass of the wd .",
    "an explosion occurs when the mass has increased to a value @xmath8 we start with models in which @xmath9 is the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath10 the wd must have a donor that can contribute the requisite mass . in addition , the rate of mass infall , @xmath11 , must be large enough that accreted matter can be burned and retained .",
    "the rate of genuine mass increase , @xmath12 , is determined by the rate of infall to the wd and a retention factor @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 the top panel of figure 1 illustrates that mass retention requires mass donation rates in a narrow range between @xmath15 ( roughly @xmath16  yr@xmath3 for a solar - mass co wd ) , and @xmath17 , which is generally a few times larger than @xmath15 .",
    "this range corresponds to rates of infall for which accreting matter can undergo quasisteady nuclear burning .",
    "need not be equal to unity . for example , some of the infalling mass may be driven from the  in the form of winds . ] for @xmath18 , not all of the incoming matter can be burned , and @xmath19 declines . for @xmath20 ,",
    "incoming matter accumulates and burns episodically . for rates just below @xmath21",
    "the explosions are frequent ( separated by decades ) and weak , corresponding to recurrent novae ( rne ) ; @xmath19 can be close to unity .",
    "the lower the rate of infall , the more violent are the explosions produced by nuclear burning , and the more matter is ejected from the system . in some cases ,",
    "more matter may be ejected than is accumulated between novae ; @xmath19 is negative .",
    "most of the accreting wds already identified are cataclysmic variables with accretion rates typically two orders of magnitude or more below the rate required for steady burning .",
    "binaries can produce the requisite high rates , however ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) .    the duration , @xmath22 of the accretion phase is @xmath23 there may be long periods in which the mass transfer period is too low ( or too high ) for mass retention . in this paper",
    "we are concerned primarily with the interval during which the value of @xmath11 is large enough that infalling mass is burned and retained .",
    "the approximate duration of this interval can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath24 where the value of @xmath25 represents an average during the epoch when the wd s mass is changing .",
    "the rate of sne ia in galaxies is roughly @xmath26 per century per @xmath27 in blue luminosity ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993 ; turatto et al .",
    "1994 ) . in a galaxy with blue luminosity @xmath28",
    "the number , @xmath29 , of accreting progenitors within @xmath30 of @xmath4 is roughly @xmath31 to determine the expected range of values of @xmath32 we assess the range of likely values of each factor .",
    "the amount of mass , @xmath33 that the  must gain is constrained from below by the requirement that the accretor must start as a co , while s born with the highest mass start as o - ne - mg s , which undergo accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) upon achieving @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , nomoto et al . 1979 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath34 can therefore not be smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the numbers of high - mass s are constrained by two considerations .",
    "first the initial mass function favors low - mass stars ( miller & scalo 1979 ; salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "second , low - mass stars produce low - mass s ( kalirai et al .",
    "2008 ; cataln et al .",
    "2009 ; dobbie et al . 2006 ; williams 2007 ; weideman & koester 1983 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath34 is almost certainly in the range : @xmath36 , consistent with @xmath29 in the range @xmath37 . in order for the average value of @xmath34 to be small enough to place @xmath29 below @xmath38 , the relationship between a star and the mass and/or composition of the remnant would have to be different from current models .",
    "alternatively , part of the answer could be that o - ne - mg s produce 1e .",
    "either case would represent a shift in our understanding of fundamental astrophysics .",
    "if the average value of @xmath25 is larger than @xmath39  yr@xmath3 , this would reduce the value of @xmath29 .",
    "higher rates of nuclear burning will , however , produce luminosities that exceed the eddington luminosity .",
    "it is more likely that the average rate at which mass is accreted is actually smaller , producing larger values of @xmath29 .",
    "note in addition that calculations by different groups agree on the general range of @xmath11 needed for high - mass s to burn accreting matter ( see , e.g. , nomoto 1982 ; iben 1982 , fujimoto 1982 ; shen & bildsten 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the third factor influencing the value of @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath40 this factor is included because observations find that the rate of type ia supernova scales with @xmath40 as more 1e are discovered in more galaxies , this rate is becoming better measured .",
    "( see , e.g. , dilday et al .",
    "2008 ; graham et al .",
    "2008 ; kuznetsova et al . 2008 ; poznanski et al . 2008 ; panagia et al . 2007 . )",
    "it is unlikely that the estimated rates will change enough to reduce or enhance the predicted values of @xmath29 by a factor as large as @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , taking into account the range of possible values of the factors in equation 4 , we find that for spiral galaxies similar to the milky way and m31 ( and even for ellipticals , with a lower rate of sne ia ) , @xmath29 can not be much smaller than several hundred , and is likely to be significantly larger .",
    "the assumptions that lead to to these predictions are that ( 1 )  the -d  channel produces the majority of 1e , and ( 2 ) nuclear burning of accreted material is needed to prevent explosive mass loss .",
    "the crucial point is that nuclear - burning , either episodic or quasisteady , appears to be necessary for the retention of matter by wds .",
    "the burning of matter releases a great deal of energy .",
    "@xmath42 in this equation , @xmath43 is the power released through the burning of accreted material ; @xmath44 is the fraction of the incoming matter burned , and @xmath45 is the efficiency .",
    "consider a wd with accretion rate in the steady - burning regime . because the mass infall rate is large , the accretion luminosity is also large , although typically less than @xmath46 of the power provided by nuclear burning .",
    "if , however , the accretion rate lies slightly below the steady - burning regime , then nuclear burning will occur only episodically , during recurrent novae .",
    "in contrast , the accretion luminosity , which can be @xmath47  erg  s@xmath3 for high - mass s , could make the system appear bright even between nova explosions . therefore , particularly when nuclear burning is occurring , but even when mass infall rates are slightly below the nuclear - burning limit , accreting wds that are type  ia progenitors should be highly luminous ( second panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "we address the issue of the detectability of the accretion luminosity in the companion paper ( distefano 2009 ) .      as the third panel of figure 1 shows , effective values of @xmath48 for nbwds",
    "are expected to be in the range of tens of ev .",
    "the x - ray missions _ einstein",
    "_ and _ rosat _ had good low - energy sensitivity and could detect soft x - ray sources in the local group . by the mid-1990s ,",
    "more than @xmath49 sources with the properties expected for nbwds had been discovered .",
    "( see greiner 2000 for a catalog and for references . )",
    "the soft emitters were dubbed luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) .",
    "a natural conjecture is that the ssss are in fact nbwds .",
    "some nearby ssss are known to be hot white dwarfs post - nova , or are pre - wds still ensconced in planetary nebulae .",
    "the binary properties of roughly half of the ssss with optical ids suggests that they might be wds accreting at high - enough rates to burn matter in a quasisteady fashion .",
    "soon after their discovery , it was conjectured that some ssss could be s of aic ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) or of 1e ( rappaport , di  stefano & smith 1994 ) .    as figure  1 demonstrates , the temperature is higher for wds with higher mass .",
    "this is because higher - mass wds ( 1 )  are smaller , and ( 2 )  require a higher infall rate , and therefore a higher rate of nuclear burning . in principle , nbwds with mass close to @xmath4 can have values of @xmath48 near or even slightly above @xmath50  ev .",
    "distefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) modeled the gas distribution of several galaxies to determine what fraction of ssss could be detected as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . while only roughly a percent of low - l / low - t ssss could be detected by _ rosat _",
    ", almost all ssss associated with nbwds with mass near @xmath4 could be detected in m31 , because they are both hot and bright .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that , with _",
    "chandra _ , for typical amounts of absorption , we can expect to have a complete census of nbwds with masses within a few tenths of @xmath4 in m31 , m101 , m83 , and m51 .",
    "in fact , with typical values of @xmath53  @xmath54 , the _ chandra _ exposures we analyzed should allow us to detect and identify all nbwds with @xmath55 larger than @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) in m31 ( m81 and m83 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies are good places in which to hunt for bright ssss because they have relatively small amounts of gas and dust .",
    "if , therefore , ( 1 ) the class of type ia progenitors consists primarily of accreting white dwarfs with mass close to @xmath58 and ( 2 ) these white dwarfs are burning the accreted matter in a quasi - steady manner , and ( 3 ) this produces luminosities and temperatures in the expected regime , then these galaxies should each contain at least several hundred hot , bright , and detectable ssss .",
    ".soft sources in external galaxies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      table 1 shows the numbers of soft x - ray sources in each of six galaxies that have been carefully studied ( distefano et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b , 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "m101 , m83 , and m51 are spiral galaxies .",
    "m104 is a bulge - dominated spiral , while both ngc4472 and ngc4697 are elliptical galaxies .",
    "two categories of soft sources are listed .",
    "\\(1 ) * ssss",
    "* refer to sources with values of @xmath48 below @xmath59  ev .",
    "these should encompass the majority of nbwds , including all of the type ia progenitors . in each case , the numbers of ssss actually detected are smaller than the numbers of predicted type ia progenitors by more than an order of magnitude . furthermore , only a fraction of the detected ssss are candidate s of 1e .",
    "this is because luminosities and temperatures of many of the detected ssss are so low that , if they correspond to nbwds , the mass of the white dwarf is much smaller than @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , pence et al .",
    "on the other hand , some ssss are too luminous to correspond to nbwds .",
    "some ultraluminous ssss , with x - ray luminosities above @xmath60  erg  s@xmath3 , may be accreting black holes ( kong & di  stefano 2005 ; mukai et al .",
    "2005 ; kong et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "( 2 )  * quasisoft sources ( qsss ) * are sources that are slightly harder than ssss , but which exhibit little or no emission above @xmath41  kev ( di  stefano & kong 2004 ; di  stefano et al .",
    "2004a ; di  stefano et al .",
    "with effective values of @xmath48 above @xmath61  ev , some could be nbwds with mass near @xmath62 the addition of a small hard component and/or high levels of absorption could cause such a source to have a qss spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , many qsss are too hard to be associated with nbwds . at most a small fraction",
    "could be progenitors of type ia sne .",
    "* results : * at most , a modest fraction of all ssss and qsss could be s of 1e . yet , even if the total of all ssss _ and _ qsss in each galaxy were s , they would constitute less than a tenth of the total nbwds with mass near @xmath4 needed to provide the observed rate of 1e .",
    "therefore , even if some of the detected ssss and qss are s , there is a clear and large mismatch , with at least @xmath63 of the actively accreting s not appearing as ssss or qsss .",
    "figure  2 also indicates that the observations already place limits on the numbers of lower - mass nbwds in each of several galaxies",
    ".    it may be important to note , however , that there is an interesting trend in the data .",
    "that is , both the rate of 1e and the number of ssss are significantly larger in late - type galaxies than in early - type galaxies .",
    "if the rate of mass transfer is high enough to support quasisteady - nuclear burning , then the character of the disk is remarkable , because the total accretion energy is only a small fraction of the energy provided to the disk by the  through irradiation and heating .",
    "the inner disk itself becomes a source of supersoft x - rays . at x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "the effect is therefore to make the source marginally brighter , but to likely keep it in the sss regime .",
    "should it b      an automated source detection and identification process was employed by liu ( 2008 ) to study x - ray sources in fields containing 383 nearby galaxies .",
    "ssss and qsss were identified using the same algorithm used for the galaxies in table 1 .",
    "liu found that only @xmath64 of all sources bright enough for spectral classification are sss .",
    "for every sss there are roughly four qsss .",
    "the combination of ssss and qsss constitute about @xmath65 of all x - ray sources .",
    "yet , the total numbers of x - ray sources per galaxy were generally several times smaller than the expected population of nuclear - burning type ia progenitors .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the numbers of progenitors and the total numbers of soft sources per galaxy is typically larger than an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , a significant fraction of the soft sources have x - ray luminosities above @xmath60  erg  s@xmath3 , and are therefore not good candidates for white dwarf accretors .",
    "liu created merged images to achieve effective exposure times far longer than those utilized in figure 2 .",
    "the total exposure time of m101 , for example , is roughly ten times the value used to create figure  2 .",
    "this means that liu s catalog can be used to place stringent limits on sub - chandrasekhar models ( with white dwarf masses as low as @xmath56 ) as well as on chandrasekhar - mass models .",
    "note that , in addition to the observations of the previous subsection , and the work of liu ( 2008 ) , many studies of extragalactic x - ray sources have identified ssss .",
    "see , e.g. , sarazin et al.(2001 ) ; swartz et al.(2002 ) ; pence et al.(2001 ) ; jenkins et al.(2004 ) ; fabbiano et al.(2003 ) .",
    "we focus on the liu ( 2008 ) paper because it is comprehensive and uses uniform detection and selection procedures .",
    "note , however , that the results of the individual studies are consistent with those of liu : the total numbers of bright ssss per galaxy is small , consistent with the source counts presented in table 1 .",
    "m31 is a special case because of its proximity .",
    "a source with x - ray luminosity ( @xmath66 kev ) of @xmath67 , possibly corresponding to a nbwd with mass within roughly @xmath68 of @xmath58 would produce a count rate of @xmath69 in acis - s , or @xmath70 in acis - i .",
    "since most exposures of m31 are longer than @xmath71  ksec , these sources are readily detected and their spectra can be classified as sss . a source which exhibits a small hard component might appear as a qss , producing an even higher count rate .",
    "distefano et al .",
    "( 2004b ) published a list of @xmath72 ssss and qsss drawn from three regions in the disk and also from the galactic bulge .",
    "of these , only @xmath73 sources ( @xmath74 of them in the bulge ) , had count rates above @xmath75 .",
    "most of the detected soft sources are too dim to be high - mass nbwds .",
    "these observations cover only a fraction of the galaxy .",
    "( note that most of the ssss are in the center , which was well covered , so the total number of sources we expect does not scale with the area covered . )",
    "orio ( 2006 ) identified ssss and qsss in m31 by using deep _ xmm - newton _ observations that covered the entire body of the galaxy .",
    "using x - ray spectral information alone , orio found significant contamination from supernova remnants .",
    "the data contained evidence for @xmath76 ssss and @xmath77 qsss that were not associated with known supernova remnants .",
    "in addition , orio found that about one in ten nova outbursts in m31 produces sss - behavior post nova .",
    "the link to novae has been studied in more detail using additional data sets ( pietsch et al . 2006 ; henze et al . 2009 ) .",
    "della valle & livio ( 1996 ) have demonstrated that only @xmath78 of all novae are likely to be rne , retaining most of the matter they accrete .",
    "most novae , therefore , are not 1  candidates . in summary ,",
    "the total number of ssss detected in m31 is smaller than the requisite number of s , and many of the ones that are detected are not good candidates for type  ia s. in fact in m31 , where typical values of @xmath79 are @xmath80  @xmath81 we likely have a complete census of nbwds with mass greater than roughly @xmath82 this places strong limits on sub - chandrasekhar models .",
    "only a handful of ssss have been discovered in the milky way .",
    "this small number is consistent with the fact that absorption by the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the  disk can  the soft emanating from  - m  s. if , however , the galaxy contains @xmath83  -m  s , @xmath84 of them should lie within roughly a kpc .",
    "if these have values of @xmath48 in the range @xmath85  ev and luminosities of @xmath86  erg  s@xmath3 , they will be easily detected by rosat , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_.    for",
    "_ chandra _ count rates we can scale from the numbers given in the paragraph on m31 ; the  count rates would be @xmath87  times higher . while the  count rates would be smaller than the  rates by a factor of @xmath88 , the _ all - sky survey _",
    "could have discovered all -m  s within a kpc , even along directions in the sky in which the exposure times were shortest .",
    "the persistent ssss discovered by _",
    "rosat _ were dimmer and cooler than -m   nbwds ( greiner 2000 ) .",
    "the failure to detect bright , hot ssss and/or qsss in the neighborhood ( @xmath89  kpc ) of the sun is an independent indication that such sources do not comprise the majority of 1  s.      the most direct way to determine if 1e are generated by ssss is to check pre - explosion x - ray images .",
    "voss & nelemans ( 2008 ) found @xmath73 galaxies that had been observed by prior to a 1  .",
    "there was no sign of an x - ray source in the vicinities of @xmath74 of the supernovae .",
    "the detection limits were below those expected for high - mass nbwds .",
    "in one case , there was a nearby source , but it was @xmath90 from the supernova ( @xmath91  pc in projection ; roelofs et al .",
    "2008 ) , and was neither an sss nor a qss .",
    "the discovery of ssss seemed to provide hope that type  ia progenitors could be identified in a fairly straightforward way , through the signatures of their soft x - ray emission . while some bright ssss may be progenitors of type  ia supernovae , we can now say conclusively that the majority of the progenitors do not appear as bright ssss during intervals long enough ( @xmath92  yrs ) to allow quasisteady burning of the necessary amounts of accreting matter .",
    "the discrepancy is at least an order of magnitude , and may be as much as two orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , we find that existing data already place restrictions on sub - chandrasekhar models ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these restrictions will be tightened as more data are analyzed , and additional exposures with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ become available .",
    "although we have ruled out the possibility that the majority of 1  s appear as ssss during much of the all - important mass - gaining phase , there is almost certainly a tight link between ssss and 1  s. while there are several ways to `` hide '' the soft x - ray emission from nbwds ( see the companion paper , distefano 2009 ) , it is difficult to construct a model in which a  burns a tenth of a solar mass or more , yet never exhibits at least brief sss or qss phases .",
    "for example , some s may experience short periods of sss behavior during the time when the system approaches or passes the minimum accretion rate needed for steady burning .",
    "this can happen both as mass transfer ramps up and also as it ramps down .",
    "in addition , a small fraction of binaries in which the  reaches @xmath4 can sustain mass transfer rates in the steady burning regime for most of the mass - transfer phase .",
    "( see , e.g. , van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ; rappaport , di  stefano & smith 1994 ; di  stefano & nelson 1996 ; yungelson et al .",
    "1996 ; l et al . 2006 ; han & podsiadlowski 2006 . )",
    "it is therefore possible that a portion of the observed ssss and qsss are co s on their way to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "it is important to identify candidates . given the expected temperature range , the nbwds that are 1  s could appear as very hot ssss .",
    "if there is a small hard component and/or if absorption is important , they could instead appear as the coolest of qsss . wherever possible ,",
    "these candidates should be monitored .",
    "those that are not high - mass nbwds will be interesting anyway , because they are unusual states of neutron - star or black - hole accretors . for example , some could be black holes of @xmath93 in thermal dominant states di  stefano et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "the candidates that turn out to be nbwds could be near explosion .",
    "the likelihood that an individual source is about to `` go off '' is small .",
    "even a  within @xmath94 may take more than @xmath5 years to achieve @xmath4 . nevertheless , by identifying a large pool of candidates , drawn from the hundreds of galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , we increase the chance of having a useful pre - explosion image of a 1  that explodes within the next decade .",
    "the restrictions on the numbers of ssss we have derived above do not necessarily translate into restrictions on the numbers of nbwds .",
    "in fact , theoretical considerations predict the presence of a population of high - mass nbwds .",
    "first , starting with a large population of binaries , a subset will pass through a phase in which a high - mass  accretes matter at a high rate ( see , e.g. , rappaport , di  stefano & smith 1994 ; yungelson et al .",
    "second , we know that 1e occur , and that every evolutionary pathway to explosion passes through channels that involve high accretion rates onto a  with mass larger than @xmath95 certainly a long phase of nuclear - burning is required in -d  models ( equation 3 ) .",
    "this would be true in sub - chandrasekhar models as well .",
    "furthermore , we show in the companion paper that even many -d  require a prior -d  phase during which nuclear burning is expected ( di  stefano 2009 ) .",
    "we have also found that the numbers of nbwds needed per galaxy is large .",
    "thus , at any given time , galaxies such as the milky way house @xmath96 nbwds with masses near @xmath0 in sub - chandrasekhar models , or -d  models the average mass of the nbwds may be smaller , but nevertheless larger than @xmath97 this increases our chances of establishing the existence of a population of s in m31 and in other nearby galaxies .",
    "perhaps most exciting , the large number guarantees that some s that are actively accreting nbwds must lie within a kpc of earth . if we can identify these , we will be able to make detailed studies of the s and the processes that allow high - mass s to grow in mass .",
    "in fact , we have almost certainly detected nbwds that are 1  s , in the milky way and in nearby galaxies .",
    "these must be bright systems .",
    "since the bulk of the energy produced by nuclear burning does not escape at x - ray wavelengths , it must be emitted in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "radiation from the  could , for example , be reprocessed by winds from the . in this case",
    ", the spectrum would be shifted toward longer wavelengths , and the s could be highly luminous in the ir . alternatively ,",
    "if the photospheres of massive nbwds tend to be large , compared with size of the , the power can be emitted primarily in the uv .",
    "if s pass through phases of sss behavior , even with a low duty cycle , they may be associated with large , distinctive ionization nebulae ( rappaport et al .",
    "1994 ; chiang & rappaport 1996 ; di  stefano , paerels & rappaport 1995 ) . in the companion paper ( di  stefano 2009 )",
    "we link the possible signatures of nuclear burning to the characteristics of the binary models for 1  s.    * summary : * nuclear burning appears to be required in order for type  ia supernovae to occur .",
    "as the companion paper shows , even many -d  s of 1e are expected to pass through an earlier -d  phase in which nuclear burning occurs .",
    "we have demonstrated that the majority of the s do not appear as ssss or qsss during most of the all - important nuclear - burning phase .",
    "the energy must escape in other wavebands , making it possible to detect and identify dozens of s in our own galaxy , and comparable or perhaps even larger numbers in m31 and other nearby galaxies . given the long duration of the requisite nuclear - burning phases , it would be surprising if some s do not appear as ssss or qsss , at least during part of their evolution .",
    "it is therefore still interesting to explore the connection between soft x - ray sources and 1  s , even as we extend searches to bright ir and uv sources , and large ionization nebulae , so as to find evidence of the centrally - important nuclear - burning phase .",
    "the bottom line is that , although 1e are rare and therefore tend to occur at great distance from us , thousands of the s are nearby , and are luminous enough that we can study them in detail well before they explode .",

    "<S> in a canonical model , the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are accreting , nuclear - burning white dwarfs ( nbwds ) , which explode when the white dwarf ( wd ) reaches the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath0 such massive nbwds are hot ( @xmath1 ev ) , luminous ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , and are potentially observable as luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) . during the past several years , surveys for soft x - ray sources in external galaxies have been conducted . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that the results falsify the hypothesis that a large fraction of progenitors are nbwds which are presently observable as ssss . </S>",
    "<S> the data also place limits on sub-@xmath4 models . </S>",
    "<S> while 1  s may pass through one or more phases of sss activity , these phases are far shorter than the time needed to accrete most of the matter that brings them close to @xmath0 </S>"
