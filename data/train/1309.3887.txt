    "intermediate- and high - mass stars are usually fast rotators . in some of these a- , b- and o - type stars , the @xmath1-mechanism excites eigenmodes . because of the centrifugal flattening of the star and the strength of the coriolis acceleration , the oscillation spectrum is much more complex than that of non - rotating stars .",
    "interpretation of observed frequencies of these stars requires two - dimensional models and their oscillation spectrum computed in a non - perturbative way . following the pioneering work of @xcite",
    ", we want to identify the observed modes of the fast - rotating star @xmath0 ophiuchi in order to better constrain its fundamental parameters .",
    "compared to the previous work of deupree , we improve the numerical resolution and get spectrally converged eigenfunctions that allow a reliable computation of visibilities and damping rates of the modes .",

    "its surface equatorial rotation velocity of 240 km@xmath4s@xmath5 imposes a flatness of 0.168 .",
    "its equatorial and polar radii have been derived from interferometry ( @xcite ) and the stellar mass is constrained by an orbiting companion ( @xcite ) . besides this , 57 oscillation frequencies have been measured by photometry ( @xcite ) . to reproduce the fitted radii , luminosity , polar and equatorial temperatures , our model uses @xmath6 , @xmath7 c / d , mass fractions @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the envelope , @xmath10 in the core ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenvalue problem of adiabatic oscillations is solved with the top code ( @xcite ) for modes with azimutal orders @xmath11 , in the range of frequencies in which the p modes are thought to be observed ( see figure [ fig : star ] ) .",

    ". these are g modes and p modes modified by rotation .",
    "g modes are the least - damped with large amplitude at the base of the envelope .",
    "their visibility is much less than that of the p modes that exist in this interval , as their amplitude is evanescent at the surface .",
    "however , p modes are much more damped .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figvis ] , where we clearly distinguish the set of g modes on the low - frequency side , each observed frequency corresponds to several eigenmodes of the model .",
    "the damping rates do not seem to be able to lift this degeneracy of the matching .",
    "it may well be that our models are at the moment too simple , notably because of the chemical homogeneity of the envelope .",
    "progress therefore calls for more realistic models that include the distribution of chemical elements resulting from time evolution ."
