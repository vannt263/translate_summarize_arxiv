    "light double @xmath0 hypernuclei are exotic few - body systems that provide an opportunity to investigate the @xmath8 flavor baryon - baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath9 channel  @xcite .",
    "they are also expected to play a key role in resolving the long - standing puzzle of the existence of the @xmath10 dibaryon  @xcite , which has recently been studied by lattice qcd simulations  @xcite",
    ". meanwhile @xmath8 flavor baryon - baryon potentials have been obtained in chiral effective theory , hyperon - nucleon potentials up to next - to - leading order  @xcite and hyperon - hyperon potentials at leading order ( lo )  @xcite assuming @xmath8 flavor symmetry except for the masses of mesons and baryons .",
    "the main difficulty of the study is that one does not have an adequate number of experimental data to accurately determine all parameters in the potentials . in this situation",
    ", it may be worth studying the exotic few - body systems by constructing a simple theory at very low energies which has a handful of parameters .    the first observation of @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ]",
    "was reported in the 1960s  @xcite , however there have been only a few reports on this light hypernucleus  @xcite . among them , a track of @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] was clearly caught in an emulsion experiment of the kek - e373 collaboration  @xcite , now known as the  nagara \" event , and the two-@xmath0 separation energy @xmath12 of @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] is estimated as @xmath13  mev after being averaged with that from the `` mikage '' event  @xcite . in addition , the formation of another light double-@xmath0 hypernucleus , @xmath1h , is conjectured in the bnl - ags e906 experiment  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies for the double @xmath0 hypernuclei mainly aim at extracting information on baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness sector and searching for new exotic systems for which the value of @xmath14 of @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] plays an important role  @xcite .",
    "in fact , studies of @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] have been reported with various issues in theory  @xcite , primarily employing the three - body ( @xmath4 ) cluster model .",
    "one of those issues is the importance of a mixing of the @xmath15 channel in the @xmath16 interaction because the relatively small mass difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels is about 23  mev ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in theoretical studies for @xmath17[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] , although the first faddeev - yakubovsky calculation showed a negative result  @xcite , subsequent theoretical studies  @xcite predicted the possibility of the @xmath1h bound state based on the phenomenological @xmath16 potentials which can describe the bound state of @xmath2he . in this article , we review the results of our recent works on the light double @xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath17[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] and @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] , as three - body @xmath3 and @xmath4 cluster systems , studied in halo / cluster effective field theories ( efts ) at lo  @xcite",
    ".    efts at very low energies are expected to provide a model - independent and systematic perturbative method where one introduces a high momentum separation scale @xmath18 between relevant degrees of freedom in low energy and irrelevant degrees of freedom in high energy for the system in question .",
    "then one constructs an effective lagrangian expanded in terms of the number of derivatives order by order .",
    "coupling constants appearing in the effective lagrangian should be determined from available experimental or empirical data . in the study of the three - body systems",
    ", we will make use of the cyclic singularities that arise in the solutions for the integral equations in the asymptotic limit  @xcite .",
    "such singularities are renormalized by introducing a suitably large momentum cutoff @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in the loop integrations at the cost of introducing three - body counter terms at lo . consequently , in order to absorb this cutoff dependence , the corresponding three - body coupling may exhibit a cyclic renormalization group ( rg ) evolution termed as the limit cycle  @xcite .",
    "the cyclic singularities are associated with the occurrence of bound states , known as the efimov states , in the resonant / unitary limit  @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein .    in our study for the three - body systems ,",
    "we first derive simple equations from the homogeneous part of the integral equations in the asymptotic limit to make an examination whether the systems exhibit a limit cycle or not .",
    "when a limit cycle does not appear in the system , it is not necessary to introduce a three - body contact interaction for renormalization at lo .",
    "the system would be insensitive to the three - body contact term and can be described by two - body interactions . in the spin-0 channel of the @xmath3 system , we shall see that a limit cycle does not appear and thus we can make a prediction on the scattering length @xmath5 for @xmath6-wave @xmath0 hyperon and hypertriton scattering using a parameter of a two - body interaction .",
    "when a limit cycle appears in the system , on the other hand , one needs to introduce a three - body contact interaction at lo . because the cyclic singularity is related to the occurrence of efimov states , the bound state emerging in the system",
    "can be regarded as an efimov state . in the study we vary the magnitude of the cutoff within a reasonable range , we investigate its effects on the formation of bound states and discuss whether the bound states of @xmath17[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] and @xmath11[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] can be efimov states or not .",

    "to construct an eft for @xmath17[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] as the @xmath3 system , we treat the deuteron field as a cluster field , i.e. , like an elementary field .",
    "thus the deuteron binding energy , @xmath21  mev , is chosen as the high energy scale .",
    "the large ( high momentum ) scale @xmath18 of the system is the deuteron binding momentum , @xmath22  mev , where @xmath23 is the nucleon mass .",

    "when the system exhibits the limit cycle , the three - body contact interaction is promoted to lo in order to renormalize the cyclic singularity emerging in the system .",
    "an effective lagrangian consists of relevant degrees of freedom at low energies , for which the most general terms are constructed based on symmetries of the mother theory , and is perturbatively expanded in terms of the number of derivatives  @xcite . because the typical momentum scales of the systems we consider are much smaller than the pion mass , the pions fields are considered to be heavy degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "in addition , instead of the chiral limit , the unitary limit can be chosen to describe the three - body systems  @xcite , in which bound states of the three - body systems can appear as the efimov states .",
    "while we do not take the unitary limit as lo in the present work , and thus all scattering lengths are finite .",

    "open squares are the results from the potential models in table 5 of ref .  @xcite . ]",

    "open squares are the estimated values from the potential models given in table 5 of ref .  .",
    "we find that the curves are sensitive to the cutoff values .",
    "when we choose @xmath203  mev , the curve for @xmath12 is found to be rather insensitive to @xmath204 . while the results from the potential models are remarkably well reproduced by the curve with @xmath205  mev .",
    "in this article we reviewed the results of our recent works on the light double @xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath1h and @xmath2he , as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 three - body systems investigated in halo / cluster eft at lo  @xcite .",
    "we obtained the equations from the integral equations in the asymptotic limit to make a simple examination whether the systems exhibit a limit cycle or not .",
    "when a limit cycle does not appear in the three - body system , it is not necessary to introduce a three - body contact interaction and the system can be described by the two - body interaction .",
    "thus we estimate the scattering length @xmath5 for the @xmath6-wave @xmath0 hyperon and hypertriton scattering in the spin-0 channel without an unknown parameter .",
    "our theoretical prediction is @xmath7  fm .",
    "though our result can not be tested due to the lack of any experimental datum , the similar case , the @xmath6-wave @xmath206 scattering in the spin - quartet channel , may give a positive indication that the theory has a prediction power in the channel without exhibiting the limit cycle .",
    "in the three - nucleon system a limit cycle does not appear either and the scattering length and the phase shift below the deuteron breakup threshold are well described without a three - body contact interaction  @xcite .",
    "the scattering length @xmath207 is obtained in pionless eft as @xmath208  fm  @xcite which is in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath209  fm  @xcite .",
    "when the limit cycle appears in the system , it is necessary to introduce the three - body contact interaction for renormalization , and the bound states appearing in the system may sometimes be regarded as an efimov state . for the @xmath3 system in the spin-1 channel , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig;g1vslam ] , the bound state of @xmath1h can be formed due to the three - body contact interaction , which stems from the physics at the high energies , in the range of the cutoff value up to @xmath210  mev .",
    "the bound state can be formed without the three - body contact interaction when the cutoff value becomes larger than @xmath211  mev .",
    "the value is extremely large compared to the hard scale of the @xmath3 system , @xmath212  mev .",
    "thus it is hard to regard that of @xmath1h as an efimov state .",
    "on the other hand , the bound state of the @xmath4 system , @xmath2he , can be formed by choosing the value of the cutoff as @xmath213  mev without introducing the three - body contact interaction where the range of the cutoff dependence comes out of the uncertainty of @xmath58 .",
    "that is comparable to the hard scale of the system , @xmath132  mev .",
    "thus the bound state for @xmath2he formed at the first cycle of the limit cycle would be regarded as an efimov state .",
    "another example for the formation of an efimov state in the three - body system is the triton . in pionless eft calculations , the bound state of the three - nucleon system",
    "is formed without introducing the three - body contact interaction when one chooses @xmath214  mev  @xcite .",
    "that is also comparable to the hard scale of the pionless eft , @xmath215  mev .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the systems can be described by a small number of the parameters in the very low energy efts .",
    "there is only one parameter for the @xmath3 system in the spin-0 channel , whereas there are three for the @xmath3 system in the spin-1 channel and the @xmath216 system in the spin-0 system . in addition , each of the three - body systems is characterized by the typical and hard scales and the presence or absence of the limit cycle .",
    "this is a simple analysis but may provide us nontrivial information and knowledge about the systems .",
    "it may be interesting to apply the analysis carried out in the present article to the study of an exotic bound state arising from other three - body systems   system  @xcite . ] .",
    "it may be worth discussing the role of the cutoff value in the systems .",
    "can be arbitrary when renormalizing an on - shell physical quantity of the three - body system .",
    "( while we may take the value of @xmath19 to be smaller than a value at which an unphysical deeply bound state is formed . ) in this work , to assure the consistency between the effective degrees of freedom and the off - shell probe of the loop momentum , we assume @xmath217 . ] as mentioned , the correlations between @xmath12 and @xmath58 obtained from the potential models are well reproduced in both the @xmath1h and @xmath2he states when we choose @xmath169  mev .",
    "it may indicate that our simple theory can probe the scale of the @xmath16 interactions of the potential model calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is consistent to the scale for the long range part of the @xmath16 interaction which consists of the two - pion - exchange , @xmath218  mev . with such a momentum cutoff , however , the two nucleon structure of the deuteron and the existence of the excited state of the @xmath31 particle can be probed in the loops . because our efts at very low energies do not have such detailed structures , the short range structural mechanism is missing in that case .",
    "such an inconsistency is in fact common in the cluster model calculations .",
    "when we strictly choose the cutoff @xmath19 to be the hard scale of the systems , @xmath219  mev for the @xmath3 system and @xmath220  mev for the @xmath4 system , on the other hand , the curves for @xmath12 are less sensitive to @xmath58 , compared to the potential models , in figs .",
    "[ fig;bllvsall ] and [ fig;bll6vsall ] , respectively .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath16 two - body part with the different cutoff value is eventually compensated by the three - body contact interaction after the renormalization of the three - body quantity in each of the systems . in addition , the scale of @xmath204 is @xmath221  mev , which is comparable to the hard scales of the systems .",
    "thus some portion of the @xmath16 interaction is carried by the three - body contact term in the very low energy efts and is not easily disentangled from it .",
