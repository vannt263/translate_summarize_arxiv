    "during the past two decades considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the spontaneous emergence of patterns in spatially - extended non - equilibrium systems .",
    "the existence of simple spatial or spatio - temporal patterns has been rigorously established on the basis of equivariant bifurcation theory ( see  @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , these simple patterns are often unstable in a given system , which evolves instead to a state of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "patterns that result from a symmetry - breaking hopf bifurcation seem to be especially vulnerable to instability .",
    "a current challenge in pattern - formation research is to develop control schemes that stabilize the simple patterned states , so that a desired , otherwise unstable , solution may be realized .",
    "this paper extends current research on feedback control of oscillatory patterns , focusing on traveling wave solutions of the two - dimensional complex ginzburg  landau equation .",
    "one of the goals of this line of research is to develop control algorithms that exploit the underlying symmetries of a targeted pattern in order to stabilize it in a non - invasive fashion .",
    "that is , if the pattern is invariant under some spatial , temporal or spatio - temporal transformation , then it may be possible to construct a feedback based on this transformation which vanishes when the target pattern is achieved .",
    "for example , if the pattern has the property that @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some euclidean transformation of the spatial variable , and @xmath2 is a possible time delay , then a feedback which is proportional to @xmath3 will be non - invasive .",
    "ott , grebogi and yorke  @xcite were the first to develop a control algorithm that suppresses chaos in favor of a simple unstable periodic orbit ( upo ) in low - degree - of - freedom chaotic systems . in this approach ,",
    "small perturbations are applied to a system parameter in order to keep the system close to the upo .",
    "however , this method requires constant monitoring of the system , and also may not be effective in rapidly evolving systems .",
    "pyragas  @xcite introduced a second approach , sometimes called ` time - delayed autosynchronisation ' ( tdas ) , in which the feedback is proportional to the difference between the current and a past state of the system .",
    "that is , the feedback is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the period of the desired upo , and @xmath6 is some state variable .",
    "this method has a number of attractive properties .",
    "first , the upo of the original system will also be a solution of the system with feedback , and so control may be achieved in a non - invasive manner .",
    "second , the only information required a priori is the period of the desired upo .",
    "the method has been implemented successfully in a variety of laboratory experiments on electronic @xcite , laser @xcite , plasma @xcite , mechanical  @xcite and chemical systems @xcite ; more examples can be found in a recent review by pyragas  @xcite .",
    "an extension of tdas proposed by socolar  @xcite incorporates information at many previous times and is known as ` extended time - delayed autosynchronisation ' ( etdas ) .",
    "this method was used by bleich and socolar  @xcite to stabilize unstable traveling wave solutions of the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgle ) in one spatial dimension . for spatially - extended pattern - forming systems ,",
    "other proposed modifications of the time - delay autosynchronization scheme of pyragas include _ global _ feedback control  @xcite , where the magnitude of the feedback depends on some spatial average , or maximum , of a quantity at an earlier time .",
    "yet others take into account the spatial periodicity , as well as temporal periodicity , of the targeted pattern . for instance , lu , yu and harrison  @xcite used numerical simulations of the two - dimensional maxwell ",
    "bloch equations describing a three - level laser system to demonstrate that spatio - temporal chaos could be suppressed by applying a linear combination of time - delay feedback and an analogous spatially - translated feedback term of the form : @xmath7+[e(x , y+y_0,t)-e(x , y , t)]\\}. \\nonumber\\ ] ] here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are translation vectors associated with the feedback ; the feedback is non - invasive when the resulting pattern is periodic in each of the @xmath10-directions , with spatial periods @xmath11 .",
    "their numerical investigations reveal that these two spatial controls somehow select the direction of travel of the stabilized plane wave .",
    "this type of feedback , with a combination of temporal and spatial terms , was extensively studied by montgomery and silber  @xcite in the context of the one - dimensional cgle .",
    "the aim of our paper is to extend the results of  @xcite to the cgle in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this problem is interesting since harrington and socolar  @xcite have shown that unstable traveling waves in the 2d cgle _ can not _ be stabilized using only temporal feedback , due to the presence of torsion - free modes ( that is , modes which have purely real floquet multipliers ) .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by using a combination of temporal and spatial terms , as in  @xcite , and additionally consider the effect of having either one or two spatially shifted terms in order to steer the direction of the traveling waves in the plane .    our analysis is based on a linear stability analysis of the traveling wave solutions of the cgle .",
    "the analysis leads to a system of delay differential equations ( see  @xcite for more on ddes ) .",
    "we find stability boundaries by searching for critical curves / surfaces of hopf bifurcations within the system of ddes .",
    "the analysis is made possible because the cgle admits an exact family of solutions in the form of a traveling plane waves @xmath12 , parameterized by the wave vector @xmath13 . for this problem",
    "the dispersion relation that relates @xmath14 and @xmath15 is known precisely .",
    "we expect that our methods could equally well be applied to other spatially extended systems for which traveling plane waves exist .",
    "such solutions arise for instance when a spatially - uniform solution undergoes a hopf bifurcation .",
    "however , in many instances , the form of the wave and the dispersion relation are unknown , or known only approximately . in this case , we propose that just one spatial term be incorporated in the feedback , and consider target waves that travel in a direction relative to this feedback term so that both the temporal and spatial feedback terms vanish . in this way",
    "the wavenumber and frequency of the plane wave can be matched even when the dispersion relation is unknown , although the direction of travel must be left free .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we review some properties of the cgle and the feedback we are applying , and in section  [ sec : prev ] we describe previously known results regarding these systems . in section",
    "[ sec : spfe ] we discuss the effects of additional spatial feedback and how the spatial shifts must be chosen in order to stabilize the wave .",
    "section  [ sec : anal ] contains a geometric way to think about the results of  @xcite and in section  [ sec : num ] we provide a numerical example to demonstrate our results .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    "in this section we review some properties of traveling wave solutions of the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgle ) .",
    "the cgle is an amplitude equation for some disturbance @xmath16 in a spatially extended system near the onset of a hopf bifurcation that sets in with zero wavenumber , _",
    "i.e. _ a spatially  uniform oscillatory instability .",
    "after appropriate rescalings and in a frame that is oscillating at the hopf frequency , it can be written generically as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real parameters .",
    "we consider only the situation just after a supercritical hopf bifurcation , so the coefficient of the linear term is positive ( and has been rescaled to equal unity ) and the parameter @xmath19 is assumed to be positive . in this paper , we consider the spatial extent of the problem to be two - dimensional , so @xmath20 .",
    "we consider traveling wave solutions of the form @xmath21 where the amplitude @xmath22 and frequency @xmath15 are determined by the wavenumber @xmath23 through the relations @xmath24 since @xmath25 it follows from   that @xmath26 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath27 .    in the benjamin  feir unstable regime ( @xmath28 ) all solutions of the form   are unstable .",
    "in this paper we investigate how the addition of feedback terms to   affects the linear stability of these solutions in this regime .",
    "specifically we consider @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a feedback term given by @xmath31+\\sum_{j=1}^n\\rho_j[a({\\mathbf{x}}+\\delta     { \\mathbf{x}}_j , t)-a({\\mathbf{x}},t)].\\ ] ] the delay parameter @xmath5 is positive , and we restrict our analysis to the case where @xmath32 ( the gain ) and @xmath33 are real .",
    "we consider the two cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that is , the feedback @xmath30 can contain either one or two spatially - shifted feedback terms .    in this paper , we study the stability of traveling waves for which the feedback terms vanish .",
    "we choose the spatial and temporal shifts @xmath36 and @xmath5 such that @xmath37 for a specific targeted traveling wave of the form  , with wavevector @xmath38 and frequency @xmath15 .    there may be many other solutions to   for which the feedback term does not vanish .",
    "we do not study these solutions in this paper - our analysis is a purely local stability analysis assuming we are already close to the targeted wave .",
    "since we know the dispersion relation   relating the wave frequency @xmath15 and the wavenumber @xmath23 , the spatial and temporal shifts are related and can not be chosen independently .",
    "we now consider how the shifts must be chosen in the two cases @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that if we were to choose @xmath39 , there would be some relations between the @xmath36 in order that they satisfy  .",
    "for instance , for @xmath40 , we would need @xmath41 for some integers @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is because we are in two spatial dimensions .",
    "we do not consider the cases of higher @xmath44 here , but it may be that using additional shifted terms can increase the region of stability of the traveling waves , much in the same way as etdas  @xcite .    for @xmath35 , we insist that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not parallel ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "then for specified @xmath45 and @xmath46 there is a two - dimensional dual lattice of possible target wavevectors @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice generators @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfy @xmath50    the frequency of the desired wave is specified by the choice of @xmath51 , which must be consistent with the choice of @xmath13 , since the frequency and wavenumber are related _ a priori _ by the dispersion relation  .",
    "( this ` overspecification ' of the targeted wave is analogous to the one - dimensional case of  @xcite , where one temporal and one spatial term select @xmath15 and @xmath52 which are already related by the dispersion relation . )",
    "note that if @xmath13 lies on the lattice , so also does @xmath53 , and thus the direction ( right / left ) of travel of the wave is not selected .",
    "if the same procedure were repeated for a different amplitude equation for which the dispersion relation were not known , then in the ` overspecified ' @xmath35 case there could be a discrepancy between the temporal and spatial feedback terms , and it may not be possible for both to vanish .",
    "however , in the case @xmath34 , there is more freedom , as we explain below .    for @xmath34",
    "it is not possible to choose @xmath45 such that the spatially - shifted term targets a single traveling wave .",
    "that is , for a given @xmath42 , there is a continuum of wavevectors @xmath13 for which @xmath54 and the spatial feedback term vanishes .",
    "the possible target @xmath13 for a given @xmath45 are indicated by the bold lines in figure  [ fig:1dx ] , in section  [ sec : spfe ] .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath5 selects some @xmath15 , and hence @xmath14 is also selected , by the dispersion relation .",
    "the direction of @xmath13 ( again , up to a sign ) is selected by the spatially shifted term , and so a single traveling wave can be targeted .",
    "this is explained in more detail in section  [ sec : n1 ] .",
    "note that @xmath30 can only improve the stability of the traveling waves if @xmath55 and likewise @xmath56 . the reasons for this",
    "are explained in detail in  @xcite and we will only consider this parameter regime .",
    "the linear stability of traveling waves   is calculated by considering the effect of small amplitude perturbations , for some perturbation wavevector @xmath57 .",
    "we write @xmath58 substitute into   and linearize in @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this results in a system of delay differential equations for @xmath59 and the complex conjugate of @xmath60 ( denoted by @xmath61 ) : @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in the following sections we review previous results concerning feedback control in equations similar to   and then present our new results",
    "our stability analysis builds on results of harrington and socolar  @xcite , nakajima  @xcite and montgomery and silber  @xcite . for completeness , in this section we give a summary of the results of  @xcite and  @xcite , and also of previously known results concerning some instabilities of the cgle without feedback .",
    "we discuss details of  @xcite in section  [ sec : anal ] .      in the absence of any feedback terms ( i.e.  @xmath67 ) , traveling waves are stable to perturbations with wavevector",
    "@xmath68 if both eigenvalues of the jacobian   have negative real part .",
    "the benjamin  feir ( b  f ) instability is a long wavelength instability , that is , perturbations with @xmath66 sufficiently small will grow . in the limit @xmath69",
    ", a simple calculation shows that one eigenvalue of @xmath70 always has negative real part , and the other has real part equal to : @xmath71 hence , if @xmath28 ( the b  f unstable regime ) , then this is positive for all @xmath13 , and long wavelength perturbations will grow .",
    "a second type of instability important to our subsequent analysis , is associated with perturbations with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 no longer necessarily small ) .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that these perturbations grow for small enough @xmath73 , that is , those with @xmath74 perturbations with @xmath72 and @xmath75 decay .    when @xmath73 is sufficiently large , the eigenvalues of @xmath76 , so all sufficiently shortwave perturbations will decay .",
    "however , there may be other regions of unstable @xmath68 in addition to those described above .",
    "we now summarize a result from harrington and socolar  @xcite concerning the stabilization of plane waves in the 2d cgle with only temporal feedback .",
    "their result relies on a proof of nakajima  @xcite which has recently  @xcite been shown to be incorrect . however , as we discuss below , the result of nakajima does still hold in some cases , and the results of  @xcite are still correct .",
    "the claim of nakajima is as follows .",
    "suppose an ode @xmath77 contains an unstable periodic orbit , @xmath78 , with period @xmath79 .",
    "feedback is added to   so it is now of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an @xmath82 gain matrix .",
    "then if the linearization of   about the orbit @xmath78 has an odd number of positive , real unstable floquet multipliers then there is no value of @xmath81 for which @xmath78 is a stable solution of  .",
    "the flaw in the proof of nakajima is that the neutral floquet multiplier associated with perturbations in the direction of the periodic orbit was neglected .",
    "however , in both the example of harrington and socolar , and in our work , the analysis of the stability of the traveling wave has been reduced to the study of the stability of a fixed point ( namely , the zero solution to the linear dde  ) .",
    "the result of nakajima _ can _ be applied to hyperbolic fixed points , since they do not have a trivial floquet multiplier , and so the results of  @xcite still stand .",
    "( a similar result for fixed points in maps , rather than flows , is given by ushio  @xcite . ) in our examples , the perturbation along the periodic orbit which yields a neutral floquet multiplier is associated with a perturbation with wavevector @xmath83 .",
    "it is not this type of perturbation we are concerned with in the following .",
    "the result of harrington and socolar is summarized as follows .",
    "consider   with no spatial feedback , that is , @xmath84 . in 2d",
    "there always exists an unstable perturbation wavenumber @xmath68 which satisfies @xmath72 . in this situation ,",
    "the jacobian @xmath70 is equal to @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath87 , then @xmath70 has real trace and real , negative determinant , hence has real eigenvalues of opposite sign .",
    "note that in only one spatial dimension , we can only have @xmath88 if either @xmath83 or @xmath89 , so the same result does not apply .",
    "the ` flat ' perturbations with @xmath83 do not cause instabilities for @xmath90 , which is the parameter range we are interested in .",
    "in this section we extend the results described above to include the effects of additional spatial feedback , with either one or two spatial terms .",
    "this section is organized as follows .",
    "first , we show that there are some perturbation wavevectors @xmath68 which are unaffected by the spatial feedback .",
    "we then discuss how the displacements @xmath36 must be chosen to target a particular wavevector @xmath13 , for both the cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "consider the jacobian matrix @xmath70 given in  . if the perturbation wavevector @xmath68 satisfies @xmath91 , for some @xmath92 , then @xmath70 is the same as if @xmath84",
    ". hence , these perturbations @xmath68 are not affected by the spatial feedback .",
    "combining this with the results of harrington and socolar  @xcite described in the previous section , if these @xmath68 are unstable for the system with no feedback , and additionally satisfy @xmath72 , then the traveling waves can not be stabilized for any values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 . that is , if there is a @xmath93 which satisfies @xmath94 then the traveling waves can not be stabilized .    if there are no such @xmath68 , then it is possible that there exists some choice of @xmath33 and @xmath32 for which the traveling wave is stable .",
    "recall that in order for the spatial feedback to vanish at the targeted wave solution , we require that @xmath95 in one spatial dimension , this gives a unique choice of @xmath36 ( for say , @xmath96 ) for a given @xmath13 , but in two spatial dimensions this is not the case .",
    "we now discuss this further .      for @xmath34",
    "there is a continuum of wavevectors @xmath13 for which @xmath54 and the feedback term vanishes .",
    "the possible @xmath13 are indicated by the bold straight lines in figure  [ fig:1dx ] .",
    "however , isolated @xmath13 can be picked out from this continuum by the temporal feedback term ( which fixes @xmath5 and hence @xmath15 ) and the dispersion relation .",
    "the dispersion relation fixes @xmath97 for a given @xmath15 and so gives a circle of possible wavevectors .",
    "if we let @xmath98 for some integer @xmath99 , then this will give a family of circles , of decreasing @xmath52 as @xmath100 increases ( since @xmath52 must decrease as @xmath15 increases ) , however , we only consider @xmath101 .",
    "the intersection of this circle and the straight lines in figure  [ fig:1dx ] give the possible @xmath13 for which the feedback term vanishes . in this example , there are three possible @xmath13 ( up to a sign ) . as we explain below , the @xmath13 with direction closest to that of @xmath45 will be the easiest to stabilize .",
    "however , it is certainly possible that more than one of these @xmath13 may be simultaneously stabilized .",
    "if the dispersion relation for a system is known , as is the case for the cgle , then the location of this circle is known , and @xmath5 and @xmath45 can be chosen to target a particular traveling wave . if the dispersion relation is not known , then the location of the circle is not known , but it still exists . in this case , we can , say , choose @xmath5 to pick the frequency of the target wave , and also pick some @xmath45 .",
    "we will not be able to choose in advance the wavevector @xmath13 of the resulting targeted wave , but the possible @xmath13 for which the feedback vanishes will be isolated in @xmath13-space .",
    "this method provides us with a possible mechanism for using this stabilization scheme for a system in which the dispersion relation is not known .",
    "if there is a @xmath68 which satisfies  , it will also lie on the bold lines in figure  [ fig:1dx ] .",
    "however , for a given @xmath13 , @xmath45 can be chosen in such a way that there are no @xmath68 which satisfy the resonance conditions  . to see this ,",
    "consider the situation where @xmath45 is chosen to be almost parallel to @xmath13 , then the only @xmath68 perpendicular to @xmath13 which also lie on the bold lines will have a very large magnitude and hence do not correspond to wavenumbers of destabilizing perturbations .",
    "once @xmath45 is chosen to avoid the resonance conditions   the methods developed in  @xcite can then be used to determine the stability of the traveling waves .    by analogy with the one - dimensional case",
    ", we might hope that we are able to stabilize the wave for which @xmath13 and @xmath45 are parallel ( indicated by @xmath102 on figure  [ fig:1dx ] ) .",
    "however , this is not the case since there always exist unstable longwave perturbations ( @xmath73 small ) which satisfy @xmath103 , and these perturbations are unaffected by the spatial feedback .",
    "hence this plane wave can not be stabilized in this fashion .      for the spatial feedback with two terms to vanish at the targeted wave solution",
    ", @xmath13 must satisfy @xmath104 this gives a lattice of possible target wavevectors with generators as given in equation  .",
    "an example lattice is shown in figure  [ fig : klat ] .",
    "recall that for the cgle we must have @xmath105 , so for a given target @xmath13 , it is possible to choose @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath13 and @xmath106 are the only non - trivial lattice points inside the unit circle .",
    "however , for a specific choice of @xmath13 , the choice of @xmath45 and @xmath46 resulting in an appropriate lattice is not unique .",
    "the perturbations @xmath68 which satisfy   will lie on the same lattice as @xmath13",
    ". if @xmath107 is small enough , there will be no unstable @xmath68 ( that is , with @xmath108 ) which lie on the lattice .",
    "therefore , so long as @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen appropriately , the theorem of nakajima does not apply .",
    "the methods developed in  @xcite can then be used to determine the regions of stability for these waves . in the next section we review the approach taken in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss a result found in montgomery and silber  @xcite .",
    "they show that for the cgle in 1d with feedback as in  , the ` best ' choice of @xmath32 is @xmath109 .",
    "that is , if it is possible to stabilize a traveling wave for some choice of feedback parameters , this can certainly be achieved by choosing @xmath110 .    the proof given in  @xcite",
    "can be extended to two dimensions .",
    "here we omit those details and give a briefer , and more intuitive reason as to why their result holds , although it is not rigorous .",
    "we first reduce the delay differential equation   to a single equation by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath70 to give @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are appropriate linear combinations of @xmath59 and @xmath114 , and @xmath115 the @xmath116 are the eigenvalues of the jacobian   with no feedback ( that is , @xmath117 ) , with @xmath118 . as described in  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath113 equation does not affect the stability boundary since it is associated with the more stable eigenvalue .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the @xmath112 equation , and write @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are real functions of @xmath68 .",
    "hence , @xmath122 is the largest real part of the eigenvalues of @xmath70 when there is no temporal feedback . since the feedback can only improve the stability of the traveling waves , instabilities are only possible when @xmath123 .",
    "critical surfaces describing the boundaries between regions of stable and unstable perturbations have @xmath124 with @xmath125 , @xmath126 ( i.e.  they are points of hopf bifurcations since @xmath127 ) .",
    "we can write equations for these surfaces in @xmath32-@xmath68 space , parameterized by @xmath128 , as : @xmath129 the results of  @xcite can be used to give an algebraic condition for the stability of the traveling waves .",
    "that is , if there are no solutions @xmath128 , @xmath68 to the equations @xmath130 then the traveling wave can be stabilized at @xmath110 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gammaq ] we give a sketch of the shape of the curves given by   and   for a fixed direction of @xmath68 , in two cases , one before and one after a change of stability of the traveling waves . at points with @xmath131 , the curves either intersect @xmath132 ( if @xmath133 ) , or asymptote to @xmath134 ( when @xmath135 ) .",
    "these curves divide regions of stable and unstable perturbations . for a traveling wave to be stable , it must be stable for all perturbations @xmath68 .",
    "one mechanism by which the stability of a traveling wave can change is for two critical curves to collide at points with @xmath136 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammaq ] shows a schematic of this transition .",
    "of course , the stability of the wave could also hypothetically change without the two curves in the right hand picture of figure  [ fig : gammaq ] colliding ; the minimum of the top curve would just have to extend below the maximum of the lower curve .",
    "we do not consider this mechanism of stability change here , but it is covered by the analysis in  @xcite .    hence , we wish to identify points on the critical curves which have @xmath136 , since it is at these points that the surfaces can collide and change the stability of the traveling waves .",
    "differentiating   and   with respect to @xmath32 , and setting @xmath136 gives : @xmath137 eliminating @xmath138 results in @xmath139 when @xmath140 , the critical curves asymptote to @xmath134 , @xmath131 , so the only turning points with @xmath136 will be at @xmath141 , which is the value identified as optimal in  @xcite .",
    "we now give two numerical examples to show that there are regions of parameter space in which traveling waves can be stabilized using the methods described above .",
    "the first example we give can be stabilized for @xmath35 but not , for the parameters we use , for @xmath34 .",
    "the second example can be stabilized for @xmath34 .",
    "we also demonstrate the way in which stability of the traveling wave is lost , as described above - two critical surfaces collide at @xmath110 .",
    "we used the matlab package dde - biftool  @xcite to analyze the linearized system   and search for hopf bifurcations in order to locate the critical surfaces between stable and unstable perturbations in @xmath32-@xmath68 space . for our first example , the parameters used are @xmath142 , @xmath143 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath13 to be parallel to the @xmath144-axis .",
    "the spatial shifts @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen to be parallel to the vector @xmath145 and @xmath13 respectively , and also to satisfy @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "we choose @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "recall that the wave can not be stabilized if there exist unstable perturbations with @xmath72 and @xmath150 . in this example , @xmath151 and it is simple to check in each case that there are no such @xmath68 with @xmath108 .",
    "the contour plots of @xmath122 in figure  [ fig : alpha ] show the regions of @xmath68-space in which it is possible to find instabilities - that is , those regions where @xmath123 .",
    "note that there is a symmetry @xmath152 . in the case @xmath34",
    "there are two disjoint regions , but for @xmath35 there is only one . if there were no temporal feedback ( i.e.  @xmath132 ) , then the traveling wave would be unstable . in this example",
    "it is not possible to suppress all the instabilities using just the spatial feedback ; figure  [ fig : alpha](d ) has spatial feedback ten times that of ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the @xmath68 which are still unstable are centered around points which satisfy @xmath153 for some @xmath154 , so the terms proportional to @xmath33 in   vanish ( i.e.  these @xmath68 are unaffected by the spatial feedback ) .",

    "we now give more details on the addition of temporal feedback to the two cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "parameters are chosen as described above .",
    "we consider two values of @xmath13 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 . in both cases , the value of @xmath158 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hopf_surfsn2 ] shows bifurcation surfaces for the two cases . in the first case , the surfaces are disjoint and so the traveling wave can be stabilized for a range of choices of @xmath32 , which include @xmath109 . in the second case , the two surfaces have joined , and there is no choice of @xmath32 for which all @xmath68 perturbations are stable .",
    "figure  [ fig : fm_n2 ] shows the real part of the floquet exponents of the linearized system at @xmath110 .",
    "we can see that for @xmath159 , the growth rates are negative for all @xmath68 , so the traveling wave is stable . for @xmath160 , there are two ( symmetry - related ) regions in the @xmath68-plane which have positive growth rates and hence the traveling wave is unstable .",
    "we now investigate whether the traveling waves can be stabilized using only one spatially shifted term .",
    "we first investigate the same example as used above for @xmath35 , but only use the spatial shift @xmath45 which is parallel to the vector @xmath145 .",
    "( note that we can not use only the second spatial shift @xmath46 since it is parallel to @xmath13 . )",
    "figure  [ fig : fm_n1 ] shows the real part of the floquet exponents of the linearized system at @xmath110 for this case , for two values of @xmath14 .",
    "note that there are more regions of instability in the @xmath34 case than the @xmath35 case .",
    "the instability at @xmath161 is present in both cases , and is suppressed as @xmath14 is varied . however , in the @xmath34 case , there are additional regions of unstable @xmath68 which are not stabilized at these parameter values .",
    "figure  [ fig : fm_n1_stab ] shows the real part of the floquet exponents for a second parameter set , for which the wave can be stabilized using only one spatially shifted term .",
    "in this second example , all parameters are the same except that the spatial shift @xmath45 is parallel to the vector @xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",
    "the two plots show the real parts of the exponents of the linearized system with and without the temporal feedback ( that is , @xmath132 and @xmath164 ) .",
    "there are no positive growth rates when @xmath110 and hence the traveling wave can be stabilized .",
    "in this paper we have examined the possibility of stabilizing traveling waves of the cgle in two spatial dimensions using a combination of both temporal and spatial feedback .",
    "the feedback is noninvasive , in that it vanishes at the targeted wave solution , and is a generalization of that first proposed by pyragas  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is a local linear stability analysis which involves the study of a linear delay equation .",
    "the analysis is similar to that in  @xcite , for the 1d cgle .",
    "however , in the 2d case , the spatial shifts @xmath36 must be carefully chosen as otherwise there may be some perturbations @xmath68 which are unaffected by the spatial feedback , meaning the wave can not be stabilized for any values of the control parameters .",
    "we show that if the @xmath36 are correctly chosen , the results of  @xcite that the ` best ' value of the gain is @xmath110 still holds .",
    "we expect that this method of using noninvasive feedback to stabilize otherwise unstable waves could also be applied to amplitude equations other than the cgle .",
    "one property of the cgle which simplifies the analysis is that the form of the wave and its dispersion relation can be written down in closed form , and are particularly simple . for other amplitude equations",
    "this will not be the case .",
    "a lack of knowledge of the dispersion relation means that it is not possible to choose _ a priori _ the time delay and two spatial shifts in a consistent way so that all temporal and spatial feedback terms vanish simultaneously .",
    "it may be possible , however , to circumvent this difficulty if just one spatial term and one temporal delay term are employed in the feedback ; a single wave may then satisfy the criterion that the feedback vanish when it is realized .",
    "however , the unknown dispersion relation will then be selecting its direction of travel .    in our analysis",
    ", we assumed the feedback parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 were real .",
    "this is a mathematically convenient choice since the control matrix then ends up being a multiple of the identity .",
    "however , the choice of _ real _ gain coefficients for the control terms does not seem natural when all other coefficients in the _ complex _ ginzburg  landau equation are complex .",
    "future work on this problem will consider the case of complex gain parameters .",
