    "@xcite . our second order condition ( [ defl ] )",
    "is rather mild when compared to examples from the literature ; cf .  @xcite . as will be explained in section  [ 32 ] ,",
    "a more general formulation seems to be impossible .",
    "let us point out two main conceptual results of this paper .",
    "first , we wish to extend the existing theory beyond the limitation @xmath61 imposed by locally constant or linear approximations and to have a clear notion of stochastic and deterministic error for the nonlinear estimators . to this end",
    "we develop a linear program in terms of general local polynomials , based on a quasi - likelihood method , because the definition in hall and van keilegom  @xcite does not extend to polynomials of degree  2 or more in our setup",
    ". then theorem  [ teocon ] below yields for the estimator a nontrivial decomposition in approximation and stochastic error .",
    "this decomposition is a key result for our analysis , and permits us to address the adaptation problem in full generality , thus abolishing the blockade mentioned in hall and park  @xcite .",
    "we can consider not only pointwise , but also the global @xmath27-norm as risk measure for the whole range @xmath62 .",
    "technically , the optimal @xmath27-adaptation is much more demanding compared to the pointwise risk .",
    "it requires very tight deviation bounds since no additional @xmath63-factor widens the margin .    for adaptive bandwidth selection , we apply a nested variant of thelepski  @xcite procedure with pre - estimated critical values .",
    "careful adaptive pre - estimation is necessary since the distribution of @xmath5 is unknown and allowed to vary in @xmath42 .",
    "the fact that the underlying sample @xmath64 is inhomogeneously shifted by @xmath0 adds another level of complexity for the estimationof @xmath60 and @xmath65 , which needs to be addressed by translation invariant estimators .",
    "the remarkable result of theorem  [ tl2upperbound ] is that for general @xmath27-losswe obtain the rate @xmath66 of convergence , the same as in the case of known ( global ) hlder regularity @xmath16 and knowndistribution of @xmath5 . for pointwise loss",
    "the rate deteriorates to@xmath67 ; see theorem  [ tpointwise ] below .",
    "in section  [ seclowerbounds ] it is shown that all our rates are minimax optimal for adaptive estimation . for regular mean regression these rates , inserting @xmath68 and @xmath58 , and particularly the payment for adaptation on @xmath69 under pointwise loss are well known . a priori it is , however , not at all obvious that in the nonregular case with poisson limit experiments ( meister and reiss  @xcite ) exactly the same factor appears .",
    "interestingly , we do not pay in the convergence rates for not knowing @xmath60 , @xmath65 .",
    "the lower bound in the `` default - type boundary '' case @xmath70 with slower rates than in regular regression requires a completely new strategy of proof where not only alternatives for the regression function , but also for the error distributions are tested against each other .    in section",
    "[ 5 ] we provide some numerical simulations in order to evaluate the finite sample performance of the estimator .",
    "smaller values in @xmath60 indeed lead to significantly improved estimation results .",
    "the bandwidth selection shows a quite different behavior from the regular regression case due to taking local extremes .",
    "applications to empirical data from sunspot observations and annual best running times on 1500  m are presented .",
    "most proofs are deferred to section  [ 6 ] , and auxiliary lemmas and details regarding the sharpness estimation are given in the supplementary material  @xcite .",
    "our approach is a local polynomial estimation based on local extreme value statistics .",
    "we fix some @xmath71 $ ] and consider the coefficients @xmath72 which minimize the objective function @xmath73 under the constraints @xmath74 for all @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "set @xmath77 . as an estimator of @xmath0",
    "we define @xmath78,\\ ] ] where the bandwidth @xmath79 remains to be selected .",
    "if @xmath80 is exponentially distributed and the regression function a polynomial of maximal degree @xmath81 on the interval @xmath82 $ ] , then @xmath83 is the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) , whence the approach can be seen as a local quasi - mle method ; see also knight  @xcite .",
    "the idea of local polynomial estimators in frontier estimation was already employed , for instance , in hall et al .",
    "@xcite , hall and park  @xcite and hall and van keilegom  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to their local linear estimators ( and their higher order extensions ) , the sum over the evaluations at @xmath84 in the neighborhood of @xmath18 is minimized instead of the area .",
    "this marks a substantial difference and is crucial for our setup .",
    "already in the case of quadratic polynomials  @xmath85 , it might occur that the minimization of just the value @xmath86 under the support constraints yields the inappropriate estimator @xmath87 if @xmath18 is not a design point and @xmath88 if @xmath89 because a sufficiently steep parabola always fits the constraints .",
    "this problem is visualized in figure  [ figcompareest ] , where figure  [ figunser](a ) corresponds to estimator ( [ defnestimator ] ) , and figure  [ fighall](b ) to the minimization approach employed in the above references .",
    "note that this problem may or may not occur in practice , but it poses an obstacle for the mathematical analysis .",
    "this is why we work with the base estimators defined in ( [ defnestimator ] ) .",
    "the calculation of our estimator only requires basic linear optimization , but its error analysis will be more involved . note that the formulation as a linear program is particularly important for implementation purposes , since our adaptive procedure requires the computation of many sequential estimators as the bandwidth @xmath90 increases .",
    "[ figunser][fighall ]    the adaptation problem consists of finding an ( asymptotically ) optimal bandwidth @xmath90 when neither the regression function @xmath0 nor the specific boundary behavior of the errors @xmath5 is known , which leads to different convergence rates .",

    "a quasi - negative - hill method is developed in section  [ 32 ] .",
    "in this section we will study the convergence rate of our estimator @xmath102 with @xmath103 as defined in ( [ defnleskiestimator ] ) when the sample size @xmath104 tends to infinity .",

    "an important quantity in the sequel is the approximative tail - function @xmath112 since it asymptotically describes the quantile @xmath113 .",

    "the following fundamental proposition addresses both , the pointwise and the @xmath27-risk of the adaptive estimator , since the pointwise distance of function values at some @xmath18 as well as the @xmath27-distance of functions on @xmath33 $ ] define seminorms for @xmath107 .",

    "the reason for this failure is the severely shifted sample @xmath64 ( we do not observe @xmath8 ) and the particular type of interpolation used in  ( [ eqquantfails ] ) , which leads to an insufficient rate of convergence in the above approach .",

    "]    [ figqq - a ]    the effect of the shape ( type ) of the function on the bandwidth selection is highlighted by a color - scheme , ranging from dark red ( low ) to dark violet ( high ) . in order to understand the `` coloring of the estimator , '' one has to recall that the estimation procedure always tries to fit a local polynomial which `` stays above the observations . '' at first sight , this can lead to a surprisingly large bandwidth selection at particular spots .",
    "the bandwidth size is not necessarily an indicator for estimation accuracy .",
    "the reason for this effect is the maximum function : additional observations are taken into account as long as this does not substantially change the maximum , which can lead to a surprisingly large bandwidth selection .    here , the setup is different from paragraph  ( a ) .",

    "we would like to point out , however , that these estimations are very sample dependent , and due to the relatively small , local sample size , the actual behavior of local samples may deviate significantly from a large sample of @xmath324-distributed random variables .",
